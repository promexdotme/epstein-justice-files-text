# Jeffrey Epstein Justice Files - CONTAINS MANY UNREDACTED -Plain Text Corpus

This repository contains the plain text versions of the released court documents regarding the Jeffrey Epstein/Ghislaine Maxwell cases, originally sourced from the [United States Department of Justice](https://www.justice.gov/).

**Purpose:**
The original documents are provided as PDFs, which are difficult to process programmatically. This repository provides flattened, UTF-8 encoded text files to facilitate:
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for LLMs
- Full-text search and analysis
- Data mining and research

## Data Source
All documents were originally downloaded from the official release portals.
*   **Original Format:** PDF (Scanned/OCR) - Not uploaded [50GB size] of 2024-2025 files but a LINKS page included if you wish to load into a downloader.
*   **Converted Format:** Plain Text (.txt)

## Folder Structure & Naming Convention
To make the dataset easier to ingest, the original nested folder structure has been "flattened." The folder path is preserved in the filename using double underscores (`__`).
