Hi 
Thank you. Let me circle up with a few folks, including BOP, about how best to proceed here, and I will get back to you.

Hi 
(usANys)
::. 
We requested these from the BOP, and they provided a set of documents, which we then produced to defense counsel. 
We did not do a page by page comparison between the redacted set and the unredacted set, so we can't guarantee that 
they are "comprehensive." But we can provide you with what we have, assuming that there aren't any issues with us 
sharing in that way. 
Best,

and 
(USANYS)4 
I recall that at some point you requested a version of the Epstein FOIA documents from BOP without the translucent 
green watermark they put on the withheld documents. Do you have those saved down somewhere? Although the Court 
has not put in a specific order yet, I think it's likely that we'll need to produce documents without the translucent green 
marking to the Court. I have versions without the watermark for some of the does, but it looks like not all. Do you have a 
comprehensive set somewhere? 
Thanks,

Marc and Andy, 
I'm writing to ask for one point of clarification regarding the estate's position regarding the assertion of attorney-client 
privilege. You previously conveyed to us that the estate asserted privilege with respect to devices the FBI seized from 
Jeffrey Epstein's residences in New York and the USVI in 2019. We accordingly assembled a firewall team to conduct a 
privilege review of the contents of those devices. 
The FBI is also in possession of a computer that the Palm Beach Police Department seized from Epstein's residence in Palm 
Beach in 2005, which our office has not reviewed. Is the estate also asserting privilege with respect to devices such as this 
one that were seized in Florida in 2005? 
Thank you,

Dear Counsel: 
Today we are producing certain materials relating to individuals the Government does not 
currently intend to call as witnesses at trial in the above-referenced case. Attached please find an 
index detailing the materials included in today's production. Please note that both the index and 
the enclosed materials are governed by the July 31, 2020 Protective Order in this case. The index 
is itself designated as "confidential," because it includes information regarding records 
designated as "confidential" under the Protective Order. Please note that many of these 
individuals are represented by counsel, as detailed in the attached index. The Government reserves 
its right to amend and supplement these disclosures. 
This production should not be taken to indicate that the Government believes it has any 
obligation to provide all of these materials; rather, we make this production as a courtesy. 
Moreover, although the Government presently does not intend to call the individuals listed in the 
EFTA00026913

that it intends to call any of these individuals at trial.

Might you have any sway in persuading the Marshal permit Ms. Maxwell 
to have her legal materials while in the cell block? 
She arrived today at — 5:15 am and remained idle in the cell block 
until — 8:30 am when she was brought to the fifth floor. 
Otherwise, any opposition to me contacting the Court for an order

April 9, 2021 Call with Dr. Lisa Rocchio 
• 
Opinions and conclusions are based upon 30 years plus of education, training, and 
experience in field of psychology 
• 
There are decades of published and unpublished scientific work in field of forensic and 
clinical psychology, psychological assessment, trauma psychology, interpersonal violence, 
and dynamics and impact of childhood sexual abuse 
• 
Impossible to identify specific works or treatises representing all of accumulated education, 
knowledge, and experience 
• 
Has read published works on complex trauma, psychological assessment and issues 
relating to forensic assessment, psychological trauma, interpersonal violence, childhood 
sexual abuse 
• 
Has also read published personal accounts of individuals who have been abused; literature 
about cultural competency and why that's important in conducting forensic evaluation 
• 
To point to one specific book, journal, or article would not be fair or accurate answer 
• 
Working in field for 30 plus years; information gleaned in process of assessing and 
providing treatment to survivors of childhood sexual abuse as well as work in forensic 
arena, numerous continuing education programs attended by experts in the field 
• 
Can give examples of certain articles or if making particular statements on particular topics, 
can provide sources, as well as identify peer reviewed research supporting position; 
example: National Crime Victim Survey — used to look at prevalence data or 
underreporting of sex crimes 
• 
Opinions not exclusively based on peer reviewed literature but 30 plus years of education, 
training, and experience in clinical and forensic realms 
• 
Commonly known that perpetrators tend to target individuals who they feel they are going 
to be most successful in grooming and gaining compliance 
o In most instances of child sexual abuse, the sexual encounters come later in the 
process of a relationship and that relationship is something that has been established 
over time 
o Perpetrators tend to identify children or individuals with particular needs for 
warmth or affection, identify the needs of that individual, and target kids for whom 
they believe have a way to manipulate or fulfill those needs 
o Perpetrators often target children who lack supervision because need to get access 
o Perpetrators often put themselves in position where have a great deal of access; 
begin slowly and gradually testing boundaries to see how kids respond; kids who 
put up barriers or withdraw or who perpetrator doesn't think will be successful with, 
will move on and move to child with whom will be able to engage in abuse 
• 
Grooming is process by which perpetrator wins over the intended target victim. Begin to 
first identify individual and work to establish relationship with that person and increase 
access 
3502.004 
Page I of 7 
EFTA00026929
--- PAGE 2 ---
o Sometimes means developing relationships with person's parents or other people 
in that person's life so can continue to build trust 
o Over time perpetrator tends to move standard for what is and is not acceptable or 
deviant such that child begins to slowly and incrementally rely more and more on 
perpetrator's definitions of right and wrong 
o Example: less typical that perpetrator on first interaction with individual 
immediately moves toward aggressive sexual assault; more likely that first begin a 
relationship; might take kid out for ice cream, lavish with presents, spend time 
together; maybe in some of those interactions start talking about sexual activity so 
becomes normal; breaking down barriers by talking about sex; then maybe show 
pictures or artwork about sexual activity, maybe do hugging and touch to normalize 
contact; over time incrementally advance towards ultimate end goal of sexual abuse 
• 
High degree of variation based not only on individual characteristics of perpetrators and 
victims, but also based on specific circumstances; sometimes it is a crime of opportunity 
and may be about what is happening in a particular moment; high degree of variability 
o Sometimes grooming process can take long time; sometimes it doesn't and it's 
quick process 
o Violent sexual assault and violent rape is less common among abusers of children 
o Violence and force are not the same; without gaining permission, adult may engage 
in sexual touch that they haven't physically threatened; that is nonconsensual but 
not obtained by threats of violence; compliance not given due to threats of violence; 
o Often kids in that situation are shocked, confused, unsure of what has happened; 
may have conflicting feelings because perpetrator is someone they trust and rely on 
but engaging in sexual abuse 
o Adult who wants to manipulate a child into doing something is at a major advantage 
in terms of their ability to do so 
o Sexual abuse can be accomplished by leading child to believe a particular behavior 
is totally acceptable and normal 
• 
Abusers of child victims are more likely to engage in grooming behaviors and to cultivate 
a relationship with victim to ensure compliance as well as silence 
• 
Vast majority of sexual assault across age span is committed by someone known to the 
victim 
• 
Extremely common for abuse to occur multiple times because abuse occurs in context of 
an established relationship 
o Sexual abuse may escalate over time; perpetrator may move from sexual touch to 
oral contact to intercourse 
o Often times victims of sexual assault maintain attachment and use coping strategies, 
such as disassociation, to put abusive parts out of their mind and focus on the 
attachment and ways in which the relationship meets their needs 
o Attachment in context of child sexual abuse — adult creates situation in which a 
child comes to care for them; adult communicates to child that they care for the 
child in return; engage in behavior especially initially designed to increase trust and 
cause child to be dependent on them for certain needs (e.g., financial, attention, 
basic needs, meals); over time child comes to care deeply about person in spite of 
fact that person is sexually abusing them; perpetrator often works quite hard to 
3502.004 
Page 2 of 7 
EFTA00026930
--- PAGE 3 ---
maintain that connection and ensure subsequent compliance with demands and 
silence 
• 
Child — anyone below the age of consent 
• 
Sexual abuse — nonconsensual sexual touch 
o Nonconsensual: when someone has said no, someone too incapacitated because of 
drugs or alcohol, someone below the age of consent 
• 
Trauma defined as exposure either by directly experiencing or witnesses severe bodily 
injury harm, death, or sexual violence; criterion for PTSD 
• 
Sexual violence is broader term that encompasses sex abuse, sexual harassment, childhood 
sexual abuse, inappropriate unwanted non-consensual behavior; term that is used to define 
trauma in DSM-V 
• 
Kind of behavior perpetrator engages in or offers may vary depending on the age; 
perpetrator is often quite skilled at figuring out what intended target needs or wants 
o For example, adolescents often like to be treated as older than they are; sometimes 
offered access to alcohol, drugs, sense of belonging, physically flattered 
o For young child, perpetrator might offer toys or games or secret fun time; 
o Underlying concepts are the same but ways in which it is carried out can differ 
depending on the age of the individual 
• 
Abuser of adolescent female victim might identify the adolescent's vulnerabilities (figure 
out if she is lonely or feels unattractive) or determine if she doesn't have access to certain 
material things (e.g., items, meals, education, connection to jobs/internships, money, 
vacations trips); may put self in position of being a close friend of adolescent 
• 
Adolescent female victim who is being abused may go back because she is connected or 
attached to the person doing the abuse; continues to return in spite of the abuse because she 
has come to trust, rely upon, and care for the individual 
o As true of many children, adolescents, and adults, she may not recognize that what 
is happening to her is abusive; may come to believe in a special relationship with 
individual and that individual truly cares about her 
o For adolescent, certain kinds of touch can be pleasurable even if abusive in nature; 
o At other times, may be afraid of consequences of saying no; may feel have little 
options or nowhere else to go; may be in need of material goods being provided or 
that may get in trouble if what happened is disclosed; may be fearful of getting 
perpetrator in trouble; number of reasons can vary 
• 
Whether a female victim of sexual abuse returns multiple times to her abuser as opposed 
to a single instance of abuse depends in part on the relationship 
o If someone is in a relationship with person who is abusing them, it is far more likely 
that sexual abuse is something that will occur repeatedly and over the course of 
time 
o Where individual is a child, the onus for how often child is brought back into sphere 
of perpetrator lies with the adult, the perpetrator 
o When there is close connection/relationship or some kind of dependency or fear, 
those factors are designed to keep person engaged in relationship so perpetrator can 
continue to abuse them 
• 
Effects of child sexual abuse on adolescents 
o Often times child and adolescent victims blame themselves 
3502.004 
Page 3 of 7 
EFTA00026931
--- PAGE 4 ---
o Adolescents in particular filled with self-blame and shame because have false sense 
of responsibility or feeling that they are somehow to blame particularly if there was 
coercion and not force; 
o Host of psychological difficulties associated with childhood sexual abuse, 
including but not limited to eating disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, 
physical difficulties, chronic headaches, problems with weight, substance use 
o Young adolescent girls typically engage in other forms of risky sexual behavior 
following sexual abuse 
o All child and adolescent victims of sexual abuse are at increased risk of re-
victimization 
o Being sexually abused creates vulnerability identified by subsequent perpetrators; 
people who have been sexually abused, particularly by someone with whom have 
close personal relationship, are taught over time to ignore internal warning system; 
may not perceive subsequent red flags or grooming behaviors 
o If emotional and sexual abuse has evoked difficulty with shame, low self-worth, 
may increase vulnerability to subsequent abusers and perpetrators; engaged in other 
kinds of high risk behaviors that place them in high risk settings, may make more 
vulnerable 
• 
Impact of childhood sexual abuse on victims into adulthood 
o Opportunity cost because spending time with adult who becomes center focus of 
their world so not engaging in developmentally appropriate or normal social 
activities 
o May not have ability to develop appropriate skills on how to handle anger or 
regulate emotion or have more normal or healthy relationships with same age peers 
o Many of coping strategies that survivors of sexual abuse develop include 
compartmentalization, suppression, denial, or not recognizing that were abused; 
sometimes it is not until adulthood that someone realizes that what happened to 
them was abuse and begins lengthy process of making connections between abuse 
suffered as a child and adult challenges 
• 
Extremely common for survivors of all kinds of sexual abuse to not label experiences as 
sexual abuse 
o For that reason, in scientific field on experiences, talk about behaviors 
o If do survey and speak with 100 individuals and ask if they have been raped, they 
say no; if continue to talk to those individuals and ask if they have been forced to 
have sex against their will or had sex after saying no, or they were too drunk, they 
say yes to those kind of behaviors; when ask college men if they have raped or 
sexually assaulted a woman, they say no; if asked if they ever pushed a woman to 
have sex after she said no, will say yes, but say that's not rape 
• 
Victims of childhood sexual abuse sometimes remain friendly with abusers into victims' 
adulthood 
o Documented in literature and seen in own clinical practice 
o Depends on how old the victim is when become involved with perpetrator, how 
much perpetrator has insinuated themselves into victim's life, to what degree victim 
believes conduct is abusive 
■ 
If believe expression of care, then abuse might continue into adulthood until 
person encounters some new information or person to help recognize 
3502.004 
Page 4 of 7 
EFTA00026932
--- PAGE 5 ---
o Fear of ending relationship with perpetrators also a factor; may be significant 
consequences for person separating from person who has harmed them; to initiate 
separation may result in significant loss of part of victim's life (e.g., fear of public 
shaming or blaming, financial loss) 
o May be forced to confront that relationship was abusive overall which is challenge 
to ways in which coped 
• 
Rape myths: false beliefs that are commonly held by individuals that are presented in media 
(news, television, movies) associated with what rape is. Examples: 
o Rape myth that rape occurs as a result of violent attack perpetrated by a stranger; 
vast majority are perpetrated by someone known to the victim 
o Tend to put lot of blame on rape victim (that what a victim was wearing or drinking 
or circumstance in which she found herself somehow caused rape to occur); only 
person responsible for perpetrator's behavior is perpetrator and those assisting 
perpetrator 
• 
Delayed disclosure 
o Vast majority of sexual assaults and rapes are not reported 
■ 
Studies done using national samples inquire about a range of experiences 
people have had and ask if certain things have happened and whether 
reported to law enforcement agency or another individual 
■ 
Studies looking at crimes reported to agency (e.g., numbers in National 
Crimes Victim database are far lower than incidents of sexual assault) 
o Children often are led to believe that something bad will happen if they disclose; 
depending on age of child, wouldn't occur to child to go to law enforcement agency; 
typically disclosure made because brought to some other adult's attention who then 
brings to attention of law enforcement 
o Unlikely that make disclosure because may perceive that they or perpetrator will 
get into trouble if disclose; perpetrator may tell victim that bad things will happen 
if they tell or that positive thing getting out of relationship (separate and distinct 
from abusive relationship) will cease; if getting certain needs met, disinclined to 
cut relationship off if have dependency or attachment 
• 
Limited disclosure or delayed disclose is very common 
o Extensive scientific literature supports idea that individuals who are harmed as kids 
don't come to disclose or come to an awareness of how they were harmed until later 
in life 
o adults don't become aware that their experiences were abusive or if abusive, degree 
to which harmed or negatively impacted, until later in life 
o Disclosure is not an all or nothing phenomenon; often see incremental disclosure 
where people tell bits and pieces of what is happening but not full story 
o Kids may share information with a peer but less likely to go to an adult 
■ 
That is part of what the grooming process accomplishes; perpetrator 
becomes a trusted and relied upon person in child's life because it has 
likelihood of reducing disclosure 
• 
Incremental disclosure depends in part on how safe the victim feels with person disclosing 
to, how voluntarily they are making the disclosure; certain psychological factors may 
prevent victim from accessing memories of full extent of what happened to them all at once 
3502.004 
Page 5 of 7 
EFTA00026933
--- PAGE 6 ---
o May be experiencing great deal of shame or self-blame so may not want to reveal 
pieces of information that feel is more shameful or afraid in getting in more trouble 
o May still feel in love with person who is hurting them; may desire to protect that 
person or others; may try to deliberately or unconsciously avoid sharing 
information all at once 
o If information shared by someone who is a child, ability to trust other adults may 
already be impaired; 
• 
Impact of sexual abuse during adolescence on memory of abuse 
o Memory for any event, traumatic or otherwise, is not a video screen; comprised of 
multiple components 
o Initially encoding of the memory (what is encoded in someone's circumstances) 
■ 
In traumatic circumstances, only thing person pays attention to are what is 
most salient/big picture, not details 
o Then look at how it is stored (in short term and long term memory) 
■ 
When talk about disclosure later in life, talking about retrieving memory 
■ 
Natural forgetting can happen over time; may forget even if encoded; during 
traumatic event, if someone is disassociating (escaping in minds because 
can't escape in bodies), those individuals may not remember specific 
details; remember key individuals involved, but likely not able to provide 
clear chronological report including all of the details; part of it is because 
that is how memory works 
■ 
Few of us can give accurate report of what happened long ago; memories 
can blur together and can be grouped 
■ 
Remember general act, things that are most relevant and salient 
o With traumatic memory in particular, adrenaline and cortisol in context of fear and 
trauma cause people to narrow focus of attention so likely to tune into most salient 
and relevant things; less likely to attend to details 
o What is extraneous detail for one person may be very salient detail for another 
person 
• 
Expect memories of survivors of child sexual abuse who experience multiple instances of 
abuse to be impacted by abuse occurring multiple times 
o If someone is abused by a variety of different people over the course of time, 
majority of individuals will remember key facts associated with that traumatic 
experience, who person was 
o May not remember specific details about what month it was or where occurred if 
multiple assailants and multiple acts 
o Very common for victim's memories to run together if perpetrator abused victims 
multiple times over years; what is most relevant is that person is doing this behavior 
multiple times over time; may be able to remember some of places where happened, 
but very common for memories of similar occurrences to jumble together 
• 
In process of grooming, how common for there to be someone who assists primary abuser 
in grooming but not necessarily the abuse itself; how presence of someone who helps in 
grooming process facilitating the sexual abuse 
• 
Documented cases in literature of individuals who assist the primary perpetrator in the 
grooming process and facilitate the sexual abuse but do not necessarily participate in abuse 
themselves 
3502.004 
Page 6 of 7 
EFTA00026934
--- PAGE 7 ---
o Abuse with multiple perpetrators occurs, not unusual 
o Multiple perpetrators don't have to engage in physical sexual abuse (e.g., fraternity 
house, alcohol spiked, number of people get a drunk girl to a particular bedroom; 
someone else assaults her) 
o Sometimes individuals use other people as a way to break down someone's 
defenses to help them appear to be a more safe and trusted individual 
o Involved in a case where perpetrator frequently had one of his younger assistants 
who he had also sexually abused over course of many years but who was now an 
adult with him when he would connect with other young boys; presence of young 
man who made it seem ok to be there 
o If multiple adults engaging in sexual conversation around child, adds to idea that 
this is appropriate, this is what adults do; helps create false sense of security on part 
of child that what is happening is ok, normal, acceptable 
• 
Based on years of experience working with individuals, know that young children in 
particular often feel more comfortable in the presence of a woman; adolescent girls might 
bring a friend with them if they are going out with a guy or group of guys; sense of security 
that there is someone else like them 
• 
Factors that could help disarm intended victim 
o Person helping perpetrator shares a common interest with the perpetrator and 
functions to make an introduction or serve as bridge; that person may hold certain 
qualities that victim is known to respond positively to; person might possess certain 
skills in terms of ability to make initial connection; person might serve to normalize 
what might be othenvise viewed as inappropriate or deviant behavior 
• 
Vast majority of sex crimes committed by men and vast majority of victims are girls and 
women. However, sexual abuse also occurs in same sex relationships, women are capable 
of and have committed heinous sex abuse crimes and have been active perpetrators of child 
sexual abuse even though statistically in lesser number than male perpetrators 
• 
LR has not met or interviewed victims in this case 
• 
LR is aware of multiple news reports about Epstein and Maxwell as his longtime 
companion 
• 
LR is aware of allegations by some victims that Maxwell was present for or participated in 
or knew about the abuse 
• 
LR has seen photographs of Epstein and Maxwell on the news with celebrity figures (e.g., 
Trump, Clinton, Prince Andrew) 
• 
LR is aware that there have been multiple documentaries and podcasts and interviews with 
various people 
o LR read some articles that raised questions about the initial plea deal that Epstein 
negotiated in Florida 
o LR saw one of documentaries about Epstein on Netflix (Filthy Rich) 
o Heard some episodes of podcast called Seeking Justice; not sure which episodes 
o Reviewed those before retained as expert witness 
• 
Relevant to LR and her profession; helpful to be aware of popular culture 
• 
Information provided today was based on LR's knowledge, experience, training 
• 
LR was asked to avoid viewing or reviewing media reports about the case to the extent 
possible

2021.03.03 call with Dr. Rocchio 
Wednesday, March 3, 2021 1:24:41 PM 
AUSAs 
on call with Dr. Rocchio 
• Dr. Rocchio has been working with survivors of sexual trauma since graduate training on, 
including while at Yale in post-doctoral training. Primary client population in post-doctoral 
training were clients receiving therapy designed to treat primarily women who were suicidal, 
the vast majority of whom had experienced some sort of trauma and abuse. Then when in 
private practice, since 1998, trauma has been Dr. Rocchio's area of expertise and specialty. So 
the majority of clients she has worked with have experienced some form of trauma, including 
a lot of childhood sexual trauma. Dr. Rocchio has also conducted assessments for courts that 
involved assessing juveniles with significant mental health difficulties, the majority of whom 
had experienced some form of sexual trauma. She has been involved in assessment and 
treatment of sexual trauma throughout entire career. 
o Beginning of her career, as high as 80% of clients were victims of child sexual abuse, 
that percentage has varied over the years from a minimum of a third to as much as 
80% of her clients, currently approximately 50% of her clients 
o Dr. Rocchio is currently the president-elect of APA trauma committee (on CV) and 
fellow of that organization 
o Has treated and evaluated hundreds upon hundreds victims of trauma, been working 
for 25 years, and takes at least 20 clients (sometimes more) per year 
• Has sought specialized training involving sexual trauma: 
o Took graduate school courses on violence and women 
o Have taken additional trainings regarding trauma, including numerous continuing 
education programs as both a student and a teacher regarding treatment of trauma in 
a clinical setting 
o Training include assessment and treatment of trauma and childhood sexual abuse, as 
well as specific to forensic assessment of trauma in criminal and civil settings 
• Has been involved in multiple different types of civil and criminal cases involving trauma 
victims

----------------------------------------
April 21, 2021 Call with Dr. 
• 
Dr. Rocchio's training is over the course of her career, not just in graduate school. The 
topics included traumatic stress (the effects of trauma), and clinical as well as forensic 
psychology. 
• 
Dr. Rocchio has written about, presented, and conducted numerous trainings on the 
assessment and treatment of trauma. 
• 
Dr. Rocchio also trains psychiatric residents at Brown in treating trauma survivors. 
• 
Dr. Rocchio's testimony is based on her education as well as her training, experience, and 
research. 
• 
Saying that victims are "susceptible" puts the onus on victims. It is more accurate to say 
that individuals or victims are "targeted." 
• 
Sexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of manipulation or coercion in 
the context of an established relationship that is developed over time rather than through 
the use of forcible rape. 
• 
It's not fair to say that the presence of women can "especially" facilitate the sexual abuse 
of minors. Abusers might use all sorts of other people. 
• 
Victims are often subject to a strategic pattern of behaviors that can take a variety of forms 
and function to obscure the nature of the abuse and to build trust and attachment with their 
abuser. That relationship of trust and attachment, in turn, can prevent victims from being 
aware that what they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure. Minor victims 
may therefore not identify what's happening as abusive at the time or during the course of 
the abuse and may not recognize the consequences of that abuse until adulthood. 
• 
Most sexual assaults go unreported and disclosures are often made long after the incident. 
Nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual 
abuse for a variety of reasons, which can include fear, shame, humiliation, fear of not being 
believed, and fear of retaliation. 
• 
Re memory: memory for and disclosure of traumatic/abusive events is impacted by a 
number of factors. Dr. Rocchio can testify about the research regarding the various factors 
that go into how people can remember abuse—what's encoded to begin with, which pieces 
are remembered. That can include the circumstances surrounding the trauma, but also other 
things. The remembering process can be a piece, but just one piece. 
• 
Repeated exploitation/abuse can increase the likelihood of victimization later in life and 
has been shown to result in long-term traumatic and psychological consequences, including 
the ways in which the victim interacts with the legal system. 
• 
Numerous scientific studies show the significant psychological harm that can result from 
childhood sexual victimization. 
• 
Complex trauma is significant for repeated episodes of repeated childhood sexual abuse. 
It's associated with more harmful outcomes than PTSD. 
o Complex trauma = trauma that involves repetitive or prolonged exposure to or 
experiences of multiple traumatic stressors, involves harm or abandonment by 
3502405 
Page I of 2 
EFTA00026937
--- PAGE 2 ---
caregivers or other trusted adults, and occurs at developmentally vulnerable times 
in a person's life, especially during childhood. 
o When childhood sexual abuse occurs under those conditions, it can be considered 
complex trauma 
o The prolonged nature of complex trauma and the resulting disruption to an 
individual's psychological development can result in profound dysregulation in 
emotional control, problems with attention/concentration, distorted perceptions of 
self/the perpetrator/others, severe traumatic/medical problems, and difficulties with 
identity/relationships/suicidality/behavioral control. 
■ 
Distorted perceptions of the perpetrator: may view the perpetrator as 
someone who has been particularly loving, all powerful or all malevolent, 
someone who intended to do good, etc. Different ways, but it impacts how 
the victim view that person. 
• Dr. Rocchio's testimony relies on her education and training on psychological trauma, 
traumatic stress, interpersonal violence, and childhood sexual abuse. (That includes her 
knowledge of the literature.) She has also provided education and training, not just 
received it. 
• Dr. Rocchio also has a forensic practice conducting forensic psychological evaluations of 
people who have experienced sexual abuse and trauma. 
• Dr. Rocchio is also a member of the APA Ethics Committee. 
• 
Dr. Rocchio's practice involves supervising 7 other employees

2-3 Specifications/MA Statement 
The United States Attorneys' Office (USAO) conducts litigation in the Southern District of New York on behalf of the United States 
of America. Frequently. there is a need for expert witness work prior to a case going to trial and during the trial. When appropriate. 
and pursuant to guidelines implemented by the Department of Justice, a USAO may enter into contracts with expert witnesses, 
functioning as independent contractors, to conduct record reviews and data analyses in preparation for testimony in person or by 
written report and to provide such testimony in court or by trial deposition. In this particular case, the USAO has determined that 
an expert witness is necessary to testify in litigation for the government and such services are not available from the agency being 
represented or from another agency. 
Through this statement of work, the USAO is seeking the services of a contractor to review records, analyze data, interview witnesses. 
prepare testimony, testify, and other work pertinent to the case. 
Retention 
The contractor will be available to commence work for the USAO upon receipt of an executed copy of this contract or a verbal notice 
to proceed. The contractor agrees not to work for any other person or party involved in this case on matters relating to this case for 
thirty (30) days after he/she is verbally retained, or upon acceptance of this contract, unless notified earlier by the USAO. Should the 
thirty (30) days lapse without receipt of an executed contract or notice to proceed, the contractor is free to accept work from any other 
Party-
ScopestWork 
The contractor shall: 
Provide all plant. labor, material and equipment except as otherwise provided to perform expert witness services as required by USAO 
and in connection with such services agrees to perform such document review, studies and research so as to be able to testify in person 
or by written report as an expert witness with respect to the contractor's findings. 
Testify as an expert witness during the trial either in person or by written report. unless notified to the contrary by the AUSA, and 
must be willing to comply with all requirements of the court as well as local and/or federal rules for such purpose. 
Assist the USAO in the obtaining of one or more additional expert witnesses, as needed to support the testimony of the contractor 
in person or by written report. who are competent and willing to render a scientifically-supportable opinion and sign an appropriate 
affidavit, acceptable to the expert. prepared by the USAO, based upon the findings of the expert and the facts of the Case. 
Exercise neutrality and maintain independence. The contractor shall determine the manner in which the services are to be performed 
and the specific hours to be worked by the contractor except when the contractor's testimony is required at a specific time and place. 
Be of good professional standing and moral character, generally board eligible or board certified in the area of specialty or having 
other appropriate qualifications through training or experience; to act as the USAO's expert witness in the Case, the rendering of oral 
and written opinions, the signing of affidavits, giving depositions or courtroom testimony under oath and directly consulting with the 
USAO.

15JA5421P00000117 Page 7 of 19 
The full scope of contractor's work will be determined as the matter proceeds, and will be subject to the needs and requests of the 
USAO. Occasionally the complexity of the case requires more review hours than initially estimated. Any time it becomes apparent 
to the contractor that he/she will need to exceed the time and cost estimates provided to complete his/her work, he/she will provide the 
USAO with a revised estimate and shall proceed only after being granted permission by the USAO. 
Specific deliverables known at this time include: 
In United States v. Maxwell. the Government has charged the defendant with various crimes related to the sexual abuse of mionrs. The 
Government anticipates that this case will proceed of trial. At trial, Dr. Rocchio will serve as a testifying expert to explain various 
topics related sexual abuse and trauma. Specifically, Dr. Rocchio will serve as a testifying expert, based on her professional 
experience and research, regarding the psychology of sexual abuse, including by explaining the following concepts: grooming, 
delayed reporting of child sexual abuse, attachments that form between abusers and victims of sexual abuse, and the effects of sexual 
abuse on memory. 
In advance of her trial testimony. Dr. Rocchio will meet with the Government for preparation sessions; assist the Government in 
responding to motions related to her expert testimony, as needed: and review any materials provided by the Government, or other 
relevant materials relevant to the above subject matters as necessary in advance of her testimony. 
Dr. Rocchio shall be compensated at a rate of $450 per hour to perform the work described above, including travel time. 
This list of deliverables may not be all inclusive; additional deliverables may be identified by the USAO throughout the duration of 
this contract. 
FAR 31.205.46 Travel Costs. When travel is authorized by the Government. transportation, lodging, meals and incidental expenses 
will be reimbursed in accordance with conditions set out in the Federal Travel Regulation (Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations). 
Rates listed elsewhere in this contract for mileage and per diem are subject to change and will be reimbursed in accordance with the 
rates established by the Federal Travel Regulation. Federal Travel Regulations may be found at this address: http://www.gsa.gov/. 
Option to Extend Term of the Contract 
The Government may unilaterally extend the term of this contract by written notice to the contractor provided the Government does so 
before the contract expires. If any such extension causes an increase in the cost of performance on the contractor then the contractor 
may, within 30 days, request an equitable adjustment in the contract price. The Government shall make an equitable adjustment in the 
contract price and modify the contract to reflect the adjustment for all fair and reasonable requests. The total duration of this contract, 
including unilateral extensions, may extend no longer than 90 days beyond disposition of the Case. 
Relationship of the Parties 
Notwithstanding any provision hereof, for all purposes of this contract the contractor shall be and act as an independent contractor 
and not an employee of the USAO, thereby incurring all expenses associated with the work, including any overhead and other direct 
costs. The USAO will not provide fringe benefits, including health insurance benefits, paid vacations, or any other employee benefit, 
for the contractor. The contractor shall make no representation as an agent, employee, partner. or joint venturer of USAO. The 
contractor shall have no authority to bind nor attempt to bind USAO or incur other obligations on behalf of USAO. The contractor is 
an independent contractor and is solely responsible for all taxes, withholdings, and other statutory or contractual obligations of any 
sort, including, but not limited to, Workers' Compensation Insurance; and the contractor agrees to defend, indemnify and hold USAO 
harmless from any and all claims, damages, liability, attorneys' fees and expenses on account of an alleged failure by the contractor to 
satisfy any such obligations or any other obligation (under this contract or otherwise). If the contractor is a corporation, it will ensure 
that its employees and agents are bound in writing to the contractor's obligations under this Contract. 
Confidentiality 
The contractor recognizes that the USAO has and will have law enforcement interests, as well as non-privileged information obtained 
from federal agencies and employees, and other proprietary information (collectively "information") which are valuable, special and 
unique assets of the USAO. The contractor agrees that other than provided by law, he/she will at no time or under any circumstances, 
directly, or indirectly, divulge, disclose, or communicate information to a third party, or use it for its own benefit without the prior 
written permission from the USAO. The contractor may disclose information to its employees and subcontractors, who may be 
working on the case, in order to facilitate the testimony to be provided by the expert in person or by written report, unless notified 
to the contrary by the USAO. The contractor and its employees and subcontractors will protect the information and treat it as strictly 
confidential.

individual tax or medical information (such as medical utilization reports from carriers, workers' compensation claim files, personnel 
tiles, or court records which include medical or tax reports). The contractor agrees that the following additional safeguards apply to 
such information: 
The contractor shall be responsible for safeguarding the information or data while under the control of or available to the contractor 
and to prevent it from being compromised. altered, damaged, lost, or improperly disseminated. The contractor shall use such 
information solely for purposes of the particular court case.

ensure that any such persons use such information solely or purposes of the particular court case and protect the confidentiality of such 
information. 
The contractor shall ensure that all records are maintained securely so that access is strictly limited. 
At the end of the contractor's engagement in this matter, all copies of such records shall be returned to the USAO. 
All questions about these safeguards and the records which they cover shall be directed to the AUSA.

Contractors using information systems that are subject to the data security requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) already are subject to the data security standards outlined below, and, therefore, only paragraphs 
(g), (h), and (i) apply. 
(a) 
Contractors must ensure that computer hardware is secure and shall take the steps outlined below: 
(I) Keep your firewall turned on: A firewall helps protect your computer from hackers who might try to gain access 
to crash it, delete information, or even steal passwords or other sensitive information. Software firewalls are widely 
recommended for single computers. The software is prepackaged on some operating systems or can be purchased 
for individual computers. For multiple networked computers, hardware routers typically provide firewall protection, 
although the contractor must verify this. 
(2) Computers must be protected by username/password logins and password-protected screensavers (after 15-
min. idle). Computer accounts cannot be shared with other users. Contractors must report an incident to the EOUSA 
Security Operations Center at 
within one hour if their account is accessed by another user. 
(3) Install and update your antivirus software: Antivirus software is designed to prevent malicious software 
programs from embedding in your computer. If it detects malicious code, like a virus or a worm, it works to disarm or 
remove it. Viruses can infect computers without users' knowledge. Most types of antivirus software can be set up to 
update automatically. 
(4) Install and update your antispyware technology: Spyware is just what it sounds like—software that is 
surreptitiously installed on your computer to let others peer into your activities on the computer. Some spyware 
collects information about you without your consent or produces unwanted pop-up ads on your web browser. Some 
operating systems offer free spyware protection, and inexpensive software is readily available for download on the 
Internet or at your local computer store. Be wary of ads on the Internet offering downloadable antispyware—in some 
cases these products may be fake and may actually contain spyware or other malicious code. 
(5) Maintain active and supported operating systems and application software. Computer operating systems (e.g., 
Windows 8.0) and application software (e.g., Microsoft Word) have a lifecycle that begins when a product is released 
and ends when it's no longer supported. Install and maintain security updates and fixes updated to stay in tune with 
technology requirements and to fix security holes. Be sure to install the updates to ensure your computer has the latest 
protection. 
(6) Be careful what you download: Carelessly downloading e-mail attachments can circumvent even the most vigilant 
anti-virus software. Never open an e-mail attachment from someone you don't know and be wary of fonvarded 
attachments from people you do know. They may have unwittingly advanced malicious code. 
(7) Turn off your computer: With the growth of high-speed Internet connections, many opt to leave their computers 
on and ready for action. The downside is that being "always on" renders computers more susceptible. Beyond firewall 
protection, which is designed to fend off unwanted attacks, turning the computer off effectively severs an attacker's 
connection—be it spyware or a botnet that employs your computer's resources to reach out to other unwitting users. 
(b) 
You must encrypt files related to this project on your computer whenever you are not working on them using 
a standard software encryption product such as Winzip (Version 18.5 or later with the Windows FIPS 140-2 validated 
cryptographic modules enabled). Securezip. or any other product that meets Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 
140-2. If you do not already have a suitable encryption program on your computer, you can download one of these products 
easily. 
(c) 
If the data under this contract will be accessed by more than one person, rules of behavior must be signed by users. 
These rules shall address at a minimum: authorized and official use; prohibition against unauthorized users; and protection of 
sensitive data and PH. You can comply by having all users sign these rules: I. Keep all data and information received from 
the government confidential. 2. Do not leave it unattended in a place where an unauthorized person might read, copy, or take 
it. 3. Do not transmit it without encryption from one computer to another. 4. If confidentiality is breached, inform [name 
principal of the contractor] within one hour of suspected breach so the United States can fulfill its obligations. 
(d) 
All Pit data must be deleted from all contractor-owned devices within 15 days of contract termination or contractor 
completion. The Contracting Officer (CO) must receive a written certification, either via email or letter, that the contractor has

deleted all PII. This bulletin outlines approved method of data destruction; please see Appendix I. which begins on page 26: 
http://nvIpubs.nist.govinistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-88r1.pdf. 
(e) 
All files related to this project, and contractor-owned removable media (such as removable hard drives, flash drives. 
CDs, or floppy disks containing DO) data) shall not be removed from DOJ facilities (either physically or electronically, 
such as by email) unless encrypted using a NIST FIPS 140-2 approved product. Please note that this requirement refers to 
transferring information between systems and storage devices (such as back and forth between contractor and DOJ attorney), 
while paragraph (b) above applies to data while it is on your computer. 
NOTE: As an alternative to media encryption, Dal data may be securely exchanged between contractors and USAO personnel 
via the approved U.S. Attorneys' File Exchange (USAfx) web portal.

Hello — attached are the pages 
sent me to provide to you. Here is a bit of an explanation and I also asked her to 
take a copy of the front and back of the journal book which she did. Hope this helps. Please let me know if you need 
anything else: 
"The shortest page and the one that is the hardest to read is the first entry from 12/95. It is written in colored 
pencil and is fading. There are then two pages from 01/07/1996 where I talk about the highlights of my NY trip 
and going to Epstein's house and then the next entry from 01/25/1996 is where I talk about going to the movies 
with him."

Let me follow up with 
about her journal. I know she shared some pictures with you from around the time period 
when she was with Epstein/Maxwell. I will ask her about the journal ASAP and will get back to you and will check with her 
to see if she has anything else that might be helpful to the investigation.

Hi Sigrid,

Hope you had a wonderful holiday season and very happy New Year. We wanted to follow up on a request we made after 
interviewing 
a few months ago. During her interview, 
referred to several entries in her journal that 
had helped refresh her recollection of the events involving Epstein and Maxwell. As we mentioned at the end of the 
interview, it would be very helpful to our investigation if we could review those journal entries, as well as any other 
records or documents 
may have that relate to her experiences with Epstein and Maxwell. 
Would 
be willing to share with us any relevant journal entries (or any other relevant documents she may have) to 
assist in our investigation? 
Happy to have a call to discuss if that would be helpful.

but it finally came this morning, so with apologies for the short turnaround, hoping to get Office and final DOJ

I'm talking to the team about discovery generally at 3, so if there have been any developments, or, in particular, anything 
more I should be asking them, let me know.

As expected, FBI is pretty resistant to using a vendor. I explained to 
that we just can't mess around with this 
anymore. She is going to get updated information about status and we will talk again later today (her team told her that 
we have been provided with roughly 30 of 52 devices, so obviously our information is not matching up).

Pretty sure it's everything. The estimate references 57 devices, as noted below, I think we're now up to 62, but we're into 
one of them, so really 61. We can get an updated estimate for the 61 if that would be helpful, but given how much 
business the PC unit gives 
he should be good to us on that...

Yes, there are a total of 62 devices which can be divided into three main buckets based on how/where we obtained them, 
the second and third of which are by far and away the biggest: 
• 
Phone and 1 iPad seized from Epstein at the time of his arrest on July 6, 2019. The FBI first delivered copies of 
the extractions from these devices last week. We were able to review the iPad, but we have not been able to 
open the iPhone data. IS THIS AN FBI TRANSMISSION ISSUE WITH THE IPHONE DATA, OR IS IT THAT IT WAS UN-
OPENABLE? 
• 
electronic devices seized from the New York residence on July 11, 2019. These include multiple hard drives, 
multiple computers, multiple USB drives, and multiple iPads. We currently have extractions from/access to none 
of them.

Following up on the below, I think we've given this our absolute best efforts with FBI — they are now well over a 
month later than their estimate from April on when we would get the New York materials, they're also past their 
estimate of getting us the New York materials from just this Monday, and we don't have anything close to an 
estimate on the USVI materials, which constitute the overwhelming majority of the data and are vastly more 
voluminous than the New York devices. We have kept pushing the timeline back for this option, hoping that CART 
will finalize, but I think at this point we should have a vendor do it. 
Attached is an estimate we got from BRG, which would get everything to us in under a month, and in Relativity-
friendly format, in a range of $85-135K. BRG has done this for our office multiple times in the past and are very 
effective and efficient, and they get the materials we need. And most importantly, they estimate they can do it all in 
less than a month. May we have approval to seek funding for this? The estimate is attached. Thanks very much.

You are getting both NY and USVI. The biggest stumbling block are the newer Mac items that are in APFS

I am in the process ofAtoorting the materials (documents, spreadsheets, emails, etc) for your review as per 
my discussions with =. 
Most of the NY stuff is done, just Mac items left. This might take a few days as 
item in particular has over 500,000 emails. We will be able to provide discovery once Defense Council 
has provided drives for us to copy items over to. This goes quicker as there is no processing involved. ni let

Unfortunately, recent events and our staffing levels have conspired to put a kink in just about everything. If 
we can't make heads or tails of the stuff I've already produced, we'll do it again. They have told us that our 
staffing levels will be steadily increasing over the next few weeks, but I'm going to have to push back my 
estimate by a week or 2. Sony about that. My next day in the office is Thursday, so I'll be able to see if I can 
easily identify what I already gave you and marry it to a reliable identifier.

Thanks for this, it's a helpful start. In terms of being able to write our search warrant, one additional piece of 
information we need is the serial number, or some other specific identifier, ideally for each device but at least for any 
device that there is more than one of the same thing. So for example, we need to be able to somehow differentiate 
the following devices —
The two Dell power edge T310 hard drives (NYCO24323 and NYCO24324) 
The two Sony Vaio laptop / Fujitsu hdd (NYCO24336 and NYCO24337) 
the following loose storage devices: 
o Micro SD card (NYCO24339) 
o Flash Drive (generic) (NYCO24340) 
o Thumbdrive (Emtec) (NYCO24341) 
o hard drive (loose) (NYCO24342) 
o verbatim thumbdrive (NYCO24343) 
The four San Disk cruzer-thumbdrives (NYCO24344-47) 
The three Seagate IDE hard drives (NYCO24348-50) 
The camera SD card (NYCO24351) 
I think the rest of the devices are either specifically distinguishable and/or have an S/N listed. (By comparison, the 
USVI spreadsheet we have lists an s/n for about 20 of the 25(ish) devices. 
The other thing we're looking for is the location in the house (and ideally specific location) for each device, which the 
USVI list also has — is that info available? 
The list also has just five devices as still pending to be transferred to us, and I think it's right that the plan is to 
reproduce all the materials so that we can get them in searchable format, but just wanted to confirm? Currently, we 
aren't able to match any of the prior productions to specific devices — so if we're able to match them up by Bates

Here is The listing of all the evidence gathered in NY that I have. I added some columns to guide you to the 
unique numbers CART NY uses fro their evidence. The template wasn't a slam dunk over, so I did what I 
could to convey the information. If you are confused by anything, please let me know. In the column for 
approximate size, it is in GB, totaled at the bottom and converted to TB. In the materials contained column, 
I put what load file group the data was transferred over in (Mac, Windows, Loose Media, IDE, or Blacklight) 
If there is no entry in that column, that data has yet to be transferred. There are 2 Macs and a DVR you 
don't have as well as an iPhone and an iPad. IF the descriptions are a bit light, let me know and I'll do what 
I can to beef them up. I will get you the Island stuff tomorrow.

Respectfully, I think there are some miscommunications here — all we have asked is to receive the materials in a 
format such that we can view them using a system we have access to. We're not able to get web-enabled access 
through any FBI tool, so we asked for the materials to be transferred in a loadable format so we could put them on 
Relativity, which both we and the agents can access. We're required to have the files in a format that we can 
produce them to defense counsel. I've done that in many other cases and it hasn't previously been an issue. My 
understanding from 
is that the best way to do it now is just for us (the U.S. Attorney's Office) to get the original 
files, which our vendor will process—by which I just mean converting into file formats that are loadable onto 
Relativity. It doesn't really have anything to do with the taint review—we have to have access to the docs in our 
systems for discovery purposes. 
And we were happy to get the materials as they were processed, but when we received the 1.1 million documents 
earlier this year, they were in a format that wasn't usable for the reasons described in the email I sent on March 9. 
Again, I understand from 
that the best way forward is to just get copies of the materials in their original 
formats, which I understand will be segregated and designated by device. That should work for usl I was just trying 
to understand the approach, as well as the timeline. 
thanks,

Just to be clear. The US Attorney's Office (or it's contractors) are not "processing" anything. You are taking 
files that I will be extracting from processed evidence and putting them into an E-Discovery tool (Relativity) 
to do a taint review. 
Relativity is NOT a forensic tool. It is incapable of dealing with many things that are found forensically on a 
computer like free space, slack space, and system files to name a few. When we started this, and you 
insisted you do the taint review in Relativity, I warned you that it was adding months worth of work on top 
of what was already done, and that Relativity was incapable of viewing everything. You insisted we do it 
this way. So now 
and I have come up with a way to fit this round peg into this square hole. We will get 
it done. 
Sorry it has taken so long, but we are talking about terabytes worth of data over multiple forms of digital 
evidence. Phones, tablets, loose media, cameras, DVRs, servers, laptops, and desktop computers. We have 
gotten past encryption on multiple devices. When we review devices on such large cases, we usually do it 
piece by piece as things are processed, I was unaware that you didn't want to review as things were 
processed, that you wanted to do it "all at once", so that added to the delay. Sorry for that. Just a 
differentiation of methodology I suppose. 
and I feel confident that the method we have come up with will be more consistent and preserve the 
attribution of files to devices and links of e-mails to attachments that the load file generation that I did a 
while back was lacking.

Okay, so just to check, you both think that there is not a need to do a test run? You're both comfortable with just 
basically sending us copies of everything? I don't totally understand why we couldn't have done that eight months 
ago, but regardless of the passage of time, I want to make sure we understand so we can report to our supervisors. I 
assume that means that we (at the U.S. Attorney's Office and through contractors) will therefore need to do all the 
processing ourselves, correct? And thanks again to you both.

Understood, thanks—it will be great to get that list on Thursday. As a refresh, the info we are looking for is in the 
attached spreadsheet template. 
On the returns themselves, do the changes you mentioned mean that the estimate of a month from now for 
complete transmission of the search warrant returns is no longer likely? If so could you please let us know what the 
current estimate would be, so we can factor that in? Thanks very much.

Sony for the delay, they reduced us to 1 day a week, so things have been stretched out by a factor of 5. I 
will be back in the office on Thursday and will be able to get you the list then as I have to access some of 
our systems to do so. 
Also, 
please reach out to me at one of the numbers below so we can brain storm. Thanks.

Following up on the below, I think you had said you expected to be able to get us a list of the devices seized from the 
search warrants at Epstein's residences in New York and the USVI, as well as from his person upon arrest, in about a 
month (during our conference call a month ago) — so wanted to check if we can still expect that very soon? We're 
waiting on that list to be able to do an updated search warrant on all of those devices. Please let us know the 
current timeline — and also the current timeline on producing the results from those August and September 
searches? I think you and 
were going to coordinate on that, and you had mentioned you expected we'd have it 
a couple months from our call, which would be about a month from now. Wanted to make sure we're still on track.

Unfortunately I don't think this is very helpful to us. Did you take a look at the example spreadsheet I sent on 2/24? 
The excel file you sent has descriptions that don't match up to the items listed in the search warrant returns (that we 
sent on 2/23), and we don't have the 1B or CART numbers to be able to cross-reference. We also can't tell what you 
mean by "loose media" without a specific comparison to what was seized, we don't know which items you're 
referring to as "Windows machines," and we can't tell whether the entirety of any particular item has been 
transferred, or just partial. For example, it looks like we have gotten very, very few image files, which is surprising. 
We have also encountered some very significant problems in trying to review the more than 1 million documents we 
recently received: 
The data we've received has no way to put any emails and attachments together. So if an email says, "see 
the attached flight records," for example, we have no way of linking that up with the records themselves. 
Not only is that a big problem for us in review, it's going to be a huge problem for producing the documents 
to defense counsel. 
The load file has no link to the native file, so when we load the data to the database, there's no way to have 
the native files show up in the database. Because many of the files are too large to open in the viewer, it 
effectively means that there are many files that are completely invisible to us. 
Related, the control numbers in the load file don't match up to the native files. So we have two sets of 
numbers and no way to match up anything—that is, even if we were to try to go hunt down every individual 
large file in the native files, it would be impossible. 
So the data that we most recently got, we need to get in a form that addresses those issues, and we likely will need 
to get a similar reproduction of the data we received a couple months ago. Otherwise we're sifting through more 
than a million documents without much rhyme or reason. 
I've re-attached the spreadsheet we sent last week — I think that's a good place to start in terms of our necessary 
record-keeping, and we need that info at the very least, as well as anything else you think would be useful. Also 
attaching the SW returns for reference. And again, we're happy to meet up anytime and hash all this out in person if 
that's useful.

Here is a listing of what I have already handed over in load files to the US Attorney's Office for taint review. Some 
points of clarification: There were 9 IDE hard drives found in the Manhattan apartment, they turned out to be 3 
copies of 3 drives (9 drives in total) from a July 2007 search on one of his properties. I only processed 3 (as they were 
all copies). All the loose media from the NY apartment is included. All the Windows machines from the NY apartment 
are included. Only 2 Macs from NY and 1 from the Island are included. 
I will have to more closely coordinate with whoever is loading up Relativity with the remaining Macs as the 
tool they have to be processed with does not easily re-name the load files.

Totally understand about the network issues—we can relate. I do still think it will be helpful to all sit down together 
to have an in-person discussion, to make sure everybody is on the same page. Are folks available for that next 
week? And what I think would be most helpful to facilitate that would be a spreadsheet of each separate device 
referenced in the two search warrant returns, with columns for whether we've dumped the contents, whether 
they've been reviewed and/or transferred, what portions were transferred, etc. 
Something roughly like the attached, with any other categories you think would be useful — and the info on the 
attached is mostly hypothetical, obviously, just as examples. That will help us fully understand what's been reviewed, 
transferred, and received so far, and what remains. 
(Also just on the pictures, we do want copies of those as well, please including from the discs and the devices — I 
think FBI was going to do an initial screen to make sure no CP, and since I think the answer was no, we'll need to get 
those to be able to review them as well.)

Sorry for the delayed response. They are tearing out our old network and giving us a new one, they 
mandated we delete old stuff (about 400 TB worth). Now that they are working on replacing the network, 
we can do only local work. I should be able to give you an accounting of what is what. I can say, off the top 
of my head, that all windows based items from the NY search have been handed over as well as all loose 
media. The CDs from NY only contained pictures, no documents. There are still some Apple items from NY 
that need to be produced. As far as the Island stuff goes, the 1st item on your spreadsheet, the "kitchen" mac 
has been produced. Still working on the rest.

Following up on the below from last weekend, I'm still not sure how we're addressing this so I thought it would make 
sense for us to all schedule a (hopefully relatively brief) meeting to all get on the same page? We didn't hear back on 
which files had previously been provided, but our tech folks did their best to differentiate, and we got access to the 
materials yesterday and its well over a million documents, and we don't have any idea what we're looking at — i.e., 
EFTA00026995
--- PAGE 18 ---
which devices the materials came from, whether it's full or partial results, how many more devices we have coming, 
etc. 
Based on the attached search warrant returns, it looks like from the New York mansion (the PDF) there are 
approximately 40 devices that would have storage (computers, hard drives, thumb drives, etc.) and that's not even 
counting at least 60+ CDs. And then from the Virgin Islands (the Excel spreadsheet), at least more than 25 devices, 
including multiple servers / server racks. 
So we gotta know what we've already received, what remains, anticipated schedule, etc, and I know it's a lot of 
moving pieces on all sides so wanted to loop in everybody at once. The case team will be in California this coming 
week from Tuesday through Friday, but then I think generally around the first week of March, which will hopefully be 
plenty of time to schedule a productive meeting.

I'm not sure who's the exact right person to ask this, so wanted to get everybody on one email chain about it — I have 
the hard drive that 
dropped off that has new Epstein search warrant materials, but it looks like there are also 
old materials (that I think we had previously received and uploaded??) on the hard drive, and so I'm not sure what's 
new. 
Just generally, and 
and I talked about this last week too, but it's basically impossible for us to keep track of 
what we're getting, and what has been completed, without some kind of identification or labeling system, along with 
a list of which devices have been extracted and downloaded. 
So for example on the hard drive currently, there are 38 folders labeled "loadFiles" through "37loadFiles" with a 
modified date of 11/14/19, which I think we may have already previously received — but I'm not sure, because we 
haven't gotten any info on which folders match up to which devices, etc. And then there's another folder titled 
"NYC024362" that has a modified date of 1/27/20, so I think that may be the materials we hadn't previously 
received? That folder by itself has more than 600,000 items. 
I don't want to give 
anything that we've already previously received and uploaded, and I can't tell from the 
folder or file names whether everything on the drive is new, or whether just additional materials were saved onto it 
in addition to what we already have. =, 
are you able to give us some guidance on this? Ultimately what we 
really need is a spreadsheet of every device, whether it's been dumped (or partially dumped), and then identifying 
that same info — which device, and what materials from it — are being given to us with each data transfer. Otherwise 
I think organizationally and for review purposes it will be a total disaster for us. 
We're happy to have a meeting on this if that's helpful — and thanks everybody for the assistance.

Hi everyone. One of our shared challenges in this time is nurturing the sense of community that's so important to what 
we do—that spirit of shared purpose which brings us together in good times and bad to celebrate, laugh, and reflect. 
Last week brought some very public milestones: a civil settlement that held Novartis accountable for years of illicit 
kickbacks and the arrest of Ghislaine Maxwell. 
But so much your important work is happening outside the spotlight, and I wanted to take a moment to celebrate that as 
well. So thank you to everyone who has taken on new gun cases to help combat the recent rise in violence; thank you to 
everyone handling the civil and criminal litigation around incarceration in the Covid era with thoughtfulness and 
care; [civil example]; thank you to all of our unsung AUSAs, paralegals, and staff. We miss seeing you every day, but we 
celebrate your efforts today and always. This District is lucky to have you. 
Until next time, stay safe and keep up the great work.

Everything with the exception of a couple of items are ready. I will get you an actual number before I send it over. 
We can send it over tomorrow. There will be ReadMe files included so it will be easy to see where the items came from. I 
am a little worried about how the e-mail will present. While looking through on a spot check, the attachments are not 
connected to the e-mails in the forensic tool. I believe it is a function of the e-mail client they were using to begin with. I 
know that the attachments are a concern of yours. We may have to massage things a bit to get it right. Now that we are 
working every day, and everything has been processed, it shouldn't be too big a deal. So far the export is about 350 GB. It 
copies slowly because it is a ton of pretty small files. You are getting the whole ball of wax, here, Macs, Windows boxes, 
loose media, etc. There will be a few iPhone and iPad reports, but unsure if I can get you those tomorrow as they very 
often take a LONG time to copy. Again, lots of small files. If not tomorrow, the next day. 
Are you around tomorrow? Reach out to me when you get the production so we can correct any problems we might 
encounter. Thanks.

I understand that some number of the devices are ready to come to us as early as today or tomorrow. Could you please 
let us know the following information, so we can figure out who the hard drive should go to in the first instance:

How many total devices are coming to us in this initial production? 
o What are those devices — i.e., type of device and which ones, from the spreadsheets you've sent?

You are getting both NY and USVI. The biggest stumbling block are the newer Mac items that are in APFS

I am in the process of exporting the materials (documents, spreadsheets, emails, etc) for your review as per my 
discussions with 
. Most of the NY stuff is done, just Mac items left. This might take a few days as 1 item in 
particular has over 500,000 emails. We will be able to provide discovery once Defense Council has provided 
drives for us to copy items over to. This goes quicker as there is no processing involved. I'll let you know when 
everything is complete.

please let us know when we will be able to get the materials? I expect a judge will ask us about discovery as early as this 
week. 
Also, the related critical question that I don't think we have clarity on is whether you're giving us a copy of everything that 
was collected (including reproducing the materials that you previously gave us, but which are not searchable), or have you 
and 
figured out a way to categorize the prior productions so they're useful for us? We would strongly prefer to just 
get everything at once in a usable format, but please let us know if you expect to produce materials differently than that. 
thanks,

We are going every other day now, ramping up to 75% week after next. I need drives to put things on like 
and I discussed earlier. Once I have those drives, it will take me a couple days to copy stuff. LMK when I can 
expect the drives. Thanks.

Wanted to circle back on this and check in, particularly because we desperately need to get the results from the July and 
September searches before moving forward with possible additional charges in the case. I know you had mentioned you 
needed to push back your prior estimate of complete production by early June, by a couple weeks, so wanted to see what 
the current estimate is? I don't think we've started to get anything yet but please correct me if I'm wrong.

Unfortunately, recent events and our staffing levels have conspired to put a kink in just about everything. If we 
can't make heads or tails of the stuff I've already produced, we'll do it again. They have told us that our staffing 
levels will be steadily increasing over the next few weeks, but I'm going to have to push back my estimate by a 
week or 2. Sorry about that. My next day in the office is Thursday, so I'll be able to see if I can easily identify 
what I already gave you and many it to a reliable identifier.

Thanks for this, it's a helpful start. In terms of being able to write our search warrant, one additional piece of information 
we need is the serial number, or some other specific identifier, ideally for each device but at least for any device that there 
is more than one of the same thing. So for example, we need to be able to somehow differentiate the following devices — 
The two Dell power edge T310 hard drives (NYCO24323 and NYCO24324) 
The two Sony Vaio laptop / Fujitsu hdd (NYCO24336 and NYCO24337) 
the following loose storage devices: 
o Micro SD card (NYCO24339) 
o Flash Drive (generic) (NYCO24340) 
o Thumbdrive (Emtec) (NYCO24341) 
o hard drive (loose) (NYCO24342) 
o verbatim thumbdrive (NYCO24343) 
The four San Disk cruzer-thumbdrives (NYCO24344-47) 
The three Seagate IDE hard drives (NYCO24348-50) 
The camera SD card (NYCO24351) 
I think the rest of the devices are either specifically distinguishable and/or have an S/N listed. (By comparison, the USVI 
spreadsheet we have lists an s/n for about 20 of the 25(ish) devices. 
The other thing we're looking for is the location in the house (and ideally specific location) for each device, which the USVI 
list also has — is that info available? 
The list also has just five devices as still pending to be transferred to us, and I think it's right that the plan is to reproduce 
all the materials so that we can get them in searchable format, but just wanted to confirm? Currently, we aren't able to 
match any of the prior productions to specific devices — so if we're able to match them up by Bates number now, that

in that column, that data has yet to be transferred. There are 2 Macs and a DVR you don't have as well as an

Respectfully, I think there are some miscommunications here — all we have asked is to receive the materials in a format 
such that we can view them using a system we have access to. We're not able to get web-enabled access through any FBI 
tool, so we asked for the materials to be transferred in a loadable format so we could put them on Relativity, which both 
we and the agents can access. We're required to have the files in a format that we can produce them to defense counsel. 
I've done that in many other cases and it hasn't previously been an issue. My understanding from 
is that the best 
way to do it now is just for us (the U.S. Attorney's Office) to get the original files, which our vendor will process—by which 
I just mean converting into file formats that are loadable onto Relativity. It doesn't really have anything to do with the 
taint review—we have to have access to the docs in our systems for discovery purposes. 
And we were happy to get the materials as they were processed, but when we received the 1.1 million documents earlier 
this year, they were in a format that wasn't usable for the reasons described in the email I sent on March 9. Again, I 
understand from 
that the best way forward is to just get copies of the materials in their original formats, which I 
understand will be segregated and designated by device. That should work for usl I was just trying to understand the 
approach, as well as the timeline.

Just to be clear. The US Attorney's Office (or it's contractors) are not "processing" anything. You are taking files 
that I will be extracting from processed evidence and putting them into an E-Discovery tool (Relativity) to do a 
taint review. 
Relativity is NOT a forensic tool. It is incapable of dealing with many things that are found forensically on a 
computer like free space, slack space, and system files to name a few. When we started this, and you insisted 
you do the taint review in Relativity, I warned you that it was adding months worth of work on top of what was 
already done, and that Relativity was incapable of viewing everything. You insisted we do it this way. So now 
and I have come up with a way to fit this round peg into this square hole. We will get it done. 
Sorry it has taken so long, but we are talking about terabytes worth of data over multiple forms of digital 
evidence. Phones, tablets, loose media, cameras, DVRs, servers, laptops, and desktop computers. We have 
gotten past encryption on multiple devices. When we review devices on such large cases, we usually do it piece 
by piece as things are processed, I was unaware that you didn't want to review as things were processed, that 
you wanted to do it "all at once", so that added to the delay. Sorry for that. Just a differentiation of 
methodology I suppose. 
and I feel confident that the method we have come up with will be more consistent and preserve the 
attribution of files to devices and links of e-mails to attachments that the load file generation that I did a while 
back was lacking.

Okay, so just to check, you both think that there is not a need to do a test run? You're both comfortable with just basically 
sending us copies of everything? I don't totally understand why we couldn't have done that eight months ago, but 
regardless of the passage of time, I want to make sure we understand so we can report to our supervisors. I assume that 
means that we (at the U.S. Attorney's Office and through contractors) will therefore need to do all the processing 
ourselves, correct? And thanks again to you both.

Unfortunately I don't think this is very helpful to us. Did you take a look at the example spreadsheet I sent on 2/24? The 
excel file you sent has descriptions that don't match up to the items listed in the search warrant returns (that we sent on 
2/23), and we don't have the 1B or CART numbers to be able to cross-reference. We also can't tell what you mean by 
"loose media" without a specific comparison to what was seized, we don't know which items you're referring to as 
"Windows machines," and we can't tell whether the entirety of any particular item has been transferred, or just partial. 
For example, it looks like we have gotten very, very few image files, which is surprising. 
EFTA00027012
--- PAGE 14 ---
We have also encountered some very significant problems in trying to review the more than 1 million documents we 
recently received: 
The data we've received has no way to put any emails and attachments together. So if an email says, "see the 
attached flight records," for example, we have no way of linking that up with the records themselves. Not only is 
that a big problem for us in review, it's going to be a huge problem for producing the documents to defense 
counsel. 
The load file has no link to the native file, so when we load the data to the database, there's no way to have the 
native files show up in the database. Because many of the files are too large to open in the viewer, it effectively 
means that there are many files that are completely invisible to us. 
Related, the control numbers in the load file don't match up to the native files. So we have two sets of numbers 
and no way to match up anything—that is, even if we were to try to go hunt down every individual large file in the 
native files, it would be impossible. 
So the data that we most recently got, we need to get in a form that addresses those issues, and we likely will need to get 
a similar reproduction of the data we received a couple months ago. Otherwise we're sifting through more than a million 
documents without much rhyme or reason. 
I've re-attached the spreadsheet we sent last week — I think that's a good place to start in terms of our necessary record-
keeping, and we need that info at the very least, as well as anything else you think would be useful. Also attaching the SW 
returns for reference. And again, we're happy to meet up anytime and hash all this out in person if that's useful.

Here is a listing of what I have already handed over in load files to the US Attorney's Office for taint review. Some points of 
clarification: There were 9 IDE hard drives found in the Manhattan apartment, they turned out to be 3 copies of 3 drives 
(9 drives in total) from a July 2007 search on one of his properties. I only processed 3 (as they were all copies). All the 
loose media from the NY apartment is included. All the Windows machines from the NY apartment are included. Only 2 
Macs from NY and 1 from the Island are included. 
I will have to more closely coordinate with whoever is loading up Relativity with the remaining Macs as the tool 
they have to be processed with does not easily re-name the load files.

Totally understand about the network issues—we can relate. I do still think it will be helpful to all sit down together to 
have an in-person discussion, to make sure everybody is on the same page. Are folks available for that next week? And 
what I think would be most helpful to facilitate that would be a spreadsheet of each separate device referenced in the two 
search warrant returns, with columns for whether we've dumped the contents, whether they've been reviewed and/or 
transferred, what portions were transferred, etc. 
EFTA00027014
--- PAGE 16 ---
Something roughly like the attached, with any other categories you think would be useful — and the info on the attached is 
mostly hypothetical, obviously, just as examples. That will help us fully understand what's been reviewed, transferred, 
and received so far, and what remains. 
(Also just on the pictures, we do want copies of those as well, please including from the discs and the devices — I think FBI 
was going to do an initial screen to make sure no CP, and since I think the answer was no, we'll need to get those to be 
able to review them as well.) 
many thanks,

Sony for the delayed response. They are tearing out our old network and giving us a new one, they mandated we 
delete old stuff (about 400 TB worth). Now that they are working on replacing the network, we can do only local 
work. I should be able to give you an accounting of what is what. I can say, off the top of my head, that all 
windows based items from the NY search have been handed over as well as all loose media. The CDs from NY 
only contained pictures, no documents. There are still some Apple items from NY that need to be produced. As 
far as the Island stuff goes, the 1st item on your spreadsheet, the "kitchen" mac has been produced. Still working 
on the rest.

Following up on the below from last weekend, I'm still not sure how we're addressing this so I thought it would make 
sense for us to all schedule a (hopefully relatively brief) meeting to all get on the same page? We didn't hear back on 
which files had previously been provided, but our tech folks did their best to differentiate, and we got access to the 
materials yesterday and its well over a million documents, and we don't have any idea what we're looking at — i.e., which 
devices the materials came from, whether it's full or partial results, how many more devices we have coming, etc. 
Based on the attached search warrant returns, it looks like from the New York mansion (the PDF) there are approximately 
devices that would have storage (computers, hard drives, thumb drives, etc.) and that's not even counting at least 60+ 
CDs. And then from the Virgin Islands (the Excel spreadsheet), at least more than 25 devices, including multiple servers / 
server racks. 
So we gotta know what we've already received, what remains, anticipated schedule, etc, and I know it's a lot of moving 
pieces on all sides so wanted to loop in everybody at once. The case team will be in California this coming week from 
Tuesday through Friday, but then I think generally around the first week of March, which will hopefully be plenty of time 
to schedule a productive meeting.

I'm not sure who's the exact right person to ask this, so wanted to get everybody on one email chain about it — I have the 
hard drive that 
dropped off that has new Epstein search warrant materials, but it looks like there are also old 
materials (that I think we had previously received and uploaded??) on the hard drive, and so I'm not sure what's new. 
Just generally, and 
and I talked about this last week too, but it's basically impossible for us to keep track of what 
we're getting, and what has been completed, without some kind of identification or labeling system, along with a list of 
which devices have been extracted and downloaded. 
So for example on the hard drive currently, there are 38 folders labeled "loadFiles" through "37loadFiles" with a modified 
date of 11/14/19, which I think we may have already previously received — but I'm not sure, because we haven't gotten 
any info on which folders match up to which devices, etc. And then there's another folder titled "NYC024362" that has a 
modified date of 1/27/20, so I think that may be the materials we hadn't previously received? That folder by itself has 
more than 600,000 items. 
I don't want to give 
anything that we've already previously received and uploaded, and I can't tell from the folder or 
file names whether everything on the drive is new, or whether just additional materials were saved onto it in addition to 
what we already have. =], are you able to give us some guidance on this? Ultimately what we really need is a 
spreadsheet of every device, whether it's been dumped (or partially dumped), and then identifying that same info —
which device, and what materials from it — are being given to us with each data transfer. Otherwise I think 
organizationally and for review purposes it will be a total disaster for us. 
We're happy to have a meeting on this if that's helpful — and thanks everybody for the assistance.

Yeah we actually already know what it's referring to — DB did an extremely comprehensive presentation to us, and has 
produced a large amount of documents. The transactions referenced include transfers we've described in both the 
Epstein and Maxwell filings, among others. We had them run the names of a bunch of people for transfers — see the 
attached email and its attachment — and they also did a summary chart of his accounts, also attached. And yeah it's 
Parvin, she's done a really thorough job. I share your view that despite the press coverage, there doesn't appear to have 
been any malfeasance at all in connection with the Epstein accounts.

Looks like DFS settled with Deutche Bank yesterday. The press coverage is all about Epstein and the ostensibly 
"suspicious" transactions they processed for him, but if I'm a betting man, I'm betting the bulk of the resolution is based 
on the last sentence of the article: "The fine also covered the German bank's connection to a massive money laundering 
scheme and other improper activity." 
https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/07/07/deutsche-bank-fined-150-million-relationship-with-jeffrey-
epstein-other-lapses/ 
Anyway, maybe worth seeing if you can pull the public settlement dots to see what the allegedly suspicious transactions 
entailed. Or you can go straight to the bank, I suppose. Remind me, does Parvin represent them?

According to KYC records, Jeffrey Epstein used the Now/SuperNow accounts (also referred to as "Elite Checking with Interest") for his "personal daily use." See DB-
SDNY-0002607. The attached chart reflects incoming wire transfers from Deutsche Bank brokerage accounts and accounts held at third party financial institutions. The chart 
does not capture internal cash transfers between Deutsche Bank deposit accounts. 
In early 2016, Jeffrey Epstein moved his assets from one Now/SuperNow account to a different Now/SuperNow account. We are still unclear as to why this transition 
occurred, but expect electronic communications to provide additional insight. To date, the only functional difference between the two accounts that we have identified is the 
account number, which is reflected in the "Recipient" column.

The below chart reflects the flow of money through two deposit accounts and one brokerage account belonging to "The Haze Trust." The Haze Trust Checking account 
was opened with Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas. The Haze Trust DBAGNY account was opened with Deutsche Bank's New York branch office. The latter account 
offers higher interest rates than the former. We have yet to determine how the Haze Trust Brokerage account was initially capitalized.

The Gratitude America MMDA was primarily capitalized via a $10 million deposit from BV70 LLC. Bloomberg has reported that Leon Black controls BV70 LLC. See 
Tom Metcalf, Jeffrey Epstein's Endgame: One Last Shot to Stay in Wall Street's Favor, Bloomberg (August 6, 2019), available at: 
hops:l/www.bloomberg.comtnewslarticles/2019-08.06/epstein-s-endgame-one-last-shot-to-stay-in-wall-street-s-favor. Exhibit E demonstrates how those funds were spent. 
Account statements reflect that this payment was made to "First Clearing LLC." However, wire records clarify that the payment was intended for the Bruce and Marsha 
Moskowitz Foundation. See DB-SDNY-0000478. 
Account statements reflect that his payment was made to "Morgan Stanley." However, wire records indicate that the payment was intended for an account held by

The attached is what BOP provided in response to our request for "hot lists." What do you think about producing? It 
seems to have a lot of confidential information about other inmates, and Epstein was never placed on this list. One 
possible response is just to say that Epstein was never placed on the list.

Here are a few more things from your request. I have been unable to locate any watch calls or SROs from the requested 
time frame. I will continue to look for those documents. I have been told SROs were likely not completed during that time 
and also that most of the Control Center paperwork (originals), to include watch call sheets, were seized by the FBI and/or 
OIG shortly after the incident, and therefore are no longer in the institution. 
Please let me know if you have any questions or if I can be of any further assistance.

We have attached a proposed disclosure cover letter that is modeled on a letter sent by the Government in United 
States v. Madonna, 17 Cr. 89 (CS). We have also attached proposed redacted disclosures. As you and I discussed, 
we offer this as a means to ensure our client's safety while permitting the Government to comply with what you 
believe are your disclosure obligations. 
As an alternative, we are willing to apply under seal to Judge Tones for a Protective Order to preclude the 
disclosure. Our client is not a witness, and so this is not 3500 material, nor is it Rule 16 material. We do not 
believe that this is in fact Brady material, but rather is an error made by our client that we understand is

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
Plaintiff, 
v. 
ALAN DERSHOWITZ, 
Defendant. 
ALAN DERSHOWITZ, 
Counterclaim Plaintiff, 
v. 
Counterclaim Defendant. 
Civil Action No. I :19-cv-3377 (LAP) 
PLAINTIFF'S MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF HER 
MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE AN AMENDED COMPLAINT 
Pursuant to Rule 15(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Plaintiff-
respectfully requests leave of the Court to file the attached Amended Complaint. This motion 
should be granted for three reasons. First, since Plaintiff filed her complaint in April 2019, the 
revival provision of the New York Child Victims Act has gone into effect, reviving a battery claim 
against Defendant Alan Dershowitz that had previously been time barred. N.Y.C.P.L.R. § 214-g. 
Second, since Plaintiff filed her Complaint, Defendant has produced a copy of a recording 
that he represents captures a portion of a confidential telephonic settlement conference between 
EFTA00027039
--- PAGE 2 ---
Case 1:19-cv-03377-LAP Document 100 Filed 12/20/19 Page 2 of 5 
himself and Plaintiff's attorney, David Boles.' This unauthorized recording, use, and disclosure of 
a communication made on Plaintiff's behalf for the purpose of defaming Plaintiff violates 18 
U.S.C. § 2511(1). As a "person whose wire, oral, or electronic communication" was "intercepted, 
disclosed, [and] intentionally used in violation" of that provision, Ms. 
is entitled to recover 
from Mr. Dershowitz. Id. § 2520. 
Finally, since Plaintiff filed her Complaint, Defendant's campaign of defamatory 
statements against Ms. 
has not only continued but has intensified. Each new defamatory 
statement gives rise to a new claim for defamation. Although the frequency with which Mr. 
Dershowitz defames her will prevent Ms. 
from amending her complaint every time Mr. 
Dershowitz publishes a new defamatory statement, the scope and nature of the new statements 
justify an amendment in this instance, especially given that Ms. 
is amending the complaint 
to add the other two claims. 
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15 provides that a plaintiff may amend her complaint 
"with the opposing party's written consent or the court's leave." FED. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). "The 
court should freely give leave when justice so requires." Id. 
In the absence of any apparent or declared reason—such as undue delay, bad faith 
or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies 
by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by 
virtue of allowance of the amendment, futility of amendment, etc.—the leave 
sought should, as the rules require, `be freely given.' 
Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962) (quoting FED. R. Ctv. P. 15(a)). "[A]bsent a showing 
of bad faith or undue prejudice," mere delay "does not provide a basis .. . to deny the right to 
amend." State Teachers Ret. Bd. v. Fluor Corp., 654 F.2d 843, 856 (2d Cir. 1981). Moreover, "the 
Dershowitz had previously claimed to have such a recording, but Plaintiff and her 
attorneys did not obtain access to it until after the complaint was filed. 
EFTA00027040
--- PAGE 3 ---
Case 1:19-cv-03377-LAP Document 100 Filed 12/20/19 Page 3 of 5 
party opposing the amendment bears the burden of showing prejudice, bad faith, and futility ...." 
Williams v. Epic Security Corp., 358 F. Supp. 3d 284, 294 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (quotation marks 
omitted). 
There is no reason to deny leave to amend in this instance. Defendant has no valid basis to 
allege "undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive" on Plaintiff's part: the events precipitating the 
battery and Wiretap Act claims occurred while a motion to dismiss the Complaint was pending. 
Many of the new defamatory statements occurred during the same period or even more recently. 
When it denied the motion to dismiss, the Court also disqualified Plaintiff's counsel. Her new 
counsel have worked diligently since their retainer less than two months ago to develop Plaintiff's 
new claims. 
Defendant will not be prejudiced by the amendment. The case is in its early stages, with 
parties making initial disclosures this week, and most of the factual allegations underpinning 
Plaintiff's new claims—including the truth or falsity of the new defamatory statements—depend 
on the same body of proof as the claims and counterclaims already in suit. 
Defendant has indicated that he will argue that the claims are futile. The only ground for 
futility his counsel has identified—that Plaintiff was too old at the time of the battery to invoke 
the revival statute, see Transcript of Dec. 2, 2019, Status Conference, Doc. No. 96 at 20 ("Dec. 2 
Tr.")—raises a question of fact unsuitable for resolution on a motion to amend. See, e.g., Benton 
v. Broolyield Properties Corp., 2004 WL 1335908, *6 (S.D.N.Y. June 14, 2004) (granting leave 
to amend where merits of new claim depended upon a question of fact). The statute re-opens the 
limitations period for one year beginning in August 2019 for civil actions arising from conduct 
that violated Article 130 of the Penal Code committed against the Plaintiff before the age of 18. 
N.Y.C.P.L.R. § 214-g. The proposed Amended Complaint alleges Defendant sexually assaulted 
EFTA00027041
--- PAGE 4 ---
Case 1:19-cv-03377-LAP Document 100 Filed 12/20/19 Page 4 of 5 
her prior to the age of 18. See Proposed Amended Complaint ¶¶ 38, attached as Exhibit A to the 
Declaration of Haley Proctor (Dec. 20, 2019) ("Proposed Am. Compl."). Accordingly, the battery 
claim is not futile. 
The Court independently raised the question whether Ms. 
would have "standing" 
to make a claim under the Wiretap Act. See Dec. 2 Tr. at 21. Section 2520 of Title 18 provides for 
civil relief under the Act for "any person whose wire, oral, or electronic communication is 
intercepted, disclosed, or intentionally used in violation of this chapter." 18 U.S.C. § 2520(a) 
(emphasis added). Thus, Plaintiff must have a "possessory interest" in the communication to bring 
a claim under the Act. Smoot v. United Transp. Union, 246 F.3d 633, 640 (6th Cir. 2001). Courts 
have held that statements made by an agent of the plaintiff in course of the agent's representation 
of the plaintiff are possessed by the plaintiff and thus are sufficient to confer standing to bring a 
Wiretap Act claim. E.g., id. at 640-41. In the Proposed Amended Complaint, Ms. 
has 
sufficiently alleged a possessory interest because the captured communication was a confidential 
settlement communication made by her attorney. See Proposed Am. Compl. ¶¶ 76, 117-18. 
Accordingly, the Wiretap Act claim is not futile. 
For the reasons stated above, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court grant her Motion 
for Leave To File an Amended Complaint.

good to me. Please tag all of those as junk. 
The search entitled "Epstein — Junk Search Terms (Keywords)" seems to have caught up a number of documents that are 
not junk and appear responsive to the warrant. It's not clear to me why that happened—the ones I'm seeing don't 
appear to have any of the keywords on the attached list. Is there a reason that would be? Also, I realized that this search

The SDNY requests approval for travel by AUSA

is required at this time as Ms.

The victim was a victim of Jeffrey Epstein. She will only talk to us person and it is necessary for us to get her statement 
on the record to preserve the government's right to use her at trial. 
Please approve her travel to the U.K.

All, 
Attached please find the review protocol for the image and video files from Epstein's devices. The protocol asks that all 
reviewers read the warrant and supporting affidavit, which are both attached here as well. I am also attaching a copy of 
the Maxwell indictment, which contains a photograph of Epstein and Maxwell. 
Once the USAO and FBI review teams are assembled, please let me know when would be a good time for me to have a 
call with them to talk through the review and answer any questions. 
In the first instance, we would ask that the FBI team review the following devices:

Additionally, as you are aware, the Government has seized and extracted data from 
multiple electronic devices in connection with search warrants executed at Jeffrey Epstein's 
properties in New York and the Virgin Islands. The data from those devices has been subject to a 
privilege review, based on privileges asserted by Jeffrey Epstein's estate. Because the estate has 
not waived any of those privileges, the Prosecution Team in this case will not have access to any 
materials from those devices identified as privileged by the taint review team, and the Government 
will not produce any such privileged material to the defense in this case. 
Further, it is the Government's current understanding that none of the seized devices 
belonged to the defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell, and as a result, it is the Government's 
understanding that the Prosecution Team is not legally permitted to provide you with the full set 
of non-privileged materials that were extracted from the devices. Instead, the Government 
anticipates producing only the materials designated responsive to the relevant warrants authorizing 
the search of these devices. Correspondingly, upon completion of the responsiveness review, the 
Prosecution Team will only have access to that same set of non-privileged materials deemed 
responsive to the relevant warrants. The Government expects to produce these responsive, non-
privileged materials to you by the November 9, 2020 deadline for completion of discovery.

already reviewed the initial draft I sent to the chiefs, but I wanted to make sure you all had an opportunity to 
review and comment on this before I send this back to the chiefs. I know it is quite lengthy, so apologies in advance. 
Thanks,

Heys, 
Fedex only retains records for 1 to 5 years depending on which method they use (ground...freight etc.). 
We are still waiting on an answer from Victoria Secret. Will let you know as soon as I know.

Just confirmed with 
that we'll need a replacement of the folder called "18 1-14" since it won't copy for him either, 
probably due to the files getting corrupted somehow when the disc was burned. The folder/its contents may be small 
enough that the FBI could send it via USAfx rather than having to burn a new disc, but we'll need a replacement of this 
folder either way.

Four of the five folders from the disc have successfully uploaded to the folder path linked below, but the fifth folder (18 1-
14) contains at least one file that will not copy off of the disc (not sure if the file is corrupted or what the issue is exactly). 
I'll check with the IT folks and 
to see if they're able to copy the remaining folder off the disc or if we'll need the FBI 
to recopy and resend it. I will keep you posted on the status of this last folder.

FCT0ONIC ALLY WILED 
DOC s: 
rim FILED: 4/19/2021 
20-cr-330 (AJN) 
ORDER 
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
In its April 16, 2021 Opinion, the Court denied the Defendant's motions to dismiss the S1 
superseding indictment in whole or in part and granted the Defendant's motion to sever the 
perjury counts for a separate trial. Dkt. No. 207. The Court will try the non-perjury counts first. 
As the Court noted in its Opinion, it has not yet resolved the Defendant's two motions to 
suppress evidence. See Dkt. Nos. 133, 139. The Defendant contends in those motions that the 
Government obtained by subpoena documents covered by a protective order in violation of her 
rights against unreasonable searches and seizures, against self-incrimination, and to due process 
of law. The motions seek, at minimum, an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the 
Government knowingly misrepresented facts to procure an order modifying the protective order. 
The Court requires information from the Government for scheduling purposes. 
The Government is ORDERED to inform the Court by letter docketed on ECF no later 
than April 20, 2021, whether it intends to use any of the documents subject to the pending 
motions to suppress in the trial of the non-perjury counts in this case. 
EFTA00027089
--- PAGE 2 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 216 Filed 04/19/21 Page 2 of 2 
If the Government does not intend to use any of the documents subject to the pending 
motions to suppress in the trial of the non-perjury counts, the Court will defer consideration of 
those motions until it has scheduled the trial of the perjury counts. 
SO ORDERED.

Subject: MCC Interviews - Update 
This afternoon, OIG, FBI, and the USAO-SDNY conducted voluntary interviews with the following MCC employees. The 
interviews were each about 2 hours. A high-level summary of each is below. 
Interview of M. 
M.= is an operations lieutenant at MCC, and is responsible for overseeing the operations of the prison during 
his duty shifts. 
On the morning of August 10, 2019, M. = 
arrived at 5:30 a.m. to relieve the outgoing lieutenant, 
At 6:33 a.m., M. = 
heard a radio call for medical staff at the SHU. I.= 
responded to the SHU, where he saw 
Officer = 
who said that Epstein had hung himself. 
. = 
went into Epstein's cell, and Epstein was on the 
ground, on top of two mattresses, and Officer 
was performing CPR. M. 
then started CPR until 
medical staff came. 
M.= asked Officer =where Epstein's cellmate was, and she said he left, and that he didn't have one 
overnight. M.= told Officer = 
that she knew Epstein was supposed to have a cellmate, and Officer
stuttered, then said she didn't know. 
Officer = 
admitted to I.= 
that they did not conduct the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. counts; and Officer 
said 
"we messed up" and "we didn't do the counts" and "it's not her fault." E. =was not aware the cameras were 
not working in SHU. 
Interview of E. 
has worked at the MCC since May 2019, but has a lengthy BOP career. He's the institution duty officer 
and has responsibilities relating to multiple units. Among other things, he helps inmates make telephone calls, 
EFTA00027104
--- PAGE 2 ---
including legal calls and calls from within the SHU. 
M. 
had spoken to Epstein briefly on multiple occasions. Epstein asked for assistance making a personal 
call. 
got Epstein his pin number a few days before Epstein's death, but Epstein had not activated it. 
took Epstein to the SHU showers to make the phone call. Epstein told 
he was calling his mother. 
dialed a number provided by Epstein, and 
overhead Epstein making small talk with a male 
individual. 
whose shift was over, left Epstein with two 5HU officers — Officer MI and a male officer —
and told them to return Epstein to his cell after 15 minutes. Because Epstein's pin was not activated, 
dialed the number on the MCC line for legal conversations, which is not recorded. 
was not on duty when Epstein's body was discovered. He says he was not aware that Epstein's cellmate 
had moved, and he did not know the camera system was not working. 
Interview of M. 
a 
oversees the whole prison, and all of the lieutenants of particular units (such as SHU) report to him. 
stated that on multiple occasions following Epstein's apparent attempted suicide, he spoke to the 
lieutenants that report to him about how Epstein needed a cellmate at all times. All of those commands were 
made orally. 
- 
MI 
said they were aware that 
had court, which was not out of the ordinary. No one briefed him 
on the fact that 
personal property was being collected or that he was moved. 
- 
M 
did not learn that Epstein's cellmate moved until after Epstein's apparent suicide was discovered. 
- 
MK 
was not working when the evening rounds and counts occurred. He was aware there was work 
being done on the videos but wasn't told why. 
Today, FBI and OIG agents also attempted to interview MI= 
and 
(the officers who discovered 
Epstein), but they did not agree to speak with agents and agents were unable to 
(An individual who 
the agents believe was 
answered the phone but then claimed he wasn't 
and hung up.) Agents also 
contacted four of the officers on duty on Friday August 9, 2019, but they would not speak with agents without their union 
representatives. We will continue conducting interviews over the next few days. Finally, FBI has not completed their 
analysis of the video evidence yet.

What case am I using to bring witnesses into SONY. I can only bring people in for GJ, pretrial, trial and sometimes pre G.I. 
For the last three witnesses it was pre-trial. But that was when we had an open indictment. 
If you are interviewing more people in an investigation you are going to have to travel to them. 
I am not giving anyone a hard time I just need to follow the rules.

FYI, among several other recent requests and communications, Epstein's defense counsel says below that they would 
"welcome a call" with whoever is conducting the investigation into his death and have asked us to provide you with their 
contact information. Obviously leave it entirely to you whether you believe it would be appropriate or useful for your 
investigation to be in touch with them in any capacity. 
Separately, they have asked us to advise the individuals working on the investigation into Epstein's death that his brother, 
Mark Epstein, is represented by Stacey Richman, from the Law Offices of Murray Richman. Should you find it appropriate

in light of yesterday's seizures of computers in the Virgin Islands from Mr Epstein's residence or residences, and in 
light of the fact that emails and documents contained on some or all of these computers contain attorney-client and work

seized from his NYC residence shortly thereafter. I have a list of attorneys that I am prepared to send to a taint prosecutor 
once one is identified to me. 
Second, there remains the timing of the dismissal of the charge against Mr. Epstein. Are you awaiting a motion to dismiss

Dear all, 
As 
explained, we are instituting a formal litigation hold in connection with Mr. Epstein's death at MCC. You have 
been identified as having done work on or supervised the Epstein matter, and thus as possibly having responsive records. 
Please note and preserve whatever you have about Mr. Epstein, not limited to his death and to the earlier reported 
incident in which he suffered physical injuries. In addition, to the extent possible, please avoid altering any relevant 
records. If you need to use existing documents, please save what you're working off of as a new document so that the 
version that now exists remains preserved and available.

I attach a formal litigation hold notice, which as required is on an EOUSA-provided form. Please review the notice, fill out 
the form to indicate whether and where you have responsive records, and sign and return it to me. In particular, be sure 
to let me know by USAO number if possible what records and share directories we have that are likely to include relevant 
information. 
I prefer scanned and emailed return of the forms, but you can also use interoffice mail if you prefer. 
Please let me know if you think other USAO personnel may have relevant documents or evidence. 
And please let me know if you have questions or want to discuss. 
Finally, I am copying

employed as a correctional officer.' On appeal, he challenges the sentence 
imposed by the district court following his guilty plea conviction. We affirm. 
I. FACTS & PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND 
Hernandez was employed as a correctional officer ("CO") at the Big 
Spring Correctional Center ("BSCC") in Big Spring, Texas from 1999 until 
August 2012. The facility had a Special Housing Unit ("SHU") that was used 
to house high-risk inmates under administrative detention and disciplinary 
segregation. Due to the nature of the high-risk inmates housed in the SHU, 
the COs assigned to the unit had additional duties, including documenting in 
writing that they had conducted random safety checks every 30 minutes during 
their shifts, with notations for any unusual activity or reasons if one or more 
of the rounds could not be conducted. Formal inmate counts and fire and safety 
checks of the unit were to also be conducted several times during a 12-hour 
shift and documented in writing. The COs assigned to the SHU were also 
required to sign Post Orders Quarterly Signature Sheets, which confirmed that 
they had read and understood the specific requirements for working with the 
high-risk inmates housed in the SHU. 
Inmate Luis Bent was housed in the SHU when he committed suicide in 
his cell on August 23, 2012. Prior to his death, Bent was transferred upon his 
own request to the SHU on August 21, 2012. On August 22, 2012, Bent was 
evaluated by medical personnel. According to the progress notes taken at that 
time, Bent's mental state had deteriorated significantly since his last 
evaluation a week prior on August 15, 2012. Bent's August 15th evaluation 
indicated that his sleep, mood, energy and appetite were all "good" and 
Frederick Hernandez's term of imprisonment is scheduled to be completed on August 
25, 2015. As such, Hernandez filed a motion to expedite consideration of his appeal on 
January 26, 2015. This court granted the motion on January 30, 2015.

"normal." Bent's August 22nd evaluation, which took place at 1:20 p.m. the 
day after his transfer to the SHU, indicated that he was paranoid, rambling, 
and that he had "[l]oosening of associations, poor judgment, poor insight; no 
suicidal thoughts, no homicidal thoughts[.]" (emphasis in original). Although 
the record indicates that some of the COs were generally aware of Bent's 
medical evaluation, there is nothing in the record indicating that Hernandez 
or any of other the COs reviewed the August 22nd progress notes, nor have 
they claimed to have reviewed the progress notes. 
CO Joey Rosas worked in the SHU from 8:00 p.m. to 11:45 p.m. on 
August 22, 2012. Rosas stated in subsequent investigations that he had 
expressed concerns about Bent's mental state prior to Bent's suicide. He also 
stated that he was personally told when he arrived for his August 22nd shift 
that Bent had been evaluated by medical personnel earlier that day 
(approximately 1:20 p.m.) who had determined at that time that he was 
"thrown off' but "okay." 
Hernandez also reported for his shift that day at 8:00 p.m. and was 
assigned to work in the control room while other officers were assigned to 
conduct rounds and patrol the perimeter. Hernandez stated that when he and 
the other officers arrived for their shifts, the COs from the previous shift 
informed them that Bent had been behaving strangely and acting "crazy" 
during shift change, which was several hours after his medical evaluation 
when it was reported that he was "okay." The COs were also informed that 
Bent was reportedly acting "suicidal" and holding up signs in his cell door 
which read "DEA," "death," and "help." 
CO Christopher Moore began his shift just after midnight at 12:15 a.m. 
on August 23, 2012. He stated that, while he was in the control room where 
Hernandez was assigned to work with other correctional officers, they

discussed a prior suicide attempt which had occurred earlier that month in the 
SHU. 
During the course of Hernandez's shift, he conducted a mandatory move 
of inmates from one cell to another, a procedure carried out every 21 days. 
After moving the inmates, Hernandez provided them with supplies to clean 
their cells. Lights in the SHU were turned off at 11:00 p.m. While the lights 
were off in the SHU, the COs completed their required paperwork. The 
paperwork included SHU Control Log forms initialed and submitted by 
Hernandez indicating that official inmate counts had been conducted at 12:01 
a.m., 3:00 a.m., and 5:00 a.m. Hernandez also initialed and submitted forms 
signed by the other COs assigned to that shift indicating that each required 
30-minute safety check had been conducted. 
The lights were not turned on again until Hernandez turned them on at 
5:26 a.m. on August 23, 2012. Almost immediately thereafter, Hernandez was 
notified that Bent had been found dead in his cell, hanging from a bed sheet. 
Hernandez reported the incident to the main control center, notified the 
medical department, and requested 911 emergency services. Bent was then 
transported to Scenic Mountain Hospital in Big Spring, Texas where he was 
pronounced dead. The cause of death was determined at that time to be 
suicide. 
An investigation commenced into the events prior to Bent's death, 
focusing on the 12-hour shift during which Hernandez and the other COs 
worked, beginning on August 22 and ending on August 23, 2012. Ultimately, 
Hernandez admitted to entering false information on the forms indicating that 
the official inmate counts had been conducted. He also admitted to initialing 
and submitting the falsified reports compiled and signed by the other COs 
indicating that they had conducted the mandatory 30-minute safety checks, 24 
of which were required to be performed during each 12-hour shift. In total, the

investigation revealed that not a single 30-minute safety check or formal 
inmate count was conducted during Hernandez's shift, which amounted to 
dozens of falsified log entries showing that the checks and counts had been 
performed. Hernandez and the other COs admitted that the practice of 
falsifying the forms to indicate that the safety checks and formal inmate counts 
had been conducted was a common, long-standing practice among the officers 
working in the SHU. Hernandez stated that the practice of falsifying forms 
was in part a result of staff shortages, 12-hour shifts, and the assignment of 
officers to the SHU who were not familiar with working there. Hernandez and 
the other COs connected to the incident were terminated. 
Hernandez and the other officers were charged in a 7-count indictment 
for making false statements and aiding and abetting, based on having signed 
and submitted falsified SHU Control Log forms and the falsified 30-minute 
safety check forms. Pursuant to a written plea agreement, Hernandez pled 
guilty to Count 7 of the 7-count indictment, which adjudged him guilty of 
violating 18 U.S.C. §§ 1001 & 1002—false statements and aiding and 
abetting—on account of having signed and submitted to the Department of 
Justice the falsified SHU Control Log form certifying that the mandatory 
formal inmate counts had been conducted during his shift. In accordance with 
his plea agreement, Hernandez waived his right to appeal his conviction but 
reserved the right to directly appeal "any issue arising from sentencing." The 
district court accepted the plea agreement and entered judgment in accordance 
therewith. 
The presentence investigation report ("PSR") recommended a base 
offense level of 6, with an increase to level 14 pursuant to U.S.S.G. 
§ 2B1.1(b)(15)(A) for an offense that involved "the conscious or reckless risk of 
death or serious bodily injury." A subtraction of 2 levels for acceptance of 
responsibility resulted in a total offense level of 12. Hernandez also had a

criminal history category of I. This produced an advisory guidelines range of 
to 16 months' imprisonment. 
Hernandez objected to the "conscious or reckless risk" enhancement, 
arguing that that the legal definition of "reckless" required that he consciously 
disregard a known risk and he was not aware of Bent's suicidal intent. The 
PSR Addendum maintained that Hernandez disregarded specific policies set 
forth for the care and custody of high-risk inmates housed in the SHU and 
information regarding Bent's mental state, including statements from other 
officers indicating that he was acting "crazy" and "suicidal" hours before he 
committed suicide in his cell. 
The Addendum further reasoned that 
Hernandez's "failure to perform the duties required of [his position], which 
might produce death and was reckless, resulted in the death of an inmate 
known to be a risk for suicide." 
Overruling Hernandez's objection to the enhancement and adopting the 
findings of the PSR and PSR Addendum, the district court sentenced him to 10 
months' imprisonment, stating that "it adequately address[es] the sentencing 
objectives of punishment and deterrence." Hernandez was also sentenced to 
two years of supervised release following the completion of his sentence and 
payment of a mandatory special assessment. 
Hernandez is currently serving his 10-month prison sentence and has 
filed this appeal. 
II. DISCUSSION 
It is undisputed that Hernandez preserved his challenge to the 
application of the sentencing enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1(b)(15)(A). 
On appeal, Hernandez asserts two primary arguments with respect to the 
sentencing enhancement. First, he contends that the district court erred by 
interpreting the enhancement as requiring only objective knowledge by the 
defendant of the risk of death or serious bodily injury, rather than subjective

No. 14-11080 
knowledge of the risk. Second, he argues that the district court erred in finding 
that he should have known that inmate Bent presented a risk of suicide. We 
find these arguments unpersuasive. 
A. Standard of Review 
"This court reviews the application of the sentencing guidelines de novo 
and reviews the district court's findings of fact for clear error." See United 
States v. Garcia-Guerrero, 313 F.3d 892, 895 (5th Cir. 2002) (citation omitted). 
"A factual finding is not clearly erroneous as long as it is plausible in light of 
the record as a whole." See United States v. Duncan, 191 F.3d 569, 575 (1999) 
(citation omitted). "[T]his court will uphold a sentence unless it was imposed 
in violation of law or as a result of an incorrect application of the sentencing 
guidelines or it is outside the range of the applicable guideline and is 
unreasonable." Garcia-Guerrero, 313 F.3d at 895 (citation omitted). 
B. Analysis 
The U.S. Sentencing Guidelines provide under Section 2B1.1(b)(15)(A) 
that, if the offense at issue involved "the conscious or reckless risk of death or 
seriously bodily injury," then "increase to level 14." 
See U.S.S.G. 
§ 2B1.1(b)(15)(A). Consequently, the primary issue in these proceedings is 
whether the sentencing enhancement applied by the district court required 
Hernandez to have subjective or objective knowledge of the risk of death or 
serious bodily injury. As noted by both parties, the Guidelines do not define 
"conscious or reckless risk of death or serious bodily injury," and the 
application notes do not mention the provision. Further, this court has not 
ruled on this issue before. 
Several of our sister circuits, however, have ruled on this issue. The 
majority of those circuits have held that the Government is not required to 
prove that the defendant was subjectively aware of the risk, but rather only 
that the defendant was objectively aware of the risk, i.e., that the risk "would

have been obvious to a reasonable person." See United States u. Maestas, 642 
F.3d 1315, 1321 (10th Cir. 2011) (reasoning that "recklessness is generally an 
objective standard" and that "a defendant's conduct involves a conscious risk if 
the defendant was subjectively aware" of the risk and "a defendant's conduct 
involves a reckless risk if the risk ... would have been obvious to a reasonable 
person."); United States v. Lucien, 347 F.3d 45, 56 (2nd Cir. 2003) (determining 
that the Ninth Circuit's "conclusion that a defendant does not have to 
subjectively know that his or her conduct created a serious bodily risk, is 
correct."); United States u. Johanson, 249 F.3d 848, 859 (9th Cir. 2001) ("We 
do not believe that a defendant can escape the application of the serious risk 
of injury enhancement by claiming that he was not aware that his conduct 
created a serious risk, that is, a defendant does not have to subjectively know 
that his conduct created the risk."). 
These circuits consistently reject the Eight Circuit's holding in United 
States v. McCord, Inc., which adopts the Guideline's involuntary manslaughter 
definition of "reckless" as "a situation in which the defendant was aware of the 
risk created by his conduct." 143 F.3d 1095, 1098 (8th Cir. 1998) (citation 
omitted). A primary reason behind their rejections of this definition is that it 
renders the distinction between "conscious" and "reckless" meaningless, which 
is nonsensical in light of the Section's disjunctive phrasing, i.e., "conscious or 
reckless risk." See Maestas, 642 F.3d at 1321; Johanson, 249 F.3d at 858; 
Lucien, 347 F.3d at 56. 
The facts of this case, however, do not require that we decide today 
whether the enhancement applied by the district court required that 
Hernandez have subjective as opposed to objective knowledge of the risk of 
death or serious bodily injury. The PSR and PSR Addendum, the remainder 
of the record, and Hernandez's own admissions indicate that he was 
subjectively aware of the risk of death or serious bodily injury. Specifically,

Hernandez conceded that when he and the other COs reported to begin their 
8:00 p.m. shifts, they were told by the officers on the prior shift that Bent was 
acting "crazy" and "suicidal" and had been holding up signs in his cell door that 
read "death" and "help." 
On appeal, Hernandez points to the medical evaluation notes taken by 
prison medical personnel the day prior to Bent's suicide. These progress notes, 
however, have no bearing on Hernandez's subjective knowledge of the risk of 
suicide presented by Bent when he falsified the reports for his 12-hour shift on 
August 22nd through 23rd. According to the record, it was Rosas—not 
Hernandez—who had discussed Bent's afternoon medical evaluation with the 
officers from the previous shift and who was reportedly told that Bent was 
"thrown off' but "okay." However, even if Hernandez was made aware of 
Rosas's conversation with the other officers, that information is negated by the 
fact that COs working during the afternoon of the 1:20 p.m. evaluation 
reported to Hernandez that Bent was acting "crazy" during shift change, 
several hours after the evaluation. Further, there is no evidence in the record 
that Hernandez reviewed Bent's medical progress notes at any point or knew 
of their content prior to Bent's suicide, nor does Hernandez advance this 
argument on appeal. Further, as pointed out by the Government, it seems 
somewhat unlikely that officers who were unwilling to perform even one single 
mandatory duty involving safety checks and formal inmate counts would have 
taken the time to conduct an elective review of an inmate's medical progress 
notes. Additionally, Moore stated that the COs working in the control room 
that night after shift change (which included Hernandez) discussed a previous 
suicide attempt which took place in the SHU earlier that month, after being 
told of Bent's "crazy" and "suicidal" behavior by the officer's from the previous 
shift.

Page 10 of 12 PagelD 431 
No. 14-11080 
In sum, according to Hernandez's own admissions and the evidence in 
the record, we conclude that Hernandez had subjective knowledge—less than 
ten hours prior to Bent's death—that Bent presented a suicide risk. 
Hernandez was told that Bent was acting "suicidal," holding up signs that said 
"help" and "death," and had been moved to the SHU for high-risk inmates at 
his own request. Hernandez was present in the control room when several COs 
had a conversation about a previous suicide attempt by an inmate in the KW 
earlier that month. Hernandez does not claim to have reviewed Bent's medical 
records or to have had personal knowledge that Bent was reported to have been 
"okay" after his medical evaluation earlier that day. Regardless, even if 
Hernandez did have personal knowledge of Bent's medical evaluation, that 
information was negated by the statements made by the officers who were 
working after Bent's medical evaluation who reported him as acting "crazy" 
several hours later during the shift change. These facts dearly show that 
Hernandez was made aware, almost immediately upon beginning his shift, 
that Bent presented a suicide risk. 
Based on this evidence, the district court made a factual determination 
that Hernandez consciously or recklessly disregarded the risk of death or 
serious bodily injury when he falsified the reports indicating that the safety 
checks and counts had been performed when they had not. Moreover, even if 
it was not feasible for Hernandez to conduct every single count or safety check, 
his decision to decline to conduct even one single check or count during the 
entire 12-hour shift, in light of the information he conceded he knew about 
Bent's erratic behavior, supports the district court's factual determination that 
Hernandez consciously or recklessly disregarded the risk. Accordingly, the 
district court's conclusion that Hernandez's offenses under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1001 
& 1002 involved "the conscious or reckless risk of death or serious bodily 
injury" was "plausible in light of the record as a whole." See Duncan, 191 F.3d

at 575 (citation omitted). Consequently, we hold that the district court's 
application of the sentencing enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 
2B.1(b)(15)(A) was not in error. Id. (citation omitted). 
III. CONCLUSION 
In light of the foregoing, the sentence of Defendant Frederick Hernandez 
is affirmed.

INDICTMENT 
The Grand Jury Charges: 
INTRODUCTION 
At all times pertinent to this Indictment: 
1. 
The Big Spring Correctional Center (BSCC) is a correctional facility under 
contract with the GEO Group, Inc., under the jurisdiction of an agency of the United States, 
the United States Department of Justice, in which persons are held in custody by direction 
of and pursuant to a contract with the head of a Federal agency, the United States 
Department of Justice. 
2. 
The BSCC consists of four correctional units, including the Flight Line 
Unit, managed under contract by the GEO Group, Inc., under the jurisdiction of an agency 
of the United States, the Bureau of Prisons (BOP). 
3. 
The Flight Line Unit at the BSCC provides contract housing services for 
approximately 1,500 federal inmates. The Flight Line Unit is equipped with a Special 
Indictment (Frederick Hernandez, Joey Rotas, and Christopher Moore) - Page 1

Case 1:14-cr-00018-O-BL Document 1 Filed 03/12/14 Page 2 of 17 PagelD 2 
Housing Unit (SHU) for inmates requiring special supervision. The SHU consists of four 
cell block ranges: the 500, 600, 700 and 800 ranges, totaling 130 double occupancy 
individual inmate cells. 
4. 
Correctional Officers assigned to the Flight Line Unit SHU are required to 
conduct and document random (irregular) 30-minute checks of each inmate cell. 
5. 
Correctional Officers assigned to the Flight Line Unit SHU are also required 
to conduct and document formal counts of inmates, said counts conducted at specific times 
of the day, evening and morning watches. There are six formal counts during each 
24-hour period: 12:01 a.m., 3:00 a.m., 5:00 a.m., 10:00 a.m., 4:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m. 
The 4:00 p.m. count is a mandatory stand-up count. 
6. 
On or about August 22, 2012, and continuing to on or about August 23, 2012, 
defendants Frederick Hernandez (Hernandez), Joe Rosas (Rosas), and Christopher 
Moore (Moore) were Correctional Officers assigned to the Flight Line Unit SHU from 
8:00 p.m., on August 22, 2012, until 8:00 a.m., on August 23, 2012. Hernandez was the 
supervising officer overseeing the Flight Line Unit SHU for this Shift (hereinafter referred 
to as the August 22 - August 23 Shift).

Re: 
United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 (RMB) 
Dear Judge Berman: 
As the Court is aware, on about the morning of August 10, 2019, Jeffrey Epstein died while 
in custody at the Metropolitan Correctional Center. On August [ ], the Office of the New York 
City Medical Examiner issued its report concluding that the defendant's cause of death was 
suicide. In light of the death of the defendant prior to a conviction becoming final, the Government 
must request the Court approve the attached proposed order of nolle prosequi. 
Consistent with our practice throughout this case and our obligations under the Crime 
Victims' Rights Act, the Government has made efforts to contact all identified victims since 
learning of the death of the defendant and will similarly notify all known victims of the attached 
order, once entered. As this Office has previously stated publicly, it remains committed to doing 
its utmost to stand up for the victims who have already come forward, as well as for the many 
others who have yet to do so.

Dear Judge Nathan, 
The Government writes in response to the Court's April 19, 2021 scheduling Order, which directed the Government to

• Victim-1, Victim-3, Victim-4, and their respective counsel will not be attending the conference. 
• Victim-2 plans to attend the conference by phone. Her counsel have asked whether she should dial into the public 
access line, or whether the Court will provide a separate access line for victims. 
• Victim-2's attorneys, David Boies and Sigrid McCawley, plan to attend the conference in person.

Re: United States v. Ghisiaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
Response to Dkt. No. 227, Government's April 21.2021 Letter re Ms. Maxwell's 
Motions to Suppress 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
We write in response to the government's letter about Ms. Maxwell's pending motions 
to suppress and request for evidentiary hearing (Dkt. No. 227), and this Court's order stating 
an intent to defer resolution of those motions and that request until after the trial on the non-
perjury counts (Dkt. No. 231). Although we appreciate the need to streamline the pretrial 
process and the desire to efficiently resolve the pending disputes, we do not agree that the 
government's letter provides an adequate basis to defer resolution of Ms. Maxwell's motions. 
We understand the Court's desire to maintain the status quo relating to the defense motions, 
but the government's response gives Ms. Maxwell no confidence that the government shares 
this understanding. Indeed, the government's vague assurances are insufficient to safeguard 
Ms. Maxwell's constitutional rights, to guarantee the government will not benefit from its 
unconstitutional conduct, and to ensure that Ms. Maxwell's is not deprived of due process 
through the introduction and use of evidence that itself was obtained in violation of due 
process.

Page 2 
The government says that this Court need not resolve Ms. Maxwell's motions to 
suppress or hold an evidentiary hearing before the trial on the non-perjury counts because it 
"does not intend to use these materials"—i.e., any of the materials subject to the suppression 
motions—"in its case-in-chief at the trial of the non-perjury counts in this case." (Dkt. No. 
227, p I). At the same time, the government purports to "reserve[] its right to use relevant 
materials from this set for any purpose permissible under the Rules of Evidence." Id. at 2. The 
government's representation is not good enough, and its reservation of rights is misplaced. 
It is not enough for the government to represent that it "does not intend to use [the 
suppression] materials in its case-in-chief at the trial of the non-perjury counts in this case." 
Id. at 1. That's because Ms. Maxwell's motions to suppress allege violations of the due 
process clause, the Fourth Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, and the Second Circuit's 
decision in Martindell v. International Tel. & Tel. Corp., 594 F.2d 291 (2d Cir. 1979). If this 
Court agrees with Ms. Maxwell's arguments, not only will it suppress all 90,000-some pages 
of material the government improperly obtained through its ex pane subpoena, it will also 
suppress all evidence derived therefrom. See Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 488 
(1963); United States v. Bailey, 743 F.3d 322, 341-42 (2d Cir. 2014). 
The government thus cannot avoid inquiry into its conduct simply by pledging not to 
use the material itself in its case-in-chief. If Ms. Maxwell is right—and an evidentiary hearing 
will show that she is—the government also cannot use any evidence it obtained "by 
exploitation of the illegality." See Wong Sun, 371 U.S. at 488. 
What's more, "the burden of proof on [an] attenuation claim is on the government." 
United States v. Ghailani, 743 F. Supp. 2d 242, 259 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (ordering an evidentiary 
hearing to put the government to its burden of proving attenuation) (citing United States v. 
EFTA00027170
--- PAGE 3 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 234 Filed 04/22/21 Page 3 of 5

Page 3 
()guns, 921 F.2d 442, 447 (2d Cir. 1990) ("The government bears the burden of proving that 
the taint [of an illegal search] has been alleviated.")). Like a Kastigar hearing, "the 
government bears `the heavy burden of proving that all of the evidence it proposes to use was 
derived from legitimate independent sources." See United States v. Allen, 864 F.3d 63, 91 (2d 
Cir. 2017) (quoting Kastigar v. United States, 406 U.S. 441, 453, 461-62 (1972) (holding that 
use and derivative use immunity provides protection "from the use of compelled testimony, as 
well as evidence derived directly and indirectly therefrom," and reversing conviction for Fifth 
Amendment violation)). "[C]onclusory denials [of taint] are insufficient as a matter of law to 
sustain the prosecution's burden of proof." Id. at 94. 
The government's April 21 letter, with its vague and conclusory assurances, thus 
offers no reason to postpone consideration of Ms. Maxwell's motions to suppress. 
The government's purported reservation of rights is also without merit. Initially, it is 
not at all clear what the government means when it says it might "use relevant materials from 
this set for any purpose permissible under the Rules of Evidence." (Dkt. No. 227, p 2). But if 
the government means that it intends to use the suppression material for impeachment 
purposes, that is all the more reason to hold an evidentiary hearing now and to resolve Ms. 
Maxwell's motions before trial on the non-perjury counts. 
There are at least two reasons why. First, while the constitution in certain 
circumstances allows the government to use unconstitutionally-obtained evidence for 
impeachment purposes, e.g., Harris v. New York, 401 U.S. 222, 223-24 (1971) (statements 
secured in violation of Miranda are admissible for impeachment purposes if voluntary), the 
constitution forbids admission of evidence for all purposes if the government's conduct 
violated due process, e.g., New Jersey v. Portash, 440 U.S. 450, 459 (1979) (due process 
EFTA00027171
--- PAGE 4 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 234 Filed 04/22/21 Page 4 of 5 
The Hon. Alison J. Nathan 
April 22, 2021 
Page 4 
forbids the state from compelling incriminating statements from a defendant and "any 
criminal trial use against a defendant of his involuntary statement is a denial of due process of 
law" (emphasis in original) (quoting Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U.S. 385, 398 (1978)). Here, the 
government violated due process when it misrepresented and misled Chief Judge McMahon in 
an ex pane proceeding to circumvent the civil protective order, and it independently would 
violate due process for the government to be allowed to use that evidence at all, for any 
purpose. U.S. CONST. amend. V; United States v. Iambus, 897 F.3d 368, 386 (2d Cir. 2018) 
("It is within the court's inherent authority to suppress evidence gathered unlawfully in order 
to maintain the integrity of its own proceedings...."). 
Second, unless Ms. Maxwell knows what evidence the government can use against 
her, under what circumstances, and for what purpose, she cannot make a knowing and 
voluntary decision about whether to testify and or to assert her right to remain silent. U.S. 
CONST. amends. V, VI; Rock v. Arkansas, 483 U.S. 44, 51 (constitution guarantees a 
defendant the right to testify in her defense); Brown v. Artuz, 124 F.3d 73, 78 (2d Cir. 1997) 
(wavier of the right to testify must be knowing and voluntary). Ms. Maxwell's decision 
whether to testify is personal and fundamental. Id. ("[T]he decision whether to testify belongs 
to the defendant and may not be made for [her] by defense counsel."). And for their part, 
counsel cannot effectively represent Ms. Maxwell and advise her regarding the exercise of her 
right to testify unless they too know the legal ramification of testifying or remaining silent. Id. 
at 79 (defense counsel must "advise the defendant about the benefits and hazards of testifying 
and of not testifying"). These considerations necessitate resolution of Ms. Maxwell's motions 
to suppress before the trial on the non-perjury counts.

For these reasons, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that this Court hold an 
evidentiary hearing on her motions to suppress and that it rule on the merits of her arguments 
before the trial on the non-penury counts.

As discussed, please feel free to have 
call me to discuss what briefing materials he needs. 
It is our preference that you guys, where possible, not draft briefing materials yourselves. 
Attached is the latest draft of the timeline we put together, which gives an overview of the relevant events. 
I am also attaching a timeline we put together of the video review and internet search history. a, 
it would be very 
helpful to fill in as much detail as possible on the video review including what direction they are walking (using the maps). 
If you want to write the notes out we can add them into the spreadsheet. 
will be in all weekend so feel free to 
give us a call with any questions.

There's a lot of information in this case and I think we are all getting swamped. I know we are trying to review and retain 
all the info while also doing the enforcement and investigative steps. Our boss said you guys did a pretty comprehensive 
power point? Would you guys mind providing that or anything you guys prepared to keep track of the case, I know it 
would help me out a little, I feel like I'm drowning in information. Apologies.

As you may know IG 
was a prosecutor in the SDNY and I believe he wants to know if the BOP disregarded 
requests, directives or court orders from the prosecutors or Judge in the SONY on the underlying case as it related to 
phone use. 
I believe HQ wants to know if the SDNY prosecutors office or Judge had any additional requirements, requests, directives 
or court orders that the BOP needed to comply with that are above standard BOP policy for his phone use. Such as 
specific recording of phone calls made, reporting to the SDNY of when phone calls were made, to whom, discussion 
topics, observing or monitoring phone calls, writing memorandums of what they BOP staff may of heard.

I just received clarification on the question that OIG HQ has regarding the underlying case. The question and

• 
In addition to BOP policies, did SDNY have requirements to memorialize Epstein's phone calls related to the 
underlying case? If so, were they followed? 
• 
Did BOP need to take notes on the conversation (since it's not recorded) or were they just required to keep a

Re: 
United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 (RMB) 
Dear Mr. Weinberg: 
The Government writes in response to your letters dated July 26, 2019, requesting 
preservation and production of seven general categories of documents (the "July Letter"), and 
August 1, 2019, requesting preservation and production in connection with a particular individual 
(the "August Letter") (collectively, the "Letters"). 
Without conceding any obligation to preserve any of the categories of documents identified 
in the Letters (let alone any obligation to produce responsive documents to the extent any exist), 
we will take reasonable steps to ensure the preservation of any documents we believe may be 
responsive to the various categories identified in the Letters to the extent such documents are 
already within the possession, custody, or control of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern 
District of New York (this "Office"). Other than documents within the possession, custody, or 
control of this Office, we will not be requesting or directing that any other office or agency, local, 
state, federal, or foreign, including any other office or component of the U.S. Department of 
Justice, or any other nonparty to this case, including but not limited to victims or their counsel 
(collectively, and without limitation, the "Non-Party Entities and Individuals"), to institute such 
preservation. Such agencies, departments, entities, and individuals are not parties to this litigation, 
are not a part of the prosecution team as that term has been defined under well-established Second 
Circuit law, and are beyond the scope of this Office's disclosure obligations in this case.' 
We note, in this respect, that your Letters purport to require this Office to direct, without 
limitation, preservation and/or production of documents by all 93 U.S. Attorney's Offices across 
the nation; an individual prosecutor at another U.S. Attorney's Office; every component of "Main 
Justice" as you use that term, including the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, the Criminal 
Division, and the Department of Justice Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section; the Securities 
EFTA00027234
--- PAGE 2 ---
We expect to take all necessary steps to comply with our obligations under Federal Rules 
of Criminal Procedure 16 and 26.2, Brady v. Maryland and its progeny, and 18 U.S.C. § 3500 
(collectively, this Office's "Production Obligations"). If you have a specific request to make to 
pursuant to Rules 16 or 26.2, Brady, or § 3500, we will address it appropriately. 
With respect to the specific requests in the Letters, we note at the outset that a number of 
them call for material that falls well beyond the scope of Rule 16 or any recognized obligation 
under Brady and its progeny. We further note that many of these requests—which purport to 
extend, without temporal limitation, to wide categories of documents that do not involve this 
Office and thus are unlikely to be within the possession, custody or control of this Office—appear 
to constitute nothing more than general fishing expeditions, which are patently beyond the scope 
of the Government's Production Obligations. We note that for purposes of discovery demands, "a 
`defendant must make a prima facie showing of materiality, and must offer more than the 
conclusory allegation that the requested evidence is material.' United States v. Abdalla, 317 
F.Supp.3d 786, 790 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (quoting United States v. Urena, 989 F.Supp.2d 253, 261 
(S.D.N.Y. 2013)). Notably, "if the purported defense for which a defendant seeks to compel the 
production of certain documents is meritless as a matter of law, then the requested documents are 
not `material' for purposes of Rule 16." Id. at 791. 
Regarding the specific requests the July Letter does contain, we respond as follows: 
First Request: 
Any investigatory files provided to the United States Attorney's Office for the 
Southern District of New York (or FBI agents working therewith) by the United 
States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida, the Middle District 
of Florida, and/or the Northern District of Georgia (or FBI agents working 
therewith). 
To the extent such materials are within the care, custody and control of the Office and fall 
within the scope of our Production Obligations, we will produce such materials consistent with 
any schedule agreed upon by the parties or set by the Court. 
Second Request: Any investigatory files that were received or accessed by the United States 
Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York (or FBI agents working 
therewith) that were sent or disclosed by or originated with the United States 
Attorney's Offices of the Southern District of Florida, the Middle District of 
Florida, and/or the Northern District of Georgia (or FBI agents working 
therewith). 
and Exchange Commission; the Department of Homeland Security; the New York [City] Police 
Department; the Manhattan District Attorney's Office; the State Attorney's Office for the 15th 
Judicial District in and for Palm Beach County; the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office; the New 
Mexico Attorney General's Office; and any other "local, state, or foreign law enforcement entities 
involved in any way in regulating or investigating the activities alleged in the Indictment or related 
transactions." July Letter at 2-3. Not only is such a request patently overbroad, but we also reject 
your assertion, for which you cite no authority, that this Office has "the legal right or practical 
ability obtain" material from these dozens of non-party entities and individuals. 
EFTA00027235
--- PAGE 3 ---
To the extent such materials are within the care, custody and control of the Office and fall 
within the scope of our Production Obligations, we will produce such materials consistent with 
any schedule agreed upon by the parties or set by the Court. We note that certain materials 
responsive to this request already have been produced as part of the Government's initial discovery 
production to the defendant on July 31, 2019. 
Third Request: 
Communications regarding Mr. Epstein between and among "Main Justice" 
(including the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section) and the United States 
Attorney's Offices for the Southern District of Florida, Middle District of 
Florida, Northern District of Georgia, and the Southern District of New York. 
To the extent such materials are within the care, custody and control of this Office and fall 
within the scope of our Production Obligations, we will produce such materials consistent with 
any schedule agreed upon by the parties or set by the Court. However, we note that this request, 
on its face, calls for large volumes of documents that are not within the possession, custody or 
control of this Office, nor relevant (let alone "material") to any potentially meritorious defense. 
We further note that we are not aware of any authority for the proposition that internal 
communications within the Department of Justice fall within the scope of Rule 16 or any other 
recognized Production Obligation. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(2) (noting that Rule 16 does not 
authorize the discovery or inspection of internal government documents made by an attorney for 
the government or other government agent in connection with investigating or prosecuting the 
case); see also United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 463 (1996) ("[U]nder Rule 16(a)(2), [a 
defendant] may not examine Government work product in connection with his case."). 
Fourth Request•. 
Any decision to initiate (or not initiate) criminal proceedings against Mr. 
Epstein. 
We are not aware of any authority for the proposition that internal communications within 
the Department of Justice, including communications about the "decision to initiate (or not initiate) 
criminal proceedings" fall within the scope of Rule 16 or any other recognized Production 
Obligations. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(2) (noting that Rule 16 does not authorize the discovery 
or inspection of internal government documents made by an attorney for the government or other 
government agent in connection with investigating or prosecuting the case); see also Armstrong, 
517 U.S. at 463 ("[U]nder Rule 16(a)(2), [a defendant] may not examine Government work 
product in connection with his case."). 
Accordingly, we will not produce any such 
communications in the care, custody, or control of this Office that are not subject to our Production 
Obligations. 
Fifth Request: 
The NPA, including but not limited to communications within the Department 
of Justice, with counsel for Mr. Epstein, with representatives of the United 
States Attorney's offices for the Southern and Middle District of Florida or the 
Northern District of Georgia and/or counsel for the alleged victims. 
To the extent such materials are within the care, custody and control of this Office and fall 
within the scope of our Production Obligations, we will produce such materials consistent with 
any schedule agreed upon by the parties or set by the Court. We note that we believe you to already 
have access to the NPA itself as well as any "communications . . with counsel for Mr. Epstein" 
EFTA00027236
--- PAGE 4 ---
regarding the same, to the extent such materials are called for by this request. We further note that 
we are not aware of any authority for the proposition that internal communications within the 
Department of Justice fall within the scope of Rule 16 or any other recognized Production 
Obligations. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(2) (noting that Rule 16 does not authorize the discovery 
or inspection of internal government documents made by an attorney for the government or other 
government agent in connection with investigating or prosecuting the case); see also Armstrong, 
517 U.S. at 463 ("[U]nder Rule 16(a)(2), [a defendant] may not examine Government work 
product in connection with his case."). 
Accordingly, we will not produce any such 
communications in the care, custody, or control of this Office that are not subject to our Production 
Obligations. Similarly, to the extent communications with counsel for any victim/witness fall 
within the Government's Production Obligations, those will be produced substantially closer to 
trial and consistent with any schedule for the production of 3500 material agreed upon by the 
parties or set by the Court. 
Sixth Request: 
Communications with alleged victims (or their counsel), including but not 
limited to consultations conducted in relation to the government's response to 
the court's summary judgment order and proposed remedies in Jane Doe v. 
United States, No. 08-cv-80736 (S.D.FI.). 
To the extent such materials are within the care, custody and control of this Office and fall 
within the scope of our Production Obligations, we will produce such materials consistent with 
any schedule agreed upon by the parties or set by the Court. In particular, as noted above, to the 
extent this Office has had communications with any alleged victims or their counsel that constitute 
3500 and/or Giglio material, such material will be produced substantially closer to trial and 
consistent with any schedule agreed upon by the parties or set by the Court. 
However, we note that on its face, this request purports to call for the production of material 
that is not within the possession, custody or control of this Office which is not a party to the 
litigation ofJane Doe v. United States, No. 08-cv-80736 (S.D. FL), nor relevant to the prosecution 
of this matter. 
Seventh Request: Information provided by alleged victims (or their counsel) related to Mr. 
Epstein prior to the return of the above-captioned Indictment. 
To the extent such materials are within the care, custody and control of this Office and fall 
within the scope of our Production Obligations, we will produce such materials consistent with 
any schedule agreed upon by the parties or set by the Court. We note, in this respect, that by letter 
dated July 31, 2019, this Office has already made an initial production of certain information 
responsive to this request. To the extent this request calls for materials covered by Section 3500 
and/or Giglio, we will produce such material substantially closer to trial and pursuant to any 
scheduled agreed upon by the parties or set by the Court. 
.Finally, regarding the specific requests contained in the August Letter, all of which relate 
to a particular employee of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida, to the 
extent such materials are within the care, custody and control of this Office and fall within the 
scope of our Production Obligations, we will produce such materials consistent with any schedule 
agreed upon by the parties or set by the Court. However, we note that on their face, these 
EFTA00027237
--- PAGE 5 ---
supplemental requests call for materials—including communications—to which this Office was 
not a party and involving an individual who is not now and has never been a member of this Office 
or the prosecution team in this matter. We further note that to the extent these requests call for 
internal documents or communications involving one or more employees of the U.S. Attorney's 
Office for the Southern District of Florida, we are not aware of any authority for the proposition 
that internal communications within the Department of Justice fall within the scope of Rule 16 or 
any other recognized Production Obligations. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(2) (noting that Rule 16 
does not authorize the discovery or inspection of internal government documents made by an 
attorney for the government or other government agent in connection with investigating or 
prosecuting the case); see also Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 463 ("[U]nder Rule I 6(a)(2), [a defendant] 
may not examine Government work product in connection with his case.").

Check out pages 38-39 of his state plea: 
Epstein counsel: "[T]here is a nonprosecution agreement with the United States Attorney's office that triggers as a result 
of this plea agreement. In other words, they have signed off and said they will not prosecute Mr. Epstein in the Southern 
District of Florida for any offense upon his successful taking of his plea today. That is a confidential document that the 
parties have agreed to. Just in an abundance of caution, I wanted to tell the court." 
The Court: "Mr. Epstein, your attorney has told me that in addition to everything, we talked about another inducement, 
shall we say, to your taking this plea is that the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of the State of Florida, federal 
prosecutor, has agreed to a nonprosecution agreement with you, meaning that if you successfully complete probation and 
do everything you're supposed to, they have, have agreed not to prosecute you federally, did you understand that?" 
The Defendant: "Yes, ma'am." 
The prosecutor then notes that SDFL people ("they") were in court for the plea.

Jeff, 
The reference to not seeking a response from Governor Richardson at this time about current allegations is correct, and I 
believe accurately conveys what I said on the phone. What I think remains inaccurate is the statement that I said he was 
neither a target, subject, or witness in the case — in response to your question about his status, what I said was that in the 
general sense, anyone who we don't have reason to know has no exposure (witness), or believe does have exposure 
(target), would be a subject, and that specifically with respect to Governor Richardson, we do not currently intend to 
subpoena or request to speak with him based on our investigation at this time. That's directly from my contemporaneous 
notes. I think you could reasonably infer from my description that we don't currently consider him a witness or target, 
but I don't think it's accurate to infer or interpret from my description on Sunday of the three categories that Governor 
Richardson is in none of them. If you had asked me to specifically place Governor Richardson in one of those categories, 
separate from a general description, I would have, and if that would be useful now, I can; similarly, if it would be useful for 
me to give you our specific view on just whether he is currently a target, I can do that. 
With respect to the quote, I don't have a view on anyone expressing their own personal inferences, and I recognize the 
revision that limits the view to this particular moment in the investigation; that said, I expect that if asked whether the 
Office in fact does believe at this time that the Governor did not participate in or witness the alleged criminal activity by 
Jeffrey Epstein, we likely would simply say that the investigation is ongoing and we are pursuing all possible leads. 
I hope this is useful. 
thanks,

Governor Bill Richardson offered his assistance in the Jeffrey Epstein investigation through his lawyer, Jeff 
Brown of Dechert LLP, to the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York. In response to this offer, Mr. 
Brown was informed by the Assistant US Attorney responsible for the case that Governor Richardson is neither 
a target, subject, nor witness in the case and that there is no allegation against Governor Richardson about 
which the government is seeking a response from Gov. Richardson at this time. 
"It's fair to conclude that the federal prosecutors investigating this matter do not believe at this time the 
Governor participated in or witnessed the criminal activity Jeffrey Epstein is alleged to have committed," said 
Mr. Brown. 
Furthermore, Governor Richardson has never been contacted by any party to a lawsuit involving Epstein, nor 
by any law enforcement investigating Epstein. Governor Richardson hopes that the investigation continues so 
that Epstein's victims can finally have their day in court and see the justice they deserve.

Good morning, M„ 
I wanted to share the following email with you. 
is a former BOP employee who now works as a kind of 
prison consultant, and he occasionally emails me with ideas about reforms for and problems at BOP. He is following the 
Epstein matter closely (through news reports) and he sent me the following email, in which he represents that he has 
suggested many detailed investigative steps to Representative Nadler's staff. I am sharing this with you purely in the 
EFTA00027247

chance that it is helpful as you think through your own investigative steps. Whether any, all, or none of these actions is 
useful is a decision I leave entirely to you and your colleagues on the investigation. 
I am also copying 
Best, 
for her awareness and 
because of the possibility that Nadler's staff will reach out to him. 
From: MI Mail [mailto: 
Sent: Sunday, August 18, 2019 8:29 AM 
To: 
Subject: Hi Mr. LavinsIcy 
I sent this to Mr. Nadler's people but I thought it would be equally beneficial to your people to connect dots. 
" Hi Perry, as a follow up to my email the other day, I forgot to tell you that I operate mostly out of NY so I am 
also constituent o The Congressman. 
As far as transparency, I would like to start with I am an Independent, not a BOP hater and feel both parties 
have not even a basic understanding of our Federal prison system policy, nuances or culture. This lack of 
understanding in combination with the lack of transparency and accountability is why things like the Epstein 
suicide and subsequent media frenzy occur: 
Below are some more targeted things I would ask for which I did not see in Mr. Nadler's request: 
I) The specific Annual Training Outline at NYM. This will include the suicide prevention training . They 
usually take theirs from a general outline submitted by the DC Correctional Programs Department but they 
have the liberty to modify and add to it. There should be one PowerPoint for the entire country. 
2) You would also want the sign in sheet for the training which includes the staff members name 
and signature for the exact day they attended. 
3) The individual regular (PP64) Intake and written Psychological Intake screening forms that Mr. Epstein 
completed! This info is transferred over after a physical interview to the PDS/BEMR system. 
4) ALL PDS (Psychology Data System) and ALL BEMR(Bureau Electronic Medial Records). PDS is now 
incorporated into BEMR but I would be clear you want both. That would include the post-suicide watch 
report and all daily clinical contacts if they were properly documenting . This would also include the 30 
day SHU review form which are sometimes cut and pasted without thought but I would imagine his would be 
actual and specific to his situation. The NYM psychology department actually has a fairly good reputation. 
5) They have should have completed a CIM Packet for Broad Publicity BP-339 form! 
6) The Unit Team should have classification related forms regarding an initial classification and subsequent 
program reviews. (See the pre-trial policy) 
EFTA00027248
--- PAGE 3 ---
7) Someone from the unit team should have been making daily rounds which would be documented not only 
the BP-292 forms (Special Housing Record & BP-295) but make sure you check the Unit Officers entrance 
log bookto compare signatures, etc. 
8) When it comes to log books, when I use to do suicide watch, they had a green government log book to 
notate every 15 minutes plus people visiting the inmate would sign the book. Later in my career, most places 
converted to a separate, blue individual log for the person watching, plus the green log book noting the 
checks. This book was like the ones issues when we took tests in college. White paper, just 10 or so pages and 
the book retired after watch for inclusion with the re-Construction. 
9) You would like to see if they did the "mock suicide" exercises per the policy and review their 
institution annual Operation Review for Psychology and most recent Program Review from DC. (every 2 to 
years depending on previous review rating) 
10) The suicide watch post orders for the officers and if the watch people signed the post orders. 
11) Copy of the list of the actual inmate companions for the training and if the training was done. 
12) SENTRY Transaction PP37, QTR which shows every single quarters change since he arrived. 
13) SENTRY ( I forget transaction #) which lists ALL assignments (inmate " Assignment History Report") 
14) ALL "Administrative Detention Orders" - For instance, pre-trial inmates can sing themselves in for 
PC Or 
Staff can admit them for "staff perception" of a threat. If it's staff perception, he can context and request a 
hearing in front of the DHO per policy. 
15) Copies of ALL data on the "SHU Program" which is a separate data base than SENTRY as well as copies 
of the weekly SHU Review roster in the possession of Correctional Services. 
There's actually more but I thought these would be helpful in your investigation. 
These and other BOP issues need more micro management by the Deputy AG, in my humble opinion. They 
have been void of seasoned leadership for a long time. This quasi-militaristic organization could be changed 
rather quickly and I was disappointed that General Inch was undermined. If you have hearings, someone 
should debrief him on why he bailed so quick. 
The answer to Federal Prison Reform is not the First Step Act or some Second Step legislation. We first 
need to abide by the current policy framework before we can reinvent the wheel. The BOP has great 
policy which can be broadened but questionable leadership, transparency and accountability. Many 
reforms can be accomplished without legislation, algorithms, blue ribbon commissions, etc

The beast has been slayed. 
I organized the files out of the jumble that they were brought to us in. A few things that 
probably be helpful to know: 
1. 
There were some commissary receipts/finance documents pertaining to Epstein's activity inside of prison. I didn't 
know where to put this so I left it outside of the folders but still inside MCC Recs 
2. 
In the MCC Regs folder, I put a few things: 
a. 
One file had inventory and then at the end some documents pertaining to daily key counts. I wasn't sure 
if these were different so I created a separate file for the key counts just in case (while also keeping them 
in the inventory file) 
b. 
The MCC training 06-06-19 & information file was confusing to me. It was massive and I couldn't tell 
whether or not I needed to separate anything out. 
Everything else should be pretty straightforward as to where it is located. Let me know if you need me to clarify anything 
or help any further.

Re: 
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
The Government respectfully submits this letter to provide an update regarding the 
defendant's conditions of confinement at the Metropolitan Detention Center ("MDC") pursuant to 
the Court's Order dated August 25, 2020. (Dkt. No. 49). Over the past three months, the 
Government has had multiple conversations with MDC legal counsel regarding the defendant's 
conditions of confinement. This update is based on information provided to the Government by 
MDC legal during those conversations. 
Last week, a staff member who was assigned to work in the area of the MDC where the 
defendant is housed tested positive for COVID-19. In response, the MDC implemented the same 
quarantine protocols that apply whenever an inmate has potentially been exposed to the virus. 
Specifically, on November 18, 2020, the defendant was tested for COVID-19 using a rapid test, 
which was negative. That same day, the defendant was placed in quarantine. As with any other 
quarantined inmate, the defendant will remain in quarantine for fourteen days, at which point she 
will be tested again for COVID-19. If that test is negative, she will then be released from 
quarantine. To date, the defendant has not exhibited any symptoms of COVID-19. 
During her time in quarantine, the defendant will be housed in the same cell where she was 
already housed before she was placed in quarantine, and medical staff and psychology staff will 
continue to check on the defendant every day. Like all other MDC inmates in quarantine, the 
defendant will be permitted out of her cell three days per week for thirty minutes. During that 
time, the defendant may shower, make personal phone calls, and use the CorrLinks email system. 
In addition, the defendant will continue to be permitted to make legal calls every day for up to 
three hours per day. These calls will take place in a room where the defendant is alone and where 
no MDC staff can hear her communications with counsel. 
On November 18, 2020, the Government provided the MDC with a laptop for the defendant 
to use to review discovery. During quarantine, the defendant has been and will continue to be 
permitted to use that laptop in her isolation cell to review her discovery for thirteen hours per day, 
EFTA00027268
--- PAGE 2 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 74 Filed 11/23/20 Page 2 of 2 
Page 2 
seven days per week. Accordingly, the defendant is receiving the same amount of time to review 
her discovery and the same amount of time to speak with her lawyers as she received before 
entering quarantine. The defendant will not, however, be permitted to meet in person with her 
lawyers until she tests out of quarantine. 
After the defendant tests out of quarantine, she will resume the same schedule that the 
MDC implemented approximately three months ago. Specifically, from 7am to 8pm every day, 
the defendant will be permitted out of her isolation cell. During those thirteen hours, the defendant 
will have access to a computer on which to review her discovery outside of her cell. Also during 
the day, the defendant will be permitted to, among other things, make legal calls, make personal 
calls, access CorrLinks, and shower. From 8pm to 7am, the defendant will remain in her isolation 
cell. The defendant will also be permitted to have in-person visits with her attorneys up to three 
days per week for multiple hours per visit. On days when the defendant does not have in-person 
legal visits, she will have access to legal calls for up to three hours per day. 
As was the case three months ago, the defendant continues to have more time to review her 
discovery than any other inmate at the MDC, even while in quarantine. The defendant also has as 
much, if not more, time as any other MDC inmate to communicate with her attorneys, even while 
in quarantine. 
As noted above, over the past three months, the Government has repeatedly communicated 
both with MDC legal counsel and defense counsel regarding the defendant's conditions of 
confinement. Whenever the defense has raised a concern on this topic, the Government has 
immediately contacted MDC legal counsel to inquire about and, where appropriate, to address the 
concern. The Government will continue to keep those lines of communication open and will 
remain responsive to any concerns raised by the defense regarding the defendant's conditions of 
confinement. Should the Court have any questions or require any additional details regarding this 
topic, the Government will promptly provide additional information.

Re: 
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
The parties jointly submit this letter in response to the Court's November 24, 2020 order 
directing the parties to meet and confer regarding the defendant's request that the warden of the 
Metropolitan Detention Center ("MDC") report directly to the Court and counsel on the 
defendant's conditions of detention. (Dkt. No. 76). Over the past week, the Government has 
spoken with MDC legal counsel regarding the defendant's conditions of confinement and has tried 
to gather additional information regarding the concerns raised by the defendant, which the 
Government has shared with defense counsel. The Government has also conferred with defense 
counsel three times regarding the same, as well as the defense's request relating to MDC Warden 
Heriberto Tellez. The parties have been unable to reach agreement. Our respective positions 
follow. 
The Government respectfully submits that the Court should allow MDC legal counsel to 
respond directly in writing to the Court and defense counsel regarding the concerns defense 
counsel has raised relating to the defendant's conditions of confinement. The Government 
understands that MDC legal counsel is prepared to submit a letter by this Friday, December 4, 
2020. Such a letter is the appropriate next step at this time, as it will allow the Court to hear 
directly from MDC legal counsel who can address the defendant's conditions of confinement. The 
letter will allow the Court to ascertain whether further inquiry, including a personal appearance by 
the Warden or other MDC personnel, is necessary. Moreover, the Government does not 
understand the concerns raised by the defense to implicate the defendant's access to legal materials 
or her ability to communicate with her counsel. As noted in the Government's letter dated 
November 23, 2020, the defendant continues to have more time to review her discovery than any 
other inmate at the MDC. The defendant also has as much, if not more, time as any other MDC 
inmate to communicate with her attorneys. (Dkt. No. 74). 
The defense disagrees. As communicated to the Government, the defense's position is as 
follows: Warden Heriberto Tellez should appear before the Court to directly address concerns 
regarding Ms. Maxwell's conditions of confinement, which specifically target her. On October 
29, 2020, the defense emailed a letter to Warden Tellez detailing the onerous and restrictive 
conditions, including but not limited to concerns regarding the supplemental camera; excessive 
EFTA00027270

searching (e.g., weekly body scan, 15-minute interval flashlight checks at night, and open-mouth 
inspection) despite being surveilled 24/7 by a dedicated three-guard security detail and two 
cameras; and the reason she is not being moved to the day room, which we understood was the 
original plan (and would reduce searching). Receipt of the letter was acknowledged, but to date 
there has been no response and little, if any, redress to the most serious conditions. Upon 
information and belief, decisions concerning Ms. Maxwell's specialized detention are made by 
Warden Tellez, or from others outside the MDC. A report from the MDC Legal Department would 
provide second-hand information. Accordingly, Warden Tellez should be directed to provide a 
first-hand accounting to the Court and counsel why Ms. Maxwell is being detained under such 
individualized conditions. 
Your consideration is greatly appreciated.

DATE FILED: 12/7/20 
This letter is written in response to your order dated December 2, 2020, concerning Ghislaine 
Maxwell, Reg. 02879-509., an inmate currently confined at the Metropolitan Detention center in Brooklyn, 
New York. You expressed various concerns regarding Ms. Maxwell's confinement and well-being. 
The Bureau of Prisons' (BOP) policies and procedures are designed to ensure staff and inmates can 
work and live in a safe and secure environment. In determining Ms. Maxwell's current housing 
assignment, MDC Brooklyn considered various factors including Ms. Maxwell's expressed concern for 
her safety and well-being amongst the general inmate population. We have discussed our decision with 
Ms. Maxwell several times and provided her with guidance as to how to address any concerns through 
her Unit Team or the BOP's Administrative Remedy Program, 28 C.F.R. SS 542.10— 542.19. To date, 
staff have addressed her complaints in accordance with BOP policies. 
In her current assignment, Ms. Maxwell, like other inmates housed at MDC Brooklyn, is allowed 
access to the common area of the housing unit from 7:00 AM through 8:00 PM, daily. She has access to 
recreational space, social calls, television, shower, legal telephone calls, email, computers, and discovery 
material. A discovery laptop is available to her from 8:00 AM through 5:00 PM. When Ms. Maxwell 
returns to her cell at 8:00 PM, like other inmates she has access to drinking water, snacks she purchased 
through the commissary, and discovery material. Since August 3, 2020, Ms. Maxwell has been able to 
purchase items from the full commissary list. She receives commissary every second week like all other 
inmates. 
MDC Brooklyn correctional staff utilize flashlights when viewing inmate cells overnight to ensure 
EFTA00027272

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJNI Document 88 Filed 12/07/20 Page 2 of 2 
inmates are breathing and not in distress. Inmates in BOP custody are subject to searches, including 
body scanners, and inmates may be searched prior to moving from one area of the facility to another. 
The removal of Ms. Maxwell's face mask complies with the BOP's COVID-19 Pandemic Response Plan. 
Since Ms. Maxwell's arrival, she has been provided three (3) meals a day in accordance with BOP 
policy and its National Menu. Food Service staff have addressed Ms. Maxwell's requests. Ms. Maxwell is 
served her breakfast upon entering the common area of the housing unit at 7:00 AM; at noon she is 
served her lunch; and at 5:00 PM she is served dinner. Her medical records show that she currently 
weighs 134 lbs., which fluctuates plus or minus 2 lbs. Health Services staff make regular rounds of her 
housing unit and she has been instructed on how to request medical care through the sick call 
procedures. Furthermore, while there has been a number of inmates whom have tested positive for 
COVID-19, Ms. Maxwell remains in good health and is not in contact with those individuals. The BOP 
staff is assigned to Ms. Maxwell's unit do not come in contact with the other individuals whom have 
tested positive. Lastly, the temperature of Ms. Maxwell's cell is checked three times daily to ensure it is 
in compliance with national standards. 
In accordance with the BOP's COVID-19 Pandemic Response Plan, inmates are allotted 500 
minutes per month of social telephone calls, which Ms. Maxwell has used throughout her time at MDC 
Brooklyn. While Ms. Maxwell has received one legal video conference, she continues to have full access 
to legal telephone calls and in person legal visits. Pursuant to the District Courts guidance, legal 
telephone calls are scheduled through the Federal Defenders, who should be afforded an opportunity to 
address any concerns Ms. Maxwell's attorneys have with the legal calls. 
I trust this has addressed your concerns.

ORDER 
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
On December 4, 2020, the Court received a letter from MDC legal counsel responding to 
the concerns that the Defendant raised in her November 24, 2020 letter. See Dkt. Nos. 75, 88; 
see also Dkt. No. 78. The Defendant responded to the MDC legal counsel's letter on December 
7, 2020, reiterating her request that the Court summon Warden Heriberto Tellez to personally 
respond to questions from the Court regarding the Defendant's conditions of confinement. See 
Dkt. No. 91. Having carefully reviewed the parties' submissions, along with the MDC legal 
counsel's December 4, 2020 letter, the Court DENIES the Defendant's request to summon the 
Warden to personally appear and respond to questions. This resolves Dkt. No. 75. 
Notwithstanding this, as originally provided in Dkt. No. 49, the Government shall 
continue to submit written status updates detailing any material changes to the conditions of Ms. 
Maxwell's confinement, with particular emphasis on her access to legal materials, including 
legal mail and email, and her ability to communicate with defense counsel. The updates shall 
also include information on the frequency of searches of the Defendant. 
The Court hereby ORDERS the Government to submit these written updates every 60 
days. Furthermore, the Government shall take all necessary steps to ensure that the Defendant

Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
We write on behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, to respectfully request that the Court 
order the Bureau of Prisons to give Ms. Maxwell access to the laptop computer provided by the 
government so that she can review discovery on weekends and holidays. 
At the request of defense counsel, the government provided Ms. Maxwell with a laptop 
computer to review the voluminous discovery, which was produced on a series of external hard 
drives. Currently, Ms. Maxwell is given access to the laptop only on weekdays. On weekends 
and holidays, Ms. Maxwell must use the prison computer on her floor to review discovery. 
However, the prison computer is not equipped with the software necessary to read large portions 
of the discovery recently produced by the government. As a result, Ms. Maxwell loses several 
days of review time every weekend and every holiday because she does not have access to the 
laptop. If Ms. Maxwell is to have any hope of reviewing the millions of documents produced in 
discovery so that she can properly prepare her defense by the July 12, 2021 trial date, she must 
have access to the laptop every day, including weekends and holidays. 
Defense counsel has raised this issue with the government and it has no objection to Ms. 
Maxwell having access to the laptop seven days a week. At the request of defense counsel, the 
government has contacted officials at the MDC on several occasions in the past few weeks to 
request that they lift this restriction, but without success. 
There is no principled justification for this restriction. Ms. Maxwell was given access to 
the laptop every day (including weekends and the Thanksgiving holiday) for the entire 14-day 
period that she was quarantined in her isolation cell in November-December 2020 because she had 
come into close contact with a member of the MDC staff who had tested positive for COVID. In 
addition, the laptop is kept in a locker in the same room where the prison computer is located, so it

would not require any change in Ms. Maxwell's movements to give her the requested access. 
Furthermore, on at least three occasions since she was released from quarantine, Ms. Maxwell's 
security team gave her the laptop to review discovery on the weekend. 
There is clearly no actual impediment preventing the MDC staff from providing Ms. 
Maxwell access to the laptop on weekends and holidays. Given the millions of documents that 
Ms. Maxwell must review before trial in order to prepare her defense, it is critical that she be 
given as much time as possible with the laptop to review the discovery. We therefore respectfully 
request that the Court order the BOP to give Ms. Maxwell access to the laptop on weekends and 
holidays during the hours that she is permitted to review discovery.

submitted by the Bureau of Prisons 
("BOP") that the Court vacate its 
January 15, 2021 Order, Dkt. No. 117, 
as well as the Government's and the 
Defendant's responses, Dkt. Nos. 129, 
130, the Court hereby DENIES the 
BOP's request to vacate the Order. 
SO ORDERED. 
This letter is written in response to Order granted on January 15, 2021, concerning Ghislaine 
Maxwell, Reg. 02879-509., an inmate currently confined at the Metropolitan Detention Center ("MDC") in 
Brooklyn, New York. The MDC Brooklyn respectfully requests that Your Honor vacate the Order given 
MDC Brooklyn was not given the opportunity to object to defense counsel's claims, although the objection 
had been reiterated to the U.S. Attorney's Office numerous times. 
Defense counsel expressed various concerns regarding Ms. Maxwell's confinement limiting her 
access to discovery. However, Ms. Maxwell has received a significant amount of time to review her 
discovery. On November 18, 2020, the Government provided the MDC Brooklyn with a laptop for Ms. 
Maxwell to use to review discovery. Ms. Maxwell has been and will continue to be permitted to use that 
laptop to review her discovery for thirteen (13) hours per day, five (5) days per week. In addition to the 
Government laptop, she has access to the MDC Brooklyn discovery computers. Although defense counsel 
has indicated that the MDC Brooklyn discovery computers are not equipped to read all of her electronic 
discovery, the computers are capable of reviewing most of the electronic discovery. Despite defense 
counsel's claim that Ms. Maxwell's lacks sufficient time to fully review her discovery, her consistent use of 
Government laptop and MDC Brooklyn's discovery computers undercuts this claim. 
Moreover, Ms. Maxwell continues to have contact with her legal counsel five (5) days per week, three 
(3) hours per day via video-teleconference and via telephone; this is far more time than any other MDC 
inmate is allotted to communicate with their attorneys.

The Government respectfully submits this letter in response to the Court's January 25, 2021 
order allowing the parties to respond to a letter from legal counsel at the Metropolitan Detention 
Center ("MDC") also dated January 25, 2021. (Dkt. No. 117). In particular, MDC legal counsel 
asks the Court to vacate its January 15, 2021 order directing the MDC to permit the defendant to 
use a laptop to review discovery on weekends and holidays. While the Government has no 
objection to the defendant's request for additional laptop access, the Government also generally 
defers to the MDC regarding how it manages its inmate population. The Government will continue 
to defer to the MDC here, particularly because the defendant has had ample access to discovery 
even without laptop access on weekends and holidays. 
Given the volume of discovery in this case, which totals more than two million pages, the 
Government and the MDC have both made significant efforts to ensure that the defendant has 
extensive access to her discovery materials. Since the Government made its first discovery 
production in August 2020, the defendant has had exclusive access to a BOP desktop computer in 
the MDC on which to review her discovery. When the defendant complained of technical issues 
reviewing portions of her discovery on that desktop computer, the Government produced 
reformatted copies of discovery materials and instructions regarding how to open particular files. 
Because the defendant continued to complain that she was unable to review certain discovery files 
on the desktop computer, the Government agreed to provide a laptop for the defendant to use in 
her review of discovery. On November 18, 2020, the Government hand delivered the laptop to 
the MDC for the defendant's exclusive use. 
As the Court is aware, the defendant has received, and continues to receive more time to 
review her discovery than any other inmate at the MDC. In particular, the MDC permits the 
defendant to review discovery thirteen hours per day, seven days per week. On weekdays, the 
MDC permits the defendant to use the laptop during her thirteen hours of daily review time. On 
weekends and holidays, the MDC would ordinarily only allow the defendant to use the BOP 
desktop computer, which provides access to much of the discovery material. While, as noted 
above, the Government has no particular objection to the defendant's request for weekend access

to the laptop, the Government generally defers to the judgment of the MDC in managing inmates 
at its facility, and sees no reason to depart from that practice here. In this respect, the Government 
notes that the trial date remains approximately six months away, the BOP was already affording 
the defendant access to the laptop for some 65 hours a week, and the BOP was further providing 
weekend access to a desktop computer should the defendant wish to spend more than 65 hours 
each week reviewing discovery.

Re: 
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
The Government respectfully submits this letter to provide an update regarding the 
defendant's conditions of confinement at the Metropolitan Detention Center ("MDC") pursuant to 
the Court's Order dated December 8, 2020. (Dkt. No. 92). Over the past two months, the 
Government has had multiple communications with MDC legal counsel regarding the defendant's 
conditions of confinement. This update is based on information provided to the Government by 
MDC legal counsel through those communications. 
The defendant continues to receive more time to review discovery than any other inmate 
at the MDC. Specifically, the defendant is permitted to review her discovery thirteen hours per 
day, seven days per week. During the entirety of that time, the defendant has access to a desktop 
computer provided by the MDC on which to review discovery. Additionally, pursuant to the 
Court's January 15, 2021 Order, the defendant also has access to a laptop computer provided by 
the Government on which to review discovery for the full thirteen hours per day, seven days per 
week. Also during those thirteen hours per day, the defendant may use the MDC desktop computer 
to send and receive emails with her attorneys. 
The defendant also has as much, if not more, time as any other MDC inmate to 
communicate with her attorneys. Due to the elevated number of COVID-19 cases within the MDC, 
in-person visits have been suspended since in or about December 2020. While in-person visits are 
suspended, the defendant has had regular video-teleconference ("VTC") calls with her counsel. In 
particular, the defendant has VTC calls with her counsel every weekday for three hours per call. 
If defense counsel requires additional time to speak with the defendant, counsel may request to 
schedule an additional phone call on Saturdays as needed. All of these VTCs and telephone calls 
take place in a room where the defendant is alone and where no MDC staff can hear her 
communications with counsel. 
The defendant's legal mail is processed in the same manner as mail for all other inmates at 
the MDC. All inmate mail is sent to the MDC's mail room, where every piece of mail is processed 
EFTA00027282
--- PAGE 16 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 158 Filed 02/05/21 Page 2 of 2 
Page 2 
before being provided to the inmate recipient. Due to the large number of MDC inmates and the 
volume of mail received at the MDC, this process can take multiple days. As noted above, 
however, the defendant is able to send and receive emails with defense counsel every day and has 
regular communication with counsel via VTC. 
MDC staff conduct two pat-down searches of the defendant per day: once when she is 
moved from her isolation cell to the day room each morning, and once when returns from the day 
room to her isolation cell each night. As part of those searches, the defendant is required to remove 
her mask and open her mouth briefly so that MDC staff, who remain masked during the searches, 
can confirm she has not hidden contraband in her mouth. These pat-down and mouth searches are 
consistent with MDC's policy that all inmates be searched whenever they move to a different 
location within the jail facility. Previously, the defendant attended VTC conferences in a separate 
part of the MDC, requiring that she be searched when taken to and from her VTC calls with 
counsel. Recently, however, the MDC changed the location of the defendant's VTC calls so that 
the defendant does not need to leave her unit in order to attend VTC calls with her counsel, thereby 
reducing the number of searches. During the suspension of visitation, the defendant has not been 
strip searched. When visitation resumes, the defendant, like all other inmates, will be strip 
searched after any in-person visit. 
In addition, MDC staff search the defendant's cell for contraband once per day. MDC staff 
also conduct a body scan on the defendant once per week to check for any secreted contraband. 
At night, MDC staff are required to confirm that the defendant is not in distress every fifteen 
minutes. To do so, staff point a flashlight to the ceiling of the defendant's cell to illuminate the 
cell sufficiently to confirm that the defendant is breathing every fifteen minutes. The MDC 
continues to assess that these searches are all necessary for the safety of the institution and the 
defendant. 
Should the Court have any questions or require any additional details regarding this topic, 
the Government will promptly provide additional information.

Re:

Dear Judge Nathan: 
The Government respectfully submits this letter to provide an update regarding the 
defendant's conditions of confinement at the Metropolitan Detention Center ("MDC") pursuant to 
the Court's Order dated December 8, 2020. (Dkt. No. 92). This update is based on information 
provided to the Government by MDC legal counsel regarding the conditions of the defendant's 
confinement over the last two months. 
The defendant continues to receive more time to review discovery than any other inmate 
at the MDC. Specifically, the defendant is permitted to review her discovery thirteen hours per 
day, seven days per week. During the entirety of that time, the defendant has access to both a 
desktop computer provided by the MDC and a laptop computer provided by the Government on 
which to review discovery. Also during those thirteen hours per day, the defendant may use the 
MDC desktop computer to send and receive emails with her attorneys.' This discovery review 
Per BOP policy, all inmate emails are routinely purged every six months. In response to 
complaints from the defendant and defense counsel regarding prematurely deleted emails, MDC 
staff examined the defendant's inmate email account. That examination revealed that the 
defendant had herself deleted some of her emails and had archived others. That examination 
revealed no evidence to suggest that MDC staff deleted any of the defendant's emails.

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 196 Filed 04/06/21 Page 2 of 6 
Page 2 
takes place in a day room that is separate from the defendant's isolation cell. Accordingly, the 
defendant is permitted out of her cell from 7am to 8pm every day. While in the day room, the 
defendant has exclusive access to the MDC desktop computer, the laptop, a television, a phone on 
which to place social or attorney calls, and a shower. The defendant is also permitted outdoor 
recreation every day, although she has the option of declining such recreation time if she wishes. 
The defendant also has as much, if not more, time as any other MDC inmate to 
communicate with her attorneys. 
Currently, the defendant receives five hours of video-
teleconference ("VTC") calls with her counsel every weekday, for a total of 25 hours of attorney 
VTC calls per week. At times, unexpected incidents, such as institution-wide lockdowns or short 
staffing, delay the defendant's arrival to her VTC call with counsel by up to 30 minutes. When 
such delay occurs, however, the MDC permits the defendant to make up for any missed time either 
by extending that day's VTC call or by permitting the defendant extra time on the next day's VTC 
call. All of these VTC calls take place in a room where the defendant is alone and where no MDC 
staff can hear her communications with counsel. During these VTC calls, MDC staff place a 
camera approximately 30 feet away from the door to the room where the defendant conducts the 
VTC calls. The camera has a full view of the door to the VTC room, but the camera cannot view 
either the defendant or her attorneys while the door is closed during VTC calls. The camera does 
not capture any sound from the defendant's VTC calls with her attorneys. In other words, the 
camera records who enters and exits the VTC room, but it does not record activity inside the VTC 
room. The defendant is also permitted to use the phone in the day room to place phone calls to her 
attorneys as needed. 
In addition, defense counsel now have the option of meeting with the defendant in person 
at the MDC. On or about February 16, 2021, the MDC resumed in-person visitation. As a result, 
EFTA00027285
--- PAGE 19 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 196 Filed 04/06/21 Page 3 of 6 
Page 3 
in-person attorney visits are now available seven days per week. The MDC has placed HEPA air 
filters in its attorney visiting rooms to improve air quality during visits. Additionally, the 
defendant has received the COVID-19 vaccine and is now fully vaccinated. The Government 
understands that defense counsel have thus far declined to meet with the defendant in person and 
instead rely on VTC calls, email, and supplemental phone calls to communicate with their client. 
The option of in-person visits remains available seven days per week should defense counsel wish 
to meet with the defendant in person. 
The defendant's legal mail is processed in the same manner as mail for all other inmates at 
the MDC. All inmate mail is sent to the MDC's mail room, where every piece of mail is processed 
before being provided to the inmate recipient. Due to the large number of MDC inmates and the 
volume of mail received at the MDC, this process can take multiple days. As noted above, 
however, the defendant is able to send and receive emails with defense counsel every day and has 
regular communication with counsel via VTC, which can be supplemented by phone calls. 
Like any other inmate, the defendant is patted down by MDC staff whenever she is moved 
to a different part of the facility. Typically, these searches include at least two pat-down searches 
of the defendant per day: once when she is moved from her isolation cell to the day room each 
morning, and once when returns from the day room to her isolation cell each night. In addition, 
when the defendant elects to attend outdoor recreation, she is searched two additional times: once 
when she is moved to the recreation area, and once when she returns to the day room from the 
recreation area. MDC staff also conduct a body scan, which is a non-invasive machine scan, on 
the defendant once per week to check for any secreted contraband. Because those scans take place 
in a different part of the facility than the day room, the defendant is patted down two additional 
times when these weekly scans occur: once when she is moved to the scan area, and once when 
EFTA00027286

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 196 Filed 04/06/21 Page 4 of 6 
Page 4 
she returns to the day room from the scan area. As part of every pat-down search, the defendant 
is required to remove her mask and open her mouth briefly so that MDC staff, who remain masked 
during the searches, can confirm she has not hidden contraband in her mouth.' These pat-down 
and mouth searches are consistent with MDC's policy that all inmates be searched whenever they 
move to a different location within the jail facility. In the absence of in-person visitation, the 
defendant has not been strip searched. If the defendant receives in-person visits, then she, like all 
other inmates, will be strip searched after any in-person visit. 
In addition, MDC staff search the defendant's cell for contraband once per day. At night, 
MDC staff are required to confirm every fifteen minutes that the defendant is not in distress. To 
do so, every fifteen minutes, staff point a flashlight to the concrete ceiling of the defendant's cell 
to illuminate the cell sufficiently to confirm that the defendant is breathing. At night, MDC staff 
have observed that the defendant wears an eye mask when she sleeps, limiting the disturbance 
caused by the flashlight. Additionally, MDC staff have observed that the defendant regularly 
sleeps through these nighttime wellness checks. The MDC continues to be of the view that all of 
these searches are necessary for the safety of the institution and the defendant. 
The Government also inquired regarding certain complaints defense counsel raised in 
February 2021 regarding the defendant's food, water, and physical wellbeing. In response, MDC 
Following defense counsel's complaint in its February 16, 2021 letter of an inappropriately 
conducted pat-down search, the MDC conducted an investigation and found that, contrary to the 
defendant's claim, the search in question was in fact recorded in full by a handheld camera. After 
reviewing the camera footage, the MDC concluded that the search was conducted appropriately 
and the defendant's complaint about that incident was unfounded. MDC legal counsel further 
confirmed that all pat-down searches of the defendant are video recorded. Following this incident, 
MDC staff directed the defendant to clean her cell because it had become very dirty. Among other 
things, MDC staff noted that the defendant frequently did not flush her toilet after using it, which 
caused the cell to smell. In addition, the defendant had not cleaned her cell in some time, causing 
the cell to become increasingly dirty. MDC staff directed the defendant to clean her cell in 
response to the smell and the dirtiness, not as retaliation for complaining about a particular search.

legal counsel informed the Government that the defendant's meals arrive in containers that are 
both microwavable and oven safe. Currently, the defendant's meals are heated in a thermal oven. 
The tap water available in the MDC is provided by New York City. As a result, on occasions 
when the City has conducted maintenance near the MDC, the water has been temporarily shut off. 
During those periods, MDC staff have provided all inmates, including the defendant, with bottled 
water. After the water is turned back on, the water is sometimes cloudy or brown and needs to run 
for several seconds before becoming clear. MDC staff have not observed any instance in which 
the water in the defendant's cell did not clear after being run for several seconds. MDC legal 
counsel emphasized that MDC staff, including the legal staff, drink the same tap water from the 
same water system as the defendant while in the institution. 
MDC medical staff monitor the defendant daily and weigh the defendant at least once per 
week. During her time at the MDC, the defendant's weight has fluctuated between the 130s and 
the 140s. The defendant's lowest observed weight was 133 pounds in July of 2021. Since then, 
her weight has fluctuated but has never been lower than 134 pounds. Most recently, when the 
defendant was weighed last week, her weight was 137.5 pounds. The defendant is 5' 7", meaning 
that even her lowest weight of 133 pounds resulted in a BMI of 20.8, which is considered a normal 
weight for a person of the defendant's height. MDC staff have not observed the defendant 
experience any noticeable hair loss. As noted above, the defendant has received a COVID-19 
vaccine and is now fully vaccinated. In short, MDC medical staff assess that the defendant is 
physically healthy.

Re:

Dear Counsel: 
Today we are producing the materials listed in the below index. These discovery materials 
are stamped with control numbers SDNY_GM_02753644 through SDNY_GM_02753697. 
Please note that both this letter and the enclosed materials are governed by the July 31, 
2020 Protective Order in this case. This letter is itself designated as "confidential," because it 
includes information regarding records designated as "confidential" under the Protective 
Order. Recently, the Department of Justice directed this office to cease the dissemination of 
materials marked with the word "confidential" in order to avoid potential confusion with markings 
reserved for classified documents. Accordingly, in order to note the appropriate designation of this 
production under the operative Protective Order in this case, the materials being produced today 
are marked with the following label: "SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER PARAGRAPHS 7,

Thanks so much, 
! For the index and the cover letter, would you please break out the "FBI Recovered Metadata" 
into two rows that correspond with the subfolders within that folder on the share? The first row should be entitled "Files 
Recovered from Discs Seized from Epstein NY Residence" and the second row should be entitled "De-Designated Images 
from Epstein's Electronic Devices". 
Also, I'd like to add the following language below the index in the cover letter, please: 
"Please note that the files recovered from discs seized from Jeffrey Epstein's New York residence and the De-Designated 
Images from Epstein's Electronic Devices are being produced to you with html files that contain thumbnails of each image 
and any recovered metadata next to each thumbnail. In order to view the full size image from a particular row in the html 
file, click on the thumbnail, which will automatically open up the full size image from within the folder structure 
maintained in the folder entitled "Files." Use of these html files does not require Internet access, but does require that 
the file structure within the folder entitled "Files" remain unchanged. 
Additionally, certain of the files that were recovered from the discs seized from Epstein's New York residence are not 
viewable on the FBI's system. In the interest of completeness, however, we are producing to you every file that was 
recovered from those discs, including those that are not openable or viewable."

The entire production has now been stamped and is ready for your review. With the exception of the FBI Recovered 
Metadata (which is on a hard drive; we will askM/IT to make us an internal copy of the stamped version), the rest of 
the production is saved here on the shared. The index is also attached and saved here. Finally, I attached a draft cover 
letter for defense counsel (also saved here). I'm happy to make any changes to the production, index, or cover letter as 
needed. 
If it looks good to go, we can start loading the materials once the hard drives from defense arrive. Thanks so much!

Hi all, 
>;

Mike has finished pulling the FBI Recovered Metadata from the shared, so we will be able to stamp those materials soon. 
They are 217 GB in size, so we should ask defense counsel for a 500GB drive for us to load the entire Nineteenth 
Production onto. In the meantime, I had a couple questions regarding the remaining materials in the pending production: 
1. How would you like the JP Morgan Chase returns stamped? We can give each production folder its own Bates 
stamp, but unfortunately we can't stamp each individual file since it's in a load file format; we would have to ask 
to do so. I'm happy to coordinate whatever you prefer. 
2. How would you like us to stamp the materials so that they comply with the correct protective order designation? 
We can use "SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER PARAGRAPHS 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, and 17," as we did in the most recent 
3500 production, but I wanted to confirm with you all first. 
I'm happy to chat further if anything's unclear. Thanks very much, all!

Re: 
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) 
Dear Counsel: 
Today we are producing the materials listed in the below index. These discovery materials 
are stamped with control numbers SDNY_GM_02753644 through SDNY_GM_02753697. 
Please note that both this letter and the enclosed materials are governed by the July 31, 
2020 Protective Order in this case. This letter is itself designated as "confidential," because it 
includes information regarding records designated as "confidential" under the Protective 
Order. Recently, the Department of Justice directed this office to cease the dissemination of 
materials marked with the word "confidential" in order to avoid potential confusion with markings 
reserved for classified documents. Accordingly, in order to note the appropriate designation of this 
production under the operative Protective Order in this case, the materials being produced today 
are marked with the following label: "SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER PARAGRAPHS 7, 
8, 9, 10, 15, and 17." This marking directly refers to the specific paragraphs of the Protective Order 
that govern today's production.

Hope you're doing well. Ghislaine Maxwell's attorney has informed me that Maxwell is having difficulty reviewing the 
portions of her discovery that include audio recordings on the laptop my office provided for her use. The attorney seems 
to think that the issue can be fixed if someone from MDC's IT department could assist Maxwell in enabling the audio jack 
so that Maxwell can use headphones to listen to the recordings. Would it be possible to ask someone from IT to please 
look into this issue? 
Thanks very much,

Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT Document 35 Filed 04/24/20 Page 6 of 34 
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 
The Government respectfully submits this memorandum of law in opposition to defendant 
Michael Thomas's motion to compel discovery. (Dkt. No. 33) ("Mot."). Thomas seeks an order 
compelling the Government to collect materials that are not in its possession, not discoverable 
under any legal basis, and not related to any legally cognizable defense. Thomas's motion is 
entirely without merit and should be denied.' 
Thomas concedes that the Government has produced a "multitude" of discovery directly 
relevant to the charges against him. (Mot. 6). Nonetheless, he seeks an order compelling the 
Government to collect and produce additional materials that he believes would support his 
purported defenses, namely, that he committed the offenses because of staffing issues and 
supervisory lapses, and that he was singled out for prosecution. Specifically, Thomas seeks: (i) a 
copy of a report being prepared by the Department of Justice, Office of the Inspector General 
("DOJ-OIG"), which does not yet exist and would principally be based on the same primary 
materials that the Government produced to Thomas in December 2019 (Mot. 5, 8-9); (ii) reports 
and documents prepared by the Bureau of Prisons ("BOP") and other agencies who were not and 
are not members of the prosecution team (Mot. 6-7); (iii) reports and documents related to "any 
and all [Metropolitan Correctional Center ("MCC")] employees" who have engaged in "the same 
or similar conduct," including an incident in "2005 or 2006" where officers failed to conduct 
counts or rounds and an inmate committed suicide (Mot. 6); and (iv) reports, statistics, and 
documents related to purported staffing issues, supervisory lapses, and the application of BOP 
Tova Noel did not file any pretrial motions, and has not joined in Thomas's pretrial 
motions. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(c)(3) ("If a party does not meet the deadline for making a Rule 
12(b)(3) motion, the motion is untimely. But a court may consider the defense, objection, or 
request if the party shows good cause.").

policies which relate to the "much larger context" at the BOP (Mot. 6, 7, 9, 10). 
As an initial matter, the Government has satisfied its Rule 16, Brady, and Giglio obligations 
and is not in possession of the additional materials that Thomas seeks. More importantly, Thomas 
is not entitled to compel the Government to collect the additional records for at least four separate 
reasons. First, the records are not "material" to preparing a defense because they are wholly 
irrelevant to the false statement charges against Thomas and are intended to prompt jurors to 
nullify the charges against him. Second, the BOP records Thomas seeks are not in the "possession" 
of the prosecution team, and there is no legal basis for compelling the Government to collect 
materials from other agencies or components of the Department of Justice who are not and were 
not part of the criminal investigation that led to the charges against Thomas. Third, there is no 
legal basis to require the Government to produce a draft of the report being prepared by the DOJ-
OIG, which is subject to the deliberative process privilege. Fourth, Thomas is not entitled to 
discovery relating to what happened to other MCC employees when they "falsiflied] the same 
documents," (Mot. 6), because he has utterly failed to identify evidence that the decision to 
prosecute him had a discriminatory effect and was motivated by a discriminatory purpose. 
Thomas's motion should be denied in all respects. 
STATEMENT OF FACTS 
1. 
The Indictment 
Indictment 19 Cr. 830 (AT) (the "Indictment") was filed on November 19, 2019, charging 
defendants Tova Noel and Michael Thomas in six counts: (i) conspiring to defraud the United 
States and to make or use a false writing or document, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, 
Section 371 (Count One); and (ii) five counts of making or using a false writing or document, in 
violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1001(a)(3) and 3 (Counts Two through Six).

Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT Document 35 Filed 04/24/20 Page 8 of 34 
Both defendants are charged in Counts One, Four, Five, and Six; defendant Noel only is charged 
in Counts Two and Three. The charges in the Indictment stem from a fourteen-hour time period, 
from approximately 4:00 p.m. on August 9, 2019 to approximately 6:30 a.m. the following day, 
August 10, 2019, when the defendants were working as correctional officers at the MCC. As 
charged in the Indictment, during that time period, the defendants failed to perform mandated 
counts of prisoners housed in MCC's Special Housing Unit ("SHU"), but nevertheless signed false 
certifications attesting to having conducted those counts, when, in fact, no counts or rounds of the 
SHU were conducted from approximately 10:30 p.m. on August 9 to 6:30 a.m. on August 10. 
II. 
Pretrial Discovery and the Defendants' Request for Additional Materials 
A. 
The Government's Discovery Production 
At the initial pretrial conference on November 25, 2019, the Court set a discovery deadline 
of December 31, 2019. On that date, pursuant to a protective order entered by the Court, the 
Government made a substantial discovery production to both defendants, consisting in part of the 
following: surveillance video for the common area of the SHU; analysis of the computers used by 
Noel and Thomas from August 9 to 10, 2019; count slips and thirty-minute round reports; MCC 
phone records; personnel records and prior work schedules; and reports and notes of witness 
interviews prepared by agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI") and the DOJ-OIG 
who were participating in the investigation.2
Subsequently, the Government made three additional discovery productions, much more 
limited in scope. On January 23, 2020, the Government produced additional interview reports and 
The Government does not concede that production of all of the materials was required 
under Rule 16, but nonetheless produced the materials in its possession out of an abundance of 
caution. 
EFTA00027314

Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT Document 35 Filed 04/24/20 Page 9 of 34 
notes. On January 30, 2020,3 the Government reproduced video surveillance footage with 
timestamps, and on March 16, 2020, the Government produced forensic reports for three electronic 
devices and a photograph of a text message. 
B. 
Defense Requests for Additional Discovery Materials 
The defendants have made a number of requests for additional discovery materials, in 
response to which the Government has provided information in its possession as consistent with 
Rule 16 and its other disclosure obligations, as described below. 
At the initial pretrial conference on November 11, 2019, Thomas, through counsel, raised 
the issue of an "ongoing . . . report" by the Office of the Inspector General and requested the 
"status" of the report and when it would be completed.4 (Conf. Tr., Nov. 25, 2019, at 3-4, 7-9). 
In response, the Government explained that "to the extent counsel's asking for a summary of the 
results of the criminal investigation, obviously we'll be turning over in discovery all of the 
underlying results of the criminal investigation. . . I don't have a time frame on the Mnspector 
[G]eneral report, but the [G]ovemment will produce to the defense all of the relevant discovery 
materials in this matter, which includes the Rule 16 materials relevant to the criminal charges that 
have been brought against the defendants." (Id. at 7-8). As there was no pending issue to resolve, 
the Court declined to rule at that time. 
On January 29, 2020, Thomas and Noel each submitted discovery requests to the 
Government. Thomas's letter reiterated his prior request for "any and all reports, memorandums, 
The January 30, 2020 production was made to Noel's counsel on January 24, 2020, while 
the Government was still waiting for an additional hard drive from Thomas's counsel. 
Based on conversations with attorneys at DOJ-OIG tasked with preparing this report, the 
Government understands that the report will likely focus on the events surrounding the death of 
Jeffrey Epstein and BOP policies and procedures. 
EFTA00027315
--- PAGE 10 ---
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT Document 35 Filed 04/24/20 Page 10 of 34 
written statements, photos, videos, and incident reports created, manufactured or possessed by the 
United States Inspector General." Noel's January 29 letter sought materials related to the MCC 
video surveillance system and additional surveillance video, as well as assistance locating 
particular information in the surveillance video footage that the Government had previously 
produced in discovery. 
At the pretrial conference the following day, Thomas, through counsel, renewed his request 
for "whatever investigation was done and whatever information there is that is discoverable with 
respect to the Inspector General's report." (Conf. Tr., Jan. 30, 2020, at 6, 9). The Court directed 
Thomas to file a motion formalizing his request. (Id. at 9).5
The Government responded to the defendants' discovery requests by letter dated March 
14, 2020. As for Thomas's request for materials related to any forthcoming Inspector General's 
report, the Government referred Thomas to its prior response as stated at the November 25, 2019 
pretrial conference. With respect to Noel's requests for additional materials related to the MCC 
video surveillance system, the Government explained that to the extent such materials were in the 
Government's possession and currently subject to disclosure, they had already been produced. In 
addition, the Government provided additional information answering certain of Noel's questions, 
including video timestamps to assist with review of the surveillance footage. 
On March 27, 2020, Thomas submitted another discovery request to the Government, 
seeking, among other things, information from the BOP regarding other correctional officers and 
information about the Government's charging decisions. The Government responded by letter 
Thomas, through counsel, previewed that he would also likely file a motion to dismiss 
the indictment based on "selective prosecution." (Conf. Tr., Jan. 30, 2020 at 6). The deadline for 
filing motions, which was extended at counsel's request, has passed, and Thomas has failed to 
timely file a motion to dismiss. 
EFTA00027316
--- PAGE 11 ---
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT Document 35 Filed 04/24/20 Page 11 of 34 
dated April I, 2020, explaining that any responsive information in the Government's possession 
and subject to disclosure had already been produced. The letter further explained that to the extent 
the requests called for items not in the Government's possession or not subject to disclosure, 
Thomas had not identified any legal basis or authority for his requests and the Government was 
not aware of any authority requiring the Government to obtain or produce the requested 
information. 
On April 9, 2020, Thomas filed the instant motion seeking an order from the Court 
compelling the Government to produce the following: 
• 
The Inspector General's report investigating the death of Jeffrey Epstein 
and BOP policies and procedures (referred to herein as the "Inspector 
General's Report"), as well as all supporting memoranda and other 
documents, (Mot. 4-5); 
• 
Any and all "reports generated by investigators within the [BOP] regarding 
the August 10, 2019 incident" as well as "documents, reports, witness 
statements and disciplinary records of any and all MCC employees who 
have engaged in the same or similar conduct," including "results of any 
disciplinary proceedings and documents maintained by the BOP regarding 
the discipline or administrative adjudication of any other employees who 
have failed to conduct rounds or inmate counts," (Mot. 4, 6); 
• 
Any previously undisclosed reports, witness statements, and documents 
created by "any other federal agencies that investigated the circumstances 
surrounding the death of Jeffrey Epstein," (Mot. 4, 7). 
For the reasons that follow, Thomas is not entitled to the materials he seeks, and his motion 
should be denied.

ARGUMENT 
I. 
Applicable Law 
A. 
Brady & Giglio 
The Government has an obligation under the Due Process Clause to make a timely 
disclosure of any exculpatory or impeaching evidence that is material and in its possession. See 
Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963); Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972); see also 
United States v. Coppa, 267 F.3d 132, 139-40 (2d Cir. 2001). Evidence is "material" in this sense 
only if "its suppression undermines confidence in the outcome of a trial." United States v. Bagley, 
473 U.S. 667, 678 (1985). "The rationale underlying Brady is not to supply a defendant with all 
the evidence in the Government's possession which might conceivably assist the preparation of 
his defense, but to assure that the defendant will not be denied access to exculpatory evidence only 
known to the Government." United States v. LeRoy, 687 F.2d 610, 619 (2d Cir. 1982) (citing 
United States v. Ruggiero, 472 F.2d 599, 604 (2d Cir. 1973)). 
Impeachment evidence is material only "where the witness at issue supplied the only 
evidence linking the defendant(s) to the crime, or where the likely impact on the witness's 
credibility would have undermined a critical element of the prosecution's case." United States v. 
Payne, 63 F.3d 1200, 1210 (2d Cir. 1995) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). 
Similarly, "where the undisclosed evidence merely furnishes an additional basis on which to 
challenge a witness whose credibility has already been shown to be questionable or is subject to 
extensive attack by reason of other evidence, the undisclosed evidence may properly be viewed as 
cumulative, and hence not material." United States v. Persico, 645 F.3d 85, 111 (2d Cir. 2011) 
(citing cases). With regard to the timing of disclosing material under Giglio, the Second Circuit, 
in Coppa, rejected the argument that such material should be disclosed when defendants make a 
EFTA00027318
--- PAGE 13 ---
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT Document 35 Filed 04/24/20 Page 13 of 34 
demand for it. 267 F.3d at 146. The court held that as a general rule, Brady and its progeny do 
not require immediate disclosure of all impeachment material upon a defendant's request. Id. It 
found that the time required for its effective use would depend on the materiality of the evidence 
as well as the particular circumstances of the case, and suggested that district courts may order 
disclosure of material it deems material as a matter of case management. Id. As described above, 
the Government disclosed reports and notes of witness statements as part of its discovery 
productions, such that the defendants will have possessed substantial material that may serve as 
potential impeachment evidence for one year in advance of trial. 
B. 
Rule 16 
Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires the Government to permit the 
defendants to inspect and copy documents and objects within the Government's possession, 
custody, or control if the items are material to preparing the defense, if the Government intends to 
use them in its case-in-chief at trial, or if the items were obtained from or belong to the defendant. 
Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(1)(E). An item is "material to preparing the defense" under Rule 16 "if it 
could be used to counter the Government's case or bolster a defense." United States v. Stevens, 
985 F.2d 1175, 1180-81 (2d Cir. 1993). 
II. 
Thomas is Not Entitled to Additional Materials 
A. 
The Government Has Satisfied its Discovery and Disclosure Obligations 
As an initial matter, the Government is aware of, has satisfied, and will continue to satisfy 
its discovery and disclosure obligations. 
The Government has met its Rule 16 discovery and disclosure obligations. As set forth 
above, the Government has produced an expansive amount of discovery, which includes among 
other things, hundreds of hours of video surveillance going back to July 5, 2019 (despite the fact 
EFTA00027319
--- PAGE 14 ---
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT Document 35 Filed 04/24/20 Page 14 of 34 
that the Indictment relates to a 14-hour time period); count slips, thirty minute round forms, and 
staffing rosters for the three-week period surrounding Epstein's suicide; internal MCC phone 
records; employee files and staffing history for Noel and Thomas; and a wide range of written 
Bureau of Prison policies and regulations, among other documents and materials. In addition and 
while not required by Rule 16, the Government produced months in advance of trial (and now, 
approximately a year in advance of trial) statements for all of the witnesses interviewed during the 
investigation. While the Government is not aware of any other information that warrants 
disclosure, it will produce any such materials to the extent it becomes aware of them. 
The Government is likewise aware of, and has complied with, its Brady and Giglio 
obligations. The Government has already produced any evidence in its possession that is arguably 
exculpatory or impeaching. To the extent Giglio material exists in notes of witness statements or 
attorney proffers made on behalf of witnesses that have not already been produced, the 
Government intends to comply with its obligations and will make such disclosures sufficiently in 
advance of trial to be effectively used. Based on that representation alone, the defendant's motion 
should be denied. See United States v. Gonzalez, No. 19 Cr. 123-2 (NRB), 2020 WL 1809293, at 
*5 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 9, 2020) (denying a motion to compel because the government "represented 
that it had complied with and would continue to comply with its Brady and Rule 16 obligations); 
United States v. Undenvood, No. 04 Cr. 424 (RWS), 2005 WL 927012, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 21, 
2005) ("The courts of this Circuit repeatedly have denied pretrial requests for discovery orders 
pursuant to Brady where the government has made such good faith representations."); United 
States v. Perez, 940 F. Supp. 540, 553 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) (denying defendant's motion to compel 
production of Brady based on Government's representation that it was aware of and had complied 
with Brady).

B. 
The Requested Records Are Not "Material" to Preparing a Defense and Are 
Sought for the Impermissible Purpose of Jury Nullification 
All of the records Thomas seeks in his motion are not "material to preparing a defense" 
under Rule 16, and are not exculpatory under Brady, because they are irrelevant to countering the 
Government's false statements case or advancing a legitimate defense. Instead, Thomas seeks 
evidence of staffing shortages, working conditions, the implementation of BOP policies, 
supervisory lapses, and instances in which other BOP employees were not prosecuted so that he 
can engage in attempted jury nullification by arguing that those conditions "led" to the criminal 
conduct that he is charged with and are a reason to acquit him. (Mot. 5, 7, 9, 14). Thomas is not 
entitled to records—and certainly would not be entitled to introduce any such evidence at trial—
that would aid in that nullification effort because Rule 16 only entitles a defendant to discovery 
for purposes of bolstering a defense to the Government's case in chief, not the merits of the 
decision to prosecute. 
1. 
Applicable Law 
An item or record that the Government does not intend to use in its case-in-chief at trial is 
discoverable under Rule 16(a)(1)(E) only if it "is material to preparing the defense." Fed. R. Crim. 
P. 16(a)(1)(E). "It is [a defendant's] burden to make a prima facie showing that documents sought 
under Rule 16(a)(1)(E)(i) are material to preparing the defense." United States v. Rigas, 258 F. 
Supp. 2d 299, 307 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (citing United States v. McGuinness, 764 F. Supp. 888, 894 
(S.D.N.Y. 1991)). As noted above, an item is "material to preparing the defense" under Rule 16 
"if it could be used to counter the Government's case or bolster a defense." Stevens, 985 F.2d at 
1180-81. The defendant must "offer more than the conclusory allegation that the requested 
evidence is material." Rigas, 258 F. Supp. 2d at 307 (internal citation omitted). 
As the Supreme Court held in United States v. Armstrong, while Rule 16 authorizes 
EFTA00027321
--- PAGE 16 ---
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT Document 35 Filed 04/24/20 Page 16 of 34 
defendants to examine records "material to the preparation of their defense against the 
Government's case in chief," it does not authorize discovery for defenses that do not rebut the 
"merits to the criminal charge itself." 517 U.S. 456, 462-63 (1996) (holding that Rule 16 does not 
authorize discovery relating to a selective prosecution claim). For that reason, because evidence 
that would be impermissibly used to encourage jury nullification does not relate to the merits of 
the criminal charges, it is not discoverable under Rule 16. Id.; see also United States v. Defreitas, 
No. 07 Cr. 543 (DLI), 2011 WL 317964, at *10 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 31, 2011) (rejecting discovery 
request related to something that is "not a defense" and has "nothing to do with the issues of 
whether defendants . . . committed the ... crimes charged"). Since jury nullification is "a practice 
whereby a juror votes in purposeful disregard of the evidence," United States v. Thomas, 116 F.3d 
606, 614 (2d Cir. 1997), or "out of compassion or compromise," Standefer v. United States, 447 
U.S. 10, 22 (1980) (internal citation omitted), it is not error for a court to preclude evidence that is 
"not a valid defense" aimed at nullification, United States v. Edwards, 101 F.3d 17, 19-20 (2d Cir. 
1996). See also United States v. Reese, 933 F. Supp. 2d 579, 583-84 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (precluding 
defense arguments or evidence related to "possible consequences for the defendant of conviction, 
jury nullification, and the Government's motive and conduct in prosecuting [defendant]"); United 
States v. Levin, No. 15 Cr. 101 (KBF), 2016 WL 299031, at *12 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 25, 2016) (barring 
evidence "intended to elicit sympathy" and attempts to "use jury nullification as a defense" as 
"plainly improper"). Indeed, "trial courts have the duty to forestall or prevent jury nullification" 
even where the defendant or the court may "strongly disagree[] with the government's charging 
decisions and the attendant sentencing consequences." United States v. Manzano, 945 F.3d 616, 
626-27 (2d Cir. 2019) (citations & quotation marks omitted).

2. 
Discussion 
Thomas's motion makes clear that he intends for his principal defense at trial to be that—
irrespective of his guilt or innocence of the false statements charges—he should be acquitted 
because the MCC was understaffed, Thomas was overworked, his supervisors did not catch his 
crime in the moment, and falsification of count slips is rampant within the BOP. (See Mot. 3 
("staffing issues, staffing shortages, supervisory lapses and the enforcement/interpretation of BOP 
procedures go to the heart of his defense to the government's criminal allegations"); 9 ("Mr. 
Thomas will assert that the rampant staffing shortages present at the MCC in August of 2019 led 
to the conduct for which Mr. Thomas is now criminally charged.")). Thomas has failed to meet 
his burden in establishing the materiality of discovery about these topics to preparing a valid 
defense because the materials he seeks do not rebut the merits of the criminal charges and instead 
would be impermissibly used to encourage jury nullification. 
The purported reasons for Thomas's decision to falsify count slips—being tired, 
overworked, or understaffed—are not a valid legal defense, and therefore evidence related to those 
issues is not relevant. Put simply, were the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Thomas 
intentionally made materially false statements and also that did so while tired or overworked, it 
would still be required to convict him. See United States v. Carr, 424 F.3d 213,221 (2d Cir. 2005) 
(holding that "it was proper for the district court to instruct the jury that it had a duty to find [the 
defendant] guilty if the government proved beyond a reasonable doubt every element of the offense 
with which he was charged" (internal citation omitted)). 
None of Thomas's proffered excuses relate to proving or rebutting the elements of a 
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 100I(a)(3) as they do not concern whether a writing or entry was false, 
whether it was material to a matter within the jurisdiction of the BOP, or whether he knowingly 
EFTA00027323
--- PAGE 18 ---
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT Document 35 Filed 04/24/20 Page 18 of 34 
and willfully made a false statement. Nor are those excuses relevant to whether Thomas had a 
criminal agreement with his co-defendant. Indeed, evidence as to a defendant's purportedly 
innocent motive in a false statement case is irrelevant to the question of intent. See United States 
v. Washington, 705 F.2d 489, 493-94 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (holding that proof of a good or innocent 
motive is not probative of intent where the mens rea is "knowingly and willfully"); In re Terrorist 
Bombings of U.S. Embassies in E. Africa, 552 F.3d 93, 154 n.49 (2d Cir. 2008) (citing Washington, 
705 F.2d at 493, for "the irrelevance of a motive to the question of whether conduct is intentional"); 
United States v. George, 786 F. Supp. 56, 64 (D.D.C. 1992) (rejecting the defendant's "context 
argument" for why materials could be relevant to the crime charged). 
For the same reasons, "other people were doing it" is not a defense to a false statements or 
conspiracy charge because the conduct of other BOP employees is irrelevant to each of the 
foregoing elements. Thomas argues that because he was aware of incidents where BOP employees 
falsified records and "their conduct did not lead to their indictment or incarceration," evidence of 
what other BOP employees have done is relevant to his intent. (Mot. 6.) Not so. Whether Thomas 
believed falsifying records was illegal or was subject to criminal penalties is not relevant to the 
charges against him. See United States v. Southland Corp., 760 F.2d 1366, 1372 (2d Cir. 1985) 
("Ignorance of the law is no defense to a charge of purposeful and intentional action."); United 
States v. Rosenfield, 469 F.2d 598, 601 n.2 (3d Cir. 1972) ("As long as the inexcusable intent is 
present, it is not necessary that the defendant know that his conduct is subject to criminal 
penalties."). And in any event, it would be fundamentally inappropriate, and extremely prejudicial, 
for the jury to consider other individuals not on trial or otherwise relevant to the conduct charged 
here, in evaluating the guilt or innocence of the defendant. See United States v. Gibbons, 602 F.2d 
1044, 1048 (2d Cir. 1979) (approving instruction that jury was not to consider individuals who 
EFTA00027324
--- PAGE 19 ---
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT Document 35 Filed 04/24/20 Page 19 of 34 
were not on trial). 
Thomas's efforts to garner sympathy, put the Government on trial, and deflect blame for 
his own criminal actions plainly sound in nullification. See Reese, 933 F. Supp. 2d at 583-84; 
Levi,:, 2016 WL 2990831, at *12. Evidence on those points does not relate to whether the 
defendant committed the crimes charged, but rather is intended to elicit sympathy, compassion, or 
compromise from the jury. The records Thomas seeks are no more discoverable than the 
nullification evidence precluded in Armstrong and its progeny. See Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 462-
(defendant not entitled to discovery on race of other narcotics defendants to aid in selective 
prosecution claim); United States v. Delacruz, No. 14 Cr. 815 (KBF), 2015 WL 2211943, at *4 
(S.D.N.Y. May 12, 2015) (rejecting defendant's "demands for general information and statistics 
relating to the Government's use of sting operations"); United States v. Floyd, No. 99 Cr. 0234 
(DAB), 1999 WL 476438, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. July 7, 1999) (rejecting discovery request for 
"background data, records and investigative reports" of the New York City Police Department 
("NYPD") as well as information about NYPD officers' conduct in other cases); Defreitas, 2011 
WL 317964, at *10 (rejecting discovery demands related to a "factual impossibility" defense to a 
conspiracy charge). It is the Court's "duty to forestall or prevent" jury nullification. Manzano, 
945 F.3d at 627 (holding that "District courts have a duty to forestall or prevent [jury nullification 
arguments] and the district court in this case abdicated its duty by ruling that defense counsel could 
argue jury nullification."); see also United States v. Rosado, 728 F.2d 89, 93 (2d Cir. 1984) 
(criticizing trial court for inviting nullification by permitting the defendants to mount a "political 
defense" and stating that it was an "erroneous assumption that good motive for committing a crime 
is inconsistent with criminal intent"). 
In sum, much of the additional discovery Thomas seeks in his motion relates to legally 
EFTA00027325
--- PAGE 20 ---
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT Document 35 Filed 04/24/20 Page 20 of 34 
irrelevant matters, such as what "led" him to the criminal conduct or the broader "context" in 
which he committed specific criminal acts. There is no basis to compel production of evidence 
related to those matters under Rule 16, Brady, or Giglio because they are not material and because 
the evidence sought is in furtherance of a transparent attempt at nullification. Thomas's motion 
should be denied on this basis alone. 
C. 
The Government is Not Required to Collect Materials From Agencies Who 
Were Not Part of the Prosecution Team 
Thomas asks the Court to compel the Government to produce "any reports, witness 
statements, memorandum, and documents from any separate investigation conducted by the 
BOP," "documents, reports, witness statements and disciplinary records of any and all MCC 
employees who have engaged in the same or similar conduct," and any previously undisclosed 
reports, witness statements, and documents created by "any other federal agencies that investigated 
the circumstances surrounding the death of Jeffrey Epstein." (Mot. 4, 7 (emphasis added)). Even 
if Thomas had satisfied the materiality requirement under Rule 16 or Brady with respect to these 
items—and he has not—Thomas's motion would still fail because the materials he seeks are not 
in the prosecution team's possession. 
The BOP is not, and never has been, part of the prosecution team. Nor did the BOP conduct 
an investigation jointly or in coordination with the prosecution team.6 To require the Government 
to obtain and produce any records from the BOP from a separate investigation, as well as evidence 
that would support Thomas's purported (and improper, for the reasons discussed in Part II.B, 
The defendant claims, based on a CNN article, that the U.S. Marshal Service ("USMS") 
conducted an investigation. The Government is unaware of such an investigation, and in any 
event, any such inquiry by the USMS was not conducted jointly or in coordination with the 
prosecution team.

supra) defenses, is not legally required and would impose a nearly insurmountable obligation on 
the Government of marshaling and reviewing information and data in the possession of an entirely 
separate entity. 
1. 
Applicable Law 
As described above, Rule 16, Brady, and Giglio apply to materials in the Government's 
"possession." As a general matter, while "[lin individual prosecutor is presumed . . . to have 
knowledge of all information gathered in connection with his office's investigation of the 
case, . . . knowledge on the part of persons employed by a different office of the government does 
not in all instances warrant the imputation of knowledge to the prosecutor." United States v. 
Avellino, 136 F.3d 249, 255 (2d Cir. 1998) (citations omitted). The imposition of such "an 
unlimited duty on a prosecutor to inquire of other offices not working with the prosecutor's office 
on the case in question would inappropriately require us to adopt a monolithic view of government' 
that would `condemn the prosecution of criminal cases to a state of paralysis." Id. (citation & 
quotation marks omitted); see also Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 437 (1995) (Government's 
discovery and disclosure obligations extend only to information in the custody of the prosecutor 
or "others acting on the government's behalf in the case"). Thus, discovery and disclosure 
obligations only extend "information known to persons who are a part of the `prosecution 
team' ... who perform investigative duties or make strategic decisions about the prosecution of 
the case," including "police officers and federal agents who submit to the direction of the 
prosecutor and participate in the investigation." United States v. Barcelo, 628 F. App'x 36, 38 (2d 
Cir. 2015) (citation omitted). Brady is not a basis to compel the Government to gather information 
in the possession of third parties on behalf of the defense. See United States v. Yousef, 327 F.3d 
EFTA00027327

Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT Document 35 Filed 04/24/20 Page 22 of 34 
56, 112 (2d Cir. 2003) (defendants were not deprived of due process by any alleged failure of U.S. 
government to help them obtain cooperation from foreign authorities). 
In considering whether Rule 16 and Brady apply to records in the possession of another 
government agency, a prosecutor's duty extends to reviewing such evidence only where the 
Government conducts a "joint investigation" with that agency or branch of government. See 
United States v. Rigas, 583 F.3d 108 (2d Cir. 2009) (affirming district court opinion holding that 
there was "no joint investigation with the [Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC")]" and 
therefore the Government did not need to produce documents in the custody of the SEC); United 
States v. Blaszczak, 308 F. Supp. 3d 736, 742-43 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (holding that the Government 
was not obligated to review SEC material for Brady where SEC was not involved in grand jury 
presentation, did not attend every interview, did not review documents gathered only by 
prosecution, and did not develop prosecutorial strategy); United States v. Middendorf, No. 18 Cr. 
(JPO), 2018 WL 3956494, at *4-5 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 17, 2018) (holding that the Government was 
not required to conduct a search because the [Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 
("PCAOB")] was not involved in witness interviews or developing prosecutorial strategy, and the 
SEC was not involved in the grand jury presentation, reviewing the fruits of the Government's 
investigation, or developing prosecutorial strategy); United States v. Collins, 409 F. Supp. 3d 228, 
241-42 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (no joint investigation between Government and SEC); United States v. 
Finnerty, 411 F. Supp. 2d 428, 433 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (Chin, J.) (no joint investigation between 
Government and New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE")); United States v. Upton, 856 F. Supp. 
727, 749-50 (E.D.N.Y. 1994) (holding that USAO and Federal Aviation Administration ("FAA") 
did not conduct a "joint investigation" even though the FAA provided two inspectors to assist the 
criminal investigation). 
EFTA00027328

Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT Document 35 Filed 04/24/20 Page 23 of 34 
Moreover, even where agents from a component of an agency are involved in an 
investigation, that does not render the entirety of an agency part of the prosecution team. See, e.g., 
United States v. Stein, 424 F. Supp. 2d 720, 723 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) ("While the prosecution's [Rule 
16] disclosure obligation in some circumstances may extend to materials beyond the knowledge 
of the individual prosecutors assigned to a case, it does not extend to the collective knowledge of 
the entire United States government or even to the entire government agency concerned."); United 
States v. Pelullo, 399 F.3d 197, 218 (3d Cir. 2005) ("[T]hat other agents in the ([Department of 
Labor ("DOL")] participated in this investigation does not mean that the entire DOL is properly 
considered part of the prosecution team."); see also United States v. Locascio, 6 F.3d 924, 949 (2d 
Cir.1993) (refusing, for Brady purposes, to impute to AUSAs prosecuting that action with the 
assistance of certain FBI agents knowledge of reports prepared by FBI agents who were 
"uninvolved in the investigation or trial of the defendants"); but see United States v. Ghailani, 687 
F. Supp. 2d 365, 372 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (holding that, in the context of a speedy trial motion, other 
members of the Department of Justice who were involved in making decisions about timing and 
progress of the case were part of the "government" for Rule 16 purposes). 
Thus, as the foregoing precedents recognize, the factors relevant in determining whether 
an agency or a component of an agency are part of the prosecution team, and therefore their records 
are in the "possession" of the Government include whether the agency or component: "(1) 
participated in the prosecution's witness interviews, (2) was involved in presenting the case to the 
grand jury, (3) reviewed documents gathered by or shared documents with the prosecution, (4) 
played a role in the development of prosecutorial strategy, or (5) accompanied the prosecution to 
court proceedings." Middendwf, 2018 WL 3956494, at *4.

2. 
Discussion 
As described above, the Government has produced Brady, Giglio, and Rule 16 material in 
the possession of the prosecutors and agents at the United States Attorney's Office, the FBI, and 
the DOJ-OIG who have worked on this investigation and prosecution. Thomas seeks materials 
that are not in the possession of the United States Attorney's Office or the case teams at the FBI 
and DOJ-OIG who worked on this criminal investigation. 
Thomas seeks a variety of records from the BOP. The BOP was not a member of the 
prosecution team, and no employee of the BOP performed investigative duties or made strategic 
decisions about the prosecution of the case. Indeed, the Government obtained records from the 
MCC (a component of the BOP) pursuant to a grand jury subpoena to the institution and written 
requests to the MCC's legal department. Likewise, the Government was not involved in any 
internal BOP investigation into the circumstances surrounding Epstein's suicide. Notwithstanding 
those facts, the defendant asserts that the BOP is "allied with the prosecution" and therefore the 
Government's discovery and disclosure obligations extend to materials exclusively in the 
possession of the BOP. That argument is not only belied by the facts, but it is settled law in this 
Circuit that a prosecutor's duty extends to reviewing the materials in the possession, custody, or 
control of another agency for Brady evidence only where the Government conducts a "joint 
investigation" with that agency. None of the indicia of a "joint" or "allied" prosecution, as 
discussed in the foregoing case law, is present here. A straightforward application of those factors 
considered by courts in this Circuit reveals that the investigation was in no way joint: the BOP did 
not participate in the prosecution's witness interviews; it was not involved in presenting the case 
to the grand jury; no BOP employees aided in the review of documents gathered by the 
EFTA00027330
--- PAGE 25 ---
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT Document 35 Filed 04/24/20 Page 25 of 34 
Government; the BOP was not involved in the strategic decisions; and no BOP personnel 
accompanied the prosecution to court proceedings. 
Moreover, even if the BOP had conducted a joint investigation with the Government into 
the events of August 9 and 10, 2019 (which they did not), Thomas has offered no reason to believe 
that most if not all of the records that he seeks-such as records of other instances of BOP 
employees failing to conduct rounds and counts—would be part of the BOP's investigation. There 
is simply no basis to seek an order compelling the Government to search for records in the 
possession of the BOP, without any temporal limitation or factual nexus to the charged case, 
regarding staffing shortages at the MCC, other instances where BOP employees failed to conduct 
required rounds and counts, and disciplinary records for other BOP employees who have at other 
times also allegedly falsified records. 
The cases Thomas cites do not support a contrary result. In United States v. Biyan, the 
Ninth Circuit concluded that the government could not limit its discovery obligations to documents 
located in the district of prosecution since the case came out of a single, nationwide IRS 
investigation. 868 F.2d 1032, 1035-37 (9th Cir. 1989). In reaching that holding, the Circuit 
explained that "a federal prosecutor need not comb the files of every federal agency which might 
have documents regarding the defendant" and that Rule 16's disclosure requirements are cabined 
to anything in the possession "of any federal agency participating in the same investigation of the 
defendant." Id. at 1036 (emphasis added). Similarly, in United States v. Volpe, 42 F. Supp. 2d 
204, 221 (E.D.N.Y. 1999), the court explained, in denying the defendant's discovery motion, that 
"[c]ourts have construed the term `government' . . . narrowly to mean the prosecutors in the 
particular case or the governmental agencies jointly involved in the prosecution of the defendant, 
and not the 'government' in general." And while the court in United States v. Libby, 429 F. Supp. 
EFTA00027331
--- PAGE 26 ---
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT Document 35 Filed 04/24/20 Page 26 of 34 
2d I, 9 (D.D.C. 2006), required the prosecutors to obtain records from the Office of the Vice 
President and the Central Intelligence Agency, even though those parts of government did not 
participate in the grand jury investigation, that holding was an outlier, which has never been cited 
by another court, and the decision itself has never been cited in this Circuit. 
Finally, even if such materials had any conceivable relevance to the charges at hand (which, 
as discussed above, they do not), asking the Government to conduct a broad canvassing of the 
BOP's records—including searching databases located out of state, reviewing large quantities of 
documents, attempting to pull archived records going back as far as 2005, and parsing through 
attorney work product—would be inordinately time consuming and burdensome for attorneys for 
the Government, which does not have custody of the files, is not familiar with the files, and knows 
of no effective way to search them. It would, as the Circuit warned against in Avellino, "condemn 
the prosecution of criminal cases to a state of paralysis." 136 F.3d at 255. Such a result is not 
legally required by Rule 16, Brady, or Giglio, and therefore Thomas's motion should be denied. 
D. 
Any Draft Inspector General Report is Not Subject to Disclosure 
Thomas argues that any report by the Inspector General and related materials must be 
produced because he speculates that such a report will address systemic issues at the BOP, 
including purported staffing shortages at the MCC. (Mot. 5,9-10). For the reasons set forth above, 
any draft Inspector General Report is not discoverable because the issues Thomas believes it will 
discuss are not material to the preparation of a valid defense, see Part II.B, and the draft reports, 
to the extent they exist, are protected from disclosure by the deliberative process privilege. While 
the prosecution team has had no involvement in writing the Inspector General Report, the 
Government understands that those attorneys from DOJ-OIG responsible for writing the Report 
have not yet completed a draft, and do not anticipate completing the Report in the near term. As 
EFTA00027332
--- PAGE 27 ---
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT Document 35 Filed 04/24/20 Page 27 of 34 
such, there are no drafts of the Report to disclose, and Thomas's motion can be denied on that 
reason alone. Moreover, Thomas's request for draft versions of the Report—which do not yet 
exist-fails for two additional reasons. 
First, drafts of the Inspector General's Report, which has not been completed and will 
likely make recommendations about reforms at the BOP, are protected from disclosure under the 
deliberative process privilege, which "covers 'documents reflecting advisory opinions, 
recommendations and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions 
and policies are formulated.'" Dep't of Interior v. Klamath Water Users Protective Ass 'n, 532 
U.S. 1, 8 (2001) (quoting N.L.R.B. v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132, 150 (1975)). The 
privilege is applicable in criminal and civil cases involving the government. See, e.g., United 
States v. Fernandez, 231 F.3d 1240, 1246-47 (9th Cir. 2000) (government's death penalty 
evaluation form and prosecution memoranda were shielded from discovery under the deliberative 
process privilege); In re Sealed Case, 121 F.3d 729, 737-40 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (indicating that the 
privilege applies to grand jury subpoenas); United States v. Frank, 8 F. Supp. 2d 253, 284 
(S.D.N.Y. 1998) (internal memoranda covered by privilege). "In order for the privilege to apply, 
the agency record at issue must be (1) an inter-agency or intra-agency memorandum or letter; (2) 
pre-decisional; and (3) deliberative." Nat'l Res. Def. Council v. U.S. Envtl. Prot. Agency, 954 F.3d 
150, 155 (2d Cir. 2020). "It is well-settled that draft documents, by their very nature, are typically 
pre-decisional and deliberative [because] Whey reflect only the tentative view of their authors; 
views that might be altered or rejected upon further deliberation by their authors or by their 
superiors." Color of Change v. U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., 325 F. Supp. 3d 447, 453 (S.D.N.Y. 
2018) (quoting Amnesty Intl USA v. CIA, 728 F. Supp. 2d 479, 518 (S.D.N.Y. 2010)). 
The Inspector General's Report is both pre-decisional and deliberative. A full draft has not 
EFTA00027333
--- PAGE 28 ---
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT Document 35 Filed 04/24/20 Page 28 of 34 
been completed, let alone reached a point where the final version will be disclosed to the public. 
It is also deliberative in that it will likely make recommendations about the BOP, and those 
recommendations will be under discussion within the Office of the Inspector General prior to being 
finalized and publicly announced. Internal deliberations are an important tool for agencies in 
reaching decisions, including recommendations in DOJ-OIG reports. The ability to have these 
discussions is important in identifying a broad range of policy and legal issues. Here, disclosure 
of any draft report or other work product related to the preparation of the Report will undermine 
the DOJ-OIG's ability to engage in meaningful discussions of the issues at the BOP relating to 
inmate security and staffing, among other topics, and will potentially stifle rigorous discourse on 
the issues. Accordingly, Thomas's motion should be denied for the reason that the materials 
sought are protected by the deliberative process privilege. Klamath, 532 U.S. at 9. 
Second, Thomas has offered no support for his contention that drafts of the Inspector 
General's Report itself (and any related work product)—as opposed to the underlying materials 
upon which the Report is based—are subject to disclosure. To the extent that the forthcoming 
Inspector General's Report relies on information gathered during the instant investigation and 
prosecution, those underlying materials—which focus primarily on the events of August 9 and 10, 
2019, the incarceration of Jeffrey Epstein, and related MCC records—have already been disclosed 
to the defendants. Thomas contends that those tasked with preparing the Report may "possibl[y]" 
have generated additional witness statements and "other information" that has not been produced 
by the Government to date. (Mot. 5). Thomas provides no support for such assertions besides 
mere speculation. The prosecution has inquired of the Washington D.C.-based attorneys who are 
preparing the Inspector General's Report. Based on those conversations, it is the prosecution's 
understanding that those attorneys have not conducted any additional interviews or otherwise 
EFTA00027334
--- PAGE 29 ---
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT Document 35 Filed 04/24/20 Page 29 of 34 
discovered any potential Brady material. As such, given that the prosecution has already produced 
in discovery all of the materials it provided to the DOJ-OIG attorneys preparing the Report, the 
underlying materials for the Report would be merely cumulative of information in the defendants' 
possession. Any analysis of those materials by the attorneys preparing the Inspector General's 
Report is not subject to disclosure pursuant to Rule 16 and cannot constitute Brady material. See 
United States v. Lewis, 35 F.3d 148, 150 (4th Cir. 1994) (noting generally that "nothing contained 
in [an] OIG report would ordinarily have been discoverable"). 
At bottom, Thomas has not cited a single authority requiring the production of a draft, 
unpublished report by an inspector general or related work product, and such production is not 
required by Rule 16, Brady, Giglio, or any other disclosure obligation. 
E. 
Thomas Has Not Carried His Burden With Respect to Discovery of Material 
in Support of a Selective Prosecution Claim 
Thomas seeks "information and statistics that show the conduct in which the defendant is 
being charged with a crime were . . . rampant throughout the BOP" and that the application of 
criminal laws to him is "possibl[y] discriminatory." (Mot. 7.) This request, which is effectively a 
demand for discovery in furtherance of a selective prosecution claim, should be denied not only 
for the reasons set forth in Section II.B, but also because Thomas has not made the requisite 
showing that is necessary to obtain discovery for a selective prosecution claim. Indeed, Thomas 
has failed to put forth any evidence that his prosecution was the result of discriminatory effect or 
discriminatory purpose. 
1. 
Applicable Law 
"A selective-prosecution claim is not a defense on the merits to the criminal charge itself, 
but an independent assertion that the prosecutor has brought the charge for reasons forbidden by 
the Constitution." Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 468. The standard to prove this defense is "a demanding 
EFTA00027335
--- PAGE 30 ---
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT Document 35 Filed 04/24/20 Page 30 of 34 
one," id., as the defendant must "overcome the strong presumption of regularity on the part of 
federal prosecutors, and 'in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, courts presume that they 
have properly discharged their official duties."' United States v. Sanders, 17 F. Supp. 2d 141, 144 
(E.D.N.Y. 1998) (quoting Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 464), aff'd, 211 F.3d 711 (2d Cir. 2000). 
A defendant claiming selective prosecution must present "clear evidence" that the decision 
to prosecute not only (1) "had a discriminatory effect" but was also (2) "motivated by a 
discriminatory purpose." Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 465; United States v. Alameh, 341 F.3d 167, 173 
(2d Cir. 2003); United States v. Fares, 978 F.2d 52, 59 (2d Cir. 1992); United States v. Moon, 718 
F.2d 1210, 1229 (2d Cir. 1983). "The discriminatory effect prong requires a showing that 
`similarly situated individuals of a different [classification] were not prosecuted.'" Alameh, 341 
F.3d at 173 (quoting Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 465). In other words, the defendant must show that 
he has been "singled out" as a member of a protected class. Fares, 978 F.2d at 59 (quoting Moon, 
718 F.2d at 1229). To establish discriminatory purpose, the defendant must show that the 
Government's discriminatory "selection of the defendant for prosecution has been invidious or in 
bad faith, i.e., based upon such impermissible considerations as race, religion, or the desire to 
prevent his exercise of constitutional rights." Id. (internal quotation marks omitted; alteration 
incorporated). Where a defendant "has not shown that the Government prosecuted him because 
of his protected status or conduct, his claim fails. Id. 
In order to obtain discovery on a selective prosecution claim, the defendant must offer 
"some evidence tending to show the existence of the essential elements of the defense." 
Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 468 (quoting United States v. Berrios, 501 F.2d 1207, 1211 (2d Cir. 1974)); 
United States v. Bass, 536 U.S. 862, 863 (2002) (per curiam) (to obtain discovery, a defendant 
accordingly first "must show some evidence of both discriminatory effect and discriminatory 
EFTA00027336
--- PAGE 31 ---
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT Document 35 Filed 04/24/20 Page 31 of 34 
intent"); Fares, 978 F.2d at 59 (same). "[T]he showing necessary to obtain discovery should itself 
be a significant barrier to the litigation of insubstantial claims." Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 464. 
"Mere assertions and generalized proffers on information and belief are insufficient" to meet this 
burden. Fares, 978 F.2d at 59; see, e.g., Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 470 (affidavits "recount[ing] 
hearsay and report[ing] personal conclusions based upon anecdotal evidence" are not sufficient to 
justify discovery); Berrios, 501 F.2d at 1211 (affidavit from defendant and attorney that they 
"believe[d]" there was improper motive and that "hundreds" of similarly situated individuals went 
unprosecuted was insufficient); Alameh, 341 F.3d at 174 (defendant's statistical analysis was 
insufficient to merit discovery on selective prosecution claim). 
2. 
Discussion 
Thomas is not entitled to discovery that would relate to a selective procession or 
"discriminatory application" claim. He has not carried his burden through a showing of any 
evidence that his prosecution for the charges in the Indictment is discriminatory. 
As to the first required prong (discriminatory effect), Thomas has failed to put forth any 
evidence that "others similarly situated have not generally been proceeded against because of 
conduct of the type forming the basis of the charge against [him]." Fares, 978 F.2d at 59 (internal 
quotation marks omitted). "A similarly situated offender is one outside the protected class who 
has committed roughly the same crime under roughly the same circumstances but against whom 
the law has not been enforced." United States v. Lewis, 517 F.3d 20, 27 (1st Cir. 2008). Thomas 
alleges that there was an "almost identical incident in 2005 or 2006 wherein officers failed to 
conduct institutional counts or rounds and an inmate committed suicide," and one of the four 
officers involved was given a suspension. (Mot. 6). But Thomas is not charged with failing to 
conduct counts, he is charged with making false statements about those counts. Even assuming 
EFTA00027337
--- PAGE 32 ---
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT Document 35 Filed 04/24/20 Page 32 of 34 
those officers "in 2005 or 2006" did falsify count slips, Thomas has still not put forth any evidence 
that those officers were "outside of the protected class," meaning of a different race, gender, 
nationality, or other protected class than Thomas. In any event, even were the conduct similar, 
that Thomas can point to but a single other instance in which officers were not criminally 
prosecuted for that type of conduct hardly rings of selectiveness. 
Similarly, Thomas points to the fact that "Officer-1" and "Officer-2" in the Indictment, 
who falsified count slips along with Tova Noel for the 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. institutional counts on 
August 9, 2019, respectively, were not prosecuted. (Mot. 10; Ind. ¶¶ 15, 17, 19). Even assuming 
arguendo that Officer-1 and Officer-2 were similarly situated to Thomas in that they each falsified 
one count slip—while Thomas falsified three—Thomas has failed to put forth any evidence that 
either Officer-1 or Officer-2 were outside of a "protected class" to which Thomas belongs.' Nor 
could he: Officer-1 and Officer-2 are the same race, gender, and nationality as Thomas. Thomas 
also questions why his supervisors or other MCC personnel who received and reviewed Thomas's 
false count slips were not also prosecuted with making false statements, but those supervisors or 
personnel are not similarly situated to Thomas because they did not actually make the false 
statements—Thomas did. In addition, Courts have repeatedly held that the "suspicion [and] 
surmise" contained in Thomas's motion simply do not constitute "objective evidence" warranting 
discovery. See United States v. White, 972 F.2d 16, 19 (2d Cir. 1992) (conclusory allegations as to 
timing of indictment, Government's failure to follow internal guidelines, and improprieties of 
In so noting, the Government does not intend to comment on its deliberative process or 
the exercise of its prosecutorial discretion. It notes these facts simply in response to Thomas's 
claim that the lack of charges against Officer-1, Officer-2, or Thomas's supervisors is in and of 
itself sufficient to meet the defendant's burden of establishing evidence of a similarly situated 
defendant who was not charged.

prosecutors not "objective evidence" warranting discovery); Moon, 718 F.2d at 1230 ("to engage 
in a collateral inquiry respecting prosecutorial motive, there must be more than mere suspicion or 
surmise"). Thomas's failure to make an evidentiary showing in support of the first required prong 
means that his motion for discovery on his selective prosecution claim must be denied. See, e.g., 
Bass, 536 U.S. at 863. 
As to the second required prong, Thomas has failed to even allege, let alone establish, that 
the decision to prosecute him was motivated by a discriminatory purpose. To make such a 
showing, a defendant must establish that the Government's "selection of the defendant for 
prosecution has been invidious or in bad faith, i.e., based upon such impermissible considerations 
as race, religion, or the desire to prevent his exercise of constitutional rights." Fares, 978 F.2d at 
(internal quotation marks omitted; alteration incorporated). Thomas has not put forth any 
evidence whatsoever that the Government's decision to prosecute Thomas was based on anything 
other than his guilt. Instead, Thomas challenges the Government's decision to prosecute him at 
all, based on his wholly unsupported claim that the criminal conduct with which he is charged is 
"rampant" within the BOP. (Mot. 7). But the mere fact that other people were not prosecuted for 
committing the crime that Thomas committed does not mean that the Government harbored 
discriminatory intent in prosecuting Thomas's
Even if Thomas had not failed to carry his burden on his discovery motion (and he has 
failed), he would still not be entitled to put such evidence or argument regarding selective 
prosecution before a jury because the "selective prosecution defense is an issue for the court rather 
than the jury." Regan, 103 F.3d at 1082. The Second Circuit's directive makes sense. A claim of 
improper prosecutorial motive, whatever its ground or grounds, "is not a defense on the merits to 
the criminal charge itself, but an independent assertion that the prosecutor has brought the charge 
for reasons forbidden by the Constitution." Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 463. Instead, it is self-
evidently "unrelated to factual innocence of the crime charged," which is the sole issue to be 
decided by the jury, and, as a result, the Court alone must resolve a claim of selective prosecution. 
Regan, 103 F.3d at 1082; see also United States v. Rosado, 728 F.2d 89, 93 (2d Cir. 1984)

Having failed to meet the "rigorous standard" required to obtain discovery on a selective 
prosecution defense, Thomas's requests for discovery of any materials related to other incidents 
in which officers were not prosecuted for falsifying count slips should be denied. Armstrong, 517 
U.S. at 464. 
CONCLUSION 
For the foregoing reasons, the defendant's motion to compel should be denied.

reasonable doubt into a wide-ranging inquiry into matters far beyond the scope of legitimate issues 
in a criminal trial"). Accordingly, courts routinely and correctly preclude defendants from raising 
these arguments at trial. See Regan, 103 F.3d at 1082 ("[W]e agree with the district court's 
decision to resolve for itself whether the government's conduct was lawful and to prevent Regan 
from presenting evidence on that subject."); United States v. Raniere, No. 18 Cr. 204 (NGG), Dkt.

Stewart, Cr. No. 03-717 (MGC), 2004 WL 113506, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 26, 2004) (granting 
motion to preclude the defendant from "presenting arguments or evidence that would invite the 
jury to question the Government's motives in investigating and indicting" the defendant); United 
States v. Larkin, No. 12-CR-319, 2017 WL 928915, at *3 (D. Nev. Mar. 8, 2017) ("Defendant will

She is willing to commit to testify but she definitely wants her husband and children with her when in NY for trial in July. 
While she does not presently have the ability to finance her family's travel at this time, she might be willing and able to

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
United States of America, 
—v—
Ghislaine Maxwell, 
Defendant.

DATE FILED: 3/22/21 
20-CR-330 (MN) 
ORDER 
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell has been indicted by a grand jury on charges of conspiracy 
to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; enticing a 
minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2; conspiracy 
to transport minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; transporting 
minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2423 and 2; and two charges 
of perjury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1623. 
On July 14, 2020, the Court held a lengthy bail hearing and concluded that the Defendant 
was a clear risk of flight and that no conditions or combination of conditions would ensure her 
appearance. It therefore denied bail. On December 8, 2020, the Defendant filed a renewed 
motion for release on bail pending trial, which was entered into the public docket on December 
14, 2020. Dkt. No. 96. On December 28, 2020, the Court denied that motion, concluding that 
the Defendant posed a risk of flight and that no combination of conditions could ensure her 
appearance. Dkt. Nos. 104, 106. 
The Defendant then filed a third motion for release on bail on February 23, 2021. Dkt. 
No. 160. In this motion, the Defendant attempts to respond to the reasons that the Court 
EFTA00027360

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 169 Filed 03/22/21 Page 2 of 12 
provided in denying bail, proposing two additional conditions to the ones she proposed in her 
second motion for bail. Specifically, she offers to renounce her French and British citizenship, 
and she also proposes to have her and her spouse's assets placed in a new account that will be 
monitored by a retired federal judge. See Dkt. No. 160 at 2. 
As set forth below, the Court concludes that none of the Defendant's new arguments and 
proposals disturb its conclusion that the Defendant poses a risk of flight and that there are no 
combination of conditions that can reasonably assure her appearance. Thus, for substantially the 
same reasons that the Court denied the Defendant's first and second motions for release, the 
Court DENIES the Defendant's third motion for release on bail. 
I. 
Background 
On July 14, 2020, this Court held a hearing regarding the Defendant's request for bail. 
After a thorough consideration of all of the Defendant's arguments and of the factors set forth in 
U.S.C. § 3142(g), the Court concluded that no conditions or combination of conditions could 
reasonably assure the Defendant's appearance, determining as a result that the Defendant was a 
flight risk and that detention without bail was warranted under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(1). The 
Defendant has been incarcerated at the Metropolitan Detention Center since that time. 
The Defendant renewed her motion for release on bail on December 8, 2020. The Court 
again denied the Defendant's motion. In doing so, the Court explained that none of the 
Defendant's new arguments materially impacted its conclusion that the Defendant posed a risk of 
flight. It noted that the charges, which carry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry 
lengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence proffered by the Government, 
including multiple corroborating and corroborated witnesses, remained strong; the Defendant's 
substantial resources and foreign ties created considerable uncertainty and opportunities for 
EFTA00027361
--- PAGE 3 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 169 Filed 03/22/21 Page 3 of 12 
escape; and that the Defendant's lack of candor regarding her family ties and financial situations 
raised serious doubts as to her willingness to comply with any conditions imposed by the Court. 
See Dkt. No. 106. 
On February 23, 2021, the Defendant filed a third motion for release on bail. Dkt. No. 
160 ("Def. Mot."). The Government opposed the Defendant's motion on March 9, 2021. Dkt. 
No. 165 ("Gov't Opp'n"). The Defendant filed her reply under temporary seal on March 16, 
2021. 
IL 
Legal Standard 
The parties dispute whether the divestiture of jurisdiction rule precludes this Court from 
granting the Defendant's third bail motion while Defendant's bail appeal is pending. See Gov't 
Opp'n at 2-3; Reply at 2-3; see also United States v. Rodgers, 101 F.3d 247, 251 (2d Cir. 1996) 
("As a general matter, 'the filing of a notice of appeal is an event of jurisdictional significance—
it confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests the district court of its control over 
those aspects of the case involved in the appeal.") (citation omitted). Under Rule 37(a) of the 
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, however, the Court unquestionably has authority to defer 
considering the motion, deny the motion, or state either that it would grant the motion if the court 
of appeals remands for that purpose or that the motion raises a substantial issue. Fed. R. Crim. P. 
37(a). Because the Court denies the Defendant's motion, it does not resolve the question of 
whether it would have jurisdiction to grant it. 
Pretrial detainees have a right to bail under the Eighth Amendment to the United States 
Constitution and under the Bail Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3141, et seq. The Bail Reform Act 
requires that a court release a defendant "subject to the least restrictive further condition, or 
combination of conditions, that [it] determines will reasonably assure the appearance of the 
EFTA00027362
--- PAGE 4 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 169 Filed 03/22/21 Page 4 of 12 
person as required and the safety of any other person and the community." 18 U.S.C. § 
3142(c)(1)(B). The Court may order that the defendant be held without bail only if, after 
considering the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g), the Court concludes that "no condition 
or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and 
the safety of any other person and the community." 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(1). 
After a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can 
reasonably assure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Bail Reform Act allows the 
Court to reopen the bail hearing if "information exists that was not known to the movant at the 
time of the hearing and that has a material bearing on the issue" of whether pretrial detention is 
warranted. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(0. The Court is not required to do so if it determines that any new 
information would not have a material bearing on the issue. See United States v. Raniere, No. 
18-CR-204I (NGG) (VMS), 2018 WL 6344202, at *2 n.7 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 5, 2018) (noting that 
"[als the court has already held one detention hearing, it need not hold another"); United States v. 
Havens, 487 F. Supp. 2d 335, 339 (W.D.N.Y. 2007) (electing not to reopen a detention hearing 
because the new information would not have changed the court's decision to detain the defendant 
until trial). In addition, the Court may also revisit its own decision pursuant to its inherent 
authority, even when the circumstances do not match § 3142(0's statutory text. See, e.g., United 
States v. Rowe, No. 02-CR-756 (LMM), 2003 WL 21196846, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. May 21, 2003) 
(noting that "a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence proffered on 
reconsideration was known to the movant at the time of the original hearing."); United States v. 
Petrov, No. 15-CR-66 (LTS), 2015 WL 11022886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2015) (noting the 
"Court's inherent authority for reconsideration of the Court's previous bail decision"). 
EFTA00027363

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 169 Filed 03/22/21 Page 5 of 12 
If, as here, there is probable cause to find that the defendant committed an offense 
specifically enumerated in § 3142(e)(3), a rebuttable presumption arises "that no condition or 
combination of conditions will reasonably assure" the defendant's appearance or the safety of the 
community or others. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(3). In such circumstances, "the defendant `bears a 
limited burden of production ... to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that 
he does not pose a danger to the community or a risk of flight.' United States v. English, 629 
F.3d 311, 319 (2d Cir. 2011) (quoting United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 
2001)); see also United States v. Rodriguez, 950 F.2d 85, 88 (2d Cir. 1991) ("[A] defendant must 
introduce some evidence contrary to the presumed fact in order to rebut the presumption."). 
Nonetheless, "'the government retains the ultimate burden of persuasion by clear and convincing 
evidence that the defendant presents a danger to the community,' and `by the lesser standard of a 
preponderance of the evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight.' English, 629 F.3d at 
319 (quoting Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436); see also United States v. Mardi., 782 F.2d 1141, 1144 
(2d Cir. 1986) ("The government retains the burden of persuasion [in a presumption case]."). 
Even when "a defendant has met his burden of production," however, "the presumption favoring 
detention does not disappear entirely, but remains a factor to be considered among those weighed 
by the district court." United States v. Mattis, 963 F.3d 285, 290-91 (2d Cir. 2020). 
III. 
Discussion 
The Defendant bases her third motion for bail on the Court's inherent powers to review 
its own bail decisions, arguing that the new conditions she proposes warrant reconsideration of 
the Court's earlier rulings. See Def. Mot. at 4. She also argues that the strength of the 
Government's case is diminished in light of the arguments she advances in her pre-trial motions, 
which are currently pending before the Court. Id. at 7. Having considered those arguments, the 
EFTA00027364
--- PAGE 6 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 169 Filed 03/22/21 Page 6 of 12 
Court's view has not changed. The Court again concludes that the Government has shown by a 
preponderance of the evidence that the Defendant presents a risk of flight and that there are no 
set of conditions, including the Defendant's third set of proposed conditions, that are sufficient to 
reasonably assure her appearance. The presumption in favor of detention, the weight of the 
evidence, and the history and characteristics of the Defendant all continue to support that 
conclusion. The Defendant's proposed conditions do not alter the Court's determination. 
A. The Court's assessment of the 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g) factors has not changed 
To begin with, the presumption in favor of detention continues to apply with equal force. 
See Dkt. No. 106 ("Dec. Op.") at 7—8. And though the Court again concludes that the Defendant 
has met her burden of production, the presumption "remains a factor to be considered among 
those weighed by the district court." Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436 (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at 
1144). The Court is mindful "that Congress has found that these offenders pose special risks of 
flight, and that `a strong probability arises' that no form of conditional release will be adequate 
to secure their appearance." Martir, 782 F.2d at 1144 (citation omitted). 
The Court's analysis of the 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g) factors also remains unchanged. 
Because the nature and circumstances of the offenses charged include crimes involving a minor 
victim, the first 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g) factor continues to weigh strongly in favor of detention. 
And the Court remains of the opinion that the Defendant does not pose a danger to any person or 
to the community. The fourth § 3142(g) factor thus weighs against detention. 
With respect to the second § 3142(g) factor, none of the Defendant's new arguments alter 
the Court's conclusion as to the weight of the evidence. The Defendant argues that the pre-trial 
motions "raise serious legal issues that could result in dismissal of charges, if not the entire 
indictment," and she contends that "[t]hese motions cast substantial doubt on the alleged strength 
EFTA00027365
--- PAGE 7 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 169 Filed 03/22/21 Page 7 of 12 
of the government's case and warrant granting bail on the conditions proposed." Def. Mot. at 7. 
Those motions became fully briefed one week ago and are now pending before this Court. The 
Government strenuously contests each of the motions and the Court has not yet adjudicated 
them. Without prejudging the merits of any of those pending motions and mindful of the 
presumption of innocence, the Court remains of the view that in light of the proffered strength 
and nature of the Government's case, the weight of the evidence supports detention. See Dec. 
Op. at 9-10. 
The Court's assessment of the Defendant's history and characteristics has not changed. 
See Dec. Op. at 10-16. The Defendant continues to have substantial international ties, familial 
and personal connections abroad, substantial financial resources, and experience evading 
detection. Id. at 10-11. And the Court's concerns regarding the Defendant's lack of candor 
regarding her assets when she was first arrested have also stayed the same. As the Court 
emphasized in its denial of the second motion for release on bail, the discrepancies between the 
information presented to the Court and to Pretrial Services in July 2020 and the information 
presented to the Court in December 2020 raised significant concerns about candor. See Dec. Op. 
at 16. There remains considerable doubt as to the Defendant's willingness to abide by any set of 
conditions of release. Id. While there continue to be certain mitigating circumstances cutting in 
the opposite direction, including the Defendant's family ties in the United States, these do not 
overcome the weight of the considerations that lean in favor of continued detention. 
As a result, none of the evidence or arguments presented in this third motion for bail alter 
the Court's assessment of the 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g) factors. While the fourth factor continues to 
favor release, the first three factors and the presumption of detention all support the conclusion 
EFTA00027366
--- PAGE 8 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 169 Filed 03/22/21 Page 8 of 12 
that the Defendant poses a significant risk of flight. Thus, the Court again concludes that there 
are no conditions of release that will reasonably assure her appearance in future proceedings. 
B. Pretrial detention continues to be warranted 
The thrust of the Defendant's argument in her third motion for bail is that the two new 
proposed conditions vitiate the Court's concerns regarding the risk of flight. The Defendant first 
offers to renounce her French and British citizenship. Def. Mot. at 2. And she also proposes to 
have most of her and her spouse's assets placed in a new account that will be monitored by a 
retired federal judge, who would function as an asset monitor and will have co-signing authority 
over the account. Id. Those conditions are offered in addition to the bail package she proposed 
in December. See Dec. Op. at 16-17; see also Def. Mot. at 2. The new bail package does not 
disturb the Court's conclusion that the Government has carried its burden of showing that these 
conditions are insufficient to mitigate the flight risks, and the Court again determines that no set 
of conditions—including the two new ones—can reasonably assure her future appearance. 
The Court begins with the Defendant's offer to renounce her French and United Kingdom 
citizenship. She notes that she can renounce her UK citizenship "immediately upon granting of 
bail," and she informs the Court that "[t]he process of renouncing her French citizenship, while 
not immediate, may be expedited." Def. Mot. at 4. As the Government notes, the offer is of 
unclear validity, and the relevance and practical impact of the renunciations is, at best, unclear. 
See Gov't Opp'n at 5. With respect to her offer to renounce her French citizenship, the Court is 
again confronted with dueling opinions on the correct interpretation of French law. The 
Government relies on the position of the head of the International Criminal Assistance Bureau of 
the French Ministry of Justice, who argues that "the fact that the wanted individual is a French 
national constitutes an insuperable obstacle to his/her removal," and that "[a]s long as said 
EFTA00027367
--- PAGE 9 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 169 Filed 03/22/21 Page 9 of 12 
nationality is assessed at the time the offense was committed, any loss of nationality subsequent 
to said offense has no bearing upon the removal proceedings and shall not supersede said 
assessment of nationality."' Gov't Opp'n, Ex. A at 2. The Defendant, meanwhile, relies on the 
opinion of a French legal expert who argues that nationality is assessed at the time of the 
extradition request. See Reply, Ex. A ¶ 11. The Defendant's expert concedes that there is no 
case law addressing this precise issue. Id. ¶ 21. 
Exacerbating the uncertainty is the fact that the relevant legal materials also lend 
themselves to multiple interpretations. For instance, Article 3(1) the Extradition Treaty between 
the United States and France of April 23, 1996 provides that "[t]here is no obligation upon the 
Requested State to grant the extradition of a person who is a national of the Requested State, but 
the executive authority of the United States shall have the power to surrender a national of the 
United States if, in its discretion, it deems it proper to do so. The nationality of the person 
sought shall be the nationality of that person at the time the offense was committed." See Reply, 
Ex. A ¶ 9 (emphasis added)). Article 694-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure similarly 
provides that "Extradition shall not be granted ... [w]hen the person claimed has French 
nationality, the latter being assessed at the time of the offense for which extradition is 
requested!' Id. ¶ 10; see also Gov't Opp'n, Ex. A at 2. Thus, there is considerable uncertainty 
as to the relevance of the Defendant's offer of renunciation of her French citizenship to her 
ability to frustrate, if not entirely bar, extradition. The Court's assessment of the risks largely 
' The Court cites the translated version of the letter, though the original letter is in French. 
Here, there are minor discrepancies between the two sides' respective translations. The 
translated letter from the Ministry of Justice cites Article 694-4 as reading, "When the individual 
claimed to have French citizenship, said citizenship having been assessed at the time of the 
offense on the basis of which removal is being requested." Gov't Opp'n, Ex. A at 2. 
EFTA00027368
--- PAGE 10 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 169 Filed 03/22/21 Page 10 of 12 
parallel those that the Court articulated when the Defendant proposed signing an extradition 
waiver. See Dec. Op. at 12-13. 
Similar doubts exist as to the Defendant's offer to renounce her UK citizenship. The 
Court is persuaded by the Government's arguments that even if the Defendant were to renounce 
her UK citizenship, she would still likely be able to delay or resist extradition from the UK. See 
Gov't Opp'n at 6-7. And for largely similar reasons, the Court again concludes that the 
proposed conditions do not meaningfully diminish the Court's concerns regarding the 
Defendant's ability to flee and to frustrate or impair any subsequent extradition attempts. The 
possibility that the Defendant could successfully resist or forestall extradition heightens the 
Defendant's incentive to flee. 
To summarize, the Defendant's willingness to renounce her French and UK citizenship 
does not sufficiently assuage the Court's concerns regarding the risk of flight that the Defendant 
poses. Considerable uncertainty regarding the enforceability and practical impact of the 
renunciations cloud whatever relevance they might otherwise have to the Court's assessment of 
whether the Defendant poses a risk of flight. See United States v. Cohen, No. C 10-00547 (SI), 
2010 WL 5387757, at *9 n.11 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 20,2010). And that same uncertainty—and the 
possibility that she will be able to successfully resist, or at least delay, extradition—incentivizes 
flight, particularly because of the Defendant's substantial international ties. 
Nor does the second proposed condition materially alter the Court's determination that no 
condition or combination of conditions can reasonably assure the Defendant's appearance. The 
Defendant proposes to have a retired federal judge provide oversight authority over her financial 
affairs, and, if granted, he would have the authority to restrain, monitor, and approve 
disbursement of assets requiring his signature. See Reply at 5. The Court continues to have 
EFTA00027369
--- PAGE 11 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 169 Filed 03/22/21 Page 11 of 12 
concerns about whether the full extent of the Defendant's assets have been disclosed in light of 
the lack of transparency when she was first arrested. But the Court assumes, for purposes of 
resolving this motion, that the financial report that it reviewed in December is accurate and that it 
accounts for all of the Defendant's and her spouse's assets. See Dec. Op. at 16-17. 
The monitorship condition does not reasonably assure the Defendant's future appearance, 
even when viewed in combination with the rest of the Defendant's bail package. The Defendant 
would continue to have access to substantial assets—certainly enough to enable her flight and to 
evade prosecution. These include the $450,000 that the Defendant would retain for living 
expenses and any future salaries for her or her spouse, along with other assets, including jewelry 
and other chattels, that are potentially worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. See Def. Mot. at 
5-6; see also Dkt. 97, Ex. O at 9. While those amounts may be a small percentage of the 
Defendant's total assets, they represent a still-substantial amount that could easily facilitate 
flight. When combined with the Court's weighing of the § 3142(g) factors and the presumption 
of detention, the Court concludes that the proposed restraints are insufficient to alter its 
conclusion that no combination of conditions can reasonably assure her appearance. 
If the Court could conclude that any set of conditions could reasonably assure the 
Defendant's future appearance, it would order her release. Yet while her proposed bail package 
is substantial, it cannot provide such reasonable assurances. As a result, the Court again 
determines that "no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the 
appearance of the Defendant, and it denies her motion for bail on this basis. 18 U.S.C. § 
3142(e)(1).

Good Afternoon Mr. 
& Ms.= 
We have never spoke directly. I have been told by my attorney I can speak to you since you are consider law 
enforcement. You emailed my attorney Mr. Robert Lewis. I am writing you to please do not under estimate Mr. 
Epstein's ability to leave the country as he is asking for bail. Mr. Epstein has an apartment in Paris and he has 
friends that have the private means of getting him out of the country. I am not saying this is going to happen, 
but I know first hand that Mr. Epstein is like a family member to my former employer. He is the godfather to 
their children and they will help him and vice versa. They call him uncle "F." Since this situation is now extreme 
there is no telling how much pressure Mr. Epstein might put on them to help him. As they say, "they do favors 
for each other," and this goes as far as giving each other money when needed as well as the use of their private 
planes and cars.

I represent 
a potential witness in your
 case. As you will recall, we spoke about Mr. 
back in March, when you reached out to see if Mr. 
would speak to you and we agreed that you could. 
Although you have not contacted Mr. = 
I thought you should know about some recent developments. 
For the last week or so the New York Times (Mike McIntire) has been aggressively reaching out to Mr. =, 
Jesse Rose this employment lawyer) and me (who represented him in the Maxwell case) by email andi , 
as 
wella 
to Mr. 
home twice. He is seeking our comments and information concerning the 
and 
Mr. 
testimony in the Maxwell case. 
According to McIntire, the Times is planning to run story on th 
and their ties to Epstein. It also appears 
that the Times has a copy of all or a portion of the deposition Mr. 
gave in the Maxwell case, which is 
troubling because it was subject to confidentiality in that case and, although the Second Circuit has ordered the 
unsealing of the summary judgment papers (which likely include references to Mr. 
deposition 
testimony), no mandate has issued or documents been unsealed. 
In addition, the Times tells us that a "representative" of the 
has told it that Mr. 
"lied" in his 
deposition. If a representative did that, it is both defamatory and breaches a non-disparagement provision in the 
M
i m
settlement agreement with Mr. 
. The Times also informs that flight documents purportedly do not 
corroborate certain portions of Mr. 
deposition. We do not have access to those flight documents, but we 
understand that Epstein's flight documentation is incomplete, if not materially inaccurate. Also pursuant to his 
settlement of his sil
ent dispute with the 
Mr. 
destroyed all of the documents he possessed 
pertaining to the 
which might corroborate some of his testimony, 
We have rebuffed the Times' entreaties because of confidentiality obligations 
has pursuant to a settlement 
agreement in the employment case and the confidentiality order in the Maxwell case, as well as his desire to 
avoid doing anything that would undermine your criminal prosecution. 
Should you need or want a copy of Mr. 
deposition transcript in the Maxwell case, we would provide it to 
you pursuant to subpoena. 
If you wish to discuss these matters, please do not hesitate to call. 
Best regards, 
Bob Lewis

Subject: Request to Produce Ghislaine Maxwell to 500 Pearl Street 
Hi M, 
Following up on our earlier conversation, defense counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell (USMS No. 
) has requested 
to schedule time for Maxwell and her attorneys to review physical evidence in the FBI's custody. The FBI and AUSAs are 
able to bring the evidence to the 500 Pearl proffer rooms in order for the review to take place there. Defense counsel 
have requested that the first day of review take place on Tuesday, April 13, 2021. Because there is a large volume of 
items to review, defense counsel expects that the review will take multiple days. They have requested that Maxwell be 
produced on April 13th and every day thereafter until the review is completed. 
Would it be possible to please have Maxwell produced on April 13th and every day thereafter until the review is 
complete? My best estimate is that the review will take four days, so Maxwell would need to be produced on April 13, 
14, 15, and 16. That said, it is always possible the defense will need more time, which would push into the next week. 
Thanks very much for your help.

Hi

We requested these from the BOP, and they provided a set of documents, which we then produced to defense counsel. 
We did not do a page by page comparison between the redacted set and the unredacted set, so we can't guarantee that 
they are "comprehensive." But we can provide you with what we have, assuming that there aren't any issues with us

I recall that at some point you requested a version of the Epstein FOIA documents from BOP without the translucent 
green watermark they put on the withheld documents. Do you have those saved down somewhere? Although the Court 
has not put in a specific order yet, I think it's likely that we'll need to produce documents without the translucent green

The beast has been slayed. 
I organized the files out of the jumble that they were brought to us in. A few things that 
probably be helpful to know: 
1. 
There were some commissary receipts/finance documents pertaining to Epstein's activity inside of prison. I didn't 
know where to put this so I left it outside of the folders but still inside MCC Recs 
2. 
In the MCC Regs folder, I put a few things: 
a. 
One file had inventory and then at the end some documents pertaining to daily key counts. I wasn't sure 
if these were different so I created a separate file for the key counts just in case (while also keeping them 
in the inventory file) 
b. 
The MCC training 06-06-19 & information file was confusing to me. It was massive and I couldn't tell 
whether or not I needed to separate anything out. 
Everything else should be pretty straightforward as to where it is located. Let me know if you need me to clarify anything 
or help any further.

Subject: RE: Checking in on Epstein FOIA Review 
Date: Wed, 28 Apr 2021 20:49:23 +0000 
Hi 
Thank you for the update! I think we're going to try for a 2-day extension, but because we're a little behind and there is no 
guarantee PAE will grant the extension, we are still going to need the review completed today. 
Thank you again!

Hi 
I will do my absolute best to get these reviewed today, but you may not get them until very late tonight. If it is possible to 
ask for an extension (you can blame me!), then that would probably make sense. 
Thanks,

Hi 
Sorry again to bug on this but, in part because of a few other developments in the case, I think BOP might have real 
trouble meeting the Friday deadline if we don't get the rest of the Tartoglione redactions to them today. I want to make 
sure we're still on track for that. If not, then I think we could try to get some small extension into next week for some 
portion of the documents, although I think this would annoy PAE. Unfortunately, under his rules, we'd have to make that 
extension request today (and I'd need to get the Times's position on it). I can make that happen if we need to, but I need 
to know soon if it's necessary. Please let me know if we're on track to have the Tartaglione review for the second half of 
the dots complete today, or if we need to consider other options. 
Also, if there is any portion finished and it can be easily sent my way, please do that so I can get BOP started on it. 
Thanks!

Hi 
Sorry to bug you on this, but for planning purposes I wanted to check in on the Tartaglione review of the second half of 
the Epstein FOIA documents. Can you share any sense of when your review will be complete? 
Thanks,

Forensic and clinical psychologist 
• 
Independent group psychotherapy practice for over 20 years; in addition to providing 
psychotherapy, also has done legal consultation; forensic evaluations; expert testimony in 
both civil and criminal matters 
• 
Most legal work involved some type of traumatic stress; in criminal arena, done battered 
women homicide cases; sometimes asked to opine on ways that violence in relationship 
might have impacted someone's behavior at time of crime (e.g., coercion) 
• 
In civil space, have evaluated numerous victims of sex abuse, typically by people in authority 
positions; both plaintiff and defense

• 
Recently testified in criminal trial in Massachusetts last year; only testified twice (only 
transcript for Mass. case; prior one was in rural courtroom that was not transcribed, about 
years ago); has also been deposed 
• 
Child sexual abuse — grooming: expertise with victims; in many forensic reports, particularly 
in civil arena, explain and describe grooming and offer examples of grooming process and 
how perpetrators target someone with prior vulnerabilities and exploit slowly overtime to 
build trust and attachment; someone could have a lot of prior vulnerabilities and might draw 
conclusion that current difficulties as adult are substantially related to child sex abuse; 
nature of betrayal and attachments 
• 
Delayed reporting: often common for number of reasons; sometimes people don't 
conceptualize relationship as abusive, may feel loved, may not understand being abused or 
exploited, may be shame or guilt; especially now, people aware that reporting is fraught with 
pain and hassle for victim; afraid won't be believed and personal life will be on display; 
sometimes too traumatized and think can't go through with it; number of factors that 
contribute to when report; if someone has had multiple experiences of not being supported 
by people who are supposed to take care of them, then why would they believe that 
reaching out to someone would be helpful for them if they even realize that they are in need 
of help

• 
Trauma bonding: not phrase Dr. Rocchio uses; use the word attachment instead of bonding 
but is same concept 
o In case testified about intimate partner violence, explained that intimate partner 
violence is relationship where primary dynamic is one of coercive control and power 
maintained by acts of sexual, physical, psychological abuse; abusive interactions 
interspersed with neutral and positive interactions, which function to maintain the 
connection and increase dependency and increase power and control of perpetrator 
o in intimate partner violence and child sexual abuse, great deal of dependency, even 
love and affection; use psychological tools (e.g., disassociation, denial) to try to block 
it/push away 
o to develop and grow kids need physical attention and contact, someone to think they 
are special; if perpetrator exploits that and gives child what need, children are 
resilient; creates trauma bond and interdependency 
• 
When someone is underage, child sexual abuse; can involve forcible rape but more typically 
one of coercion and attachment; have worked with rape survivors who are victims of more 
forcible attack as well as ongoing abuse 
• 
Complex trauma is repeated exploitation/abuse/violence/acts of omission and commission 
during developmentally vulnerable period of child's life; separate from PTSD (e.g., single 
incident rape); has experience in both 
• 
Incremental disclosure is very common; know memory is not video tape; whatever details 
are most salient and relevant to victim tend to be ones that get encoded, and then what gets 
moved into storage; details may blur together, but basic concept of what happened in most 
cases is remembered 
o Extraneous details often are not; would not expect traumatic memory to always be 
presented in same way with same detail each time; look for generally consistent 
detail 
o Incremental disclosure as start to reveal memories; sometimes become more 
comfortable and sometimes sparks more memories; psychological and memory 
process; know from research on memory of cases where people can have entire 
episodes of life and childhood that don't recall; people can have memories of things 
that did not happen but much less common

• 
Clinically have worked with people whose mothers were sexually abusive either 
independently or in conjunction with fathers; don't think has worked on forensic case where 
there has been a woman perpetrator of sexual abuse; literature is clear that women can be 
perpetrators of abuse 
• 
In clinical realm, if father sexually abused kid, mom who is not participating is non-offending 
parent; if both involved, they are both perpetrators; involvement in facilitating is still 
perpetrating behavior 
• 
Dr. Rocchio will let AUSAs know if lE victims reach out to Dr. Rocchio to assist in civil 
litigation

Will try to find out if judge was asked to rule if testified as expert for any of her depositions

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 335 Filed 09/03/21 Page 1 of 3 
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
United States of America, 
—v—
Ghislaine Maxwell, 
Defendant. 
USDC SDNY 
DOCUMENT 
ELECTRONICALLY FILED 
DOC 0: 
DATE FILED: 9/3/21 
20-CR-330 (MN) 
ORDER 
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
Defendant seeks the Government's "disclosure of the identities of the unnamed co-
conspirators alleged in the S2 indictment." Dkt. No. 331 at I. In its August 13 Opinion & 
Order, this Court noted that the Government had not objected to Defendant's two prior requests 
that the Government identify the unnamed co-conspirators. Dkt. No. 317 at 12 n.1; see also Dkt. 
No. 331 at 1. On August 18, 2021, the Government filed a letter stating that it "objects to any 
requirement that it provide an exhaustive list of co-conspirators, whether in a bill of particulars 
or otherwise ... absent further order of the Court." Dkt. No. 320 at 1. The Court concludes that 
the Government's objection comes too late as the Government had multiple opportunities to raise 
its objection before this Court issued its opinion. For this and the foregoing reasons, the Court 
concludes that at the same time that the Government discloses Jencks Act materials, the 
Government must also disclose to the Defendant the identities of all unnamed co-conspirators 
alleged in the S2 indictment to whom it will refer at trial. See United States v. Bin Laden, 92 F. 
Supp. 2d 225, 241 (S.D.N.Y. 2000). 
Even if the Court were to find that the Government had not waived its objection, it would 
find unpersuasive the Government's justifications for withholding this information. "In 
considering whether to grant a request for identification of unnamed co-conspirators, `the Court 
EFTA00027416
--- PAGE 2 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 335 Filed 09/03/21 Page 2 of 3 
must balance the risk of surprise to the defendant, which is enhanced if `there are a large number 
of co-conspirators and a long-running conspiracy' with legitimate law enforcement concerns, 
such as the potential danger to co-conspirators and the risk of compromising continuing 
investigations.'" United States v. Akhavan, No. S3 20-CR-188(JSR), 2020 WL 2555333, at *2 
(S.D.N.Y. May 20, 2020) (quoting United States v. Pinto-Thomaz, 352 F. Supp. 3d 287, 303 
(S.D.N.Y. 2018). 
The conspiracies charged are long-running, increasing the risk of surprise to the 
Defendant. See Akhavan, 2020 WL 2555333, at *2. Count Three charges Maxwell with a 
conspiracy running from 1994 to 2004 and Count Five charges a conspiracy running from 2001 
to 2004. Dkt. No. 187 9¶ 17, 23. And as the Court has previously found, Maxwell is likely able 
to determine the names of the alleged victims described in the Indictment due to the 
Government's extensive discovery, see Dkt. No. 207 at 20; however, this logic does not 
necessarily extend to the identities of alleged co-conspirators. See Bin Laden, 92 F. Supp. 2d at 
241. 
The Government argues that there is no risk of surprise because "it currently intends" to 
introduce the alleged co-conspirator statements of only two individuals. Dkt. No. 320 at 2. At 
the same time, however, the Government proffers that it "may change its view as it prepares for 
trial." Dkt. No. 320 at 2. The Court thus finds the Government's reassurance hollow and 
insufficient to ensure that the Defendant may adequately prepare her defenses. See Pinto-
Thomas, 352 F. Supp. 3d at 301-02. 
Moreover, the Government has not alleged that disclosure here would create "potential 
danger to co-conspirators" or risk "compromising continuing investigations." See Akhavan, 
2020 WL 2555333, at *2. It merely argues that disclosing the identities risks "harm to the 
EFTA00027417
--- PAGE 3 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 335 Filed 09/03/21 Page 3 of 3 
Government from restricting its proof at trial." Dkt. No. 320 at 3. The Government provides no 
explanation for this purported harm and none is apparent to the Court. Thus, the Court finds that 
this concern alone does not outweigh the risk of surprise to the Defendant in this case or the need 
for the parties to litigate co-conspirator issues in advance of trial to ensure the absence of delay. 
In light of the interests discussed above and consistent with other courts that have required 
disclosure of co-conspirator identities to the defense, the Court will require the Government to 
disclose the identities of any unnamed co-conspirators who allegedly participated in the 
conspiracies charged in the S2 indictment whom the Government intends to refer to at trial. 
Accordingly, the Court ORDERS that at the same time that the Government discloses 
Jencks Act material, the Government shall also disclose to the defense the identities of any 
unnamed co-conspirators who allegedly participated in the conspiracies charged in the S2 
indictment to whom the Government will refer at trial. The Government is FURTHER 
ORDERED to disclose all co-conspirator statements it intends to offer at trial no later than 
October 11, as consistent with this Court's scheduling order. Dkt. No. 297 at 1. 
SO ORDERED.

A. SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS IN CASES 
• 
US v. Ghislaine Maxwell USAO 2018R01618 (AUSAs 
: On June 29, 2020 a grand jury returned a six count indictment charging 
Maxwell for her role in facilitating Epstein's abuse of minor girls. Maxwell was 
arrested on July 2 at a residence in New Hampshire and has been detained since. 
The team made an initial discovery production on or about August 21, 2020, and is 
working on a second discovery production of electronic materials in the coming 
month. The team is also working with the USAO-SDFL, OPR and the West Palm 
Beach Police Department among other sources to obtain and review materials 
relevant to the prior investi ation. Additionally, the team is in the process of 
reaching out to counsel for 
to begin initial discussions about the possibility of 
a felony disposition. We are also continuing to pursue a potential interview with 
Prince Andrew, and after his counsel declined to make him available for a voluntary 
interview, we notified OIA that we wished to proceed with an MLAT. We 
completed discovery in November 2020. Maxwell expects to make a renewed 
bail application in the next weeks based in part on conditions at MDC and a 
substantial bail package. We expect to oppose.

Team, 
In preparation for our call (which we can reschedule to a time following the discovery deadline), I wanted to send around 
a list of topics to discuss for potential next steps. I'm sure I've missed some items, but this is a starting point at a least. 
For context, I think we currently expect to call at least the following witnesses at trial: 
>; 
• *Records custodian from Interlochen 
• *Records custodian from the Professional Children's School 
• *Court reporter(s) from GM depositions 
*We haven't identified/spoken to these witnesses yet, so that's on the trial prep to-do list as well. 
The following are some potential next steps — either individuals to interview or re-interview, records to search for/identify, 
and so forth. 
• Relativity review of GM emails 
• Identify an Interlochen employee (likely retired) who managed donor relations with Epstein/can authenticate 
documents 
• Identify a PBPD detective who can authenticate items recovered from search of PB house

Below is the text we would propose for a victim notification letter. We would plan to use VNS, and the letter is styled 
accordingly. One note: the letter does not expressly reference the CVRA, because other DOJ components are currently 
litigating whether the CVRA applies in the context of a pre-indictment plea (the issue is currently before the Eleventh 
Circuit, en banc). Since we're giving notice here regardless of whether it's required, because that's the right thing to do, 
there's no need to include language that touches on the CVRA issue.

Okay, let's do this — why don't you reach out to = 
and find out how long he thinks it will take him to do whatever 
conversion/processing needs to happen, once we deal with the drive issue and he gets the data. See what the answer is 
and what help he may need to get that done. 
I'm happy to elevate on the FBI side (and Russell and I put this issue on the radar of the new ASAC when we spoke to him 
on Monday), but let's get the answer from =first and then formulate the ask of CART as precisely as possible — do we 
want them to be devoting more resources to completing the extractions of all the data faster? Do we want them to be 
extracting in a different way? — before doing so.

Yeah it's complicated, but the answer is that it's not consistent with the call we had a few weeks ago — in that call, 
said that by June he would be able to give us the materials in a format that could be directly uploaded to Relativity. That 
is, he would take all the pst files, pdf files, word files, images, etc etc, from something like 50+ devices and drives, and 
convert all of those materials into TIFF documents with a load file (or something similar). That's how we ordinarily get 
large productions from law firms or sophisticated subpoena recipients, for example — so that they're in a format that's 
reviewable on one of a number of platforms, whether Relativity, Everlaw, Logikcull, etc. So we were expecting to get the 
full set materials, totaling terabytes of dots, in Relativity-upload-ready format as of June. 
Instead, the FBI is going to basically just give us copies of the original files from the collected devices and drives —
effectively the equivalent of a phone dump, or a copy of a hard drive. And we (or PAE, or another vendor) will have to 
convert the original files into a format that can be uploaded to Relativity. I think that CART will have stripped out useless 
files — system files, for example — but basically they're just sending us copies of what they gathered nine months ago, 
which I think they could have done in October or November, and the time (and cost) of preparing that data for review will 
be on our end. It's sort of like if I spent nine months working on what you expected would be a 300-page memo on a legal 
issue, and then instead sent you a list of a thousand relevant case citations. 
And the current delay is that FBI says they don't have hard drives to transmit the data, so = 
is in the process of 
obtaining or purchasing hard drives to send to 
. Then the data needs to go to = 
because = 
needs to figure out 
EFTA00027444

the volume of materials and determine how to best have the data processed, whether through PAE or another vendor, 
and to do QC to make sure we got the docs in a format that can be processed.

I'm not sure I follow — isn't 
email below, if not exactly friendly, consistent with the call we all had a few weeks ago, 
where we agreed that he needed to re-extract the non-media data so that it could be attributed to a source device, and 
then give it to =, 
so that I= 
could arrange to have it put in relativity? It sounds like, from his email, that he has now 
done that for "multiple devices" and needs to figure out a way to get them to

is working remotely? 
Since I think= just sends them to the POC at Relativity, could we skip the middle step and just have FBI send to 
Relativity directly?

Guys, to keep you updated on this, see below. One huge frustration on this case is that while we've been asked to pursue 
various evidence and interviews we don't expect to yield useful evidence, there is a *huge* trove of evidence that the FBI 
gathered nine months ago, that may very well contain important information, that we still haven't gotten a single 
functional production from. And it doesn't seem to be a significant priority above the line level either at the FBI or our 
office. Ultimately, after months and months of attempts to get this, the end result is that the FBI isn't going to process 
any of it after all — they're just going to dump the raw materials on us and we'll need to process it into loadable files 
ourselves, and get it up on Relativity, which will likely take additional months. I expect that we'll likely come back to you 
in June for permission to request significant funds for a vendor to do this correctly.

Respectfully, I think there are some miscommunications here — all we have asked is to receive the materials in a format 
such that we can view them using a system we have access to. We're not able to get web-enabled access through any FBI 
tool, so we asked for the materials to be transferred in a loadable format so we could put them on Relativity, which both 
we and the agents can access. We're required to have the files in a format that we can produce them to defense counsel. 
I've done that in many other cases and it hasn't previously been an issue. My understanding from =I is that the best 
way to do it now is just for us (the U.S. Attorney's Office) to get the original files, which our vendor will process—by which 
I just mean converting into file formats that are loadable onto Relativity. It doesn't really have anything to do with the 
taint review—we have to have access to the docs in our systems for discovery purposes. 
And we were happy to get the materials as they were processed, but when we received the 1.1 million documents earlier 
this year, they were in a format that wasn't usable for the reasons described in the email I sent on March 9. Again, I 
EFTA00027445
--- PAGE 3 ---
understand from =I that the best way forward is to just get copies of the materials in their original formats, which I 
understand will be segregated and designated by device. That should work for us! I was just trying to understand the 
approach, as well as the timeline. 
thanks,

Just to be clear. The US Attorney's Office (or it's contractors) are not "processing" anything. You are taking files 
that I will be extracting from processed evidence and putting them into an E-Discovery tool (Relativity) to do a 
taint review. 
Relativity is NOT a forensic tool. It is incapable of dealing with many things that are found forensically on a 
computer like free space, slack space, and system files to name a few. When we started this, and you insisted 
you do the taint review in Relativity, I warned you that it was adding months worth of work on top of what was 
already done, and that Relativity was incapable of viewing everything. You insisted we do it this way. So now 
and I have come up with a way to fit this round peg into this square hole. We will get it done. 
Sorry it has taken so long, but we are talking about terabytes worth of data over multiple forms of digital 
evidence. Phones, tablets, loose media, cameras, DVRs, servers, laptops, and desktop computers. We have 
gotten past encryption on multiple devices. When we review devices on such large cases, we usually do it piece 
by piece as things are processed, I was unaware that you didn't want to review as things were processed, that 
you wanted to do it "all at once", so that added to the delay. Sorry for that. Just a differentiation of 
methodology I suppose. 
and I feel confident that the method we have come up with will be more consistent and preserve the 
attribution of files to devices and links of e-mails to attachments that the load file generation that I did a while 
back was lacking.

Okay, so just to check, you both think that there is not a need to do a test run? You're both comfortable with just basically 
sending us copies of everything? I don't totally understand why we couldn't have done that eight months ago, but

regardless of the passage of time, I want to make sure we understand so we can report to our supervisors. I assume that 
means that we (at the U.S. Attorney's Office and through contractors) will therefore need to do all the processing 
ourselves, correct? And thanks again to you both.

Unfortunately I don't think this is very helpful to us. Did you take a look at the example spreadsheet I sent on 2/24? The 
excel file you sent has descriptions that don't match up to the items listed in the search warrant returns (that we sent on 
2/23), and we don't have the 1B or CART numbers to be able to cross-reference. We also can't tell what you mean by 
"loose media" without a specific comparison to what was seized, we don't know which items you're referring to as 
"Windows machines," and we can't tell whether the entirety of any particular item has been transferred, or just partial. 
For example, it looks like we have gotten very, very few image files, which is surprising. 
We have also encountered some very significant problems in trying to review the more than 1 million documents we 
recently received: 
The data we've received has no way to put any emails and attachments together. So if an email says, "see the 
attached flight records," for example, we have no way of linking that up with the records themselves. Not only is 
that a big problem for us in review, it's going to be a huge problem for producing the documents to defense 
counsel. 
The load file has no link to the native file, so when we load the data to the database, there's no way to have the 
native files show up in the database. Because many of the files are too large to open in the viewer, it effectively 
means that there are many files that are completely invisible to us. 
Related, the control numbers in the load file don't match up to the native files. So we have two sets of numbers 
and no way to match up anything—that is, even if we were to try to go hunt down every individual large file in the 
native files, it would be impossible. 
So the data that we most recently got, we need to get in a form that addresses those issues, and we likely will need to get 
a similar reproduction of the data we received a couple months ago. Otherwise we're sifting through more than a million 
documents without much rhyme or reason. 
I've re-attached the spreadsheet we sent last week — I think that's a good place to start in terms of our necessary record-
keeping, and we need that info at the very least, as well as anything else you think would be useful. Also attaching the SW 
returns for reference. And again, we're happy to meet up anytime and hash all this out in person if that's useful.

Here is a listing of what I have already handed over in load files to the US Attorney's Office for taint review. Some points of 
clarification: There were 9 IDE hard drives found in the Manhattan apartment, they turned out to be 3 copies of 3 drives 
(9 drives in total) from a July 2007 search on one of his properties. I only processed 3 (as they were all copies). All the 
loose media from the NY apartment is included. All the Windows machines from the NY apartment are included. Only 2 
Macs from NY and 1 from the Island are included. 
I will have to more closely coordinate with whoever is loading up Relativity with the remaining Macs as the tool 
they have to be processed with does not easily re-name the load files.

Totally understand about the network issues—we can relate. I do still think it will be helpful to all sit down together to 
have an in-person discussion, to make sure everybody is on the same page. Are folks available for that next week? And 
what I think would be most helpful to facilitate that would be a spreadsheet of each separate device referenced in the two 
search warrant returns, with columns for whether we've dumped the contents, whether they've been reviewed and/or 
transferred, what portions were transferred, etc. 
Something roughly like the attached, with any other categories you think would be useful — and the info on the attached is 
mostly hypothetical, obviously, just as examples. That will help us fully understand what's been reviewed, transferred, 
and received so far, and what remains. 
(Also just on the pictures, we do want copies of those as well, please including from the discs and the devices — I think FBI 
was going to do an initial screen to make sure no CP, and since I think the answer was no, we'll need to get those to be 
able to review them as well.)

Sony for the delayed response. They are tearing out our old network and giving us a new one, they mandated we 
delete old stuff (about 400 TB worth). Now that they are working on replacing the network, we can do only local 
work. I should be able to give you an accounting of what is what. I can say, off the top of my head, that all 
windows based items from the NY search have been handed over as well as all loose media. The CDs from NY 
only contained pictures, no documents. There are still some Apple items from NY that need to be produced. As 
far as the Island stuff goes, the 1st item on your spreadsheet, the "kitchen" mac has been produced. Still working 
on the rest.

Following up on the below from last weekend, I'm still not sure how we're addressing this so I thought it would make 
sense for us to all schedule a (hopefully relatively brief) meeting to all get on the same page? We didn't hear back on 
which files had previously been provided, but our tech folks did their best to differentiate, and we got access to the 
materials yesterday and its well over a million documents, and we don't have any idea what we're looking at — i.e., which 
devices the materials came from, whether it's full or partial results, how many more devices we have coming, etc. 
Based on the attached search warrant returns, it looks like from the New York mansion (the PDF) there are approximately 
devices that would have storage (computers, hard drives, thumb drives, etc.) and that's not even counting at least 60+ 
CDs. And then from the Virgin Islands (the Excel spreadsheet), at least more than 25 devices, including multiple servers / 
server racks. 
So we gotta know what we've already received, what remains, anticipated schedule, etc, and I know it's a lot of moving 
pieces on all sides so wanted to loop in everybody at once. The case team will be in California this coming week from 
Tuesday through Friday, but then I think generally around the first week of March, which will hopefully be plenty of time 
to schedule a productive meeting.

I'm not sure who's the exact right person to ask this, so wanted to get everybody on one email chain about it — I have the 
hard drive that 
dropped off that has new Epstein search warrant materials, but it looks like there are also old 
materials (that I think we had previously received and uploaded??) on the hard drive, and so I'm not sure what's new. 
Just generally, and 
and I talked about this last week too, but it's basically impossible for us to keep track of what 
we're getting, and what has been completed, without some kind of identification or labeling system, along with a list of 
which devices have been extracted and downloaded. 
So for example on the hard drive currently, there are 38 folders labeled "loadFiles" through "37loadFiles" with a modified 
date of 11/14/19, which I think we may have already previously received — but I'm not sure, because we haven't gotten 
any info on which folders match up to which devices, etc. And then there's another folder titled "NYC024362" that has a 
modified date of 1/27/20, so I think that may be the materials we hadn't previously received? That folder by itself has 
more than 600,000 items. 
I don't want to give 
anything that we've already previously received and uploaded, and I can't tell from the folder or 
file names whether everything on the drive is new, or whether just additional materials were saved onto it in addition to 
what we already have. =, 
are you able to give us some guidance on this? Ultimately what we really need is a 
spreadsheet of every device, whether it's been dumped (or partially dumped), and then identifying that same info —
which device, and what materials from it — are being given to us with each data transfer. Otherwise I think 
organizationally and for review purposes it will be a total disaster for us. 
We're happy to have a meeting on this if that's helpful — and thanks everybody for the assistance.

I spoke with the GC of OCME and she was very appreciative of the head's up. She asked whether we intended to provide 
notice to the family about the autopsy report's release, which is something they would normally do. As we discussed, 
we have not provided a head's up to the Estate given that they are on notice of the FOIA litigation. As you may recall, 
though, we met with Epstein's brother in the course of our investigation, and he is represented by Stacey Richman. 
After giving it some thought, I don't see much of a downside to giving Stacey a call on Friday to give her a head's up 
about the production of the autopsy report, which seems to be the human thing to do. Do you guys have any 
objection?

even to provide feedback on the proposed plan for the fund, and so they'd like the opportunity to elevate that

meaningful discussions about a possible resolution. When you've spoken with =, 
could you please let us know

GHISLAINE MAXWELL CHARGED IN MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURT FOR 
CONSPIRING WITH JEFFREY EPSTEIN TO SEXUALLY ABUSE MINORS 
Maxwell is Alleged to Have Facilita- ted, Participated in Acts of Abuse 
Additionally Charged With Perjury in Connection With 2016 Depositions 
Audrey Strauss, the Acting United States Attorney- for the Southern District of New York, William F. 
Sweeney Jr., the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation ("FBI"), and Dermot Shea, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department ("NYPD"), 
announced that GHISLANE MAXWELL was arrested this morning and charged with enticing a minor to travel 
to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, 
conspiracy to commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. The Indictment 
unsealed today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 through 1997, MAXWELL and co-conspirator 
Jeffrey Epstein exploited girls as young as 14, including by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the 
purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference for young girls, 
MAXWELL played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations 
including New York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, MAXWELL made several false 
statements in sworn depositions in 2016. MAXWELL is expected to be presented this afternoon in the in federal 
court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan.

Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated, aided, and 
participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then 
delivered them into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust. 
All the while, she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself. 
Today, after many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the 
most important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the 
law and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth into 
behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the quest for 
justice has been met with great disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. The 
example set by the women involved has been a powerful one. They persevered against the rich and connected, 
and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a subpoena - and they stood together. I have no doubt the bravery 
exhibited by the women involved here has empowered others to speak up about the crimes of which they've been 
subjected." 
NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said: "The heinous crimes these charges allege are, and always will 
be abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement 
partners, for their continuing commitment to bringing justice to the survivors of sexual assault, everywhere." 
If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, please contact 
the FBI at 1400-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
According to the Indictment[ I I unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated 
in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, 
which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies or 
taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at 
ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. 
Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to accept offers of 
financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. MAXWELL also 
normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, encouraging them to massage 
Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and 
susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between 
minor victims and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL 
was present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages 
during which a minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein 
involving a minor victim where MAXWELL was present. 
As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching 
of a victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to 
touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and 
EFTA00027467
--- PAGE 3 ---
Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as 
well as MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal 
sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to 
travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of 
transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, which carries a maximum sentence of 
years in prison, one count of conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual 
activity, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and two counts of perjury, each of which 
carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
The statutory maximum penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational 
purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be determined by the judge. 
Ms. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and the NYPD. 
This case is being handled by the Office's Public Corruption Unit. Assistant U.S. Attorneys 
and 
are in charge of the prosecution. 
The charges contained in the Indictment are merely accusations. The defendant is presumed innocent 
unless and until proven guilty.

Following up on the below, I think we've given this our absolute best efforts with FBI — they are now well over a month 
later than their estimate from April on when we would get the New York materials, they're also past their estimate of 
getting us the New York materials from just this Monday, and we don't have anything close to an estimate on the USVI 
materials, which constitute the overwhelming majority of the data and are vastly more voluminous than the New York 
devices. We have kept pushing the timeline back for this option, hoping that CART will finalize, but I think at this point 
we should have a vendor do it. 
Attached is an estimate we got from BRG, which would get everything to us in under a month, and in Relativity-friendly 
format, in a range of $85-135K. BRG has done this for our office multiple times in the past and are very effective and 
efficient, and they get the materials we need. And most importantly, they estimate they can do it all in less than a 
month. May we have approval to seek funding for this? The estimate is attached. Thanks very much.

You are getting both NY and USVI. The biggest stumbling block are the newer Mac items that are in APFS

I am in the process ofAtoorting the materials (documents, spreadsheets, emails, etc) for your review as per 
my discussions with =. 
Most of the NY stuff is done, just Mac items left. This might take a few days as 1 
item in particular has over 500,000 emails. We will be able to provide discovery once Defense Council has 
provided drives for us to copy items over to. This goes quicker as there is no processing involved. I'll let you 
know when everything is complete.

We are going every other day now, ramping up to 75% week after next. I need drives to put things on like 
and I discussed earlier. Once I have those drives, it will take me a couple days to copy stuff. LMK when 
I can expect the drives. Thanks.

Wanted to circle back on this and check in, particularly because we desperately need to get the results from the July 
and September searches before moving forward with possible additional charges in the case. I know you had 
mentioned you needed to push back your prior estimate of complete production by early June, by a couple weeks, so 
wanted to see what the current estimate is? I don't think we've started to get anything yet but please correct me if I'm 
wrong.

Thanks for this, it's a helpful start. In terms of being able to write our search warrant, one additional piece of 
information we need is the serial number, or some other specific identifier, ideally for each device but at least for any 
device that there is more than one of the same thing. So for example, we need to be able to somehow differentiate 
the following devices —
The two Dell power edge T310 hard drives (NYCO24323 and NYCO24324) 
The two Sony Vaio laptop / Fujitsu hdd (NYCO24336 and NYCO24337) 
the following loose storage devices: 
o Micro SD card (NYCO24339) 
o Flash Drive (generic) (NYCO24340) 
o Thumbdrive (Emtec) (NYCO24341) 
o hard drive (loose) (NYCO24342) 
o verbatim thumbdrive (NYCO24343) 
The four San Disk cruzer-thumbdrives (NYCO24344-47) 
The three Seagate IDE hard drives (NYCO24348-50) 
The camera SD card (NYCO24351) 
I think the rest of the devices are either specifically distinguishable and/or have an S/N listed. (By comparison, the 
USVI spreadsheet we have lists an s/n for about 20 of the 25(ish) devices. 
The other thing we're looking for is the location in the house (and ideally specific location) for each device, which the 
USVI list also has — is that info available? 
The list also has just five devices as still pending to be transferred to us, and I think it's right that the plan is to 
reproduce all the materials so that we can get them in searchable format, but just wanted to confirm? Currently, we 
aren't able to match any of the prior productions to specific devices — so if we're able to match them up by Bates

unique numbers CART NY uses fro their evidence. The template wasn't a slam dunk over, so I did what I 
could to convey the information. If you are confused by anything, please let me know. In the column for 
approximate size, it is in GB, totaled at the bottom and converted to TB. In the materials contained column, I 
put what load file group the data was transferred over in (Mac, Windows, Loose Media, IDE, or Blacklight) If

Respectfully, I think there are some miscommunications here — all we have asked is to receive the materials in a format 
such that we can view them using a system we have access to. We're not able to get web-enabled access through any 
FBI tool, so we asked for the materials to be transferred in a loadable format so we could put them on Relativity, which 
both we and the agents can access. We're required to have the files in a format that we can produce them to defense 
counsel. I've done that in many other cases and it hasn't previously been an issue. My understanding from 
is 
that the best way to do it now is just for us (the U.S. Attorney's Office) to get the original files, which our vendor will 
process—by which I just mean converting into file formats that are loadable onto Relativity. It doesn't really have 
anything to do with the taint review—we have to have access to the docs in our systems for discovery purposes. 
And we were happy to get the materials as they were processed, but when we received the 1.1 million documents 
earlier this year, they were in a format that wasn't usable for the reasons described in the email I sent on March 9. 
Again, I understand from 
that the best way forward is to just get copies of the materials in their original formats, 
which I understand will be segregated and designated by device. That should work for us! I was just trying to 
understand the approach, as well as the timeline.

Just to be clear. The US Attorney's Office (or it's contractors) are not "processing" anything. You are taking 
files that I will be extracting from processed evidence and putting them into an E-Discovery tool (Relativity) 
to do a taint review. 
Relativity is NOT a forensic tool. It is incapable of dealing with many things that are found forensically on a 
computer like free space, slack space, and system files to name a few. When we started this, and you insisted 
EFTA00027481
--- PAGE 9 ---
you do the taint review in Relativity, I warned you that it was adding months worth of work on top of what 
was already done, and that Relativity was incapable of viewing everything. You insisted we do it this way. So 
now 
and I have come up with a way to fit this round peg into this square hole. We will get it done. 
Sorry it has taken so long, but we are talking about terabytes worth of data over multiple forms of digital 
evidence. Phones, tablets, loose media, cameras, DVRs, servers, laptops, and desktop computers. We have 
gotten past encryption on multiple devices. When we review devices on such large cases, we usually do it 
piece by piece as things are processed, I was unaware that you didn't want to review as things were 
processed, that you wanted to do it "all at once", so that added to the delay. Sorry for that. Just a 
differentiation of methodology I suppose. 
and I feel confident that the method we have come up with will be more consistent and preserve the 
attribution of files to devices and links of e-mails to attachments that the load file generation that I did a 
while back was lacking.

Okay, so just to check, you both think that there is not a need to do a test run? You're both comfortable with just 
basically sending us copies of everything? I don't totally understand why we couldn't have done that eight months 
ago, but regardless of the passage of time, I want to make sure we understand so we can report to our supervisors. I 
assume that means that we (at the U.S. Attorney's Office and through contractors) will therefore need to do all the 
processing ourselves, correct? And thanks again to you both.

Unfortunately I don't think this is very helpful to us. Did you take a look at the example spreadsheet I sent on 2/24? 
The excel file you sent has descriptions that don't match up to the items listed in the search warrant returns (that we 
sent on 2/23), and we don't have the 1B or CART numbers to be able to cross-reference. We also can't tell what you 
mean by "loose media" without a specific comparison to what was seized, we don't know which items you're referring 
to as "Windows machines," and we can't tell whether the entirety of any particular item has been transferred, or just 
partial. For example, it looks like we have gotten very, very few image files, which is surprising. 
We have also encountered some very significant problems in trying to review the more than 1 million documents we 
recently received: 
EFTA00027486
--- PAGE 14 ---
The data we've received has no way to put any emails and attachments together. So if an email says, "see the 
attached flight records," for example, we have no way of linking that up with the records themselves. Not only 
is that a big problem for us in review, it's going to be a huge problem for producing the documents to defense 
counsel. 
- 
The load file has no link to the native file, so when we load the data to the database, there's no way to have 
the native files show up in the database. Because many of the files are too large to open in the viewer, it 
effectively means that there are many files that are completely invisible to us. 
- 
Related, the control numbers in the load file don't match up to the native files. So we have two sets of 
numbers and no way to match up anything—that is, even if we were to try to go hunt down every individual 
large file in the native files, it would be impossible. 
So the data that we most recently got, we need to get in a form that addresses those issues, and we likely will need to 
get a similar reproduction of the data we received a couple months ago. Otherwise we're sifting through more than a 
million documents without much rhyme or reason. 
I've re-attached the spreadsheet we sent last week — I think that's a good place to start in terms of our necessary 
record-keeping, and we need that info at the very least, as well as anything else you think would be useful. Also 
attaching the SW returns for reference. And again, we're happy to meet up anytime and hash all this out in person if 
that's useful.

Here is a listing of what I have already handed over in load files to the US Attorney's Office for taint review. Some 
points of clarification: There were 9 IDE hard drives found in the Manhattan apartment, they turned out to be 3 copies 
of 3 drives (9 drives in total) from a July 2007 search on one of his properties. I only processed 3 (as they were all 
copies). All the loose media from the NY apartment is included. All the Windows machines from the NY apartment are 
included. Only 2 Macs from NY and 1 from the Island are included. 
I will have to more closely coordinate with whoever is loading up Relativity with the remaining Macs as the 
tool they have to be processed with does not easily re-name the load files. 
Spreadsheet is attached.

Totally understand about the network issues—we can relate. I do still think it will be helpful to all sit down together to 
have an in-person discussion, to make sure everybody is on the same page. Are folks available for that next week? 
And what I think would be most helpful to facilitate that would be a spreadsheet of each separate device referenced in 
the two search warrant returns, with columns for whether we've dumped the contents, whether they've been 
reviewed and/or transferred, what portions were transferred, etc. 
Something roughly like the attached, with any other categories you think would be useful — and the info on the 
attached is mostly hypothetical, obviously, just as examples. That will help us fully understand what's been reviewed, 
transferred, and received so far, and what remains.

(Also just on the pictures, we do want copies of those as well, please including from the discs and the devices — I think 
FBI was going to do an initial screen to make sure no CP, and since I think the answer was no, we'll need to get those to 
be able to review them as well.) 
many thanks,

Sony for the delayed response. They are tearing out our old network and giving us a new one, they mandated 
we delete old stuff (about 400 TB worth). Now that they are working on replacing the network, we can do 
only local work. I should be able to give you an accounting of what is what. I can say, off the top of my head, 
that all windows based items from the NY search have been handed over as well as all loose media. The CDs 
from NY only contained pictures, no documents. There are still some Apple items from NY that need to be 
produced. As far as the Island stuff goes, the 1st item on your spreadsheet, the "kitchen" mac has been 
produced. Still working on the rest.

Following up on the below from last weekend, I'm still not sure how we're addressing this so I thought it would make 
sense for us to all schedule a (hopefully relatively brief) meeting to all get on the same page? We didn't hear back on 
which files had previously been provided, but our tech folks did their best to differentiate, and we got access to the 
materials yesterday and its well over a million documents, and we don't have any idea what we're looking at — i.e., 
which devices the materials came from, whether it's full or partial results, how many more devices we have coming, 
etc. 
Based on the attached search warrant returns, it looks like from the New York mansion (the PDF) there are 
approximately 40 devices that would have storage (computers, hard drives, thumb drives, etc.) and that's not even 
counting at least 60+ CDs. And then from the Virgin Islands (the Excel spreadsheet), at least more than 25 devices, 
including multiple servers / server racks. 
So we gotta know what we've already received, what remains, anticipated schedule, etc, and I know it's a lot of 
moving pieces on all sides so wanted to loop in everybody at once. The case team will be in California this coming 
week from Tuesday through Friday, but then I think generally around the first week of March, which will hopefully be 
plenty of time to schedule a productive meeting. 
thanks all,

I'm not sure who's the exact right person to ask this, so wanted to get everybody on one email chain about it — I have 
the hard drive that 
dropped off that has new Epstein search warrant materials, but it looks like there are also 
old materials (that I think we had previously received and uploaded??) on the hard drive, and so I'm not sure what's 
new. 
Just generally, and 
and I talked about this last week too, but it's basically impossible for us to keep track of what 
we're getting, and what has been completed, without some kind of identification or labeling system, along with a list 
of which devices have been extracted and downloaded. 
So for example on the hard drive currently, there are 38 folders labeled "loadFiles" through "37loadFiles" with a 
modified date of 11/14/19, which I think we may have already previously received — but I'm not sure, because we 
haven't gotten any info on which folders match up to which devices, etc. And then there's another folder titled 
"NYC024362" that has a modified date of 1/27/20, so I think that may be the materials we hadn't previously received? 
That folder by itself has more than 600,000 items. 
I don't want to give 
anything that we've already previously received and uploaded, and I can't tell from the folder 
or file names whether everything on the drive is new, or whether just additional materials were saved onto it in 
addition to what we already have. 
, are you able to give us some guidance on this? Ultimately what we really 
need is a spreadsheet of every device, whether it's been dumped (or partially dumped), and then identifying that 
same info — which device, and what materials from it — are being given to us with each data transfer. Otherwise I think 
organizationally and for review purposes it will be a total disaster for us. 
We're happy to have a meeting on this if that's helpful — and thanks everybody for the assistance.

Following up on the below, I think we've given this our absolute best efforts with FBI — they are now well over a 
month later than their estimate from April on when we would get the New York materials, they're also past their 
estimate of getting us the New York materials from just this Monday, and we don't have anything close to an 
estimate on the USVI materials, which constitute the overwhelming majority of the data and are vastly more 
voluminous than the New York devices. We have kept pushing the timeline back for this option, hoping that CART 
will finalize, but I think at this point we should have a vendor do it. 
Attached is an estimate we got from BRG, which would get everything to us in under a month, and in Relativity-
friendly format, in a range of $85-135K. BRG has done this for our office multiple times in the past and are very 
effective and efficient, and they get the materials we need. And most importantly, they estimate they can do it all in 
less than a month. May we have approval to seek funding for this? The estimate is attached. Thanks very much.

You are getting both NY and USVI. The biggest stumbling block are the newer Mac items that are in APFS 
(there are a bunch from the Island,) so it is difficult to estimate how long those will take until I see how 
many items I have to export.

I am in the process ofAtoorting the materials (documents, spreadsheets, emails, etc) for your review as per 
my discussions with =. 
Most of the NY stuff is done, just Mac items left. This might take a few days as 
item in particular has over 500,000 emails. We will be able to provide discovery once Defense Council 
has provided drives for us to copy items over to. This goes quicker as there is no processing involved. I'll let 
you know when everything is complete.

Wanted to circle back on this and check in, particularly because we desperately need to get the results from the July

Unfortunately, recent events and our staffing levels have conspired to put a kink in just about everything. If 
we can't make heads or tails of the stuff I've already produced, we'll do it again. They have told us that our 
staffing levels will be steadily increasing over the next few weeks, but I'm going to have to push back my 
estimate by a week or 2. Sony about that. My next day in the office is Thursday, so I'll be able to see if I can

Thanks for this, it's a helpful start. In terms of being able to write our search warrant, one additional piece of 
information we need is the serial number, or some other specific identifier, ideally for each device but at least for any 
device that there is more than one of the same thing. So for example, we need to be able to somehow differentiate 
the following devices —
The two Dell power edge T310 hard drives (NYCO24323 and NYCO24324) 
The two Sony Vaio laptop / Fujitsu hdd (NYCO24336 and NYCO24337) 
the following loose storage devices: 
o Micro SD card (NYCO24339) 
o Flash Drive (generic) (NYCO24340) 
o Thumbdrive (Emtec) (NYCO24341) 
o hard drive (loose) (NYCO24342) 
o verbatim thumbdrive (NYCO24343) 
The four San Disk cruzer-thumbdrives (NYCO24344-47) 
The three Seagate IDE hard drives (NYCO24348-50) 
The camera SD card (NYCO24351) 
I think the rest of the devices are either specifically distinguishable and/or have an S/N listed. (By comparison, the 
USVI spreadsheet we have lists an s/n for about 20 of the 25(ish) devices. 
The other thing we're looking for is the location in the house (and ideally specific location) for each device, which the 
USVI list also has — is that info available? 
The list also has just five devices as still pending to be transferred to us, and I think it's right that the plan is to 
reproduce all the materials so that we can get them in searchable format, but just wanted to confirm? Currently, we 
aren't able to match any of the prior productions to specific devices — so if we're able to match them up by Bates

Here is The listing of all the evidence gathered in NY that I have. I added some columns to guide you to the 
unique numbers CART NY uses fro their evidence. The template wasn't a slam dunk over, so I did what I 
could to convey the information. If you are confused by anything, please let me know. In the column for 
approximate size, it is in GB, totaled at the bottom and converted to TB. In the materials contained column, 
I put what load file group the data was transferred over in (Mac, Windows, Loose Media, IDE, or Blacklight) 
If there is no entry in that column, that data has yet to be transferred. There are 2 Macs and a DVR you 
don't have as well as an iPhone and an iPad. IF the descriptions are a bit light, let me know and I'll do what 
I can to beef them up. I will get you the Island stuff tomorrow.

Respectfully, I think there are some miscommunications here — all we have asked is to receive the materials in a 
format such that we can view them using a system we have access to. We're not able to get web-enabled access 
through any FBI tool, so we asked for the materials to be transferred in a loadable format so we could put them on 
Relativity, which both we and the agents can access. We're required to have the files in a format that we can 
produce them to defense counsel. I've done that in many other cases and it hasn't previously been an issue. My 
understanding from =I is that the best way to do it now is just for us (the U.S. Attorney's Office) to get the original 
files, which our vendor will process—by which I just mean converting into file formats that are loadable onto 
Relativity. It doesn't really have anything to do with the taint review—we have to have access to the docs in our 
systems for discovery purposes. 
And we were happy to get the materials as they were processed, but when we received the 1.1 million documents 
earlier this year, they were in a format that wasn't usable for the reasons described in the email I sent on March 9. 
Again, I understand from =that the best way forward is to just get copies of the materials in their original 
formats, which I understand will be segregated and designated by device. That should work for us! I was just trying 
to understand the approach, as well as the timeline.

Just to be clear. The US Attorney's Office (or it's contractors) are not "processing" anything. You are taking 
files that I will be extracting from processed evidence and putting them into an E-Discovery tool (Relativity) 
to do a taint review. 
Relativity is NOT a forensic tool. It is incapable of dealing with many things that are found forensically on a 
computer like free space, slack space, and system files to name a few. When we started this, and you 
insisted you do the taint review in Relativity, I warned you that it was adding months worth of work on top 
of what was already done, and that Relativity was incapable of viewing everything. You insisted we do it 
this way. So now 
and I have come up with a way to fit this round peg into this square hole. We will get 
it done. 
Sorry it has taken so long, but we are talking about terabytes worth of data over multiple forms of digital 
evidence. Phones, tablets, loose media, cameras, DVRs, servers, laptops, and desktop computers. We have 
gotten past encryption on multiple devices. When we review devices on such large cases, we usually do it 
piece by piece as things are processed, I was unaware that you didn't want to review as things were 
processed, that you wanted to do it "all at once", so that added to the delay. Sorry for that. Just a 
differentiation of methodology I suppose. 
and I feel confident that the method we have come up with will be more consistent and preserve the 
attribution of files to devices and links of e-mails to attachments that the load file generation that I did a 
while back was lacking.

Okay, so just to check, you both think that there is not a need to do a test run? You're both comfortable with just 
basically sending us copies of everything? I don't totally understand why we couldn't have done that eight months 
ago, but regardless of the passage of time, I want to make sure we understand so we can report to our supervisors. I 
assume that means that we (at the U.S. Attorney's Office and through contractors) will therefore need to do all the 
processing ourselves, correct? And thanks again to you both.

In terms of data transfer, 
are you just sending a literal copy of all the raw data, and we'll process and upload 
it on our end? I ask to make sure we don't lose any searchability — when FBI sent versions before, it had already 
been processed. I think what we talked about on the phone a month ago was getting, for example, data from one 
device to make sure it transfers correctly, before sending over literally everything — is that still the plan?

Following up on the below, I think you had said you expected to be able to get us a list of the devices seized from the 
search warrants at Epstein's residences in New York and the USVI, as well as from his person upon arrest, in about a 
month (during our conference call a month ago) — so wanted to check if we can still expect that very soon? We're 
waiting on that list to be able to do an updated search warrant on all of those devices. Please let us know the 
current timeline — and also the current timeline on producing the results from those August and September 
searches? I think you and 
were going to coordinate on that, and you had mentioned you expected we'd have it 
a couple months from our call, which would be about a month from now. Wanted to make sure we're still on track.

Unfortunately I don't think this is very helpful to us. Did you take a look at the example spreadsheet I sent on 2/24? 
The excel file you sent has descriptions that don't match up to the items listed in the search warrant returns (that we 
sent on 2/23), and we don't have the 1B or CART numbers to be able to cross-reference. We also can't tell what you 
mean by "loose media" without a specific comparison to what was seized, we don't know which items you're 
referring to as "Windows machines," and we can't tell whether the entirety of any particular item has been 
transferred, or just partial. For example, it looks like we have gotten very, very few image files, which is surprising. 
We have also encountered some very significant problems in trying to review the more than 1 million documents we 
recently received: 
The data we've received has no way to put any emails and attachments together. So if an email says, "see 
the attached flight records," for example, we have no way of linking that up with the records themselves. 
Not only is that a big problem for us in review, it's going to be a huge problem for producing the documents 
to defense counsel. 
The load file has no link to the native file, so when we load the data to the database, there's no way to have 
the native files show up in the database. Because many of the files are too large to open in the viewer, it 
effectively means that there are many files that are completely invisible to us. 
Related, the control numbers in the load file don't match up to the native files. So we have two sets of 
numbers and no way to match up anything—that is, even if we were to try to go hunt down every individual 
large file in the native files, it would be impossible. 
So the data that we most recently got, we need to get in a form that addresses those issues, and we likely will need 
to get a similar reproduction of the data we received a couple months ago. Otherwise we're sifting through more 
than a million documents without much rhyme or reason. 
I've re-attached the spreadsheet we sent last week — I think that's a good place to start in terms of our necessary 
record-keeping, and we need that info at the very least, as well as anything else you think would be useful. Also 
attaching the SW returns for reference. And again, we're happy to meet up anytime and hash all this out in person if 
that's useful.

Here is a listing of what I have already handed over in load files to the US Attorney's Office for taint review. Some 
points of clarification: There were 9 IDE hard drives found in the Manhattan apartment, they turned out to be 3 
copies of 3 drives (9 drives in total) from a July 2007 search on one of his properties. I only processed 3 (as they were 
all copies). All the loose media from the NY apartment is included. All the Windows machines from the NY apartment 
are included. Only 2 Macs from NY and 1 from the Island are included. 
I will have to more closely coordinate with whoever is loading up Relativity with the remaining Macs as the 
tool they have to be processed with does not easily re-name the load files.

Totally understand about the network issues—we can relate. I do still think it will be helpful to all sit down together 
to have an in-person discussion, to make sure everybody is on the same page. Are folks available for that next 
week? And what I think would be most helpful to facilitate that would be a spreadsheet of each separate device 
referenced in the two search warrant returns, with columns for whether we've dumped the contents, whether 
they've been reviewed and/or transferred, what portions were transferred, etc. 
Something roughly like the attached, with any other categories you think would be useful — and the info on the 
attached is mostly hypothetical, obviously, just as examples. That will help us fully understand what's been reviewed, 
transferred, and received so far, and what remains. 
(Also just on the pictures, we do want copies of those as well, please including from the discs and the devices — I 
think FBI was going to do an initial screen to make sure no CP, and since I think the answer was no, we'll need to get 
those to be able to review them as well.)

Sorry for the delayed response. They are tearing out our old network and giving us a new one, they 
mandated we delete old stuff (about 400 TB worth). Now that they are working on replacing the network, 
we can do only local work. I should be able to give you an accounting of what is what. I can say, off the top 
of my head, that all windows based items from the NY search have been handed over as well as all loose 
media. The CDs from NY only contained pictures, no documents. There are still some Apple items from NY 
that need to be produced. As far as the Island stuff goes, the 1st item on your spreadsheet, the "kitchen" mac 
has been produced. Still working on the rest.

Following up on the below from last weekend, I'm still not sure how we're addressing this so I thought it would make 
sense for us to all schedule a (hopefully relatively brief) meeting to all get on the same page? We didn't hear back on 
which files had previously been provided, but our tech folks did their best to differentiate, and we got access to the 
materials yesterday and its well over a million documents, and we don't have any idea what we're looking at — i.e., 
EFTA00027506
--- PAGE 17 ---
which devices the materials came from, whether it's full or partial results, how many more devices we have coming, 
etc. 
Based on the attached search warrant returns, it looks like from the New York mansion (the PDF) there are 
approximately 40 devices that would have storage (computers, hard drives, thumb drives, etc.) and that's not even 
counting at least 60+ CDs. And then from the Virgin Islands (the Excel spreadsheet), at least more than 25 devices, 
including multiple servers / server racks. 
So we gotta know what we've already received, what remains, anticipated schedule, etc, and I know it's a lot of 
moving pieces on all sides so wanted to loop in everybody at once. The case team will be in California this coming 
week from Tuesday through Friday, but then I think generally around the first week of March, which will hopefully be 
plenty of time to schedule a productive meeting.

I'm not sure who's the exact right person to ask this, so wanted to get everybody on one email chain about it — I have 
the hard drive that 
dropped off that has new Epstein search warrant materials, but it looks like there are also 
old materials (that I think we had previously received and uploaded??) on the hard drive, and so I'm not sure what's 
new. 
Just generally, and 
and I talked about this last week too, but it's basically impossible for us to keep track of 
what we're getting, and what has been completed, without some kind of identification or labeling system, along with 
a list of which devices have been extracted and downloaded. 
So for example on the hard drive currently, there are 38 folders labeled "loadFiles" through "37loadFiles" with a 
modified date of 11/14/19, which I think we may have already previously received — but I'm not sure, because we 
haven't gotten any info on which folders match up to which devices, etc. And then there's another folder titled 
"NYC024362" that has a modified date of 1/27/20, so I think that may be the materials we hadn't previously 
received? That folder by itself has more than 600,000 items. 
I don't want to give 
anything that we've already previously received and uploaded, and I can't tell from the 
folder or file names whether everything on the drive is new, or whether just additional materials were saved onto it 
in addition to what we already have. =, 
are you able to give us some guidance on this? Ultimately what we 
really need is a spreadsheet of every device, whether it's been dumped (or partially dumped), and then identifying 
that same info — which device, and what materials from it — are being given to us with each data transfer. Otherwise 
I think organizationally and for review purposes it will be a total disaster for us. 
We're happy to have a meeting on this if that's helpful — and thanks everybody for the assistance.

Yes, there are a total of 62 devices which can be divided into three main buckets based on how/where we obtained them, 
the second and third of which are by far and away the biggest: 
• 
Phone and 1 iPad seized from Epstein at the time of his arrest on July 6, 2019. The FBI first delivered copies of 
the extractions from these devices last week. We were able to review the iPad, but we have not been able to 
open the iPhone data. IS THIS AN FBI TRANSMISSION ISSUE WITH THE IPHONE DATA, OR IS IT THAT IT WAS UN-
OPENABLE? 
• 
electronic devices seized from the New York residence on July 11, 2019. These include multiple hard drives, 
multiple computers, multiple USB drives, and multiple iPads. We currently have extractions from/access to none 
of them. 
• 
electronic devices seized from the Virgin Islands residence on August 12, 2019. These include multiple 
computers, multiple iPads, and multiple USB drives. We currently have extractions from/access to none of them.

Following up on the below, I think we've given this our absolute best efforts with FBI — they are now well over a 
month later than their estimate from April on when we would get the New York materials, they're also past their 
estimate of getting us the New York materials from just this Monday, and we don't have anything close to an 
estimate on the USVI materials, which constitute the overwhelming majority of the data and are vastly more 
voluminous than the New York devices. We have kept pushing the timeline back for this option, hoping that CART 
will finalize, but I think at this point we should have a vendor do it. 
Attached is an estimate we got from BRG, which would get everything to us in under a month, and in Relativity-
friendly format, in a range of $85-135K. BRG has done this for our office multiple times in the past and are very 
effective and efficient, and they get the materials we need. And most importantly, they estimate they can do it all in 
less than a month. May we have approval to seek funding for this? The estimate is attached. Thanks very much.

You are getting both NY and USVI. The biggest stumbling block are the newer Mac items that are in APFS 
(there are a bunch from the Island,) so it is difficult to estimate how long those will take until I see how 
many items I have to export.

Okay thanks, and just to clarify, a few days to finalize the New York materials, and then what about the USVI 
materials? I think that is quite a bit more. Just looking for an estimated completion date for everything. 
And on my other question — does this mean you're giving us a new, complete copy of everything from both NY and 
USVI?

I am in the process ofAttporting the materials (documents, spreadsheets, emails, etc) for your review as per 
my discussions with =. 
Most of the NY stuff is done, just Mac items left. This might take a few days as 
item in particular has over 500,000 emails. We will be able to provide discovery once Defense Council 
has provided drives for us to copy items over to. This goes quicker as there is no processing involved. I'll let 
you know when everything is complete.

Wanted to circle back on this and check in, particularly because we desperately need to get the results from the July

Unfortunately, recent events and our staffing levels have conspired to put a kink in just about everything. If 
we can't make heads or tails of the stuff I've already produced, we'll do it again. They have told us that our 
staffing levels will be steadily increasing over the next few weeks, but I'm going to have to push back my 
estimate by a week or 2. Sony about that. My next day in the office is Thursday, so I'll be able to see if I can

Thanks for this, it's a helpful start. In terms of being able to write our search warrant, one additional piece of 
information we need is the serial number, or some other specific identifier, ideally for each device but at least for any 
device that there is more than one of the same thing. So for example, we need to be able to somehow differentiate 
the following devices —
The two Dell power edge T310 hard drives (NYCO24323 and NYCO24324) 
The two Sony Vaio laptop / Fujitsu hdd (NYCO24336 and NYCO24337) 
the following loose storage devices: 
o Micro SD card (NYCO24339) 
o Flash Drive (generic) (NYCO24340) 
o Thumbdrive (Emtec) (NYCO24341) 
o hard drive (loose) (NYCO24342) 
o verbatim thumbdrive (NYCO24343) 
The four San Disk cruzer-thumbdrives (NYCO24344-47) 
The three Seagate IDE hard drives (NYCO24348-50) 
The camera SD card (NYCO24351) 
I think the rest of the devices are either specifically distinguishable and/or have an S/N listed. (By comparison, the 
USVI spreadsheet we have lists an s/n for about 20 of the 25(ish) devices. 
The other thing we're looking for is the location in the house (and ideally specific location) for each device, which the 
USVI list also has — is that info available? 
The list also has just five devices as still pending to be transferred to us, and I think it's right that the plan is to 
reproduce all the materials so that we can get them in searchable format, but just wanted to confirm? Currently, we 
aren't able to match any of the prior productions to specific devices — so if we're able to match them up by Bates

Here is The listing of all the evidence gathered in NY that I have. I added some columns to guide you to the 
unique numbers CART NY uses fro their evidence. The template wasn't a slam dunk over, so I did what I 
could to convey the information. If you are confused by anything, please let me know. In the column for

--- PAGE 9 ---
approximate size, it is in GB, totaled at the bottom and converted to TB. In the materials contained column, 
I put what load file group the data was transferred over in (Mac, Windows, Loose Media, IDE, or Blacklight) 
If there is no entry in that column, that data has yet to be transferred. There are 2 Macs and a DVR you 
don't have as well as an iPhone and an iPad. IF the descriptions are a bit light, let me know and I'll do what 
I can to beef them up. I will get you the Island stuff tomorrow.

Respectfully, I think there are some miscommunications here — all we have asked is to receive the materials in a 
format such that we can view them using a system we have access to. We're not able to get web-enabled access 
through any FBI tool, so we asked for the materials to be transferred in a loadable format so we could put them on 
Relativity, which both we and the agents can access. We're required to have the files in a format that we can 
produce them to defense counsel. I've done that in many other cases and it hasn't previously been an issue. My 
understanding from 
is that the best way to do it now is just for us (the U.S. Attorney's Office) to get the original 
files, which our vendor will process—by which I just mean converting into file formats that are loadable onto 
Relativity. It doesn't really have anything to do with the taint review—we have to have access to the docs in our 
systems for discovery purposes. 
And we were happy to get the materials as they were processed, but when we received the 1.1 million documents 
earlier this year, they were in a format that wasn't usable for the reasons described in the email I sent on March 9. 
Again, I understand from =that the best way forward is to just get copies of the materials in their original 
formats, which I understand will be segregated and designated by device. That should work for us! I was just trying 
to understand the approach, as well as the timeline.

Just to be clear. The US Attorney's Office (or it's contractors) are not "processing" anything. You are taking 
files that I will be extracting from processed evidence and putting them into an E-Discovery tool (Relativity) 
to do a taint review. 
Relativity is NOT a forensic tool. It is incapable of dealing with many things that are found forensically on a 
computer like free space, slack space, and system files to name a few. When we started this, and you 
insisted you do the taint review in Relativity, I warned you that it was adding months worth of work on top 
of what was already done, and that Relativity was incapable of viewing everything. You insisted we do it 
this way. So now 
and I have come up with a way to fit this round peg into this square hole. We will get 
it done. 
Sorry it has taken so long, but we are talking about terabytes worth of data over multiple forms of digital 
evidence. Phones, tablets, loose media, cameras, DVRs, servers, laptops, and desktop computers. We have 
gotten past encryption on multiple devices. When we review devices on such large cases, we usually do it 
piece by piece as things are processed, I was unaware that you didn't want to review as things were 
processed, that you wanted to do it "all at once", so that added to the delay. Sorry for that. Just a 
differentiation of methodology I suppose. 
and I feel confident that the method we have come up with will be more consistent and preserve the 
attribution of files to devices and links of e-mails to attachments that the load file generation that I did a 
while back was lacking.

Okay, so just to check, you both think that there is not a need to do a test run? You're both comfortable with just 
basically sending us copies of everything? I don't totally understand why we couldn't have done that eight months 
ago, but regardless of the passage of time, I want to make sure we understand so we can report to our supervisors. I 
assume that means that we (at the U.S. Attorney's Office and through contractors) will therefore need to do all the 
processing ourselves, correct? And thanks again to you both.

Like

Unfortunately I don't think this is very helpful to us. Did you take a look at the example spreadsheet I sent on 2/24? 
The excel file you sent has descriptions that don't match up to the items listed in the search warrant returns (that we 
sent on 2/23), and we don't have the 1B or CART numbers to be able to cross-reference. We also can't tell what you 
EFTA00027523
--- PAGE 15 ---
mean by "loose media" without a specific comparison to what was seized, we don't know which items you're 
referring to as "Windows machines," and we can't tell whether the entirety of any particular item has been 
transferred, or just partial. For example, it looks like we have gotten very, very few image files, which is surprising. 
We have also encountered some very significant problems in trying to review the more than 1 million documents we 
recently received: 
The data we've received has no way to put any emails and attachments together. So if an email says, "see 
the attached flight records," for example, we have no way of linking that up with the records themselves. 
Not only is that a big problem for us in review, it's going to be a huge problem for producing the documents 
to defense counsel. 
The load file has no link to the native file, so when we load the data to the database, there's no way to have 
the native files show up in the database. Because many of the files are too large to open in the viewer, it 
effectively means that there are many files that are completely invisible to us. 
Related, the control numbers in the load file don't match up to the native files. So we have two sets of 
numbers and no way to match up anything—that is, even if we were to try to go hunt down every individual 
large file in the native files, it would be impossible. 
So the data that we most recently got, we need to get in a form that addresses those issues, and we likely will need 
to get a similar reproduction of the data we received a couple months ago. Otherwise we're sifting through more 
than a million documents without much rhyme or reason. 
I've re-attached the spreadsheet we sent last week — I think that's a good place to start in terms of our necessary 
record-keeping, and we need that info at the very least, as well as anything else you think would be useful. Also 
attaching the SW returns for reference. And again, we're happy to meet up anytime and hash all this out in person if 
that's useful.

points of clarification: There were 9 IDE hard drives found in the Manhattan apartment, they turned out to be 3 
copies of 3 drives (9 drives in total) from a July 2007 search on one of his properties. I only processed 3 (as they were 
all copies). All the loose media from the NY apartment is included. All the Windows machines from the NY apartment 
are included. Only 2 Macs from NY and 1 from the Island are included. 
I will have to more closely coordinate with whoever is loading up Relativity with the remaining Macs as the 
tool they have to be processed with does not easily re-name the load files. 
Spreadsheet is attached.

Totally understand about the network issues—we can relate. I do still think it will be helpful to all sit down together 
to have an in-person discussion, to make sure everybody is on the same page. Are folks available for that next 
week? And what I think would be most helpful to facilitate that would be a spreadsheet of each separate device 
referenced in the two search warrant returns, with columns for whether we've dumped the contents, whether 
they've been reviewed and/or transferred, what portions were transferred, etc. 
Something roughly like the attached, with any other categories you think would be useful — and the info on the 
attached is mostly hypothetical, obviously, just as examples. That will help us fully understand what's been reviewed, 
transferred, and received so far, and what remains. 
(Also just on the pictures, we do want copies of those as well, please including from the discs and the devices — I 
think FBI was going to do an initial screen to make sure no CP, and since I think the answer was no, we'll need to get 
those to be able to review them as well.) 
many thanks,

Sony for the delayed response. They are tearing out our old network and giving us a new one, they 
mandated we delete old stuff (about 400 TB worth). Now that they are working on replacing the network, 
we can do only local work. I should be able to give you an accounting of what is what. I can say, off the top 
of my head, that all windows based items from the NY search have been handed over as well as all loose 
media. The CDs from NY only contained pictures, no documents. There are still some Apple items from NY 
that need to be produced. As far as the Island stuff goes, the 1st item on your spreadsheet, the "kitchen" mac 
has been produced. Still working on the rest.

Team, 
Following up on the below from last weekend, I'm still not sure how we're addressing this so I thought it would make 
sense for us to all schedule a (hopefully relatively brief) meeting to all get on the same page? We didn't hear back on 
which files had previously been provided, but our tech folks did their best to differentiate, and we got access to the 
materials yesterday and its well over a million documents, and we don't have any idea what we're looking at — i.e., 
which devices the materials came from, whether it's full or partial results, how many more devices we have coming, 
etc. 
Based on the attached search warrant returns, it looks like from the New York mansion (the PDF) there are 
approximately 40 devices that would have storage (computers, hard drives, thumb drives, etc.) and that's not even 
EFTA00027526
--- PAGE 18 ---
counting at least 60+ CDs. And then from the Virgin Islands (the Excel spreadsheet), at least more than 25 devices, 
including multiple servers / server racks. 
So we gotta know what we've already received, what remains, anticipated schedule, etc, and I know it's a lot of 
moving pieces on all sides so wanted to loop in everybody at once. The case team will be in California this coming 
week from Tuesday through Friday, but then I think generally around the first week of March, which will hopefully be 
plenty of time to schedule a productive meeting. 
thanks all,

I'm not sure who's the exact right person to ask this, so wanted to get everybody on one email chain about it — I have 
the hard drive that 
dropped off that has new Epstein search warrant materials, but it looks like there are also 
old materials (that I think we had previously received and uploaded??) on the hard drive, and so I'm not sure what's 
new. 
Just generally, and 
and I talked about this last week too, but it's basically impossible for us to keep track of 
what we're getting, and what has been completed, without some kind of identification or labeling system, along with 
a list of which devices have been extracted and downloaded. 
So for example on the hard drive currently, there are 38 folders labeled "loadFiles" through "37loadFiles" with a 
modified date of 11/14/19, which I think we may have already previously received — but I'm not sure, because we 
haven't gotten any info on which folders match up to which devices, etc. And then there's another folder titled 
"NYC024362" that has a modified date of 1/27/20, so I think that may be the materials we hadn't previously 
received? That folder by itself has more than 600,000 items. 
I don't want to give I= 
anything that we've already previously received and uploaded, and I can't tell from the 
folder or file names whether everything on the drive is new, or whether just additional materials were saved onto it 
in addition to what we already have. =, 
are you able to give us some guidance on this? Ultimately what we 
really need is a spreadsheet of every device, whether it's been dumped (or partially dumped), and then identifying 
that same info — which device, and what materials from it — are being given to us with each data transfer. Otherwise 
I think organizationally and for review purposes it will be a total disaster for us. 
We're happy to have a meeting on this if that's helpful — and thanks everybody for the assistance.

The SEC knows it. The degenerate Epstein knows it. The Degenerate Leon Black/Kushner BFF/ Milken

The DOORS knows it. 
IG, I have repeatedly offered to come to SEC DC HQ to have the brightest minds at the SEC totally humiliate me 
by refuting my allegations 1 by 1. The grossly corrupt SEC scumbags have never taken me up on my generous 
offer. For the very simple reason that ALL of my allegations are accurate and true. 
So, I again put the offer out there: 
refute my claims OR go to jail for the criminal obstruction ACTIVELY being facilitated by your office and the SEC. 
So, let's give these scumbags the insurance/annuities market. 
This will NOT end well for tens of thousands of Americans.

This was a blatant attempt to intimidate a whistleblower. "HE" (I think a male although very effeminate voice)

This is a VERY serious matter. Felony. I intend to see "him" prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Within

PROCEEDINGS AND EVENTS 
11:00 a.m. — Pretrial conference in U.S. v. Jeffrey Epstein — the defendant is charged with sexually exploiting and 
abusing dozens of underage girls by enticing them to engage in sex acts with him in exchange for money, and 
allegedly working with several employees and associates to ensure that he had a steady supply of minor victims 
to abuse, and paid several of those victims themselves to recruit other underage girls to engage in similar sex acts 
for money — before Judge Berman (courtroom 17B, 500 Pearl Street).

Hello—
I have made the changes to the Focus Group Questionnaire that you requested. 
The Jury Instructions are ready to print. Please bring 40 copies (stapled upper left) with you to the focus group on Saturday. 
The Verdict Questions are printed at the end of the questionnaire. The facilitators orally encourage the juries to reach a unanimous 
verdict, but ultimately each juror marks their own verdict sheet with their own individual vote. If the verdict is not unanimous, we see 
which jurors voted for the defense, and during the debrief after the deliberations on each count we find out why they voted the way they 
did. 
Will you be bringing binders with copies of documents for jurors to refer to?

Thanks again for all your help getting the team ready for the focus group exercise this weekend. For this case, we have a 
witness coming in for trial prep this week. 
is going to conduct a mock cross examination of her. In order to help him 
prep for that, could you please put together a binder of the 302s of her interviews? 
can point you to the 
folder on the shared where all of that lives (things have been moving around a bit as we prep to produce 3500). The 
witness is 
(that's her married name — she used to be 
so some documents are titled that 
way). 
If you're able to get that to

M
by tomorrow morning, that would be great. Thanks!

Ms. 
As I understand now your office has been advised that I have been formerly retained by Retired FBI Special Agent 
in connection with her being subpoenaed 
to testify in United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell case pending in the SDNY. 
Ms. 
has conveyed some concerns about her inability to properly prepare for her testimony whether for the 
prosecution or defense given that she has not been given a copy of the 1A notes that were originally prepared in

Ms. 
As I understand now your office has been advised that I have been formerly retained by Retired FBI Special Agent 
in connection with her being subpoenaed 
to testify in United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell case pending in the SDNY. 
Ms. 
has conveyed some concerns about her inability to properly prepare for her testimony whether for the 
prosecution or defense given that she has not been given a copy of the IA notes that were originally prepared in 
preparation to the FD-302 written that she may be called to testify about. ( I will be able to elaborate via tel/cal with you). 
Additionally, my client was interviewed by Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) just prior to her retirement. This

I am sending some of the Flight Plan information that you requested. This information pertains to the helicopters that we 
discussed, including N491GM (for which we are still uncertain on the exact dates of ownership.) I hope that there is some 
useful information in here. Hopefully, you have someone who is good with Excel. That's the best way to be able to analyze 
or quickly find the information you might be looking for. 
I have included a few notes here to help you understand the information, but if you have questions, you can give me a 
call. 
The first thing you are probably going to wonder about are the dates which are part of the Dept Time, Dest Time columns, 
but also system tracking dates (more easily understandable) all the way to the right. You'll eventually notice that the 
earliest information on this batch of information is from 2007. It was around that time that we started keeping these 
records. 
The Airport Codes are the ICAO codes. The easiest way to figure out the departure and destination is to either google the 
airport identifier or use the list at this site: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAO airport code 
All airports in the continental US begin with the ICAO code K. So if you see a three letter code, it is likely in the US, and 
would be prefaced with "K" in the ICAO code. For example, BOS (Boston Logan International Airport is KBOS). JFK is KJFK. 
All times (DEPT TIME, DEST TIME, ETA) are in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) which we use in aviation. The format in 
these columns is: CDDTTTT. "C" is an internal code, "DD" is the day, and "TTTT" is the time, UTC, in 24-hour format. 
DEPT DOM and DEST DOM reflect whether the Departure or Destination locations are Domestic. This should provide 
some context for the airport codes, but I left that in, since international flights should have (are required to file) eAPIS 
information, and these columns might make it easier for you to find those flights. 
The FIX column isn't likely to be very helpful, but it refers to navigational fixes. It could provide additional clues to 
understanding where the flight went, but your best bet is to focus on the Dept and Dest. FIX has some very specific 
scenarios where it may be useful, but generally speaking it isn't worth a lot of time and energy, since the dept./dest. and 
times and dates are more relevant. The same is true with the ROUTE column. 
The MSG TYPE corresponds to the following Codes: 
ARR - Arrival 
AM Amendment 
CHG Change 
CNL Cancel 
DEP Departure 
DFP Defense Flight Plan (DVFR) 
DM Departure 
FP Flight Plan 
FPL Flight Plan 
LCM Lockheed Message (normally that a callsign received a verbal briefing) 
UZ Border crossing 
Hopefully you will all be able to find some decent leads or solidify some of your timelines of interest based on the 
information provided.

Subject: RE: Aircraft info 
Please call when you get this information. 
I have attached Registration information for N331JE and N722JE. N722JE is the entire aircraft registration file. N331JE is 
just the section that appeared to contain all relevant information to your case. I can give you the entire file if you think 
there is more that might be applicable, and certified copies of the entire files can be obtained if they need to be used in 
court. In my experience, sending the entire aircraft registration file from the start usually is daunting for the investigators, 
and leads to tons of questions just trying to figure out what might be relevant. Sometimes aircraft files are 300 pages or 
more, and that can be frustrating when maybe only 20 were relevant to the SUBJECT. 
I have also attached the LLC Documents for Hyperion Air LLC which is the registered owner for both N331JE and N722JE. 
I have attached the Airman File for the SUBJECT, which is encrypted due to PH. I will send the password in a follow-on e-
mail. I looked at the medical file, but I believe the information contained therein has limited value to your investigation. I 
have created a separate encrypted document with only the information that may be helpful, so that you can evaluate 
potentially relevant information while maintaining medical privacy. If the information in the airman file or the document I 
created turns out to be critical evidence for your case, then certified copies of the airman and/or medical file can be 
obtained at a later date. 
As I mentioned previously, I want to clarify some details regarding the helicopters. What I found appeared to be slightly 
different from what was included in the original e-mail to me below.

Hi 
It was nice talking with you yesterday. Thanks for your assistance with this. Please see the below email of aircraft 
information. 
Below are the aircrafts we believe Maxwell has/had been using. The helicopter we know that she personally piloted, while 
the jets we know her to be a passenger. You'll notice some of the aircrafts will be associated with Jeffrey Epstein, as she 
traveled with him frequently. Any information you are able to provide would be helpful. If there is additional passenger 
manifests for each of these aircrafts we'd like to know that as well. I know we discussed that sometimes that's not 
available. As you can imagine, this case is high profile, so I appreciate any discretion you can make on your part. 
Please let me know if I left something out that would be able to assist you in any way.

Subject: JE state plea transcript 
Check out pages 38-39 of his state plea: 
Epstein counsel: Inhere is a nonprosecution agreement with the United States Attorney's office that triggers as a result 
of this plea agreement. In other words, they have signed off and said they will not prosecute Mr. Epstein in the Southern 
District of Florida for any offense upon his successful taking of his plea today. That is a confidential document that the 
parties have agreed to. Just in an abundance of caution, I wanted to tell the court." 
The Court: "Mr. Epstein, your attorney has told me that in addition to everything, we talked about another inducement, 
shall we say, to your taking this plea is that the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of the State of Florida, federal 
prosecutor, has agreed to a nonprosecution agreement with you, meaning that if you successfully complete probation and 
do everything you're supposed to, they have, have agreed not to prosecute you federally, did you understand that?" 
The Defendant: "Yes, ma'am." 
The prosecutor then notes that SDFL people ("they") were in court for the plea.

MS. BELOHLAVEK: Correct. 
THE COURT: Community control one --
that would be no electronic monitor? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: That is correct. 
THE COURT: Now which of the terms 
and conditions of community control one are 
you incorporating? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: I can go through 
them with Your Honor. 
THE COURT: None of the them appear 
to be articulated in the plea sheet which 
is why I'm asking. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: These are the 
standard conditions of community control by 
statute would apply to anyone that goes on 
community control and out of an abundance 
of caution, we simply memorialized those 
standard conditions in the plea sheet 
agreement. 
THE COURT: The Court shall require 
intensive supervision and surveillance for 
an offender placed on community control 
which may include but is not limited to 
specified contact with the parole and

Your Honor. 
THE COURT: I don't see that in the 
plea sheet. That's why I'm asking the 
questions. No one has specified how often, 
how frequently he is to have contact with 
his parole and probation officer. 
Confinement to an agreed upon residence 
during the hours away from employment and 
public service activity, has that been 
articulated? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: I believe

Judge McSorley has a standard order 
somewhere on the bench up there regarding 
this, I'm told by the prosecutor. 
MS. LENHARDT: Judge, usually this is

sheets -- I have seen them incorporated in

McSorley has that. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: We'd be happy to 
execute that document, Your Honor. We were

off on all conditions of community control.

Judge McSorley does this which makes

apply and everyone must initial them. We 
will go over it. If you wish to change 
you understand there is quite a bit of 
latitude given the court in putting 
somebody on community control. If you 
agree to some change, let me know, but 
understand at the outset that I'm a big fan 
of specificity. I want to know what he 
will be doing for employment. I want to 
know exactly where he is going to be living 
and I want it on the record now. It can 
change but it can only change with 
preapproval by DOC. I want it crystal 
clear. I don't want the community control 
officer who gets this case the day he walks 
out the Palm Beach County to have any doubt 
or confusion as to exactly what this 
defendant is supposed to do, where he is 
supposed to be when, exactly what I am 
requesting that officer to supervise. 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: Absolutely.

(Brief recess.) 
MR. GOLDBERGER: Your-nonor, we are 
back on Jeffrey Epstein, actually it 
worked, we had an opportunity to go through 
Judge McSorley's conditions of community 
control and we asked the Department of 
Corrections representative to assist us to 
make sure we did everything properly. 
They were very helpful and we executed the 
document. 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: Yes, and Your Honor, 
this defendant doesn't fall under the sex 
offender probation but we have included 
special sex offender conditions as part of 
the community control and they are all 
circled there. 
. 
THE COURT: The plea agreement stated 
the defendant is designated as a sexual 
offender pursuant to Florida Statute 
942.035. 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: Correct. But the 
sex offender probation, the statute is 
different and only applies to certain 
offenses and this one was not enumerated.

sure both I and the defendant are clear. 
The sexual offender statute you are 
referring to in the plea sheet is the one 
that requires registration? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: Correct. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: Correct. 
THE COURT: And we will talk about 
that. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: Okay. 
THE COURT: But it is not the one 
that requires the special conditions of sex 
offender probation? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: Correct. 
THE COURT: Now, rather than 948, do 
you want me to disregard 948? He's read 
it? 
MS. BELOELAVEK: He's read it. 
THE COURT: We will leave it in 
there. But these conditions we are going 
to go over right now are going to be viewed 
in my mind, yes, and they have been signed 
by the defendant and we will go over that 
in a second as a part of the whole plea.

conditions, A, you will remain confined to 
 your residence except one half hour before
and after your approved employment, 
community service work or any other 
activity approved by your probation 
officer. 
B, you will maintain an hourly 
accounting of all your activities on a 
daily log which you will submit to your 
supervising officer upon request. 
My understanding about the daily 
log, maybe I'm just confused from other 
cases I've heard, is the daily log is a 
weekly log, I cuess it is submitted ahead 
of time, is that correct?

THE COURT: So part A, where he has 
to stay in his residence except for one 
hour before and after the approved 
employment, community service work and

that he's supposedly done all that he 
himself will be keeping a daily log?

the defendant will be residing at 358 El 
Brillo Way, Palm Beach, Florida, 33480. He 
knows now that that's where he will be 
living when he is released after his 12

residence or able to reside there, he will 
have the obligation of notifying his 
probation officer prior, and I emphasize 
this, prior to his release from custody. I 
assume that the department will be notified 
prior to, to his release?

to send someone to meet with him before he

everything, from the day he walks out 
occurs in Palm Beach County, is that clear?

condition of his probation, they are not 
sex offender standard conditions, they are 
just conditions that are being imposed 
especially in this case?

shall submit to a mandatory curfew from 10

restrictions regarding work or approved 
activity, there will be no exceptions to

age of 18 years which I gather is the case 
because it's circled, you shall not live 
within 1000 feet of a school, day care 
center, park, playground or other place 
where children regularly congregate. 
Has someone verified that 358 El 
Brillo is such a place?

done prior to his release.

THE COURT: Neither do I, which is 
why I'm asking. Has that been 
investigated? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: We have done our due 
diligence, for what it's worth, there is a 
residential street. There are not children 
congregating on that street. We think the 
address applies, if it doesn't, we fully 
recognize that he can't live there. 
THE COURT: Okay. D is, you shall 
not have any contact with the victim, are 
there more than one victim? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: There's several. 
THE COURT: Several, all of the 
victims. So this should be plural. I'm 
making that plural. You are not to have 
any contact direct or indirect, and in this 
day and age I find it necessary to go over 
exactly what we mean by indirect. By 
indirect, we mean no text messages, no

shall not until you have successfully

you choose -- or defense and the State 
together, why twelve months in the Palm 
Beach County jail followed by six months? 
Why not just send him to DOC? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: It was the agreement 
of the parties, Your Honor. We just 
decided that was the best way to accomplish 
what needed to be done here and the parties 
agreed that that sentence satisfied 
everyone's requirements. 
THE COURT: The taxpayers of Palm 
Beach County is going to pay 18 months to 
house this guy instead of DOC? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: Right. 
THE COURT: You understand we're 
losing positions left 
government because we

and right in county 
haven't got enough 
okay. 
His requirement to register there 
is many, many 
there is nine pages 
outlining the sexual offender's requirement 
to register with the department and 
penalty, have you read all those, 
Mr. Epstein? 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes, ma'am.

be an ongoing life long obligation? 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes, ma'am. 
THE COURT: And this registration 
occurs when? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: Within 48-hours of 
release. 
THE COURT: So when he gets out of 
the Palm Beach County jail, he needs to 
register? Okay. And the department 
who 
is going to provide him with the form? 
MR. GOLDBERGER: He actually 
registers out at the Sheriff's Office, Your 
Honor, we can do it out there. 
THE COURT: Okay. It has been 
brought to my attention that FDLE is the 
one who is statutorily required to handle 
these registrations but some of our 
municipal jurisdictions have taken it upon 
themselves to impose additional 
requirements, y'all understand that? 
MS. BELOHLAVEK: Correct. 
MR. GOLDBERGER: Right.

he has to do is the official State of

MS. BELOHLAVEK: Correct. 
THE COURT: Mr. Epstein, I need to 
make sure you understand that that's what's 
required by this plea. Anyone on 
probation, community control is required to 
live and abide by the laws. So if a 
jurisdiction you choose to reside in should.
have some additional municipal requirements 
you will be required in order to comply 
with the law of living there, just like you 
can't get a parking ticket or speeding 
ticket, to comply with those regulations 
but I want to make sure you understand 
because I have seen some defendants who 
have been confused about this. If you 
don't, for example, if the Town of Palm 
Beach has you register that does not take 
care of your requirement. Your requirement 
to register with FDLE through the Sheriff's 
office is separate, distinct and must be 
done on their form according to their 
schedule. 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes, ma'am.

nonprosecution agreement with the United

result of this plea agreement. In other 
words, they have signed off and said they 
will not prosecute Mr. Epstein in the 
Southern District of Florida for any 
offense upon his successful taking of this 
plea today. That is a confidential 
document that the parties have agreed to. 
Just in an abundance of caution, I wanted 
to tell the court.

also be invalidated should he violate his

THE COURT: Mr. Epstein needs to come

Mr. Epstein, your attorney has 
told me that in addition to everything, we 
talked about another Inducement, shall we 
say, to your taking this plea is that the 
U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of 
the State of Florida, federal prosecutor, 
has agreed to a nonprosecution agreement 
with you, meaning that if you successfully 
complete probation and do everything you're 
supposed to, they have, have agreed not to 
prosecute you federally, did you understand 
that? 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes, ma'am. 
THE COURT: And I would view that as 
a significant inducement in accepting this 
plea.

influencing this defendant to make this

that's the right idea.

THE COURT: Mr. Epstein, is there

PROFFER AGREEMENT 
With respect to the meeting o 
"Client") and her attorney, Joseph
Nascimento, Esq., with Assistant United States Attorneys 
and 
to be 
held on July 12, 2019 ("the meeting"), the following understandings exist: 
(1) THIS IS NOT A COOPERATION AGREEMENT. The Client has agreed to 
provide the Government with information, and to respond to questions, so that the Government 
may evaluate Client's information and responses in making prosecutive decisions. By receiving 
Client's proffer, the Government does not agree to make a motion on the Client's behalf or to enter 
into a cooperation agreement, plea agreement, immunity or non-prosecution agreement. The 
Government makes no representation about the likelihood that any such agreement will be reached 
in connection with this proffer. 
(2) In any prosecution brought against Client by this Office, except as provided below the 
Government will not offer in evidence on its case-in-chief, or in connection with any sentencing 
proceeding for the purpose of determining an appropriate sentence, any statements made by Client 
at the meeting, except (a) in a prosecution for false statements, obstruction of justice or perjury 
with respect to any acts committed or statements made during or after the meeting or testimony 
given after the meeting; or (b) if, at any time following the meeting, Client becomes a fugitive 
from justice. 
(3) Notwithstanding item (2) above: (a) the Government may use information derived 
directly or indirectly from the meeting for the purpose of obtaining leads to other evidence, which 
evidence may be used in any prosecution of Client by the Government; (b) in any prosecution 
brought against Client, the Government may use statements made by Client at the meeting and all 
evidence obtained directly or indirectly therefrom for the purpose of cross-examination should 
Client testify; and (c) the Government may also use statements made by Client at the meeting to 
rebut any evidence or arguments offered by or on behalf of Client (including arguments made or 
issues raised sua sponte by the District Court) at any stage of the criminal prosecution (including 
bail, all phases of trial, and sentencing) in any prosecution brought against Client. 
(4) The Client understands and agrees that in the event the Client seeks to qualify for a 
reduction in sentence under Title 18, United States Code, Section 3553(f), United States 
Sentencing Guidelines, Sections 2D1.1(b)(18) or 5C1.2, or Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(b), the Office may 
offer or use at any stage of the criminal proceeding any statement made by Client during the 
meeting, and all evidence obtained directly or indirectly therefrom, to the extent such use is 
consistent with Section 402 of the First Step Act of 2018. 
(5) To the extent that the Government is entitled under this Agreement to offer in evidence

Attached please find a fact witness travel request for our fist witness in the Maxwell trial 
He'll be flying in 
from California, so he'll need to travel to NY on 11/27 in order to meet with me on 11/28. I expect he'll testify on 11/29, 
but he could possible bleed over into 11/30 if we get tied up in jury selection issues, so I'd like to schedule his flight out of 
NY for the evening of 11/30. Please let me know if you have any questions, and thank you, as always, for your help.

Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 435 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/21/2019 Page 1 of 33 
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA 
CASE NO. 08-80736-CIV-MARRA 
JANE DOE I AND JANE DOE 2, 
Petitioners, 
vs. 
UNITED STATES, 
Respondent. 
OPINION AND ORDER 
This cause is before the Court upon Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2's Motion for Partial 
Summary Judgment (DE 361); the United States's Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment (DE 
408); Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2's Motion to Compel Answers (DE 348) and Jane Doe I and 
Jane Doe 2's Motion for Finding Waiver of Work Product and Similar Protections by 
Government and for Production of Documents (DE 414). The Motions are fully briefed and ripe 
for review. The Court has carefully considered the Motions and is otherwise fully advised in the 
premises. 
I. Background 
The facts, as culled from affidavits, exhibits, depositions, answers to interrogatories and 
reasonably inferred, for the purpose of these motions, are as follows: 
From between about 1999 and 2007, Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused more than 30 minor 
girls, including Petitioners Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2 ( hereinafter, "Petitioners"), at his mansion 
in Palm Beach, Florida, and elsewhere in the United States and overseas. (Government Resp. to 
Petitioner's Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (hereinafter, "DE 407" at 9 1.) Because

Epstein and his co-conspirators knowingly traveled in interstate and international commerce to 
sexually abuse Jane Doe 1, Jane Doe 2 and others, they committed violations of not only Florida 
law, but also federal law. (DE 407 at ¶ 2.) In addition to his own sexual abuse of the victims, 
Epstein directed other persons to abuse the girls sexually. (DE 407 at ¶ 3.) Epstein used paid 
employees to find and bring minor girls to him. Epstein worked in concert with others to obtain 
minors not only for his own sexual gratification, but also for the sexual gratification of others. 
(DE 407 at ¶ 8.) 
In 2005, the Town of Palm Beach Police Department ("PBPD") received a complaint 
from the parents of a 14 year old girl about her sexual abuse by Jeffery Epstein. The PBPD 
ultimately identified approximately 20 girls between the ages of 14 and 17 who were sexually 
abused by Epstein. (DE 407 at ¶ 4.) In 2006, at the request of the PBPD, the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation ("FBI") opened an investigation into allegations that Epstein and his personal 
assistants used the facilities of interstate commerce to induce girls between the ages of 14 and 17 
to engage in illegal sexual activities. (DE 407 at ¶ 5.) The FBI ultimately determined that both 
Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2 were victims of sexual abuse by Epstein while they were minors. Jane 
Doe 1 provided information about her abuse and Jane Doe 2's abuse to the FBI on August 7, 
2007. (DE 407 at ¶ 6.) 
From January of 2007 through September of 2007, discussions took place between the 
U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida ("the Office") and Jeffrey Epstein's 
attorneys. (DE 407 at ¶ 9.) On February I, 2007, Epstein's defense team sent a 24-page letter to 
the Office going over what they intended to present during a meeting at the Office the same day. 
(DE 407 at ¶ 10.) 
EFTA00027667
--- PAGE 3 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 435 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/21/2019 Page 3 of 33 
By March 15, 2007, the Office was sending letters to victims informing them of their 
rights pursuant to the Crime Victims' Rights Act ("CVRA"). DE 407 at ¶ 11.) By May of 2007, 
the Office had drafted an 82-page prosecution memorandum and a 53-page indictment outlining 
numerous federal sexual offenses committed by Epstein. (DE 407 at ¶ 12.) On or about June 7, 
2007, FBI agents had delivered to Jane Doe 1 a standard CVRA victim notification letter.' The 
notification letter promised that the Justice Department would make its "best efforts" to protect 
Jane Doe l's rights, including "the reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the United 
States in the case" and " to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the district court 
involving [a] ... plea." The notification further stated that, "[a]t this time, your case is under 
investigation." (DE 407 at ¶ 13.) Jane Doe 1 relied on those representations and believed that the 
Government would protect those rights and keep her informed about the progress of her case. 
(DE 407 at ¶ 14.) 
On July 6, 2007, Epstein's lawyers sent a 23-page letter lodging numerous arguments to 
persuade the Office that no federal crimes had been committed by him. (DE 407 at ¶ 15.) By 
August 3, 2007, the Government had rejected Epstein's various arguments against federal 
On or about August 11, 2006, Jane Doe 2 received the same CVRA letter. (DE 407 at 
7.) 
Initially, Jane Doe 2 was unwilling to provide any information to the FBI or the Office 
unless she was assured her statements would not be used against her. She also described Epstein 
as "an awesome man" and stated that she hoped "nothing happens to" him. (DE 415 at ¶¶ 14-
15.) This was during the time period where Jane Doe 2 had obtained counsel paid for by Epstein. 
(Jane Doe 2 Decl. ¶¶ 5-7.) 
Assistant United States Attorney ("AUSA") 
("line prosecutor" 
S") 
testified that both Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2 received letters describing their rights 
under the CVRA. Although Jane Doe 1 and 2 were given 
and the FBI agent's 
name and phone number, neither contacted either of them. (1 
Decl. ¶ 5, DE 403-19.)

charges and sent a letter to Epstein's counsel stating, "[w]e would reiterate that the agreement to 
Section 2255 [a civil restitution provision] liability applies to all of the minor girls identified 
during the federal investigation, not just the 12 that form the basis of an initial planned charging 
instrument." (DE 407 at ¶ 17.) On September 10, 2007, multiple drafts of a non-prosecution 
agreement ("NPA") had been exchanged between Epstein's counsel and the Office. (DE 407 at ¶ 
18.) 
On September 12, 2007, while attempting to create alternative charges against Epstein, 
the Office expressed concern about "the effect of taking the position that Mr. Epstein's house is 
in the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States" because the Government 
had "no evidence of any assaults occurring either on Mr. Epstein's plane or offshore from his 
residence." (DE 407 atilt 19.) On September 13, 2007, the line prosecutor emailed Epstein's 
counsel indicating an effort to come up with a solution to the aforementioned concern and she 
stated that she had been "spending some quality time with Title 18 looking for misdemeanors." 
The line prosecutor further indicated, "I know that someone mentioned there being activity on an 
airplane. I just want to make sure that there is a factual basis for the plea that the agents can 
confirm." Epstein's counsel responded, "[a]lready thinking about the same statutes." (DE 407 at 
¶ 20.) 
On September 14, 2007, after having spoken on the telephone about the subject matter 
of the September 13 emails, Epstein's counsel and the line prosecutor exchanged emails 
including a proposed plea agreement for Epstein to plead guilty to assaulting one of his 
coconspirators. (DE 407 atilt 21.) On September 15, 2007, the line prosecutor sent an email to 
the Epstein defense team raising concerns about a resolution that would not involve one of 
EFTA00027669

Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 435 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/21/2019 Page 5 of 33 
Epstein's minor victims and stating: 
I have gotten some negative reaction to the assault charge with [a 
co-conspirator] as the victim, since she is considered one of the main 
perpetrators of the offenses that we planned to charge in the 
indictment. Can you talk to Mr. Epstein about a young woman named 
[Jane Doe]? We have hearsay evidence that she traveled on Mr. 
Epstein's airplane when she was under 18, in around the 2000 or 
2001 time frame. 
(DE 407 at 122.) 
On September 16, 2007, the line prosecutor corresponded with Epstein's counsel 
about having Epstein plead guilty to obstruction of justice for pressuring one of his co-conspirators 
not to turn over evidence or complying with a previously-served grand jury subpoena. (DE 407 at 
¶ 23.) The Office also stated, "On an `avoid the press' note, I believe that Mr. Epstein's airplane was 
in Miami on the day of the [co-conspirator] telephone call. If he was in Miami-Dade County at the 
time, then I can file the charge in the District Court in Miami, which will hopefully cut the press 
coverage significantly.' They also discussed having Epstein plead guilty to a second charge of 
assaulting a different co-conspirator. (DE 407 at 1 24.) 
On September 16, 2007, the line prosecutor wrote to Epstein's counsel indicating that 
the Office did not like the factual basis for the proposed charges as the Office was "not 
investigating Mr. Epstein [for] abusing his girlfriend." (DE 407 at 1 25.) The correspondence 
further stated: 
[i.e., AUSA 
I recommended that some of the timing issues be 
addressed only in the state agreement, so that it isn't obvious to the judge that we are 
trying to create federal jurisdiction for prison purposes. 
I will include our standard language regarding resolving all criminal liability and I 
will mention `co-conspirators,' but I would prefer not to highlight for the judge all 
of the other crimes and all of the other persons that we could charge. Also, we do not

have the power to bind Immigration . . . there is no plan to try to proceed on any 
immigration charges against either Ms. [co-conspirator] or Ms. [coconspirator] 
(Ex. 7, DE 361-7.) 
In the same email, the line prosecutor wrote to defense counsel about a meeting 
outside the U.S. Attorney's Office: "Maybe we can set a time to meet. If you want to meet 'off 
campus' somewhere, that is fine." (DE 407 at ¶ 27.) On about September 16, 2007, Epstein's 
counsel provided a proposed NPA to the Government that extended immunity from federal 
prosecution not only to Epstein, but also to certain co-conspirators. (DE 407 at ¶ 28.) 
On September 17, 2007, the line prosecutor wrote to defense counsel Jay Lefkowitz: 
"Please send [a document] to my home e-mail address — [redacted] and give me a call on my cell 
[redacted] so I can be ready for some discussions tomorrow." (DE 407 at ¶ 29.) On September 17, 
2007, Lefkowitz responded: "[D]o you have another obstruction proffer I can review that you have 
drafted? Also, if we go that route, would you intend to make the deferred prosecution agreement 
public?" (DE 407 at ¶ 30.) 
On September 18, 2007, the Office responded: "A non-prosecution agreement would 
not be made public or filed with the Court, but it would remain part of our case file. It probably 
would be subject to a FOIA request, but it is not something that we would distribute without 
compulsory process." (DE 407 at ¶ 31.) On September 20, 2007, the U.S. Attorney's Office wrote: 
"On the issue about 18 USC 2255, we seem to be miles apart. Your most recent version not only had 
me binding the girls to a trust fund administered by the state court, but also promising that they will 
give up their 2255 rights.... In the context of a non-prosecution agreement, the office may be more 
willing to be specific about not pursuing charges against others." (DE 407 at ¶ 32.) 
EFTA00027671

Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 435 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/21/2019 Page 7 of 33 
On September 21, 2007, Palm Beach County State Attorney Barry Krischer wrote the line 
prosecutor about the proposed agreement and added: "Glad we could get this worked out for reasons 
I won't put in writing. After this is resolved I would love to buy you a cup at Starbucks and have a 
conversation." (DE 407 at ¶ 33.) On September 21, 2007, the line prosecutor emailed Epstein's 
counsel stating, "I think that the attached addresses the concerns about having an unlimited number 
of claimed victims, without me trying to bind girls whom I do not represent." (DE 407 at ¶ 34.) On 
September 23, 2007, the U.S. Attorney's Office sent an email to Lefkowitz stating: "It is factually 
accurate that the list we are going to give you are persons we have identified as victims. If we did 
not think they were victims, they would have no right to bring suit." (DE 407 at ¶ 35.) 
On September 24, 2007, the line prosecutor sent an e-mail to a prospective representative for 
the Epstein victims, entitled "Conflict Check." The email confirmed the girls' status as victims, 
stating: "Please keep this confidential because these are minor victims. This is a preliminary list." 
Later on September 24, 2007, the line prosecutor sent an email to Lefkowitz stating: "I have 
compiled a list of 34 confirmed minors." (DE 407 at ¶ 36.) As correspondence continued on 
September 24, 2007, and the NPA was being executed, Lefkowitz sent an email to the line 
prosecutor stating: `=I— Please do whatever you can to keep this [i.e., the NPA] from becoming 
public." (DE 407 at 1137.) 
On September 24, 2007, Epstein and the Office formally reached an agreement whereby the 
United States would defer federal prosecution in favor of prosecution by the State of Florida. 
Epstein and the Office accordingly entered into a NPA reflecting such an agreement. (DE 407 at ¶ 
38.) The NPA provided tha "the United States, in consultation with and subject to the good faith 
approval of Epstein's counsel, shall select an attorney representative for [the victims], who shall be 
EFTA00027672
--- PAGE 8 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 435 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/21/2019 Page 8 of 33 
paid for by Epstein." The NPA also provided that if any of the victims elected to bring suit under 
U.S.C. § 2255, they must agree to waive any other claim for damages. As part of the NPA, 
Epstein would not contest the jurisdiction of the United States District Court and waived his right 
to contest liability and damages. (NPA, DE 361-62.) 
Among other provisions, the NPA expanded immunity to any "potential coconspirator" 
of Epstein's: "In consideration of Epstein's agreement to plead guilty and to provide compensation 
in the manner described above, if Epstein successfully fulfills all of the terms and conditions of this 
agreement, the United States also agrees that it will not institute any criminal charges against any 
potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but not limited to 
or 
ff (DE 407 at ¶ 40.) The NPA also provided that: "The parties 
anticipate that this agreement will not be made part of any public record. If the United States receives 
a Freedom of Information Act request or any compulsory process commanding the disclosure of the 
agreement, it will provide notice to Epstein before making that disclosure." (DE 407 at ¶ 41.) 
From the time the FBI began investigating Epstein until September 24, 2007—when 
the NPA was concluded—the Office never conferred with the victims about a NPA or told the 
victims that such an agreement was under consideration. ( 
Decl. ¶ 7, DE 361-64; DE 
407 at ¶ 43.) Many, if not all, other similarly-situated victims received standard CVRA victim 
notification letters substantively identical to those sent to Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2. (DE 407 at 
¶ 44.) The Office did not consult or confer with any of the victims about the NPA before it was 
signed. (DE 407 at ¶4; 45-46.) 
Epstein' s counsel was aware that the Office was deliberately keeping the NPA secret from 
the victims and, indeed, had sought assurances to that effect. (DE 407 at ¶ 48.) After the NPA was 
EFTA00027673
--- PAGE 9 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 435 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/21/2019 Page 9 of 33 
signed, Epstein's counsel and the Office began negotiations about whether the victims would be told 
about the NPA. (DE 407 at ¶ 49.) It was a deviation from the Government's standard practice to 
negotiate with defense counsel about the extent of crime victim notifications. (DE 407 at ¶ 50.) 
On September 24, 2007, the Office sent an email to Lefkowitz: 
Thank you, Jay. I have forwarded your message only to [United States Attorney] 
Alex [Acosta], 
and 
. I don't anticipate it going any further than that. 
When I receive the originals, I will sign and return one copy to you. The other will 
be placed in the case file, which will be kept confidential since it also contains 
identifying information about the girls. 
When we reach an agreement about the attorney representative for the girls, we can 
discuss what I can tell him and the girls about the agreement. I know that 
promised Chief 
an update when a resolution was achieved.... Rolando is 
calling, but Rolando knows not to tell Chiefs 
about the money issue, just about 
what crimes Mr. Epstein is pleading guilty to and the amount of time that has been 
agreed to. Rolando also is telling Chief 
not to disclose the outcome to anyone. 
(DE 407 at' 52.) 
On September 25, 2007, the line prosecutor sent an e-mail to Lefkowitz stating: "And 
can we have a conference call to discuss what I may disclose to . . . the girls regarding the 
agreement." (DE 407 at ¶ 53.) Also on September 25, 2007, the line prosecutor sent an email to 
Lefkowitz which stated in part: "They [Ted Babbitt, Stuart Grossman, Chris Searcy, [L]ake 
Lytal] are all very good personal injury lawyers, but I have concerns about whether there would 
be an inherent tension because they may feel that THEY might make more money (and get a lot 
more press coverage) if they proceed outside the Terms of the plea agreement. (Sony — I just 
have a bias against plaintiffs' attorneys.) One nice thing about Bert is that he is in Miami where 
there has been almost no coverage of this case." (DE 407 at ¶ 54.) 
On September 26, 2007, the line prosecutor sent an e-mail to Lefkowitz in which she 
EFTA00027674
--- PAGE 10 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 435 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/21/2019 Page 10 of 33 
stated: "Hi Jay — Can you give me a call at .-[xxx-xxxx] this morning? I am meeting with the 
agents and want to give them their marching orders regarding what they can tell the girls." (DE 
407 at ¶ 55.) On September 27, 2007, the attorney representative for the victims emailed the 
Office and asked whether he could get a copy of the indictment or plea agreement to find out 
"exactly what Epstein concedes to in the civil case." (Sept. 27, 2007 email, DE 362-2.) Upon 
inquiry from the Office, Lefkowitz responded by stating that the attorney representative 
"certainly [] should not get a copy of any indictment." (DE 407 at ¶ 57.) That same day, the line 
prosecutor informed Epstein's counsel of concerns raised by the attorney representative for the 
girls. Specifically, "[t]he concern is, if all 40 girls decide they want to sue, they don't want to be 
in a situation where Mr. Epstein says this is getting too expensive, we won't pay anymore 
attorneys' fees." (DE 407 at ¶ 58.) 
Also on that same day, the line prosecutor sent an email to state prosecutors Lanna 
Belohlavek and Barry Krischer: "Can you let me know when Mr. Epstein is going to enter his 
guilty plea and what judge that will be in front of? I know the agents and I would really like to 
be there, 'incognito.'" (DE 407 at ¶ 59.) 
On October 3, 2007, the Office sent a proposed letter that would have gone to a special 
master for selecting an attorney representative for the victims under the NPA's compensation 
procedure. The letter described the facts of the Epstein case as follows: "Mr. Epstein, through his 
assistants, would recruit underage females to travel to his home in Palm Beach to engage in lewd 
conduct in exchange for money. Based upon the investigation, the United States has identified 40 
young women who can be characterized as victims pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2255. Some of those 
women went to Mr. Epstein's home only once, some went there as many as 100 times or more. Some

--- PAGE 11 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 435 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/21/2019 Page 11 of 33 
of the women's conduct was limited to performing a topless or nude massage while Mr. Epstein 
masturbated himself. For other women, the conduct escalated to full sexual intercourse." (DE 407 
at ¶ 60.) 
On October 10, 2007, Lefkowitz sent a letter to U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta stating, in 
pertinent part: "Neither federal agents nor anyone from your Office should contact the identified 
individuals to inform them of the resolution of the case, including appointment of the attorney 
representative and the settlement process. Not only would tha t violate the confidentiality of the 
agreement, but Mr. Epstein also will have no control over what is communicated to the identified 
individuals at this most critical stage. We believe it is essential that we participate in crafting 
mutually acceptable communication to the identified individuals." The letter further proposed 
that the attorney representative for the victims be instructed that "[t]he details regarding the 
United States's investigation of this matter and its resolution with Mr. Epstein is confidential. 
You may not make public statements regarding this matter." (DE 407 at ¶ 61.) 
U.S. Attorney Acosta then met with Lefkowitz for breakfast and Lefkowitz followed up with 
a letter stating, "I also want to thank you for the commitment you made to me during our October 
meeting in which you ... assured me that your Office would not ... contact any of the identified 
individuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this 
matter." (DE 407 at ¶ 63.) 
On October 24, 2007, AUSA 
sent a letter to Jay Lefkowitz, proposing an 
addendum to the NPA clarifying the procedures for the third-party representative for the victims 
under the NPA's compensation provisions. (DE 407 at ¶ 64.) On October 25, 2007, AUSA 
sent a letter to Retired Judge Davis about selecting an attorney to represent the victims tinder the 
EFTA00027676
--- PAGE 12 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 435 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/21/2019 Page 12 of 33 
NPA's compensation procedure. (DE 407 at ¶ 65.) 
On about October 26 or 27, 2007, Special Agents 
and 
met in person with Jane Doe 1. They explained that Epstein would plead guilty to state charges, he 
would be required to register as a sex offender for life, and he had made certain concessions related 
to the payment of damages. (DE 407 at ¶ 70.) According to Jane Doe 1, the Agents did not explain 
that the NPA had already been signed. (Jane Doe 1 Decl. ¶ 5, DE 361-26.) Jane Doe 1's 
understanding was that the federal investigation would continue. (Jane Doe 1 Decl. 116.) In contrast, 
Special Agent 
stated that the meeting with Jane Doe 1 was to advise her of the main 
terms of the NPA.= ( 
Decl. ¶ 8, DE 403-18.) After the meeting, Special Agent 
became concerned about what would happen if Epstein breached the NPA, and thought 
that if the victims were aware of the NPA, the provision about monetary damages could be grounds 
for impeachment of the victims and herself. (- 
Decl. 1 9.) According to Special Agent 
the investigation of Epstein continued through 2008. (M 
Decl. ¶ II.) 
In addition to Jane Doe I, FBI agents only talked to two other victims out of the 34 
identified victims about the "general terms" of the NPA, including the provision providing a 
federal civil remedy to the victims. (DE 407 at ¶ 76.) After these meetings with three victims, 
Epstein's defense team complained. (DE 407 at ¶ 77.) 
On about November 27, 2007, AUSA 
sent an e-mail to Lefkowitz, (with a 
copy to U.S. Attorney Acosta) stating that the Office had a statutory obligation to notify the victims 
about Epstein's plea to state charges that was part of the NPA: 
Special Agent 
also stated that on August 7, 2007, Jane Doe 1 never asked to 
confer with anyone from the government about charging decisions or any resolution of the 
matter. (El

The United States has a statutory obligation (Justice for All Act of 2004) to notify the 
victims of the anticipated upcoming events and their rights associated with the 
agreement entered into by the United States and Mr. Epstein in a timely fashion. 
Tomorrow will make one full week since you were formally notified of the selection. 
I must insist that the vetting process come to an end. Therefore, unless you provide 
me with a good faith objection to Judge Davis's selection [as special master for 
selecting legal counsel for victims pursuing claims against Epstein] by COB 
tomorrow, November 28, 2007, I will authorize the notification of the victims. 
Should you give me the go-head on [victim representative] . . . selection by COB 
tomorrow, I will simultaneously send you a draft of the letter. I intend to notify the 
victims by letter after COB Thursday, November 29th. 
(DE 407 at 179.) 
On November 28, 2007, the Government sent an email to Lefkowitz attaching a letter 
dated November 29, 2007 (the apparent date upon which it was intended to be mailed) and 
explained that "I am writing to inform you that the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein has 
been completed, and Mr. Epstein and the U.S. Attorney's Office have reached an agreement 
containing the following terms." The proposed letter then spelled out a number of the provisions 
in the NPA, including that because Epstein's plea of guilty to state charges was "part of the 
resolution of the federal investigation," the victims were "entitled to be present and to make a 
statement under oath at the state sentencing." (DE 407 at ¶ 80.) 
On November 29, 2007, Lefkowitz sent a letter to U.S. Attorney Acosta objecting to the 
proposed victim notification letter, stating that it is inappropriate for any letter to be sent to the 
victims before Epstein entered his plea or had been sentenced. Lefkowitz also told the Government 
that the victims should not be invited to the state sentencing, that they should not be encouraged to 
contact law enforcement officials, and that encouraging the attorney representative to do anything 
other than get paid by Epstein to settle the cases was to encourage an ethical conflict. (DE 407 at ¶

82.) 
On about November 30, 2007, U.S. Attorney Acosta sent a letter to one of Epstein's 
defense attorneys, Kenneth Starr, stating: "I am directing our prosecutors not to issue victim 
notification letters until this Friday at 5 p.m., to provide you with time to review these options 
with your client." The letter also explained that the line prosecutor had informed U.S. Attorney 
Acosta "that the victims were not told of the availability of Section 2255 relief during the 
investigation phase of this matter" despite the fact that the "[r]ule of law . . now requires this 
District to consider the victims' rights under this statute in negotiating this Agreement." (DE 407 at 
¶ 83.) On December 5, 2007, Starr sent a letter to U.S. Attorney Acosta (with copy to AUSA 
asking about issuance of victim notification letters and stating: "While we believe that it 
is wholly inappropriate for your Office to send this letter under any circumstances 
inappropriate to issue this letter without affording us the right to review it." ( 
it is certainly 
DE 407 at ¶ 85.) 
On about December 6, 2007, AUSA 
sent a letter to Lefkowitz stating in part: 
[E]ach of the listed individuals are persons whom the Office identified as victims. 
[T] he Office is prepared to indict Mr. Epstein based upon Mr. Epstein's `interactions' 
with these individuals. This conclusion is based upon a thorough and proper 
investigation - one in which none of the victims was informed of any right to receive 
damages of any amount prior to the investigation of her claim. 
[T]he Office can say, without hesitation, that the evidence demonstrates that each 
person on the list was a victim of Mr. Epstein's criminal behavior. 
Finally, let me address your objections to the draft Victim Notification Letter. You 
write that you don't understand the basis for the Office's belief that it is appropriate 
to notify the victims. Pursuant to the 'Justice for All Act of 2004,' crime victims are 
entitled to: 'The right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court 
proceeding ... involving the crime' and the 'right not to be excluded from any such 
public court proceeding....' 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(2) & (3). Section 3771 also 
commands that 'employees of the Department ofJustice ... engaged in the detection, 
investigation, or prosecution of crime shall make their best efforts to see that crime 
EFTA00027679
--- PAGE 15 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 435 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/21/2019 Page 15 of 33 
victims are notified of, and accorded, the rights described in subsection (a).' 18 
U.S.C. § 3771(c)(1).... 
With respect to notification of the other information that we propose to disclose, the 
statute requires that we provide a victim with the earliest possible notice of: the status 
of the investigation, the filing of charges against a suspected offender, and the 
acceptance of a plea. 42 U.S.C. 10607(c)(3). Just as in 18 U.S.C. 3771, these sections 
are not limited to proceedings in a federal district court. Our Non-Prosecution 
Agreement resolves the federal investigation by allowing Mr. Epstein to plead to a 
state offense. The victims identified through the federal investigation should be 
appropriately informed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does not require the 
U.S. Attorney's Office to forego its legal obligations. [T]he Office believes that it has 
proof beyond a reasonable doubt that each listed individual was a victim of Mr. 
Epstein's criminal conduct while the victim was a minor. The law requires us to treat 
all victims "with fairness and with respect for the victim's dignity and privacy." 18 
U.S.C. 3771(a)(8). 
The letter included a footnote stating: "Unlike the State's investigation, the federal investigation 
shows criminal conduct by Mr. Epstein at least as early as 2001, so all of the victims were 
minors at the time of the offense." (DE 407 at ¶ 83.) 
On December 7, 2007, defense attorney Lilly Ann Sanchez sent a letter to AUSA 
requesting "that the Office hold off on sending any victim notification letters." No letters 
were sent in December of 2007. (DE 407 at ¶ 88.) On December 13, 2007, the line prosecutor sent 
a letter to Lefkowitz stating that "You raised objections to any victim notification, and no 
further notifications were done." (DE 407 at ¶ 89.) On December 19, 2007, U.S. Attorney Acosta 
sent a letter to Lilly Ann Sanchez stating, "I understand that the defense objects to the victims being 
given notice of time and place of Mr. Epstein's state court sentencing hearing. We intend to provide 
victims with notice of the federal resolution, as required by law. We will defer to the discretion of 
the State Attorney regarding whether he wishes to provide victims with notices of the state 
proceedings. (DE 407 at ¶ 90.)

In January of 2008, any requirement that Epstein carry out his obligations under the NPA was 
delayed while he sought higher level review within the Justice Department. (DE 407 at ¶ 92.) On 
January 10, 2008, Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2 were sent victim notification letters from the FBI 
advising them that "[t]his case is currently under investigation. This can be a lengthy process and 
we request your continued patience while we conduct a thorough investigation." (DE 407 at ¶ 93.) 
The January 10, 2008 notification letters did not disclose that the Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2 case 
in the Southern District of Florida was the subject of the NPA entered into by Epstein and the Office, 
or that there had been any potentially binding resolution. (DE 407 at ¶ 94.) Other victims received 
the same letters as sent to Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2. (DE 407 at ¶ 95.) 
According to the declaration ofJane Doe 1, she believed that criminal prosecution of Epstein 
was important and she wanted to be consulted by prosecutors before any resolution. Based on the 
letters received, she believed the Government would contact her before reaching any final 
resolution. (Jane Doe 1 Decl. ¶ 9.) On January 31, 2008, Jane Doe 1 met with FBI Agents and an 
AUSA from the U.S. Attorney's Office. She provided additional details of Epstein's sexual abuse 
of her. The AUSA did not disclose to Jane Doe 1 at this meeting that they had already negotiated 
a NPA with Epstein. (DE 407 at ¶ 97.) According to the declaration of Jane Doe 2, while she 
recognizes she did not initially help the investigation, she later tried to cooperate with the 
investigation but was never given an opportunity to cooperate with the investigation.' (Jane Doe 2 
The Government believed that a negotiated resolution was in the best interest of the 
Office and the victims as a whole based on information obtained from the victims and the agents 
assigned to the case. 
Decl. ¶ 19.) The Government also believed that Epstein was 
trying to set aside the NPA and therefore the Government needed to be prepared for a 
prosecution. 
Decl. ¶ 34.) Petitioners object to this evidence, claiming the Government 
previously claimed work product and similar protections over internal materials. Given that the 
Court is ruling in favor of Petitioners on the present motions, the Court need not address this

Decl. ' 13-14, DE 361-27.) 
On March 19, 2008, the line prosecutor sent a lengthy email to a prospective pro bono 
attorney for one of Epstein's victims who had been subpoenaed to appear at a deposition. The email 
listed the attorneys representing Epstein, the targets of the investigation, and recounted in detail the 
investigation that had been conducted to that point. The email did not reveal the fact that Epstein had 
signed the NPA in September 2007. (DE 407 at' 98.) 
On May 30, 2008, Jane Doe 5, who was recognized as an Epstein victim by the Office, 
received a letter from the FBI advising her that "[t]his case is currently under investigation. This can 
be a lengthy process and we request your continued patience while we conduct a thorough 
investigation." (DE 407 at 1199.) The May 30, 2008 victim letter to Jane Doe 5 also acknowledged 
the victims' rights under the CVRA . (DE 407 at 11100.) 
In mid-June of 2008, Mr. Bradley Edwards, the attorney for Petitioners, contacted the line 
prosecutor to inform her that he represented Jane Doe 1 and, later, Jane Doe 2. Edwards asked to 
meet to provide information about the federal crimes committed by Epstein against these victims. 
The line prosecutor and Edwards discussed the possibility of federal charges being filed in the future. 
Edwards was led to believe federal charges could still be filed, with no mention whatsoever of the 
existence of the NPA or any other possible resolution to the case. (DE 407 at 11101.) 
At the end of the call, the line prosecutor asked Edwards to send any information 
that he wanted considered by the Office in determining whether to file federal charges. The line 
prosecutor did not inform Edwards about the NPA. (DE 407 at ¶ 102.) On June 19, 2008, Edwards 
issue. To the extent it might have an impact on future rulings, Petitioners may reassert this 
argument if and when appropriate.

Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 435 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/21/2019 Page 18 of 33 
sent an email to the line prosecutor requesting to meet and discuss plans. (DE 407 at ¶ 103.) 
On June 23, 2008, the line prosecutor sent an email to Lefkowitz stating that the 
Deputy Attorney General had completed his review of the Epstein matter and "determined that 
federal prosecution of Mr. Epstein's case [wa]s appropriate. Accordingly, Mr. Epstein ha[d] until 
the close of business on Monday, June 30, 2008, to comply with the terms and conditions of the 
agreement between the United States and Mr. Epstein." (DE 407 at ¶ 105.) 
On or about June 27, 2008, the Office called Edwards to provide notice to his clients 
regarding the entry of Epstein's guilty plea in state court. (DE 407 at 1 107.) According to Edwards, 
the line prosecutor only told him that Epstein was pleading guilty to state solicitation of prosecution. 
He was not told that the state plea was related to the federal investigation or that the state plea would 
resolve the federal crimes. Edwards claims he was not told his clients could address the state court. 
(Edwards Decl. ¶¶17-18, DE 416-1.) In contrast, the line prosecutor claims she told Edwards that 
his clients could address the state court. 
Decl. ¶ 38, DE 403-19.) 
On or before June 30, 2008, the Office prepared a draft victim notification to be sent 
to the victims. The notification was designed to inform the victims of the provisions of the deferral 
of federal prosecution in favor of state charges. The notification letter began by describing Epstein's 
guilty plea in the past tense: "On June 30, 2008, Jeffrey Epstein ... entered a plea of guilty to 
violations of Florida statutes forbidding the solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution and 
felony solicitation of prostitution." Later, a substantively identical letter was prepared for Epstein's 
and his counsel's review. (DE 407 at ¶ 110.) 
On June 30, 2008, the Office sent an e-mail to Epstein's counsel: "The FBI has received 
several calls regarding the Non-Prosecution Agreement. I do not know whether the title of the 
EFTA00027683
--- PAGE 19 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 435 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/21/2019 Page 19 of 33 
document was disclosed when the Agreement was filed under seal, but the FBI and our office are 
declining comment if asked." (DE 407 at ¶ III.) That same day, Epstein pled guilty to state law 
solicitation of prostitution charges. (DE 407 at ¶ 112.) Immediately following the June 30, 2008 
hearing, the line prosecutor told one of the victims' attorneys that Epstein had "pled guilty today in 
state court." (DE 407 at ¶ 113.) Also after the plea, the line prosecutor emailed the assistant state 
attorney a copy of the NPA to be filed under seal. (July 1, 2008 email, DE 362-38.) 
On June 30, 2008, based on what she had been told by the Government, Jane Doe 1 
thought that the Office was still investigating and pursuing her case. She did not receive notice 
that Epstein's state guilty plea affected her rights in any way. If she had been told that the state 
plea had some connection to blocking the prosecution of her case, she would have attended and 
tried to object to the judge to prevent that plea from going forward. (Jane Doe 1 Decl. ¶ 13.) 
According to the line prosecutor, Edwards did not tell her that Jane Doe I wanted to meet with her 
before a resolution was reached. 
Decl. ¶ 37, DE 403-19.) 
On July 3, 2008, as specifically directed by the Office, Edwards sent a letter to the Office 
communicating the wishes of Jane Doe 1, Jane Doe 2, and Jane Doe 5 that federal charges be filed 
against Epstein: "We urge the Attorney General and our United States Attorney to consider the 
fundamental import of the vigorous enforcement of our Federal laws. We urge you to move forward 
with the traditional indictments and criminal prosecution commensurate with the crimes Mr. Epstein 
has committed, and we further urge you to take the steps necessary to protect our children from this 
very dangerous sexual predator." (DE 407 at ¶ 118.) 
On July 7, 2008, the line prosecutor corresponded with Epstein's counsel seeking his signed 
agreement concerning a notification letter to the victims before beginning the distribution of that 
EFTA00027684
--- PAGE 20 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 435 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/21/2019 Page 20 of 33 
letter. (DE 407 at ¶ 120.) That same day, Jane Doe 1 filed an emergency petition for enforcement 
of her rights under the CVRA. (DE 407 at ¶ 126.) On July 9, 2008, Edwards saw the first reference 
to the NPA when the Government filed its responsive pleading to Jane Doe's emergency petition. 
(Edwards Decl. ¶ 21.) 
On July 8, 2008, the line prosecutor sent a letter to Epstein's counsel stating that 
victims would be informed about the civil compensation provision of the NPA the next day: 
In accordance with the terms of the Non-Prosecution Agreement, on June 30, 
2008, the United States Attorney's Office provided you with a list of thirty-one 
individuals "whom it was prepared to name in an Indictment as victims of an 
enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein." ... In deference to your vacation, we 
allowed you a week to provide us with any objections or requested modifications 
of the list and/or the Notification language. Yesterday, I contacted you via 
telephone and e-mail, but received no response. Accordingly, the United States 
hereby notifies you that it will distribute the victim notifications tomorrow, July 9, 
2008, to each of the thirty-two identified victims, either directly or via their 
counsel. 
(DE 407 at ¶ 127.) 
On July 9, 2008, Epstein's counsel sent a letter to the line prosecutor raising concerns 
about the notifications, and suggesting modifications to the notification letter. Epstein's counsel 
also objected to the victim notification letters containing certain information about the NPA. (DE 
407 at ¶ 128.) The line prosecutor responded: "Without such an express Acknowledgment by 
Mr. Epstein that the notice contains the substance of that Agreement, I believe that the victims 
will have justification to petition for the entire agreement, which is contrary to the confidentiality 
clause that the parties have signed." (DE 407 at ¶ 129.) That same day, the U.S. Attorney's 
Office sent victim notification letters to Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 5, via their attorney, Edwards, 
and to other identified victims of Epstein. That notification contained a written explanation of 
EFTA00027685
--- PAGE 21 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 435 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/21/2019 Page 21 of 33 
some of the civil compensation provisions of the NPA. The notification did not provide the full 
terms of the NPA. 
On July 10, 2008, Epstein's counsel continued to protest victim notification as 
evidenced by an email to the line prosecutor stating, "we respectfully request a reasonable 
opportunity to review and comment on a draft of the modified notification letter you intend to 
mail before you send it." (DE 407 at ¶ 131.) 
On August 10, 2008, Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2 filed a motion seeking release of the 
NPA. (DE 407 at ¶ 136.) On August 14, 2008, the line prosecutor emailed Epstein's counsel 
stating that the court has "ordered us to make the Agreement available to the plaintiffs." (DE 407 
at I 141.) 
On August 18, 2008, Lefkowitz wrote the line prosecutor that Epstein objected to 
disclosure of the terms of the NPA, but that Epstein would "cooperate with the government to 
reach an agreement as to substance of the notification to be sent to the government's list of 
individuals. Based on the Agreement, the information contained in the notification should be 
limited to (1) the language provided in the Agreement dealing with civil restitution (paragraphs 
7-10) and (2) the contact information of the selected attorney representative. We object to the 
inclusion of additional information about the investigation of Mr. Epstein, the terms of the 
Agreement other than paragraphs 7-10 and the identity of other identified individuals. ' (DE 407 
at ¶ 143.) On August 21, 2008, the Government sent a letter to Epstein's counsel stating that, 
"[c]opies of the victim notifications will continue to be provided to counsel for Mr. Epstein." 
Jane Doe 2 was not informed of the contents of the NPA until August 28, 2008, when the 
line prosecutor provided a copy to Edwards. (DE 407 atilt 146.) On September 2, 2008, the line

--- PAGE 22 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 435 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/21/2019 Page 22 of 33 
prosecutor sent an email to Epstein's counsel stating, "I will start sending out the victim 
notifications today. In accordance with your request, I have changed the language regarding the 
victims' right to receive a copy of the Agreement." (DE 407 at ¶ 147.) On September 2 and 3, 
2008, the Office sent to Jane Doe 1 and other identified victims amended notification letters, 
stating "the United States has agreed to defer federal prosecution in favor of this state plea and 
sentence." (Sept. 3, 2008 letter, DE 363-66; (DE 407 at ¶ 148.) 
On September 16, 2008, attorney Jeffrey Herman, who represented several Epstein 
victims, wrote to the line prosecutor to object to the restitution procedures established in the 
NPA after learning that another attorney, established through the NPA, would be making 
unsolicited contacts to the victims. Mr. Herman explained that the notification letters were 
"misleading" because they referred generally to a waiver of "any other claim for damages," 
without informing them that this waiver might include a valuable punitive damages claim against 
an alleged billionaire. (DE 407 at ¶ 152.) On September 17, 2008, the line prosecutor sent an 
email to State Attorney Barry Krischer, explaining that the NPA "contain[ed] a confidentiality 
provision that require[ed] us to inform Mr. Epstein's counsel before making any disclosure." 
(DE 407 at ¶ 153.) 
Around this same time period, Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2 filed actions in Palm Beach 
County, seeking money damages from Epstein from sexually abusing them. (Petitioners' Resp. to 
Gov't's Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (hereinafter "DE 415") at ¶ ¶ 8-9.) Eventually, 
they received monetary settlements of their lawsuits. (DE 415 at ¶ 12.) 
In moving for summary judgment, the Petitioners make the following arguments in 
support of their contention that the Government violated their CVRA rights. The Government 
EFTA00027687
--- PAGE 23 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 435 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/21/2019 Page 23 of 33 
violated Petitioners' right to confer under the CVRA: (1) when the Government was negotiating 
and signing the NPA; (2) when the Government sent letters telling Petitioners to be patient while 
the Government completed its investigation and (3) when the Government did not tell the victims 
that the state plea would extinguish the federal case. Petitioners also claim the Government 
violated their right to be treated with fairness under the CVRA by concealing the negotiations of 
the NPA. Additionally, Petitioners contend the Government violated their rights to reasonable 
and accurate notice when it concealed that the NPA and the federal investigation were implicated 
in the state court proceeding. 
In moving for and responding to summary judgment, the Government contends that there 
is no right to notice or conferral about a NPA; it was reasonable for the Government to send 
letters to victims while continuing to investigate the case because the Government could not 
assume that Epstein would plead guilty; and the line prosecutor contacted Petitioners' attorneys 
about the state court plea hearing. The Government also claims it did not violate the right to 
reasonable, accurate and timely notice because the CVRA does not create any right to notice of 
state court proceedings and, in any event, the Government gave notice. The Government asserts 
it did not treat the victims unfairly and used its best efforts to comply with the CVRA, including 
complying with the Attorney General's guidelines for victim assistance. Furthermore, the 
Government argues that Petitioners are equitably estopped from challenging the NPA because 
they relied upon the NPA in their state court civil actions against Epstein. Lastly, the 
Government contends that Petitioners are judicially estopped from challenging the validity of the 
NPA because they have asserted mutually inconsistent positions; namely, that the NPA is invalid 
in federal court but was binding on Epstein in state court.

II. Summary Judgment Standard 
The Court may grant summary judgment "if the movant shows that there is no genuine 
dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." Fed. 
R. Civ. P. 56(a). The stringent burden of establishing the absence of a genuine issue of material 
fact lies with the moving party. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986). The Court 
should not grant summary judgment unless it is clear that a trial is unnecessary, Anderson v. 
Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255 (1986), and any doubts in this regard should be resolved 
against the moving party. Adickes v. S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 157 (1970). 
The movant "bears the initial responsibility of informing the district court of the basis for 
its motion, and identifying those portions of [the record] which it believes demonstrate the 
absence of a genuine issue of material fact." Celotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 323. To discharge this 
burden, the movant must point out to the Court that there is an absence of evidence to support the 
nonmoving party's case. Id. at 325. 
After the movant has met its burden under Rule 56(a), the burden of production shifts and 
the nonmoving party "must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as 
to the material facts." Matsushita Electronic Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 
586 (1986). "A party asserting that a fact cannot be or is genuinely disputed must support the 
assertion by citing to particular parts of materials in the record . . . or showing that the materials 
cited do not establish the absence or presence of a genuine dispute, or that an adverse party 
cannot produce admissible evidence to support the fact." Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1)(A) and (B). 
Essentially, so long as the non-moving party has had an ample opportunity to conduct 
discovery, it must come forward with affirmative evidence to support its claim. Anderson 477 
EFTA00027689
--- PAGE 25 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 435 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/21/2019 Page 25 of 33 
U.S. at 257. "A mere 'scintilla' of evidence supporting the opposing party's position will not 
suffice; there must be enough of a showing that the jury could reasonably find for that party." 
Walker v. Darby, 911 F.2d 1573, 1577 (11th Cir. 1990). If the evidence advanced by the non-
moving party "is merely colorable, or is not significantly probative, then summary judgment may 
be granted." Anderson 477 U.S. 242, 249-50. 
III. Discussion 
The CVRA was designed to protect victims' rights and ensure their involvement in the 
criminal justice process. United States v. Moussaoui, 483 F.3d 220, 234 (4th Cir. 2007); Kenna 
v. U.S. Dist. Court, 435 F.3d 1011, 1016 (9th Cir. 2006) ("The [CVRA] was enacted to make 
crime victims full participants in the criminal justice system."). The statute enumerates the 
following ten rights: 
(1) The right to be reasonably protected from the accused. 
(2) The right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court 
proceeding, or any parole proceeding, involving the crime or of any release or escape 
of the accused. 
(3) The right not to be excluded from any such public court proceeding, unless the 
court, after receiving clear and convincing evidence, determines that testimony by the 
victim would be materially altered if the victim heard other testimony at that 
proceeding. 
(4) The right to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the district court 
involving release, plea, sentencing, or any parole proceeding. 
(5) The reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the Government in the case. 
(6) The right to full and timely restitution as provided in law. 
(7) The right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay. 
(8) The right to be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim's dignity and

privacy. 
(9) The right to be informed in a timely manner of any plea bargain or deferred 
prosecution agreement. 
(10) The right to be informed of the rights under this section and the services 
described in section 503(c) of the Victims' Rights and Restitution Act of 1990 (42 
U.S.C. 10607(c)) and provided contact information for the Office of the Victims' 
Rights Ombudsman of the Department of Justice. 
U.S.C. § 377I(a). 
This Court previously held the following with respect to the CVRA: First, the rights 
under the CVRA attach before the Government brings formal charges against a defendant. 
v. United States 817 F. Supp. 2d 1337, 1341 (S.D. Fla. 2011). 
Does 
Second, the CVRA authorizes the 
rescission or "reopening" of a prosecutorial agreement, including a non-prosecution agreement, 
reached in violation of a prosecutor's conferral obligations under the statute. 
States, 950 F. Supp. 2d 1262, 1267 (S.D. Fla. 2013). 
Doe v. United 
Third, section 3771(d)(5) of the CVRA 
authorizes the setting aside of pre-charge prosecutorial agreements, despite the fact that the 
particular statutory enforcement provision expressly refers to the reopening of a plea or sentence. 
Id. at 1267. Fourth, the "reasonable right to confer ... in the case" extends to the pre-charge 
state of criminal investigations and proceedings. Id. Fifth, the federal sex offense crimes 
involving minors allegedly committed by Epstein renders these Petitioners crime victims under 
the CVRA. Id. at 1269. Sixth, "questions pertaining to [the] equitable defense[s] are properly 
left for resolution after development of a full evidentiary record." Id. at 1269 n. 6. 
Here, it is undisputed that the Government entered into a NPA with Epstein without 
conferring with Petitioners during its negotiation and signing. Instead, the Government sent 
letters to the victims requesting their "patience" with the investigation even after the Government 
EFTA00027691
--- PAGE 27 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 435 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/21/2019 Page 27 of 33 
entered into the NPA. At a bare minimum, the CVRA required the Government to inform 
Petitioners that it intended to enter into an agreement not to prosecute Epstein. A Ithough the 
binding effect of the NPA was contingent upon Epstein pleading guilty to the state charges, that 
contingency was out of the control of the Government. The Government's hands were 
permanently tied if Epstein fulfilled his obligations under the NPA. Thus, Petitioners and the 
other victims should have been notified of the Government's intention to take that course of 
action before it bound itself under the NPA. Had the Petitioners been informed about the 
Government's intention to forego federal prosecution of Epstein in deference to him pleading 
guilty to state charges, Petitioners could have conferred with the attorney for the Government and 
provided input. In re Dean 527 F.3d 391, 394 (51b Cir. 2008) (there are rights under the CVRA 
including the "reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the Government"). Hence, the 
Government would have been able to "ascertain the victims' views on the possible details of the 
[non-prosecution agreement]." Id. Indeed, it is this type of communication between prosecutors 
and victims that was intended by the passage of the CVRA. See United States v. Heaton 458 F. 
Supp. 2d 1271 (D. Utah 2006)(government motion to dismiss charge of using facility of 
interstate commerce to entice minors to engage in unlawful sexual activity would not be granted 
until government consulted with victim); United States v. Iograssia No. CR-04-0455ADSJO, 
2005 WL 2875220, at *17 n. 11 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 7, 2005) (Senate debate supports the view that 
the contemplated mechanism for victims to obtain information on which to base their input was 
conferral with the prosecutor concerning any critical stage or disposition of the case). 
Particularly problematic was the Government's decision to conceal the existence of the 
EFTA00027692
--- PAGE 28 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 435 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/21/2019 Page 28 of 33 
NPA and mislead the victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility.' When 
the Government gives information to victims, it cannot be misleading. While the Government 
spent untold hours negotiating the terms and implications of the NPA with Epstein's attorneys, 
scant information was shared with victims. Instead, the victims were told to be "patient" while 
the investigation proceeded. 
The Government, however, interprets the CVRA as only obligating the prosecutor to 
answer inquiries by a crime victim and does not impose a duty on the prosecutor to give notice 
about case developments, other than what is required in section 3771(a)(2). Such an 
interpretation is in direct contravention of the intent of the CVRA. See Ingrassia 2005 WL 
2875220, at *17 n.11 (Senate debate explaining the right to confer is "intended to be expansive" 
including the right of victim to confer "concerning any critical state of disposition of the case"). 
In any event, no meaningful conferral could take place as long as the Government chose to 
conceal the existence of the NPA from the victims.' 
Nor does the Court agree with the Government that the 2015 amendment to the CVRA, 
section 3771(a)(9), which gave victims the "right to be informed in a timely manner of any plea 
' Even if the Court accepted the Government's version of the facts relative to the Agent 
having told Jane Doe 1 the "main terms" of the NPA (which is left undefined), the victims were 
not told about it until after it was signed and the Government was bound. This precluded the 
Government from obtaining any input from the victims. 
The Government devotes time to distinguishing between the words "confer" and 
"notice" and suggesting that "confer" is more limited in scope than "notice." Nothing about the 
definition of confer, however, suggests it is limited to one party bearing the burden of 
communication. See Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.corn/ 
dictionary (last visited January 7, 2019) ("to compare views or take counsel"); Blacks Law 
Dictionary (10* ed. 2014) ("to hold a conference, to consult with one another").

bargain or deferred prosecution agreement" specifically excluded the right of victims to be 
informed of a non-prosecution agreement. Prior to this amendment, this Court held that the right 
to confer extended to the pre-charge state of criminal investigations and proceedings. Doe, 950 
F. Supp. 2d at 1267; see also 157 Cong. Rec. 57060-01, 157 Cong. Rec. S7060-01, S7060 
(CVRA co-sponsor Senator Jon Kyl's 2011 letter to the Attorney General, explaining that 
"Congress intended the CVRA to broadly protect crime victims throughout the criminal justice 
process-from the investigative phases to the final conclusion of a case.") 
The 2015 amendment did not serve to repeal or restrict the obligations of the Government 
to confer with victims in the early stages of a case. Instead, the 2015 amendment clarified that 
certain events, such as plea agreements or deferred prosecution agreements, must be conveyed to 
the crime victim. Put another way, the 2015 amendment codified what the courts had been 
interpreting the CVRA to require, such as entitlement to notice of a plea bargain. ee In re Dean 
527 F.3d at 394 ("the government should have fashioned a reasonable way to inform the victims 
of the likelihood of criminal charges and to ascertain the victims' views on the possible details of 
a plea bargain"); United States v. Okun, No. CRIM. 3:08CR132, 2009 WL 790042, at *2 (E.D. 
Va. Mar. 24, 2009) (the statutory language of the CVRA gives the victims' rights before the 
accepting of plea agreements). 
To the extent the Government relies upon the "interpretive canon, expressio unius est 
exclusio alterius, 'expressing one item of [an] associated group or series excludes another left 
unmentioned' the Court is not persuaded. Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Echazabal, 536 U.S. 73, 80 
(2002) (quoting United States v. Vonn, 535 U.S. 55, 65 (2002)). "The force of any negative 
implication ... depends on context." Marx v. General Revenue Corp., 568 U.S. 371, 381 (2013). 
EFTA00027694
--- PAGE 30 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 435 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/21/2019 Page 30 of 33 
"[T]he expressio unius canon does not apply unless it is fair to suppose that Congress considered 
the unnamed possibility and meant to say no to it, and that the canon can be overcome by 
contrary indications that adopting a particular rule or statute was probably not meant to signal 
any exclusion." Id. (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). 
The expansive context of the CVRA lends itself to only one interpretation; namely, that 
victims should be notified of significant events resulting in resolution of their case without a 
trial. See Kenna v. U.S. Dist. Court for C.D.Cal., 435 F.3d 1011, 1016 (9th Cir. 2006) ("[t]he 
statute was enacted to make crime victims full participants in the criminal justice system"); 
Heaton 458 F. Supp. 2d at 1273 (the right to confer is "not limited to particular proceedings" but 
is "expansive" and applies broadly to "any critical stage or disposition of the case"). Reading 
into the statute a negative implication that victims need not be informed of non-prosecution 
agreements, and only informed of the more common events of plea bargains or deferred 
prosecution agreements, would be inconsistent with the goal of the CVRA.6 In the context of 
plea agreements, the CVRA provides victims with rights prior to the acceptance of plea 
agreements. See In re Dean 527 F.3d at 394; United States v. Okun, No. CRIM. 3:08CR132, 
2009 WL 790042, at *2 (E.D. Va. Mar. 24, 2009). Furthermore, victims obtain rights under the 
CVRA even before prosecution. Okum, 2009 WL 790042, at *2 (citing In re Dean, 527 F.3d at 
394). Based on this authority, the Court concludes tha 
non-prosecution agreements. 
t the CVRA must extend to conferral about 
A NPA entered into without notice has a more damaging impact on the victims than a 
plea agreement entered into without notice. When a plea agreement is entered into without 
notice, the victims will at least have an opportunity to provide input to a judge at sentencing. 
Once a NPA is entered into without notice, the matter is closed and the victims have no 
opportunity to be heard regarding any aspect of the case. 
EFTA00027695
--- PAGE 31 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 435 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/21/2019 Page 31 of 33 
Next, the Government claims it did not violate the right to confer when, in January of 
2008, it sent letters to the victims counseling patience because, at that time, Epstein's attorneys 
were seeking review of the NPA at higher levels within the Department of Justice. As indicated 
previously, however, at this point, the Government had bound itself to the terms of the NPA 
unless Epstein failed to comply with its terms. It was a material omission for the Government to 
suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an investigation about which it had 
already bound itself not to prosecute. While Epstein was within his rights to attempt to persuade 
higher authorities within the Department of Justice to overrule the prosecutorial decisions of the 
U. S. Attorney's Office in the Southern District of Florida, the CVRA was designed to give the 
victims the same opportunity to attempt to affect prosecutorial decisions before they became 
final. Instead, the Office engaged in lengthy negotiations with Epstein that included repeated 
assurances that the NPA would not be "made public or filed with the Court." (DE 407 at ¶ 31.) 
Nor did the Justice Department guidelines create an exemption from the CRVA's 
statutory requirements. Although the Government points to guidelines that conflicted with the 
requirements of the CVRA (by restricting CVRA rights until after a formal indictment), the 
Court is not persuaded that the guidelines were the basis for the Government's decision to 
withhold information about the NPA from the victims. If that had been the case, the Government 
would not have sent the victim letters telling them that they had rights protected under the 
CVRA. Nor would they have told Epstein's attorneys that it had obligations to notify the victims. 
In any event, an agency's own "'interpretation' of a statute cannot supersede the language chosen 
by Congress." Mohasco Corp. v. Silver, 447 U.S. 807, 825 (1980). 
Next, the Court rejects the Government's contention that Jane Doe 2 is not protected by 
EFTA00027696
--- PAGE 32 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 435 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/21/2019 Page 32 of 33 
the CVRA because she made statements favorable to Epstein early in the investigation.' There is 
no dispute that Epstein sexually abused Jane Doe 2 while she was a minor. Therefore, regardless 
of her comments to the prosecutor, she was a victim. See 18 U.S.C. § 3771(e) (the CVRA 
defines a victim as "a person directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of a 
Federal offense"); In re Stewart, 552 F.3d 1285, 1288 (11th Cir. 2008) ("to determine a crime 
victim, then, first, we identify the behavior constituting 'commission of a Federal offense.' 
Second, we identify the direct and proximate effects of that behavior on parties other than the 
United States. If the criminal behavior causes a party direct and proximate harmful effects, the 
party is a victim under the CVRA."). 
The Court need not resolve the factual questions surrounding what and when the victims 
were told about the state court proceeding and whether a state court proceeding is covered by the 
CVRA. Under the facts of this case, once the Government failed to advise the victims about its 
intention to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred. 
Nor does the Court need to consider the Government's estoppel arguments at this time. 
These arguments relate only to the remedy, and not the determination of whether there was a 
CVRA violation. Therefore, the Court will address this issue at the appropriate juncture. 
Lastly, the Court will address the Government's argument that its prosecutorial discretion 
permitted it to enter into the NPA. The Government correctly notes that the CVRA provides that 
Injothing in this chapter shall be construed to impair the prosecutorial discretion of the Attorney 
General or any officer under his direction." 18 U.S.C.A. § 3771(d)(6). The Court is not ruling 
In fact, the Office considered Jane Doe 2 a victim as early as August of 2006 when it 
sent her a CVRA letter. 
EFTA00027697
--- PAGE 33 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 435 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/21/2019 Page 33 of 33 
that the decision not to prosecute was improper. The Court is simply ruling that, under the facts 
of this case, there was a violation of the victims rights under the CVRA. 
IV. Conclusion 
Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED AND ADJUDGED as follows: 
I) 
Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment (DE 361) is 
GRANTED to the extent that Petitioners' right to conferral under the CVRA was 
violated. 
2) 
The United States's Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment (DE 408) is DENIED. 
3) 
Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2's Motion to Compel Answers (DE 348) is DENIED 
WITHOUT PREJUDICE. 
4) 
Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2's Motion for Finding Waiver of Work Product and 
Similar Protections by Government and for Production of Documents (DE 414) is 
DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE. 
5) 
The parties should confer and inform the Court within 15 days of the date of 
entry of this Order how they wish to proceed on determining the issue of what 
remedy, if any, should be applied in view of the violation. 
DONE AND ORDERED in Chambers at West Palm Beach, Palm Beach County, 
Florida, this 21g day of February, 2019.

1. On the "key" letter — would it be possible to include a sentence on 
pointing to Judge Nathan to whatever 
the article(s) in which she has made comments about Epstein that are far more limited than what she will say in

2. On the sealing letter — I think we should add a sentence explaining why we think the claim of Maxwell abuse will 
cause prejudicial publicity. Namely, to air that issue in a public filing when there may well be no good faith basis for 
it would potentially taint the jury pool.

Dear Judge Nathan: 
The Government respectfully submits its motions in limine, which the Government is 
submitting to the Court under seal by email with proposed redactions. The Government's proposed 
redactions are consistent with the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. 
Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Although the Government's motions in 
limine are judicial documents subject to the common law presumption of access, the proposed 
redactions are narrowly tailored to protect the privacy interests of victims—including victims who 
have not identified themselves on the record in this case and who have not publicly identified 
themselves as victims referenced in the Indictment in this case—and third parties referenced in the 
document. 
In addition, the Government seeks redaction of Section X at least until the conclusion of 
trial. Additional justification for this sealing request is located in footnote 11 on page 49 of the 
Government's motions in limine.

I hope you are well and getting some time "off" this summer. I'm reaching out via email as it may be the most efficient 
way to tee-up the inquiry we have received, but we can circulate a dial-in at a convenient time for you if you'd like to 
discuss anything.

Deutsche Bank has received a third-party subpoena from the Attorney General's Office of the U.S. Virgin Islands in 
connection with a pending civil suit they have filed against Jeffrey Epstein's estate, the executors of the estate, and 
others. One of the requests is for a copy of any government subpoenas received by the Bank relating to Epstein, and a 
copy of any productions made pursuant to the subpoenas. Do we have your permission to disclose your subpoena and 
our production to you to the U.S.V.I. AG? Would you prefer us to refer the office to you directly or provide you with 
contact information? I'm happy to send you a copy of the U.S.V.I. AG subpoena if helpful in evaluating the request. 
Best,

Just confirming receipt. Also, I'm hopeful that we can have everything gathered by April 12th. However, I'll be out of the 
office for the next week so it might be delayed. Will that be a problem? 
In addition, and just for confirmation's sake, you are ok that we will make reasonable efforts to notify the 
parents/students of the subpoena prior to compliance with the subpoena correct? 
Thanks,

I apologize about not getting back with you. I thought the other attorney that filed the response was going to do so. 
Regardless, the response included everything that Interlochen has. They only keep tuition payment information for 7 
years and nothing in their files reflects any payments by Epstein or Epstein entities.

Thank you both very much for your assistance in response to our subpoenas seeking records from Interlochen. In 
reviewing the documents you produced in response to the attached subpoena, a follow-up question arose. Would 
you please confirm that your production included all records of any tuition payments that Epstein (or his entities) 
made for any students at Interlochen? 
Our team is also happy to discuss this inquiry over the phone if that would be useful. I am starting a trial tomorrow 
and will have limited availability this week, but my colleagues

agreement resolving the case is relevant to our ongoing investigation into Maxwell's participation in the abuse of 
and other underage girls.

Without conceding that these materials constitute discoverable materials pursuant to Rule

Attorney's Eyes' Only 
The Government recognizes its obligations under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), 
and its progeny. The Government wishes to bring your attention to the following statements, 
which could constitute Brady material: 
• 
Inmate-4 stated that on the night of August 9, 2019, the corrections officers 
performed "a few rounds that night" but Inmate-4 could not recall what time. 
• 
Inmate-5 stated that Noel came by "around 10 to do the count" on the evening of 
August 9, 2019. 
• 
Inmate-7 stated that on the evening of August 9, 2019, the corrections officers "did 
[a] count around l0ish but not after that." Inmate-7 further stated that Inmate-7 
was not really awake for the 3:00 a.m. count on August 10, 2019, "but hear[d] [the] 
gate open." 
This range excludes SDNY_00007661-SDNY_00007665, which the court has directed the 
Government to withhold.

• 
Inmate-11 stated that on the evening of August 9, 2019 into the morning of August 
10, 2019, the "last check was made sometime between 12:30Am — 1:00AM. The 
male black stayed by the door and the female black walked through the tier but did 
not walk all the way in." 
In addition, materials from Inmate-2 include a statement which could constitute Brady, however, 
the Court has directed the Government to withhold these materials from production due to pending 
ex pante litigation. The Government will produce these materials if and when the Court orders 
their production. Beyond the above materials, to date, the Government is unaware of any other 
Brady material regarding your client, but will provide timely disclosure if any such material comes 
to light. The Government will provide material under Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 154 
(1972), and its progeny, to the extent it has not already been produced, in a timely manner prior to 
trial. 
II. 
Materials Not Disclosed 
In addition to the materials identified above, the Government is in possession of additional 
records that are not discovery materials under Rule 16(a). Nonetheless, in an abundance of caution, 
the Government is providing the following inventory of those materials that have not been 
produced: 
• 
Financial records .roduced b Bank of America for accounts in the names of 
• 
Financial records produced by Citibank for accounts in the names of 
•

If at any time you believe that any of the foregoing materials should be produced as Rule 
16(a) materials, please promptly notify the Government.

III. 
Disclosure by the Defendant 
In light of your request for the foregoing discovery, the Government hereby requests 
reciprocal discovery under Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(b). Specifically, we request that you allow 
inspection and copying of: (1) any books, or copies or portions thereof, which are in the 
defendant's possession, custody or control, and which the defendant intends to introduce as 
evidence or otherwise rely on at trial; and (2) any results or reports of physical or mental 
examinations and of scientific tests or experiments made in connection with this case, or copies 
thereof, which are in the defendant's possession or control, and which the defendant intends to 
introduce as evidence or otherwise rely on at trial or which were prepared by a witness whom the 
defendant intends to call at trial. 
The Government also requests that the defendant disclose prior statements of witnesses he 
will call to testify. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 26.2; United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225 (1975). We 
request that such material be provided on the same basis upon which we agree to supply the 
defendant with 3500 material relating to Government witnesses. 
We also wish to remind you that Fed. R. Crim. P. 12.3(a) requires you to provide the 
Government with written notice if the defendant intends to claim a defense of actual or believed 
exercise of public authority on behalf of a law enforcement or Federal intelligence agency at the 
time of the alleged crime. 
The Government requests a response to our Rule 12.3 demand within the time period 
allowed by the Court for the filing of motions. 
IV. 
Sentence Reduction for Acceptance of Responsibility 
Please contact us at your earliest convenience concerning the possible disposition of this 
matter or any further discovery which you may request. This Office will oppose the additional 
one-point reduction under the Sentencing Guidelines available for defendants who plead prior to 
the Government's initiation of trial preparations pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(b), in the event your 
client has not entered a plea of guilty four weeks prior to trial. We will follow this policy whether 
or not suppression or other pretrial motions remain outstanding after this date and even if the trial 
date has not been announced by the Court four weeks in advance of the trial.

--- PAGE 7 ---
Page 7 
Please be advised, however, that pursuant to the policy of the Office concerning plea offers, 
no plea offer is effective unless and until made in writing and signed by authorized representatives 
of the Office. In particular, discussions regarding the pretrial disposition of a matter that are not 
reduced to writing and signed by authorized representatives of the Office cannot and do not 
constitute a "formal offer" or a "plea offer," as those terms are used in Lafier v. Cooper, 132 S.Ct. 
1376 (2012); Missouri v. Frye, 132 S.Ct. 1399 (2012).

If either or both of the other individuals want to reach out to us, that's totally fine and they can call 
in the first 
instance -- her cell is 
and they can call her literally anytime (and can leave a message with their contact info 
if for whatever reason she's not able to pick up when they call). 
Separately, we're confirmed for Thursday at 4:30. One heads up, as I mentioned was a possibility, the AUSAs will be me 
and my colleague 
is also traveling, so 
is available, but please let us know if you think it would be 
prudent (and/or if 
prefers) that we have another female agent join, in case there are topics 
would prefer 
that 
and I step out for. No pressure or obligation either way, just wanted to mention it as a possibility. 
Please let me know if I'm forgetting anything, and thanks very much.

affirmatively reach out to you or one of your colleagues to arrange a meeting with you. 
I wasn't sure if I should give her

I just tried to reach you at your desk, but missed you. 
is available to meet this week at 4:30 at our office if that works for you. Also, she plans to make the phone calls we 
discussed today and tomorrow on her own. She will contact me once she has connected with two individuals she's 
reaching out to and I will reach out to you in turn. 
Happy to discuss anything, if that's helpful. 
Thanks,

Subject: RE: SDNY investigation / interview 
Alex, 
Just tried calling but missed you — wanted to briefly follow up on our conversation last week to let you know that we 
certainly don't have any objection to someone from your firm (whether attorney or staff) taking notes in connection with 
Ms. 
conversations to tell the individuals we discussed that our office is interested in speaking with them. I 
expect we might request a copy of the notes, and, as discussed, whoever is with her would be a potential, theoretical 
witness, but no issue on our end with any of that. 
Separately, if it's possible, could you please ask Ms. 
if there is a time next week or the following that we could 
meet with her? We're hoping to cover all the information we need to in this first set of discussions before June, when I 
think it will be even more inconvenient for her to meet. I expect the next meeting will address difficult topics, including 
Giglio subjects and some review of Epstein's conduct with Ms. 
in particular; but, I also expect that once we get 
through those issues, we won't need to meet with her again for at least a little while. 
We can generally make ourselves available whenever works on her end, with some combination of our team (e.g., if it's 
the latter half of next week, will likely be me and our new team member 
but let us know if there are any issues 
with that), and as always can work around her schedule. And happy to come to your office for the final push. 
Don't hesitate to give a call if any other info would be helpful, or if any questions or issues, and thanks very much.

DATE FILED: 1 On 5/21 
Re: 
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
The Government respectfully submits this letter in response to the Court's Order dated 
October 15, 2021 (Dkt. No. 348) ordering the Government to respond to the defendant's October 
14, 2021 letter regarding delivery of the defendant's legal mail at the Metropolitan Detention 
Center ("MDC") (Dkt. No. 346). 
The Government conferred with legal counsel at the MDC in response to the Court's Order 
and was informed of the following: As a general matter, legal mail from a defendant's counsel is 
delivered to the defendant within one business day of receipt at the MDC. Legal mail sent to a 
defendant from the Government via FedEx goes to the MDC's warehouse. Staff at the MDC's 
warehouse process and log the mail in a tracking system and then contact the relevant 
department—in this case, the legal department—about the mail. The legal department has to then 
go to the warehouse to retrieve the mail, log the mail, assign the mail an internal number for 
tracking purposes, and fill out a form authorizing the delivery of the mail to the inmate before 
delivering the mail to the inmate. 
Legal counsel at the MDC has explained to the Government that these are the MDC's 
EFTA00027753
--- PAGE 2 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 350 Filed 10/15/21 Page 2 of 3 
Page 2 
standard procedures for legal mail, and these protocols apply to each one of the approximately 
1,700 inmates at the MDC. Legal counsel at the MDC has further explained that defense counsel's 
request that the MDC be ordered to provide the defendant with all legal mail within one day of 
receipt by the MDC would be extremely burdensome and is not practicable in light of the various 
responsibilities of the MDC's legal department, which is responsible for issues relating to the 
approximately 1,700 inmates at the MDC. The Government respectfully submits that there are no 
circumstances that merit special expedited delivery for this defendant, and that the delivery of the 
defendant's mail should not receive priority over the services the legal department's staff provides 
to other inmates. 
As noted in the defense's letter, the Government sent a hard drive containing Court-ordered 
disclosures to the defendant via FedEx on October 11, 2021. The hard drive was received by the 
MDC on October 12, 2021. Legal counsel at the MDC informed the Government that there was 
an institutional emergency impacting the safety and security of the MDC on October 13, 2021, 
such that no inmate at the MDC received any legal mail from the warehouse that day. On the 
morning of October 14, 2021, legal counsel at the MDC personally delivered the hard drive to the 
defendant. 
The Government has made best efforts to obtain accurate information and respond to the 
Court's Order within a short time frame. Should the Court have any questions or require any 
additional details regarding this topic, the Government will confer with legal counsel at the MDC 
and provide additional information.

Based on the information in this letter, the Court will not enter the Defendant's requested order. 
See Dkt. No. 346. However, it is the Court's firm expectation that a defendant in a pre-trial 
posture like Ms. Maxwell will in most circumstances receive legal mail within approximately 
business day. Going forward, if another delay occurs, the Defendant may renew the request 
for a specific order requiring delivery within that time frame. With this understanding and in 
light of the unusually early pre-trial disclosure schedule set by the Court, the Court remains 
confident that Ms. Maxwell and her attorneys are fully able to prepare for trial. This resolves 
Dkt. No. 346. SO ORDERED.

Just a quick question regarding the cancelled trip for this Thursday (5/30/19). Was this trip booked through CWT by phone 
or online? If either scenario, I'll need the cancelled record locator to see if it's refundable, and ask them to send me a 
document stating it was refunded to your government travel card. Thanks.

Hi 
I have a trip scheduled for this week that just got final approval late Friday night, so I made reservations on E2 this 
weekend and wanted to let you know in case you need to do things for authorization and/or if you want to consolidate 
the reservations (unfortunately I couldn't figure out how to do everything together so ended up with three different 
reservations—I'm sorry about that!). 
Because I had a previously-scheduled trip to San Francisco on this Thursday, • approved my second leg flight to go 
straight there (rather than coming back to NYC). The reservations I made are: 
Tuesday, May 28, flight from LGA to PBI 
- 
JetBlue, departing 1:27 p.m. (arriving 4:25 p.m.) 
Tuesday, May 28, hotel in West Palm Beach 
- 
Hilton West Palm Beach, from May 28 to May 30 
Thursday, May 30, flight from PBI to SFO (with layover in ATL) 
- 
Delta, departing 5:30 a.m. (arriving ATL at 7:12 a.m., departing ATL at 8:10 a.m.) arriving SFO at 10:22 a.m. 
If these need to be canceled and re-booked as one itinerary, that's totally fine, I just didn't want to wait until the day 
before to at least make the reservations. 
Last question is, I had to cancel my New York to San Francisco flight previously scheduled for Thursday morning (because 
there were no flights late enough to be after our final interviews in Florida on Wednesday, or early enough to get me back 
to New York on Thursday) which incurred a $100 cancellation fee. Is it possible to be reimbursed for that? 
Please let me know if any questions at all, apologies again for any inconvenience, and thanks as always.

To clarify, the cancelled trip was a long-scheduled personal trip. Because of the work travel scheduled for this week, I had 
to cancel my outbound personal travel flight, and I was charged $100 for that cancellation (which I paid for personally). 
I'm just wondering if that's reimbursable because I wouldn't have been charged that fee if it wasn't for the work trip I now 
am going on this week.

Alex, 
Subject: RE: SDNY investigation / interview 
Just tried calling but missed you — wanted to briefly follow up on our conversation last week to let you know that 
we certainly don't have an ob'ection to someone from your firm (whether attorney or staff) taking notes in 
connection with Ms. 
conversations to tell the individuals we discussed that our office is interested in 
speaking with them. I expect we might request a copy of the notes, and, as discussed, whoever is with her would 
be a potential, theoretical witness, but no issue on our end with any of that. 
Separately, if it's possible, could you please ask Ms. 
if there is a time next week or the following that 
we could meet with her? We're hoping to cover all the information we need to in this first set of discussions 
before June, when I think it will be even more inconvenient for her to meet. I expect the next meethir, 
address difficult topics, including Giglio subjects and some review of Epstein's conduct with Ms. 
in 
particular; but, I also expect that once we get through those issues, we won't need to meet with her again for at 
least a little while. 
We can generally make ourselves available whenever works on her end, with some combination of our team 
(e.g., if it's the latter half of next week, will likely be me and our new team member 
, but let us know if 
there are any issues with that), and as always can work around her schedule. And happy to come to your office 
for the final push. 
Don't hesitate to give a call if any other info would be helpful, or if any questions or issues, and thanks very 
much.

I just spoke to Stan again — unfortunately it continues to be a game of telephone (literally and figuratively), but he says 
apparently=has been at the beach which is why we (and they) haven't been able to reach her. He says to keep trying 
her, that she has no problem talking with us it's just an issue of logistics and getting in touch. He also confirmed we have 
her correct number. 
He also provided a number for 
who they've spoken to and who is apparently willing to speak with us. If 
we could schedule her for this coming Wednesday (or Tuesday or Thursday) as well, that would be fantastic. She's 
apparently expecting our call, and her number is: 
with apologies for asking this while you're off duty, could you please try them today, and over the weekend if you 
don't connect with them immediately? 
And separately, wanted to follow up on 
— it was just last week we got the green light to call her, but wanted to 
refresh that. The original email with her background info is attached, but her number is

to call (in terms of keeping it confidential) and if we schedule her for the first or second week of June that would be great.

Subject: Epstein Victims Demand Apology From Prosecutors - Law360 
Date: Tue, 28 May 2019 11:02:43 +0000 
Importance: Normal 
Law360 (May 24, 2019, 7:55 PM EDT) -- Two of billionaire sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's victims have asked a 
Florida federal court to nullify the nonprosecution agreement with Epstein that the court has already deemed 
illegal and want an apology from the U.S. attorney's office as well as a hearing at which they and other victims 
can testify. 
The two victims submitted their list of proposed remedies late Thursday after the court found in their favor in 
February and ruled that prosecutors, including then-U.S. Attorney and current Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta, 
violated the Crime Victims' Rights Act when they signed the nonprosecution agreement with Epstein without 
notifying his victims. 
Among the remedies they seek are the nullification of the nonprosecution agreement and the reopening of the 
criminal case against Epstein and a hearing at which they and other victims can address the court in the presence 
of Acosta and Epstein. 
The victims are also asking for a letter of apology from prosecutors as well as a detailed explanation, including 
documents and correspondence, as to why they did not prosecute Epstein's alleged crimes. 
They want employees of the U.S. attorney's office to attend a training course on the CVRA and said the office 
should pay a monetary sanction, as well as the two victims' attorney fees and costs. 
"Here the government has it entirely within its power to provide all the various remedies being sought through 
the lawsuit — and then some," the victims said. "Hopefully the government will simply agree to the remedies 
described above — thereby avoiding any need for the court to make a determination as to how to proceed." 
The filing comes after U.S. District Judge Kenneth A. Marra granted summary judgment to the two victims, 
listed as Jane Does, who sued the government in 2008 alleging that prosecutors had violated the CVRA with the 
Epstein deal. The judge said the government's decision to hide its intentions and to tell victims to just be patient 
with the investigation was "particularly problematic." 
Judge Marra rejected the government's claim that the CVRA requires victims to be notified only of a plea bargain 
or a deferred prosecution agreement, both of which are more common than a nonprosecution agreement. That 
reading of the law is "inconsistent with the goal of the CVRA," according to the judge. 
"The expansive context of the CVRA lends itself to only one interpretation; namely, that victims should be 
notified of significant events resulting in resolution of their case without a trial," Judge Marra said. 
The CVRA grants crime victims a number of rights, including the right to be informed of public court 
proceedings and not to be excluded from those proceedings. The Miami Herald, in an investigative report 
published late last year, printed emails showing the alleged victims were deliberately excluded from the deal cut 
between Acosta, who was then the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida, and Epstein's defense team. 
Epstein's alleged victims — numbering in the dozens — claim he lured teenage girls to his Palm Beach, Florida, 
mansion to engage in sexual acts. They have not had the opportunity to testify in court in any proceeding thus 
far, according to the Herald report. 
EFTA00027770

Epstein pled guilty in 2008 to state charges involving solicitation of prostitution and procurement of minors for 
prostitution. He spent 13 months in prison and is registered as a sex offender. 
Representatives for the parties could not immediately be reached for comment Friday. 
The victims are represented by Bradley Edwards of Edwards Pottinger LLC, Jay C. Howell of Jay Howell & 
Associates PA, John Scarola of Searcy Denney Scarola Barnhart & Shipley PA, and Paul G. Cassell of the 
University of Utah's S.J. Quinney College of Law. 
The government is represented by Ann Marie C. Villafana and Dexter Lee of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the 
Southern District of Florida. 
The case is Doe v. U.S., case number 9:08-cv-80736, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of 
Florida.

Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 452 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/10/2019 Page 1 of 22 
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA 
Case No. 9:08-ev-80736-ICAM 
JANE DOE 1 AND JANE DOE 2, 
Petitioners, 
v. 
UNITED STATES, 
Respondent. 
JANE DOE 1 AND JANE DOE 2'S POSITION ON THE PROCEDURES TO BE 
FOLLOWED TO DETERMINE A REMEDY FOR THE GOVERNMENT'S 
VIOLATION OF THE CRIME VICTIMS' RIGHTS ACT 
Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2 (also referred to as "the victims"), by and through 
undersigned counsel, now file their position regarding the procedures to be followed to 
determine a remedy for the Government's violation of the Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA). 
For the reasons explained below, the Court should direct the Government to begin the process by 
first publicly announcing what remedy (if any) it proposes as appropriate given this Court's 
finding that the rights of Jane Doe 1 and 2 were violated. Thereafter, Jane Doe 1 and 2 will file a 
response, including (if necessary) proposing further remedies. Further cross-briefing could 
follow, assuring all parties (including intervenor Jeffrey Epstein) a chance to place their views 
before the Court. This approach would place the Court in a position to rule expeditiously. While 
the Government opposes having to disclose its proposed remedies first, this approach of 
requiring the Government to initiate remedial action for the violation of the Jane Doe 1 and 2's 
EFTA00027776
--- PAGE 2 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 452 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/10/2019 Page 2 of 22 
rights is consistent with the CVRA's language and goals. It is also the best way to bring this 
decade-old litigation to a prompt conclusion. 
RELEVANT BACKGROUND 
As the Court is aware, Jane Doe 1 and 2 filed this action in 2008, alleging a violation of 
their rights. The focus of concern in this case has recently shifted from whether the Government 
violated Jane Doe 1 and 2's CVRA rights to how to remedy that now-proven violation. As the 
Court is aware, this case has spanned more than a decade, during which the Government 
repeatedly created obstacles to reaching the merits of whether CVRA violations occurred when 
the Government (and Epstein) purposely concealed the consummation and execution of a secret 
non-prosecution agreement (NPA). On February 21, 2019, this Court brought the initial phase of 
the case to an end, holding that Jane Doe 1 and 2's "right to conferral under the CVRA was 
violated." Jane Does I and 2 v. U.S., 350 F.Supp.3d 1201, 1222 (S.D. Fla. 2019). As the Court 
explained, the undisputed evidence establishes that "the Government entered into a[n] NPA with 
Epstein without conferring with Petitioners [i.e., Jane Doe 1 and 2] during its negotiation and 
signing." Id. at 1218. 
At the end of the Court's opinion, the Court directed counsel for Jane Doe 1 and 2 and 
the Government to "confer and inform the Court within 15 days of the date of entry of this Order 
how they wish to proceed on determining the issue of what remedy, if any, should be applied in 
view of the violation." Id. at 1222. The next day, Friday, February 22, 2019, the Court clarified 
that it "did not expect the parties to agree on a remedy. The Court only directs the parties to 
confer on what submissions or proceedings they believe are necessary in order for the Court to 
EFTA00027777
--- PAGE 3 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 452 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/10/2019 Page 3 of 22 
make a determination on a remedy, if any. If the parties are unable to agree on the submissions 
or proceedings necessary, they may submit separate filings." DE 437 at 1. 
Consistent with the Court's direction for a submission within 15 days on proposed 
procedures for a remedy determination, the next workday — Monday, February 25, 2019 — 
Counsel for Jane Does 1 and 2 sent a letter to the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of 
Florida. See Ex. 1. The letter explained their position that the Government should take the next 
step in abiding by its obligations under the CVRA. Jane Doe 1 and 2 noted that, under the 
CVRA, all "[o]fficers and employees of the Department of Justice . . . shall make their best 
efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and accorded, the rights described in [the 
CVRA]." Ex. 1. at 3 (citing 18 U.S.C. § 3771(c)(1) (emphases added)). Under this statutory 
command, Jane Doe 1 and 2 suggested that the Government has an obligation to reasonably 
confer with them. Id. Jane Doe 1 and 2 explained one possible approach to resolving the case 
and their willingness to discuss others. Ex. 1 at 4. 
The Government, however, did not respond to the letter. Accordingly, with the Court's 
March 8 deadline drawing near, on March 4, 2019, Jane Doe 1 and 2 sent a second letter to the 
U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida. Noting their earlier request, Jane Doe 1 and 2 
wrote "again and with increased urgency" to request that the Office "immediately work with us" 
to resolve the case. Ex. 2 at 1. Jane Doe 1 and 2 requested a right to quickly confer, noting that 
time was "of the essence" in view of the Court's March 8 deadline. Id. at 2. 
Once again, the U.S. Attorney's Office did not respond to this request to confer. Instead, 
on the evening of March 4, 2019, counsel received an email from the Government indicating that 
"the Southern District of Florida has been recused from the CVRA litigation." The email did not 
EFTA00027778
--- PAGE 4 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 452 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/10/2019 Page 4 of 22 
explain why, after more than ten years of litigation, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern 
District of Florida was now being recused in the matter. Nor did the email explain why the 
matter was now being sent to Georgia for review. Indeed, reassignment of the matter to Georgia 
seems quite curious, given that some seven years earlier, the Government had informed this 
Court that it had "reassigned responsibility for the investigation and potential prosecution of such 
criminal matters [involving Epstein's sexual activities with minor females] in the Southern 
District of Florida to the United States Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Florida for 
consideration of any prosecutorial action that may be authorized and appropriate." DE 205-2 at 
9. 
On March 6, 2019, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia 
contacted Jane Doe I and 2's counsel, requesting a 90-day extension of time in which to confer 
and propose procedural steps for determining an appropriate remedy. Through counsel, Jane 
Doe I and 2 conferred with the Office, noting that this case has been in litigation for more than a 
decade — requesting that a resolution be expedited. That same day, the Government filed with 
this Court a motion for a 90-day extension of time, arguing that it needed time to learn about the 
case and to confer with Jane Doe I and 2's counsel about how to determine procedures for 
developing a remedy. The Court then asked that counsel for Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2 to 
provide their views on how best to proceed. Their counsel suggested that, as a matter of 
professional courtesy to the new attorneys, the Court should grant the Government's motion but 
limit the extension to 45 days (until no later than April 22, 2019) and that the Government should 
announce what remedy it was voluntarily willing to provide to them on or before May 10, 2019. 
DE 447 at 1-2. 
EFTA00027779
--- PAGE 5 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 452 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/10/2019 Page 5 of 22 
On March 13, 2019, this Court entered an order extending until May 10, 2019, the time 
for the parties to confer on the appropriate mechanism to propose to the Court to make a 
determination regarding an appropriate remedy. DE 448. Thereafter, counsel for Jane Doe 1 and 
and the Government have conferred several times via telephone and additional correspondence 
regarding appropriate procedures to be followed in this case. As stated in their February 25 and 
March 4 letters described above, Jane Doe 1 and 2 contended that the Government should take 
the first step to remedy the CVRA violation, consistent with its "best efforts" obligations under 
the CVRA. Jane Does 1 and 2 expressed their willingness to confer with the Government 
immediately, as they are the petitioners whose rights have already determined to have been 
violated. The Government, however, took the position that it was not yet prepared to engage in 
any substantive discussion. The Government has also insisted that Jane Doe 1 and 2 file an 
additional pleading listing their proposed remedies first with the Court. 
In addition, the Government took the position that substantive proceedings in this case 
should be delayed for several months to permit it to confer with some unspecified number of 
victims — beyond Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2 — about how to resolve the petition filed by Jane 
Doe 1 and 2. This is a dramatic change in position by the Government, now represented by the 
U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia. As the Court will recall, in 2015 
two additional victims — Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 — sought to join this case. DE 280. The 
Government, then represented by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida, 
"vehemently" opposed joinder. See DE 324 at 2 (citing DE 290, 314). The Court adopted the 
Government's position and denied the additional victims' motion to join. DE 324 at 9 (quoting 
De 280 at I). Today, some four years later, the Government now apparently wishes to confer 
EFTA00027780
--- PAGE 6 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 452 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/10/2019 Page 6 of 22 
with (among others) the two victims whom it successfully blocked from joining this case 
previously. 
What specifically the Government wishes to confer about — and what it will tell the 
victims, especially those who are not formally parties to the case and presumably have not kept 
up on the intricacies of the case -- remains unclear. So far as we can determine, during the 
nearly three months since this Court's summary judgment ruling, the Government has not 
initiated any contact with any victims or their counsel. In fact, during an April 29, 2019, 
conference call between attorneys from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of 
Georgia and counsel for Jane Does 1 and 2 (and 3 and 4), the Jane Does' counsel offered to 
simply have the conferral with the Government at that time on that call. The Government 
declined to do so. And the Government was unable to describe the nature of any conference they 
intended to conduct, did not indicate what options they would propose to victims, and did not say 
what message they intended to convey to the victims about what support the Government would 
offer before apparently asking these individuals what remedy they would like to seek. The 
Government could not even define the scope of the victim population from whom the 
Government intended to seek input. 
DISCUSSION 
To be clear, Jane Doe I and 2 have never opposed the Government discussing the case 
with anyone. Nor are they opposed to discussing a settlement of their petition. But at this point, 
the Government has not substantively begun any such process, with the two Jane Does or anyone 
else. The Government has had enough time to talk with whomever will help make up its mind 
on its position and the case simply needs to move forward. The Government procrastination in 
EFTA00027781

Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 452 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/10/2019 Page 7 of 22 
conferring should have no impact on its legal position regarding the appropriate remedy for 
violating the CVRA. It is certainly not a condition precedent to the Government's ability to have 
a position and at the current stage would not only cause delay but could create more issues with 
concluding this case depending on the substance of the one-sided conferral they now seek. 
Accordingly, Jane Doe 1 and 2 now offer their recommendations to the Court as to how 
to proceed to resolve their petition. In setting up a mechanism for determining the appropriate 
remedy in this case, two principles should be paramount. First, because the Government has a 
statutory obligation to see that Jane Doe 1 and 2 "are . . . accorded" their CVRA rights, see 18 
U.S.C. § 3771(c)(1), it should initiate the process for remedying the established CVRA violation 
these two victims suffered. And second, that remedial process should be expedited given the 
extended length of time that the Government's numerous motions have taken to resolve and the 
Government's obligations to ensure that proceedings are "free from unreasonable delay." In 
light of both of these principles, the Court should now direct the Government to move forward 
with announcing the procedure it intends to follow to correct the CVRA violations suffered by 
the two petitioners. That announcement should be followed by subsequent expedited briefing as 
provided below. 
I. 
THE COURT SHOULD DIRECT THE GOVERNMENT TO FIRST ANNOUNCE 
WHAT REMEDIES IT IS WILLING TO PROVIDE TO JANE DOE 1 AND 2 FOR 
THE VIOLATION OF THEIR CVRA RIGHTS. 
While counsel for Jane Doe I and 2 and the Government have conferred on how to craft 
an agreed procedure to propose to the Court for determining a remedy in this case, those efforts 
foundered as to how to proceed at the opening step. Jane Doe 1 and 2 took the view that the 
Government should take the first step by announcing its proposed remedy for the CVRA 
EFTA00027782
--- PAGE 8 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 452 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/10/2019 Page 8 of 22 
violation of their rights. On the other hand, the Government has insisted that Jane Doe 1 and 2 
propose a complete solution for the Government's illegal conduct even though the two victims 
do not know what steps the Government is willing to undertake. 
The Government should go first. Under the CVRA's plain language, the Government 
must remedy the violation of the CVRA — a statutory obligation that the Government cannot 
defer pending some action by unspecified victims, including dozens of women who are not 
parties to this case. 
Under 18 U.S.C. § 3771(c)(1), the Government has a "best efforts" 
obligation to afford victims their rights, including doing so without "unreasonable delay," 18 
U.S.C. § 3771(a)(7). Even if Jane Doe 1 and 2 never submitted anything to the Government (or 
to the Court), the Government would have to undertake its own corrective efforts to protect their 
rights to confer. Under the CVRA, the Government is obligated to take remedial measures now, 
independently of whatever procedure this Court may decide to put in place for determining a 
remedy in this litigation. 
Nor does any confusion exist about what possible steps the Government could take. The 
Court will recall extensive litigation that occurred in this case on the issue of remedies some 
seven years ago. On November 7, 2011, the Government filed its motion to dismiss this action, 
arguing that it was impossible for Jane Doe 1 and 2 to obtain any remedy. DE 205-2 at 3-4. In 
response to the Government's motion to dismiss, Jane Doe 1 and 2 responded that the CVRA in 
fact permits multiple remedies. DE 127 at 8-13. Indeed, Jane Doe 1 and 2 also provided a list 
EFTA00027783
--- PAGE 9 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 452 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/10/2019 Page 9 of 22 
of approximately 27 separate remedies that the Government could provide in addition to re-
opening the non-prosecution agreement. See ki. at 13-18.' 
After the Government replied (DE 205-6), this Court rejected the Government's position 
that no remedy was possible and agreed with Jane Doe 1 and 2. In discussing one possible 
remedy, this Court specifically held that "the CVRA is properly interpreted to authorize the 
rescission or 're-opening' of a prosecutorial agreement—including a non-prosecution 
arrangement—reached in violation of a prosecutor's conferral obligations under the statute. . . . 
[T]he [CVRA] is properly interpreted impliedly to authorize a 're-opening' or setting aside of 
pre-charge prosecutorial agreements made in derogation of the government's CVRA conferral 
obligations . . . ." Jane Does 1 and 2 v. United States, 950 F. Supp. 2d 1262, 1267 (S.D. Fla. 
2013). 
In light of this earlier and extensive briefing, the legal framework for permissible 
remedies is already well developed. It makes no sense to delay this case further, given that 
Jane Doe 1 and 2 provided a list of more than 20 specific remedies back in 2011, DE 127 at 8-18, 
and on February 25, 2019 (four days after this Court's ruling) a follow up letter outlining a way 
to resolve the case. By all reasonable appearances, the Government's request for Jane Doe 1 and 
to provide some further enumeration of what remedies are being sought is a pointless effort at 
delay. So that the record is clear on what remedies are being requested, Jane Doe 1 and 2 simply 
reaffirm that they are seeking each and every remedy listed in 2011 — and are waiting (as they 
Jane Doe 1 and 2 also filed a short, sealed pleading with additional remedies that are 
appropriate in this case. 
EFTA00027784
--- PAGE 10 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 452 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/10/2019 Page 10 of 22 
have since 2011) to see whether the Government will agree to some or all of them — or make 
alternative proposals. 
Directing the Government to go first is also consistent with judicial efficiency. In light 
of the Court's binding ruling that the Government has violated its CVRA obligations, the 
Government may decide to announce that it will voluntarily take the steps that are satisfactory to 
Jane Doe 1 and 2. If so, this litigation might be brought to a swift conclusion without the need 
for any further judicial rulings. And even if the Government's remedies are less-than-complete, 
the existence of those voluntarily provided remedies may limit the scope of the dispute between 
the parties2 — and, accordingly, the scope of any hearings and rulings by this Court. 
Finally, this case is unlike many cases that the Court has before it. In some cases, the 
defendant in an action might be uncertain as to what sorts of remedies are being requested. But 
here the issue of permissible remedies was litigated more than seven years ago. The Government 
took the position that no remedies were possible in this case — and this Court rejected that 
position. This case is an enforcement action, designed to enforce Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2's 
rights under the CVRA. One of the parties — the Government — has it entirely within its power to 
provide all the various remedies being sought through the lawsuit — and then some. Indeed, as 
explained above, the Government is statutorily obligated to use its "best efforts" to provide 
appropriate remedies, 18 U.S.C. § 3771(c)(1), even without any action by this Court. The 
The Court has previously granted Epstein's motion to intervene on remedy issues that 
might affect him. If any remedy is being proposed that affects Epstein, Jane Doe 1 and 2 have 
no objection to him being heard and, indeed, have built in an opportunity for him to be heard in 
the schedule that they propose. 
EFTA00027785
--- PAGE 11 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 452 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/10/2019 Page 11 of 22 
Government should first explain what its "best efforts" will be. Until it does so, there is no 
reason to confer with Jane Doe 1 or Jane Doe 2 — or anyone else for that matter. What specific 
remedy or remedies would the conference be about and what options is the Government making 
available? After more than ten years of litigation, the Government's suggestion that it should 
postpone explaining its proposed remedy is a transparent effort to do nothing but cause further 
delay. 
II. 
THE COURT SHOULD ESTABLISH PROCEDURES THAT WILL EXPEDITE 
PROVIDING A REMEDY TO JANE DOE 1 AND 2. 
The other point that the Court should consider in crafting remedial procedures is the 
extraordinary amount of time that the Government has already managed to delay a resolution of 
the petition filed by Jane Doe 1 and 2. As the Court is aware, Jane Doe 1 (and then Jane Doe 2) 
filed this action in July 2008, and the Government has since raised a seemingly non-stop series 
of objections. And not to be outdone, Epstein also intervened and succeeded in delaying the case 
for a year while he took a meritless interlocutory appeal to the Eleventh Circuit. See Jane Doe I 
and Jane Doe 2 v. U.S., 749 F.3d 999 (11th Cir. 2014). The upshot is that in this case involving 
federal sex offenses against two child victims, a resolution of the petition has been delayed for 
more than a decade. 
The CVRA contemplates rapid resolution of the crime victims' issues. The CVRA's 
enforcement provision provides that "[t]he district court shall take up and decide any motion 
asserting a victim's right forthwith." 18 U.S.C. § 3771(dX3) (emphasis added). The Court of 
Appeals is required to "take up and decide" any mandamus petition for review "within 72 hours 
after the petition has been filed." Id. (emphasis added). To be clear, Jane Doe 1 and 2 have 
EFTA00027786
--- PAGE 12 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 452 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/10/2019 Page 12 of 22 
appreciated the care with which this Court has reviewed this complicated case and believes that 
the Court has satisfied its obligations under the CVRA. But with regard to the Government, the 
Court must view any request for delay by the Government with a wary eye in view of the 
accelerated timelines the CVRA establishes. Indeed, the Government is statutorily obligated to 
protect victims' rights to proceedings free from "unreasonable delay." 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(7). 
Jane Doe 1 and 2 provided the Government with a specific list of possible remedies that 
they were seeking in 2011. The Government has had seven years(!) to review that list — more 
than ample notice of what was going to be requested as the remedies in this case. The Court 
should evaluate any claim that the Government now needs more time to assess the situation 
against that backdrop of years and years of litigation protracted by unfounded Government 
resistance. 
III. 
JANE DOE I AND 2' PROPOSED PROCEDURE FOR THE COURT TO 
DETERMINE A REMEDY. 
In light of the principles discussed above, Jane Doe 1 and 2 propose that the Court order 
the following schedule for determining a remedy in this case, which the Court should enter as 
quickly as is feasible: 
Not later than two weeks from the date of the Court's order: The Government should 
specify in writing how and when it proposes to remedy the violation of the rights of the two 
victims (Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2) who are parties to this litigation. If the Government 
desires, it can also simultaneously but separately specify whether, when, and how it proposes to 
remedy any CVRA violations that denied other victims their rights. 
EFTA00027787
--- PAGE 13 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 452 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/10/2019 Page 13 of 22 
Not more than two weeks later: Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2 should file any objections and 
what (if any) additional remedies they seek from the Court beyond what the Government 
voluntarily proposes to provide. 
Not more than two weeks later: Intervenor Jeffrey Epstein should be permitted to file 
responses to the proposals made by the Government and Jane Doe 1 and 2. 
Not more than two weeks later: The Government responds to Jane Doe 1 and 2 and to 
Epstein. 
Not more than two weeks later: The Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2 reply to the responses 
filed to the proposals. 
Thereafter, the Court would hold oral argument on the issue, and provide an opportunity 
for anyone affected by the issues to address the Court. 
Thereafter, the Court would rule as soon as practicable. 
IV. 
PROMPT MEDIATION 
In addition, Jane Doe 1 and 2 and the Government have discussed the possibility of a 
mediation in this case. Once again, however, the parties have a different point of view as to how 
best to proceed. As Jane Doe 1 and 2 understand the Government's position, it is proposing a 
briefing schedule that could take months before holding a mediation. As the Court will recall, in 
2016 Jane Doe 1 and 2 had joined with the Government in requesting a mediation, which this 
Court ordered. DE 374. However, that mediation effort was unsuccessful but led to a delay. 
Compare DE 374 (March 23, 2016 order directing mediation in the case and delaying 
government response to Jane Doe 1 and 2' summary judgment motion) with DE 403 (June 2, 
2017 response by the Government to Jane Doe 1 and 2's summary judgment motion). 
EFTA00027788
--- PAGE 14 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 452 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/10/2019 Page 14 of 22 
In Jane Doe 1 and 2's view, the mediation went nowhere because of the stage the case 
was in at the time — with the Government taking the position that its handling of the case was 
entirely proper. The posture of the case is much different now — the Court has ruled that Jane 
Doe 1 and 2's rights have been violated and the focus is on providing them a remedy. Jane Doe 
and 2 are willing to have a second mediation at Government expense to discuss resolving the 
case, but they strongly believe that mediation is more likely to be successful if it takes place 
against a backdrop of an on-going schedule leading quickly to a court-imposed solution if the 
mediation fails. Consistent with their wish to rapidly resolve this case, Jane Doe 1 and 2 ask for 
a court-ordered mediation, to be concluded no later than June 3, 2019. The Court should also 
direct the Government to have available at the mediation participant(s) with full settlement 
authority. Because any resolution could impact on the rights of Epstein, Jane Doe 1 and 2 
propose that he should have a full opportunity to participate in the mediation process in a 
separate mom from any victim. 
Consistent with the position outlined here, Jane Doe 1 and 2 attach for the Court's 
consideration a proposed order implementing all these scheduling matters. 
V. 
IF THE COURT GRANTS THE GOVERNMENT'S REQUEST FOR 
ADDITIONAL DELAY, IT SHOULD SIMULTANEOUSLY PERMIT JANE DOE 
AND 2 TO TAKE LIMITED DISCOVERY RELEVANT TO REMEDIAL 
ISSUES. 
For the reasons just explained, Jane Doe 1 and 2 request that the Court should put this 
case on a path toward expeditious resolution as just outlined. The Government will apparently 
propose a different approach, including (as we understand it) months of additional delay for 
meetings with additional (and unspecified) victims (or lawyers) other than Jane Doe 1 and Jane 
EFTA00027789
--- PAGE 15 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 452 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/10/2019 Page 15 of 22 
Doe 2. If the Court decides to approve the Government's approach, Jane Doe 1 and 2 would 
request two additions to the Government's proposal. First, Jane Doe 1 and 2's counsel should be 
permitted to participate in any meetings with other victims. And second, to ensure that any 
additional time required to bring this case to a conclusion is minimized, Jane Doe 1 and 2 should 
be allowed to take six depositions of witnesses with directly relevant information concerning 
remedial issues. 
Turning to the first point, the Government appears to want to meet individually with 
dozens of victims (apart from Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2) over the coming months — even 
though it has not previously met (or, so far we can tell, even communicated) with these persons 
during more than ten years of litigation. The Government misunderstands the current posture of 
this case. As noted above, the Government had previously objected when just two additional 
victims — Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 — tried to join the case. Indeed, the Government was quite 
specific in its position: "[T]his Court should decline to enlarge these proceedings to allow 
additional claims and additional petitioners . . . ." DE 314 at 3-4 (emphasis added). The 
Government went on to argue that Jane Doe 3 and 4 "have provided no satisfactory explanation 
for the delay" in attempting to join the case in 2015. Id. at 8. Indeed, the Government argued 
that adding even two additional victims into the case "would prejudice the Government since it 
would inject new issues into this litigation." Id. at 11. The Government never gave even a hint 
that it was willing to allow Jane Doe 3 and 4 (for example) to be heard at the remedy stage. 
On the particular issue of expanding that case to include two additional victims, the Court 
agreed with the Government's objection. In so ruling, the Court noted that the Government had 
"vehemently" opposed joinder. See DE 324 at 2 (citing DE 290, 314). The Court then explained 
EFTA00027790
--- PAGE 16 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 452 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/10/2019 Page 16 of 22 
that the merits of this case will be decided based on a "determination of whether the Government 
violated the rights of Jane Doe 1, Jane Doe 2, and all `other similarly situated victims' under the 
CVRA. Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 may offer relevant, admissible, and non-cumulative evidence 
that advances that determination, but their participation as listed parties is not necessary in that 
regard." DE 324 at 9 (emphasis deleted) (quoting DE 189 at 1; DE 311 at 2, 12, 15, 18-19). 
In quoting Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2's pleadings about "similarly situated victims," the 
Court was implicitly recognizing the parallels between this case and a class action lawsuit. In 
light of this ruling, Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2 can be viewed as the functional equivalent of 
"class representatives" in a class action lawsuit. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4). And, further 
developing the parallel to a class action lawsuit, Jane Doe 1 and 2's proposed schedule outlined 
above allows for a court hearing, during which any individual member of the victims' class 
would be able to provide their views to the Court as to how best to proceed — subject to a later 
Court ruling — a much more rapid way of obtaining any necessary input than the delay proposed 
by the Government. And Jane Doe 1 and 2 also have made clear that Epstein should have a 
chance to raise any points he believes that the Court should consider — and have built that into 
their proposed schedule. 
If the Court determines to allow the Government to delay the case to have meetings with 
multiple other persons who are not parties to this case, then Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2 — as class 
representatives - should at least be permitted to participate in those meetings through their legal 
counsel. The Government, of course, has been litigating against Jane Doe 1 and 2 for more than 
ten years. Indeed, the Government even threatened at one point to accuse all the victims of being 
criminal participants in their own abuse. See DE 344 at 3-4 (citing Nov. 23, 2015 Tr. at 4-5). It 
EFTA00027791
--- PAGE 17 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 452 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/10/2019 Page 17 of 22 
is Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2 who have been fighting the Government to vindicate their rights as 
Epstein's victims. It makes no sense for the Government to now be able to present its side of this 
case in private meetings with victims without the class representatives being able to participate, 
in order to frame the proceedings in a way that could be designed to prompt a certain 
(presumably pro-Government) view from the other victims. 
In addition, as a second point, if the Court approves the months of delay that the 
Government proposes, the Court should at least make sure that time is used productively to put 
the case in a position for rapid resolution thereafter. The Court can do this by allowing Jane Doe 
and Jane Doe 2 to collect evidence that might be necessary at any contested hearing on remedy. 
In particular, it appears that the Government may attempt to inject into any remedy hearing the 
extent to which Epstein was involved in the CVRA violations. The Government has vaguely 
alluded in its discussions with Jane Doe 1 and 2 to the possibility that if, for example, the NPA 
immunity provisions were rescinded in any way, then Epstein might have the ability to challenge 
certain settlement payments made to some of his victims. Whether Epstein would actually make 
such a challenge and potentially expose himself to far greater civil liability seems highly unlikely 
— and the Government does not appear to have made any effort to even ask him his position. 
(Again, Jane Doe 1 and 2 believe Epstein should be given a full and fair opportunity to provide 
his position on these issues.) But even more important, the Government has not disclosed to 
Jane Doe 1 and 2 the Government's position on any such hypothetical challenge by Epstein — 
much less the evidence within the Government's possession that could be used to respond to that 
challenge. 
EFTA00027792
--- PAGE 18 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 452 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/10/2019 Page 18 of 22 
As Jane Doe 1 and 2 have made clear for years, it is their position that "Epstein has 
'forfeited' any right to seek specific performance of the non-prosecution agreement. . . . [H]e 
was a party to — and, indeed, the instigator of — the Government's CVRA violations. . . . [H]ere 
the illegal agreement was a deliberate plan. In such circumstances, any equitable claim Epstein 
has for specific performance of the non-prosecution agreement disappears." DE 127 at 9 (citing 
U.S. v. Walker, 98 F.3d 944, 947 (7th Cir. 1996) (defendant forfeited right to seek specific 
performance of a plea agreement because the agreement was illegal)). Jane Doe 1 and 2 have 
reiterated that position in discussions with the Government over the past several months. But the 
Government has yet to share with Jane Doe 1 and 2 all of the information it possesses that 
Epstein instigated the illegal decision not to notify them of the agreement — or even if it will join 
Jane Doe 1 and 2's legal position. 
Given the Government's failure to disclose all its information about Epstein's 
involvement in the illegal agreement, Jane Doe 1 and 2 need depositions of key witnesses on this 
subject. This Court has previously ruled that Jane Doe 1 and 2 could undertake "limited 
discovery in the form of document requests and requests for admissions from the U.S. Attorney's 
Office." DE 99 at 11. The Court also stated that "[e]ither party may request additional discovery 
if necessary." Id. 
If the Government will not announce what remedy it is prepared to provide, then 
depositions are necessary. Depositions will shed important light on remedial issues beyond what 
the available documentary evidence currently reveals. One example of a subject for a deposition 
is a "breakfast meeting" that appears to have taken place on around October 12, 2007, between 
U.S. Attorney Acosta and Epstein attorney Jay Lefkowitz. This Court has previously noted that 
EFTA00027793
--- PAGE 19 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 452 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/10/2019 Page 19 of 22 
this meeting occurred. See Jane Does I and 2 v. U.S, 359 F.Supp.3d 1201, 1210 (S.D. Fla. 
2019). And a subsequent letter from Lefkowitz to Acosta briefly refers to "a commitment" by 
the U.S. Attorney at that meeting that his Office "would not . . contact any of the identified 
[victims] . . . in this matter." Id. But what was discussed specifically does not appear to have 
been memorialized. A deposition will answer that and other related questions and will, Jane Doe 
and 2 believe, establish that the Epstein was ultimately responsible for the decision not to 
disclose the existence of the immunity provisions to them. 
With the assistance of the Court, Jane Doe 1 and 2 were able to secure various emails and 
letters between the Government and Epstein's attorneys. But the documents available to Jane 
Doe 1 and 2 do not fully reveal what was agreed to among the lawyers for the United States, 
Palm Beach County, and Epstein. Indeed, it appears that some of the key players decided not to 
put in writing what was happening — as this Court has previously noted. See Jane Does I and 2 
v. U.S., 359 F.Supp.3d 1201, 1207 (S.D. Fla. 2019) ("Palm Beach County State Attorney 
wrote the line prosecutor about the proposed agreement and added: 'Glad we could get 
this worked out for reasons I won't put in writing. After this is resolved I would love to buy you 
a cup at Starbucks and have a conversation.'" (emphasis added)). 
Accordingly, if the Court grants the Government's request for delay, Jane Doe 1 and 2 
request that during the months of delay, they be given leave to depose six witnesses - former 
U.S. Attorney Acosta, who negotiated restrictions on what the victims could be told, during the 
"breakfast meeting" and otherwise; Assistant U.S. Attorney 
who implemented the 
directions she was given by the U.S. Attorney; former Palm Beach County State Attorney Barry 
, who was involved in the plea discussions and was "glad" to work a deal out for reasons 
EFTA00027794
--- PAGE 20 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 452 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/10/2019 Page 20 of 22 
he would not "put in writing"; Epstein Attorney Jay Lefkowitz, who was a key participant in the 
"breakfast meeting" and was deeply involved in crafting the restrictions on what the victims 
were to be told; and FBI Agen 
who were responsible 
for interacting with the U.S. Attorney's Office on the subject of victim notifications and provided 
some of those notifications. 
Jane Doe 1 and 2 can provide further information about why these six witnesses have 
important information connected with the remedies that are available in this case. But the 
Government has already agreed that this Court has this power to allow such discovery. See DE 
at 11 ("the United States agreed that this Court, under its inherent authority to manage this 
case, could impose discovery obligations on each party."). And in its July 20, 2015 initial 
disclosures under Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(1)(A)(1), the Government itself listed all these witnesses 
as persons who possess information relevant to this case. Jane Doe 1 and 2 respectfully submit 
that it would expedite a resolution of this case if they were permitted to take depositions during 
any delay in a resolution proposed by the Government.' 
CONCLUSION 
For all the reasons explained above, the Court should adopt Jane Doe 1 and 2's proposed 
procedures and schedule for reaching a resolution on the appropriate remedy in this case. 
DATED: May 10, 2019 
Based on their current (limited) understanding of the Government's position on 
remedies in this case, Jane Doe 1 and 2 believe that with six depositions, they could collect the 
necessary evidence for a remedial hearing. They reserve the right to seek additional discovery if 
the Government's position on remedy necessitates it.

Re: 
Protecting the Rights of Teffrey Epstein's Victims 
Dear Ms. Orshan: 
We represent several victims of sex abuse and trafficking crimes committed by 
Jeffrey Epstein, including Jane Doe 1, Jane Doe 2, Jane Doe 3, and Jane Doe 4. We write 
to request that you make your best efforts to see that these victims are accorded their 
rights under the Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA), 18 U.S.C. § 3771. In particular, we 
ask you to immediately rescind the provisions in the non-prosecution agreement 
barring prosecution of Epstein and his co-conspirators and reopen the investigation. As 
Judge Marra has clearly ruled, your Office entered into those particular provisions with 
Epstein in 2007 illegally. We ask that you now extend to our clients — and all of 
Epstein's victims — their right to confer about the reasons Epstein and his co-
conspirators should be federally prosecuted by your Office for the crimes he committed 
against them. 
You are no doubt generally familiar with the facts surrounding Epstein's 
numerous federal sex crimes committed within your District, so we will just highlight a 
few salient facts that were all recently found by U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra in his 
detailed opinion and order granting our clients summary judgment and finding that 
your Office had violated the CVRA. Opinion and Order, Jane Does v. United States, No. 
9:08-cv-80736 (Feb. 21, 2019) (hereinafter referred to as "Summary Judgment Order"). 
As Judge Marra explained, between about 1999 and 2007, "Jeffrey Epstein 
sexually abused more than 30 minor girls, including Petitioners Jane Doe 1 and Jane 
Doe 2 ... at his mansion in Palm Beach, Florida, and elsewhere in the United States and

overseas. Because Epstein and his co-conspirators knowingly traveled in interstate and 
international commerce to sexually abuse Jane Doe 1, Jane Doe 2 and others, they 
committed violations of not only Florida law, but also federal law." Id. at 1-2 (internal 
citations omitted). To make a long story short, ultimately in 2007 your Office entered 
into a non-prosecution agreement with Epstein, in which your Office agreed not to 
prosecute him for federal sex abuse crimes committed against Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 
and countless other underage girls whom Epstein and his co-conspirators victimized. 
Id. at 7-10. This non-prosecution agreement was an illegal agreement, as your Office 
entered into it by violating the CVRA: 
Here, it is undisputed that the Government entered into a NPA 
with Epstein without conferring with [Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2] during 
its negotiation and signing. Instead, the Government sent letters to the 
victims requesting their "patience" with the investigation even after the 
Government entered into the NPA. At a bare minimum, the CVRA 
required the Government to inform Petitioners that it intended to enter 
into an agreement not to prosecute Epstein. Although the binding effect of 
the NPA was contingent upon Epstein pleading guilty to the state charges, 
that contingency was out of the control of the Government. The 
Government's hands were permanently tied if Epstein fulfilled his 
obligations under the NPA. Thus, Petitioners and the other victims should 
have been notified of the Government's intention to take that course of 
action before it bound itself under the NPA. Had the Petitioners been 
informed about the Government's intention to forego federal prosecution 
of Epstein in deference to him pleading guilty to state charges, Petitioners 
could have conferred with the attorney for the Government and provided 
input. In re Dean, 527 F.3d 391, 394 (5th Cir. 2008) (there are rights under 
the CVRA including the "reasonable right to confer with the attorney for 
the Government"). Hence, the Government would have been able to 
"ascertain the victims' views on the possible details of the [non-
prosecution agreement]." Id. Indeed, it is this type of communication 
between prosecutors and victims that was intended by the passage of the 
CVRA. See United States v. Heaton, 458 F. Supp. 2d 1271 (D. Utah 
2006)(government motion to dismiss charge of using facility of interstate 
commerce to entice minors to engage in unlawful sexual activity would 
not be granted until government consulted with victim); United States v. 
Ingrassia, No. CR-04-0455ADSJO, 2005 WL 2875220, at *17 n. 11 (E.D.N.Y. 
Sept. 7, 2005) (Senate debate supports the view that the contemplated 
mechanism for victims to obtain information on which to base their input

Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 452-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/10/2019 Page 4 of 6 
was conferral with the prosecutor concerning any critical stage or 
disposition of the case). 
Id. at 26-27. 
Judge Marra also noted that your Office had "concealed" the NPA from the 
victims and "misled" the victims about the possibility of a federal prosecution: 
Particularly problematic was the Government's decision to conceal the 
existence of the NPA and mislead the victims to believe that federal 
prosecution was still a possibility. When the Government gives 
information to victims, it cannot be misleading. While the Government 
spent untold hours negotiating the terms and implications of the NPA 
with Epstein's attorneys, scant information was shared with victims. 
Instead, the victims were told to be "patient" while the investigation 
proceeded. 
Id. at 28. 
In light of these and other illegal actions by your Office, Judge Marra specifically 
held that "under the facts of this case, there was a violation of the victims' rights under 
the CVRA." Id. at 33. He granted Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2's motion for summary 
judgement on the issue of whether your Office violated the CVRA, holding that their 
"right to conferral under the CVRA was violated." Id. 
Because of these clear and specific findings, your Office now has clear and 
specific obligations under the CVRA. In particular, under 18 U.S.C. § 3771(c)(1), all 
"[o]fficers and employees of the Department of Justice ... shall make their best efforts to 
see that crime victims are notified of, and accorded, the rights described in [the 
CVRA]." Your Office must follow this congressional command and "accord" Jane Doe 
and Jane Doe 2 - along with Epstein's numerous other victims - their right to 
reasonably confer with your Office concerning the need for federally prosecuting 
Epstein and his co-conspirators for the numerous sexual trafficking crimes they 
committed in your District. 
Judge Marra has already directly ruled on how your Office must protect 
Epstein's victims' rights. Judge Marra has held that the victims' "rights under the 
CVRA attach before the Government brings formal charges against a defendant." 
Summary Judgment Order at 26 (citing Does v. United States, 817 F. Supp. 2d 1337, 1341 
EFTA00027801
--- PAGE 27 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 452-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/10/2019 Page 5 of 6 
(S.D. Fla. 2011)). Judge Marra has also held that "the CVRA authorizes the rescission or 
"reopening" of a prosecutorial agreement, including a non-prosecution agreement, 
reached in violation of a prosecutor's conferral obligations under the statute." Id. 
(emphasis added) (quoting Does v. United States, 950 F. Supp. at 1267). Judge Marra has 
further held that "section 3771(d)(5) of the CVRA authorizes the setting aside of pre-
charge prosecutorial agreements ...." Id. (citing Does v. United States, 950 F. Supp. 2d at 
1267). And, finally, Judge Marra has further held that "the 'reasonable right to confer .. 
. in the case' extends to the pre-charge state of criminal investigations and proceedings." 
Id. 
In view of these findings - binding on your Office as a party to the litigation —
your Office has a statutory duty to protect the CVRA rights of Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 
through "rescission or reopening" of Epstein's non-prosecution agreement. We 
request that your Office immediately take that step and notify all of Epstein's victims 
that the provisions in the agreement blocking the federal prosecution of Epstein and his 
co-conspirators have been rescinded and that the victims now have a right to confer 
with your Office about federal prosecution of Epstein. You and the other prosecutors in 
your Office have specific and personal obligations under the CVRA to make your "best 
efforts" to accord the victims of their rights. Congress did not limit those obligations in 
any way, and your Office must follow that congressional command. 
In the past, we have met at various times with your predecessor and the capable 
prosecutors handling this matter, trying to resolve these issues without the need for 
further litigation. All those efforts have been for naught, because your Office 
continually asserted the position that it had not violated the victims' CVRA rights. 
Now that Judge Marra has directly rejected your Office's claim, we hope that your 
Office will rapidly do the right thing and give the victims' the conferral and other rights 
to which they are entitled. 
We would be happy to meet with your Office further to discuss how protecting 
victims' rights can be most effectively accomplished. In light of Judge Marra's order 
that we are to confer with your Office regarding issues concerning remedies in this case 
by March 8, the favor of a prompt reply is requested.

Re: 
Protecting the Rights of ieffrey Epstein's Victims 
Dear Ms. Orshan: 
As you know, we represent several victims of federal sex abuse and sex 
trafficking crimes committed by Jeffrey Epstein, including Jane Doe 1, Jane Doe 2, Jane 
Doe 3, and Jane Doe 4. On February 25, 2019, we wrote to request that you make your 
best efforts to see that these victims are accorded their rights under the Crime Victims' 
Rights Act (CVRA), 18 U.S.C. § 3771 — specifically that your Office immediately rescind 
the provisions in the non-prosecution agreement barring prosecution of Epstein and his 
co-conspirators and reopen the investigation. We requested the favor of a prompt 
reply. Judge Marra has directed that we confer to determine whether we can jointly 
fashion a remedy for the violation of the victims' rights and, in any event, what 
submissions and proceedings are needed to reach a final resolution of the remedy issue. 
We have a right to confer under the CVRA. You have not yet responded. 
We write — again and with increased urgency — to request that your Office 
immediately work with us to implement the only efficacious remedy for the victims that 
is available: rescinding the provisions in the non-prosecution agreement barring 
Epstein's prosecution for federal sex crimes by your Office. As we explained in our 
earlier letter, Judge Marra has already ruled that the law permits this remedy. Judge 
Marra has specifically held that "the CVRA authorizes the rescission or "reopening" of a 
prosecutorial agreement, including a non-prosecution agreement, reached in violation of a 
prosecutor's conferral obligations under the statute." Opinion and Order at 26, Jane 
Does v. United States, No. 9:08-cv-80736 (Feb. 21, 2019) (quoting Does v. United States, 950 
F. Supp. at 1267). Judge Marra has further held that "section 3771(d)(5) of the CVRA 
authorizes the setting aside of pre-charge prosecutorial agreements ...." Id. (citing Does

You and the prosecutors in your Office have an obligation to afford our clients 
their congressionally granted right to confer about whether to prosecute Epstein. See 18 
U.S.C. § 3771(c)(1). Through more than a decade of litigation, the U.S. Attorney's Office 
for the Southern District of Florida and sexual assault victims have been litigating 
whether the victims' rights were violated. That issue has been decided. The only issue 
for your Office now is whether it wants to confer with victims about whether federal 
prosecution of serial pedophile and major international sex trafficker is appropriate. 
Congress has directed that prosecutors must confer with victims about important 
prosecutive decisions. The path forward now is simple. We could work together to 
draft a proposed court order that will quickly resolve this long-running litigation, by 
declaring the provisions of the NPA barring Epstein's prosecution to be invalid and that 
your Office will confer about whether to prosecute. We stand ready to discuss details in 
the proposed order, including creating time for Epstein to raise any objections he might 
have with the court. 
If for any reason you are unwilling to agree with what we believe is the obvious 
resolution of this unfortunate split between victims of federal sex crimes and 
prosecutors with power to prosecute those crime, we would —again — like to quickly 
confer about the matter. On behalf of our clients, we have a right to confer under 18 
U.S.C. § 3771(a)(5). 
Time is of the essence. On Friday of this week, we must advise the judge 
whether the victims and the prosecutors are united - or divided. The favor of quick 
response is — again — requested.

JANE DOE 1 AND JANE DOE 2, 
Petitioners, 
v. 
UNITED STATES, 
Respondent. 
ORDER REGARDING SCHEDULING ON REMEDY ISSUES 
This matter is before the Court pursuant to the Court's order directing the parties to 
confer regarding how they propose proceeding on the determining what remedy, if any, should 
be applied in view of the Court's finding that petitioners Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2's right to 
conferral was violated. DE 435 at 33. The parties have conferred, and each have submitted 
proposed procedures for making that remedy determination. 
The Court having carefully reviewed that parties' submissions, it is hereby ORDERED 
AND ADJUGED that: 
Not later than two weeks from the date of the Court's order, the Government shall file a 
statement specifying how and when it proposes to remedy the violation of the rights of the two 
victims (Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2) who are parties to this litigation. If the Government 
desires, it can also simultaneously but separately specify whether, when, and how it proposes to 
remedy any CVRA violations that denied other victims their rights. 
Not more than two weeks later, Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2 shall file any objections and a 
statement of what (if any) additional remedies they seek from the Court beyond what the 
Government voluntarily proposes to provide.

--- PAGE 33 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 452-3 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/10/2019 Page 2 of 2 
Not more than two weeks later, Intervenor Jeffrey Epstein is permitted to file, if he so 
chooses, any response to the proposals made by the Government and Jane Doe 1 and 2. 
Not more than two weeks later, the Government shall respond to Jane Doe 1 and 2 and to 
Epstein. 
Not more than two weeks later, Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2 shall reply to the responses 
filed to the proposals. 
Thereafter, the Court may either rule on the basis of the submitted papers or may hold 
oral argument on the issue at a time it shall direct, at which it will provide an opportunity for 
anyone affected by the issues to address the Court. 
The Court also refers this matter to mediation for purposes of conducting a conference 
with respect to the manner in which violations of the CVRA will be remedied. The mediation 
shall be held no later than June 3, 2019. The mediation shall be held in Palm Beach County, 
Florida, unless otherwise agreed by the parties and shall be conducted by a mediator chosen by 
agreement of the parties. The parties shall have available at the conference participant(s) with 
full settlement authority. Because Intervenor Jeffrey Epstein has intervened on the issue of 
remedy, he shall also participate in the mediation with appropriate legal counsel, who shall 
remain in a separate room from Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2. The Government shall bear the 
costs associated with the settlement conference.

FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA 
JANE DOE 1 AND JANE DOE 2, 
Civil Action No. 
Petitioners, 
v. 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, 
Respondent. 
08-80736-CIV-MARRA 
Government's Notice of Proposed Procedures for the 
Determination of a Remedy 
The United States of America, by Byung J. Pak, United States Attorney for the 
Northern District of Georgia, and 
Special Attorneys for the Southern District of Florida, files this notice outlining 
the Government's proposed schedule for determining the issue of what remedy, 
if any, should be applied based on the Court's Opinion and Order of February 
21, 2019. [Doc. 435]. 
Pursuant to the Court's order, the parties have conferred extensively over the 
past several weeks regarding the steps that may be necessary to aid the Court's 
determination of a remedy. While the parties agree on certain components, 
including cross-briefing and art opportunity for all parties to be heard, we have 
been unable to reach an agreement on a briefing schedule primarily based on 
two substantive disagreements.

Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 451 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/10/2019 Page 2 of 14 
First, the government has requested a sixty-day period to speak directly with 
victims who may be affected by any remedy in this matter prior to submitting its 
recommendation. For the reasons discussed below, Petitioners counsel oppose 
this request. Based on discussions with Petitioners, the government anticipates 
that Petitioners are likely to propose remedies that could impact victims in 
significant—and perhaps unintended —ways. At this time, neither the 
government nor the Petitioners have spoken to the majority of victims. The 
victims views and concerns are critical to inform the government's 
recommendation of an appropriate remedy, particularly given the sensitive 
nature of the crime at issue. Accordingly, the government respectfully submits 
that a sixty-day period to consult with victims is both reasonable and essential to 
the Court's determination of a remedy. 
Second, the government proposes that Petitioners should file the first 
pleading setting forth their recommended remedy; Petitioners insist that the 
government should do so. Requiring Petitioners to file an initial statement is not 
only consistent with the well-established practice that plaintiffs must identify 
their requested relief, but also necessary to the efficient determination of a 
remedy by clarifying the potential scope of options sought by Petitioners. 
Based on its careful review of pleadings in this matter and discussions with 
Petitioners, the government understands Petitioners' long-stated desire for an 
opportunity to be heard and for an efficient resolution of this matter. The 
government shares those concerns. The government also appreciates the delicate

task facing this Court to craft an appropriate remedy that respects the rights of 
all parties without causing unintended harm to victims. Providing the victims 
with an opportunity to be heard, both by having Petitioners submit their 
suggested remedy first and then by granting the government a reasonable time 
to speak with potentially impacted victims, promotes all of these goals and will 
best guide the Court's determination of a path forward. 
DISCUSSION 
Consistent with the principles stated above, the government proposes the 
following procedures to aid the Court's determination of a remedy: 
• Within 30 days of the Court's scheduling order, the Petitioners will 
submit their proposed remedies with a brief in support. 
• The government will have 60 days from the date of the Petitioners' 
submission to consult with the Petitioners and any additional victims 
who may be impacted by the proposed remedies. 
• Within 30 days after this consultation period, the government will 
respond in writing to the Petitioners submission. 
• Within 14 days of the government's submission, the Petitioners may 
submit a reply brief. 
• No stir-replies will be permitted without permission of the Court.

• Within 30 days of the Petitioners' reply, or notice to the Court that no 
reply is being submitted, any briefs by intervening or interested parties 
are due. 
• Within 30 days of the intervening/interested parties submissions, the 
Petitioners and the government may submit a response. 
• The Court will mandate a mediation between the parties to discuss a 
possible resolution of the case.1
• If the mediation is unsuccessful, the Court will hold argument on the 
parties briefs, including any intervening or interested parties 
submissions. 
This schedule will facilitate the expeditious resolution of this matter by 
clarifying the scope of remedies sought by Petitioners in the initial filing, 
granting victims a reasonable time period to share with the government their 
thoughts and concerns about the appropriate outcome, and encouraging the 
parties to mediate a solution. Although the parties share the same aim to find the 
best resolution for victims, Petitioners oppose the government's request for a 60-
day period to speak with victims and do not want to state their requested relief 
first, even though they have had more than ten years to consider what relief to 
seek. The government respectfully submits that the Court should adopt the 
government's proposed schedule. 
The parties agree that a mediation could be productive and are continuing to 
discuss the appropriate timing for one.

1. The Government should have a reasonable period of time to speak with 
victims prior to recommending a remedy that could affect many of them. 
Despite bringing a civil suit based on the government's failure to confer with 
victims prior to entering into a non-prosecution agreement, Petitioners' counsel 
now oppose granting time for the government to confer with those same victims 
in an effort to propose an appropriate remedy for the Court. Counsel's 
opposition is contrary to their prior insistence that the government should speak 
with victims and would hamstring the Court's consideration of issues relevant to 
a proper resolution. In light of the unique procedural posture of this case, the 
voices of victims who may be impacted by any remedy entered in this action will 
shape the government's recommended relief and should guide the Court's 
ultimate resolution. 
Any remedy that the Court imposes in this action may have far-reaching 
consequences that impact many victims beyond Petitioners. In particular, 
Petitioners have repeatedly discussed some form of rescission of the non-
prosecution agreement ("the Agreement") as a remedy in this action. [Doc. 48 at 
37; Doc. 127 at 1]. As the Court is well aware, the Agreement required Jeffrey 
Epstein to fulfill certain conditions in exchange for the non-prosecution 
provisions, including his agreement to compensate victims who chose to file suit 
pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2255, a statute that presumed damages of $150,000 per 
victim with potential recovery of punitive damages and other relief. [Doc. 48 at 
10; Doc. 48-5 at 5]. A rescission of the Agreement may impact victims who

recovered damages pursuant to the Agreement by making their settlements 
subject to challenge. An understanding of the views of these victims is essential 
to the government's, and ultimately this Court's, consideration of this remedy. 
The necessity of consulting with victims who could be affected by any remedy 
is especially apparent here given the particular vulnerability of these victims. It is 
well-recognized that victims of sexual assault may suffer chronic psychological 
effects that carry long-term consequences for their well-being, and 
"[r]eadjustment after victimization can be challenging." Violence Prevention, 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, available at 
httpsilwww.cdc.govIviolencepreventionsexualviolence/fastfact.html (last accessed May 
9, 2019). In this case, even if victim settlements are not disturbed, any rescission 
of the Agreement and subsequent investigation may trigger unintended 
consequences for victims who have attempted to readjust their lives a decade 
after Epstein's conviction for a state offense. And victims' prior statements that 
they suffered emotional distress and were troubled by the prospect of any 
involvement in the government's investigation of Epstein, and the potential 
exposure of their identities, only heightens this concern. [Doc. 403-18 ¶ 12]. The 
government thus believes it is essential to understand these victims concerns 
prior to recommending a remedy. See Maryland v. Craig, 497 U.S. 836, 852,110 S. 
Ct. 3157, 3167 (1990) (recognizing the government's "compelling" interest "in the

trauma already endured by victims in this matter, and consideration of their 
concerns prior to imposing a remedy is vital to the Court's determination. 
Providing a reasonable period for the government to speak with victims is 
also important because both Petitioners and the government lack clarity about 
what victims want and how they may be affected by this matter. During the 
parties discussions, Petitioners acknowledged that they have consulted only a 
subset (less than a majority) of the victims. The parties also agree that victims are 
likely to hold varying opinions about an appropriate remedy, including those 
who are likely to oppose rescission of the Agreement. Accordingly, the 
government believes that a sixty-day period to confer with victims is the 
minimum amount of time needed to inform its judgment about a remedy so it 
can effectively advise the Court. 
In light of the government's expressed commitment to speak to victims about 
a remedy, Petitioners opposition to the government's request is disappointing 
and would lead to a flawed process. Petitioners counsel have cited multiple 
reasons for their opposition, none of which withstand scrutiny. 
First, counsel contend that the government has declined the opportunity to 
confer with victims over the past ten years, so it should not be given time to do 
so now. While the government understands Petitioners' concern regarding the 
prior efforts of the U.S. Attorney's Office of the Southern District of Florida to 
communicate with victims, undersigned counsel have repeatedly expressed to 
Petitioners our intention to speak with victims from the outset of our 
600 U.S. Courthouse, 75 Ted Turner Drive S.W., Atlanta, GA 30303

Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 451 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/10/2019 Page 8 of 14 
involvement in March 2019. Indeed, a different approach was necessitated by the 
different procedural posture of this case after the Court entered its order of 
partial summary judgment.2 [Doc. 435] Based on that order, the government now 
seeks to assist the Court's determination of a remedy through a recommendation 
informed by an understanding of the victims concerns. The government's 
commitment to confer with victims at the remedy stage has been, and will 
remain, firm. 
Second, Petitioners' counsel suggest that a period dedicated to conferring 
with victims would further delay proceedings. But the government's request for 
a sixty-day period to speak with victims after Petitioners' submission on 
remedies is reasonable, if not ambitious, particularly in light of the fact that 
Petitioners have only consulted with a subset of victims over the past ten years. 
The government does not seek an open-ended delay, but instead asks for a 
Petitioners' counsel also have suggested that the government's prior 
objection to their motion to add Jane Doe No. 3 and Jane Doe No. 4 as plaintiffs is 
inconsistent with the government's commitment to speak with victims. Not so. 
The government objected to their joinder based on legal infirmities in Petitioners' 
motion, including the untimely nature of the request, the statute of limitations, 
and the injection of new legal issues when Jane Doe No. 4 was not known to the 
government at the time of the Agreement. [Doc. 290 at 12-13; Doc. 314 at 23-24]. 
The Court agreed that adding Jane Doe No. 3 and Jane Doe No. 4 was improper 
this "late in the proceedings." [Doc. 324 at 7]. The government never asserted 
that the views of these victims could not be considered at the remedy stage.

reasonable chance to speak to as many victims as possible so that it can frame a 
proper remedy and inform the Court.3
Third, Petitioners counsel claim that the government could file its proposed 
remedy first and then amend its pleading later, if necessary, after speaking to 
victims. Such an approach would lessen, not promote, an efficient resolution by 
inviting the prospect of amended filings with accompanying multiple rounds of 
briefing. No judicial or victim interests are served in requiring the government to 
submit an incomplete filing lacking victim input before supplementing later. 
Most troubling, Petitioners counsel suggest that only the views of Jane Doe 
No. 1 and Jane Doe No. 2 should be relevant to a remedy, and that the Court 
should not consider the opinions of other victims given the certainty that some 
will hold differing views. The fact that victims likely have diverse concerns and 
opinions about the proper path forward makes it more essential, not less, that the 
Court have the benefit of their viewpoints for its consideration. The government 
trusts that Petitioners counsel will effectively advocate for Petitioners' desired 
relief. But Petitioners should not impede the Court's consideration of other 
Although Petitioners assert that the Court's "limited" extension granted in 
March gave the government enough time to confer with victims, this claim does 
not align with what the Court ordered the government to do, which was to 
confer with Petitioners regarding the procedures for deciding a remedy after 
reviewing the voluminous pleadings in this matter. [Doc. 448 at 1-2]. The 
government has worked diligently to do so.

victims who may be affected by a remedy, particularly when the parties have not 
spoken to the majority of them. 
Accordingly, the government's request for a sixty-day period to speak to 
victims who may be affected by a remedy should be granted. Such a process is 
fair to Petitioners, just to the victims, and essential for the Court. 
2. Petitioners should file a pleading setting forth their requested remedy to 
clarify the relief sought before the government's response. 
The parties disagree as to which party should submit the initial statement 
setting forth a recommended remedy, but general rules of civil practice, the 
statutory language of the Crime Victims Rights Act ("CVRA"), and the judicial 
interest in an efficient resolution of this matter require Petitioners to identify 
their remedy first. 
General principles of civil practice require the plaintiff to identify the relief 
requested. Civil complaints must contain "a demand for the relief sought." Fed. 
R. Civ. P. 8(a)(3). No authority supports Petitioners' apparent position that if a 
plaintiff subsequently establishes a claim for relief, the burden shifts to the 
respondent to propose the remedy to be entered. Simply stated, Petitioners must 
identify the specific relief they seek to accord the government with fair notice 
and an opportunity to respond. 
Contrary to Petitioners' contentions, the CVRA does not mandate a different 
result. The "Enforcement and Limitations" provisions of the CVRA, 18 U.S.C. 
§ 3771(d), outline the remedial steps that may be taken by victims seeking to

Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 451 Entered on FLSD Docket 05/10/2019 Page 11 of 14 
assert their rights enumerated in 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a). Specifically, Section 3771(d) 
provides that victims may seek relief for any violation of their CVRA rights, 
states that victims may do so by filing a motion, and sets forth limitations on 
remedies that may be granted under the CVRA. 18 U.S.C. §§ 3771(d)(1), (d)(3), 
(d)(5)-(6). Although Section 3771(d) does not explicitly state which party must 
recommend specific relief in all cases, it does identify the party who must make a 
motion for at least one of the potential remedies: "the victim." 18 U.S.C. 
§ 3771(d)(5). If the "victim" must make a request to reopen a plea or sentence, id., 
it is incumbent on Petitioners to file a pleading setting forth their requested 
remedy if they seek to reopen the Agreement here. 
In an improper effort to shift this burden to the government, Petitioners claim 
that a different CVRA subsection, Section 3771(c), which is separate from the 
Section 3771(d) remedial provisions, requires the government to file first. But this 
provision merely sets forth the general principle that the government should 
"make their best efforts" to notify victims of their rights under the CVRA. 18 
U.S.C. § 3771(c)(1). To the extent that this provision has any bearing on this issue, 
the government's request for reasonable time to confer with victims, and to 
thereby treat them with "fairness and respect for the victim's dignity and 
privacy," represents the government's best efforts to accord the victims their 
rights at this stage. 18 U.S.C. §§ 3771(a)(5), (a)(8). 
In addition, an initial statement from Petitioners clarifying the specific 
remedies sought will facilitate a more efficient resolution because it will focus the

government's discussions with victims. It is presently unclear what relief 
Petitioners believe is suitable in this case. Shortly after initiating this lawsuit, 
Petitioners counsel stated that "because of the legal consequences of invalidating 
the current agreement, it is likely not in my clients' best interest to ask for the 
relief that we initially asked for." [Doc. 403-21 at 4]. Three years later, Petitioners 
proposed a list of more than a dozen potential remedies, including the rescission 
of the Agreement. [Doc. 127 at 14-15]. In recent discussions, Petitioners have not 
identified what, if any, of these remedies they will seek in addition to some form 
of rescission of the Agreement. The government needs to know what remedies 
Petitioners propose in order to speak openly and effectively with victims about 
their views on relief. Delaying the Petitioners pleading would force the 
government either to have multiple discussions with victims before and after 
receiving clarity on Petitioners' requested relief, or to forgo discussions with 
victims until both parties had already recommended relief without victim input. 
This proposal is neither efficient nor serves the victims interests. 
Accordingly, Petitioners should set forth their requested relief, followed by 
the government's responsive brief after a reasonable period to confer with 
victims.

Still, some details about Doe's lawsuit are raising eyebrows—in particular because 
the allegations seem to match up with at least one of Epstein's alleged co-
conspirators. 
If this complaint was filed by one of his co-conspirators, 
who "played an outsized role in Jeffrey Epstein's 
devastating abuse of minors for over a decade and 
profited handsomely including owning a company 
affiliated with Epstein, it is a brazen abuse of our civil 
justice system," said Sigrid McCawley, a partner at 
Boies Schiller Flexner LLP who represents multiple 
victims of Epstein. "But above all, it is a shameless act 
and a disgraceful insult to the real victims."

Subject: Congrats and a Caution re: Maxwell Indictment & Apprehension 
Date: Thu, 02 Jul 2020 17:28:04 +0000 
Mr. 
I am a former prosecutor (Kings County DA, 1987-91, 1996-99) and helped lay the foundation for that Office's Crimes Against Children 
Bureau by setting up and hosting the first meeting of the NYPD Pedophilia Squad with prosecutors and Detective-Investigators from my 
Office in 1996. Preet Bharara speaks very highly of you. 
Congratulations to you, Geoff Berman, 
and your outstanding team of dedicated line prosecutors who put this case together, 
as well as to the FBI agents and NYPD detectives who worked it. 
Please realize that there is a great deal of apprehension amongst the public at large, and extending to some individuals in law enforcement 
and corrections, that the MCC is not a secure facility and that Jeffrey Epstein's death there last summer was a homicide. Knowing, as I do, 
of the manpower, training and management problems which have plagued the BOP and seem to be endemic at the MCC, concerns about 
Ms. Maxwell's safety are not unfounded. 
I hope that your Office will seek remand and that Maxwell will be kept isolated in a private cell and monitored 24/7 by multiple cameras 
with all approaches to her cell covered and no blind spots, and that the feed from same will be monitored by a team of federal Marshalls 
assigned to your Office. 
As I told BJ Pak when his Office contacted me a few years ago, I believe that the victims of the Epstein-Maxwell criminal organization or 
conspiracy were badly failed by Alex Acosta. I am happy to see that more competent and independent prosecutors are, at last, close to 
bringing their victims some measure of justice, however belated. 
Yours very truly, 
Peter

GHISLAINE MAXWELL CHARGED IN MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURT FOR 
CONSPIRING WITH JEFFREY EPSTEIN TO SEXUALLY ABUSE MINORS 
Maxwell is Alleged to Have Facilita- ted, Participated in Acts of Abuse 
Additionally Charged With Perjury in Connection With 2016 Depositions 
Audrey Strauss, the Acting United States Attorney- for the Southern District of New York, William F. 
Sweeney Jr., the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation ("FBI"), and Dermot Shea, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department ("NYPD"), 
announced that GHISLANE MAXWELL was arrested this morning and charged with enticing a minor to travel 
to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, 
conspiracy to commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. The Indictment 
unsealed today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 through 1997, MAXWELL and co-conspirator 
Jeffrey Epstein exploited girls as young as 14, including by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the 
purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference for young girls, 
EFTA00027847
--- PAGE 2 ---
MAXWELL played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations 
including New York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, MAXWELL made several false 
statements in sworn depositions in 2016. MAXWELL is expected to be presented this afternoon in the in federal 
court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan. 
Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated, aided, and 
participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then 
delivered them into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust. 
All the while, she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself. 
Today, after many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the 
most important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the 
law and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth into 
behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the quest for 
justice has been met with great disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. The 
example set by the women involved has been a powerful one. They persevered against the rich and connected, 
and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a subpoena - and they stood together. I have no doubt the bravery 
exhibited by the women involved here has empowered others to speak up about the crimes of which they've been 
subjected." 
NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said: "The heinous crimes these charges allege are, and always will 
be abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement 
partners, for their continuing commitment to bringing justice to the survivors of sexual assault, everywhere." 
If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, please contact 
the FBI at 1-800-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
According to the Indictment[ I I unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated 
in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, 
which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies or 
taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at 
ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. 
Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to accept offers of 
financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. MAXWELL also 
normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, encouraging them to massage 
Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and 
susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between 
minor victims and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL 
was present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages 
during which a minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein 
involving a minor victim where MAXWELL was present. 
EFTA00027848
--- PAGE 3 ---
As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching 
of a victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to 
touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and 
Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as 
well as MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal 
sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to 
travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of 
transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, which carries a maximum sentence of 
years in prison, one count of conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual 
activity, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and two counts of perjury, each of which 
carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
The statutory maximum penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational 
purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be determined by the judge. 
Ms. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and the NYPD. 
This case is being handled by the Office's Public Corruption Unit. Assistant U.S. Attorneys 
and 
are in charge of the prosecution. 
The charges contained in the Indictment are merely accusations. The defendant is presumed innocent 
unless and until proven guilty.

GHISLAINE MAXWELL CHARGED IN MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURT FOR 
CONSPIRING WITH JEFFREY EPSTEIN TO SEXUALLY ABUSE MINORS 
Maxwell is Alleged to Have Facilita- ted, Participated in Acts of Abuse 
Additionally Charged With Perjwy in Connection With 2016 Depositions 
Audrey Strauss, the Acting United States Attorney- for the Southern District of New York, William F. 
Sweeney Jr., the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation ("FBI"), and Dermot Shea, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department ("NYPD"), 
announced that GHISLANE MAXWELL was arrested this morning and charged with enticing a minor to travel 
to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, 
conspiracy to commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. The Indictment 
unsealed today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 through 1997, MAXWELL and co-conspirator 
Jeffrey Epstein exploited girls as young as 14, including by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the 
purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference for young girls, 
EFTA00027850
--- PAGE 2 ---
MAXWELL played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations 
including New York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, MAXWELL made several false 
statements in sworn depositions in 2016. MAXWELL is expected to be presented this afternoon in the in federal 
court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan. 
Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated, aided, and 
participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then 
delivered them into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust. 
All the while, she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself. 
Today, after many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the 
most important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the 
law and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth into 
behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the quest for 
justice has been met with great disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. The 
example set by the women involved has been a powerful one. They persevered against the rich and connected, 
and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a subpoena - and they stood together. I have no doubt the bravery 
exhibited by the women involved here has empowered others to speak up about the crimes of which they've been 
subjected." 
NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said: "The heinous crimes these charges allege are, and always will 
be abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement 
partners, for their continuing commitment to bringing justice to the survivors of sexual assault, everywhere." 
If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, please contact 
the FBI at 1-800-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
According to the Indictment[ I I unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated 
in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, 
which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies or 
taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at 
ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. 
Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to accept offers of 
financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. MAXWELL also 
normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, encouraging them to massage 
Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and 
susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between 
minor victims and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL 
was present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages 
during which a minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein 
involving a minor victim where MAXWELL was present. 
EFTA00027851
--- PAGE 3 ---
As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching 
of a victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to 
touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and 
Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as 
well as MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal 
sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to 
travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of 
transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, which carries a maximum sentence of 
years in prison, one count of conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual 
activity, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and two counts of perjury, each of which 
carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
The statutory maximum penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational 
purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be determined by the judge. 
Ms. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and the NYPD. 
This case is being handled by the Office's Public Corruption Unit. Assistant U.S. Attorneys 
and 
are in charge of the prosecution. 
The charges contained in the Indictment are merely accusations. The defendant is presumed innocent 
unless and until proven guilty.

until they're able to arrange for that. Anyone I can point them toward on that issue?? This seems way outside

Thanks for being available today and for getting the wheels turning for an investigation into how he died. 
On a related note, we are hearing that Jeffrey's autopsy may occur tomorrow morning. We would like to have 
a pathologist present for his autopsy and cannot line up someone on such short notice. Is there any way to 
push the autopsy off until Tuesday to give us time to do that?

We write to raise a few issues concerning the discovery. Below is the list of items. Please let me know if you are free for a 
call to discuss. 
1. On our last call, we asked you if we could send our client a hard drive containing the discovery that we had created 
(without the highly confidential items). You had said you would check to see if you could facilitate this. We have 
not heard back from you. Are you able to send Ms. Maxwell the hard drive? 
2. The last two productions you sent to Ms. Maxwell on disks. As you know, she cannot read disks on her laptop and 
must use the prison computer. But the prison computer cannot read some of the files. We can include these files 
EFTA00027861
--- PAGE 2 ---
on our hard drive to send to Ms. Maxwell. Otherwise, you will need to produce them on a hard drive. Please 
advise which way you would like to proceed. 
3. A number of the emails in the discovery — over 109,000 — were produced without their attachments (see tab 1 of 
the attached Excel file). Instead, the attachments appear as slip-sheets (see example attached). Please provide the 
missing attachments, if they exist. 
4. A number of electronic documents — over 110,000 — that were extracted from one of Epstein's devices, as identified 
by a CART number, have metadata that indicates a "date created" or "date last modified" date in July 2020 or 
afterwards (see tab 2 of the attached Excel file). We request that you produce a metadata overlay with the original 
metadata for these files. 
5. A number of photographs — over 6500 — were produced in native format, but do not have a CART number and have 
"date created" and/or "date last modified" dates after July 2019 (see tab 3 of the attached Excel file). Please 
provide the CART number for these photographs or specify which device they came from. Also, we request that 
you produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files. 
6. A number of the audio/visual files — over 460 — have similar metadata issues (see tab 4 of the attached Excel file). 
These fall into the following buckets: 
a. SDNY GM SUPP: these have CART numbers, but were produced without metadata load files and have 
"date created" and "date last modified" dates in September-November 2020, after the date the device was 
seized. We request that you produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files. 
b. SDNY005 (October 20 2020 production): these are a few videos from the SDFL or PBPD investigations that 
were produced in native form without metadata load files. They have Sept-Oct 2020 dates. We request that 
you produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files. 
c. SDNY011 (November 9 2020 production): these were produced in native form with load files, but do not 
reference a CART number and have Sept 2020 dates. We request that you provide a CART number for these 
files or indicate their source. Also, we request that you produce a metadata overlay with the original 
metadata for these files. 
7. There is a gap between 11/18 and 12/18 production numbers (SDNY_GM_02742044 to 2742183). Was that 
intentional or are we missing those documents? 
Please let us know your responses as soon as possible.

Hi[, 
We just received the below and attached regarding discovery in the Maxwell case. Many of these questions relate to 
productions that PAE prepared. Would you please take a look and let me know when would be a good time this week for 
a call to discuss?

Subject: Discovery Issues 
and M
—
We write to raise a few issues concerning the discovery. Below is the list of items. Please let me know if you are free for a 
call to discuss. 
1. On our last call, we asked you if we could send our client a hard drive containing the discovery that we had created 
(without the highly confidential items). You had said you would check to see if you could facilitate this. We have 
not heard back from you. Are you able to send Ms. Maxwell the hard drive? 
2. The last two productions you sent to Ms. Maxwell on disks. As you know, she cannot read disks on her laptop and 
must use the prison computer. But the prison computer cannot read some of the files. We can include these files 
on our hard drive to send to Ms. Maxwell. Otherwise, you will need to produce them on a hard drive. Please 
advise which way you would like to proceed. 
3. A number of the emails in the discovery— over 109,000 — were produced without their attachments (see tab 1 of 
the attached Excel file). Instead, the attachments appear as slip-sheets (see example attached). Please provide the 
missing attachments, if they exist. 
4. A number of electronic documents — over 110,000 —that were extracted from one of Epstein's devices, as identified 
by a CART number, have metadata that indicates a "date created" or "date last modified" date in July 2020 or 
afterwards (see tab 2 of the attached Excel file). We request that you produce a metadata overlay with the original 
metadata for these files. 
EFTA00027864
--- PAGE 2 ---
5. A number of photographs — over 6500 — were produced in native format, but do not have a CART number and have 
"date created" and/or "date last modified" dates after July 2019 (see tab 3 of the attached Excel file). Please 
provide the CART number for these photographs or specify which device they came from. Also, we request that 
you produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files. 
6. A number of the audio/visual files — over 460 — have similar metadata issues (see tab 4 of the attached Excel file). 
These fall into the following buckets: 
a. SDNY GM SUPP: these have CART numbers, but were produced without metadata load files and have 
"date created" and "date last modified" dates in September-November 2020, after the date the device was 
seized. We request that you produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files. 
b. SDNY005 (October 20 2020 production): these are a few videos from the SDFL or PBPD investigations that 
were produced in native form without metadata load files. They have Sept-Oct 2020 dates. We request that 
you produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files. 
c. SDNY011 (November 9 2020 production): these were produced in native form with load files, but do not 
reference a CART number and have Sept 2020 dates. We request that you provide a CART number for these 
files or indicate their source. Also, we request that you produce a metadata overlay with the original 
metadata for these files. 
7. There is a gap between 11/18 and 12/18 production numbers (SDNY_GM_02742044 to 2742183). Was that

Sorry but I don't believe this voucher is accurate, similar to the prior one. First, it appears to allocate one night of the 
hotel to the travel card, which is incorrect—the entirety of the hotel was paid on my personal card (please see attached 
email and I'm again sending the hotel invoice). Additionally, it doesn't appear to include the hotel tax of $ 70.12, which I 
also paid on my personal credit card. 
Please let me know when it's corrected and I'll review again. Thanks.

Alex, regarding the Transient Occupancy Tax, LA County is tax exempt. I've contacted Doubletree by Hilton Santa Monica 
for a refund for those charges. Thanks for your patience in this matter. 
u Ject: RE: Final Voucher 
prepared y a travel arranger is pending your review 
Unfortunately this is still incorrect. First, it has the nightly lodging costs listed as $248 when in fact it was $247 — see the 
invoice, which is attached again. (Or please let me know if I'm supposed to be reimbursed for the maximum daily 
allowance rather than the actual cost.) Also it still does not include the tax. 
Please let me know when it is corrected and I will review it again.

THE DEPUTY CLERK: In the matter of Doe v. Indyke. 
Counsel, please state your name for the record beginning with 
plaintiff. 
MS. KAPLAN: Good morning. Roberta Kaplan for 
plaintiff from Kaplan Hecker & Fink. I am here with my 
colleagues Kate Doniger, Alex Conlon, and Louis Fisher. 
THE COURT: Good morning. 
MR. MOSKOWITZ: Good morning. Bennet Moskowitz, 
Troutman Sanders LLP, counsel for the co-executors of the 
Estate of Jeffrey D. Epstein. 
MR. GLOVER: And Charles Glover of the same firm. 
THE COURT: First of all, I thank you very much for 
your indulgence. As you could see, we did not know until we 
knew that plaintiff in our prior case did not speak English. 
He was comfortable with the dates of a conference and not more 
than that. So I appreciate your patience. 
Let me begin by noting that I'm surprised we are 
having this conference, even though I am the one who convened 
it. And that is because what I thought made sense from an 
efficiency perspective was to have the discovery assigned to a 
single magistrate judge, and which is what was done. The 
reason that I'm having this conference, and Judge Freeman is 
not, is it does not appear that the discussion of motions to 
strike or motion practice is occurring in all of the cases. 
And so for those in which it is happening, those judges have 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00027885
--- PAGE 3 ---
JCB3DOEC 
decided to talk about it. 
I'm asking in the first instance to speak with 
Mr. Moskowitz, unless he wants to pass the mic over to 
Mr. Glover. 
Mr. Moskowitz, I had understood, from a very sort of 
peripheral perspective, that the focus of your clients was on 
setting up a fund to perhaps fund the settlement of these 
claims. Am I correct? 
MR. MOSKOWITZ: That's absolutely correct. 
THE COURT: I'll ask you to stand only because there 
is a monitor in front of you. 
MR. MOSKOWITZ: I prefer it. Thank you. That's 
absolutely correct. That is still a major focus of my clients. 
In fact, it's full steam ahead. I understand that, as has been 
described when we were before Judge Freeman and before then, I 
understand that the administrators-to-be, Ken Feinberg, 
, Camille Biyos, all leading people in the field of 
claims administration, has been in touch with or have reached 
out to various plaintiffs' counsel. And the administrators are 
working on the protocol, which is basically the nuts and bolts 
of that program. 
It's our hope and expectation that all plaintiffs will 
give it a shot. It doesn't require anything in terms of 
waiving any rights. They can go through the whole claims 
process, get an independent determination -- the estate doesn't 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00027886
--- PAGE 4 ---
JCB3DOEC 
control the program administrators or designers -- and if given 
plaintiff doesn't like that determination, they can say, you 
know what, I don't like this, I am going back to concentrate on 
my litigation. 
I too, although, you know, I'm hoping people come 
around, and I'm disappointed as of now no one has come to us 
and said I am going to give it a shot, let's stay the 
litigation in the meantime. But it's not required. The 
administrators aren't requiring that. 
THE COURT: This is the fork in the road where you and 
I diverge. I would have thought given your focus was on 
setting up a fund for claims administration you would not be 
focusing on motions to strike, which to me seemed to be a --
not a distraction, but a detour in the path to resolution of 
the case. 
MR. MOSKOWITZ: I see. If I can, I gather, but I'll 
ask the question, your Honor is wondering that based on your 
Honor's understanding of what the law is, on whether what we 
are talking about here is, as Ms. Kaplan asserted in her letter 
a motion to strike, or as I'll gladly briefly go over is 
actually, no, a motion to dismiss. 
And the reason we made the motion is because I would 
have loved to push the time out more. But plaintiff's counsel 
wasn't willing to do that. We have preserved our rights. A 
critical threshold issue for us, I have six points to briefly 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00027887
--- PAGE 5 ---
JCB3DOEC 
touch upon, I'll be very quick, that will address that. 
But, it's very important to us that we be able to move 
to dismiss, which is what it is, the punitive damages claims. 
THE COURT: Okay. But, that wouldn't get rid of all 
of the claims. 
MR. MOSKOWITZ: No. 
THE COURT: I am trying to figure out why expend -- _ 
am not using the term waste -- why expend the resources when, 
at some point, perhaps, we can have a discussion about whether 
or not Virgin Islands permits law permits punitive damages or 
not. 
I am just trying to understand, because things were 
going so well, I thought. You've had your initial conference 
before Judge Freeman, there are discussions that I imagine were 
going on. There was, I presume, the establishment of protocols 
for discovery. And this, again, just seems like something that 
is inconsistent with everything that's been going on before 
her. 
So perhaps I need to hear some or all of your six 
points and I will listen to you. 
MR. MOSKOWITZ: Sure. Well, plaintiff's counsel 
generally, not all of them, but plaintiff's counsel here today 
included has made it clear to us that they are not yet sold, 
that's my wording, on the program. And unless and until they 
tell us otherwise, they are moving full steam ahead with their 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00027888
--- PAGE 6 ---
JCB3DOEC 
litigation. So we are basically having to react to that. 
In terms of making motions, your Honor is correct, 
we've again, if we had it our way, we wouldn't have to engage 
in this practice on either side. We would stay everything. 
But we're here, and the reason moving to dismiss punitive 
damages in this case is so important to us and worth the time 
and energy now we are already halfway there to briefing and 
having this issue decided is two fold. 
Number one, the scope of discovery, ever since the 
2015 amendments, now expressly as I think it did previous to 
that contemplates that the amount in controversy is directly 
relevant to the scope of discovery. This is a very different 
case, from our perspective, because no punitive damages are 
available than plaintiff, if they do, we think incorrectly 
believe punitive damages are available. 
People, as I'm sure your Honor is aware, make very 
large claims for punitive damages. That's out of the case and 
should be as a threshold. 
The second is going to the claims program, or any 
other settlement because, you know, Judge Freeman asked me 
this, well, can someone talk to you about settlement separate 
from the claims program. Absolutely. They all have my phone 
number. Nothing is off the table. We hope everyone will give 
that claims program a shot. Why wouldn't you. I don't see 
why. In the meantime, if someone wants to talk about 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00027889
--- PAGE 7 ---
JCB3DOEC 
settlement, fine. 
How can the parties in this case see eye to eye if 
plaintiffs, again, I think clearly and incorrectly say and we 
are entitled to X millions punitive versus we are saying we are 
talking about compensatory damages. Let's have a discussion 
about that. 
THE COURT: Let's be clear. Assuming, as you'd like me 
to do, the exclusion of punitive damages, the claim's not going 
to be for ten dollars. It is going to be for millions upon 
millions of dollars. 
discovery is going to 
sought and the nature 
And do you really think the scope of 
change, given the nature of the damages 
of the claims raised? 
MR. MOSKOWITZ: Well, I do -- part of the clarity that 
I don't have, which I welcome to get, not trying to make my own 
questions, don't have clarity on how much is plaintiff claiming 
is owed to her in terms of punitive versus compensatory 
damages. It's not clear to me from the complaint. I haven't 
heard that yet, so it's hard for me to answer that question. 
But, I'm happy to answer questions in the order that your Honor 
desires. 
There is one other, I mentioned I had these six 
points. It Is often the case we don't come in and do things 
how I want. I want to raise another critical threshold issue 
that came up entirely because of what was in the contents of 
plaintiff's counsel's response to my letter, and that is if 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00027890
--- PAGE 8 ---
JCB3DOEC 
they are correct that USVI law applies, this action is time 
barred. Every cause of action that is asserted in their 
complaint says it is timely because of the New York Child 
Victims Act. Well, it stands to reason that if U.S. Virgin 
Islands law applies in this case, then the plaintiff cannot 
avail herself of the New York Child Victims Act. That is 
certainly something that I also now need to brief, and would, 
like I said, that's a key threshold issue even more so than 
punitive damages. There can be no case if there is no New York 
Child Victims Act applying. It's time barred. 
THE COURT: Not to put words in your mouth, but what 
I'm understanding is that you believe your premotion letter is 
not inconsistent with your desire to have a claims resolution 
process. It is, rather, something you feel is thrust upon you 
by the fact that today, not all of the plaintiffs' counsel are 
interested in participating in the program that you're setting 
up. 
MR. MOSKOWITZ: Yes. Let me clarify that, too. 
That's correct, but various plaintiffs' lawyers have indicated 
to me that they are interested. In fact, and a big issue 
before Judge Freeman was various plaintiffs' lawyers reached 
out to me and others that represent the executors before these 
actions got filed in the case, certainly before they began in 
earnest, to say they wanted a kind of claims program. It was 
something we were already thinking about on our end. This was 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00027891
--- PAGE 9 ---
JCB3DOEC 
not something that was just thrust out here. 
I don't want to rehash during Judge Freeman's hearing 
there was a disagreement about the way it's unfolded, etc., and 
that's not why we're here. 
Your Honor is correct, having the final motion to 
dismiss now, I wish we could put it off for three months and 
see if the claims program works and save the dockets, but here 
we are. And again, we think that punitive damages and now 
again USVI law applies as being time barred. These are key 
issues we can't avoid. These are straightforward legal issues. 
These will not be 50-page briefs. The motions I filed in other 
cases have all been on the concise side I'll call it, which I'm 
sure is something your Honor would appreciate. This can be 
done on a relatively short time frame. 
These are threshold issues. Certainly the time bar 
aspect, and I still argue the punitives and subject to I'd love 
to know what is plaintiff asking for in terms of punitive 
damages. 
Based on a collective, not in this case, what I've 
heard from the plaintiffs' side is, for example, there is one 
case out there where two plaintiffs, not this firm, claim $100 
million. They don't say what part is which, they don't even 
allege they were underage at the time of the alleged harms to 
them, but we have the complaint at the time. We request $100 
million or another amount to be determined. That tells me we 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00027892
--- PAGE 10 ---
IC 
JCB3DOEC 
need to set clarity where we can on the front end to make 
things more efficient going forward. 
THE COURT: Thank you. 
Ms. Kaplan, I'll hear from you in response. 
MS. KAPLAN: Yes, your Honor. So, I think I heard 
Mr. Moskowitz say that various plaintiffs' lawyers are not yet 
sold on the proposed settlement process. 
THE COURT: That's the word that was used, yes. 
MS. KAPLAN: That might be the understatement of the 
day, your Honor. First of all, there is no fund. In response 
to questions from the plaintiffs, Mr. Moskowitz responded by 
saying that no amount of money is actually being set aside by 
the estate to settle these claims. That is something that is 
very, very concerning to the plaintiffs. It's one thing to 
agree to participate in a fund when you know that, say, 300 or 
400 million of the 577 million in the estate is being set 
aside. But they have said that no amount is being set aside. 
They just want to settle claims, presumably, so they can settle 
as low as possible and have the rest for the estate. That's a 
huge problem. It is going to be a huge problem for the 
plaintiffs' lawyers. 
Number two, as Judge Freeman admonished Mr. Moskowitz 
when we met, settlement is a two-way street. There has to be 
consultation. The settlement -- the discussions that 
Mr. Moskowitz referred to, I was part of those, and I said to 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00027893
--- PAGE 11 ---
JCB3DOEC 
the estate that the plaintiffs needed to be involved. That 
these women who, many of whom, like my client, were horribly 
abused as young children, have to have agency. And they have 
to help pick the administrator, be involved in who the 
administrator is. None of that has happened. 
Mr. Moskowitz and the estate picked Ken Feinberg on 
their own. There was no consultation with us. We have now 
asked them to put on an administrator on a panel that the 
plaintiffs select. We've gotten no answer to that. 
With all respect, your Honor, I'm someone who has 
settled cases for decades in this district. This does not look 
to me like a case that's going to settle. 
If your Honor would like, I can move on to the merits 
issues. 
THE COURT: Please. 
MS. KAPLAN: With respect to this motion, whether it's 
styled as a motion to dismiss under 12(b)(6) or a motion to 
strike under 12(f), I've made those motions, I've always made 
them as 12(f) motions. I've never won one, but I've made them. 
However it's styled, your Honor said the fundamental important 
point here, which is not that it doesn't dismiss one claim, it 
dismisses no claims. We have compensatory damage sought in 
connection with all four of our claims. They have no motions 
to dismiss compensatory damage. They have no motion to dismiss 
any of the four underlying tort claims. 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00027894
--- PAGE 12 ---
JCB3DOEC 
For that reason, your Honor, there is really no reason 
not to get started. We are happy to have a conference with 
Judge Freeman, but the problem is the cases are in all 
different kind of configurations. There are many cases that 
don't require even responses until late January. There are 
cases with different defendants. There are cases with federal 
trafficking statutory claims. This is a simple diversity 
claim, common law claim. We are ready to get started. We 
don't think we should be delayed. 
With all respect to the Southern District, the way 
this has been set up where there is one magistrate but I think 
at least nine, maybe a dozen different judges now, give the 
plaintiffs all the disadvantages of consolidation and none of 
the advantages of consolidation. Because various issues are 
being decided by various district court judges, most of the 
judges are deciding pseudonymity. Your Honor has deferred that 
to Judge Freeman. It's kind of a big mess. 
We understand that Judge Freeman has jurisdiction over 
discovery. We would just like to start, and maybe if we could 
set a trial date today that would help get that underway. 
THE COURT: I'm not setting a trial date today. 
MS. KAPLAN: Let me talk about the scope of discovery. 
I will hereby make representation there is nothing about the 
damages claim that will affect the scope of discovery. 
We expect this case will have at most four witnesses. 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00027895
--- PAGE 13 ---
JCB3DOEC 
Maybe five. Our plaintiff, the two women who booked 
meetings -- that's not a right term. But massages with 
Mr. Epstein. I expect both of those women to take the Fifth, 
so that won't take very long, and maybe two experts. 
In terms of the documents that we are seeking, your 
Honor, again, it will be very limited. We don't know if they 
have written evidence about our client. We understand that 
these transactions were done in cash. I don't know if they 
kept records of who he met with when. Obviously, if he has 
that record, we'd like it. We don't expect a lot of documents 
from the plaintiff. 
And I should also add that we have opened a 
conversation with the U.S. attorney's office for the Southern 
District who may have one or two documents that corroborate our 
client's claims. They are thinking about how they can get 
those to us subject to grand jury requirements. 
the minute we get them, we will share them with

And obviously

with choice of 
whether Virgin 
Islands law applies to issues relating to what you can get from 
the estate, whether that's an estate choice of law issue, is 
entirely different from the question of what state substantive 
law applies to the underlying torts. 
I think there can be no question that given this 
happened on the streets of New York City, in his mansion, that 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00027896
--- PAGE 14 ---
JCB3DOEC 
the law, the substantive law of tort applies New York law, and 
we clearly get the benefit of the New York statute on that. 
With respect to the estate and whether or not he 
purposefully availed himself two days before his death of the 
benefits Virgin Islands law, which he presumably thought was 
going to be an advantage to Mr. Epstein, and in fact it has 
been. It is incredibly difficult for us to deal with the 
Virgin Islands court, to get Virgin Island lawyers to file 
papers. There are 100 advantages to the estate being in the 
Virgin Islands. 
Having sought those advantages, they don't get to pick 
and choose and say for purposes of the punitive damages, we 
want New York law to apply. We're happy to brief that issue. 
Courts in the Southern District in civil cases apply different 
laws to different issues of cases in a single case all the 
time. There is nothing out of the ordinary about that, and 
there is no rule that requires that one state's law applies to 
all issues in the case, particularly when you have a 
particularized issue about estate law like this. 
I am happy to address anything else your Honor would 
want to address. 
Couple more points. Again, we don't think that 
discovery in this case should take very long, given the limited 
number of documents and witnesses. We would be willing to 
waive a jury trial, your Honor, to help expedite things. And 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00027897
--- PAGE 15 ---
JCB3DOEC 
again, we are very much eager to get things to happen here as 
quickly as possible. Our client has lived with this for many, 
many years, she's really desirous of putting this behind her, 
and I'm sure your Honor can appreciate that. 
THE COURT: Just before you sit down. I am 
understanding, as you began this discussion, the problems that 
you see and that your client sees in the process that's been 
identified by defense. I am assuming you've had the 
discussions with them, because you've told me that you have, 
regarding increased plaintiff involvement in the administration 
process. 
If they agreed, might you change your mind about the 
futility or not of the claims administration process? 
MS. KAPLAN: I think if they were willing to have a 
panel of administrators, at least one of whom, maybe there 
would be two, Mr. Feinberg is the one chosen by the plaintiffs 
and a third neutral, I certainly would be open to 
participating. But I am not open in participating in something 
that's been done entirely by them, completely in secret, by 
someone they chose, and without denominated amounts that they 
are setting aside. 
THE COURT: There's two stumbling blocks. One is the 
composition of the panel and the other is the need for some 
defined amount. 
MS. KAPLAN: It is very hard for the plaintiffs to 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00027898
--- PAGE 16 ---
JCB3DOEC 
figure out what they can expect without understanding what the 
denominator is, if you will. 
THE COURT: Understood. Thank you. Mr. Moskowitz. 
MR. MOSKOWITZ: Thank you. Your Honor, it's 
interesting. First, as to the motion, we think we have a 
fundamental right to make and intend to make. Plaintiff's 
counsel does not dispute that under New York law, punitive 
damages are not available. USVI law appears to me to be in 
accord with that. By the way --
THE COURT: No. Let me understand why you think it's 
in accord. I found it, I found it an interesting issue. I 
didn't see much in the way of cases in the Virgin Islands that 
dealt with the issue. I thought I understood that the Virgin 
Islands law tends to be accepting of common law and the law of 
other jurisdictions that doesn't seem to conflict. 
MR. MOSKOWITZ: What you'll find is many Virgin 
Islands cases, and I will tell you I'm not -- I can brief it, 
but I cannot tell you now the current state of Virgin Islands 
law with respect to restatement. You will find cases, 
including from as recent as 2009, that refer to the restatement 
on the issue of punitive damage against an estate, and the 
restatement as well as the majority of U.S. jurisdictions, 
because we looked into this, are in accord. 
THE COURT: So this will be Section 908 and Section 
926? 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00027899
--- PAGE 17 ---
JCB3DOEC 
SPEAKER: I believe that's correct. I don't have it 
in front of me. I'm happy to pull that if I can after I finish 
speaking. But, there is Hamilton v. Dowson Holding, 51 VI 619, 
628 (DVI 2009); there is Booth v. Bowen, 2008 WL 220067, at *5 
(DVI Jan. 10, 2008). 
Candidly not Supreme Court USVI cases, but they are 
the authority that you will find on this issue in the USVI, and 
they are supportive of that restatement position. Which is not 
surprising. When someone's dead, you are not trying to punish 
them. Others would argue what about deterrence. The few cases 
I found work in our favor saying deterrence doesn't work like 
that. When someone is alive thinking if they die perhaps their 
estate will be impacted by this. This is not some obscure 
position. This is statutory law in a lot of places, including 
New York. 
In terms of the time issue, plaintiff's counsel also 
doesn't deny that if U.S. -- if New York law doesn't apply to 
that issue, this action is time barred. I'm surprised and I 
agree with Ms. Kaplan, this should be briefed. It should be 
briefed now. I am surprised to hear that it's routine that you 
get to pick and choose from one part of the case that X law 
applies --
THE COURT: I think that's an overstatement of what 
her argument was. I didn't hear the word "routine" mentioned 
at all. I have had cases, I'm sure you have as well, even 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00027900
--- PAGE 18 ---
JCB3DOEC 
basic contract cases where there are certain provisions that 
are subject to one jurisdiction of law and other claims that 
could be made on the same contract that would be under a 
different jurisdiction of law. 
MR. MOSKOWITZ: What I've seen, your Honor, is splits 
between procedural law and substantive law. We are talking 
about two very substantive issues here. Availability of a kind 
of damages and a right to revive a claim under New York 
statutory law that's part of a new trend but is, 
notwithstanding that, it relates to a reviving statute of 
limitations, gives it new vested substantive right to people to 
bring a claim that was otherwise previously time barred. 
THE COURT: To be clear, when you call it new trend, 
I'm sure you mean the law that actually provides for it. 
not like someone just woke up and decided let's do this. 
MR. MOSKOWITZ: Correct. 
THE COURT: Do you really think the tort issues in 
this case would be decided by Virgin Islands law? 
MR. MOSKOWITZ: No. That's why we were surprised to 
hear that in the response to our letter, which is why we came 
here, point number one was going to be that surprised us. But 
because of that suggestion, we number one need to brief it, 
because, as I said, and as has been denied, if USVI law applies 
wholesale or even to the two issues we are talking about, the 
action is time barred. Certainly that's a threshold issue that 
T t ' s 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00027901
--- PAGE 19 ---
JCB3DOEC 
needs to be decided now. 
THE COURT: I understand. I wouldn't be -- I wouldn't 
be so sure that it is time barred. 
I guess my question is, if you are hellbent on 
bringing this motion -- that's the legal term -- and it appears 
that you are, is it your belief that I should not have 
discovery while the motion is pending because, at most, well, 
you think possibly that instead of hitting the single of 
getting rid of punitive damages, you would hit the home run of 
getting rid of the case in its entirety? 
MR. MOSKOWITZ: Certainly something we would brief. 
Having heard it for the first time, in the response to our 
letter, and not wanting to do something which I don't like when 
other people do, which is seek leave to submit an unauthorized 
reply to your Honor, it's something we think needs to be dealt 
with now. But we think both issues need to be dealt with now. 
THE COURT: Let's step back. While your motion is 
being briefed, which, by the way, I haven't allowed just yet, 
what is the status of discovery? 
MR. MOSKOWITZ: So, number one --
THE COURT: What do you think it should be? 
MR. MOSKOWITZ: Oh sure. If it is limited, all the 
more reason not to get going with it now. Nothing is going to 
change in six weeks that's going to impact the plaintiff's 
rights. Look, I get it --
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00027902
--- PAGE 20 ---
JCB3DOEC 
THE COURT: What is the six weeks that you are 
thinking? 
MR. MOSKOWITZ: Sorry. That was a ballpark 
guesstimation, if we're briefing, I don't know how long it will 
take to brief --
THE COURT: You haven't figured out my schedule yet, 
which is not six weeks, but okay, nice try. 
MR. MOSKOWITZ: Noted. And some judges look at me the 
other way if you say three weeks versus nine. Good to know. 
But in terms of discovery, Magistrate Freeman, number 
one, has ordered the parties to report back to her on 
January 10 including about the claims program and discovery. 
So that issue's to be determined. I am hoping we can come to 
some agreement. I know Judge Freeman threw out some ideas on 
the transcript, I don't have that transcript in front of me. 
She was in good control of that issue. 
If I can, I'd like to take a brief moment to set some 
things clear about the claims program. It's the opposite of 
what plaintiff's counsel has asserted. That's correct, we 
haven't said only X million is devoted. What we have said in 
writing numerous times there is no aggregate cap on the amount 
that the independent administrator can deem appropriate to pay 
to people. If you say 10 million is in it, then it's 10 
million spread across however many joined. We are saying, no, 
we want people to join this program. Everything we are doing 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00027903
--- PAGE 21 ---
JCB3DOEC 
is we want people to join. 
Choosing Ken Feinberg. Ms. Kaplan did express extreme 
interest in having one person and one person only who was not 
Ken Feinberg. We vetted and interviewed many people, including 
that person. We made our own decision, that's true. Ken 
Feinberg has impeccable credentials. And this notion of 
appointing someone to a panel, this is not arbitration or 
mediation. This is an independent claims program. 
The estate -- we have no control at the end of the day 
over when Ms. 
who is the designer and administrator of 
the fund, when she makes a determination that I think this 
person should get X, we can't veto that. We can't impact that. 
All we can do is, when we hear about a claim, is say here's 
what we know about this claim that we think you should know 
about, and Ms. 
, just like she gets whatever evidence 
claimants make, can do what she wants with it. She can find 
what we say not important. And she makes a determination. 
So I am hearing this notion like we put two people, 
two or three people up there, first of all, it's one. And she 
is independent. I mean, these people have, that we've 
selected, and we were so careful about it. I am just shocked, 
and this is perhaps the only case where I've heard repeated 
objections to Ken Feinberg being --
THE COURT: I know who he is. 
MR. MOSKOWITZ: Right. So candidly, I hear words get 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00027904

JCB3DOEC 
thrown out. I'm honestly mystified by that. Who else better 
to ensure a successful claims program. It is not like we went 
out and hired our cousin. These are the leading people. 
, not as well known, worked on the 9/11 Fund for 
many, many years, just left the fund to do this program. She's 
very compassionate. She cares. They want this program to work 
and so do we. Various plaintiffs have told me they are 
interested too. 
THE COURT: To be clear, you don't have to sell me on 
it because I'm not participating one way or the other. 
Whatever PR work you are doing has failed, because here we are. 
And we are at motions practice and we are going with litigation 
because the efforts to sell folks on the claims resolution 
proceeding have not worked. 
MR. MOSKOWITZ: I don't think that's correct, your 
Honor. The time to sign up hasn't opened yet. 
THE COURT: All right. Why are you bringing this --
is it because there is otherwise a response due that you are 
not waiting to hear whether the folks at the front table are 
joining in the process or not? 
MR. MOSKOWITZ: I'm sorry. I don't think I understood 
the question. 
THE COURT: You just said to me now that people do not 
have to elect to participate or not participate today, they 
have a period of time. Correct? 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00027905
--- PAGE 23 ---
JCB3DOEC 
MR. MOSKOWITZ: Correct. 
THE COURT: Is that period of time the 10th of January 
or some date sooner than that? 
MR. MOSKOWITZ: I'm not certain. I know the protocol 
comes out very soon. Like in days or a week or so. And then 
shortly thereafter, it is a matter of months, so I don't have 
the exact date. But it's soon, it's very soon, it's not months 
from now. 
THE COURT: My understanding is that, first of all, 
you'd like more plaintiffs and their counsel to participate in 
the program. But, in the absence of that, you need to do 
something, and if it's to proceed with the litigation, you will 
proceed with the litigation. 
I was trying to understand, and I was trying to 
understand when I began this conference, why it was that you 
were bringing the motion now, if you are in the process of 
trying to persuade, encourage, entice people to participate in 
the claims resolution process. And I am assuming it is because 
otherwise you are going to be in default, and you have to do 
something. 
MR. MOSKOWITZ: That's right. I would have loved 
again to put off the date. But this to us, and I have cases, 
Judge Batts, Judge Buchwald, Judge Sweet, it is a motion to 
dismiss. We had to move. We had to respond to the complaint, 
and this is an important motion for us to make. 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00027906
--- PAGE 24 ---
JCB3DOEC 
Yes, in fact, the last time we adjourned the date, 1-
was without consent. We've been saying since the start, hey, 
let's save resources on both sides. Let's get the claims 
program going. 
Again, I do want to be clear, it's not been -- I know 
your Honor said maybe it was a PR failure. I don't think 
that's the accurate way to look at it. Again, we've heard 
various plaintiffs express that they are very interested. Time 
to actually make that public -- or sorry, not public. Make 
that official hasn't happened yet. 
THE COURT: Okay. Ms. Kaplan, are you not going to 
join in? I just want to know. 
MS. KAPLAN: I think it's very unlikely, your Honor. 
They keep referring to them as independent. I don't know how 
they properly use that adjective to describe Mr. Feinberg and 
his colleague Ms. 
here. They were chosen by the 
estate, they are being paid for by the estate, there was no - 
not only was there no participation by us, but any opportunity 
for us to weigh in on that was declined. And they have a 
fiduciary duty not to our clients, but to the estate. That's 
not independent under any definition of the word. 
And what I am hearing from him frankly causes me 
greater concern. This protocol, this is what we've heard all 
along. I don't know, maybe a week. Maybe two weeks. Maybe 
three weeks. We were supposed to participate in the protocol. 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00027907
--- PAGE 25 ---
JCB3DOEC 
What's he talking about? 
So we have very, very low confidence in the process, 
in the integrity of the process, in the ability of these women 
to have agency in their fates, and I think my client is very 
likely to go forward with litigation. 
THE COURT: All right. 
MS. KAPLAN: Highly likely. 
THE COURT: I didn't want to set a motion schedule. 
If we are going forward with the litigation, the folks at the 
back table have to respond. 
MS. KAPLAN: Understood. But nothing about their 
response is relevant to the motion about punitive damages. 
Again, it does not dismiss a single claim in the case. It 
doesn't relate to a single one of the one through 86 paragraphs 
of factual allegations in the complaint. All it relates to are 
three words in the prayer for relief at the end of the 
complaint, and we all acknowledge sitting here today that our 
client is entitled to compensatory damage. So I'm completely 
willing to brief the issue, your Honor. And I can talk about 
how the choice of law analysis would work here. But it 
shouldn't delay anything, frankly, your Honor. Because it 
won't change anything in terms of moving forward with 
discovery, and trial in the case. 
THE COURT: All right. I don't know I need to hear 
anything else. Mr. Moskowitz, last words? 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00027908
--- PAGE 26 ---
JCB3DOEC 
MR. MOSKOWITZ: Yes. If I can just give three cites 
where judges in this district, again, I think I referred to 
them earlier, Batts, Buchwald, and Sweet did dismiss on 
12(b)(6) motions claims for punitive damages. Happy to do so. 
If you want us to save it for the brief. 
THE COURT: That's fine. Well, I haven't yet 
scheduled the brief, and I want to think about the degree to 
which discovery runs concurrent with the brief. It is only for 
the punitive damages; is that not correct? 
MR. MOSKOWITZ: And the time bar issue which since 
THE COURT: We are back to that again. 
MR. MOSKOWITZ: It was a surprise to us. 
THE COURT: Of course. I make no final decisions but 
you're observing the skepticism with which I heard the time bar 
issue. Because I'm incapable of not expressing my emotions. 
So I understand that. But I don't think that's going to be 
carrying the day any time soon. 
I think I have what I need to go back and think about 
the issue and set a schedule. But I don't want to deprive 
either side the opportunity to say final words to me. 
Ms. Kaplan, anything else you wish me to know? 
MS. KAPLAN: Just briefly. I've become a student of 
the law of punitive damages and Mr. Moskowitz is right that the 
majority rule is to bar it, as we do in New York. But the 
jurisdictions that do that, at least in the United States, are 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00027909
--- PAGE 27 ---
JCB3DOEC 
all based on statute. New York has a statute that prohibits 
punitive damages against an estate. Virgin Islands has no such 
statute. We are not aware of any case, we researched the issue 
too in Virgin Islands, saying one way or the other whether that 
is the law. Although of course in other contexts, the courts 
in Virgin Islands refer to the restatement. 
The factors that courts would look to in deciding this 
issue is kind of the traditional factors. So the purpose of 
punitive damages in a case is deterrence of future wrongdoing. 
It's really honestly hard to imagine a case in which deterrence 
of future wrongdoing is not a stronger interest, particularly 
given the fact that Mr. Epstein can no longer be prosecuted 
criminally. There is nothing more important than deterring 
criminal sexual acts against young children. 
The countervailing perspective is whether it's unfair 
to punish the estate for the acts of the decedent. Typically, 
your Honor, as you can imagine, that comes up in the context of 
children. There is that famous line from Exodus in the Bible 
about punishing the children for the sins of the fathers. And 
since the Enlightenment in our country and in our world, we 
believe that you shouldn't punish children for the sins of the 
father. 
There is no children at issue in this estate. They 
have identified the sole beneficiary as Mr. Epstein's brother. 
At least since Mr. Epstein was prosecuted in Florida, his 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00027910
--- PAGE 28 ---
JCB3DOEC 
brother was fully aware of what Mr. Epstein did, and in fact, 
we have reason to believe his brother lives in a building owned 
partly owned by him, partly owned by Mr. Epstein, in which the 
the two women who did the booking of massages for these girls 
also lived. So, the idea that Mr. Epstein's brother is somehow 
innocent here, or should have the full benefits of the estate, 
based on those policy reasons, makes very, very little sense. 
And obviously, deterrence is really a huge factor 
here. This should never happen to any young girl ever again, 
certainly anywhere in New York or anywhere in this country. 
THE COURT: Thank you. Mr. Moskowitz, final thoughts? 
MR. MOSKOWITZ: Yes. I 
me that I'm happy to brief that, 
plenty of jurisdictions that not 
have various law 
number one, show 
based on statute 
in front of 
there are 
bar punitive 
damages against an estate. I have cases such as Lohr v. Byrd, 
522 So 2d 845, 846 (Fla. 1988), which is a Florida case that 
refutes any notion that deterrence is served by punishing a 
tortfeasor. And I am happy to brief all of those. 
THE COURT: All right. I will get back to the parties 
as soon as I can. I'm imagining one side or the other will be 
getting a transcript of this. If you do so, I'll receive it 
automatically. So I'll just imagine one of you will do that. 
Thank you very much.

Jordy, 
Thank you for your email. We appreciate your commitment to a program that is independent of the Estate, which we also 
view as a central feature of any viable alternative to litigation. As I'm sure you can understand, however, a claims 
resolution program in which the three decision-makers were selected and hired by the Estate—and, we presume, are 
being paid by the Estate—cannot be said to be independent. In our view, there is a straightforward solution to this 
otherwise intractable problem: the program should add a fourth administrator, selected by plaintiffs, and require that all 
claims decisions are rendered unanimously. 
We look forward to discussing this proposal with you. We suggest arranging a time to do so before the protocol is 
finalized, since it will be important to incorporate the input of an additional administrator into that process. We will, of 
course, also raise this with the Estate.

Thank you for your email. I hear your concerns and want to reiterate that this proposed Program is entirely voluntary and 
independent of the Estate. It in no way imposes a process or outcome on the victims, and will in no way be administered 
or controlled by the Estate. Those are signature features of the Program. 
As I mentioned in my email last week, Ken, Camille and I are in the process of drafting a claims protocol and plan to 
circulate it - in draft form — to you and your counterparts before the holidays, and welcome any input you may have at 
that time. We will provide ample time for you to review and respond to the draft protocol, and will be happy and 
available to discuss your comments before the protocol is finalized. 
We look forward to speaking with you.

On behalf of 
Jordy, 
Thank you for reaching out to us. We are writing back on behalf of (and copying) certain plaintiffs' counsel who 
appeared at an SDNY conference last week for sexual abuse survivors of Epstein. We intend no disrespect to 
you and your colleagues, but, candidly, we have serious concerns about the Estate's purported decision to 
impose a non-binding settlement process on our clients unilaterally. All of these women still struggle today 
because of the profound manipulation, objectification, and physical abuse to which Jeffrey Epstein subjected 
each of them. Regardless of your own significant experience and good intentions, the fact that the Estate chose 
an administrator without any participation, input, or consideration of our clients' views or wishes is 
disconcerting, particularly given the personal nature of the claims at issue. 
We are, of course, interested above all in advancing our clients' interests. As you may know, at a status 
conference last week in the Southern District, Magistrate Judge Freeman instructed counsel for the Estate and 
counsel for plaintiffs to engage in good faith discussions about any proposed claim resolution program. We 
have already directed a request for information on the proposed program to Bennet Moskowitz, and look 
forward to his response and to a productive dialogue with counsel ahead of the Jan. 10, 2019 deadline set by 
the Magistrate for an update on the status of our negotiations. Assuming that our settlement discussions with 
Defendants progress, we look forward to working with you at the appropriate time to design an effective and 
appropriate settlement program.

As you know, I will be serving as co-Designer, along with Ken Feinberg and Camille Biros, and Administrator of 
the proposed Epstein Victims' Compensation Program. I wanted to reach out to you to introduce myself, as I 
understand that you represent victims who have asserted, or may assert, claims of sexual abuse against Jeffrey 
Epstein or his Estate. I also wanted to reinforce the key guiding principles of the Program and give you a sense 
of timing in the near term. 
This proposed Program is purely voluntary, non-adversarial and entirely independent of the Estate. The Estate 
will have no authority whatsoever to interfere with the administration of the Program or the evaluation of 
individual claims.

Good afternoon Bobbi: 
• Christian Everdell 
As you noted Ms. Maxwell has continuously been produced in advance of 
12:30 PM. In addition, I would like to note that while Ms. Maxwell was produced after the scheduled time 
(twice), the additional time was provided to compensate for the delay. Please understand that while we are 
working to ensure all inmates are produced for their court and legal calls, there are institutional emergencies that 
require additional assistance, causing staff to slightly deviate from time frames. 
Should you request a copy of the incident report, Ms. Maxwell may provide you with it, however I cannot. I can 
further assure you that the daily searches are consistent with BOP Program Statement § 552.06, Searches of 
Housing Units, Inmates, and Inmate Work Areas. It is my understanding that gloves and masks were recently 
brought to the unit. 
Any further concerns you have indicated will be reviewed and addressed accordingly if need be. 
Thank you for your time and patience in this matter, 
>> 
1/7/2021 9:50 PM >» 
For the past two days, Ms. Maxwell has not been on time for the daily 
12:30 VTCs. Yesterday, she arrived at 12:59• today she arrived at 12:47. Until yesterday, Ms. Maxwell appeared 
in advance of 12:30. We appreciate 
assistance in facilitating Ms. Maxwell's appearance, but no 
explanation has been provided for these delays.. 
Each delay limits the time Ms. Maxwell can confer with counsel. We hope this will not be repeated and is not 
retribution for complaints made by counsel. 
We learned today that the complaint report issued to Ms. Maxwell earlier this week has now been revised. I 
renew my request for the original report and request a copy of the updated report. 
This morning at 6:40 am, the team leader ordered Ms. Maxwell to clean a toilet, providing a few paper towels, 
but no gloves, sending a clear message that Ms. Maxwell should clean the toilet bare handed, despite having 
cleaned the toilet the night before. Gloves were provided only upon request by Ms. Maxwell. Per the A&O 
Handbook, sanitation duties commence at 7:30 am for pretrial inmates (See A&O, p.4). We request that Ms. 
EFTA00027923
--- PAGE 2 ---
Maxwell be permitted to perform sanitation duties in the evening when returned to her isolation cell. 
Further, the team leader ordered Ms. Maxwell to clean crumbs from her bed. Lest she face another charge of 
being untidy, Ms. Maxwell attempted to comply but there were no crumbs - just stains on the blanket issued to 
her. This is another example of the petty officiousness displayed by the present team. 
The ear searches continue. Routinely, in connection with open mouth searches, guards run fingers through Ms. 
Maxwell's hair and behind her ears, at times before she gets a chance to put on her face mask.These searches -
conducted within 6 inches of Ms.Maxwell's face- continue to increase her risk of exposure to COVID. The 
number of daily searches of Ms. Maxwell, an isolated inmate under constant surveillance by multiple guards, 
seems excessive and unnecessarily violative..

It appears there is new information about the phone call at 7:17pm Friday night. 
The Warden briefed OIG SAC Modano that the call was 19 minutes long. I did not brief the Warden on any 
information regarding that call. 
Epstein was never in general population, because of that he did not need an approved list of people to call. 
On Friday he had a legal visit that lasted from 8:00ish an until almost 7:00pm. He was supervised the entire time 
by BOP staff.

2. There was a camera in the SHU that was pointed at the hallway and would have captured who was entering 
or looking into each cell. However, FBI/OIG was told yesterday by BOP that the camera had not been 
functioning since Thursday. FBI seized 18 hard drives of video from BOP and are analyzing them to confirm 
whether there was in fact any video. We hope to have a preliminary analysis done of the SHU camera by 
tomorrow. 
3. Epstein was removed from suicide watch on 7/29, and was not required to have a cellmate. His cellmate 
went to Court on Friday and was released from Court. There was not an officer responsible for assigning him 
a cellmate because it was not required. CMG has not interviewed any officers; we intend to start with an 
interview wita

The autopsy is happening this morning. We will continue to keep you posted. Please let us know if you have

I assume that in addition to the log for the 30 minute checks that there are also log slips for the two head 
counts at 3am and 5am. That's what I was told by BOP. 
With respect to the video, is there any video in that SHU that would show if the COs did the counts? 
Have they uncovered any information about why the Epstein did not have a cell mate ? Was the CO 
responsible for assigning Epstein a cell mate interviewed? I understand BOP has not talked to him.

has been desperately trying to figure out how he can cooperate, often relying on second- and third-hand

Thank you so much 
for getting back to me, my amazing lawyer Sigrid was able to get me there- due 
to the short notice & long flight I was afraid I was going to miss the hearing, so she got me there... 
impressive!! Thank you so much Sigrid!! 
On the return a 
that would be great if you could help out with the cost. I can give you my details if 
needed. Also due to an ongoing medical condition, I would need to fly business. It does help me with not 
being stuck in a position for 24+ hours. Thank you so very much!! 
All the best,

FYI, among several other recent requests and communications, Epstein's defense counsel says below that they would 
"welcome a call" with whoever is conducting the investigation into his death and have asked us to provide you with their 
contact information. Obviously leave it entirely to you whether you believe it would be appropriate or useful for your 
investigation to be in touch with them in any capacity. 
Separately, they have asked us to advise the individuals working on the investigation into Epstein's death that his brother, 
Mark Epstein, is represented by Stacey Richman, from the Law Offices of Murray Richman. Should you find it appropriate 
or useful for the investigation to be in touch with her (or him through her), it appears that the number of her and her 
father's firm is

in light of yesterday's seizures of computers in the Virgin Islands from Mr Epstein's residence or residences, and in 
light of the fact that emails and documents contained on some or all of these computers contain attorney-client and work 
product privileged communications, I request that you provide us assurance that they will not be accessed by the "case 
team" until a taint team is selected and until the procedures for a protection of those privileged communications is 
established. You have agreed to that protocol for the phones seized from Mr. Epstein on July 6 and the computers etc 
seized from his NYC residence shortly thereafter. I have a list of attorneys that I am prepared to send to a taint prosecutor 
once one is identified to me. 
Second, there remains the timing of the dismissal of the charge against Mr. Epstein. Are you awaiting a motion to dismiss 
from us? Will the Indictment be nolle prossed today? Is there a reason for any delay beyond today?

LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT 
OF 
JEFFREY E. EPSTEIN 
I, JEFFREY E. EPSTEIN, a resident and domiciliary of St. Thomas, United States Virgin Islands, 
do make, publish and declare this to be my Will hereby revoking all prior Wills and Codicils made 
by me. 
1: 
I direct my Executor to pay from my estate all expenses of 
my last illness, my funeral and burial expenses, the administration expenses of my estate and all of 
my debts duly proven and allowed against my estate. 
A. 
I direct my Executor to pay from my estate, as compensation 
to each Executor for serving as Executor hereunder, the sum of Two Hundred Fifty Thousand 
Dollars ($250,000) to each Executor upon the completion of probate of my estate. No Executor 
shall receive any other compensation for serving as Executor hereunder; provided, however, that 
my Executor shall be reimbursed from my estate for all reasonable costs, expenses, charges, and 
liabilities incurred or paid in respect thereto, including fees and expenses of counsel or any other 
agents hired by my Executor, and my Executor shall not be liable therefor individually. 
B. 
I direct my Executor to pay from my estate the federal and 
state transfer taxes described in Paragraph B(1) of Article SEVENTH. 
C. 
I direct my Executor to pay from my estate all expenses of 
storing, insuring, packing, shipping and delivering my tangible personal property in accordance with 
the provisions of Article SECOND. 
2: 
I give all of my property, real and personal, wherever situated, after 
the payments and distributions provided in Article FIRST, to the then acting Trustees of The 1953 
Trust ("Trust') created under that certain Trust Agreement of The 1953 Trust (the 'Trust 
Agreement') dated August 8, 2019, as the same may be amended from time to time, to be held in 
accordance with the provisions comprising the Trust Agreement at the time of my death. 
3: 
I appoint DARREN IC INDYKE and RICHARD D. 
KAHN to serve as the Executors of this Will. If any one or more of my Executors fails to qualify, is 
unable or unwilling to serve or ceases to act, I appoint BORIS NIKOLIC, as successor Executor. If 
any successor Executor fails to qualify, is unable or unwilling to serve or ceases to act, I authorize 
the last acting Executor to designate his or her successor. Such designation shall be made by 
written instrument delivered to such designated successor Executor. 
A. 
If my estate must be administered in whole or in part in any 
jurisdiction other than the state or territory of my domicile at the date of my death, and if my 
Executor is unable or unwilling to serve in such jurisdiction, then I appoint the successor Executor 
of my estate designated in Paragraph A of Article THIRD as successor Executor in such 
EFTA00027989
--- PAGE 12 ---
Last Will & Testament of Jeffrey E. Epstein 
Page 2 of 1l 
jurisdiction only, provided that he or she is able and willing to serve in such jurisdiction. If no 
Executor or successor Executor is able and willing to serve in such jurisdiction, my Executor shall 
designate a successor Executor to serve in such jurisdiction. Such designation shall be made by 
written instrument delivered to such successor Executor. 
B. 
No bond or other security shall be required of any Executor 
in any jurisdiction. 
C. 
Any Executor may resign in the manner provided for by the 
governing statutes of the state or territory having jurisdiction of the administration of my estate or 
in the absence of such statutory guidance, by filing a written notice of resignation with the Court 
having jurisdiction of the administration of my estate. Any Executor who resigns shall not be 
entided to any compensation hereunder for any services rendered as Executor prior to his or her 
resignation. 
D. 
My Executor shall not be accountable or responsible to any 
person interested in my estate for the manner in which my Executor in good faith exercises or 
declines to exercise any discretionary authority or power of my Executor. My Executor shall not be 
liable for any loss or depreciation in value occasioned by reason of any negligence, error or mistake 
of judgment in entering into any transaction, in making any sale or investment, in continuing to 
hold any property or by reason of any action or omission, whether by my Executor or any other 
fiduciary, unless my Executor has acted in bad faith. In the absence of proof by affirmative 
evidence to the contrary, each Executor shall be deemed to have acted within the scope of my 
Executor's authority, to have exercised reasonable care, diligence and prudence and to have acted 
impartially as to all interested persons. An Executor shall not be liable for the acts or defaults of 
another Executor. 
4: 
The following provisions shall apply to my estate and to my 
Executor, except as is otherwise specifically provided in this Will: 
A. 
My Executor has the entire care and custody of all assets of 
my estate. My Executor has the power to do everything my Executor in good faith deems advisable 
without necessity of any judicial authorization or approval, even though but for this power it would 
not be authorized or appropriate for fiduciaries under any statutory or other rule of law. My 
Executor shall exercise my Executor's best judgment and discretion for what my Executor believes 
to be in the best interests of the beneficiaries hereunder. Except as otherwise specifically provided 
in this Will, if two Executors are empowered to participate in the decision to exercise or not to 
exercise any fiduciary power granted by this Will or by law, such decision shall be made by such 
Executors acting unanimously. If more than two Executors arc empowered to participate in the 
decision to exercise or not exercise any fiduciary power granted by this Will or by law, a majority of 
such Executors shall be empowered to make such decision. 
B. 
Except as otherwise provided herein, my Executor shall have 
the power 
(1) 
to enter upon and take possession of the 
assets of my estate and collect the income and profits from such assets, and to invest and reinvest 
such assets in real, personal or mixed assets (including the common trust funds of a corporate

invest or loan all or any part of the assets of my estate which may, at any time, be held by my

(4) 
to buy and sell options, warrants, puts, calls 
or other rights to purchase or sell (collectively "options") relating to any security or securities, 
regardless of whether such security or securities are then held by my Executor, and whether such 
options are purchased or sold on a national securities exchange, and to exercise with respect to such 
options all powers which an individual owner thereof could exercise, including, without limitation, 
the right to allow the same to expire; 
(5)

in any other noncorporate manner, (a) to make oil, gas and mineral leases or subleases; (b) to pay 
delay rentals, lease bonuses, royalties, overriding royalties, taxes, assessments, and all other charges; 
(c) to sell, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge or otherwise hypothecate any or all of such rights and 
interests; (d) to surrender or abandon, with or without consideration, any or all of such rights and 
interests; (e) to make farm-out, pooling, and unitization agreements; (f) to make reservations or 
impose conditions on the transfer of any such rights or interests; (g) to employ the most 
advantageous business form in which properly to exploit such rights and interests, whether as

joint ventures, co-tenancies, or otherwise exploit any and all such rights and interests; (h) to 
produce, process, sell or exchange all products recovered through the exploitation of such rights 
and interests, and to enter into contracts and agreements for or in respect of the installation or 
operation of absorption, reprocessing or other processing plants; (i) to carry any or all such interests 
in the name or names of a nominee or nominees; 0) to delegate, to the extent permitted by law, any 
or all of the powers set forth herein to the operator of such property; and (k) to employ personnel,

foregoing powers, with full power to borrow and pledge in order to finance such activities; together

indirectly instrumental in the institution or prosecution of, any action, proceeding, contest,

Trustee of the Trust Agreement to pay all or any portion of the taxes which my Executor is directed 
or obligated to pay pursuant to Paragraph B of Article FIRST and this Paragraph B pursuant to a

Thanks. I'm operating on the assumption this letter, too, may someday be made public, so I think the less we say about 
specifics, the better. I would also ask tomorrow morning what exactly they need, since they may not need more than a 
high level request (and I would make the request about returning the 302 by phone only unless they push for it in 
writing). Happy to discuss though if you disagree.

IN THE WESTMINSTER MAGISTRATES' COURT BETWEEN: 
THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
-v-
JULIAN PAUL ASSANGE 
DECLARATION OF MAUREEN P. BAIRD 
I, MAUREEN P. BAIRD, hereby declare under penalty of perjury the following: 
1. From March 1989 through September 2016, I was employed by the Department of 
Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons, and served in many capacities. My last three 
positions held were; Warden, Federal Correctional Institution, (FCI) Danbury, 
Connecticut (2009-2014), Senior Executive Service (SES) Warden, Metropolitan 
Correctional Center (MCC), New York (2014-2016), and SES Warden, United States 
Penitentiary, (USP), Marion, Illinois (2016-Retired). 
2. In my capacity as Warden, at these institutions, I was responsible for the overall 
operation and entire components of each prison. I am fully knowledgeable of the 
operations policies of the Bureau of Prisons, (BOP) and very specifically familiar with 
the operations of the Communication Management Unit at USP Marion. 
3. Since my retirement from the Bureau of Prisons, I have maintained contact with many 
former colleagues. I have kept abreast of new policies and laws that directly impact the 
Bureau of Prisons. Since early 2017, I have worked as an independent prison consultant 
and have provided expert witness testimony. 
EFTA00028003
--- PAGE 2 ---
4. A copy of my resume which includes my relevant work experience has been provided to 
Counsel in this case. 
5. I was contacted by Mr. Assange's solicitors and asked to provide a declaration focused 
on topics within my expertise in response to the Declaration submitted by Dr. 
Administrator of the Psychology Services Branch of the Bureau of Prisons, 
dated August 24th 2020 and the Fourth Supplemental Declaration o 
Assistant United States Attorney, Alexandria, Virginia, dated September 3nd 2020. I was 
asked to provide my expert opinion as someone who worked many years in the same 
federal prison system as Dr 
I will provide my opinion based on my 
experience regarding conditions of confinement in the Bureau of Prisons for inmates 
assigned Special Administrative Measures (SAMs), offenders assigned to the 
Communications Management Unit (CMU), and inmates housed in 
solitary/isolation/restrictive housing units. 
6. In preparation for this declaration, in addition to the Declaration of D 
andal, 
I also reviewed previously submitted Declarations prepared by 
dated January 17'h 2020 and February 19th 2020 as well as two 
Affidavits submitted by 
Justice Advocacy Group, LLC, 
Alexandria, Virginia, the Affidavit a, 
Attorney, New York, New York 
and two Statements of 
Attorney, Washington, DC dated and 18ih October 
2019 and 18th July 2020 
7. I am advised, Mr. Assange is pending extradition to the United States for his alleged 
criminal activity charging: Conspiracy to Receive National Defense Information, 
Obtaining National Defense Information, Disclosure of National Defense Information, 
EFTA00028004
--- PAGE 3 ---
and Conspiracy to Commit Computer Intrusion. If a conviction of these charges results 
in the United States, he faces a potential lengthy sentence without the possibility of 
parole. 
Declaration talSeptember 
3rd, 2020) 
Special Administrative Measures 
8. In reviewing 
documents, he makes several references to the possibility 
of Mr. Assange being placed under Special Administrative Measures, (SAMs), 
authorized by the Attorney General and implemented by the wardens of the facility where 
the offender is housed. As the former Warden of MCC New York, which housed SAMs 
inmates pending trial in the Southern District of New York, I am very familiar with the 
restrictions which accompany a SAMs Order. I agree, in part, with the information 
provided 
specifically, his description of SAMs and the usual 
restrictions placed on an offender under SAMs. The restriction of social visits, telephone 
calls, correspondence, access to other inmates, and placement in a restrictive form of 
housing is commonplace for SAMs inmates. 
9. In the Affidavits prepared 
he provides in great detail, the effects and 
outcome of SAMs imposed on inmates. I agree with the references and the accurate 
descriptions provided by 
in his affidavits regarding the effects of SAMs on 
inmates and the conditions of confinement associated with these measures. 
10. In his Fourth Supplemental Declaration dated September 3rd 2020, 
challenges some of the assertions regarding SAMs provided by 
For anyone 
to suggest that an inmate assigned under SAMs, would be able to participate in group 
EFTA00028005
--- PAGE 4 ---
counseling is baffling to me. The main premise of assigning SAMs, is to restrict a 
person's communication and the only way to accomplish this is through isolation. For 
example 
lists a variety of programs available to inmates assigned to the 
ADX. I don't doubt all of these programs exist, but I believe they are available only to a 
select group of inmates housed at that facility. Even if the Warden, Unit Team, 
Lieutenant or Captain wanted to allow SAMs inmates to participate in certain group 
programs, they do not have the legal authority to sanction such an action. All of these 
robust programs which 
says are available, they would be meaningless and 
non-existent to
l. if he were assigned under SAMs. There may be certain 
courses/programs available to inmates assigned SAMs, but I believe all of those would be 
some type of self-study, which could be completed by an inmate, housed alone in his 
prison cell. 
11. Inmates assigned SAMs, whom I had responsibility for, were always housed alone, in the 
most restrictive housing unit, more isolated than what most individuals would deem 
solitary confinement to be. During my 18-months at MCC New York, I conducted, at a 
minimum, weekly tours of the 10-South housing unit, where SAMs inmates were 
confined. Inmates were in solitary confinement, technically, for 24-hours per day. There 
was absolutely no communication, by any means, with other inmates. The only form of 
human interaction they encountered was when correctional officers opened the viewing 
slot during their inspection rounds of the unit, when institution staff walked through the 
unit during their required weekly rounds, or when meals were delivered through the 
secure meal slot in the door. One-hour recreation was offered to inmates in this unit each 
day; however, in my experience, often times an inmate would decline this opportunity 
EFTA00028006
--- PAGE 5 ---
because it was much of the same as their current situation. The recreation area, in the 
unit, consisted of a small barren indoor cell, absent any exercise equipment. During my 
tenure at MCC New York, I had a stationary exercise bicycle placed in the designated 
recreation cell. I am uncertain if that bicycle is still in place. 
12. As with most restrictive housing units within the federal prisons, there is a limited list of 
commissary items for inmates to purchase on their designated shopping day. The 
products available for purchase are much more condensed than the commissary items 
available to inmates in a general population housing unit. Telephone calls to immediate 
family members were allowed once per month; however, as with any SAMs inmate, the 
call must be scheduled in advance and coordinated through BOP staff and agents from 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). All telephone calls must be live monitored by 
an FBI agent. Similar telephone calls, the inmate's limited social visits with immediate 
family members also required live audio monitoring by the FBI. The vast majority of 
inmates under SAMs at MCC New York, were not United States citizens, nor did their 
families reside in this Country. This made it very difficult for their families to visit and 
due to the time differences, difficult to arrange for telephone calls. 
13. There are two very differing views presented by 
anauly 
16, 
2020, Affidavit, Section 50-51), with regard to an inmate's due process rights to 
challenge SAMs. I would agree with 
stance, that application of SAMs, in a 
legal sense, affords the opportunity for inmates to challenge its implementation, but it is 
likely more of a circular argument. Inmates are required to receive notification of the 
restrictions and the basis for SAMs at the time of initial implementation and again when 
restrictions are being renewed. In his January 17, 2020, Declaration, section 99,M 
EFTA00028007
--- PAGE 6 ---
states an inmate may challenge the SAMs through the GOP's Administrative 
Remedy Program. During my 28 years with the BOP, there were times that I was 
responsible for responding to Administrative Remedies. With certainty, I declare, for the 
purpose of challenging a SAMs, it would be a futile process. The BOP exercises no 
controUjurisdiction over SAMs imposed by the Attorney General. Wardens are bound to 
abide by the SAMs imposed on an inmate. An inmate's only possibility of having his 
SAMs reconsidered, would be for him to exhaust the Administrative Remedy process, so 
he could file a motion with the Court. 
14. 
also points out in section 66, of his Fourth Supplemental Declaration, that 
inmates' First Amendment rights are not violated under SAMs. He provides the example 
that these inmates' have access to "free-flowing incoming and outgoing mail." As I 
explain in my report, all mail for inmates classified under SAMs, is carefully reviewed 
prior to ever reaching the intended recipient. Regardless of how innocuous something 
may appear, if it does not meet with the approval of the reviewer, for any reason, that 
piece of mail will be immediately rejected. 
15. 
provides in his Declaration the avenues for inmates to object to any SAMs 
renewal. He advises an inmate will meet with his unit team and the supervising law 
enforcement agency case agent, where he will be afforded the opportunity to present 
evidence and/or discuss issues and provide information indicating there is no need to 
extend SAMs, or why a modification to the restrictions are justified. The information is 
compiled by the case manager and forwarded to the Warden through the institution's 
legal department. All of this, in most cases, is an exercise in futility where a 
recommendation for continued SAMs is involved. As a former senior executive of the 
EFTA00028008
--- PAGE 7 ---
BOP, I do not know of any warden who would recommend discontinuing SAMs at the 
possible risk of serious harm to others resulting or the potential for threats to national 
security. It is not realistic and I can say with near certainty, it is not going to happen. 
16. Likewise, in other scenarios suggested bA 
as avenues of appeal available 
for an inmate, they are futile. He advises an inmate can object to his SAMs during his 
twice-yearly unit team reviews, initial classification review, and when his progress report 
is being prepared by his case manager. Having been a case manager for several years, 
early on in my BOP career, it is unrealistic to think these avenues would provide anything 
more than an outlet for an inmate under SAMs to vent his frustration. A case manager 
may listen to his concerns: however, even if the case manager believed a change in status 
was warranted, there is no possible way, that they would initiate a recommendation for 
removal of the restricted measures. This type of recommendation is far above their 
authority of a case manager or any member of an inmate's unit team. 
asserts these SAMs are imposed in, "up to one year" increments, with the 
time-requirements the same for any extension beyond one year. During my term as 
Warden at MCC New York, I have never seen an inmate have SAMs removed, only 
extended. 
states that SAMs are not imposed for punitive reasons, but rather to 
minimize a threat to national security or for other reasons not applicable in this case. By 
strict definition of SAMs, it is correct to state it is not punitive, but the effects and 
consequences of these administrative measures through my experience, are tortuous for 
the recipient, and while technically not intended, feel punitive to those who have these 
measures enforced upon them. Placement in this type of isolation, for any extended time 
EFTA00028009
--- PAGE 8 ---
period is dehumanizing. In my opinion, any person with a conscience and an ounce of 
compassion, would believe these extreme tactics utilized for any reason are cruel and 
inhuman. Humane prison conditions, in my psyche, require more than just providing 
basic necessities such as; food, clothing, shelter, medical care and safety to an inmate. 
19. In his Fourth Supplemental Declaration, in section, 67 
implies that as 
long as these basic needs are met, there is not a violation of an inmate's Eighth 
Amendment rights. As a human being, and secondly, a warden, I had to justify in my 
own mind, that this form of treatment against another, was out of necessity. I would 
rationalize for myself, that because, I did not make the decision on who was subjected to 
SAMs, I had no control over the implications and effects of these extreme measures. 
Inmates under SAMs would often ask me why they were being punished so severely. 
The majority of inmates I encountered under SAMs, were charged with an act of 
terrorism against the United States. However, regardless of the criminal charges levied 
against them, all SAMs inmates endured identical conditions. There was not a section for 
terrorists and a separate section for large-scale drug offenders. I 
is 
extradited and subjected to SAMs, he will be treated similarly to all other prisoners under 
SAMs. I have witnessed first-hand, these unduly harsh conditions experienced by 
inmates under SAMs. 
20. I know from my time at MCC New York, as Warden, even if I wanted to make 
concessions, as a way to make living conditions more humane, I was restricted from 
doing so. Small concessions, such as adding items to the commissary list for certain 
holidays, was within my purview, however; the things that were substantial and mattered, 
those things which could make a real difference, were not within my authority. 
EFTA00028010

Florence ADX 
21. In section 28, of his Fourth Supplemental Declaration,-accurately 
states 
prison designations (post-sentencing), are decided by the BOP and many factors go into 
the decision on where an offender will serve his sentence. As a former Designator for the 
BOP, I clearly understand all the factors considered when determining placement for a 
sentenced inmate. It is also my belief, asa 
states, the BOP's philosophy is 
to secure inmates in the least restrictive environment commensurate with an inmate's 
security needs. The problem with those inmates that are assigned SAMs, there are 
limited choices. If the inmate isn't gravely ill, requiring placement at a Federal Medical 
Center, regardless of the length of sentence, or any other factors, as suggested by!. 
I don't believe there are other options, except for placement at the ADX. As 
provides in his second Affidavit dated July 16, 2020, if a conviction results 
an' 
is assigned SAMs, he will very likely be housed in the Special Security 
Unit (H Unit), at the ADX facility. I would agree witlaassessment 
that if 
convicted 
could potentially spend the remainder of his life in this very 
restrictive housing unit, where he would be deprived of some very basic human needs. 
provides several exhibits which depict the desolate and degrading conditions 
associated with placement at the ADX for an inmate who has imposed SAMs. In one 
example, (Exhibit 13, Affidavit ofl
, dated July 16, 2020), 
quoted 
one former ADX Warden as stating, how the ADX Superrnax Prison is a "Fate Worse 
Than Death", that was "Not Built For Humanity". 
former Warden of the 
ADX and previous collegue of mine, was a very respected and relied upon, BOP 
Administrator. 
EFTA00028011
--- PAGE 10 ---
23. In section 45, o 
Fourth Supplemental Declaration, he states that 
inmates incarcerated in H Unit at the ADX have the opportunity to participate in a multi-
phase program, that was designed primarily for inmates under SAMs. His summary is 
absent any detail or description of what this program actually is. Based on what he 
provided, I interpreted his portrayal of the "Program," as the actual Special Security 
Housing Unit and not really a program at all. Any program involvement that would 
encompass other inmates, would not only violate the conditions of SAMs, it would defy 
the entire reasoning and intent of the assigned administrative measures. 
24. In section 102, of his first Declaration, and in sections 28-29 of his fourth Supplemental 
Declaration 
suggests not all inmates, post-conviction, who are under 
SAMs, are housed at the Administrative Maximum Security United States Penitentiary, 
(ADX), Florence, Colorado. He provides that if medically necessary, a SAMs offender 
may be housed at a federal medical facility. He further contends, most inmates subject to 
SAMs are housed at the ADX, but there may be circumstances that warrant housing 
elsewhere. As someone who spent the majority of her adult life working for the BOP and 
as a former Designator, who decided where inmates would serve their sentences, absent a 
medical requirement, or a protected Witness Security Case, I am not familiar with any 
alternative long-term options, aside from the ADX, for offenders under SAMs. Federal 
Medical Centers, in my experience, are reserved for the very ill inmates, usually those 
who have a life-threatening illness that requires on-going medical treatment not available 
at other federal prisons. These medical facilities may also have an in-patient 
psychiatric/mental health unit designed to house inmates who suffer from severe mental 
illness. 
EFTA00028012
--- PAGE 11 ---
25. In the affidavit of 
she provides a very detailed account of the experience of 
her client, Mostafa Kamel Mostafa, who is currently incarcerated at the ADX, assigned to 
H-Unit, with SAMs assigned. I reviewed her Affidavit and based on my experience with 
the BOP, especially my time spent as Warden at MCC New York, I find her descriptive 
account of what life has been like for her client, Mr. Mostafa to be believable and 
credible. 
26. I arrived to MCC New York in 2014, after being promoted to Senior Executive Service 
Warden from my former position as Warden of the FCI Danbury federal prison. I had 
not previously worked at a facility where inmates assigned SAMs were housed. I clearly 
remember Mr. Mostafa through my meetings with him during my rounds of the 10-South 
SAMs Unit. I remember he was disabled, having gone through a bilateral amputation of 
both forearms. I recall how difficult it was for him to attend to his basic hygiene needs 
and how isolation in the 10-South unit was having detrimental effects on his mental well-
being. Until recently, I did not know that Mr. Mostafa was serving a life sentence at the 
ADX and that SAMs was still in place in his case. 
27.
provides a history of the legal challenges Mr. Mostafa has experienced and 
provides a correlation to his conditions of confinement and that which would be 
experienced by Mr. Assange, if extradited and placed under SAMs by the Attorney 
General. I agree with her description of the devastating effects caused by isolation as a 
result of SAMs. Similar to everything I previously provided in this report regarding 
SAMs, she also provides in her statement. To describe the setting of the ADX and MCC 
New York for inmates assigned to prolonged SAMs as unduly harsh, is an 
understatement. In section 34 of her Affidavit,IMMprovides the findings of the 
EFTA00028013
--- PAGE 12 ---
High Court of Justice, Queen's Bench Division, specifically comments regarding the 
High Court's views on a lengthy period of incarceration at the ADX in isolation. 
28. The conditions of confinement experienced by Mr. Mostafa as outlined in detail in-
_' 
Affidavit, are the same conditions shared by other inmates who are assigned 
under SAMs. Should Mr. Assange be extradited to the United States and assigned 
SAMs, his fate will be equal to that of Mr. Mostafa. I am uncertain how the BOP has 
been able to continue with these types of isolation units, given all the studies, reports and 
findings of the horrific physical and psychological effects they have on inmates. 
29. With the Court's decision in Cunningham v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, generated by 
inmates at the ADX and further explained in great detail in 
report, some 
accommodations have been made to help negate the effects of long- term isolation on an 
inmates' emotional well-being. This decision does not contribute to the well-being of 
those offenders under SAMs. As I explained throughout my report, the very premise of 
SAMs is to prevent their contact with the outside world and especially, with other 
inmates. 
Communications Management Unit 
30. There are extensive discussions in declarations 
and 
Affidavits regarding the possibility of a Communication Management Unit (CMU) 
placement for Mr. Assange, if a conviction results in the charges against him. There are 
two federal prisons which have a CMU, the United States Penitentiary (USP) Marion, 
Illinois and the USP Terre Haute, Indiana. I was the Warden for a brief time at the 
Marion facility and was responsible for overseeing the CMU at that institution. 
EFTA00028014
--- PAGE 13 ---
an
 provide very detailed descriptions of CMUs and each 
offer their opinions about these types of prison environments. CMUs are a separate 
prison within a prison, where almost every aspect of their prison life occurs within that 
housing unit. I believe both individuals provide valid assessments of certain aspects of 
the CMUs; however, I accept 
description as more closely depicting the 
realities and accuracies of these types of restrictive housing units. CMUs are not as 
restrictive as the conditions associated with an inmate assigned under SAMs, but they are 
far more limited than what is available at a mainline institution. At the Marion prison, a 
small outdoor recreation area is available to the inmates; however, it does not remotely 
offer the same exercise or recreational accommodations found at a regular prison facility. 
There are tables set up in the outdoor recreation cages, where inmates can participate in 
board or card games. There is limited space for outdoor walking and short of walking in 
circles, or a short horizontal pattern, it is difficult for an inmate to engage in any 
meaningful and healthy outdoor exercise. 
32. Contrary tol
lassertion, inmates in CMUs are not afforded the same 
opportunities as those available to inmates in general population, to communicate with 
others, outside of the prison environment. Similar to the restrictive measures of SAMs, 
all outside communication of these inmates must be live monitored by an FBI agent. All 
telephone calls need to be scheduled in advance and an agent must be available to listen 
and record any call with an inmate's family members. This is not as easily accomplished 
as it appears. Agents are not always available on certain days or at certain times, and the 
inmate's counselor must also be available to coordinate any telephone calls. All 
EFTA00028015
--- PAGE 14 ---
incoming and outgoing mail is carefully scrutinized before delivery to the intended 
recipient. 
33.I
laccurately describes how social visiting in CMUs is limited and restrictive in 
comparison to inmates in general population at other BOP facilities. Programs within 
CMU's are also very limited and do not offer the same opportunities as those afforded to 
inmates housed in the general population of the main section of the institution. During 
my regular weekly rounds of the Marion CMU, I often had a barrage of complaints from 
these inmates pertaining to the absolute boredom they experienced and lack of 
meaningful programs in the unit. 
34. The majority of inmates I encountered in the CMU, similar to what 
depicts, 
were convicted of domestic and international terrorist crimes, violent crimes against 
others, threatening public officials and sometimes associated with anti-government 
groups. The English language was not the first language of the majority of the inmates in 
this unit, some did not speak English and Arabic was primarily the language in which 
they conversed. A large contingent of these inmates were Muslim and some would only 
associate with other inmates of the same ethnic and religious background. 
35. Both
aadescribe 
how inmates can appeal their placement in 
a CMU. As 
correctly points out, an inmate has the ability to challenge the 
CMU decision through the GOP's Administrative Remedy Program. This four-tiered, 
mainly internal, appeals process has various requirements, and is arduous and lengthy, as 
suggested by. 
It often results in a denial of whatever remedy the inmate is 
requesting. I would confidently state that it is unlikely any inmate has ever been 
successful in his appeal to be transferred out of the CMU. Inmates in the CMU receive 
EFTA00028016
--- PAGE 15 ---
bi-annual Program Reviews, which are informal, scheduled meetings where they meet 
with members of their unit team and discuss amongst other things, their continued 
placement in the CMU. As Warden, I would meet with the CMU unit team staff and 
discuss each case to determine if we believed there was a continued need for these types 
of restrictive measures. A recommendation was then forwarded from the Warden to the 
GOP's Counter-Terrorism Unit and finally to the GOP's Assistant Director of 
Correctional Programs, for a final decision. During my assignment at USP Marion, I 
recall only one time, where I made a recommendation for an inmate to be transferred out 
of the CMU, but that recommendation was met with a denial. I do not recall any inmate 
ever being transferred out of the CMU, other than a transfer to the sister-CMU at the USP 
Terre Haute. Every individual must determine for themselves, if these procedures afford 
an inmate due process or it is just a circumstance of which an inmate has no control or 
recourse. 
Declaration of Dr.M
idated August 24th 2020 
36. In her Declaration, Dr 
provides a detailed overview of mental health services 
offered in the BOP. She accurately describes the types of inmates the BOP houses and 
provides a plethora of programs offered to the inmate population through the institutions' 
Psychology Services Departments. 
37. Dr. 
criticizes the findings made by 
regarding psychologists 
staffing levels throughout the BOP. She points out the BOP was recently authorized and 
has started to recruit for 48 new psychologist positions. I believe the BOP is well-
intended on hiring additional psychologists to fill these vacancies. The problem, which 
Dr. 
does not mention, is the difficulty the BOP has in recruiting qualified 
EFTA00028017
--- PAGE 16 ---
mental health professionals. Psychologist positions have always been considered "hard 
to fill positions" in the BOP, presenting a significant challenge for the Agency. 
Psychologists in the communities are often not interested in working in a prison 
environment, the salaries offered are lower than what is offered in the private sectors, and 
many federal prisons are located in very rural areas, all making a job as a psychologist 
with the BOP, unattractive and difficult to successfully recruit. Often times, the Agency 
would offer sign-on bonuses as a means to capture the attention of prospective 
psychologists. Dr. 
believes the GOP's staffing level of psychologists is 
adequate and improving. I would only agree with Dr. 
summation, if and 
when, the BOP hires all of these new psychologists, and fills most of their current vacant 
mental health staff positions, which will likely not occur anytime soon, or ever. For 
purposes of the current staffing conditions, I find the information presented by 
is accurate and realistic. 
38. With regards to staffing levels in the BOP in general, there are opposing views between 
and 
The numbers with respect to staff to inmate ratios are 
fluid and the BOP continues in their quest to recruit qualified staff. The Agency is 
currently offering a 10% retention bonus for corrections officers at specific "hard-to-fill" 
locations. The federal prisons in Florence, Colorado, including the ADX are on this list 
with 16 other federal facilities. I
II, in section 16 of his most recent 
Supplemental Declaration refers to how all BOP staff, with the exception of a few, are 
considered law enforcement and receive identical training as correctional officers. While 
technically accurate, some of these staff have not received specific correctional officer 
training since they began their careers several years ago. In his second Affidavit, in 
EFTA00028018
--- PAGE 17 ---
section 13, 
provides a very detailed and accurate explanation of how the BOP 
handles staff shortages. The BOP utilizes this system of "Augmentation", throughout the 
country on a regular basis. In my view, the BOP is continues to operate federal prisons, 
while dangerously under-staffed. Position vacancies have been an ongoing challenge for 
many years, and I see no quick resolution to this problem. 
39. The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) (Exhibit 5 in Second Statement of • 
1, criticized the BOP's staffing levels in their July 2017 Review of the Federal 
Bureau of Prisons' Use of Restrictive Housing for Inmates with Mental Illness Report. 
The OIG report demonstrated how the BOP was understaffed in mental health services 
and not meeting the treatment needs of inmates with mental illness. The BOP's standard 
is to have one psychologist for every 500 assigned inmates. Institutions reviewed during 
OIG's inspection, fell significantly short in meeting this standard. As of October 2015, 
during a time I was still employed with the BOP, the OIG found that only 57% of its 
authorized Psychiatrist positions were filled. This Report further offers a detailed 
description regarding the psychological damage and effects long term isolation can have 
on inmates. 
40. Dr. 
and 
both refer to the 2014 report, Federal Bureau of Prisons: 
Special Housing Unit Review and Assessment. In my opinion, the findings of the report 
stand for themselves. Dr. 
implies in section 37, of her Declaration, that 
inmates are content at the ADX. She bases this assumption solely on inmates not 
wanting to transfer to another federal prison. In my years of working in the prisons, 
inmates would often express to me, they did not want to be transferred to another prison, 
as just the idea of a transfer, to an unknown destination was in itself, anxiety-provoking 
EFTA00028019
--- PAGE 18 ---
and frightening. Remaining at their current prison, regardless of the conditions 
experienced, was a better option than having to start the process over again at a prison 
which could end up being worse. 
41. A variety of programs are provided in Dr. 
Declaration, many of which I am 
familiar with, having worked in many federal prisons during my career and three 
Regional Offices. No doubt the BOP offers some viable inmate programs, including 
residential programs, especially those available to inmates with mental health concerns. 
There are specific programs designed to address Mr. Assange's diagnoses of Depression, 
Anxiety, Asperger's Syndrome and others. The problem with this, as Dr. 
also 
points out, is that some of these specialized residential programs, such as the Skills 
Program are only offered at a limited number of federal prisons. The Skills Program is 
offered at the Federal Correctional Institution, Danbury, Connecticut and the Federal 
Correctional Complex, Coleman, Florida. The security levels of these institutions are 
Low and Medium Security, respectively. Mr. Assange would not qualify for placement 
at either of these institutions, as he would likely be classified as a High Security Level 
offender, making him ineligible for placement at Danbury or Coleman. 
42. Irrespective of all of these programs available to inmates in the BOP, if a SAMs 
assignment were placed on Mr. Assange, the restrictions which accompany this, will rule 
out any possibility for him to engage in such activities and programs. The SAMs will 
override the need for programs and will dictate what is allowed for Mr. Assange during 
any period of incarceration. Safety and security will always be the primary goal of the 
Agency and all other matters are secondary. 
EFTA00028020
--- PAGE 19 ---
43. Dr. 
makes reference to the psychological assessments of two medical 
professionals who purported Mr. Assange would be an extreme high risk for suicide, if he 
were extradited. I have reviewed these assessments, and similar to the concerns 
expressed by the medical professionals, Mr. Assange's mental health and continuous 
thoughts of harming himself are very troubling. All staff receive training on how to 
respond to potentially suicidal inmates; however, we realize if a person wants to commit 
suicide or in the course of events leading up to suicide, the individual changes their mind, 
it unfortunately in most cases is too late, and the person is unable to be revived. The 
example of August 2019 suicide of Jeffrey Epstein, at the MCC New York, comes to 
mind. 
44. Suicides in prison often occur in solitary confinement and during pre-trial status. With 
the likelihood of Mr. Assange being housed in solitary confinement, he would be at 
greater risk for suicide and/or self-harm. There are cameras on the ranges of the Unit, 
but, as with the case of Jeffrey Epstein, those cameras malfunction, are not always 
operable or left unattended. 
45. If an instance occurred where Mr. Assange was in the act of committing suicide, staff in a 
restrictive housing unit cannot render immediate assistance and would need to wait until 
more staff arrive at the scene. It takes time for staff to respond to an emergency and they 
are prohibited for their own safety, from entering the cell until enough staff are present. 
The outcome would likely result in the death of death of Mr. Assange. 
46. I do agree with Dr. 
that the BOP has a robust suicide prevention program and 
employs dedicated staff to treat offenders who present with mental health concerns. If 
extradited to the United States, it is paramount that Mr. Assange's psychiatric reports 
EFTA00028021
--- PAGE 20 ---
transfer with him, (these reports are not always provided by the transferring agency). 
These reports would allow staff to be aware of his mental health history. During the 
intake screening process, upon entering any federal facility, one of the prison 
psychologists would assess him, through a series of questions, and determine Mr. 
Assange's risk of suicide. This is where the systems of safeguard have proven not to be 
effective. One of the primary tools utilized in a suicide assessment is the reliance on an 
inmate to self-report in a truthful manner how he is feeling. When inmates are dishonest 
about their suicide intentions, and they often are, (as in the case of Jeffrey Epstein), other 
cues to determine the risk of self-harm may be missed which could result in a dire 
outcome. If the assessment determines there is a present risk of taking his life, he would 
be placed on suicide watch. Individuals who are on suicide watch, remain in that status 
until the risk of suicide has significantly subsided. 
47. As a former warden, I've personally had the unfortunate experience of receiving that 
phone call, informing me of an inmate's successful suicide. In two of the cases I recall, 
although other inmates were aware of the individuals' propensity and plans for suicide, 
they failed to report it to staff. This could have made the difference between life or death 
for those inmates. Regardless of how robust the Bureau of Prisons' Suicide Prevention 
Program is, the Agency cannot prevent someone who is intent on committing suicide, and 
too often inmates slip through the cracks. 
48. Further in her Declaration, Dr. 
provides a summation of when the BOP utilizes 
restrictive housing for inmates and the reasons why an inmate would be placed in this 
type of restrictive setting. She states the obvious reasons, such as the need to curtail the 
actions of violent or aggressive inmates; however, she also infers restrictive housing is 
EFTA00028022
--- PAGE 21 ---
utilized for inmates who are deemed a security threat or for those who cannot be safely 
housed with other inmates in general population. This is a catch-all phrase that allows for 
BOP staff to place any offender in restrictive housing based on their belief of any safety 
concern. 
49. An offender, with criminal conduct similar to Mr. Assange would be placed in restrictive 
housing, regardless of any SAMs assignment, upon his arrival at every federal prison 
throughout his entire term of imprisonment. The length of time he would remain in this 
restrictive setting is impossible to predict. There have been many studies, investigations, 
reports completed on the effects of prolonged placement in isolation. I have even 
referenced an OIG report in this Declaration, which discusses this subject at length. 
From my experience, of close to three decades of working in federal prisons, I would 
agree that long term isolation can have serious negative effects on an inmate's mental 
health. There are very limited programs offered to inmates in these restrictive settings, 
including mental health programs. There may be occasional one-on-one intervention 
with a mental health professional, but often that intervention will take place by 
attempting to communicate through a steel door or the food slot built into the door. With 
the limited number of Psychology Staff, time simply does not permit any type of 
extensive individualized counseling with inmates in restrictive housing. It would take a 
minimum of two staff, and sometimes more, depending on the security and custody level 
of the inmate, to shackle the inmate, unlock his cell and escort him to another secure 
location. If psychologists were to engage in this type of counseling, they would spend 
their entire shift focusing solely on this limited group of inmates. It is not feasible to 
expect that, especially given the already high demands of their caseloads, coupled with a 
EFTA00028023
--- PAGE 22 ---
shortage of psychology staff as well as psychology staff being utilized to fill in for vacant 
correctional officers' posts. 
50. All of these policies which effect how the BOP manages and cares for mentally ill 
inmates are specific and thorough. However, policies, regardless of how meaningful and 
well-intended they are, for the reasons cited in the last paragraph, are not always carried-
out and coincide with what occurs in actual practice. 
Declaration of Truth and Continuing Duty to Court 
51. I understand that my primary duty is to the Court. I have complied with that duty and 
will continue to comply with that duty. I have set out in my statement what I understand 
from those instructing me to be the issues in respect of which my opinion as an expert is 
required. All the matters on which I have expressed an opinion are within my field of 
expertise.

Hi Mr. 
As I discussed with Ms.aver 
the summer, you would need to submit a FOIA request to the BOP and 
note that you are specifically requesting what they released to the NYT. You can send me copy of that request 
once it has been submitted to the BOP and as a courtesy I will ensure that the correct recipient in the Civil 
Division of our Office has received it. We do not handle FOIA requests in our division.

Hi 
Brief attached. Before you make the TOC, will you do a quick scroll through to confirm that (1) there's no weird spacing 
issues, and (2) the only highlighting is green? I just did that but could use someone double-checking.

Stephen Brown is working on a story about the ongoing investigation into possible co-conspirators of Jeffrey Epstein. The 
story will probably appear in Monday's editions of the News. He's seeking (but not expecting, necessarily) guidance on 
the following: 
• 
The investigation is looking into Ghislaine Maxwell and 
• 
Did massage recipients know the girls giving the massages were underage? 
• 
Re Epstein's girlfriend 
is she viewed as a victim?

• 
IN provided background, explaining that we are producing discovery in the Maxwell case. As part of that 
process, we are trying to be as thorough as possible in gathering materials about this case in order to comply with 
discovery obligations; taking a very broad approach to discovery; previously gathered boxes from Florida case. 
explained that we wanted to reach out to make sure we have everything. Want to gather copies of what 
everyone has, even if duplicative if what is already in the files 
• 
originally 
who investigated case and 
joined later on? 
• 
I estimated joining in approximately 2006 or 2007; he came down to Miami from Louisville in 2006 and started 
working on the case not too long after that 
• 
• 
asked if, has materials relating to Epstein investigation 
• I said he would have to go through his computer to check 
• 
• 
explained that we have access to Sentinel; looking for things 
may have saved to his computer, things in box 
or red weld, or anything on his phone, hard copy notes 
• I said he thought most of what he has would already be in the file but can look back through computer and old 
boxes 
• 
said that even if, found stuff that he thinks we already have, we will take a copy just to be cautious; 
• I said he thought he gave us everything last time we were in Florida (binders with victim information); said will 
do whatever we need to support us 
• 
• 
asked if there was anything that we should know about from 
participation in the investigation (whether 
helpful or harmful or exculpatory) 
• I said not that he could think of, but it's been 12 years; will think back; had good interview with 
on 
Ghislaine; as far as anything exculpatory, not that he's aware of, but will look back; have some old boxes from 
Palm Beach, will go through it 
• 
IN asked Ito hold onto materials as he gathered them and we will discuss; plan to talk next Friday at 12

The Government is also reproducing to the defendant the files specified in Defense's 
September 21, 2020 letter. In order to avoid further difficulties with respect to viewing the files, 
the Government offers the following instructions: 
I. Any .dat, .dvt, and .vol files can be opened and viewed by right-clicking on the file and 
selecting "Edit with Notepad" or a similar text-viewing program. 
2. Any video file can be opened with VLC, which has been included.

Between approximately 2002 and 2005,

massages to Epstein. The majority of these appointments took place at Epstein's Palm Beach residence. 
occasionally scheduled appointments at Epstein's New York residence.

During that same time period, Epstein typically received approximately two massages per day—usually one in the 
morning and one in the afternoon. 
was primarily responsible for scheduling those appointments in Palm 
Beach, but she occasionally scheduled them in New York.

When girls arrived for the appointments at Palm Beach, 
sometimes met them, walked them up to the 
massage room, and set up the massage table for the girls.

After at least some of the appointments, 
paid the girls in cash.

During the massage appointments with minor girls that 
scheduled, Epstein sexually abused the minor 
girls by,

Through this process, 
met dozens of underage victims, who ranged in age from 14 to 17 years old. Some 
of those victims did not have licenses, and 
arranged for a driver to pick them up. Some of those victims 
told 
they could not make certain appointment times because they had school. Epstein told 
that at 
least one of those victims was studying for the SATs.

The files look good. One thing to note is that the confidential marking is not as large and glaring as we typically use but it 
is still clearly visible in the bottom left. I think I will probably need to go through to the excels and mark them individually 
confidential but that shouldn't be too troublesome. Once 
answers my question I will ask him to export the 
productions to our discovery folder so that we can start prepping the remainder of the materials.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
United States of America, 
Ghislaine Maxwell, 
Defendant. 
USDC SONY 
DOCUMENT 
ELECTRONICALLY FILED 
DOC  
DATE FILED: 9/2/20 
20-CR-330 (AJN) 
MEMORANDUM 
OPINION AND ORDER 
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
On August 17, 2020, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell filed a sealed letter motion seeking 
an Order modifying the protective order in this case.' Specifically, she sought a Court order 
allowing her to file under seal in certain civil cases ("Civil Cases") materials ("Documents") that 
she received in discovery from the Government in this case. She also sought permission to 
I This Order will not refer to any redacted or othenvise confidential information, and as a result it will not be sealed. 
The Court will adopt the redactions to Defendant's August 17, 2020 letter motion that the Government proposed on 
August 21, 2020, and it will enter that version into the public docket. The Court's decision to adopt the 
Government's proposed redactions is guided by the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. 
Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Under this test, the Court must: (i) determine whether the 
documents in question are "judicial documents;" (ii) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to 
the materials; and (iii) balance competing considerations against the presumption of access. Id. at 119-20. "Such 
countervailing factors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency' 
and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.'" Id. at 120 (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 
1048 (2d Cir.1995) ("Amodeo II")). The Government's proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds 
that the defendant's letter motion is "relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial 
process," thereby qualifying as a "judicial document" for purposes of the first element of the Lugasch test. United 
States v. Amodeo ("Amodeo I"), 44 F.3d 141, 145 (2d Cir. 1995). Second, the Court assumes that the common law 
presumption of access attaches, thereby satisfying the second element. But in balancing competing considerations 
against the presumption of access, the Court finds that the arguments the Government has put forth—including, 
most notably, the threat that public disclosure of the redacted sections would interfere with an ongoing grand jury 
investigation—favor the Government's proposed narrowly tailored redactions. 
In light of this ruling, the parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer with respect to proposed redactions to 
the Defendant's reply letter, dated August 24, 2020 and the Defendant's August 24, 2020 letter addressing her 
proposed redactions to the Defendant's August 17, 2020 letter motion. The parties are further ORDERED to submit 
their proposed redactions no later than September 4, 2020; if the parties cannot agree on their proposed redactions, 
they shall submit a joint letter to the Court explaining the nature of their dispute.

reference, but not file, other discovery material that the Government produced in this case. For 
the reasons that follow, Defendant's requests are DENIED. 
Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16(d)(1), a Court may enter a protective order 
only after it finds that good cause exists. Within this framework, the Federal Rules of Criminal 
Procedure leave it to the discretion of the Court to determine whether modification of an existing 
protective order is warranted.2 To make that decision, the Court takes into account all relevant 
factors, including the parties' reliance on the protective order and whether the moving party has 
sufficiently substantiated a request to deviate from the status quo in the instant matter. 
On July 30, 2020, this Court entered a protective order in this case, having determined 
that good cause existed. Dkt. No. 36. The parties agreed that a protective order was warranted. 
See Dkt. No. 35 at 1 ("The parties have met and conferred, resolving nearly all the issues relating 
to the proposed protective order."). The Defendant's Proposed Protective Order included a 
provision that stated that all discovery produced by the Government "[s]hall be used by the 
Defendant or her Defense Counsel solely for purposes of the defense of this criminal action, and 
not for any civil proceeding or any purpose other than the defense of this action." Dkt. No. 29, 
Ex. A ¶ 1(a). That language was included in the Court's July 30, 2020 protective order. See Dkt. 
No. 36 ¶¶ 1(a), 10(a), 14(a). Shortly thereafter, the Government began to produce discovery. 
Upon receipt of some of the discovery, the Defendant filed the instant request, which 
seeks modification of the protective order in order to use documents produced in the criminal 
In the civil context, there is a "strong presumption against the modification of a protective order." hi re Teligent, 
Inc., 640 F.3d 53, 59 (2d Cir. 2011) (citation omitted). Courts in the Second Circuit have applied the standard for 
modification of protective orders in the civil context to the criminal context. See, e.g., United States v. Calderon, 
No. 3:15-CR-25 (JCH), 2017 WL 6453344, at *2 (D. Conn. Dec. I, 2017) (applying the civil standard for the 
modification of a protective order in a criminal case); United States v. Kerik, No. 07-CR-1027 (LAP), 2014 WL 
12710346 at *I (S.D.N.Y. July 23, 2014) (same). See also United States v. Morales, 807 F.3d 717, 723 (5th Cir. 
2015) (applying the standard for "good cause" in the civil context when evaluating whether to modify a protective 
order entered in a criminal case); United States v. Wecht, 484 F.3d 194, 211 (3rd Cir. 2007) (same).

case in other civil proceedings. She bases her request on the premise that disclosure of the 
Documents to the relevant judicial officers is allegedly necessary to ensure the fair adjudication 
of issues being litigated in those civil matters. But after fourteen single-spaced pages of heated 
rhetoric, the Defendant proffers no more than vague, speculative, and conclusory assertions as to 
why that is the case. She provides no coherent explanation of what argument she intends to 
make before those courts that requires the presentation of the materials received in discovery in 
this criminal matter under the existing terms of the protective order in this case. And she 
furnishes no substantive explanation regarding the relevance of the Documents to decisions to be 
made in those matters, let alone any explanation of why modifying the protective order in order 
to allow such disclosure is necessary to ensure the fair adjudication of those matters. In sum, the 
arguments the Defendant presents to the Court plainly fail to establish good cause. The 
Defendant's request is DENIED on this basis. 
Indeed, good cause for the requested modification of the protective order is further 
lacking because, as far as this Court can discern, the facts she is interested in conveying to the 
judicial decisionmakers in the Civil Cases are already publicly available, including in the 
Government's docketed letter on this issue. See Dkt. No. 46. In the opening paragraph of her 
reply letter dated August 24, 2020, the Defendant states that she is essentially seeking to disclose 
under seal to certain judicial officers the following factual information: 
I. Grand jury subpoenas were issued to an entity ("Recipient") after the Government 
opened a grand jury investigation into Jeffrey Epstein and his possible co-
conspirators; 
2. The Recipient concluded that it could not turn over materials responsive to the grand 
jury subpoena absent a modification of the civil protective orders in the civil cases; 
EFTA00028057
--- PAGE 4 ---
Cas6122C2-6r20213agA0ttneibebrileM9520ailleRVON01926aatijeteof 5 
3. In February 2019, the Government, ex parte and under seal, sought modification of 
those civil protective orders so as to permit compliance with the criminal grand jury 
subpoenas; 
4. In April 2019, one court ("Court-1") permitted the modification and, subsequently, 
another court ("Court-2") did not; 
5. That as a result of the modification of the civil protective order by Court-1, the 
Recipient turned over to the Government certain materials that had been covered by 
the protective order; and 
6. That the Defendant learned of this information (sealed by other courts) as a result of 
Rule 16 discovery in this criminal matter. 
With the exception of identifying the relevant judicial decision makers and specific civil 
matters, all of the information listed above is available in the public record, including in the letter 
filed on the public docket by the Government on this issue. See Dkt. No. 46. Although this 
Court remains in the dark as to why this information will be relevant to those courts, so that 
those courts can make their own determination, to the extent it would otherwise be prohibited by 
the protective order in this matter, the Court hereby permits the defendant to provide to the 
relevant courts under seal the above information, including the information identifying the 
relevant judicial decision makers and civil matters. 
In addition, the Government has indicated that "there is no impediment to counsel 
making sealed applications to Court-1 and Court-2, respectively, to unseal the relevant 
materials." Dkt. No. 46 at 3 n.5. In her reply, the Defendant asserts that she is amenable to such 
a solution if the Court agrees with the Government that doing so would not contravene the 
protective order in this case. To the extent it would otherwise be prohibited by the protective

wishes.

As we know, Epstein's Lawyers are going to claim that the NPR agreement prohibits your prosecution. I want to 
share some information with you regarding that issue. You are probably already aware of this, but I'd prefer that 
you learn about it twice instead of never being aware of this proof. At the state court plea hearing, Epstein's 
counsel told the court that the NPR covered only the So Dist Of Fla. On the next page of the transcript the Judge 
messes it up a bit, but we know that when she said "they", she meant the USAO of the So Dist of Fla, NOT the 
DOJ. I am forwarding to you the cover sheet and two relevant pages of the transcript. along with info re when 
and where his occurEd. If you have any questions about this, or any other way I can assist, 
you please call me PS - two of my clients have advised me that they have contacted the FBI.

Not really — ordinarily the defendant provides financial information to Pretrial Services when he's arrested; here, Epstein 
declined to do so and told the court he would submit financial information directly to the court. So it's not something we 
asked for in particular.

FYI. Do you mind passing this along to your contact? I don't know how much of any of this is appropriate for a FOIA 
request after the first category but am not an expert. I believe the video is in the custody of the FBI and USAO since we 
seized it from BOP. 
Thanks very much.

Hi, 
I submitted the request via the on line website of the BOP as suggested by the person I spoke to there. 
The below is what I am requesting at this time. 
i am the sole heir and next of kin of JEFFRFEY EPSTEIN, who died while in federal custody at the MCC in NYC. 
I am requesting the same information that was released to the New York Times regarding all of the information they 
requested under the FOIA regarding my brother's case. 
EFTA00028094
--- PAGE 2 ---
I would also like a copy of the video tape from the camera outside of the SHU on August 9th 2019, which would show 
the last time anybody (guards, etc) left the SHU prior to my brother being found dead in his cell the next morning. 
This is the tape that then Attorney General Barr publicly stated that he personally watched. 
I would also like a list of the inmates that were on that tier on August 9th, 2019. Also, please provide the information 
of when they were placed on that tier and when and where they were transferred to if they are not still on that tier. 
I would like any information that would reveal the identities of the people in the prison who were directing the action 
on that tier , and who was in the cell with the EMT's that came after my brother was found dead. I am trying to find 
out why normal protocol was not followed in that the body of a clearly dead person was moved prior to the medical 
examiner office being given the chance to photograph the crime scene. I would imagine that there was some sort of 
incident report filed regarding this matter and I would like that as well. 
I would appreciate it if you can get this done in a timely manner. 
Thanks,

Hi Mr. 
As I discussed with Ms 
over the summer, you would need to submit a FOIA request to the BOP and note that 
you are specifically requesting what they released to the NYT. You can send me copy of that request once it has been 
submitted to the BOP and as a courtesy I will ensure that the correct recipient in the Civil Division of our Office has 
received it. We do not handle FOIA requests in our division. 
Best,

All, 
Thanks for the call this afternoon, it was helpful to work through the mechanics of filing redactions this afternoon. As we 
discussed, we're sending you versions of the following documents, with redactions applied: (1) the Government's motion 
in limine, (2) the defendant's opposition, and (3) the Government's reply. 
Please let us know if you would like us to add any redactions to these versions, and we'll get them filed. With respect to 
Exhibits: 
• We are attaching a proposed redacted version of Government exhibit A. 
• Only defense exhibits E and G can be filed publicly without redactions. 
• All other defense exhibits to the defense opposition should be filed under seal.

Thanks very much for sending. Our team has reviewed your draft and is prepared to go forward with the call at 
12:30pm today. 
Best,

All: 
We want to give you a draft of our suggested changes (attached) before our conversation this afternoon. We realize the 
time is short before our scheduled call, so if you do not have sufficient time to review it in advance of our call, we are 
happy to push the time for our call back until after you have had a chance to review it. 
We have tried to work within the framework you provided. There are some allegations which we do not believe are 
accurate. Given the long passage of time, however, we understand that there might be different recollections about 
what occurred. We have tried to set forth both views of what occurred. We understand that you do not want a Fatico 
hearing and are willing to agree that we will not ask for a Fatico hearing to attempt to resolve the different recollections. 
With respect to the specific allegations abou•eing 
present during massages when girls were sexually assaulted, 
does not believe she was ever present during any of these incidents and believes that the girls misremember the 
circumstances. We note that these events occurred a long time ago and were emotionally charged, a circumstance 
which can cause people to have faulty memories. 
Indeed, we think that some of the evidence seems to contradict the victim's claims that 
was present when they, as 
minors, were sexually molested by Epstein. 
Specifically, based on allegations in a lawsuit, one of the victims referred to in the statement of facts states that she was 
abused on Epstein's ranch when she was a minor and that 
was present. But flight logs reflect that the first time 
that the victim was on a flight to or from the ranch where she states the abuse occurred was in April 2003, after the 
victim was 18 years old. Moreover, the victim's attorney has also stated that a photo of the victim and Epstein in which 
the victim is smiling, taken in December 2002, was taken before the victim knew that Epstein would sexually abuse her. 
This appears to contradict the victim's allegation that in the summer of 2002 she was flown to the ranch and abused by 
Epstein in the presence of =. 
To be clear, we are not asserting that this victim is lying about Epstein abusing her. Our point is simply that this occurred 
years ago and that she appears to be confused about the timing of events and who was present. 
Another victim claims that that 
walked in on an incident where the victim was performing oral sex on Epstein in 
his New York townhouse. This victim has named 
as a defendant in her civil suit and has alleged that this incident 
occurred in 2005. During this time period, 
worked out of Maxwell's home and spent little time in Epstein's 
townhouse. Staff, including =, 
were never allowed to roam the halls or go into private areas of Epstein's Manhattan 
home unless they were summoned there. 
never walked in on someone when that person was giving Epstein oral 
sex and believes that this victim must be confusing her with someone else. 
does not doubt that Epstein abused these women, as he did with almost all young women and girls he came into 
contact with, but the available evidence does not support the assertion that 
was present for or witnessed any 
EFTA00028120
--- PAGE 2 ---
sexual abuse of these victims while they were minors. Accordingly, we do not object to allowing these women telling 
their stories but we cannot agree that the allegations in their stories concerning 
are correct. 
Let us know what would work best for a call. 
Thanks,

Hi Jill, 
Following up on our conversation, I was wondering if you had any updates on the testing issue we discussed. Our team is 
planning to get tested tomorrow in order to make sure we have results before flying, but please let us know as soon as 
you can if that timing is a problem for some reason. 
In addition, my cell phone number is 
and my phone will be working while I'm traveling. I'll also be 
reachable by email.

Hi Jill, 
Thank you very much for letting us know. We want to make sure your client is as comfortable as possible. It would be very 
useful to our investigation to have more members of our team present for the interviews, but we will of course defer to 
her comfort level. Let's discuss on our call tomorrow and make a final plan for the interviews then. 
The process on our end does not require that we be tested before we depart. 
and I are asymptomatic, have never 
been symptomatic, and have not come into contact with anyone who was symptomatic or a known carrier, so we have not 
been tested. That said, if you/your client would like us to get tested before we leave the U.S., there is a clinic near our 
office that has been able to provide results within a day or two, so we could go there to get tested this week.

Hi -
I spoke to my client over the weekend. I suspect you will get rather more out of her if the number is kept to 2. I think otherwise she 
may be overwhelmed. 
As part of the process at your end will you be taking tests before leaving the US? 
Kind Regards,

Thanks very much, Jill. 
We are obtaining a waiver of the quarantine requirement from the UK government so that we will not be required to 
isolate. If your client is not comfortable with four of us attending, we will of course defer to her preference and have a 
smaller number travel to the UK. Please let us know what she prefers. 
Meeting at your office works for us, thank you. We do not yet know whether the Met Police will need to be in the 
building, but we will let you know as soon as we learn those details. 
Is there a good time on Monday or Tuesday of next week when we might schedule a call? 
Best, 
Assistant United States Attorney

Many thanks-, 
I will need to check with my client re 4 members of your party attending. Are you not having to isolate? 
I can organise meeting rooms at my office. 
I am happy to have a call next week to finalise matters. 
Could you confirm if the Met police will also need to be in the building? 
Kind regards,

Thanks, Jill. A few follow-up questions for you: 
First, we are obtaining clearance for four members of our team to travel to London. Those would be M, 
myself, FBI 
Special Agent a, 
and FBI Task Force Office 
. All four of us were on the video call with your client the 
other day, so she has seen our faces. Please let us know if she is not comfortable with that group, so that we can plan 
accordingly. 
Second, would you like to meet at your offices, or would you like us to look into other arrangements? 
Third, would you be available for a call next week in preparation for our trip? 
Best,

Hi Jill, 
Thanks very much. Let's block off those dates for now and plan to meet then, if that's okay, and we will let you know if 
for some reason those dates are not approved or if that's an issue.

Thanks for letting us know. Do you think you'll be able to let us know today about the dates we've proposed? 
Apologies for pestering, but we can't move forward with travel arrangements without them, and the process we're 
initiating requires a considerable amount of lead time before traveling once we start it.

Thanks very much, Jill. In addition, we have learned that our embassy would be required to notify the Met Police that 
we are meeting with your client. We wanted to check with you to make sure you are okay with us making that 
notification, which we are told is standard practice for interviews conducted abroad.

Hi Jill, 
With apologies for pressing, I wanted to follow up on these dates. As it turns out, we'll need proposed dates before 
we can move any further in the approval process. If you could please let us know whether these dates work for you 
as soon as you can, we'd be very grateful.

Hi Jill, 
Thanks very much for taking the time to (virtually) meet with us last week, we very much appreciated the chance to 
speak with your client. We have been working on seeking approvals for a potential meeting with your client in 
London in the coming weeks. Although we won't know whether the meeting is ultimately approved until we 
complete the process, we are working on the issue in the hopes of making this possible. 
It would be very helpful to us in the approval process to be able to propose specific dates for a meeting. We would 
suggest that we set aside three days for successive meetings, if that works. Would you and your client be available 
for meetings on October 14th, 15th, and 16th? Alternatively, we would propose the 20th, 21st, and 22nd. 
If you could please let us know your availability, we'd very much appreciate it, and we'll keep you updated when we 
have more information. 
Thanks very much,

Hi 
I rather assumed that you were not able to travel given the inherent difficulties with that and how you would be able to meet 
with people in the UK without having to self-isolate first. 
Let me know when is good for you for a video conference call. 
Kind regards

Jill, 
Thanks very much for reaching out. We would be glad to schedule a videoconference with your client to discuss her 
questions and concerns. Are there particular dates and times that would work best for you and your client? 
We are in the process of looking into the current rules on travel for government employees, and will let you know 
as soon as we have more information. Our team is willing to travel if we are permitted to, but we're not yet certain 
whether that is possible. 
Thank you,

Jill, 
We're very gratified to hear that your client is willing to speak with us, and we would be happy to answer her 
questions as best we can. 
In terms of logistics, I recently moved to a new position within our office and so the current team has been 
updated — the investigation is now being handled by 
and 
whom you've spoken with previously, as 
well as new addition 
who also has extensive experience in these types of cases—they're all copied 
here. They'll follow up with you to schedule a time for the discussion, and they can let you know the latest status 
on any anticipated approvals for Government foreign travel (which I believe currently is prohibited for us, 
otherwise we would be happy to travel to meet in person). 
Thank you very much for your continued assistance in connection with our investigation, and I expect 
and 
will be in touch shortly as well. 
thanks again,

My client would like to speak to you to discuss matters. This would be in the form of her asking how you would manage this. 
She did also ask if you were travelling to the UK at any point so. I said not but if I am wrong please do let me know.

All, 
Thanks for speaking with us yesterday. Below is the most current version of the statement of facts we have discussed. We 
want to emphasize that this is not a plea offer or a proposal, but we are passing this along since you've asked us to send 
you a draft that reflects our must recent discussions. This is not final from our perspective, and this may change following 
our conversations with victims during the conferral process. 
We recognize and respect that you will need to speak with your client this week. However, we do not want to delay 
notifying the victims, and, as we've discussed, we plan to issue a letter to the victims notifying them that we are in plea 
negotiations. That letter will need to go out this week. From our conversation, it sounds like you plan to meet with your 
client in the next few days, so let's plan to talk mid-week. 
Thanks,

may further show that any speculation about the genesis of our investigation being with SDFL is misguided). In any 
event, as we have represented to the Court, our investigation was initiated internally, and beyond that we're not 
prepared to make representations about internal communications or to otherwise characterize the investigation. With 
respect to the preservation of communications, my understanding is that the Department generally retains 
communications for some period of years, so while we don't believe there is any formal obligation to retain (or produce) 
such materials, I don't believe there would be any issue with retrieving communications should that be necessary. 
Regarding the privilege review, I expect that we will utilize a wall / taint individual or team to screen for privileged 
materials, as we do in the ordinary course where there are privilege concerns. If in addition to attorney names and law 
firms there are search terms, phrases, etc., that you want to identify for the review team, you should certainly feel free 
to do so and we can facilitate that. In the first instance I expect it will take some time to process the drives and devices 
to make their content reviewable on a web-based platform, so I don't believe anyone is yet reviewing those items (with 
the possible exception of a required preliminary screen of images for possible child pornography). In terms of the 
attorney and firm names, my thought was that it would be helpful for the case team to have them in case somehow 
some material wasn't screened, for easy recognition should we come across those names—and I've had those types of 
identifying information in other cases—but that certainly isn't a requirement if you prefer otherwise. 
Once the materials are in a position to be reviewed by a taint team, we will let you know right away to facilitate the 
easiest and most straightforward process for screening, review, and eventual production. The lag in setting that up is 
not to interpose any delay, but rather because there are intermediate technological steps before a review team will have 
access to those materials. 
I hope that's helpful, and keeps the gears turning, and please let us know if additional information would be useful. 
thanks,

Hi 
the SD Fla was ordered recused by the DOJ from criminal matters concerning Mr Epstein at a much earlier date, 
see Dkt 205-2 of the CVRA, at pg 12, fn 13 which was filed in our case as Doc 6- Exh 2 ( our bail submission of last 
week). You are correct that the ND Ga did not enter the CVRA proceedings until much later. 
I will await further communication on the communications-related request. 
I think its more consistent with a taint review - if that is indeed the search protocol that you will use or (if there is a 
challenge) attempt to use to review the seized Epstein phones/electroncs - for the attorney list to go to the taint 
prosecutor to guard against any risk that identifying an attorney may in combination with other evidence in your 
possession disclose a privilege. If there is a particular concern with the case team accessing privileged materials absent 
the list of attorneys, please let me know so we can address it without delay. We have enough legal issues... 
Thanks 
Best, Marty

Hi Marty, 
C 
In reverse order, we're not prepared to make any generalized representations regarding any communications within the 
Department in its entirety, but I note for your reference that the Southern District of Florida apparently recused itself in 
or about March 2019, and it was only at that point, to my knowledge, that the Northern District of Georgia became 
involved in the CVRA case. As we have noted, our investigation had been active for several months at that time. And we 
will further discuss your other communications-related questions and get back to you. 
Regarding the review of electronic devices, we'll discuss internally whether we're in a position to specifically describe 
our review and screening process, but certainly it would be helpful in the first instance for you to provide the list of 
attorneys and/or firms that could implicate privilege. You can simply send that list to us—unless you have concerns that 
even the identities of those attorneys and firms would disclose privileged information, though I think ideally the case 
team would benefit from having that information as further protection against any taint.

Subject: RE: Epstein Arrest Seizure Items 
Good morning 
The purpose of this email is to address two issues separate from the ongoing bail/detention hearings. 
First, the seizure of various phones and computer-type devices from Mr Epstein and his residence. I would like to discuss 
the protocol for any search of the devices with the purpose of protecting the confidentiality of a vast amount of 
attorney-client and work product privileged communications that are within these devices. Can we schedule a call? I 
have assembled a preliminary list of attorneys. If the matter has been delegated to a taint prosecutor, and without 
waiving rights to contest the process, I would like to send the list of attorneys to that taint prosecutor. 
Second, yesterday MI stated that there had been no communications with the SD Fla. That is not surprising since they 
are recused. Would you inform the defense whether there has been a similar absence of any contact with the ND Ga 
prosecutors (in particular Ms 
and/or Mr 
) or with Main Justice (eg CEOS or others)? I would also 
want to explore with you an agreement on preserving emails, texts, voicemessages, documents that would be relevant 
to the genesis of the SDNY investigation given the issues that we have raised regarding the NPA. I am not by this email 
seeking their discovery (a future issue), only an agreement on their preservation. 
Thanks

Circling back on this, I'll ask the agents to bring the cash and other personal effects seized from Mr. Epstein to the 
hearing on Thursday, unless it is important to receive them before then, in which case please let me know and I'll try to 
arrange that. With respect to the electronic devices, we've obtained a warrant to search them and so will be retaining

Hi M. Sorry to bug you while you may be working on a bail reply. 
I'm having trouble reaching Agent 
to coordinate pickup of the cellphone and other items seized upon Epstein's 
arrest. She said she'd be out in the field, but I don't hear from the intermediary agent — identity unknown — who was 
supposed to handle it in her absence. Can you step in and try to move this along? 
Thanks a lot.

All, 
Attached please find a letter, which we just filed on ECF, informing the Court that although our office generally has no 
objection to Maxwell having additional laptop access, we defer to the MDC's judgment regarding how to manage its 
inmates, including in this situation. The defense has not filed a letter in response to your request to vacate the Court's 
prior order, but I will send you a copy if and when they do. 
Relatedly, our next update regarding Maxwell's conditions of confinement is due to the Court this Friday, February 5th 
Per the attached order, we need to update Judge Nathan regarding the following topics: 
• 
Access to discovery (we have discussed this topic repeatedly, and my understanding is there are no material 
changes here, but we need to confirm) 
• 
Access to legal mail (confirming Maxwell is receiving her legal mail on the same basis as all other inmates) 
• 
Access to legal email (confirming that Maxwell has access to email with legal counsel via the BOP desktop 
computer) 
EFTA00028161

•

body scans, cell searches, and nighttime monitoring) 
Is there a time in the next couple days when we could have a quick phone call to check in on these topics, please?

Ghislaine Maxwell, Reg. No. 02579-509 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
USDC SONY 
DOCUMENT 
ELECTRONICALLY FILED 
DOC  
DATE FILED: 2/2/21 
Having considered the request 
submitted by the Bureau of Prisons 
("BOP") that the Court vacate its 
January 15, 2021 Order, Dkt. No. 117, 
as well as the Government's and the 
Defendant's responses, Dkt. Nos. 129, 
130, the Court hereby DENIES the 
BOP's request to vacate the Order. 
SO ORDERED. 
This letter is written in response to Order granted on January 15, 2021, concerning Ghislaine 
Maxwell, Reg. 02879-509., an inmate currently confined at the Metropolitan Detention Center ("MDC") in 
Brooklyn, New York. The MDC Brooklyn respectfully requests that Your Honor vacate the Order given 
MDC Brooklyn was not given the opportunity to object to defense counsel's claims, although the objection 
had been reiterated to the U.S. Attorney's Office numerous times. 
Defense counsel expressed various concerns regarding Ms. Maxwell's confinement limiting her 
access to discovery. However, Ms. Maxwell has received a significant amount of time to review her 
discovery. On November 18, 2020, the Government provided the MDC Brooklyn with a laptop for Ms. 
Maxwell to use to review discovery. Ms. Maxwell has been and will continue to be permitted to use that 
laptop to review her discovery for thirteen (13) hours per day, five (5) days per week. In addition to the 
Government laptop, she has access to the MDC Brooklyn discovery computers. Although defense counsel 
has indicated that the MDC Brooklyn discovery computers are not equipped to read all of her electronic 
discovery, the computers are capable of reviewing most of the electronic discovery. Despite defense 
counsel's claim that Ms. Maxwell's lacks sufficient time to fully review her discovery, her consistent use of 
Government laptop and MDC Brooklyn's discovery computers undercuts this claim. 
Moreover, Ms. Maxwell continues to have contact with her legal counsel five (5) days per week, three 
(3) hours per day via video-teleconference and via telephone; this is far more time than any other MDC 
inmate is allotted to communicate with their attorneys.

Just confirming receipt. Also, I'm hopeful that we can have everything gathered by April 12th. However, I'll be out of 
the office for the next week so it might be delayed. Will that be a problem? 
In addition, and just for confirmation's sake, you are ok that we will make reasonable efforts to notify the 
parents/students of the subpoena prior to compliance with the subpoena correct?

Thank you both very much for your assistance in response to our subpoenas seeking records from Interlochen. In 
reviewing the documents you produced in response to the attached subpoena, a follow-up question arose.

Would you please confirm that your production included all records of any tuition payments that Epstein (or his

Counsel, 
The FBI team on this case has been out of the office this week and will not be able to answer all of the questions you 
asked during our Wednesday call until they are back in the office next week. Please let me know if you would like to wait 
until all of those questions can be answered to schedule a day for your client to be brought to 500 Pearl Street to review 
the highly confidential images. My understanding is that the FBI is able to provide at least one laptop containing those 
highly confidential images in time for such a review to take place on Thursday 5/18, but I may not have the answers to all

That is the only excel spreadsheet indexing physical evidence that we have produced in discovery. That spreadsheet does 
not include every physical item currently in the FBI's custody related to this case. For example, the August 20, 2020 
discovery production also included search warrant returns listing the physical items seized by the FBI's New York Office 
during the 2019 searches of Jeffrey Epstein's residences in New York and the U.S Virgin Islands (see Bates range 
SDNY_GM_00166007-SDNY_GM_00166043), but they are not contained in a spreadsheet.

As a courtesy, I have asked the FBI whether it would be possible to provide us with a similar excel index reflecting the 
physical evidence seized by the FBI's New York Office, though it may take some time to compile such an index.

Counsel, 
In advance of our call tomorrow, I wanted to send a copy of the attached index of physical items in FBI custody from the 
FBI-Miami office, which we previously produced to you as part of our August 21, 2020 discovery production. Also 
included in that August 21, 2020 production were scans of numerous items listed on the index. Those scans can be found 
within Bates range SDNY_GM_00172218-SDNY_GM_00173007. It may be useful to reference some of those items during 
our conversation tomorrow, so I wanted to make sure you were aware of them. 
Best,

attaching the Excel sheet, containing defense and government objections, that contains all four lists in four different

If anything needs to be edited, I'll be around for a bit longer today but I'm unavailable later this afternoon/evening, after

Hi=, 
Thanks so much for all you're doing today, really appreciate it. Attached is a draft of the joint letter for today with the four 
categories. Could you please fill those in after you've had a chance to enter all the data from the defense? I'm fine with 
charts in each of the four questions (essentially just one row of cells with juror numbers). Also fine with bullet points. 
Whichever is easiest. 
Whenever you're at point when you have a sense of the timeline for this, that would be helpful to know — we'll need to 
send this to the defense with ample time to review for accuracy, so hoping to do that later this afternoon. 
Thanksl

Dear Counsel: 
Today the Government is producing additional materials, including Jencks Act and

case. Enclosed please find an index detailing the materials included in today's production. 
Please note that this letter, the enclosed index, and the enclosed materials are governed 
by the July 31, 2020 Protective Order in this case. In particular, the materials are designated 
as "confidential" under the Protective Order. The index is itself designated as "confidential," 
because it includes information regarding records designated as "confidential" under the 
Protective Order. The Department of Justice directed this office to cease the dissemination of 
materials marked with the word "confidential" in order to avoid potential confusion with markings 
reserved for classified documents. Accordingly, in order to note the appropriate designation of 
this production under the operative Protective Order in this case, the materials being produced 
today are marked with the following label: "SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER 
PARAGRAPHS 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, and 17." This marking directly refers to the specific paragraphs 
of the Protective Order that govern today's production.

The Honorable Alison J. Nathan

United States Courthouse

New York, New York 10007 
Re: 
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
At the November 1, 2021 pretrial conference, the Court directed the parties to file a joint 
letter regarding protections for witness identities at trial. In particular, the Court directed the 
parties to: ( I) provide nomenclature for witnesses whose identities should be protected, (2) propose 
procedures for voir dire related to witness identities, (3) submit a proposed instruction to the jury 
regarding witnesses testifying under pseudonyms or under their first name only, and (4) address 
the logistics of offering sealed or redacted exhibits containing personal identifying information. 
Below are the positions of the parties regarding these logistical considerations. Because this letter 
contains identifying information relating to victims, the Government respectfully requests that the 
Court accept the Government's proposed redactions to this letter. 
Government position: 
Nomenclature
I. 
With respect to nomenclature for witnesses whose identities should be protected at trial, 
the Government respectfully submits the following chart, which provides the true names of 
witnesses and the proposed nomenclature for those witnesses at trial. 
EFTA00028260
--- PAGE 2 ---
Page 2 
The Government submits that this nomenclature can be used when trial begins on 
November 29, 2021, but that the parties should be directed to continue referencing victims and 
witnesses on the public record according to the nomenclature in the Superseding Indictment. The 
Government further requests that the defense be directed to redact the true names of the witnesses 
in this chart from all exhibits to filings, and to avoid using the true names of victims in filings with 
the Court. Using the true names of victims delays public filings and creates otherwise unnecessary 
redaction projects that waste the Government and the Court's time. Moreover, using victim names 
in filings increases the risk that victim identities may become public, due to redaction errors or 
other issues. 
II. 
Voir Dire 
Regarding voir dire, the Government proposes that prospective jurors be handed a sheet 
with a list of names and places that may come up at trial. That sheet, which would be filed under 
seal, would contain the true names of witnesses. The sheet would not be read aloud; instead, the 
EFTA00028261
--- PAGE 3 ---
Page 3 
Government requests that the Court direct prospective jurors to read the sheet and to raise a hand 
if they are familiar with the witnesses or locations. Examination of jurors on this subject would 
then be conducted at sidebar, with the transcript redacted to remove witness identifying 
information. 
'Similarly, with respect to employment information regarding witnesses, the Government' 
',reposes that the list of names and places handed to prospective jurors should also contain a section' 
regarding entities, institutions, or programs with which jurors may be familiar. Examination oil 
'this subject would similarly be conducted at sidebar, with the transcript redacted to remove witness' 
Identifying information. 
III. 
Limiting Instruction 
The Government requests that the Court give the July an instruction that is similar to the 
instruction Judge Garaufis gave the jury in United States v. Raniere, 18 Cr. 204 (E.D.N.Y.). In 
that case, Judge Garaufis instructed the jury: 
You may have noticed during yesterday's testimony that the witness used first 
names of certain individuals. That is because the names of certain alleged victims 
are being withheld from the public and the press to protect the privacy of those 
individuals. I have therefore instructed the parties to refer to those individuals by 
their first names only; however, those full names are known to the Government, the 
defendant, and to the Court. 
An excerpt of the relevant transcript is enclosed as Exhibit A. Here, the Government proposes that 
the Court instruct the jury: 
At this trial, certain witnesses will be testifying under their first name only. Other 
witnesses will be testifying under pseudonyms — that is, under different names. 
That is because the names of certain alleged victims and related witnesses are being 
withheld from the public and the press to protect the privacy of those individuals. I 
have therefore instructed the parties to refer to those individuals by their first names 
only, or in some instances, by using a pseudonym. However, the full names of the 
witnesses are known to the Government, the defendant, and to the Court. 
The Government respectfully submits that the proposed instruction addresses any potential 
EFTA00028262
--- PAGE 4 ---
Page 4 
prejudice to the defendant, as the instruction makes clear to the jury that the identities of the 
witnesses are being protected from the public and press only, and that the true names of the 
witnesses are known to the Government, the Court, and the defendant. 
IV. 
Sealed and Redacted Exhibits 
The Government anticipates offering certain exhibits entirely under seal or with redactions 
to protect the personal identifying information of witnesses and third parties. With respect to 
logistics, the Government would propose submitting redacted versions of exhibits — along with an 
index noting which of the Government exhibits will be offered under seal — no later than November 
29, 2021. To the extent the defense takes issue with the sealing requests or the proposed redactions, 
the Court may rule on those exhibits on case-by-case basis during the trial. 
The Government has considered how best to publish sealed exhibits to the jury while 
protecting the identities of witnesses and the privacy of third parties. On that score, the 
Government is mindful that exhibits published in electronic format on screens in the courtroom 
may be seen by the public, since the screens at counsel table — and potentially the jury box— are 
visible to the public from certain angles. For this reason, the Government requests permission to 
provide jurors with individual binders containing sealed exhibits. The Government expects that 
jurors will follow the Court's instruction to only view items in the binder when the Court instructs 
jurors to do so. 
EFTA00028263
--- PAGE 5 ---
Page 5 
Defense position: 
In light of the Court's ruling on the government's motion in limine, the defense will accept 
the government's proposed nomenclature for the witnesses referenced above. The defense has no 
objection to the procedures proposed by the government for voir dire and for sealing and redacting 
exhibits on the understanding that the defense will have the opportunity to object to particular 
sealing and redaction requests. The defense also proposes the following limiting instruction in 
place of the government's proposed instruction: 
This case has received, and will continue to receive, significant attention in the 
media. To minimize the inconvenience and potential harassment of any witness, the 
Court has permitted witnesses, if they choose, to be referred to by either their first 
name or a pseudonym. However, the full names of the witnesses are known to the 
Government, the defendant, and to the Court, and were shown to you during jury 
selection. This process should not bear in any way on your evaluation of the 
evidence in this case.

regarding witnesses testifying under pseudonyms or under their first name only, and (4) address 
the logistics of offering sealed or redacted exhibits containing personal identifying information. 
Below are the positions of the parties regarding these logistical considerations. Because this letter 
contains identifying information relating to victims, the Government respectfully requests that the 
Court accept the Government's proposed redactions to this letter. 
Government position: 
Nomenclature
I. 
With respect to nomenclature for witnesses whose identities should be protected at trial, 
the Government respectfully submits the following chart, which provides the true names of 
witnesses and the proposed nomenclature for those witnesses at trial. 
EFTA00028265
--- PAGE 2 ---
Page 2 
Witness Name 
Nomenclature at Trial 
• 
• 
• 
The Government submits that this nomenclature can be used when trial begins on 
November 29, 2021, but that the parties should be directed to continue referencing victims and 
witnesses on the public record according to the nomenclature in the Superseding Indictment. The 
Government further requests that the defense be directed to redact the true names of the witnesses 
in this chart from all exhibits to filings, and to avoid using the true names of victims in filings with 
the Court. Using the true names of victims delays public filings and creates otherwise unnecessary 
redaction projects that waste the Government and the Court's time. Moreover, using victim names 
in filings increases the risk that victim identities may become public, due to redaction errors or 
other issues. 
II. 
Voir Dire 
Regarding voir dire, the Government proposes that prospective jurors be handed a sheet 
with a list of names and places that may come up at trial. That sheet, which would be filed under 
seal, would contain the true names of witnesses. The sheet would not be read aloud; instead, the 
EFTA00028266
--- PAGE 3 ---
Page 3 
Government requests that the Court direct prospective jurors to read the sheet and to raise a hand 
if they are familiar with the witnesses or locations. Examination of jurors on this subject would 
then be conducted at sidebar, with the transcript redacted to remove witness identifying 
information. 
Similarly, with respect to employment information regarding witnesses, the Government 
proposes that the list of names and places handed to prospective jurors should also contain a section 
regarding entities, institutions, or programs with which jurors may be familiar. Examination on 
this subject would similarly be conducted at sidebar, with the transcript redacted to remove witness 
identifying information. 
III. 
Limiting Instruction 
The Government requests that the Court give the jury an instruction that is similar to the 
instruction Judge Garaufis gave the jury in United States v. Raniere, 18 Cr. 204 (E.D.N.Y.). In 
that case, Judge Garaufis instructed the jury: 
You may have noticed during yesterday's testimony that the witness used first 
names of certain individuals. That is because the names of certain alleged victims 
are being withheld from the public and the press to protect the privacy of those 
individuals. I have therefore instructed the parties to refer to those individuals by 
their first names only; however, those full names are known to the Government, the 
defendant, and to the Court. 
An excerpt of the relevant transcript is enclosed as Exhibit A. Here, the Government proposes that 
the Court instruct the jury: 
At this trial, certain witnesses will be testifying under their first name only. Other 
witnesses will be testifying under pseudonyms — that is, under different names. 
That is because the names of certain alleged victims and related witnesses are being 
withheld from the public and the press to protect the privacy of those individuals. I 
have therefore instructed the parties to refer to those individuals by their first names 
only, or in some instances, by using a pseudonym. However, the full names of the 
witnesses are known to the Government, the defendant, and to the Court. 
The Government respectfully submits that the proposed instruction addresses any potential 
EFTA00028267
--- PAGE 4 ---
Page 4 
prejudice to the defendant, as the instruction makes clear to the jury that the identities of the 
witnesses are being protected from the public and press only, and that the true names of the 
witnesses are known to the Government, the Court, and the defendant. 
IV. 
Sealed and Redacted Exhibits 
The Government anticipates offering certain exhibits entirely under seal or with redactions 
to protect the personal identifying information of witnesses and third parties. With respect to 
logistics, the Government would propose submitting redacted versions of exhibits — along with an 
index noting which of the Government exhibits will be offered under seal — no later than November 
29, 2021. To the extent the defense takes issue with the sealing requests or the proposed redactions, 
the Court may rule on those exhibits on case-by-case basis during the trial. 
The Government has considered how best to publish sealed exhibits to the jury while 
protecting the identities of witnesses and the privacy of third parties. On that score, the 
Government is mindful that exhibits published in electronic format on screens in the courtroom 
may be seen by the public, since the screens at counsel table — and potentially the jury box— are 
visible to the public from certain angles. For this reason, the Government requests permission to 
provide jurors with individual binders containing sealed exhibits. The Government expects that 
jurors will follow the Court's instruction to only view items in the binder when the Court instructs 
jurors to do so. 
EFTA00028268
--- PAGE 5 ---
Page 5 
Defense position: 
In light of the Court's ruling on the government's motion in limine, the defense will accept 
the government's proposed nomenclature for the witnesses referenced above. The defense has no 
objection to the procedures proposed by the government for voir dire and for sealing and redacting 
exhibits on the understanding that the defense will have the opportunity to object to particular 
sealing and redaction requests. The defense also proposes the following limiting instruction in 
place of the government's proposed instruction: 
This case has received, and will continue to receive, significant attention in the 
media. To minimize the inconvenience and potential harassment of any witness, the 
Court has permitted witnesses, if they choose, to be referred to by either their first 
name or a pseudonym. However, the full names of the witnesses are known to the 
Government, the defendant, and to the Court, and were shown to you during jury 
selection. This process should not bear in any way on your evaluation of the 
evidence in this case. 
Respectfully submitted,

the aspects of the motion we filed, and I think it's a lot for 
the Court to have to deal with, quite frankly, and I know the 
Court is going to try and do the best it can with the 
situation, but I don't think it's tenable and -- I don't ask 
for mistrials easily, I have probably asked for four in my 
entire career, I don't see a way out of this problem. 
(Pause.) 
THE COURT: All right, I'm going to deny the 
defendant's motion for a mistrial. Any issues caused by a 
witness referring to certain individuals by their first name 
only and by asking the Government if they may use last names 
of certain other individuals can be cured by a jury 
instruction, which I will give. Going forward, the Government 
shall provide the defendant and each witness, including the 
current witness, with a list of the individuals whose identity 
should be protected from the public and the press, that way 
each witness can refer to the list rather than asking the 
Government whether a particular individual's identity is 
protected. 
You don't have a proposed jury instruction. 
MS. 
: Not yet, Your Honor. 
THE COURT: I have one. 
To the jurors: You may have noticed during 
yesterday's testimony that the witness used first names of 
certain individuals. That is because the names of certain

alleged victims are being withheld from the public and the 
press to protect the privacy of those individuals. I have 
therefore instructed the parties to refer to those individuals 
by their first names only; however, those full names are known 
to the Government, the defendant, and to the Court. 
You may also have noticed that the witness was 
asking the Government whether she should say the last names of 
certain individuals. Going forward, the witnesses will 
receive a list of the individuals whose last names are to be 
protected to which they may refer while testifying. 
Anything else you want me to put in there? 
MS. 
: Not from the Government Your Honor. 
THE COURT: You object? 
MR. AGNIFILO: I do, Judge. 
THE COURT: Your objection is noted. 
Also, I'm going to direct that the parties shall not 
make any speaking objections. If the basis for an objection 
is not apparent, the parties may request a sidebar. 
MR. AGNIFILO: Very good. Thank you, Judge. 
THE COURT: Okay, what else? 
MS. 
: Nothing else from the Government, but we 
would just ask for five minutes to make sure that the list is 
correct for the current witness. 
THE COURT: All right, we'll take a five-minute 
break.

Southern District of New York 
St. Andrew's Plaza 
New York, NY 10007 
Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
Dear Counsel: 
Pursuant to the Court's Order dated June 2, 2021 (Dkt. 297), we write to provide the 
government with the defense's disclosures under Rule 16(b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(B) of the Federal 
Rules of Criminal Procedure. 
As the government is aware, the defense is under no obligation to present a defense case 
and whether we will do so remains subject to the developments at trial. Nevertheless, in 
accordance with the Court's order, we provide below a preliminary list of documents that the 
defense may use in its case-in-chief, should we decide to present a defense case. 
We note that Rule 16(b)(1)(A) requires disclosure only of documents and other items that 
are "within the defendant's possession, custody, or control; and ... [that] the defendant intends to 
use ... in the defendant's case-in-chief at trial." Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(b)(1)(A) (emphasis added). 
Rule 16(b)(1)(A) does not require the defense to disclose, for example, potential impeachment 
evidence or documents that the defense may use to refresh a witness's recollection during the 
government's case-in-chief. See United States v. Medearis, 380 F.3d 1049, 1057 (8th Cir. 2004) 
(Rule 16(b)(1)(A) does not require disclosure of impeachment evidence); United States v. Moore, 
208 F.3d 577, 579 (7th Cir. 2000) (same); United States v. Haffield, No. 06 Cr. 550 (JS), 2009 WL 
10673619, at *1-2 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 22, 2009) (same) (citing Medearis and Moore); see also United 
States v. Gray-Bwriss, 791 F.3d 50, 57-58 & n.2 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (using documents to refresh 
recollection of government's witnesses not covered by Rule 16); United States v. King, 703 F.2d 
119, 126 n.6 (5 Cir.1983) (noting that "even though the documents were excluded from 
evidence" because of defendant's failure to make a Rule 16 disclosure, "[d]efense counsel was 
allowed to use the documents to refresh the recollection of witnesses"). 
EFTA00028274
--- PAGE 2 ---
November 8, 2021 
Page 2 
We also note the following: First, the defense continues to investigate and prepare its case 
for trial, which is still three weeks away. The defense has not made final determinations about 
which documents it may use in the defense case-in-chief, should we decide to present one. 
Indeed, those decisions will depend heavily on developments at trial. Second, the defense may 
receive documents from Rule 17 subpoenas or other document requests which the defense may 
want to use in any case-in-chief. Third, the government is still producing Rule 16 discovery, 3500 
material, and Giglio material, which may require additional investigation and may, in turn, yield 
additional documents that the defense may wish to use in any case-in-chief. 
To that end, the defense reserves its right to supplement these disclosures. The defense 
further recognizes that its disclosure obligations under Rule 16 are ongoing, and we will produce 
any additional Rule 16 materials to the government as we identify them. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 
16(c). 
Defense Rule 16 Disclosure 
Pursuant to Rule 16(b)(1)(A), below is the preliminary list of the documents that the 
defense may use should it elect to present a case-in-chief. We have attached copies of the 
documents listed below if they were not provided to the defense by the government in discovery. 
Otherwise, we provide the Bates numbers for the produced documents. Because we have already 
provided the government with the defense expert notice, which referenced articles, reports, and 
other materials they relied upon to prepare their testimony, we have not repeated that information 
here. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(b)(I)(B) & (b)(1)(C).

Just wanted you both to know that we've been receiving a positive response from NGOs on the Epstein case — not just in 
terms of the charges brought, but also in terms of the opportunity created for victims to be heard. I was in court for part 
of today, and I'm not sure that I've experienced anything like it. I am very proud of the way that our Office has handled 
this case and investigation, and I hope that it encourages more victims to come forward. 
Thank you.

This isn't an immediate issue at all, but whenever you next talk to him, would you mind asking him which victims he's 
hearing from?? We haven't gotten any feedback from individual victims or counsel (either directly or through the agents) 
so I'm just curious who else the victims would be talking to that it would get back to

One more if you can give guidance: 
We were told 
1. the representatives from SDNY also worked to debunk conspiracy theories which the victims have 
encountered online, related to Epstein's jailhouse suicide in August. 
2. prosecutors continue to battle wild speculation on how the 66-year-old Epstein died, along with rumors that 
he isn't dead at all. 
3. "The U.S. Attorneys Office wanted to put to rest some of those conspiracy theories—that he was killed, that 
he's still alive, there are people still talking about that. There are still people that think this was an absolute ruse 
and he's sitting pretty in another part of the world." 
4. Prosecutors wanted to meet with some of the victims to discuss whether or not they could be potential 
witnesses in that ongoing investigation

New York, New York 10007 
Re: 
United States v. Jeffrey  Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 (RMB) 
Dear Judge Pitman: 
The Government respectfully submits this letter in advance of the bail hearing scheduled 
for July 9, 2019, in the above-captioned case. For the reasons set forth herein, the Court should 
issue a permanent order of detention of the defendant; he cannot meet his burden of overcoming 
the presumption that there is no combination of conditions that would reasonably assure his 
continued appearance in this case or protect the safety of the community were he to be released. 
As set forth below, the charges in this case are exceptionally serious: the defendant is 
alleged to be a serial sexual predator who preyed on dozens of minor girls over a period of years, 
and he now faces a potentially massive prison sentence predicated on substantial and multifaceted 
evidence of his guilt. Moreover, in light of the strength of the Government's evidence and the 
substantial incarceratory term the defendant would face upon conviction, there is an extraordinary 
risk of flight, particularly given the defendant's exorbitant wealth; his ownership of and access to 
private planes capable of international travel; and his significant international ties. Indeed, the 
arrest of the defendant occurred when he arrived in the United States on his private jet after having 
returned from a multi-week stay abroad. 
Finally, and as detailed herein, the Government has real concerns—grounded in past 
experience with this defendant—that if allowed to remain out on bail, the defendant will attempt 
to pressure and intimidate witnesses and potential witnesses in this case, including victims and 
their families, and otherwise attempt to obstruct justice. As a result, he poses both an acute danger 
to the community, including some of its most vulnerable members, and a significant risk of flight. 
The defendant thus cannot overcome the statutory presumption that detention is appropriate in this 
case.

United States Magistrate Judge

BACKGROUND 
A. Overview 
On July 2, 2019, a federal grand jury in the Southern District of New York returned a sealed 
indictment (the "Indictment") charging the defendant with one count of sex trafficking of minors, 
in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591, and one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors, 
in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371. 
As charged by the grand jury, the facts underlying the charges in the Indictment arise from 
a years-long scheme to commit and perpetuate the sexual abuse of underage girls. In particular, 
beginning in at least 2002, the defendant enticed and recruited dozens of minor girls to engage in 
sex acts with him, for which he paid the victims hundreds of dollars in cash. 
He undertook this activity in at least two different locations, including his mansion in 
Manhattan, New York (the "New York Residence") and his estate in Palm Beach, Florida (the 
"Palm Beach Residence"). In both New York and Florida, the defendant perpetuated this abuse in 
similar ways. Victims were initially recruited to provide "massages" to the defendant, which 
would be performed nude or partially nude, would become increasingly sexual in nature, and 
would typically include one or more sex acts, including groping and direct or indirect contact with 
victims' genitals. The defendant paid his victims hundreds of dollars in cash for each separate 
encounter. 
Moreover, the defendant actively encouraged certain of his victims to recruit additional 
girls to be similarly sexually abused. He incentivized his victims to become recruiters by paying 
these victim-recruiters hundreds of dollars for each additional girl that they brought to him. In this 
fashion, the defendant created a vast network of underage victims for him to exploit, in locations 
including New York and Palm Beach. 
The defendant's victims were as young as 14 years old when he abused them. Many of his 
victims were, for various reasons, often particularly vulnerable to exploitation. The defendant 
intentionally sought out—and knew that he was abusing—minors. Indeed, in some instances, his 
victims expressly told him they were underage before or during the period in which he abused 
them. 
In creating and maintaining a network of minor victims whom he abused, the defendant 
worked with others, including employees and associates who facilitated his exploitation of minors 
by, among other things, contacting victims and scheduling their sexual encounters with the 
defendant, both in New York and in Florida. 
B. The Defendant 
Jeffrey Epstein designed, financed, and perpetrated this scheme, both as its main participant 
and through his direction of others, including certain of his employees, to further facilitate his 
rampant abuse of minor girls. 
EFTA00028298

United States Magistrate Judge

As has been widely reported, the defendant is extraordinarily wealthy, and he owns and 
maintains luxury properties and residences around the world, including in Manhattan, New York; 
Palm Beach, Florida; Stanley, New Mexico; and Paris, France. Additionally, Epstein owns a 
private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands which, as noted above, is believed to be his primary 
residence in the United States. His mansion in Manhattan alone—a multi-story townhouse 
reported to be one of the largest single residences in all of Manhattan, which previously housed a 
school and which he owns through an LLC—has been valued for tax purposes at approximately 
$77 million. Entities controlled by the defendant also own at least two private jets in active service, 
at least one of which is capable of intercontinental travel. 
As described further below, the defendant possesses three active United States passports, 
and his international connections and travels are extensive. 
For example, in addition to 
maintaining a residence in Paris, France, as described above, in the past 18 months alone, the 
defendant has traveled abroad, via private jet, either in or out of the country on approximately 
more than 20 occasions. 
In or about 2005, the defendant was investigated by local police in Palm Beach, Florida, in 
connection with allegations that he had committed similar sex offenses against minor girls. The 
investigation ultimately also involved federal authorities, namely the U.S. Attorney's Office for 
the Southern District of Florida ("SDFL") and the FBI's Miami Office and included interviews 
with victims based in the Palm Beach area, including some of the alleged victims relevant to Count 
One of the instant Indictment.' 
In fall 2007, the defendant entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the SDFL in 
connection with the conduct at issue in that investigation, which the non-prosecution agreement 
identifies as including investigations into the defendant's abuse of minor girls in the Palm Beach 
area. The Southern District of New York was not a signatory to that agreement, and the defendant 
was never charged federally.2 In June 2008, the defendant pled guilty in state court to one count 
of procuring a person under the age of 18 for prostitution, a felony, and one count of solicitation 
of prostitution, a felony. As a result, the defendant was designated as a sex offender with 
registration requirements under the national Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act. 
The non-prosecution agreement, further discussed below, was entered into at the conclusion of 
the SDFL investigation and did not purport to cover any victims outside of the State of Florida. 
As noted above, the instant Indictment expressly alleges the existence of dozens of victims who 
were abused in this District in addition to dozens of victims who were abused in Florida. 
While beyond the scope of a bail hearing, as discussed further below, it is well-established in the 
Second Circuit that absent an express provision to the contrary in the agreement, one District is 
not bound by the terms of an agreement entered into between a defendant and a U.S. Attorney's 
Office in another district. See page 6, infra.

ARGUMENT 
I. 
Applicable Law 
Under the Bail Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. §§ 3141 et seq., federal courts are empowered to 
order a defendant's detention pending trial upon a determination that the defendant is either a 
danger to the community or a risk of flight. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e) ("no condition or combination of 
conditions would reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any 
other person and the community"). 
A finding of risk of flight must be supported by a 
preponderance of the evidence. United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 5 (2d Cir. 1987); United 
States v. Chimurenga, 760 F.2d 400, 405 (2d Cir. 1985). A finding of dangerousness must be 
supported by clear and convincing evidence. United States v. Ferranti, 66 F.3d 540, 542 (2d Cir. 
1995); Chimurenga, 760 F.2d at 405. In addition, a court may also order detention if there is "a 
serious risk that the [defendant] will. . . attempt to obstruct justice, or . . . to threaten, injure, or 
intimidate, a prospective witness or juror." 18 U.S.C. § 3142(0(2)(B); see United States v. 
Friedman, 837 F.2d 48 (2d Cir. 1988). 
The Bail Reform Act lists four factors to be considered in the detention analysis: (1) the 
nature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person; 
(3) the history and characteristics of the defendant, including the person's "character . . . [and] 
financial resources"; and (4) the seriousness of the danger posed by the defendant's release. See 
U.S.C. § 3142(g). Evidentiary rules do not apply at detention hearings and the government is 
entitled to present evidence by way of proffer, among other means. See 18 U.S.C. § 3142(0(2); 
see also United States v. LaFontaine, 210 F.3d 125, 130-31 (2d Cir. 2000) (government entitled 
to proceed by proffer in detention hearings); Ferranti, 66 F.3d at 542 (same); United States v. 
Martir, 782 F.2d 1141, 1145 (2d Cir. 1986) (same). 
Where a judicial officer concludes after a hearing that "no condition or combination of 
conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any 
other person and the community, such judicial officer shall order the detention of the person before 
trial." 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(1). Additionally, where, as here, a defendant is charged with 
committing an offense involving a minor victim under 18 U.S.C. § 1591, it shall be presumed, 
subject to rebuttal, that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the 
appearance of the defendant as required and the safety of the community. 
U.S.C. 
§ 3142(e)(3)(E). 
Il. 
Discussion 
The defendant should be detained pending trial. For the reasons set forth below, it is 
difficult to overstate the risk of flight and danger to the community if the defendant is released, 
and for those reasons, the defendant cannot overcome the statutory presumption in favor of 
detention in this case.

A. The Defendant Poses an Extreme Flight Risk 
Each of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk — the nature and circumstances 
of the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant —
counsel strongly in favor of detention. 
I. The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense and the Strength of the Evidence 
The "nature and circumstances" of this offense plainly favor detention. 18 U.S.C. 
§ 3142(g)(1) (specifically enumerating "whether the offense. . . involves a minor victim" as a 
factor in bail applications). Indeed, the crime of sex trafficking of a minor is so serious that for a 
defendant charged with that offense, there is a presumption that no condition or combination of 
conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as required and the safety of the 
community. 18 U.S.C. § 3142 (e)(3)(E). Here, as specified in the Indictment, the defendant's 
conduct was committed serially, over a period of years, and affected dozens of victims. 
The seriousness of the charge is also reflected in the penalties the defendant faces, which 
include up to 45 years of incarceration for Counts One and Two of the Indictment.; As the Second 
Circuit has noted, the possibility of a severe sentence is a significant factor in assessing the risk of 
flight. See United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 7 (2d Cir. 1987); see also United States v. Cisneros, 
328 F.3d 610, 618 (10th Cir. 2003) (defendant was a flight risk because her knowledge of the 
seriousness of the charges against her gave her a strong incentive to abscond); United States v. 
Townsend, 897 F.2d 989, 995 (9th Cir. 1990) ("Facing the much graver penalties possible under the 
present indictment, the defendants have an even greater incentive to consider flight."). Here, the 
defendant is facing a statutory maximum of decades in prison. Even in the absence of means—
which, as discussed in detail below, the defendant has in abundance—this fact alone would provide 
a compelling incentive for anyone to fail to appear. It is particularly compelling for a defendant 
who is 66 years old and therefore faces the very real prospect of spending the rest of his life in 
prison if convicted. 
The likelihood of a substantial period of incarceration is buttressed by the strength of the 
evidence. As set forth in the Indictment, the evidence in this case is strong. The Indictment alleges 
that the defendant sexually abused dozens of minor victims, and the conspiracy count lists 
numerous overt acts committed in furtherance of the defendant's crimes.4
The current penalties for violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1591 include a 10 year mandatory minimum 
sentence. However, that punishment was created through an amendment to the statute in 2006. 
The penalty for a violation of Section 1591 during the period charged in the Indictment, and 
therefore relevant here, was a maximum of 40 years' imprisonment. 
With respect to the evidence in this case, the Court should start its analysis by accepting that the 
Indictment is sufficient, on its own, to establish probable cause that the defendant committed the 
crimes of sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy. Contreras, 776 F.2d at 54. ("Were an 
evidentiary hearing addressing the existence of probable cause required in every § 3142(e) case in 
which an indictment had been filed, the court would spend scarce judicial resources considering 
EFTA00028301
--- PAGE 6 ---
Honorable Henry Pitman 
United States Magistrate Judge 
July 8, 2019 
Page 6 
Multiple victims, including several specified in the Indictment, have provided information 
against the defendant. That information is detailed, credible, and corroborated, in many instances, 
by other witnesses and contemporaneous documents, records and other evidence—including, as 
further detailed below, evidence from a search of the New York Residence on the night of the 
defendant's arrest that reflects an extraordinary volume of photographs of nude and partially-nude 
young women or girls. Such corroborating evidence includes documents and other materials, such 
as contemporaneous notes, messages recovered from the defendant's residence that include names 
and contact information for certain victims, and call records that confirm the defendant and his 
agents were repeatedly in contact with various victims during the charged period. Put simply, all 
of this evidence — the voluminous and credible testimony of individuals who were sexually abused 
by the defendant as minors, each of whom are backed up by other evidence — will be devastating 
evidence of guilt at any trial in this case and weighs heavily in favor of detention. 
Finally, it bears noting that neither the age of the conduct nor the defendant's previous non-
prosecution agreement ("NPA") with a different federal district pose any impediment to his 
conviction. As an initial matter, all of the conduct is timely charged, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3283, 
which was amended in 2003 to permit the prosecution of sex offenses against minor children, and 
operates to extend the limitations period for conduct that was timely as of the date of the 
amendment, to any time during the lifetime of the minor victim. See United States v. Chief, 438 
F.3d 920, 922-25 (9th Cir. 2006) (finding that because Congress extended the statute of limitations 
for sex offenses involving minors during the time the previous statute was still running, the 
extension was permissible); United States v. Pierre-Louis, No. 16 Cr. 541 (CM), 2018 WL 
4043140, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2018) (same). 
Moreover, with respect to the NPA, that agreement, to which the Southern District of New 
York was not a party, which by its express language pertained exclusively to the SDFL 
investigation, and which did not purport to bind any other Office or District, does not preclude 
prosecution in this District for at least two reasons. First, it is well settled in the Second Circuit 
that "a plea agreement in one U.S. Attorney's office does not, unless otherwise stated, bind 
another." United States v. Frisco, 391 F. App'x 920, 921 (2d Cir. 2010) ("A plea agreement binds 
only the office of the United States Attorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it 
affirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.") (citing United States 
v. Annabi, 771 F.2d 670, 672 (2d Cir. 1985) (per curiam)). This is true even if the text of the 
agreement purports to bind "the Government." See Annabi, 771 F.2d at 672. This analysis 
similarly extends to a non-prosecution agreement. See United States v. Laskow, 688 F. Supp. 851, 
854 (E.D.N.Y. 1988) ("Defendant's argument, in effect, is that unless there is an explicit statement 
to the contrary, it is presumed that a non-prosecution agreement binds offices of the United States 
Attorney that are not parties to the agreement. This position is at odds with the law in this Circuit, 
which presumes a narrow reading of the boundaries of a plea agreement unless a defendant can 
that which a grand jury had already determined, and have less time to focus on the application of 
the presumptions and the § 3142(g) factors in deciding whether the defendant should be 
detained."). 
EFTA00028302

affirmatively establish that a more expansive interpretation was contemplated.") (citing Annabi, 
771 F.2d at 672). Second, the Indictment charges conduct not covered by the NPA, namely 
conduct that occurred in New York. As noted above, the prior NPA includes a list of several dozen 
identified victims identified in the prior investigation, all of whom were abused in the State of 
Florida, and none of whom are a part of the conduct charged in Count Two of the instant 
Indictment. 
Each of these factors—the seriousness of the allegations, the strength of the evidence, and 
the possibility of lengthy incarceration—creates an extraordinary incentive to flee. And as further 
described below, the defendant has the means and money to do so. 
2. The Characteristics of the Defendant 
The history and characteristics of the defendant also strongly support detention. The 
defendant is extraordinarily wealthy and has access to vast financial resources to fund any attempt 
to flee. Indeed, his potential avenues of flight from justice are practically limitless. 
As the defendant acknowledged in his most recent New York State sex offender 
registration, he has six residences, including two in the U.S. Virgin Islands (including his own 
private island), and one each in Palm Beach, Florida; Paris, France; New York, New York; and 
Stanley, New Mexico. The most recent estimated value of the defendant's New York City mansion 
alone is more than $77 million. The most recent tax-assessed value of the defendant's Palm Beach 
estate is more than $12 million. The defendant's primary residence is a private island in the U.S. 
Virgin Islands, a place where any sort of meaningful supervision would be all but impossible. 
Moreover, the defendant has access to innumerable means to flee. His sex registration 
documentation of "current vehicles" lists no fewer than 15 motor vehicles, including seven 
Chevrolet Suburbans, a cargo van, a Range Rover, a Mercedez-Benz sedan, a Cadillac Escalade, 
and a Hummer II. These cars are registered in various states and territories including the Virgin 
Islands, New York, Florida, and New Mexico. The defendant also has access to two private jets, 
giving him the ability to leave the country secretly and on a moment's notice and to go virtually 
anywhere he wants to travel. He is a very frequent international traveler and regularly travels to 
and from the United States by private plane. In particular, between January 1, 2018, and the 
present, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol has logged approximately more than 20 flights in which 
Epstein was traveling to or from a foreign country. Indeed, he was arrested at Teterboro Airport 
arriving on just such a private international flight after having spent approximately three weeks 
abroad. Extensive international travel of this nature further demonstrates a risk of flight. See, e.g., 
United States v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp. 2d 32, 36 (D.D.C. 2005). There can be no assurance that, 
upon release, the defendant would suddenly lack access to such means of travel. 
Finally, the defendant has no meaningful ties that would keep him in this country. The 
defendant has no known immediate family. He is not married and has no children. He has friends 
and associates worldwide, as demonstrated by his extensive international travel, and his 
professional obligations, if any, can and seemingly are plainly capable of being handled by the 
defendant remotely. Simply put, there would be no meaningful reason for the defendant to remain 
in the country, while he would have every incentive (and every resource needed) to flee. 
EFTA00028303
--- PAGE 8 ---
Honorable Henry Pitman 
United States Magistrate Judge 
July 8, 2019 
Page 8 
Nor would home confinement with electronic monitoring reasonably assure the 
defendant's presence as required. At best, home confinement with electronic monitoring would 
merely reduce his head start should he decide to flee. See United States v. Zarger, No. 00 Cr. 773, 
2000 WL 1134364, at *1 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2000) (Gleeson, J.) (rejecting defendant's application 
for bail in part because home detention with electronic monitoring "at best . . . limits a fleeing 
defendant's head start"); see also United States v. Casteneda, No. 18 Cr. 047, 2018 WL 888744, 
at *9 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 2018) (same); United States v. Anderson, 384 F.Supp.2d 32, 41 (D.D.C. 
2005) (same); United States v. Benatar, No. 02 Cr. 099, 2002 WL 31410262, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. 
Oct. 10, 2002) (same). 
Finally, there can be little doubt that the defendant is in a position to abandon millions of 
dollars in cash and property securing any potential bond and still live comfortably for the rest of 
his life. These resources, and the ease with which the defendant could flee and live outside the 
reach of law enforcement—particularly considering his vast wealth and lack of meaningful ties to 
this District—make the risk of flight exceptionally high in this case, particularly when considered 
in conjunction with the strength of the government's case and the lengthy sentence the defendant 
could receive if convicted. 
B. The Defendant Poses a Risk of Danger to the Community and of Engaging in 
Obstruction of Justice 
The release of the defendant, under any conditions, would pose a significant threat to the 
community and to the ongoing investigation. 
As described above, where there is probable cause to believe that an individual has 
committed an offense under 18 U.S.C. § 1591, it is presumed that no condition or combination of 
conditions can reasonably assure the safety of the community. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(3). Here, not 
only is the defendant charged with very serious sex crimes against minors, he has already 
previously admitted to—and been convicted of—engaging in related conduct. Specifically, in 
June 2008, the defendant pled guilty in state court to one count of procuring a person under the 
age of 18 for prostitution, a felony, and he currently is a registered sex offender, including under 
classification level three in New York—defined as presenting a "high" risk of committing another 
sex crime and harm to the community. While the conduct presently alleged does not post-date the 
2008 conviction, it nevertheless underscores the risk he poses to the community if released. 
Additionally, and in connection with the investigation of the defendant's offense in Florida, 
there were credible allegations that the defendant engaged in witness tampering, harassment, or 
other obstructive behaviors. In fact, according to publicly-filed court documents, there were 
discussions between prosecutors and the defendant's counsel about the possibility of the defendant 
pleading guilty to counts relating to "obstruction," as well as "harassment," with reference to 
U.S.C. § 1512, which criminalizes "[t]ampering with a witness, victim, or informant." For 
example, in a communication from the defendant's then-counsel to prosecutors in SDFL, his 
counsel set forth a possible factual proffer that included statements that the defendant had 
"attempted to harass both [redacted] delay and hinder their receipt of a [redacted] to attend an 
official proceeding" and that the defendant "in particular, changed travel plans and flew with both 
EFTA00028304
--- PAGE 9 ---

United States Magistrate Judge 
July 8, 2019 
Page 9 
[redacted] to the United States Virgin Islands rather than to an airport in New Jersey in order to 
attempt to delay their receipt of what Mr. Epstein expected to be a [redacted]" and "further verbally 
harassed both [redacted] in connection to this attempt to delay their voluntary receipt of process 
all in violation of 18 USC 1512(d)(1)."5 Doe v. United States, 08 Civ. 80736 (S.D. Fla.), Dkts. 
361 at 3-4, 361-7 through 361-11. In addition to 18 U.S.C. § 1512(d), prosecutors also proposed 
that the defendant could plead guilty to 18 U.S.C. § 403, that is, a knowing or intentional violation 
of the privacy protection of child victims and child witnesses, to which the defendant's counsel 
replied: "Already thinking about the same statutes." Id. Dkt. 361-11. They also discussed a 
possible obstruction plea that "could rely on the incident where Mr. Epstein's private investigators 
followed [redacted] father, forcing off the road." Id. Dkt. 361-10. 
The defendant's apparent previous willingness to obstruct a federal investigation, harass or 
tamper with witnesses, and hire private investigators that "forc[ed] off the road" the father of an 
individual relevant in the investigation is alarming. It should especially weigh on the Court's 
consideration here because the defendant was apparently willing to take those steps before even 
being charged and thus facing federal indictment; the incentive to interfere in the Government's 
case here, where an Indictment has been returned, is exponentially greater. And as discussed 
above, the defendant has nearly limitless means to do so. 
Finally, despite having been previously convicted of a sex offense involving an underage 
victim, the defendant has continued to maintain a vast trove of lewd photographs of young-looking 
women or girls in his Manhattan mansion. In a search of the New York Residence on the night of 
his arrest, on July 6-7, 2019, pursuant to judicially-authorized warrants, law enforcement officers 
discovered not only specific evidence consistent with victim recollections of the inside of the 
mansion, further strengthening the evidence of the conduct in the charged Indictment, but also at 
least hundreds—and perhaps thousands-of sexually suggestive photographs of fully- or partially-
nude females. While these items were only seized this weekend and are still being reviewed, some 
of the nude or partially-nude photographs appear to be of underage girls, including at least one girl 
whose counsel has informed the Government was underage at the time the relevant photographs 
were taken. Additionally, some of the photographs referenced herein were discovered in a locked 
safe, in which law enforcement officers also found compact discs with hand-written labels 
including the following: "Young [Name] + [Name]," "Misc nudes 1," and "Girl pics nude." The 
defendant, a registered sex offender, is not reformed, he is not chastened, he is not repentant;6
rather, he is a continuing danger to the community and an individual who faces devastating 
evidence supporting deeply serious charges. 
The redactions above are contained in the publicly filed version of the quoted document. 
See, e.g., Amber Southerland, Billionaire Jeffrey Epstein: I'm a sex offender, not a predator, 
N.Y. Post (2011) ("I'm not a sexual predator, I'm an "offender," the financier told The Post 
yesterday. `It's the difference between a murderer and a person who steals a bagel.'"); Philip 
Weiss, The Fantasist, New York Magazine (2007) ("`It's the Icarus story, someone who flies too 
close to the sun,' I said. `Did Icarus like massages?' Epstein asked.").

CONCLUSION 
As set forth above, in this case, the risk of flight in this case is extraordinarily real. The 
defendant is extremely wealthy, has extensive foreign contacts, and is charged with serious 
offenses that carry a potential statutory sentence of up to 45 years' imprisonment—even a fraction 
of which could result in the defendant, who is 66 years old, spending the rest of his life in jail. In 
sum, the defendant's transient lifestyle, his lack of family or community ties, his extensive 
international travel and ties outside the country, and his vast wealth, including his access to and 
ownership of private planes, all provide the defendant with the motive and means to become a 
successful fugitive. Further, the nature of the offenses he is alleged to have perpetrated—the abuse 
dozens of underage, vulnerable girls—along with his demonstrated willingness to harass, 
intimidate and otherwise tamper with victims and other potential witnesses against him, render his 
dangerousness readily apparent. 
As such, the Government respectfully submits that the defendant cannot and will not be 
able to meet his burden of overcoming the strong presumption in favor of detention, that there are 
no conditions of bail that would assure the defendant's presence in court proceedings in this case 
or protect the safety of the community, and that any application for bail should be denied.

1-800-CALL FBI 
July 8, 2019 
Investigators seized nude photographs of underage girls from the Manhattan townhouse of Jeffrey Epstein 
as part of a new investigation into allegations he exploited dozens of minors for sex, prosecutors revealed 
on Monday. 
That detail was mentioned by federal prosecutors on Monday as they unsealed an indictment charging Mr. 
Epstein with sex trafficking and made an appeal to other women who may have been abused by him to 
come forward. 
"They deserve their day in court and we are proud to stand up for them by bringing this indictment," the 
United States attorney in Manhattan, Geoffrey S. Berman, said. 
Mr. Epstein, 66, is accused of engaging in sex acts with dozens of vulnerable minors, some as young as 14, 
during naked massage sessions, then paying them hundreds of dollars in cash. He also asked some of the 
girls to recruit other underage girls, the indictment said. 
"In this way, Epstein created a vast network of underage victims for him to sexually exploit in locations 
including New York and Palm Beach," the indictment said. 
Mr. Berman's decision to seek an indictment in Manhattan was an implicit rebuke to the decision by 
prosecutors in Miami in 2008 to enter an agreement with Mr. Epstein that allowed him to avoid federal 
prosecution and a possible life sentence. 
Under that deal, Mr. Epstein pleaded guilty to state prostitution charges and spent about a year in a Palm 
Beach jail. He was permitted to leave the facility six days a week to work. 
Mr. Berman made it clear his office was not bound by the agreement, which was overseen by Alexander 
Acosta, then the United States attorney in Miami who is now President Trump's secretary of labor. 
"That agreement, by its terms, only binds the Southern District of Florida," Mr. Berman said. 
The agreement has been examined in a series of reports in The Miami Herald and is being challenged in 
court. A federal judge ruled earlier this year Mr. Epstein's accusers should have been consulted about the 
deal before it was signed. 
The indictment unsealed in Manhattan on Monday said that from 2002 to 2005 Mr. Epstein and his 
employees engaged in a sex trafficking scheme, bringing underage girls to his Upper East Side mansion 
and his palatial compound in Palm Beach, Fla., to engage in sex acts with him. 
The indictment said Mr. Epstein used employees and assistants to arrange sexual rendezvous with at least 
one girl at his New York residence and two at his home in Palm Beach. 
EFTA00028309
--- PAGE 3 ---
Mr. Epstein is accused of having the girls perform nude massages, at which point he would masturbate and 
touch their genitals with his hands or with sex toys. 
The girls were paid hundreds of dollars in cash for each encounter and, once recruited, were asked to 
return to the mansion several times, where they were abused again, the indictment said. Mr. Epstein, the 
court documents read, "created a similar network of minor girls to victimize" in Florida. 
"This conduct, as alleged, went on for years and involved dozens of young girls, some as young as 14," 
Mr. Berman said. "The alleged behavior shocks the conscience." 
[Read the indictment.] 
The charges unsealed Monday by the Southern District of New York signal a prosecution that some of his 
accusers have been awaiting for years. 
Accusations of pedophilia and sexual predation have dogged Mr. Epstein for decades. And now, in the 
#MeToo era, his case has been held up as a prime example of insulated, powerful men avoiding 
accountability. 
For more than a decade, Mr. Epstein, a hedge fund manager, avoided a lengthy prison sentence, largely 
because of the agreement his lawyers struck with federal prosecutors in 2008. 
Mr. Epstein's social circle is filled with other high-profile connections, including to former President Bill Clinton, Prince 
Andrew of Britain and a host of others. 
In 2002, Mr. Trump described Mr. Epstein as "a terrific guy." 
"He's a lot of fun to be with," Mr. Trump told New York Magazine. "It is even said that he likes beautiful 
women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side." 
On Saturday, F.B.I. agents and New York Police Department officers used a crow bar to force open the wooden doors of 
Mr. Epstein's East 71st Street mansion. 
EFTA00028310
--- PAGE 4 ---
The charges unsealed Monday mirror those that federal prosecutors had prepared in Miami against Mr. 
Epstein more than a decade ago. In 2005, law enforcement officials there investigated Mr. Epstein after the 
parents of one of his accusers reported an incident to the police. 
As first reported in The Miami Herald last year, prosecutors had prepared a 53-page indictment accusing 
Mr. Epstein of being a sexual predator. But those charges were shelved in 2008 after an eleventh-hour deal 
was reached between the United States attorney's office in Miami and Mr. Epstein's lawyers. 
The plea agreement granted Mr. Epstein immunity from federal prosecution and let him plead guilty to two 
prostitution charges in state court. Federal prosecutors arranged for the plea deal to be kept secret from Mr. 
Epstein's accusers until it was finalized in court. 
In April, a federal judge ruled that prosecutors had violated the law in offering the plea agreement without 
informing Mr. Epstein's accusers. The Justice Department also opened a probe into the incident in 
February.

Hi 
and 
I am sure you are already looking at this but there is a real mystery as to how this guy acquired his wealth and its 
possible relationship with the charges thus far in the indictment. I already see significant tax evasion at the local 
and state level with the way in which the mansion was transferred to him back in 1996 (no record, no transfer 
taxes paid) as well as claiming the VI as his supposed primary residence. It would not surprise me that there is 
significant tax evasion at the federal level along with underlying criminality involved in the acquisition of the 
wealth in the first place. 
Good luck with everything. 
Best, 
Rich

A quick update on the Mark Epstein threats, in case this affects anyone. For those not previously involved with this, a 
fraudster in Iran has been tormenting Mark Epstein by email and text, pretending to be about 15 different people using 
fake email addresses and some spoofing. These personalities are variously offering to sell (Mark) Epstein money about 
his brother's "murder," extorting him for money by threatening to kill his kids, etc. The principal unifying thread is an 
attempt to get Epstein to send "them" $25K in bitcoin. Despite the now-obvious fact that the source is a fraud (which 
Epstein's attorney knows and has repeatedly told him), Epstein keeps emailing with him, which only eggs the guy on. 
I'm writing now just to advise you that the latest threat is to provide media outlets information that Mark Epstein was 
involved in his brother's sex crimes. This too is almost certainly a bluff. Nonetheless, in case the perpetrator actually 
does try to pass something off to the media, I wanted to give everyone a heads up where it was coming from. If you 
want more information, let me know. 
Thanks,

Attachments: QTRLY_SHU_Slides-_PSYC_ONLY.pptx 
Attached is the most recently updated Suicide Prevention slide show the Chief Psychologist uses during SHU training. It is 
dated 6/11/13. This is the slide show that is still being used during quarterly SHU training. 
I will continue to send additional docs as I obtain them. 
»'

Thank you very much for this extremely clear and helpful email. Just a few follow-up points: 
For the "Hot List" (or the high risk list), it is dated August 30, 2019, which is after the events in question. Do you 
have these from the period of June 26, 2019 through August 10, 2019? 
You are still working on getting us the following: 
o Finalized versions of Program Statements 5511.08 and 5500.13; 
o An updated suicide prevention PowerPoint presentation; and 
o Watch call tracking sheets 
Finally, with respect to our request for all SROs during the time of 
assignment to the SHU, that seems 
excessively burdensome. Rather, if possible, can you locate the SROs related to Epstein only? 
o Is there something called a "SHU report" that is different from an SRO?

Subject: Re: FW: Requests 
All, 
I hope my responses below serve to clear up some of the issues you had with the documentation that was provided. I 
continue to work to obtain the missing items and will send them as I receive any additional documents. Please let me know 
if you have further questions and I'll be happy to address anything that is still unclear. 
Many of the requests made, such as ICT agenda, cellmate policies and SHU policies are not one-stop-shops. 
These issues are covered in a number of different policies, therefore I tried to include all policies that 
reference those topics. 
1. We received unsigned Word versions of Program Statements 5511.08 and 5500.13. Are there finalized versions? 
Executive Assistant Lee Plourde handles the finalizing of the supplements. He's on leave and will 
address this upon his return on Monday, June 29, 2020. 
2. Why were we given the BOP Correctional Services Procedures Manual? Which of our requests is this responsive to? 
Section 310 of this policy covers inmate accountability in the SHU. You requested 5511.08 and this 
section in the CSPM overlaps some of those same policies. 
EFTA00028324
--- PAGE 2 ---
3. Why were we given the BOP Suicide Prevention Program Statement? Which of our requests is this responsive to? 
This policy covers staff training requirements for ICT and Quarterly SHU training. I included the 
policy because it directly correlated with other requests. 
4. We were also given a Powerpoint entitled Suicide Prevention for Inmates. Which of our requests is this responsive 
to? When is this document from? The slide show is the Psychology portion of the SHU Training you 
requested. It is dated 1/2 2014. I have requested an updated version that would have been used 
more closely to the time o 
ignment to SHU. I'm just waiting for Psychology staff to 
provide me whatever it is they used at that time. 
5. We were provided a document titled Introduction to Correctional Techniques from January 2020. Which of our 
requests is this responsive to? Is it the MCC institutional familiarization training outline? If so, we would request 
one from a time when the defendants were actively employed at MCC (so before August 2019). This is the 
Institutional Familiarization (IF) outline you requested. It hasn't been called IF for a few years. It is 
now Introduction to Correctional Techniques (ICT). An earlier version is attached here. 
6. We were provided with an undated slide presentation about the MCC SHU. Which of our requests is this responsive 
to? When is this document from? The slide show was created 1/2/2014 as a part of quarterly SHU 
training. The quarterly SHU training is primarily conducted through the BOP's online training 
platform that is a self-guided course that covers a number of topics related to SHU. The official SHU 
training course is not something I can send or save due to the nature of the course being automated 
by the training platform and not a hard file. 
7. The BOP Code of Ethics is highlighted below. Which document is this? Program Statement 3420.11 is the 
Standards of Employee Conduct, which covers the dos and don'ts of employment in the BOP. I've 
attached the DO] Ethics Handbook here. If there is something specific you're looking for, please let 
me know. 
8. We received digital lieutenant's logs. Is there also a hard copy book? There is no hard copy book of these 
logs. The logs are saved to a shared folder at the end of each shift. Although I have worked at 
places that print each log, the Lieutenant's here at NYM reported that that is not the practice here. 
The LTs here email their logs to the executive staff at the conclusion of each 24 hour period for 
review purposes. Thus, eliminating a hard copy record system. 
9. We were provided with a document called "SHU Logs MW" and a document called "SHU Logs." Can we confirm 
what these are? Our requests were for SHU Watch Call Logs and SHU Control Center Logs. Those are the 
digital log books from SHU for the Evening and Morning Watch shifts during the requested time 
period. I am working on obtaining the actual Watch Call tracking sheets from the main Control 
Center at MCC which is something different. However, the officer should be logging their watch calls 
into the digital log book every 30 minutes between 6a — 6p each day. 
10. Which document contains the BOP and MCC policy on SHU quarterly training, which is highlighted below as having 
been provided? PS 5270.11 as well as the Suicide Prevention policy covers the SHU quarterly training 
requirement. There is not a separate policy for that. 
11. We asked for P.S. 5270.10, but got P.S. 5270.11. Was P.S. 5270.10 provided to us in error? Or was our request 
incorrect? 5270.10 does not exist. 5270.11 is the policy covering SHU. 
12. Which document contains the BOP and MCC policy on cellmates? I am not aware of any such policy and have 
struggled to find even a mention of it in the policies I've reviewed. I will continue to search for a 
policy that references cellmate assignments. 
13. In the second email, there is a document called "Hot Lists" dated August 30, 2019. Which of our requests is this 
responsive to? The "Hot List" is the high risk list. Any inmate on that list who goes to SHU requires 
immediate notification to Psychology. This is the only "high risk" list the BOP has and I provided it in 
response to your rest 
for "All High Risk Lists reviewed during weekly SHU meetings..." 
14. In the second email, 
mentioned that most of the control center paperwork was seized by FBI and/or 01G. 
Do you or FBI have that paperwork? Has it been provided to us? 
15. Finally, what is the status of the remaining requests? As I continue to work from home, I have not 
personally been able to physically search for the Watch Call sheets. As I previously mentioned, 
those logs were reportedly seized early on in this investigation. I continue to follow up on this. With 
regard to the SROs, those reviews are only electronically available for inmates who are currently in 
SHU and only for the period of their most recent admission to SHU. SROs, assuming they were 
completed, would then be printed and filed in the inmate's central file. I am currently trying to 
figure out where Epstein's file is to see if any SROs are in it. If you really want ALL SROs for the 
period of 
assignment to SHU, that will be an extremely lengthy process of tracking down 
inmate files, many of whom have released from the BOP or been transferred to any number of 
institutions across the country, and then requesting any SROs from the specified period of time that 
are contained in those files be scanned to us. I'm guessing Epstein's file was taken along with all of 
the other documentation shortly after his death, but I have not confirmed that yet.

I am a retired Police Detective with over 25 years service in the investigation into child abuse. 
for exposing the high-level cover-up of child prostitution. For the past eight years, I have been working with anti-child abuse campaigner 
Bill Maloney in raising awareness of the true extent of the scale of this heinous crime. I, now with other whistleblowing cops as well as 
victims and survivors of abuse, am campaigning for a change in the Law to give brave whistleblowers the protection they truly deserve. In 
the words of Edmund Burke: 'All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing? 
Since I stood up and exposed the vile crimes against children (which were suppressed for decades). I faced a sustained and aggressive 
onslaught designed not just to silence me but to ultimately destroy me. 
I was threatened and bullied out of my job 
This attack strengthened my resolve, and I embarked on a journey where I have met brave. kind. compassionate individuals comprised of 
fellow whistleblowers. victims, and survivors of abuse. If whistleblowers do not receive adequate, independent, and secure protection then 
the horrific abuse of society's most vulnerable and precious members will continue. 
I graciously and respectfully ask that you back my campaign. Thank you to everyone who have already generously donated. Please 
continue supporting justice by donating to our ongoing cause.

I don't think we ordinarily engage on that type of question, but given that we have been in touch with you in connection

Unfortunately I don't think this is very helpful to us. Did you take a look at the example spreadsheet I sent on 2/24? The 
excel file you sent has descriptions that don't match up to the items listed in the search warrant returns (that we sent on 
2/23), and we don't have the 1B or CART numbers to be able to cross-reference. We also can't tell what you mean by 
"loose media" without a specific comparison to what was seized, we don't know which items you're referring to as 
"Windows machines," and we can't tell whether the entirety of any particular item has been transferred, or just partial. 
For example, it looks like we have gotten very, very few image files, which is surprising. 
We have also encountered some very significant problems in trying to review the more than 1 million documents we 
recently received: 
The data we've received has no way to put any emails and attachments together. So if an email says, "see the 
attached flight records," for example, we have no way of linking that up with the records themselves. Not only is 
that a big problem for us in review, it's going to be a huge problem for producing the documents to defense 
counsel. 
The load file has no link to the native file, so when we load the data to the database, there's no way to have the 
native files show up in the database. Because many of the files are too large to open in the viewer, it effectively 
means that there are many files that are completely invisible to us. 
Related, the control numbers in the load file don't match up to the native files. So we have two sets of numbers 
and no way to match up anything—that is, even if we were to try to go hunt down every individual large file in the 
native files, it would be impossible. 
So the data that we most recently got, we need to get in a form that addresses those issues, and we likely will need to get 
a similar reproduction of the data we received a couple months ago. Otherwise we're sifting through more than a million 
documents without much rhyme or reason. 
I've re-attached the spreadsheet we sent last week — I think that's a good place to start in terms of our necessary record-
keeping, and we need that info at the very least, as well as anything else you think would be useful. Also attaching the SW 
returns for reference. And again, we're happy to meet up anytime and hash all this out in person if that's useful.

Here is a listing of what I have already handed over in load files to the US Attorney's Office for taint review. Some points of 
clarification: There were 9 IDE hard drives found in the Manhattan apartment, they turned out to be 3 copies of 3 drives 
(9 drives in total) from a July 2007 search on one of his properties. I only processed 3 (as they were all copies). All the 
loose media from the NY apartment is included. All the Windows machines from the NY apartment are included. Only 2 
Macs from NY and 1 from the Island are included.

I will have to more closely coordinate with whoever is loading up Relativity with the remaining Macs as the tool

Totally understand about the network issues—we can relate. I do still think it will be helpful to all sit down together to 
have an in-person discussion, to make sure everybody is on the same page. Are folks available for that next week? And 
what I think would be most helpful to facilitate that would be a spreadsheet of each separate device referenced in the two 
search warrant returns, with columns for whether we've dumped the contents, whether they've been reviewed and/or 
transferred, what portions were transferred, etc. 
Something roughly like the attached, with any other categories you think would be useful — and the info on the attached is 
mostly hypothetical, obviously, just as examples. That will help us fully understand what's been reviewed, transferred, 
and received so far, and what remains. 
(Also just on the pictures, we do want copies of those as well, please including from the discs and the devices — I think FBI 
was going to do an initial screen to make sure no CP, and since I think the answer was no, we'll need to get those to be 
able to review them as well.)

Sony for the delayed response. They are tearing out our old network and giving us a new one, they mandated we 
delete old stuff (about 400 TB worth). Now that they are working on replacing the network, we can do only local 
work. I should be able to give you an accounting of what is what. I can say, off the top of my head, that all 
windows based items from the NY search have been handed over as well as all loose media. The CDs from NY 
only contained pictures, no documents. There are still some Apple items from NY that need to be produced. As 
far as the Island stuff goes, the 1st item on your spreadsheet, the "kitchen" mac has been produced. Still working 
on the rest.

Following up on the below from last weekend, I'm still not sure how we're addressing this so I thought it would make 
sense for us to all schedule a (hopefully relatively brief) meeting to all get on the same page? We didn't hear back on 
which files had previously been provided, but our tech folks did their best to differentiate, and we got access to the 
materials yesterday and its well over a million documents, and we don't have any idea what we're looking at — i.e., which 
devices the materials came from, whether it's full or partial results, how many more devices we have coming, etc. 
EFTA00028343
--- PAGE 6 ---
Based on the attached search warrant returns, it looks like from the New York mansion (the PDF) there are approximately 
devices that would have storage (computers, hard drives, thumb drives, etc.) and that's not even counting at least 60+ 
CDs. And then from the Virgin Islands (the Excel spreadsheet), at least more than 25 devices, including multiple servers / 
server racks. 
So we gotta know what we've already received, what remains, anticipated schedule, etc, and I know it's a lot of moving 
pieces on all sides so wanted to loop in everybody at once. The case team will be in California this coming week from 
Tuesday through Friday, but then I think generally around the first week of March, which will hopefully be plenty of time 
to schedule a productive meeting.

I'm not sure who's the exact right person to ask this, so wanted to get everybody on one email chain about it — I have the 
hard drive that 
dropped off that has new Epstein search warrant materials, but it looks like there are also old 
materials (that I think we had previously received and uploaded??) on the hard drive, and so I'm not sure what's new. 
Just generally, and 
and I talked about this last week too, but it's basically impossible for us to keep track of what 
we're getting, and what has been completed, without some kind of identification or labeling system, along with a list of 
which devices have been extracted and downloaded. 
So for example on the hard drive currently, there are 38 folders labeled "loadFiles" through "37loadFiles" with a modified 
date of 11/14/19, which I think we may have already previously received — but I'm not sure, because we haven't gotten 
any info on which folders match up to which devices, etc. And then there's another folder titled "NYC024362" that has a 
modified date of 1/27/20, so I think that may be the materials we hadn't previously received? That folder by itself has 
more than 600,000 items. 
I don't want to give 
anything that we've already previously received and uploaded, and I can't tell from the folder or 
file names whether everything on the drive is new, or whether just additional materials were saved onto it in addition to 
what we already have. =, 
are you able to give us some guidance on this? Ultimately what we really need is a 
spreadsheet of every device, whether it's been dumped (or partially dumped), and then identifying that same info —
which device, and what materials from it — are being given to us with each data transfer. Otherwise I think 
organizationally and for review purposes it will be a total disaster for us. 
We're happy to have a meeting on this if that's helpful — and thanks everybody for the assistance.

Sid, 
As you may already know, pursuant to the Crime Victims' Rights Act, specifically 18 U.S.C. 3771(a)(4), a crime victim has 
the right to be reasonably heard at certain public proceedings in the district court, including proceedings involving 
release. Accordingly, we wanted to be in touch consistent with our responsibilities and obligations—and your client's 
rights—under that statute, to see whether your client would like to be heard in any fashion, whether through a 
submission, a representation that we can include in our bail submission due Friday, or some other form. Of course no 
requirement or obligation, but we would be happy to discuss it if that would be useful. 
To the extent this information is useful in your consideration, I can say that we expect to vigorously oppose bail, as we 
indicated to the judge we would in the proceedings earlier this week. 
Please let me know if you'd like to discuss, no problem either way, and thanks as always.

Hey PCU —As you likely may have seen/heard at this point, last evening, we arrested Jeffrey Epstein on sex trafficking 
charges. Epstein is in custody and will be presented and arraigned on an Indictment that will be unsealed tomorrow 
morning. 
The case is an incredibly important one — not only is the conduct extremely serious and deeply disturbing — but our 
charges ensure that dozens if not more of Epstein's victims, girls who were as young as 14 at the time they were abused, 
will finally have their day in court. It is an extraordinarily worthy prosecution and just the latest example of how this unit 
will never shy away from bringing tough cases against powerful people who have committed grievous crimes. 
Please join me and 
in extending a very well-deserved congratulations to the team 
who 
have worked tirelessly to make this case happen (and happen so quickly). They have done us all proud, and if you are 
free, we hope you join us for the press conference formally announcing the charges, which should happen Monday 
morning at 11.

Dear Judge Pitman, 
With apologies for being in touch over the weekend, we wanted to write to advise you regarding our expected application 
tomorrow morning to unseal Indictment 19 Cr. 490, United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, and to have a district judge assigned 
to the case (from Wheel C). Attached is an electronic copy of the application and proposed order we expect to formally 
submit first thing tomorrow morning, in case that is useful for the Court to have in advance. 
We believe that Judge Moses may have advised you that this presentment might occur on Monday, but we also wanted to 
be in touch directly, particularly because we expect there may be significant press and public attention and attendance at 
a proceeding before your honor, if the district judge refers presentment. 
If you would prefer that we schedule an early-morning time tomorrow to come to court to submit the application and 
effect a wheel-out, we would be happy to be available as early as is practicable for the Court, or otherwise we will call 
chambers in the morning for guidance on what the Court prefers. And I am available for any questions anytime in the 
interim, or tomorrow, via phone at 
Thank you.

Hey! 
>, 
I searched Epstein's travel records from 6/1/2019 to 6/27/2019 at noon and attached the record. His last record 
shows an OUTBOUND flight on 6/14/2019 to Paris. 
Search capabilities only show international travel and are limited if he travels to the islands because it is US 
Territory. It is unclear why some OUTBOUND/INFBOUND records show Epstein going to/from the islands 
and others don't but it is likely up to how CBP inputs their information. 
Hope this helps!

Good afternoon, 
(USANYS)' 
As I think you all know Nick has been placed in SHU based on an allegation that he was in possession of a cell phone. If 
true, I understand that some appropriate and proportional sanction may be in order. 
Leaving that aside I want to address the conditions in his cell. The toilet is leaking and the floor is wet. As of 
Wednesday, he hasn't received his personal property, including his books. He has been sitting in the cell with literally 
nothing to read, listen to or watch. Can we please make an effort to get him reading material, his radio and the 
accompanying batteries. 
Most troubling is that he tells me that the legal work he had out when he was removed from the cell has not been 
returned to him. This included documents prepared for him by my office which contained substantial and sensitive 
work product that falls squarely within the attorney client privilege. Nick made notes on some of these documents to 
prepare for our next meeting. When I saw him Wednesday, he had some of his legal paperwork but not the 
documents he was working with when he was taken from the cell. I am very concerned that these documents have 
EFTA00028385
--- PAGE 3 ---
been seized by the staff at MCC. Can you please take steps to see to that all of this material be returned to him 
immediately. 
Lastly, I am hoping we can find time early next week to discuss the conditions of Nick's confinement going forward.

I. Introduction 
A. Affiant 
1. 
I have been a Special Agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBP") since 
2017. During that time, I have participated in numerous investigations and prosecutions of crimes 
against children, including the sex trafficking of minors. I have also participated in the execution 
of multiple search warrants. 
2. 
I make this Affidavit in support of an application pursuant to Rule 41 of the Federal 
Rules of Criminal Procedure for a warrant to search the premises specified below (the "Subject 
Premises") for the purpose of photographing, video-recording or otherwise documenting the 
appearance of its interior, and to seize the items and information described in Attachment A. This 
affidavit is based upon my personal knowledge; my review of documents and other evidence; and 
my conversations with other law enforcement personnel. Because this affidavit is being submitted 
for the limited purpose of establishing probable cause, it does not include all the facts that I have 
learned during the course of my investigation. Where the contents of documents and the actions, 
statements, and conversations of others are reported herein, they are reported in substance and in 
part, except where otherwise indicated.

B. The Subject Premises 
3. 
The Subject Premises are particularly described as a nearly 19,000 square foot 
multi-story, single-family residence located at 9 East 71st Street, New York, New York, and 
include all locked and closed containers found therein. As detailed further herein, the Subject 
Premises is believed to be owned, possessed and controlled by JEFFREY EPSTEIN, a target 
subject of this investigation. A photograph of the front entrance to the Subject Premises is included 
below: 
C. The Target Subject and the Subject Offenses 
4. 
The Target Subject of this investigation is JEFFREY EPSTEIN. 
5. 
For the reasons detailed below, I believe that there is probable cause to believe that 
the Subject Premises contain evidence, fruits, and instrumentalities of violations of Title 18, United 
States Code, Section 1591 (sex trafficking of minors) and Title 18, United States Code, Section 
371 (sex trafficking conspiracy) (the "Subject Offenses") by the Target Subject.

H. Probable Cause 
A. Probable Cause Regarding the Target Subject's Commission of the 
Subject Offenses 
6. 
On or about July 2, 2019. a grand jury in this District returned an Indictment 
charging JEFFREY EPSTEIN with the Subject Offenses. A copy of the Indictment is attached 
hereto as Exhibit A and is incorporated by reference. 
B. Probable Cause Justifying Search of the Subject Premises 
7. 
As set forth in Exhibit A, from at least in or about 2002, up to and including at least 
in or about 2005, JEFFREY EPSTEIN sexually abused multiple minor girls in the Southern 
District of New York and elsewhere. During that time and continuing to the present, EPSTEIN 
possessed and controlled the Subject Premises, which is described in Exhibit A as "the New York 
Residence." 
8. 
As further set forth in paragraphs 8 through 10 of Exhibit A, from at least in or 
about 2002, up to and including at least in or about 2005, EPSTEIN sexually abused numerous 
minor victims at the Subject Premises. In particular, and as alleged in the Indictment, when a 
victim arrived at the Subject Premises, she would be escorted to a room inside the Subject Premises 
with a massage table, where she would perform a massage on EPSTEIN. The victims, who were 
as young as 14 years of age, were told by EPSTEIN or other individuals to partially or fully undress 
before beginning the "massage." During the encounter, EPSTEIN would escalate the nature and 
scope of physical contact with his victim to include, among other things, sex acts such as groping 
and direct and indirect contact with the victims' genitals. EPSTEIN typically would also 
masturbate during these sexualized encounters, ask victims to touch him while he masturbated, 
and touch victims' genitals with his hands or with sex toys. Following each encounter, EPSTEIN 
or one of his employees or associates paid the victim in cash. 
2017.08.02 
EFTA00028391
--- PAGE 5 ---
9. 
As set forth in paragraphs 12 through 13 of Exhibit A, to further facilitate his ability 
to abuse minor girls in New York, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, asked and enticed certain 
of his victims to recruit additional minor girls to perform "massages" and similarly engage in sex 
acts with EPSTEIN. When a victim would recruit another minor girl for EPSTEIN, he paid both 
the victim-recruiter and the new victim hundreds of dollars in cash. EPSTEIN knew that his 
victims were underage, including because certain victims told him their age. 
10. 
One of the victims identified in paragraph 22 of Exhibit A is Victim-1. As part of 
the FBI's investigation of EPSTEIN, other law enforcement officers and I have interviewed 
Victim-1i I know from my personal participation of interviews with Victim-1, my conversations 
with other law enforcement officers who have interviewed Victim-1, and my review of notes and 
reports of other interviews with Victim-I that Victim-1 has provided the following information, in 
substance and in part: 
a. Between approximately 2002 and 2005, EPSTEIN sexually abused Victim-1 on 
multiple occasions in the Subject Premises. This sexual abuse all occurred when Victim-1 was 
under the age of 18. 
b. During that same period, Victim-1 observed multiple floors of the Subject Premises 
and numerous individual rooms within the Subject Premises. Victim-1 has provided detailed 
descriptions of certain aspects of the interior of the Subject Premises, including Victim-1 's 
In meetings with the Government, Victim-1 has disclosed that, approximately a decade ago, she 
committed marriage fraud in order to obtain a green card and, subsequently, U.S. citizenship. She 
has also disclosed personal substance abuse, primarily involving the abuse of prescription drugs, 
during various periods between the early 2000s and 2019. Victim-1 has also disclosed having 
worked for approximately a year at a "happy-ending" massage parlor, performing paid sex acts. 
Victim-1 is currently pursuing a civil damages claim against EPSTEIN for his sexual abuse of her. 
Information provided by Victim-1 has proven reliable and has been corroborated by independent 
evidence, including documents and records obtained during the investigation and the accounts of 
other victims whom Victim-1 has never met.

EFTA00028392
--- PAGE 6 ---
memory of specific details regarding the layout, furnishings, decorations, and floor pattern of 
various areas within the Subject Premises. 
II. 
I know from my review of publicly available corporate and property records that at 
all times relevant to the Subject Offenses as alleged in the Indictment, the Subject Premises was 
owned by Nine East 71st Street Corporation (the "Corporation"). The President of the Corporation 
is listed as JEFFREY EPSTEIN, and no other officers or occupants are identified on the 
Corporation paperwork. In or around December 2011, the Subject Premises was transferred from 
the Corporation to another corporate entity, Maple, Inc., which is registered in the U.S. Virgin 
Islands, where EPSTEIN was then known to and continues to reside. Though no officer of Maple, 
Inc., is identified in the transfer paperwork, the signature of both the buyer and seller in the 
transaction appear to be the same. Moreover, the deed lists the consideration for the transfer of 
the Subject Premises as $10, an amount facially inconsistent with a fair market transfer to a third 
party. 
12. 
I know from my participation in this investigation that EPSTEIN has continued to 
possess and control the Subject Premises from at least in or about 2002 to the present. In particular, 
I know from my review of Sex Offender Registration records that EPSTEIN presently lists the 
Subject Premises as one of his residences. Moreover, as described in paragraph 11, above, 
although ownership of Subject Premises was transferred from one corporate entity to another in 
December 2011, both corporations appear to be under EPSTEIN's control, and EPSTEIN appears 
to remain the sole owner and occupant of the Subject Premises. 
13. 
Additionally, although Victim-1 has not been in the Subject Premises since in or 
around 2005, based on my review of publicly available records maintained by the New York City 
Department of Buildings ("DOB"), it does not appear that there have been any significant or 
2017.08.02 
EFTA00028393
--- PAGE 7 ---
structural renovations to the interior of the Subject Premises since that time. In particular, the 
DOB reflects only three approved alteration permits for the Subject Premises, one in or around 
2011 which authorized facade restoration but expressly noted that there would be "no change to 
occupancy, use egress or bulk," and two permitting the "installation of heavy duty sidewalk shed" 
outside of the Subject Premises at various points, but similarly noting that there would be "no 
changes in use, egress or occupancy." As such, while it is possible that certain interior decorations 
have changed since 2005, it is probable that structural components of the interior, such as 
Victim-I's description of the layout of rooms and floors, among other details, would remain the 
same.

EFTA00028394
--- PAGE 8 ---
III. Conclusion and Ancillary Provisions 
14. 
Based on the foregoing, I respectfully submit that there is probable cause to believe 
that photographing, video-recording, and otherwise documenting the appearance of the interior of 
the Subject Premises, and seizing the items described in Attachment A, will yield evidence of the 
Subject Offenses. In particular, evidence depicting the interior of the Subject Premises and 
reflecting the occupancy, ownership, layout, furnishings, decorations, and floor pattern of the 
Subject Premises will corroborate Victim-1's account of EPSTEIN's commission of the Subject 
Offenses. I further submit that there is probable cause to believe that such evidence will be located 
within the Subject Premises and therefore request the court to issue a warrant to seize the items 
and information specified in Attachment A to this affidavit and to the Search and Seizure Warrant.

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
Defendant.

SEALED 
INDICTMENT 
x 
Cr. 
CRIM 490 
COUNT ONE 
(Sex Trafficking Conspiracy) 
The Grand Jury charges: 
OVERVIEW 
1. 
As set forth herein, over the course of many 
years, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, sexually exploited and 
abused dozens of minor girls at his homes in Manhattan, New 
York, and Palm Beach, Florida, among other locations. 
2. 
In particular, from at least in or about 2002, up 
to and including at least in or about 2005, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, enticed and recruited, and caused to be enticed and 
recruited, minor girls to visit his mansion in Manhattan, New 
York (the "New York Residence") and his estate in Palm Beach, 
Florida (the "Palm Beach Residence") to engage in sex acts with 
him, after which he would give the victims hundreds of dollars 
in cash. Moreover, and in order to maintain and increase his 
supply of victims, EPSTEIN also paid certain of his victims to 
recruit additional girls to be similarly abused by EPSTEIN. In 
EFTA00028398
--- PAGE 12 ---
this way, EPSTEIN created a vast network of underage victims for 
him to sexually exploit in locations including New York and 
Palm Beach. 
3. 
The victims described herein were as young as 14 
years old at the time they were abused by JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, and were, for various reasons, often particularly 
vulnerable to exploitation. EPSTEIN intentionally sought out 
minors and knew that many of his victims were in fact under the 
age of 18, including because, in some instances, minor victims 
expressly told him their age. 
4. 
In creating and maintaining this network of minor 
victims in multiple states to sexually abuse and exploit, 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, worked and conspired with 
others, including employees and associates who facilitated his 
conduct by, among other things, contacting victims and 
scheduling their sexual encounters with EPSTEIN at the New York 
Residence and at the Palm Beach Residence. 
FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
5. 
During all time periods charged in this 
Indictment, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, was a financier with 
multiple residences in the continental United States, including 
the New York Residence and the Palm Beach Residence. 
6. 
Beginning in at least 2002, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, enticed and recruited, and caused to be enticed and 
EFTA00028399
--- PAGE 13 ---
recruited, dozens of minor girls to engage in sex acts with him, 
after which EPSTEIN paid the victims hundreds of dollars in 
cash, at the New York Residence and the Palm Beach Residence. 
7. 
In both New York and Florida, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
the defendant, perpetuated this abuse in similar ways. Victims 
were initially recruited to provide "massages" to EPSTEIN, which 
would be performed nude or partially nude, would become 
increasingly sexual in nature, and would typically include one 
or more sex acts. EPSTEIN paid his victims hundreds of dollars 
in cash for each encounter. Moreover, EPSTEIN actively 
encouraged certain of his victims to recruit additional girls to 
be similarly sexually abused. EPSTEIN incentivized his victims 
to become recruiters by paying these victim-recruiters hundreds 
of dollars for each girl that they brought to EPSTEIN. In so 
doing, EPSTEIN maintained a steady supply of new victims to 
exploit. 
The New York Residence 
8. 
At all times relevant to this Indictment, JEFFREY 
EPSTEIN, the defendant, possessed and controlled a multi-story 
private residence on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, New York, 
i.e., the New York Residence. Between at least in or about 2002 
and in or about 2005, EPSTEIN abused numerous minor victims at 
the New York Residence by causing these victims to be recruited 
to engage in paid sex acts with him. 
EFTA00028400
--- PAGE 14 ---
9. 
When a victim arrived at the New York Residence, 
she typically would be escorted to a room with a massage table, 
where she would perform a massage on JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant. The victims, who were as young as 14 years of age, 
were told by EPSTEIN or other individuals to partially or fully 
undress before beginning the "massage." During the encounter, 
EPSTEIN would escalate the nature and scope of physical contact 
with his victim to include, among other things, sex acts such as 
groping and direct and indirect contact with the victim's 
genitals. EPSTEIN typically would also masturbate during these 
sexualized encounters, ask victims to touch him while he 
masturbated, and touch victims' genitals with his hands or with 
sex toys. 
10. In connection with each sexual encounter, JEFFREY 
EPSTEIN, the defendant, or one of his employees or associates, 
paid the victim in cash. Victims typically were paid hundreds 
of dollars in cash for each encounter. 
11. JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, knew that many of 
his New York victims were underage, including because certain 
victims told him their age. Further, once these minor victims 
were recruited, many were abused by EPSTEIN on multiple 
subsequent occasions at the New York Residence. EPSTEIN 
sometimes personally contacted victims to schedule appointments 
at the New York Residence. In other instances, EPSTEIN directed 
EFTA00028401
--- PAGE 15 ---
employees and associates, including a New York-based employee 
("Employee-1"), to communicate with victims via phone to arrange 
for these victims to return to the New York Residence for 
additional sexual encounters with EPSTEIN. 
12. Additionally, and to further facilitate his 
ability to abuse minor girls in New York, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, asked and enticed certain of his victims to recruit 
additional girls to perform "massages" and similarly engage in 
sex acts with EPSTEIN. When a victim would recruit another girl 
for EPSTEIN, he paid both the victim-recruiter and the new 
victim hundreds of dollars in cash. Through these victim-
recruiters, EPSTEIN gained access to and was able to abuse 
dozens of additional minor girls. 
13. In particular, certain recruiters brought dozens 
of additional minor girls to the New York Residence to give 
massages to and engage in sex acts with JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant. EPSTEIN encouraged victims to recruit additional 
girls by offering to pay these victim-recruiters for every 
additional girl they brought to EPSTEIN. When a victim-
recruiter accompanied a new minor victim to the New York 
Residence, both the victim-recruiter and the new minor victim 
were paid hundreds of dollars by EPSTEIN for each encounter. In 
addition, certain victim-recruiters routinely scheduled these 
EFTA00028402
--- PAGE 16 ---
encounters through Employee-1, who sometimes asked the 
recruiters to bring a specific minor girl for EPSTEIN. 
The Palm Beach Residence 
14. In addition to recruiting and abusing minor girls 
in New York, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, created a similar 
network of minor girls to victimize in Palm Beach, Florida, 
where EPSTEIN owned, possessed and controlled another large 
residence, i.e., the Palm Beach Residence. EPSTEIN frequently 
traveled from New York to Palm Beach by private jet, before 
which an employee or associate would ensure that minor victims 
were available for encounters upon his arrival in Florida. 
15. At the Palm Beach Residence, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, engaged in a similar course of abusive conduct. 
When a victim initially arrived at the Palm Beach Residence, she 
would be escorted to a room, sometimes by an employee of 
EPSTEIN's, including, at times, two assistants ("Employee-2" and 
"Employee-3") who, as described herein, were also responsible 
for scheduling sexual encounters with minor victims. Once 
inside, the victim would provide a nude or semi-nude massage for 
EPSTEIN, who would himself typically be naked. During these 
encounters, EPSTEIN would escalate the nature and scope of the 
physical contact to include sex acts such as groping and direct 
and indirect contact with the victim's genitals. EPSTEIN would 
also typically masturbate during these encounters, ask victims 
EFTA00028403
--- PAGE 17 ---
to touch him while he masturbated, and touch victims' genitals 
with his hands or with sex toys. 
16. In connection with each sexual encounter, JEFFREY 
EPSTEIN, the defendant, or one of his employees or associates, 
• 
paid the victim in cash. Victims typically were paid hundreds 
of dollars for each encounter. 
17. JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, knew that certain 
of his victims were underage, including because certain victims 
told him their age. In addition, as with New York-based 
victims, many Florida victims, once recruited, were abused by 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, on multiple additional 
occasions. 
18. JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, who during the 
relevant time period was frequently in New York, would arrange 
for Employee-2 or other employees to contact victims by phone in 
advance of EPSTEIN's travel to Florida to ensure appointments 
were scheduled for when he arrived. In particular, in certain 
instances, Employee-2 placed phone calls to minor victims in 
Florida to schedule encounters at the Palm Beach Residence. At 
the time of certain of those phone calls, EPSTEIN and Employee-2 
were in New York, New York. Additionally, certain of the 
individuals victimized at the Palm Beach Residence were 
contacted by phone by Employee-3 to schedule these encounters. 
EFTA00028404
--- PAGE 18 ---
19. Moreover, as in New York, to ensure a steady 
stream of minor victims, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, asked 
and enticed certain victims in Florida to recruit other girls to 
engage in sex acts. EPSTEIN paid hundreds of dollars to victim-
recruiters for each additional girl they brought to the Palm 
Beach Residence. 
STATUTORY ALLEGATIONS 
20. From at least in or about 2002, up to and 
including in or about 2005, in the Southern District of New York 
and elsewhere, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, and others known 
and unknown, willfully and knowingly did combine, conspire, 
confederate, and agree together and with each other to commit an 
offense against the United States, to wit, sex trafficking of 
minors, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section.
1591(a) and (b). 
21. It was a part and object of the conspiracy that 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, and others known and unknown, 
would and did, in and affecting interstate and foreign commerce, 
recruit, entice, harbor, transport, provide, and obtain, by any 
means a person, and to benefit, financially and by receiving 
anything of value, from participation in a venture which has 
engaged in any such act, knowing that the person had not 
attained the age of 18 years and would be caused to engage in a 
EFTA00028405
--- PAGE 19 ---
commercial sex act, in violation of Title 18, United States 
Code, Sections 1591(a) and (b) (2). 
Overt Acts 
22. In furtherance of the conspiracy and to effect 
the illegal object thereof, the following overt acts, among 
others, were committed in the Southern District of New York and 
elsewhere: 
a. 
In or about 2004, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, enticed and recruited multiple minor victims, 
including minor victims identified herein as Minor Victim-1, 
Minor Victim-2, and Minor Victim-3, to engage in sex acts with 
EPSTEIN at his residences in Manhattan, New York, and Palm 
Beach, Florida, after which he provided them with hundreds of 
dollars in cash for each encounter. 
b. 
In or about 2002, Minor Victim-1 was 
recruited to engage in sex acts with EPSTEIN and was repeatedly 
sexually abused by EPSTEIN at the New York Residence over a 
period of years and was paid hundreds of dollars for each 
encounter. EPSTEIN also encouraged and enticed Minor Victim-1 
to recruit other girls to engage in paid sex acts, which she 
did. EPSTEIN asked Minor Victim-1 how old she was, and Minor 
Victim-1 answered truthfully. 
c. 
In or about 2004, Employee-1, located in the 
Southern District of New York, and on behalf of EPSTEIN, placed 
EFTA00028406
--- PAGE 20 ---
a telephone call to Minor Victim-1 in order to schedule an 
appointment for Minor Victim-1 to engage in paid sex acts with 
EPSTEIN. 
d. 
In or about 2004, Minor Victim-2 was 
recruited to engage in sex acts with EPSTEIN and was repeatedly 
sexually abused by EPSTEIN at the Palm Beach Residence over a 
period of years and was paid hundreds of dollars after each

Understood, and thanks very much. Just on the risk assessment, is there any way at all for them to pull that? We expect 
we may get questions on it at the bail hearing on Monday, so totally understand it's with the vendor but if it's all possible 
to pull that file so we can have a copy that would be great — just wanted to check.

The discovery of the photographs will not have any effect on, nor will it alter, the status of his sex offender 
registration. We have conferred with the NYS Division of Criminal Justice Services (DCJS) in Albany in order to 
obtain his case file which would include the risk assessment. They are in the middle of a multi-year project to 
digitally scan all of their dots and the Epstein file is with the vendor. We should have it within 10 days.

Thanks very much for being in touch, and I'm in receipt of your email — should Mr. Epstein be granted bail and released, I 
will certainly advise his attorneys that he or they must contact you immediately to arrange for the processes required in

New York State. I'm also copying my colleagues on the case, prosecutors 
and S 
so they're 
aware of the issue as well. 
Separately, at the bail hearing yesterday the judge asked if there is any effect from the discovery of nude and partially-
nude photographs of women and girls who appear to be young, including possibly under 18 years of age, discovered 
during a search on Saturday in his New York residence. Do you know if there is any impact of that with respect to his New 
York registration and/or offender status? Or if there's another person I should check with about that? I'm happy to give 
anyone a call. 
Similarly, I believe that there may have been a 2011 state risk assessment in connection with Epstein—is it possible to 
obtain a copy of that?

Mr. 
Thank you very much for taking the time today to speak to me regarding the Epstein case. As I mentioned Mr. 
Epstein is a registered Level 3 sex offender in the State Of New York and should he be released and establish 
residence in NYC he is legally obligated to appear at my office ever 90 days. In addition, he is required to have a 
new photo taken every 3 years (his current photo is 9 years old). If he is released his immediate appearance at 
my office should be mandatory. Please feel free to reach out to me should you have any additional questions or 
concerns in this matter.

Re: 
United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 (RMB) 
Dear Judge Berman: 
The Government respectfully submits this letter in response to the defendant's motion for 
leave to file a supplemental financial disclosure under seal (the "Sealing Motion") in connection 
with his motion for pretrial release (the "Bail Motion"). 
The Government takes no position on the defendant's application, but notes that as of this 
filing the Government still has not yet received any financial disclosure or information from the 
defense in connection with the defendant's application for bail. It is now more than three days 
following the defendant's initial presentment, more than seven hours after the defendant's deadline 
to file his Motion, and less than 24 hours before the Government's deadline to reply. There is no 
reason that the defendant need have waited until this evening to submit his Sealing Motion, and 
the Government cannot meaningfully respond to a Bail Motion that contains no material financial 
information, either under seal or otherwise. 
Accordingly, the Government respectfully requests that its deadline to respond to the 
defendant's Bail Motion be extended to at least 24 hours following the defendant's disclosure of 
any financial information upon which he intends to rely in connection with the Motion. Should

I'm sorry, this got cut off, let me try one more time — 
As you may already know, pursuant to the Crime Victims' Rights Act, specifically 18 U.S.C. 3771(a)(4), a crime victim has 
the right to be reasonably heard at certain public proceedings in the district court, including proceedings involving 
release. Accordingly, we wanted to be in touch consistent with our responsibilities and obligations—and your client's 
rights—under that statute, to see whether your client would like to be heard in any fashion, whether through a 
submission, a representation that we can include in our bail submission due Friday, or some other form. Of course no 
requirement or obligation, but we would be happy to discuss it if that would be useful. 
To the extent this information is useful in your consideration, I can say that we expect to vigorously oppose bail, as we 
indicated to the judge we would in the proceedings earlier this week. 
Would it make sense to set up a brief call sometime tomorrow, if any of you want to discuss? I should be able to make 
myself available whenever is convenient for you (and likely will be just me, as the remainder of the team will be traveling).

Hi 
Some points for discussion or consideration re draft Protective Order: 
Pg 2, line 2 - we consent to the entry of the Order but not necessarily all of the averments made by the Government in 
support of the Order 
Pg 3 - par 2 - we need to distinguish between providing discovery electronically to others on the defense team (encrypt or 
password protected) and providing hard copies of discovery for the purpose of review by counsel or by counsel or others 
on defense team with the defendant at MCC 
Pg 3 - par 3 -5 - these obligations should extend to Govt as well as defense 
Pg 3 - par 4 - are you precluding public discussion of identity of witnesses already known to the defense i.e. known 
independent of the discovery 
Pg 3/4 - par 5 - are you asking for redacted public filings or the entire filing being filed under seal - we could redact any 
quoting of the discovery or attaching of the discovery if that suffices 
Pg 4-5 par 7 - there is no need for allegations of potential obstruction or harm to witnesses in this case - I would request 
that such language be redacted as unnecessary if we are not contesting the clause. Please advise if the Govt intends to 
mark all 302s as "confidential" or just the identifying info (names, addresses, etc). 
Par 12 - defense should be allowed to retain discovery through the filing date of a 2255 
Reid, Mike may have additional questions, points. 
Available after 1 to discuss.

obligations (collectively, the "Discovery"), which contain 
sensitive, confidential, or personal identifying information; 
WHEREAS, the Government seeks to protect sensitive,

I. 
The Discovery disclosed to the defendant

Counsel") during the course of proceedings in this action:

Shall be used by the defendant or his 
counsel solely for purposes of the defense of this action;

provided copies of to, prospective witnesses and their counsel 
(collectively, "Potential Witnesses"), to the extent deemed 
necessary by defense counsel, for trial preparation. 
2. 
To the extent the Discovery is disclosed to 
Defense Staff, Defense Experts/Advisors, Other Authorized 
Persons, or Potential Witnesses, Defense Counsel shall instruct 
such individual(s) of the terms of this Order and that such 
individual(s) are bound by this Order. To the extent that 
Discovery is disseminated to Defense Staff, Defense 
Experts/Advisors, or Other Authorized Persons, Defense Counsel 
shall encrypt and/or password protect the Discovery. The 
provisions of this paragraph do not apply to communications 
exclusively between and among Defense Counsel.

be controlling absent contrary order of the Court. Highly 
Confidential Information disclosed to Defense Counsel during the 
course of proceedings in this action: 
a) 
Shall not be disseminated, transmitted, or 
otherwise copied and provided to Defense Counsel or the 
Defendant; 
b)

member of the defense team (i.e., attorneys, experts, 
consultants, paralegals, investigators, support personnel, and 
secretarial staff involved in the representation of the 
defendants in this case), all of whom are nonetheless bound by 
this Protective Order. 
12. Except for Discovery that has been made part of 
the record of this case, Defense Counsel shall return to the 
Government or securely destroy or delete all Discovery,

Regarding the court conference, we are unfortunately not able to reserve seats for anyone—the court manages court 
security and the crowd, so we don't have control over that. The other victim attorneys have been attending the 
conferences on their own, and although I don't know, I would guess that means that they have been arriving early.

great assistance in the search of property. USA Shappert recommended that you contact Fish and Wildlife

Following up on our phone conversation a few minutes ago, thank you again for speaking with me and explaining the 
search warrant process in your District. I understand we should plan to send you a copy of the affidavit (and any exhibits 
or other incorporated materials) and the Indictment, and you will let us know if there are any additional questions or 
follow-up on your end. I understand your magistrate judge will then review the application, and that she's available 
Monday through Friday (or weekends if necessary), and that if and when an application is approved it must be sworn 
before her in person. 
Our hope is to be in touch with you in the coming days, with the possibility of the agents executing the search this 
weekend, but we will keep in touch about that. And so you have the full contact information for all of our team, my

Thank you for the quick reply. I understand your position regarding communicating with all counsel of record. I 
assume that means your office won't be having separate communications (written or oral) with just appointed 
counsel. 
I. As I indicated, we will be filing a motion asking for an order allowing inspection of the location our client has 
been detained for what will likely be 4 years by the time the case is tried. Being able to present mitigating 
evidence to prevent Nick's execution is a "specific and pressing reason," at least in our view. We are happy to 
work with the BOP on reasonable conditions for the visit. 
2. I will wait to hear from her. Thanks for helping to move this alone. 
3. Thank you for the update on the hearing situation. I appreciate it. Knowing what the current situation is 
matters as does being to able to report back to the clients who brought the problem to my attention. 
4. This is a bit of a problem. I have been writing these emails since August. I do not think I should have to spell 
out how a requested visit helps in the preparation of the defense or how it will help our mitigation case. The 
tension between having a record made justifying the exception a ainst our right not to s ell out the details of our 
strategy was address back in August during a call that include 
. At that time we 
reached an agreement and we haven't had a problem until now. The requests have been no more than once a 
month or so and usually around court dates. We don't want to add to our workload or yours, but we can't have 
our client go months without seeing family as we prepare for a death penalty trial. Nor can provide the new level 
of detail being sought. Any further help you can provide would greatly appreciate.

we have copied all counsel because until Judge Karas instructs us otherwise, we intend to communicate with all 
counsel of record. 
> 1 — 
has advised us that allowing a tour of this kind is a security risk for the institution because, among 
other things, you have asked to tour areas where many inmates will be, and the institution cannot be locked down 
EFTA00028448
--- PAGE 2 ---
for purposes of an outside person taking a tour absent a very specific and pressing reason. 
also advised 
that were the Court to order such a tour, MCC would set very specific conditions and ask that the Government 
also be present. 
> 2 — 
has advised that she is working with SIS to get a date and time for the inspection of physical 
evidence, and hopefully will be reaching out today to schedule the inspection. 
> 3 — 
has advised that upon receiving your email, she had her staff speak with 
about the 
heat. The staff took heat reports in the unit and found the temperature was high. The staff made adjustments and 
there have not been complaints since. We have asked for another temperature reading to be taken in the unit 
before Wednesday's conference to ensure the temperature is at an acceptable level. 
> 4 — 
has advised that she asked you for additional information that she can discuss with the Warden in 
order to assess the request for a family visit, but has not heard back from you. As previously discussed, in order 
for the MCC to make an exception for your client, a social visit must be necessary for preparation of the defense. 
The Government is not trying to, nor does it want to be, in the middle of that assessment, but we understand 
from the MCC that your most recent request was conclusory and they need more detail to make an assessment of 
this new request.

years. Initially, we were told we would be permitted and that photographs would be taken and reviewed by the 
staff. We are going to file a motion to compel before the 22nd. 
> 2. I have written multiple emails to 
asking for an opportunity to view the physical evidence for the July 
23rd suicide attempt. She has thus not responded at all 
> 3. We wrote complaining about multiple reports of extreme heat on the tier. One or two inmates had to be 
hospitalized. We have not been given an update.

the judge to help here.

Hi 
Attached is the affidavit seeking a search warrant for Epstein's phone and ipad, as well as the electronic media seized from 
the suitcases at the house. Please review it and give me a call if you have any concerns or edits. Hope is to swear this out

Importance: Normal 
This is all amazing — thank you so much! Not that we had any doubts, but we're working up against a lot of bureaucracy in 
this case overall so we're very happy to be in your extremely capable hands for this part. 
On just basic logistics, the USAO number is 
indeed working on it, and it's Special Agent 
both in the C-20 squad. 
and the FBI investigation number is 
and NYPD Detective (but FBI TFO officer) 
— they are 
That all sounds great about notification, and we can check to see who the right contact person is on the FBI side to make 
sure the relevant information for the victims has been put into the FBI database (or if you have someone there you 
normally coordinate with, don't hesitate to reach out directly if that's preferable). 
We'll also definitely include that language with the 800 number in the press release, and I imagine we will also have 
say the number if there's a press conference as well. We'll also coordinate with the agents on whether they want to 
notify the victims at the time of arrest or whether we should give you that contact info, but either way we appreciate that 
you can do it. 
Please let me know if anything else would be useful for you at this stage? And today got away from me — just catching up 
on emails from this morning now — but we're generally around in the next day or two so can connect up at a time that 
works for you. 
thanks again,

The press release should have our 800 line 866 874-8900 that number rings on my desk. Something like, if you believe 
that you are a victim please call 
Victim Witness Coordinator at 8668748900 or If you believe you are a victim 
of this crime please call 8668748900. 
This is a case that FBI is working on too? So as the interviews are done the victim should have been put into the FBI data 
base. As soon the complaint is filed in Federal District Court all the information on the FBI side should cross over to us. 
We will send out the notice of charges filed immediately. Every time we have a court date victims will be noticed. Anyone 
that calls I will get the name and number and give it to the FBI.

If you would like on the day of the arrest I can call the victims that you have so far and make them aware that he has been 
arrested. 
Anything else you want done we will do. We are not the Southern District of Florida. 
I need the FBI investigation number and the USAO no. to make the smooth transition. 
I am around all day.

Subject: RE: case with many potential victims 
We are in the process of investigating Jeffrey Epstein, the billionaire who previously was granted a non-prosecution 
agreement following an investigation based in Florida, for conduct committed in New York—specifically, paying dozens of 
minor girls to engage in sex acts with him at his Manhattan mansion. The investigation is still very much covert and 
confidential, but we've quietly been in touch with victims in New York and Florida and we expect to charge the case in the 
next week or so. 
One extremely important element of the case will be making sure we comply with our victims' rights obligations, 
especially because in the initial Florida investigation the U.S. Attorney's Office violated those rights (as was recently found 
by a federal court in Florida). So we wanted to coordinate with you on the best way to provide information for victims to 
contact us. I think sometimes in a case like this we would have the victims call the FBI, but because of the extreme 
sensitivity about the prior U.S. Attorney's Office failing to meet the requirements, we may want to direct victims to 
contact us. 
It may be that we get very few calls, or we may get a ton—it will be a high-profile prosecution and it's been widely 
reported that he had dozens or hundreds of victims. Would there be a good time sometime in the next couple days to 
meet and talk about what you think would be most effective and most efficient in terms of making sure we have our 
bases covered? Some combination of the case team (me, M, 
and 
I are available anytime that's convenient 
for you, and we can also send any additional info that would be helpful. 
Thanks very much as always,

Gloria, 
We just needed a little time to rearrange schedules, as we had planned to do noon to 1:00 based on your request. 
However we will plan to come to your office as soon as the meeting this morning is concluded, including any individual 
questions that occur immediately after the general presentation, which occurred but was relatively limited following the 
corresponding meeting in Florida last week. My hope is that we'll be able to get to your office by 11:30, and we can email 
to let you know that we're on our way if that's helpful. Alternatively, if you and 
would prefer to meet at the FBI, that 
should be fine, you just may have to wait for a few minutes following the meeting. We can discuss either way this morning 
in person, but the upshot is that we'll meet with you as soon as possible after the meeting. 
thanks,

We will make ourselves available to meet with your new client on 10/23. Because the victim meeting is being run by

Human Trafficking and Sexual Exploitation of Minors 
This Office prioritizes the investigation and prosecution of numerous child pornography, child

In July 2019, prosecutors charged Jeffrey Epstein with sex trafficking of minors between 
2002 through 2005, Epstein sexually exploited and abused dozens of underage girls by 
enticing them to engage in sex acts with him in exchange for money. Epstein allegedly 
worked with several employees and associates to ensure that he had a steady supply of 
minor victims to abuse, and paid several of those victims themselves to recruit other 
underage girls to engage in similar sex acts for money. The indictment against Jeffrey 
Epstein was vacated following his death in August of 2019.

Again in connection with the Epstein investigation, we'd like to please request permission to travel for approximately 
three days next week for meetings and interviews in West Palm Beach, Florida. As of now we tentatively expect to fly 
down Tuesday night and return on Wednesday or Thursday (and will keep the timeframe as short as scheduling allows). 
Unfortunately we're still trying to pin down timing for interviewing the victims, so depending on the timing it will either 
be me and 
or 
and 
but we wanted to ask for permission now either way so we weren't doing it 
super last minute after the holiday on Tuesday. And also same as last time, we'd like to ask permission to reserve a 
conference room at the hotel for the interviews, please. 
thanks very much,

Re: Doe v. lndyke et al., No. 19-cv-08673 (S.D.N.Y.) (KPF) 
Dear Judge Failla: 
We represent Jane Doe in the above-captioned action. We write in response to Defendants' 
two letters filed yesterday regarding: (1) related case status (ECF 19); and (2) document 
preservation (ECF 20). 
Since we do not see any conceivable basis under Rule 13 of the Rules for the Division of 
Business Among District Judges in the Southern District to oppose designating these cases with 
overlapping defendants, legal issues, and factual allegations as related, we oppose Defendants' 
request for 30 days to respond. See Local Rule for the Division of Business Among District Judges 
in the Southern District 13(a); see also Poindexter v. Cash Money Records, No. 13-cv-5882, 2014 
WL 1383781, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 8, 2014); Pace v. Quintanilla, No. 13-cv-91, 2013 WL 
5405563, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 23, 2013). Our client was understandably shocked by the suicide 
of Jeffrey Epstein in federal custody, and is eager to obtain a modicum of justice as soon as 
possible. All we have seen from Defendants, however, are efforts at delay. We very much want 
to push this case forward to trial as soon as possible, and it is essential to have a judge assigned 
who will preside over the entire progress of the case in order to do so. I 
Notably, contrary to the suggestion in Defendants' letter, Plaintiff is not seeking consolidation at this time. 
We further note that the cases that Plaintiff has proposed as related have now all been reassigned to the same 
magistrate judge, including: VE v. Nine East 71st Street et al., No. 19-cv-07625 (S.D.N.Y.) (Nathan, J.); Doe 1 el al.

Case 1:19-cv-08673-KPF Document 21 Filed 11/06/19 Page 2 of 2 
KAPLAN HECKER & FINK LLP 
As for preservation, the issues we have raised regarding preservation present yet another 
compelling reason why these cases should be marked as related since the risks of spoliation face 
plaintiffs in all cases. While we appreciate Defendants' explanation about Mr. Epstein's clothing 
(which was not previously provided to us), that was not the point of our prior letters and emails to 
Defendants. (See, e.g., ECF 14 Ex. A.) The point of our letters and emails was that we have asked 
Defendants to identify which categories of documents and other information we have specified for 
preservation they believe are "argumentative, assume facts that have not been proven and implicate 
information protected by the attorney-client privilege and attorney work product doctrine," and are 
therefore not being preserved. Defendants have failed to answer that simple question, which 
understandably causes us great concern about spoliation given Mr. Epstein's multiple residences 
across the globe, the fact that one of the two Defendant executors is a lawyer, and the fact that, as 
a result of a will he signed just before his death, Mr. Epstein's estate is being probated in the Virgin 
Islands. 
We look forward to discussing these issues with Your Honor in Court tomorrow. 
Respectfully submitted,

I also created a sub folder for emails with attachments. I excluded Westlaw emails and generally only included the last

There are some early emails with a US Marshal regarding JE's international travel and registration from when I was 
digging into any potential violations of the International Megan's Law. Not sure if you guys were on those 
correspondence at the beginning so I wanted to highlight that for you. 
Please let me know if you need anything else.

affidavit is being submitted for the limited purpose of establishing probable cause, it does not 
include all the facts that I have learned during the course of my investigation. Where the contents 
of documents and the actions, statements, and conversations of others are reported herein, they are 
reported in substance and in part, except where otherwise indicated. 
B. The Subject Premises 
3. 
The Subject Premises are particularly described as a multi-story, single-family 
residence located at 
New York, New York, and include all locked and closed 
containers found therein. As detailed further herein, the Subject Premises is believed to be owned, 
possessed and controlled by JEFFREY EPSTEIN, a target subject of this investigation. A 
photograph of the front entrance to the Subject Premises is included below: 
C. The Target Subject and the Subject Offenses 
4. 
The Target Subject of this investigation is JEFFREY EPSTEIN. 
5. 
For the reasons detailed below, I believe that there is probable cause to believe that 
the Subject Premises contain evidence, fruits, and instrumentalities of violations of Title 18, United 
2017.08.02 
EFTA00028486
--- PAGE 3 ---
masttitbate during these sexualized encounters, ask victims to touch him while he masturbated, 
and touch victims' genitals with his hands or with sex toys. Following each encounter, EPSTEIN 
or one of his employees or associates paid the victim in cash. 
9. 
As set forth in paragraphs 12 through 13 of Exhibit A, to further facilitate his ability 
to alitthe minor girls in New York, JEFFREY EPS 1 asked and enticed certain of his victims to 
=rah additional minor girls to perform "massages" and similarly engage in sex acts with 
EPSTEIN. When a victim would recruit another minor girl for EPSTEIN, he paid both the victim-
reuniter and the new victim hundreds of dollars in cash. EPSTEIN knew that his victims were 
underage, including because certain victims told him their age. 
10. 
One of the victims identified in paragraph 22 of Exhibit A is Victim-I. As part of 
the FBI's investigation of EPSI tIN, other law enforcement officers have interviewed Victim-1.' 
I knOW from my conversations with other law enforcement officers who have interviewed Victim-
1, that Victim-1 has provided the following information, in substance and in part: 
a. Between approximately 2002 and 2005, EPSTEIN sexually abused Victim-1 on 
multiple occasions in the Subject Premises. This sexual abuse all occurred when Victim-1 was 
under the age of 18. 
b. During that same period, Victim-1 observed multiple floors of the Subject Premises 
and numerous individual rooms within the Subject Premises. Victim-1 has provided detailed 
In meetings with the Government, Victim-1 has disclosed that, approximately a decade ago, she 
committed marriage fraud in order to obtain a green card and, subsequently, U.S. citizenship. She 
has MS() disclosed personal substance abuse, primarily involving the abuse of prescription drugs, 
during various periods between the early 2000s and 2019. Victim-1 has also disclosed having 
worked for approximately a year at a "happy-ending" massage parlor, performing paid sex acts. 
Victitt-1 is currently pursuing a civil damages claim against EPSTEIN for his sexual abuse of her. 
Infotroation provided by Victim-1 has proven reliable and has been corroborated by independent 
evidence, including documents and records obtained during the investigation and the accounts of 
other victims whom Victim-1 has never met.

from the ribcage to the clavicle (collectively, (the "Busts"). The Busts do not appear to be designed 
for use as sex toys, and appear instead to be artwork. Nevertheless, based on my conversations 
with law enforcement officers who have interviewed Victim-1, I have learned that the Busts appear 
to be generally consistent with Victim-1's description of observing the Torso in EPSTEIN's 
bathroom in the Subject Premises. Accordingly, there is probable cause to believe that the Busts 
are corroborating evidence of Victim-I's description of the Subject Premises. 
b. 
Inside the Subject Premises, I observed a room that, based on my conversations 
with law enforcement officers who have interviewed Victim-1, appears to be consistent with 
Victim-I's descriptions of the Massage Room. The room contained a table covered with a sheet, 
and appears to be a massage table. The walls appear to be covered in a type of felt-like tapestry 
fabric. I further observed two paintings and three photographs hanging on the walls of the Massage 
Room. The paintings and photographs depict nude females. One of the photographs appears to 
depict a nude girl. Based on my training and experience investigating crimes involving the sexual 
exploitation of children, the girl appears to be approximately 15 to 20 years old. 
c. 
Inside the Subject Premises, inside a closet adjacent to a bathroom, I observed a 
shelf that appears to contain several black binders, with labels on the spine of each binder. In 
particular, one of the binders is marked with a series of labels, one of which reads: "PB Girls." 
Giveri that the Indictment charges EPS 1 EIN with participating in a conspiracy to engage in sex 
trafficking of minor girls in both Palm Beach, Florida and New York, I believe that "PB Girls" 
may refer to minor victims in Palm Beach, Florida. 
d. 
Inside the Subject Premises, in what appears to be EPSTEIN's office, on or about 
the second floor of the Subject Premises, I observed what appears to be a taxidermied dog (the 
"Doe). Based on my conversations with law enforcement officers who have interviewed

COUNT ONE 
(Sex Trafficking Conspiracy) 
The Grand Jury charges: 
OVERVIEW 
1.  As set forth herein, over the course of many 
years, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, sexually exploited and 
abused dozens of minor girls at his homes in Manhattan, New 
York, and Palm Beach, Florida, among other locations. 
2. 
In particular, from at least in or about 2002, up 
to and including at least in or about 2005, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defehdant, enticed and recruited, and caused to be enticed and 
recruited, minor girls to visit his mansion in Manhattan, New 
York (the "New York Residence") and his estate in Palm Beach, 
Florida (the "Palm Beach Residonce") to engage in sex acts with 
him, after which he would give the victims hundreds of dollars 
in cash. Moreover, and in order to maintain and increase his 
supply of victims, EPSTEIN also paid certain of his victims to 
recruit additional girls to be similarly abused by EPSTEIN. In 
EFTA00028490
--- PAGE 7 ---
recruited, dozens of minor girls to engage in sex acts with him, 
after which EPSTEIN paid the victims hund*Oda of dollars in 
cash, at the, New York Residence and the Palm Beach Residence. 
7: 
In both New York and Florida, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
the defendant, perpetuated this abuse in similar ways. Victims 
were initially recruited to provide "massages" to EPSTEIN, which 
would be performed nude or partially nude, would become 
increasingly sexual in nature, and would typically include one 
or more sex acts. EPSTEIN paid his victims hundreds of dollars 
in cash for each encounter. Moreover, EPSTEIN actively 
encouraged certain of his victims' to recruit additional girls to 
be similarly sexually abused. EPSTEIN incentivized his victims 
to become recruiters by paying these victim-recruiters hundreds 
of dollars for each girl that they brought to EPSTEIN. In so 
doihg, EPSTEIN maintained a steady supply of new victims to 
exploit. 
The New York Residence 
8. 
At all times relevant to this Indictment, JEFFREY 
EPSTEIN, the defendant, possessed and controlled a multi-story 
private residence on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, New York, 
i.e., the New York Residence. Between at least in or about 2002 
and in or about 2005, ONTEIN abused numerous minor victims at 
. . 
the New York Residence by causing these victims to be recruited 
to engage in paid sex acts with him.

employees and associates, including a New York-based employee 
("Employee-1"), to communicate with victims via phone to arrange 
for these victims to return to the New York Residence for 
additional sexual encounters with EPSTEIN. 
12. Additionally, and to further facilitate his 
ability to abuse minor girls in New York, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, asked and enticed certain of his victims to recruit 
additional girls to perform "massages" and similarly engage in 
sex acts with EPSTEIN. When a victim would recruit another girl 
for EPSTEIN, he paid both the victim-recruiter and the new 
victim hundreds of dollars in cash. Through these victim-
recttiters, EPSTEIN gained access to and was able to abuse 
dozens of additional minor girls. 
13. In particular, certain recruiters brought dozens 
of additional minor girls to the New York Residence to give 
massages to and engage in sex acts with JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant. EPSTEIN encouraged victims to recruit additiona'l 
girls by offering to pay these victim-recruiters for every 
additional girl they brought to EPSTEIN. When a victim- 
recruiter accompanied a new minor victim to the New York 
Residence, both the victim-recruiter and the new minor victim 
were paid hundreds of dollars by EPSTEIN for each encounter. In 
addition, certain victim-recruiters routinely scheduled these

to touch him while he masturbated, and touch victims' genitals 
with his hands or with sex toys. 
16. In connection with each sexual encounter) JEFFREY 
EPSTEIN, the defendant or one of his employees or associates, 
paid the victim in cash. Victims 
of dollars for each encounter. 
17. JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, knew that certain 
of his victims were underage, including because certain victims
told him their age. In addition, as with New York-based::.. 
victims, many Florida victims, once recruited, were abused by 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, on multiple additional 
occasions. 
typically were paid hundreds 
18. JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, who during the 
releVant time period was frequently in New York, would arrange 
for Employee-2 or other employees to contact victims by phone in 
advance of EPSTEIN's travel to Florida to ensure appointments 
were scheduled for when he arrived: In particular, in certain
instances, Employee-2 placed phone calls to minor victims in 
Florida to schedule encounters at the Palm Beach Residence. At-' 
the time of certain of those phone calls, EPSTEIN and Employee-2 
were in New York, New York. Additionally, certain of the 
individuals victimized at the Palm Beach Residence were 
contacted by phone by Employee-3 to schedule these encounters.

Code, Sections 1591(a) and (b)(2). 
Overt Acts 
22. In furtherance of the conspiracy and to effect 
the illegal object thereof, the following overt acts, among 
others, were committed in the Southern District of New York and 
elsewhere: 
a. 
In or about 2004, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, enticed and recruited multiple minor victims, 
including minor victims identified herein as Minor Victim-1, 
Minor Victim-2, and Minor Victim-3, to engage in sex acts with 
EPSTEIN at his residences in Manhattan, New York, and Palm 
Beach, Florida, after which he provided them with hundreds of 
dollars in cash for each encounter. 
b. 
In or about 2002, Minor Victim-1 was 
recruited to engage in sex acts with EPSTEIN and was repeatedly 
sexually abused by EPSTEIN at the New York Residence over a 
period of years and was paid hundreds of dollars for each 
encounter. EPSTEIN also encouraged and enticed Minor Victim-1 
to recruit other girls to engage in paid sex acts, which she 
did. EPSTEIN asked Minor Victim-1 how old she was, and Minor 
Victim-1 answered truthfully.

In or about 2004, Employee-1, located in the 
Southern District of New York, and on behalf of EPSTEIN, placed

I. Introduction 
A. Affiant 
1. 
I have been a Special Agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI") since 
2017. During that time, I have participated in numerous investigations and prosecutions of crimes 
against children, including the sex trafficking of minors. I have also participated in the execution 
of multiple search warrants. 
2. 
I make this Affidavit in support of an application pursuant to Rule 41 of the Federal 
Rules of Criminal Procedure for a warrant to search the premises specified below (the "Subject 
Premises") for the purpose of photographing, video-recording or otherwise documenting the 
appearance of its interior, and to seize the items and information described in Attachment A. This 
affidavit is based upon my personal knowledge; my review of documents and other evidence; and 
my conversations with other law enforcement personnel. Because this affidavit is being submitted 
for the limited purpose of establishing probable cause, it does not include all the facts that I have 
learned during the course of my investigation. Where the contents of documents and the actions, 
statements, and conversations of others are reported herein, they are reported in substance and in 
part, except where otherwise indicated.

B. The Subject Premises 
3. 
The Subject Premises are particularly described as a nearly 19,000 square foot 
multi-story, single-family residence located at 
New York, New York, and 
include all locked and closed containers found therein. As detailed further herein, the Subject 
Premises is believed to be owned, possessed and controlled by JEFFREY EPSTEIN, a target 
subject of this investigation. A photograph of the front entrance to the Subject Premises is included 
below: 
C. The Target Subject and the Subject Offenses 
4. 
The Target Subject of this investigation is JEFFREY EPSTEIN. 
5. 
For the reasons detailed below, I believe that there is probable cause to believe that 
the Subject Premises contain evidence, fruits, and instrumentalities of violations of Title 18, United 
States Code, Section 1591 (sex trafficking of minors) and Title 18, United States Code, Section 
371 (sex trafficking conspiracy) (the "Subject Offenses") by the Target Subject.

--- PAGE 4 ---
II. Probable Cause 
A. Probable Cause Regarding the Target Subject's Commission of the 
Subject Offenses 
6. 
On or about July 2, 2019, a grand jury in this District returned an Indictment 
charging JEFFREY EPSTEIN with the Subject Offenses. A copy of the Indictment is attached 
hereto as Exhibit A and is incorporated by reference. 
B. Probable Cause Justifying Search of the Subject Premises 
7. 
As set forth in Exhibit A, from at least in or about 2002, up to and including at least 
in or about 2005, JEFFREY EPSTEIN sexually abused multiple minor girls in the Southern 
District of New York and elsewhere. During that time and continuing to the present, EPSTEIN 
possessed and controlled the Subject Premises, which is described in Exhibit A as "the New York 
Residence." 
8. 
As further set forth in paragraphs 8 through 10 of Exhibit A, from at least in or 
about 2002, up to and including at least in or about 2005, EPSTEIN sexually abused numerous 
minor victims at the Subject Premises. In particular, and as alleged in the Indictment, when a 
victim arrived at the Subject Premises, she would be escorted to a room inside the Subject Premises 
with a massage table, where she would perform a massage on EPSTEIN. The victims, who were 
as young as 14 years of age, were told by EPSTEIN or other individuals to partially or fully undress 
before beginning the "massage." During the encounter, EPSTEIN would escalate the nature and 
scope of physical contact with his victim to include, among other things, sex acts such as groping 
and direct and indirect contact with the victims' genitals. EPSTEIN typically would also 
masturbate during these sexualized encounters, ask victims to touch him while he masturbated, 
and touch victims' genitals with his hands or with sex toys. Following each encounter, EPSTEIN 
or one of his employees or associates paid the victim in cash. 
2017.08.02 
EFTA00028502
--- PAGE 5 ---
9. 
As set forth in paragraphs 12 through 13 of Exhibit A, to further facilitate his ability 
to abuse minor girls in New York, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, asked and enticed certain 
of his victims to recruit additional minor girls to perform "massages" and similarly engage in sex 
acts with EPSTEIN. When a victim would recruit another minor girl for EPSTEIN, he paid both 
the victim-recruiter and the new victim hundreds of dollars in cash. EPSTEIN knew that his 
victims were underage, including because certain victims told him their age. 
10. 
One of the victims identified in paragraph 22 of Exhibit A is Victim-1. As part of 
the FBI's investigation of EPSTEIN, other law enforcement officers and I have interviewed 
Victim-1.1 I know from my personal participation of interviews with Victim-1, my conversations 
with other law enforcement officers who have interviewed Victim-1, and my review of notes and 
reports of other interviews with Victim-1 that Victim-1 has provided the following information, in 
substance and in part: 
a. Between approximately 2002 and 2005, EPSTEIN sexually abused Victim-1 on 
multiple occasions in the Subject Premises. This sexual abuse all occurred when Victim-1 was 
under the age of 18. 
b. During that same period, Victim-1 observed multiple floors of the Subject Premises 
and numerous individual rooms within the Subject Premises. Victim-1 has provided detailed 
descriptions of certain aspects of the interior of the Subject Premises, including Victim-1's 
In meetings with the Government, Victim-1 has disclosed that, approximately a decade ago, she 
committed marriage fraud in order to obtain a green card and, subsequently, U.S. citizenship. She 
has also disclosed personal substance abuse, primarily involving the abuse of prescription drugs, 
during various periods between the early 2000s and 2019. Victim-1 has also disclosed having 
worked for approximately a year at a "happy-ending" massage parlor, performing paid sex acts. 
Victim-1 is currently pursuing a civil damages claim against EPSTEIN for his sexual abuse of her. 
Information provided by Victim-1 has proven reliable and has been corroborated by independent 
evidence, including documents and records obtained during the investigation and the accounts of 
other victims whom Victim-1 has never met. 
2017.08.02 
EFTA00028503
--- PAGE 6 ---
memory of specific details regarding the layout, furnishings, decorations, and floor pattern of 
various areas within the Subject Premises. 
11. 
I know from my review of publicly available corporate and property records that at 
all times relevant to the Subject Offenses as alleged in the Indictment, the Subject Premises was 
owned by Nine Fast 71st Street Corporation (the "Corporation"). The President of the Corporation 
is listed as JEFFREY EPSTEIN, and no other officers or occupants are identified on the 
Corporation paperwork. In or around December 2011, the Subject Premises was transferred from 
the Corporation to another corporate entity, Maple, Inc., which is registered in the U.S. Virgin 
Islands, where EPSTEIN was then known to and continues to reside. Though no officer of Maple, 
Inc., is identified in the transfer paperwork, the signature of both the buyer and seller in the 
transaction appear to be the same. Moreover, the deed lists the consideration for the transfer of 
the Subject Premises as $10, an amount facially inconsistent with a fair market transfer to a third 
Party-
12. 
I know from my participation in this investigation that EPSTEIN has continued to 
possess and control the Subject Premises from at least in or about 2002 to the present. In particular, 
I know from my review of Sex Offender Registration records that EPSTEIN presently lists the 
Subject Premises as one of his residences. Moreover, as described in paragraph 11, above, 
although ownership of Subject Premises was transferred from one corporate entity to another in 
December 2011, both corporations appear to be under EPSTEIN's control, and EPSTEIN appears 
to remain the sole owner and occupant of the Subject Premises. 
13. 
Additionally, although Victim-1 has not been in the Subject Premises since in or 
around 2005, based on my review of publicly available records maintained by the New York City 
Department of Buildings ("DOB"), it does not appear that there have been any significant or 
2017.08.02 
EFTA00028504
--- PAGE 7 ---
structural renovations to the interior of the Subject Premises since that time. In particular, the 
DOB reflects only three approved alteration permits for the Subject Premises, one in or around 
2011 which authorized facade restoration but expressly noted that there would be "no change to 
occupancy, use egress or bulk," and two permitting the "installation of heavy duty sidewalk shed" 
outside of the Subject Premises at various points, but similarly noting that there would be "no 
changes in use, egress or occupancy." As such, while it is possible that certain interior decorations 
have changed since 2005, it is probable that structural components of the interior, such as 
Victim-I's description of the layout of rooms and floors, among other details, would remain the 
same. 
2017.08.02 
EFTA00028505
--- PAGE 8 ---
III. Conclusion and Ancillary Provisions 
14. 
Based on the foregoing, I respectfully submit that there is probable cause to believe 
that photographing, video-recording, and otherwise documenting the appearance of the interior of 
the Subject Premises, and seizing the items described in Attachment A, will yield evidence of the 
Subject Offenses. In particular, evidence depicting the interior of the Subject Premises and 
reflecting the occupancy, ownership, layout, furnishings, decorations, and floor pattern of the 
Subject Premises will corroborate Victim-1's account of EPSTEIN's commission of the Subject 
Offenses. I further submit that there is probable cause to believe that such evidence will be located 
within the Subject Premises and therefore request the court to issue a warrant to seize the items 
and information specified in Attachment A to this affidavit and to the Search and Seizure Warrant.

COUNT ONE 
(Sex. Trafficking Conspiracy) 
The Grand Jury charges: 
OVERVIEW 
1.  As set forth herein, over the course of many 
years, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, sexually exploited and• 
abused dozens of minor girls at his homes in Manhattan, New .
York, and Palm Beach, Florida, among other locations. 
2. 
In particular, from at least in or about 2002, up 
to and including at least in or about 2005, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, enticed and recruited, and caused to be enticed and 
recruited, minor girls to visit his mansion in Manhattan, New 
York (the "New York Residence") and his estate in Palm Beach, 
Florida (the "Palm Beach Residence") to engage in sex acts with 
him, after which he would give the victims hundreds of dollars 
in cash. Moreover, and, in order to maintain and increase his 
supply of victims, EPSTEIN also paid certain of his victims to 
recruit additional girls to be similarly abused by EPSTEIN. In 
EFTA00028509
--- PAGE 12 ---
this way, EPSTEIN created a vast network of underage victims for 
him to sexually exploit in locations including New York and 
Palm Beach. 
3. 
The victims described herein were as young as 14 
years old at the time they were abused by JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, and were, for various reasons, often particularly 
vulnerable to exploitation. EPSTEIN intentionally sought out 
minors and knew that many of his victims were in fact under the 
age of 18, including because, in some instances, minor victims 
expressly told him their age. 
4. 
In creating and maintaining this network of minor 
victims in multiple states to sexually abuse and exploit, 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, worked and conspired with 
others, including employees and associates who facilitated his 
conduct by, among other things, contacting victims and 
scheduling their sexual encounters with EPSTEIN at the New York 
Residence and at the Palm Beach Residence. 
FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
5. 
During all time periods charged in this 
Indictment, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, was a financier with 
multiple residences in the continental United States, including 
the New York Residence and the Palm Beach Residence. 
6. 
Beginning in at least 2002, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, enticed and recruited, and caused to be enticed and 
EFTA00028510

recruited, dozens of minor girls to engage in sex acts with him, 
after which EPSTEIN paid the victims hundreds of dollars in 
cash, at the New York Residence and the Palm Beach Residence. 
7: 
In both New York and Florida, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
the defendant, perpetuated this abuse in similar ways. Victims
were initially recruited to provide "massages" to EPSTEIN, which 
would be performed nude or partially nude, would become 
increasingly sexual in nature, and would typically include one 
or more sex acts. EPSTEIN paid his victims hundreds of dollars 
in cash for each encounter. Moreover, EPSTEIN actively 
encouraged certain of his victims to recruit additional girls to 
be similarly sexually abused. EPSTEIN incentivized his victims 
to become recruiters by paying these victim-recruiters hundreds 
of dollars for each girl that they brought to EPSTEIN. In so 
doing, EPSTEIN maintained a steady supply of new victims to 
exploit. 
The New York Residence 
8. 
At all times relevant to this Indictment, JEFFREY 
EPSTEIN, the defendant, possessed and controlled a multi-story 
private residence on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, New York, 
i.e., the New York Residence. Between at least in or about 2002 
and in or about 2005, EPSTEIN abused numerous minor victims at 
the New York Residence by causing these victims to be recruited 
to engage in paid sex acts with him. 
EFTA00028511
--- PAGE 14 ---
9. 
When a victim arrived at the New York Residence, 
she typically would be escorted to a room with a massage table, 
where she would perform a massage on JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant. The victims, who were as young as 14 years of -age, 
were told by EPSTEIN or other individuals to partially or fully 
undress before beginning the "massage." During the encounter, 
EPSTEIN would escalate the nature and scope of physical contact 
with his victim to include, among other things, sex acts such as 
groping and direct and indirect contact with the victim's 
genitals. EPSTEIN typically would also masturbate during these 
sexualized encounters, ask victims to touch him while he 
masturbated, and touch victims' genitals with his hands or with 
sex toys. 
10. In connection with each sexual encounter, JEFFREY 
EPSTEIN, the defendant, or one of his employees or associates, 
paid the victim in cash. Victims typically were paid hundreds 
of dollars in cash for each encounter. 
11. JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, knew that many of 
his New York victims were underage, including because certain 
victims told him their age. Further, once these minor victims 
were recruited, many were abused by EPSTEIN on multiple 
subsequent occasions at the New York Residence. EPSTEIN 
sometimes personally contacted victims to schedule appointments 
at the New York Residence. In other instances, EPSTEIN directed 
EFTA00028512
--- PAGE 15 ---
employees and associates, including a New York-based employee 
("Employee-1"), to communicate with victims via phone to arrange 
for these victims to return to the New York Residence for 
additional sexual encounters with EPSTEIN. 
12. Additionally, and to further facilitate his 
ability to abuse minor girls in New York, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, asked and enticed certain of his victims to recruit 
additional girls to perform "massages" and similarly engage in 
sex acts with EPSTEIN. When a victim would recruit another girl 
for EPSTEIN, he paid both the victim-recruiter and the new 
victim hundreds of dollars in cash. Through these victim-
recruiters, EPSTEIN gained access to and was able to abuse 
dozens of additional minor girls. 
13. In particular, certain recruiters brought dozens 
of additional minor girls to the New York Residence to give 
massages to and engage in sex acts with JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant. EPSTEIN encouraged victims to recruit additional 
girls by offering to pay these victim-recruiters for every 
additional girl they brought to EPSTEIN. When a victim-
recruiter accompanied a new minor victim to the New York 
Residence, both the victim-recruiter and the new minor victim 
were paid hundreds of dollars by EPSTEIN for each encounter. In 
addition, certain victim-recruiters routinely scheduled these 
EFTA00028513
--- PAGE 16 ---
encounters through Employee-1, who sometimes asked the 
recruiters to bring a specific minor girl fox EPSTEIN. 
The Palm Beach Residence 
14. In addition to recruiting and abusing minor girls 
in New York, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, created a similar 
network of minor girls to victimize in Palm Beach, Florida, 
where EPSTEIN owned, possessed and controlled another large 
residence, i.e., the Palm Beach Residence. EPSTEIN frequently 
traveled from New York to Palm Beach by private jet, before 
which an employee or associate would ensure that minor victims 
were available for encounters upon his arrival in Florida. 
15. At the Palm Beach Residence, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, engaged in a similar course of abusive conduct. 
When a victim initially arrived at the Palm Beach Residence, she 
would be escorted to a room, sometimes by an employee of 
EPSTEIN's, including, at times, two assistants ("Employee-2" and' 
"Employee-3") who, as described herein, Were also responsible 
for scheduling sexual encounters with minor victims. Once 
inside, the victim would provide a nude or semi-nude massage for 
EPSTEIN, who would himself typically be naked. During these 
encounters, EPSTEIN would escalate the nature and scope of the 
physical contact to include sex acts such as groping and direct 
and indirect contact with the victim's genitals. EPSTEIN would 
alsO typically masturbate during these encounters, ask victims 
EFTA00028514
--- PAGE 17 ---
to touch him while he masturbated, and touch victims' genitals 
with his hands or with sex toys. 
16. In connection with each sexual encounter, JEFFREY 
EPSTEIN, the defendant, or one of his employees or associates, 
paid the victim in cash. Victims typically were paid hundreds 
of dollars for each encounter. 
17. JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, knew that certain 
of his victims were underage, including because certain victims 
told him their age. In addition, as with New York-based 
victims, many Florida victims, once recruited, were abused by 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, on multiple additional 
occasions. 
18. JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, who during the 
relevant time period was frequently in New York, would arrange 
for Employee-2 or other employees to contact victims by phone in 
advance of EPSTEIN's travel to Florida to ensure appointments 
were scheduled for when he arrived. In particular, in certain 
instances, Employee-2 placed phone calls to minor victims in 
Florida to schedule encounters at the Palm Beach Residence. At 
the time of certain of those phone calls, EPSTEIN and Employee-2 
were in New York, New York. Additionally, certain of the 
individuals victimized at the Palm Beach Residence were 
contacted by phone by Employee-3 to schedule these encounters. 
EFTA00028515
--- PAGE 18 ---
19. Moreover, as in New York, to ensure a steady 
stream of minor victims, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, asked 
and enticed certain victims in Florida to recruit other girls to 
engage in sex acts. EPSTEIN paid hundreds of dollars to victim-
recruiters for each additional girl they brought to the Palm 
Beach Residence.

As you know, the protective order distinguishes between all discovery and that marked "sensitive," and it is the sensitive 
discovery that cannot be publicly filed. 
statements to law enforcement do not fall into the sensitive 
category, so they should be publicly filed. We'd ask that, consistent with the protective order, any sensitive discovery and 
references to cooperators be redacted in your public filings. Along the same lines, we noticed that you publicly filed four 
documents that were marked sensitive (Exhibits A through D to your cell site motion) in violation of the protective order.

Thanks guys, this is all helpful. I think the only things we are still missing are the description of the premises 
(and photo) and our basis for believing he owned the island at the time of the charged conduct.

Sony to see the sad news about Epstein. I'm sure you're shaken. 
and I went through a similar 
suicide three years ago with a securities fraud defendant. If you need anything, we're here for you. You were

We were certainly saddened to see the news this morning, as I know all of you were. I appreciate that you have more 
pressing issues to deal with at the moment, but we are interested in whether you expect any aspect of the SONY's 
investigation/case to continue, potentially a separate civil forfeiture proceeding, or possible criminal prosecutions against 
other defendants. We also understand that you may not be in a position to tell us anything at the moment, which is fine. 
Just anticipating and preparing for questions we expect to be asked. Separately, having had the experience of a defendant in 
a case I charged commit suicide, I wanted to add that it can be a complicated feeling, and to the extent it is helpful, I think 
you brought a really important case and conducted yourselves in a professional, compassionate and impressive way. So 
despite sad news, and frustrating news after putting so much work into filing a case and preparing to see it through, heads 
should be held high.

Hey I spoke to 
and 
about this, but just to keep everyone in the loop, I did talk to Jeff on Sunday and did 
(what I thought was) a fairly standard witness / subject / target distinction, noting we didn't have sufficient information to 
put him into the witness or target boxes, and that we didn't currently intend to subpoena him or request to speak with 
him based on the investigation at this time. So I didn't specifically say he was a subject, but I noted the three categories 
and said we didn't have enough information for witness or target. I also said that there weren't specific allegations that 
we need to hear his side of at this time, and I think my intended point was conveyed, which was that we weren't currently 
asking for anything from him—not that there are no allegations at all, which obviously there are, publicly. I did not say 
that there is no allegation that the government is actively investigating; I just would never say to an attorney what we are 
or aren't investigating. In any event, my contemporaneous notes are attached, I typed and sent them less than ten 
minutes after our conversation, which lasted all of four minutes. I'm really sorry for any difficulties this causes us. 
After talking with 
about it, I also just spoke to Jeff and expressed my view that the statement does not fully 
accurately reflect our conversation, and that our press office could respond to questions about it or he could clarify, and 
he said he would get back to me with how he proposed to address the discrepancies.

EFTA00028546
--- PAGE 2 ---
Governor Bill Richardson offered his assistance in the Jeffrey Epstein investigation - through his lawyer, Jeff Brown of 
Dechert LLP - to the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York. In response to this offer, Mr. Brown was informed 
by the Assistant US Attorney responsible for the case that Governor Richardson is neither a target, subject, nor witness in 
the case and that there is no allegation against Governor Richardson that the government is actively investigating. 
"It's fair to conclude that the federal prosecutors investigating this matter do not believe the Governor participated in or 
witnessed the criminal activity Jeffrey Epstein is alleged to have committed," said Mr. Brown. 
Governor Richardson hopes that the investigation continues so that Epstein's victims can finally have their day in court 
and see the justice they deserve.

The Court will conduct a brief hearing on Tuesday, August 27, 2019 at 10:30 am. in 
connection with the nolle prosegui order proposed to the Court on August 19, 2019 by the United 
States Attorney. 
The Court believes that where, as here, a defendant has died before any judgment has 
been entered against him, the public may still have an informational interest in the process by 
which the prosecutor seeks dismissal of an indictment. 
At the hearing, Counsel for the Government and for the deceased Defendant, Jeffrey 
Epstein, will be heard. Counsel for the victims and the victims will also be heard, if they wish to 
be. 
The hearing will be held in Courtroom 17B.

Geoff —As discussed, I've put together a short proposed statement responding to the press release issued by Prince 
Andrew's counsel this morning. If we do issue something in response, as you'll see, I would recommend we keep it 
short and forward looking, rather than trying to rehash all of the various factual inaccuracies in his account of the 
past. 
Today, Prince Andrew yet again sought to falsely publicly portray himself as eager and willing to cooperate with an 
ongoing federal criminal investigation into sex trafficking and related offenses committed by Jeffrey Epstein and his 
associates, despite the fact that the Prince has never sat for an interview with federal authorities, has repeatedly 
declined our request to schedule such an interview, and several months ago informed us unequivocally —through the 
very same counsel who issued today's release -- that he would not come in for such an interview. If Prince Andrew is, 
in fact, serious about cooperating with a federal investigation, our doors have always been open, and we await word of 
when we should expect him.

On October 20, 2005, I assisted Defective

a search warrant at 358 El Brillo Way, Palm Beach, Florida, 33480. 
Upon the announcement of the search warrant, immediate contact was 
made with three white males who came out of the house or surrounding 
structures. Those males were identified as 
, and 
. As other members of the police department 
cleared the home, I kept watch over these three males. Once the house 
was cleared, those males were turned over to Detective 
DetectiveIMMEMMIand I were assigned to assist in the search of the 
main house, the cabana and the servant's quarters. We started in the 
garage. All areas of the garage were searched to include four 
vehicles. These vehicles were three black Mercedes Benz cars 
registered to Jeffrey Epstein. The fourth vehicle was a Harley 
Davidson motorcycle, green in color, registered to Jeffrey Epstein. 
Nothing was recovered from the garage. 
A towel closet and pantry located off the kitchen were searched and 
yielded negative results. 
The kitchen was searched and taken into evidence was a phone message 
book that was located near a house phone. 
North of the kitchen was an office room which contained a computer.

Today we have an additional discovery production ready to send to you. This production is small enough to produce via 
USAfx. Please let us know if you do not already have a USAfx account, in which case our paralegals (cc'd) can assist you in 
creating an account. We are also sending a CD containing this production to the MDC via FedEx. 
Attached please find a cover letter accompanying this production. As you will see in the letter, the majority of this 
production consists of materials we are providing in response to your requests for additional information regarding the 
SUPP production (referenced in the below email exchange). I am also attaching the excel spreadsheet referenced in the 
cover letter to assist in your review of the materials from the SUPP production. 
Please let us know if you have any further questions regarding the SUPP production or if you have any difficulty accessing 
the materials.

Also following up on your response to Chris. We have had a chance to take a look at these files again. 
For the SUPP production, many of the files were produced as PDFs, which seems as though they were converted prior to 
production. As I understand it (which is admittedly limited), carved or deleted files can still contain application metadata. 
We request that as to the SUPP production, you: 
a. Provide a list of all files that were carved or deleted; 
b. Confirm if all those files were produced in native format or if any were converted to PDF; 
c. If any were converted, provide additional information including the MIME type (for all), and if available from 
application metadata original file name, file dates, etc. This would amount to the equivalent of the index you provided for 
SDNY011. 
d. In the absence of (b), confirm that no application metadata was recovered from those files which might indicate file 
creation/modified dates 
Please let me know if you have any questions. 
Thanks, 
Laura

Subject: RE: Discovery Issues 
Chris, 
Following up on these issues: 
• For #3, the attachments were not recovered from the searched devices. We do not have them, which is why they 
were not produced. 
• For #4, the electronic files recovered from Epstein's devices have the same metadata on the hard drive that was 
available when the FBI seized each file. For files that were carved or deleted, no metadata was recovered, so none 
is viewable, except for data showing when a particular file was saved to a drive by the investigative team or 
prepared for production. I am not aware of any additional metadata in our possession that you do not have for 
these files. 
• For #5, those photographs were not processed by CART, which is why they do not have a CART number. They came 
from the CDs that your team reviewed last week. The available metadata for those photographs was produced in 
two excel spreadsheets with the same production — one with metadata for nude images (which were contained on 
one of the hard drives you reviewed last week), and one with metadata for non-nude images (which were 
produced in the November 9, 2020 discovery production). As I mentioned in my email to Laura earlier today, I am 
working with our vendor to figure out how to best convey to you which Bates numbers correspond with which rows 
in the spreadsheet. 
• For #6: 
o The SDNY_GM_SUPP contain electronic files recovered from Epstein's devices. As noted above, those files 
have the same metadata on the hard drive that was available when the FBI seized each file. For files that 
were carved or deleted, no metadata was recovered, so none is viewable. 
o The videos from SDNY005 (October 20, 2020 production) were converted by a vendor from VHS and cassette 
tapes, so there is no metadata to provide. The Sept-Octo 2020 dates reflect when these recordings were 
converted by our vendor. 
o The SDNY011 (November 9, 2020 production) consists of images from the CDs seized from Epstein's 
residences, which you reviewed last week. As referenced above, those photographs were not processed by 
CART, which is why they do not have a CART number. As referenced above, the available metadata for those 
photographs was produced in two excel spreadsheets with the same production — one with metadata for 
nude images (which were contained on one of the hard drives you reviewed last week), and one with 
metadata for non-nude images (which were produced in the November 9, 2020 discovery production). As I 
mentioned in my email to Laura earlier today, I am working with our vendor to figure out how to best convey 
to you which Bates numbers correspond with which rows in the spreadsheet.

Apologies for the late response on this. It seems like it would be better to confer after you have heard back from your 
vendor, since the answers to #3-#6 will depend on what the vendor says. And I believe we have now resolved #7. 
As for #1 and #2, I will call 
at MDC and represent to her that we have your concurrence to send the 
drive directly to Ms. Maxwell. If she agrees, we can add the additional productions to our drive before we send it. If she 
refuses, we will take it up with Judge Nathan.

Chris, 
We are available for a call to discuss tomorrow between 1pm and 2pm, between 3pm and 5pm, or after 5:30pm. Please 
let us know if there is a time in those windows that would work on your end. In the meantime, below are some initial 
responses: 
1. Our supervisors have indicated that we are not permitted to send a drive that our IT department did not load to 
the MDC. As a result, we cannot provide the drive directly to the MDC. That said, I am happy to join you in asking 
the MDC to accept the drive from you. If the MDC still refuses, then my office would not object to an application to 
Judge Nathan for an order directing the MDC to accept the drive from you, though we would need to allow MDC 
legal counsel the opportunity to note their objections to Judge Nathan. 
2. The MDC recently alerted us to this issue, and our paralegal converted the excel files at issue to pdfs and sent a 
new CD with those pdfs to the MDC. If you client still cannot view them, then we are happy to load them to a drive 
if you would like to provide one for us. 
3. I have asked our vendor to look into this issue and will get back to you when I have spoken with them. 
4. I have asked our vendor to look into this issue and will get back to you when I have spoken with them. That said, 
similar to the note I sent in my email regarding highly confidential images on March 16, 2021, the electronic files 
recovered from Epstein's devices have the same metadata on the hard drive that was available when the FBI seized 
each file. For files that were carved or deleted, no metadata was recovered, so none is viewable, except for data 
showing when a particular file was saved to a drive by the investigative team or prepared for production. 
5. As indicated in our November 9, 2020 discovery letter, all images within Bates range SDNY_GM_00467566 though 
SDNY_GM_00514100 were seized during the 2019 searches of Epstein residences. These are the images from the 
CDs that were recovered during those searches, so they did not come from any of the electronic devices that were 
the subject of extractions by CART. As a result, these images would not have CART numbers. As for the metadata, I 
have asked our vendor to look into this issue and will get back to you when I have spoken with them. 
6. I have asked our vendor to look into this issue and will get back to you when I have spoken with them. That said, I 
note again that the electronic files recovered from Epstein's devices have the same metadata on the hard drive that 
was available when the FBI seized each file. For files that were carved or deleted, no metadata was recovered, so 
none is viewable. Additionally, as indicated in our November 9, 2020 discovery letter, all images within the 
SDNY011 load file (Bates range SDNY_GM_00467566 though SDNY_GM_00514100) were seized during the 2019 
searches of Epstein residences. These are the images from the CDs that were recovered during those searches, so 
they did not come from any of the electronic devices that were the subject of extractions by CART. As a result, 
these images would not have CART numbers. 
7. I have asked our paralegals and vendor to look into the Bates gap and will get back to you when I have spoken to 
them.

We write to raise a few issues concerning the discovery. Below is the list of items. Please let me know if you are free for a 
call to discuss. 
1. On our last call, we asked you if we could send our client a hard drive containing the discovery that we had created 
(without the highly confidential items). You had said you would check to see if you could facilitate this. We have 
not heard back from you. Are you able to send Ms. Maxwell the hard drive? 
2. The last two productions you sent to Ms. Maxwell on disks. As you know, she cannot read disks on her laptop and 
must use the prison computer. But the prison computer cannot read some of the files. We can include these files 
on our hard drive to send to Ms. Maxwell. Otherwise, you will need to produce them on a hard drive. Please 
advise which way you would like to proceed. 
3. A number of the emails in the discovery — over 109,000 — were produced without their attachments (see tab 1 of 
the attached Excel file). Instead, the attachments appear as slip-sheets (see example attached). Please provide the 
missing attachments, if they exist. 
4. A number of electronic documents — over 110,000 — that were extracted from one of Epstein's devices, as identified 
by a CART number, have metadata that indicates a "date created" or "date last modified" date in July 2020 or 
afterwards (see tab 2 of the attached Excel file). We request that you produce a metadata overlay with the original 
metadata for these files. 
5. A number of photographs — over 6500 — were produced in native format, but do not have a CART number and have 
"date created" and/or "date last modified" dates after July 2019 (see tab 3 of the attached Excel file). Please 
provide the CART number for these photographs or specify which device they came from. Also, we request that 
you produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files. 
6. A number of the audio/visual files — over 460 — have similar metadata issues (see tab 4 of the attached Excel file). 
These fall into the following buckets: 
a. SDNY GM SUPP: these have CART numbers, but were produced without metadata load files and have 
"date created" and "date last modified" dates in September-November 2020, after the date the device was 
seized. We request that you produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files. 
b. SDNY005 (October 20 2020 production): these are a few videos from the SDFL or PBPD investigations that 
were produced in native form without metadata load files. They have Sept-Oct 2020 dates. We request that 
you produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files. 
EFTA00028576
--- PAGE 7 ---
c. SDNY011 (November 9 2020 production): these were produced in native form with load files, but do not 
reference a CART number and have Sept 2020 dates. We request that you provide a CART number for these 
files or indicate their source. Also, we request that you produce a metadata overlay with the original 
metadata for these files. 
7. There is a gap between 11/18 and 12/18 production numbers (SDNY_GM_02742044 to 2742183). Was that 
intentional or are we missing those documents? 
Please let us know your responses as soon as possible.

Hi M, 
Per our conversation just now, attached is a draft of the letter we intend to submit shortly. As you'll see in the first bullet 
point, we reference the Dal-OIG review. We do not plan to make mention of a report, although if asked at a court 
conference whether there will be a report, we plan to say that we don't know, and that OIG's normal process is to prepare 
a report but we don't know whether it will be made public or not. 
Please let us know if you have any objections to the language in the letter. Thanks again for the speedy response, we very 
much appreciate it.

Hi

--- PAGE 2 ---
We were hoping you could assist us with getting in touch with the OIG lawyer who is responsible for preparing the report 
on Epstein's suicide. We have been trying to get in touch with 
. who was previously handling the 
investigation, but understand he may have left the office. The time sensitivity is that we plan to file a public letter by close 
of business today regarding reaching a deferred prosecution agreement with the two guards on duty that night who have 
been charged with falsifying records. The guards have agreed to sit for an interview with our office and DOJ-OIG, and 
we'd like to state in the letter that the interviews would occur as part of an ongoing OIG investigation that we expect 
would lead to a public report. However, we don't want to make this representation unless D0J-OIG is comfortable with it. 
I'm happy to discuss by phone if convenient. 
Thanks very much,

Re: 
United States v. Noel and Thomas, 19 Cr. 830 (AT) 
Dear Judge Tones: 
The Government submits this letter to inform the Court that the parties have entered into 
deferred prosecution agreements (the "Agreements"), which have been approved by Pretrial 
Services and are included for the Court's consideration.' After a thorough investigation, and based 
on the facts of this case and the personal circumstances of the defendants, the Government has 
determined that the interests of justice will best be served by deferring prosecution in this District. 
The proposed Agreements contemplate an additional six-month term of supervision by Pretrial 
Services and, in addition to the standard terms of pretrial supervision, the proposed Agreements 
include the additional salient terms: 
• 
The defendants will cooperate with a pending Department of Justice Office of Inspector 
General review by providing truthful information related to their employment by the 
Bureau of Prisons, including about the events and circumstances described in the 
Indictment; and 
• 
The defendants will complete 100 hours of community service, preferably in an area related 
to the criminal justice system. 
The defendants have consented to the entry of the Agreements and have also admitted that 
they "willfully and knowingly completed materially false count and round slips regarding required 
counts and rounds in the Special Housing Unit of the Metropolitan Correctional Center on August 
9, 2019 and August 10, 2019." 
The Government respectfully requests, with the consent of the defendants, through counsel, 
that the Court schedule a hearing date for entry of the Agreements. Having conferred with defense 
' As the deferred prosecution agreements are not final until they are approved by the Court, the 
Government has not filed them publicly with this letter.

Dear Judge Nathan, 
Attached is the Government's memorandum of law in opposition to the defendant's supplemental pretrial motions. The 
Government is not seeking redactions to the memorandum. However, the electronic case filing system does not accept 
the filing of opposition briefs where the original motion does not appear on the docket, and the defense motion has not

filed.

Also following up on your response to Chris. We have had a chance to take a look at these files again. 
EFTA00028585
--- PAGE 2 ---
For the SUPP production, many of the files were produced as PDFs, which seems as though they were converted prior to 
production. As I understand it (which is admittedly limited), carved or deleted files can still contain application 
metadata. 
We request that as to the SUPP production, you: 
a. Provide a list of all files that were carved or deleted; 
b. Confirm if all those files were produced in native format or if any were converted to PDF; 
c. If any were converted, provide additional information including the MIME type (for all), and if available from 
application metadata original file name, file dates, etc. This would amount to the equivalent of the index you provided 
for SDNY011. 
d. In the absence of (b), confirm that no application metadata was recovered from those files which might indicate file 
creation/modified dates 
Please let me know if you have any questions. 
Thanks, 
Laura

Chris, 
Following up on these issues: 
• For #3, the attachments were not recovered from the searched devices. We do not have them, which is why they 
were not produced. 
• For #4, the electronic files recovered from Epstein's devices have the same metadata on the hard drive that was 
available when the FBI seized each file. For files that were carved or deleted, no metadata was recovered, so 
none is viewable, except for data showing when a particular file was saved to a drive by the investigative team or 
prepared for production. I am not aware of any additional metadata in our possession that you do not have for 
these files. 
• For #5, those photographs were not processed by CART, which is why they do not have a CART number. They 
came from the CDs that your team reviewed last week. The available metadata for those photographs was 
produced in two excel spreadsheets with the same production — one with metadata for nude images (which were 
contained on one of the hard drives you reviewed last week), and one with metadata for non-nude images (which 
were produced in the November 9, 2020 discovery production). As I mentioned in my email to Laura earlier 
today, I am working with our vendor to figure out how to best convey to you which Bates numbers correspond 
with which rows in the spreadsheet. 
• For #6: 
EFTA00028586
--- PAGE 3 ---
o The SDNY_GM_SUPP contain electronic files recovered from Epstein's devices. As noted above, those files 
have the same metadata on the hard drive that was available when the FBI seized each file. For files that 
were carved or deleted, no metadata was recovered, so none is viewable. 
o The videos from SDNY005 (October 20, 2020 production) were converted by a vendor from VHS and 
cassette tapes, so there is no metadata to provide. The Sept-Octo 2020 dates reflect when these 
recordings were converted by our vendor. 
o The SDNY011 (November 9, 2020 production) consists of images from the CDs seized from Epstein's 
residences, which you reviewed last week. As referenced above, those photographs were not processed 
by CART, which is why they do not have a CART number. As referenced above, the available metadata for 
those photographs was produced in two excel spreadsheets with the same production — one with 
metadata for nude images (which were contained on one of the hard drives you reviewed last week), and

Apologies for the late response on this. It seems like it would be better to confer after you have heard back from your 
vendor, since the answers to #3-#6 will depend on what the vendor says. And I believe we have now resolved #7. 
As for #1 and #2, I will cal 
at MDC and represent to her that we have your concurrence to send the 
drive directly to Ms. Maxwell. If she agrees, we can add the additional productions to our drive before we send it. If she 
refuses, we will take it up with Judge Nathan.

Chris, 
We are available for a call to discuss tomorrow between 1pm and 2pm, between 3pm and 5pm, or after 5:30pm. Please 
let us know if there is a time in those windows that would work on your end. In the meantime, below are some initial 
responses: 
1. Our supervisors have indicated that we are not permitted to send a drive that our IT department did not load to 
the MDC. As a result, we cannot provide the drive directly to the MDC. That said, I am happy to join you in 
asking the MDC to accept the drive from you. If the MDC still refuses, then my office would not object to an 
application to Judge Nathan for an order directing the MDC to accept the drive from you, though we would need 
to allow MDC legal counsel the opportunity to note their objections to Judge Nathan. 
2. The MDC recently alerted us to this issue, and our paralegal converted the excel files at issue to pdfs and sent a 
new CD with those pdfs to the MDC. If you client still cannot view them, then we are happy to load them to a 
drive if you would like to provide one for us. 
3. I have asked our vendor to look into this issue and will get back to you when I have spoken with them. 
4. I have asked our vendor to look into this issue and will get back to you when I have spoken with them. That said, 
similar to the note I sent in my email regarding highly confidential images on March 16, 2021, the electronic files 
recovered from Epstein's devices have the same metadata on the hard drive that was available when the FBI 
seized each file. For files that were carved or deleted, no metadata was recovered, so none is viewable, except 
for data showing when a particular file was saved to a drive by the investigative team or prepared for production. 
EFTA00028588
--- PAGE 5 ---
5. As indicated in our November 9, 2020 discovery letter, all images within Bates range SDNY_GM_00467566 though 
SDNY_GM_00514100 were seized during the 2019 searches of Epstein residences. These are the images from the 
CDs that were recovered during those searches, so they did not come from any of the electronic devices that 
were the subject of extractions by CART. As a result, these images would not have CART numbers. As for the 
metadata, I have asked our vendor to look into this issue and will get back to you when I have spoken with them. 
6.1 have asked our vendor to look into this issue and will get back to you when I have spoken with them. That said, I 
note again that the electronic files recovered from Epstein's devices have the same metadata on the hard drive 
that was available when the FBI seized each file. For files that were carved or deleted, no metadata was 
recovered, so none is viewable. Additionally, as indicated in our November 9, 2020 discovery letter, all images 
within the SDNY011 load file (Bates range SDNY_GM_00467566 though SDNY_GM_00514100) were seized during 
the 2019 searches of Epstein residences. These are the images from the CDs that were recovered during those 
searches, so they did not come from any of the electronic devices that were the subject of extractions by CART. 
As a result, these images would not have CART numbers.

We write to raise a few issues concerning the discovery. Below is the list of items. Please let me know if you are free for 
a call to discuss. 
1. On our last call, we asked you if we could send our client a hard drive containing the discovery that we had 
created (without the highly confidential items). You had said you would check to see if you could facilitate this. 
We have not heard back from you. Are you able to send Ms. Maxwell the hard drive? 
2. The last two productions you sent to Ms. Maxwell on disks. As you know, she cannot read disks on her laptop and 
must use the prison computer. But the prison computer cannot read some of the files. We can include these files 
on our hard drive to send to Ms. Maxwell. Otherwise, you will need to produce them on a hard drive. Please 
advise which way you would like to proceed. 
EFTA00028589

3. A number of the emails in the discovery — over 109,000 — were produced without their attachments (see tab 1 of 
the attached Excel file). Instead, the attachments appear as slip-sheets (see example attached). Please provide 
the missing attachments, if they exist. 
4. A number of electronic documents — over 110,000 — that were extracted from one of Epstein's devices, as 
identified by a CART number, have metadata that indicates a "date created" or "date last modified" date in July 
2020 or afterwards (see tab 2 of the attached Excel file). We request that you produce a metadata overlay with 
the original metadata for these files. 
5. A number of photographs — over 6500 — were produced in native format, but do not have a CART number and 
have "date created" and/or "date last modified" dates after July 2019 (see tab 3 of the attached Excel file). Please 
provide the CART number for these photographs or specify which device they came from. Also, we request that 
you produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files. 
6. A number of the audio/visual files — over 460 — have similar metadata issues (see tab 4 of the attached Excel file). 
These fall into the following buckets: 
a. SDNY GM SUPP: these have CART numbers, but were produced without metadata load files and have 
"date created" and "date last modified" dates in September-November 2020, after the date the device was 
seized. We request that you produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files. 
b. SDNY005 (October 20 2020 production): these are a few videos from the SDFL or PBPD investigations that 
were produced in native form without metadata load files. They have Sept-Oct 2020 dates. We request 
that you produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files. 
c. SDNY011 (November 9 2020 production): these were produced in native form with load files, but do not 
reference a CART number and have Sept 2020 dates. We request that you provide a CART number for 
these files or indicate their source. Also, we request that you produce a metadata overlay with the original 
metadata for these files. 
7. There is a gap between 11/18 and 12/18 production numbers (SDNY_GM_02742044 to 2742183). Was that 
intentional or are we missing those documents? 
Please let us know your responses as soon as possible.

Just confirming receipt. Also, I'm hopeful that we can have everything gathered by April 12th. However, I'll be out of the 
office for the next week so it might be delayed. Will that be a problem? 
In addition, and just for confirmation's sake, you are ok that we will make reasonable efforts to notify the 
parents/students of the subpoena prior to compliance with the subpoena correct?

I apologize about not getting back with you. I thought the other attorney that filed the response was going to do so. 
Regardless, the response included everything that Interlochen has. They only keep tuition payment information for 7 
years and nothing in their files reflects any payments by Epstein or Epstein entities.

Thank you both very much for your assistance in response to our subpoenas seeking records from Interlochen. In 
reviewing the documents you produced in response to the attached subpoena, a follow-up question arose. Would 
you please confirm that your production included all records of any tuition payments that Epstein (or his entities) 
made for any students at Interlochen? 
Our team is also happy to discuss this inquiry over the phone if that would be useful. I am starting a trial tomorrow

Hi 
Just confirming receipt. Also, I'm hopeful that we can have everything gathered by April 12th. However, I'll be out of the 
office for the next week so it might be delayed. Will that be a problem? 
In addition, and just for confirmation's sake, you are ok that we will make reasonable efforts to notify the 
parents/students of the subpoena prior to compliance with the subpoena correct? 
Thanks,

I apologize about not getting back with you. I thought the other attorney that filed the response was going to do so. 
Regardless, the response included everything that Interlochen has. They only keep tuition payment information for 7 
years and nothing in their files reflects any payments by Epstein or Epstein entities.

Jeff and George, 
Thank you both very much for your assistance in response to our subpoenas seeking records from Interlochen. In 
reviewing the documents you produced in response to the attached subpoena, a follow-up question arose. Would 
you please confirm that your production included all records of any tuition payments that Epstein (or his entities) 
made for any students at Interlochen? 
Our team is also happy to discuss this inquiry over the phone if that would be useful. I am starting a trial tomorrow 
and will have limited availability this week, but my colleagues

Joe, 
We just wanted to check in very briefly—we had been hopeful that we'd be able to circle back with you earlier, but 
our investigation is currently still ongoing, so at the very least we wanted to let you know that we continue to 
appreciate both your client's prior assistance and her willingness to assist in the future. Nothing in our 
investigation since we were last substantively in touch has changed our view of your client, and we hope to be able 
to be in touch with you in the coming weeks with an update. In the interim, we do continue to view her status as 
we've previously conveyed, and please let us know if any issues arise on your end. 
thank you,

As we start thinking about scheduling a next meeting with 
we were wondering if you 
could please let us know if there are any particular weeks that would not work for you or your client 
for a meeting in Florida (in particular, we don't want to interfere with anyone's summer vacation

We will of course be in touch to talk about a next meeting in more detail, but in the first instance it

OF ER GREEMENT 
With respect to the meeting of 
") 
oseph 
Nascimento, Esq., with Assistant United States Attorneys 
and
 to be 
held on July 12, 2019 ("the meeting"), the following understandings exist: 
(I) THIS IS NOT A COOPERATION AGREEMENT. The Client has agreed to 
provide the Government with information, and to respond to questions, so that the Government 
may evaluate Client's information and responses in making prosecutive decisions. By receiving 
Client's proffer, the Government does not agree to make a motion on the Client's behalf or to enter 
into a cooperation agreement, plea agreement, immunity or non-prosecution agreement. The 
Government makes no representation about the likelihood that any such agreement will be reached 
in connection with this proffer. 
(2) In any prosecution brought against Client by this Office, except as provided below the 
Government will not offer in evidence on its case-in-chief, or in connection with any sentencing 
proceeding for the purpose of determining an appropriate sentence, any statements made by Client 
at the meeting, except (a) in a prosecution for false statements, obstruction of justice or perjury 
with respect to any acts committed or statements made during or after the meeting or testimony 
given after the meeting; or (b) if, at any time following the meeting, Client becomes a fugitive 
from justice. 
(3) Notwithstanding item (2) above: (a) the Government may use information derived 
directly or indirectly from the meeting for the purpose of obtaining leads to other evidence, which 
evidence may be used in any prosecution of Client by the Government; (b) in any prosecution 
brought against Client, the Government may use statements made by Client at the meeting and all 
evidence obtained directly or indirectly therefrom for the purpose of cross-examination should 
Client testify; and (c) the Government may also use statements made by Client at the meeting to 
rebut any evidence or arguments offered by or on behalf of Client (including arguments made or 
issues raised sua snonte by the District Court) at any stage of the criminal prosecution (including 
bail, all phases of trial, and sentencing) in any prosecution brought against Client. 
(4) The Client understands and agrees that in the event the Client seeks to qualify for a 
Suction in sentence under Title 18, United States Code, Section 3553(1), United States 
Sentencing Guidelines, Sections 2D1.1 (b)(18) or 5C1.2, or Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(b), the Office may 
offer or use at any stage of the criminal proceeding any statement made by Client during the 
meeting, and all evidence obtained directly or indirectly therefrom, to the extent such use is 
consistent with Section 402 of the First Step Act of 2018. 
(5) To the extent that the Government is entitled under this Agreement to offer in evidence 
any statements made by Client or leads obtained therefrom, Client shall assert no claim under the 
United States Constitution, any statute, Rule 410 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, or any other 
federal rule that such statements or any leads therefrom should be suppressed. It is the intent of 
this Agreement to waive all rights in the foregoing respects. 
01.142019 
EFTA00028641
--- PAGE 2 ---
(6) If this Office receives a request from another prosecutor's office for access to 
information obtained pursuant to this Proffer Agreement, this Office may furnish such information 
but will do so only on the condition that the requesting office honor the provisions of this 
Agreement. 
(7) It is further understood that this Agreement is limited to the statements made by Client 
at the meeting and does not apply to any oral, written or recorded statements made by Client at 
any other time. No understandings, promises, agreements and/or conditions have been entered 
into with respect to the meeting other than those set forth in this Agreement and none will be 
entered into unless in writing and signed by all parties. 
(8) The understandings set forth in paragraphs I through 7 above extend to the continuation 
of this meeting on the dates that appear below. 
(9) Client and Attorney acknowledge that they have fully discussed and understand every 
paragraph and clause in this Agreement and the consequences thereof.

After the Circuit rejected her prior bail appeal, Maxwell filed the attached "renewed motion" in the Circuit in the same 
docket. Can anyone think of a reason she can't do that? Even if it's not procedurally proper, it probably doesn't get us 
much, as she could just file a new notice of appeal from AJN's latest order and then file the same motion in the Circuit...

Counsel, 
Today we have an additional discovery production ready to send to you. This production is small enough to produce via 
USAfx. Please let us know if you do not already have a USAfx account, in which case our paralegals (cc'd) can assist you in 
creating an account. We are also sending a CD containing this production to the MDC via FedEx. 
Attached please find a cover letter accompanying this production. As you will see in the letter, the majority of this 
production consists of materials we are providing in response to your requests for additional information regarding the 
SUPP production (referenced in the below email exchange). I am also attaching the excel spreadsheet referenced in the 
cover letter to assist in your review of the materials from the SUPP production. 
Please let us know if you have any further questions regarding the SUPP production or if you have any difficulty accessing 
the materials.

Also following up on your response to Chris. We have had a chance to take a look at these files again. 
For the SUPP production, many of the files were produced as PDFs, which seems as though they were converted prior to 
production. As I understand it (which is admittedly limited), carved or deleted files can still contain application metadata. 
We request that as to the SUPP production, you: 
a. Provide a list of all files that were carved or deleted; 
b. Confirm if all those files were produced in native format or if any were converted to PDF; 
c. If any were converted, provide additional information including the MIME type (for all), and if available from 
application metadata original file name, file dates, etc. This would amount to the equivalent of the index you provided for 
SDNY011. 
d. In the absence of (b), confirm that no application metadata was recovered from those files which might indicate file 
creation/modified dates 
Please let me know if you have any questions. 
Thanks, 
Laura

• For #3, the attachments were not recovered from the searched devices. We do not have them, which is why they 
were not produced. 
• For #4, the electronic files recovered from Epstein's devices have the same metadata on the hard drive that was 
available when the FBI seized each file. For files that were carved or deleted, no metadata was recovered, so none 
is viewable, except for data showing when a particular file was saved to a drive by the investigative team or 
prepared for production. I am not aware of any additional metadata in our possession that you do not have for 
these files. 
• For #5, those photographs were not processed by CART, which is why they do not have a CART number. They came 
from the CDs that your team reviewed last week. The available metadata for those photographs was produced in 
two excel spreadsheets with the same production — one with metadata for nude images (which were contained on 
one of the hard drives you reviewed last week), and one with metadata for non-nude images (which were 
produced in the November 9, 2020 discovery production). As I mentioned in my email to Laura earlier today, I am 
EFTA00028648
--- PAGE 4 ---
working with our vendor to figure out how to best convey to you which Bates numbers correspond with which rows 
in the spreadsheet. 
• For #6: 
o The SDNY_GM_SUPP contain electronic files recovered from Epstein's devices. As noted above, those files 
have the same metadata on the hard drive that was available when the FBI seized each file. For files that 
were carved or deleted, no metadata was recovered, so none is viewable. 
o The videos from SDNY005 (October 20, 2020 production) were converted by a vendor from VHS and cassette 
tapes, so there is no metadata to provide. The Sept-Octo 2020 dates reflect when these recordings were 
converted by our vendor. 
o The SDNY011 (November 9, 2020 production) consists of images from the CDs seized from Epstein's 
residences, which you reviewed last week. As referenced above, those photographs were not processed by 
CART, which is why they do not have a CART number. As referenced above, the available metadata for those 
photographs was produced in two excel spreadsheets with the same production — one with metadata for 
nude images (which were contained on one of the hard drives you reviewed last week), and one with 
metadata for non-nude images (which were produced in the November 9, 2020 discovery production). As I

Apologies for the late response on this. It seems like it would be better to confer after you have heard back from your 
vendor, since the answers to #346 will depend on what the vendor says. And I believe we have now resolved #7. 
As for #1 and #2, I will call a 
MDC and represent to her that we have your concurrence to send the 
drive directly to Ms. Maxwell. If she agrees, we can add the additional productions to our drive before we send it. If she 
refuses, we will take it up with Judge Nathan. 
Thanks,

Chris, 
We are available for a call to discuss tomorrow between 1pm and 2pm, between 3pm and 5pm, or after 5:30pm. Please 
let us know if there is a time in those windows that would work on your end. In the meantime, below are some initial 
responses: 
1. Our supervisors have indicated that we are not permitted to send a drive that our IT department did not load to 
the MDC. As a result, we cannot provide the drive directly to the MDC. That said, I am happy to join you in asking 
the MDC to accept the drive from you. If the MDC still refuses, then my office would not object to an application to 
Judge Nathan for an order directing the MDC to accept the drive from you, though we would need to allow MDC 
legal counsel the opportunity to note their objections to Judge Nathan. 
2. The MDC recently alerted us to this issue, and our paralegal converted the excel files at issue to pdfs and sent a 
new CD with those pdfs to the MDC. If you client still cannot view them, then we are happy to load them to a drive 
if you would like to provide one for us. 
3. I have asked our vendor to look into this issue and will get back to you when I have spoken with them. 
4. I have asked our vendor to look into this issue and will get back to you when I have spoken with them. That said, 
similar to the note I sent in my email regarding highly confidential images on March 16, 2021, the electronic files 
EFTA00028650
--- PAGE 6 ---
recovered from Epstein's devices have the same metadata on the hard drive that was available when the FBI seized 
each file. For files that were carved or deleted, no metadata was recovered, so none is viewable, except for data 
showing when a particular file was saved to a drive by the investigative team or prepared for production. 
5. As indicated in our November 9, 2020 discovery letter, all images within Bates range SDNY_GM_00467566 though 
SDNY_GM_00514100 were seized during the 2019 searches of Epstein residences. These are the images from the 
CDs that were recovered during those searches, so they did not come from any of the electronic devices that were 
the subject of extractions by CART. As a result, these images would not have CART numbers. As for the metadata, I 
have asked our vendor to look into this issue and will get back to you when I have spoken with them. 
6. I have asked our vendor to look into this issue and will get back to you when I have spoken with them. That said, I 
note again that the electronic files recovered from Epstein's devices have the same metadata on the hard drive that 
was available when the FBI seized each file. For files that were carved or deleted, no metadata was recovered, so 
none is viewable. Additionally, as indicated in our November 9, 2020 discovery letter, all images within the 
SDNY011 load file (Bates range SDNY_GM_00467566 though SDNY_GM_00514100) were seized during the 2019 
searches of Epstein residences. These are the images from the CDs that were recovered during those searches, so 
they did not come from any of the electronic devices that were the subject of extractions by CART. As a result, 
these images would not have CART numbers. 
7. I have asked our paralegals and vendor to look into the Bates gap and will get back to you when I have spoken to 
them.

We write to raise a few issues concerning the discovery. Below is the list of items. Please let me know if you are free for a 
call to discuss. 
1. On our last call, we asked you if we could send our client a hard drive containing the discovery that we had created 
(without the highly confidential items). You had said you would check to see if you could facilitate this. We have 
not heard back from you. Are you able to send Ms. Maxwell the hard drive? 
EFTA00028651
--- PAGE 7 ---
2. The last two productions you sent to Ms. Maxwell on disks. As you know, she cannot read disks on her laptop and 
must use the prison computer. But the prison computer cannot read some of the files. We can include these files 
on our hard drive to send to Ms. Maxwell. Otherwise, you will need to produce them on a hard drive. Please 
advise which way you would like to proceed. 
3. A number of the emails in the discovery — over 109,000 — were produced without their attachments (see tab 1 of 
the attached Excel file). Instead, the attachments appear as slip-sheets (see example attached). Please provide the 
missing attachments, if they exist. 
4. A number of electronic documents — over 110,000 — that were extracted from one of Epstein's devices, as identified 
by a CART number, have metadata that indicates a "date created" or "date last modified" date in July 2020 or 
afterwards (see tab 2 of the attached Excel file). We request that you produce a metadata overlay with the original 
metadata for these files. 
5. A number of photographs — over 6500 — were produced in native format, but do not have a CART number and have 
"date created" and/or "date last modified" dates after July 2019 (see tab 3 of the attached Excel file). Please 
provide the CART number for these photographs or specify which device they came from. Also, we request that 
you produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files. 
6. A number of the audio/visual files — over 460 — have similar metadata issues (see tab 4 of the attached Excel file). 
These fall into the following buckets: 
a. SDNY GM SUPP: these have CART numbers, but were produced without metadata load files and have 
"date created" and "date last modified" dates in September-November 2020, after the date the device was 
seized. We request that you produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files. 
b. SDNY005 (October 20 2020 production): these are a few videos from the SDFL or PBPD investigations that 
were produced in native form without metadata load files. They have Sept-Oct 2020 dates. We request that 
you produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files. 
c. SDNY011 (November 9 2020 production): these were produced in native form with load files, but do not 
reference a CART number and have Sept 2020 dates. We request that you provide a CART number for these 
files or indicate their source. Also, we request that you produce a metadata overlay with the original 
metadata for these files. 
7. There is a gap between 11/18 and 12/18 production numbers (SDNY_GM_02742044 to 2742183). Was that 
intentional or are we missing those documents? 
Please let us know your responses as soon as possible. 
Thanks, 
Chris

Hi 
I have a trip scheduled for this week that just got final approval late Friday night, so I made reservations on E2 this 
weekend and wanted to let you know in case you need to do things for authorization and/or if you want to consolidate 
the reservations (unfortunately I couldn't figure out how to do everything together so ended up with three different 
reservations—I'm sorry about that!). 
Because I had a previously-scheduled trip to San Francisco on this Thursday, • approved my second leg flight to go 
straight there (rather than coming back to NYC). The reservations I made are: 
Tuesday, May 28, flight from LGA to PBI 
- 
JetBlue, departing 1:27 p.m. (arriving 4:25 p.m.) 
Tuesday, May 28, hotel in West Palm Beach 
- 
Hilton West Palm Beach, from May 28 to May 30 
Thursday, May 30, flight from PBI to SFO (with layover in ATL) 
- 
Delta, departing 5:30 a.m. (arriving ATL at 7:12 a.m., departing ATL at 8:10 a.m.) arriving SFO at 10:22 a.m. 
If these need to be canceled and re-booked as one itinerary, that's totally fine, I just didn't want to wait until the day 
before to at least make the reservations. 
Last question is, I had to cancel my New York to San Francisco flight previously scheduled for Thursday morning (because 
there were no flights late enough to be after our final interviews in Florida on Wednesday, or early enough to get me back 
EFTA00028656
--- PAGE 3 ---
to New York on Thursday) which incurred a $100 cancellation fee. Is it possible to be reimbursed for that? 
Please let me know if any questions at all, apologies again for any inconvenience, and thanks as always.

I think they were just asking for recommendations for reputable vendors that we have used in the past. If there are two or three that we have had 
good experiences using, in Fort Lauderdale, Miami, or wherever, I can forward that contact information and leave the rest to them to sort out. Does 
that make sense? 
Thanks for looking into this.

Subject: RE: Copy/Scan Vendors 
Currently, we do not have a contract in place for large/voluminous jobs. We use our Simplified Purchase Agreement (SPA) vendors for any job that 
can't be handled in-house. Normally, these SPA vendors don't have storage space in their facilities to hold discovery past a brief period, and the 
copy/scan jobs are small to medium. There are no restrictions for folks outside of our district on who they can use. If the request is being paid by 
another district, they are free to go wherever they like. To help with the process, I can try to find a few SPA vendors in the WPB area. Then SONY can 
call them to ask if they can handle the job; about their security (confidentiality) protocol; and pricing information. 
Another option may be to send the documents to the NOC. I don't know a lot about the process but we've used it in the past, and it's secure. If 
interested in this option, I can discuss with our in-house Graphics Dept. 
Questions: 
Is there a deadline of when the documents are to be scanned/copied? 
Are the original or copied documents going to opposing counsel to review? 
Will the vendor be required to store the documents to allow defense to view/copy?

Good Morning 
I hope all is well. 
The USAO — SDNY is requesting a list of vendors that we've used (I don't believe we have a current contract) for copying and scanning voluminous 
files/documents/cd's and cassette tapes relating to the Jeffrey Epstein case. Obviously, confidentiality and sensitivity are major concerns. 
I believe that SDNY will make the arrangements and pay for the services, but they are requesting a list of vendors that SDFL has used for these types 
of services. Since we do not have a current contract, is there policy that needs to be followed to use a company in this field? 
If memory serves me, I don't believe any of the companies were local to West Palm Beach (where the documents are being stored). I believe the 
companies were in the Fort Lauderdale and Miami area. 
Any information, assistance and guidance you can provide would be greatly appreciated. 
Thank you and take care, 
Office Manager, WPB

I just spoke with 
about this. They had originally thought the paralegals could make the copies, but they tried 
and couldn't, so they asked 
to. The CART analyst assigned to the Epstein/Maxwell case is out of the office today and 
tomorrow, and they don't have anyone else who can make copies. The discovery deadline is 11/9, but the team is asking 
the reviewers to finish by 10/31, so that they have time to review the responsiveness coding and make copies for 
production. The team is worried that if the reviewers don't start within the next day or so, they won't have enough time 
for the review. When 
spoke with =, 
he said he could get it done; we're deeply appreciative of the help and 
sorry to monopolize so many office resources in service of this discovery deadline. Happy to discuss further by phone (I'm 
available by cell anytime,

Again in connection with the Epstein investigation, we'd like to please request permission to travel for approximately 
three days next week for meetings and interviews in West Palm Beach, Florida. As of now we tentatively expect to fly 
down Tuesday night and return on Wednesday or Thursday (and will keep the timeframe as short as scheduling allows). 
Unfortunately we're still trying to pin down timing for interviewing the victims, so depending on the timing it will either 
be me and 
or 
and 
but we wanted to ask for permission now either way so we weren't doing it 
super last minute after the holiday on Tuesday. And also same as last time, we'd like to ask permission to reserve a 
conference room at the hotel for the interviews, please. 
thanks very much,

Good morning all, 
clarified that the San Francisco trip below was actually a personal trip. He is asking about receiving a credit 
card refund for cancelling his San Francisco trip due to a work-related business trip occurring the same day. Would he be 
able to receive reimbursement for the $100 cancellation fee he received? 
If possible, would I need to fill out a SF-1164 to process his reimbursement, or is there another form I would need to fill 
out? Any info on how to proceed is appreciated. Thanks as always!

Just a quick question regarding the cancelled trip for this Thursday (5/30/19). Was this trip booked through CWT by phone 
or online? If either scenario, I'll need the cancelled record locator to see if it's refundable, and ask them to send me a 
document stating it was refunded to your government travel card. Thanks.

I have a trip scheduled for this week that just got final approval late Friday night, so I made reservations on E2 this 
weekend and wanted to let you know in case you need to do things for authorization and/or if you want to consolidate 
the reservations (unfortunately I couldn't figure out how to do everything together so ended up with three different 
reservations—I'm sorry about that!). 
EFTA00028675
--- PAGE 2 ---
Because I had a previously-scheduled trip to San Francisco on this Thursday, • approved my second leg flight to go 
straight there (rather than coming back to NYC). The reservations I made are: 
Tuesday, May 28, flight from LGA to PBI 
- 
JetBlue, departing 1:27 p.m. (arriving 4:25 p.m.) 
Tuesday, May 28, hotel in West Palm Beach 
- 
Hilton West Palm Beach, from May 28 to May 30 
Thursday, May 30, flight from PBI to SFO (with layover in ATL) 
- 
Delta, departing 5:30 a.m. (arriving ATL at 7:12 a.m., departing ATL at 8:10 a.m.) arriving SFO at 10:22 a.m. 
If these need to be canceled and re-booked as one itinerary, that's totally fine, I just didn't want to wait until the day 
before to at least make the reservations. 
Last question is, I had to cancel my New York to San Francisco flight previously scheduled for Thursday morning (because 
there were no flights late enough to be after our final interviews in Florida on Wednesday, or early enough to get me back 
to New York on Thursday) which incurred a $100 cancellation fee. Is it possible to be reimbursed for that? 
Please let me know if any questions at all, apologies again for any inconvenience, and thanks as always.

asked to schedule our meetings for our Florida trip, there's no flight back to New York after we expect the interviews to 
end on Wednesday (so I couldn't get back to NYC to catch my Thursday morning flight). Is it permissible for me to just 
book the second leg of the work trip straight to San Francisco, rather than back to New York? I'd have to take a 5:30 
a.m. flight but that way we could do the interviews with all the victims we'd like to meet with. Sorry for any 
inconvenience but wanted to check —thank you!

Again in connection with the Epstein investigation, we'd like to please request permission to travel for approximately 
three days next week for meetings and interviews in West Palm Beach, Florida. As of now we tentatively expect to fly 
down Tuesday night and return on Wednesday or Thursday (and will keep the timeframe as short as scheduling 
allows). 
Unfortunately we're still trying to pin down timing for interviewing the victims, so depending on the timing it will 
either be me and 
or 
and 
but we wanted to ask for permission now either way so we weren't 
doing it super last minute after the holiday on Tuesday. And also same as last time, we'd like to ask permission to 
reserve a conference room at the hotel for the interviews, please.

Dear Ms. Strauss: 
Enclosed is the Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) Report of Investigation into 
the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida's Resolution of Its 2006-2008 
Federal Criminal Investigation of Jeffrey Epstein and Its Interactions with Victims during the 
Investigation. An Executive Summary appears at the beginning of the report. Although OPR's 
investigation did not involve your Office, we are providing you with the Report because it may be 
relevant to ongoing litigation being handled by your Office. 
In addition, because this matter has received extraordinary public attention and has been 
the subject of Congressional inquiries, the Department of Justice is today publicly releasing the 
Executive Summary. The Department does not plan to publicly release the full report at this time, 
but will provide it to Congress upon its request. Congress may choose to release the full report to 
the public. In addition, it is possible that all or parts of the report may become public through the 
processing of Freedom of Information Act requests. 
Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions about this matter. 
Sincerely, 
Enclosure

Thanks, 
The problem is the stuff that is coming today is stuff the team asked PAE to process in early September. I 
realize that this is a big project and that there's only so much that can be done, but it poses almost insurmountable timing 
hurdles for our team if it is taking 1-2 months for PAE to get us stuff we ask for out of Relativity. In most of our cases, this 
one included, that eats up a huge chunk of the time we have available to produce discovery. 
We'll follow up early next week to see if there is a more concrete update, but I think this may require a broader or higher 
level explanation to the Court. I am concerned about requiring our team to take the hit with Judge Nathan for missing this 
deadline.

Regardless, the response included everything that Interlochen has. They only keep tuition payment information for 7

Hi Jeff, 
No, I don't think you responded. Totally understandable given everything that has gone on in the last month. I'd still 
be grateful if you could get back to me on this point, please. 
Hope you are also staying safe and healthy.

Jeff and George, 
Thank you both very much for your assistance in response to our subpoenas seeking records from Interlochen. In 
reviewing the documents you produced in response to the attached subpoena, a follow-up question arose. Would you 
please confirm that your production included all records of any tuition payments that Epstein (or his entities) made for 
any students at Interlochen? 
Our team is also happy to discuss this inquiry over the phone if that would be useful. I am starting a trial tomorrow 
and will have limited availability this week, but my colleagues 
and 
(both cc'd) should be 
able to coordinate with you as needed.

We were hoping you could assist us with getting in touch with the O16 lawyer who is responsible for preparing the 
report on Epstein's suicide. We have been trying to get in touch with 
who was previously handling the 
investigation, but understand he may have left the office. The time sensitivity is that we plan to file a public letter by 
close of business today regarding reaching a deferred prosecution agreement with the two guards on duty that night 
who have been charged with falsifying records. The guards have agreed to sit for an interview with our office and DOJ-
O16, and we'd like to state in the letter that the interviews would occur as part of an ongoing OIG investigation that we 
expect would lead to a public report. However, we don't want to make this representation unless DOJ-OIG is 
comfortable with it. 
I'm happy to discuss by phone if convenient. 
Thanks very much,

Subject: RE: Epstein flight records 
Date: Wed, 08 Jan 2020 00:56:36 +0000 
For your situational awareness, wanted to let you know that the flight records we received yesterday reflect that Donald 
Trump traveled on Epstein's private jet many more times than previously has been reported (or that we were aware), 
including during the period we would expect to charge in a Maxwell case. In particular, he is listed as a passenger on at 
least eight flights between 1993 and 1996, including at least four flights on which Maxwell was also present. He is listed 
as having traveled with, among others and at various times, Marla Maples, his daughter Tiffany, and his son Eric. On one 
flight in 1993, he and Epstein are the only two listed passengers; on another, the only three passengers are Epstein, 
Trump, and then-20-year-old 
On two other flights, two of the passengers, 
respectively, were women who would be possible witnesses in a Maxwell case. We've just finished reviewing the full 
records (more than 100 pages of very small script) and didn't want any of this to be a surprise down the road.

If either of you have a moment after those meetings have concluded to provide me with a quick update, that 
would be very much appreciated.

Hello Everyone, 
Our HQ staff was contacted by the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) in association with the matters concerning the 
Epstein/MCC case, and informed that they would like to convene a Board of Inquiry that would review the operations at 
the MCC NY. I have been asked to share this with the investigative and prosecution team for opinion and consideration. I 
requested that the BOP provide us with some specific information and details about what this would include and we were 
provided with the below information and attached Program Statement. Can you all please review this information and 
then can one representative from the FBI and one representative from the U.S. Attorney's Office, SDNY, let us know your 
office's position regarding this matter? I have included SAaand 
ASAC 
of our Operations Branch 
(OPS I) in this email as they deal directly with the BOP HQ. Thank you all.

The BOP would like to convene a Board of Inquiry (relevant Program Statement attached) that would review operations 
generally at MCC New York. Among other issues, it will look at local policy and procedures related to special housing, review

camera operations, and review training and staffing issues. This will not, of course, be a misconduct investigation. Should the 
Board come across anything that appears to be new misconduct allegations, they will be reported consistent with normal 
misconduct reporting requirements. 
We are mindful of the on-going criminal investigation, and are aware that administrative charges may also arise connected to 
the criminal case. We will studiously avoid creating any sort of conflict with that case. Please let me know if you have 
additional questions or would like to discuss. Thanks in advance.

Program 
Statement 
OPI: OGC 
NUMBER: 1210.21 
DATE: 3/9/2000 
SUBJECT: Boards of Inquiry and 
Inquiry Teams 
1. PURPOSE AND SCOPE. To establish procedures for the creation 
and operations of Boards of Inquiry and Inquiry Teams to 
investigate the facts and circumstances of any incident or 
situation for such purposes as: 
# 
ascertaining and reporting facts and circumstances, 
# 
gathering and preserving evidence and records, 
# 
determining the cause or causes, and 
# 
recommending corrective steps as may be indicated in policy, 
regulation, and practice. 
Only the Director may create a Board of Inquiry, and only a 
Regional Director or Warden (with Regional Director approval) may 
create an Inquiry Team. The focus of a Board of Inquiry is to 
determine the facts of an incident the Director deems significant 
or unusual enough to warrant a special and higher level of 
review. 
When employee misconduct may have occurred, clearance must be 
received from the Chief, Office of Internal Affairs (OIA), prior 
to the appointment of any regional or local Inquiry Team. OIA 
must investigate any incident when employee misconduct may have 
occurred to ensure protection of employee rights and preservation 
of evidence. To accomplish this objective, an OIA staff member 
is to serve as a member of a Board of Inquiry when staff 
misconduct may be involved. 
Any allegations of violations of law must be reported by the 
Bureau's Office of Internal Affairs, to the Department of 
Justice, Office of the Inspector General (OIG) prior to the 
creation of a Board of Inquiry or Inquiry Team.

Inquiry reports, or portions thereof, may have to be released 
pursuant to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request or 
subpoena or produced in litigation. 
3. PROGRAM OBJECTIVES. The expected results of this program 
are: 
a. Serious incidents, allegations of significant and far-
reaching breaches of policy, and allegations of misconduct will 
be formally investigated. 
b. Recommendations for corrective measures to improve 
operations or avoid future incidents will be made. 
c. The purpose, scope, and duration of each Board or Team will 
be defined by the appointing authority. 
d. A written report containing all pertinent findings and 
recommendations will be made. 
e. Appropriate records from each Board or Team will be 
preserved. 
4. STANDARDS REFERENCED

6. RESPONSIBILITIES 
Internal Affairs, Office of (8/4/97) 
Special Investigative Supervisors Manual 
(8/1/95) 
Occupational Safety and Environmental Health 
Manual (8/16/99) 
a. Boards of Inquiry. The Director may appoint Boards of 
Inquiry to investigate appropriate significant incidents in the 
Bureau including, but not limited to: 
allegations of significant breaches of policy, or 
any other matter which reflects in a significant way 
upon the Bureau's ability to carry out its mission. 
The General Counsel may request that the Director appoint a 
Board of Inquiry to investigate incidents or allegations that are 
likely to result in litigation against the United States, the 
Bureau, or one of its employees. 
b. Regional Inquiry Teams. Regional Directors may appoint 
Inquiry Teams to investigate incidents or allegations of 
significant departure from policy or regulation within their 
jurisdictions, or in any other instance when it would be in the 
Bureau's best interest. An exception is a matter which is to be 
investigated by a Board or Team appointed at a higher level. 
Regional Counsel may request that the Regional Director appoint 
an Inquiry Team to investigate incidents or allegations that are 
likely to result in litigation against a Bureau institution or 
employee under regional jurisdiction. 
c. Local Inquiry Teams. Wardens, with the approval of the 
Regional Director, may appoint a local Inquiry Team to 
investigate incidents or allegations of significant departure 
from policy or regulation at only that institution. For more 
routine incidents requiring investigation, the Warden may not 
appoint an Inquiry Team, but should assign staff such as an 
Associate Warden, appropriate department head, or investigative 
officer to investigate routine matters. 
7. APPOINTMENT OF BOARDS AND TEAMS. The Director, Regional 
Director, or Warden will notify in writing each person appointed 
to serve as a member of the Board or Team as to: 
EFTA00028725
--- PAGE 4 ---
PS 1210.21 
3/9/2000 
Page 4 
# 
the purpose and scope of the inquiry, 
# 
the date the inquiry is to begin, and 
# 
if appropriate, the date that a completed report is to be 
furnished to the appointing official. 
The written notification will indicate which member is to chair 
the Board or Team. 
The General Counsel or Regional Counsel will be consulted prior 
to the creation of a Board or Team to determine whether the 
appropriate legal office should initiate a request that a Board 
or Team be appointed. Boards and Teams appointed at the request 
of the General Counsel or Regional Counsel will include at least 
one legal staff member. 
a. Boards of Inquiry. In addition to Bureau staff, a Board of 
Inquiry may also include non-Bureau personnel with expertise 
relevant to the scope and purpose of the inquiry. An OIA staff 
member is to serve as a member of a Board of Inquiry when staff 
misconduct may be involved. The OIA will pay all expenses 
incidental and necessary to the work of a Board of Inquiry. 
b. Regional Inquiry Teams. To ensure objectivity, a regional 
Inquiry Team should not consist of staff from only one 
institution. The Team must be composed of personnel at the 
department head level or above from any institution, any regional 
office, or the Central Office. The regional office will bear all 
expenses incurred (such as for travel). 
c. Local Teams. A local Inquiry Team may consist of staff of 
that institution at the Associate Warden and/or department head 
levels. The institution will bear any expenses incurred. 
d. ()IA Assistance. When requested by a Regional Director, 
Warden, or Inquiry Team Chair, the OIA will provide consultation 
and other assistance to Boards and Teams as is necessary. 
8. INSTRUCTIONS FOR ALL BOARDS AND TEAMS 
a. Members must become familiar with Bureau directives 
applicable to the matter being reviewed. 
b. Members must review all written records, including 
investigative reports, medical records, or other records 
pertaining to the subject of the inquiry. 
EFTA00028726
--- PAGE 5 ---
PS 1210.21 
3/9/2000 
Page 5 
c. Members must visit the scene of an incident, reconstruct 
the chain of events, and record their observations by notes, 
photographs, audio or visual recordings, or other appropriate 
means. 
d. If, at any point during the inquiry, it becomes apparent 
that serious criminal or administrative misconduct is involved, 
OIA will be consulted to determine whether a referral to the 
Office of the Inspector General or Civil Rights Division is 
appropriate. If an OIA representative is not present, members 
will contact the Chief, OIA, for advice before proceeding 
further. 
e. Members must interview witnesses or other persons having 
knowledge of the incident, using the following procedures: 
(1) Advise any person being interviewed of the purpose of 
the interview, including the nature of the inquiry, and fully 
identify all members present. An individual's right to 
representation, if any, must be determined prior to the 
interview. For bargaining unit members, union representational 
rights will apply (see Employee Rights Article of Master 
Agreement). 
During the inquiry, witnesses or other persons having 
knowledge of the incident must be instructed to keep all 
information strictly confidential and instructed not to disclose 
any information concerning the nature of the inquiry or the 
information he or she has provided to anyone other than the Board 
or Team, or to an appropriate union representative. 
(2) If the inquiry develops information which focuses on 
the person being questioned, or about to be questioned, as a 
suspect in possible criminal misconduct, questioning of that 
person may not proceed until the local U.S. Attorney: 
# declines prosecution, 
# grants use immunity, or 
# recommends the interviewee be advised of his or her 
Miranda Rights. 
One of these conditions must be satisfied before questioning 
a person suspected of possible criminal misconduct. These 
contacts with the local U.S. Attorney will be coordinated through 
OIA. 
EFTA00028727
--- PAGE 6 ---
PS 1210.21 
3/9/2000 
Page 6 
c. Members must visit the scene of an incident, reconstruct 
statement. The witness will be permitted a reasonable 
opportunity to prepare and review the statement before swearing 
or affirming the truth of the statement. The Chair and members 
will have authority to administer oaths or affirmations to 
witnesses in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 303. 
# For a written statement. 
"I hereby declare (or certify, verify, or state) under 
penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and 
correct." 
# For an oral statement: 
"I swear (or affirm) under penalty of perjury that the 
statement I am about to make is true and correct." 
(4) All employees may be required by Boards of Inquiry, 
Regional Inquiry Teams, and local Inquiry Teams to answer 
questions regarding their employment, even though their answers 
may lead to disciplinary action up to and including removal; 
however, in criminal cases, employees retain their constitutional 
rights regarding avoidance of self-incrimination and may not be 
disciplined for properly exercising these rights. 
(5) Any visual or oral recordings made of interviews and 
other proceedings will be preserved to allow a reasonable 
opportunity for the resolution of any administrative review or 
appeal related to the inquiry. 
9. REPORTS 
a. General. The Board or Team will prepare a detailed report 
of its findings, including, if appropriate, recommendations. The 
report must include all documents or records (or copies of them) 
pertinent to the findings and recommendations. Any member of a 
Board or Team may submit a separate or dissenting report. 
b. Submission. The completed report, along with all working 
notes and other personal records created by members as a result 
of the inquiry, will be submitted to the official who appointed 
the Board or Team, unless the appointing official had done so at 
the request of the General Counsel or Regional Counsel. If the 
Board or Team was appointed at the request of the General Counsel 
or Regional Counsel, the completed report will be submitted 
directly to the requesting Counsel. 
EFTA00028728
--- PAGE 7 ---
PS 1210.21 
3/9/2000 
Page 7 
If a report is submitted to an appointing official (rather than 
to a requesting Counsel), three copies of the report will be 
submitted through OIA for filing in the Director's Office, in the 
Office of General Counsel, and in OIA. 
c. Release of Findings or Reports. Findings or reports of all 
Boards of Inquiry or Inquiry Teams will be released only upon the 
Director's authorization in consultation with the General 
Counsel. A Board of Inquiry report may be required to be 
produced in connection with civil or criminal proceedings or a 
FOIA request. A Board of Inquiry report may also be released in 
connection with a Congressional inquiry. 
If a subpoena or request for discovery is received in 
connection with any civil or criminal proceeding that demands, or 
reasonably could be construed as to demand, the production of a 
Board of Inquiry report, and/or any working notes or personal 
records created by members as a result of an inquiry, the 
subpoena should be forwarded to the Regional Counsel who, after 
consultation with the General Counsel and the Director, as 
necessary, will coordinate the production of the documents or 
assertion of any evidentiary privilege as appropriate with the 
local U.S. Attorney's Office. 
Findings or reports from Boards of Inquiry or Inquiry Teams 
appointed at the request of the General Counsel or a Regional 
Counsel prepared in anticipation of litigation or trial are to be 
reviewed by the General Counsel before any release, since these 
documents may be privileged documents protected from disclosure 
by the attorney work-product privilege. The General Counsel will 
make the determination of whether to assert this privilege. 
/s/

SEXUALLY ABUSE MINORS 
UNITED STATES ATTORNEY'S OFFICE 
Southern District of New York 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL CHARGED IN MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURT FOR 
CONSPIRING WITH JEFFREY EPSTEIN TO SEXUALLY ABUSE MINORS 
Maxwell is Alleged to Have Facilita- ted, Participated in Acts of Abuse 
Additionally Charged With Perjury in Connection With 2016 Depositions 
Audrey Strauss, the Acting United States Attorney- for the Southern District of New York, William F. 
Sweeney Jr., the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation ("FBI"), and Dermot Shea, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department ("NYPD"), 
announced that GHISLANE MAXWELL was arrested this morning and charged with enticing a minor to travel 
to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, 
conspiracy to commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. The Indictment 
unsealed today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 through 1997, MAXWELL and co-conspirator 
Jeffrey Epstein exploited girls as young as 14, including by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the 
EFTA00028737
--- PAGE 2 ---
purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference for young girls, 
MAXWELL played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations 
including New York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, MAXWELL made several false 
statements in sworn depositions in 2016. MAXWELL is expected to be presented this afternoon in the in federal 
court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan. 
Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated, aided, and 
participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then 
delivered them into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust. 
All the while, she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself. 
Today, after many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the 
most important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the 
law and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth into 
behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the quest for 
justice has been met with great disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. The 
example set by the women involved has been a powerful one. They persevered against the rich and connected, 
and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a subpoena - and they stood together. I have no doubt the bravery 
exhibited by the women involved here has empowered others to speak up about the crimes of which they've been 
subjected." 
NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said: "The heinous crimes these charges allege are, and always will 
be abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement 
partners, for their continuing commitment to bringing justice to the survivors of sexual assault, everywhere." 
If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, please contact 
the FBI at 1-800-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
According to the Indictment[ 11 unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated 
in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, 
which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies or 
taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at 
ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. 
Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to accept offers of 
financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. MAXWELL also 
normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, encouraging them to massage 
Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and 
susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between 
minor victims and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL 
was present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages 
EFTA00028738
--- PAGE 3 ---
during which a minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein 
involving a minor victim where MAXWELL was present. 
As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching 
of a victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to 
touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and 
Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as 
well as MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal 
sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to 
travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of 
transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, which carries a maximum sentence of 
years in prison, one count of conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual 
activity, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and two counts of perjury, each of which 
carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
The statutory maximum penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational 
purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be determined by the judge. 
Ms. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and the NYPD. 
This case is being handled by the Office's Public Corruption Unit. Assistant U.S. Attorneys 
and 
are in charge of the prosecution. 
The charges contained in the Indictment are merely accusations. The defendant is presumed innocent 
unless and until proven guilty.

As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching 
of a victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to 
touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and 
Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as 
well as MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal 
sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to

years in prison, one count of conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual 
activity, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and two counts of perjury, each of which 
carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
The statutory maximum penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational 
purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be determined by the judge. 
Ms. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and the NYPD.

PCU — Please join me in congratulating 
on the arrest this morning of Ghislaine Maxwell. 
spoke a bit about the case on our call on Tuesday and the truly remarkable job the team has done in bringing it. I won't 
repeat all of that, buy you should know, as you read press coverage today that already is making it seem like these charges 
were inevitable, that they were anything but, and that they are instead the result of an extraordinary amount of work and 
perseverance and creativity by 
in building a case based on conduct that I'm pretty sure is older 
than all of our paralegals. 
will be holding a press conference at 12, and while it is sadly not possible for all of us to be there to join her given 
current conditions, I hope we can all take a moment to remotely congratulate the team on a terrific accomplishment in 
bringing an extremely important case against a woman very worthy of criminal prosecution.

GHISLAINE MAXWELL CHARGED IN MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURT FOR 
CONSPIRING WITH JEFFREY EPSTEIN TO SEXUALLY ABUSE MINORS 
Maxwell is Alleged to Have Facilita- ted, Participated in Acts of Abuse 
Additionally Charged With Perjury in Connection With 2016 Depositions 
Audrey Strauss, the Acting United States Attorney- for the Southern District of New York, William F. 
Sweeney Jr., the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation ("FBI"), and Dermot Shea, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department ("NYPD"), 
announced that GHISLANE MAXWELL was arrested this morning and charged with enticing a minor to travel 
to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, 
conspiracy to commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. The Indictment 
unsealed today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 through 1997, MAXWELL and co-conspirator 
Jeffrey Epstein exploited girls as young as 14, including by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the 
EFTA00028749
--- PAGE 2 ---
purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference for young girls, 
MAXWELL played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations 
including New York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, MAXWELL made several false 
statements in sworn depositions in 2016. MAXWELL is expected to be presented this afternoon in the in federal 
court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan. 
Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated, aided, and 
participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then 
delivered them into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust. 
All the while, she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself. 
Today, after many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the 
most important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the 
law and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth into 
behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the quest for 
justice has been met with great disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. The 
example set by the women involved has been a powerful one. They persevered against the rich and connected, 
and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a subpoena - and they stood together. I have no doubt the bravery 
exhibited by the women involved here has empowered others to speak up about the crimes of which they've been 
subjected." 
NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said: "The heinous crimes these charges allege are, and always will 
be abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement 
partners, for their continuing commitment to bringing justice to the survivors of sexual assault, everywhere." 
If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, please contact 
the FBI at 1-800-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
According to the Indictment[ 11 unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated 
in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, 
which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies or 
taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at 
ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. 
Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to accept offers of 
financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. MAXWELL also 
normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, encouraging them to massage 
Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and 
susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between 
minor victims and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL 
was present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages 
EFTA00028750
--- PAGE 3 ---
during which a minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein 
involving a minor victim where MAXWELL was present. 
As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching 
of a victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to 
touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and 
Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as 
well as MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal 
sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to 
travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of

Hello, 
I'm concerned that Ghislaine Maxwell will suffer the same fate as Jeffrey Epstein if kept in jail without 24 hour 
supervision. There are many intelligence agencies and powerful individuals that don't want her to talk. Who 
knows, maybe even prison guards or inmates are being offered money to take her out. 
Please don't let Maxwell end up "killing herself'

Just to clarify, would it be possible for you to provide us even a very general or high-level summary of what she has told 
you? We ordinarily don't go into interviews completely blind when witnesses have counsel — and the Weinstein 
investigation had a great number of problems that we have been able to avoid. And separately, we'll of course keep you 
updated on our approval process as well. 
thanks again,

Thanks 
I am afraid that an attorney proffer will not be possible. I have been working with the DA in New York on the Weinstein 
case and have simply offered up my clients to questions which has worked well. 
I am of course happy to speak over the phone but it seems to me that you are better off getting the information first hand. If 
you wish it may be sensible for you to initially have a call with my client? 
My client has made a complaint to the Met police regarding a sexual assault by Jeffrey Epstein whilst in London and in the 
employment of G Maxwell. Apart from the complaint itself, no further information has been provided to the police. 
I appreciate the issue re coronavirus of course. 
Kind regards, 
Jill

That's great, thank you for letting us know, and we'll check on that right away and get back to you as soon as possible. 
The only wrinkle, which unfortunately is completely beyond our control, is that there is now some talk of government 
international travel being prevented due to the coronavirus situation, but we'll talk to the relevant people here 
immediately. 
One thing that would be extremely helpful for us in the near-term, including in terms of getting approvals here — and we 
talked about this on the phone as well — would be to get an attorney proffer about your understanding of generally what 
information you expect your client will convey on the subjects we've spoken about? We completely understand that it's 
best to have her tell her story directly to us, but in terms of our preparation it's often very useful for both us and the 
EFTA00028763

witness for us to have had a conversation with counsel in the first instance. Would it be possible to set up a call to have 
that discussion? We could do as soon as tomorrow or Friday, or also next week.

No problem at all, we understand this takes time, and we appreciate you getting back to us, and we're very grateful that 
your client is open to speaking with us. 
On your questions, we are certainly fine with the first two questions / requests — we're happy to meet with you and your 
client in an initial conversation, during which we can do the kind of introductions and explanations we've done with you 
(and that we do with all victim witnesses we meet), including answering any questions to the best of our ability, and 
then to take a break and have a more substantive discussion later on. 
Regarding the friend, does that individual also represent her as counsel? We aren't normally able to include individuals 
in addition to the witness and counsel in an interview—what does sometimes work is for someone who is providing 
support (a parent, friend, etc.) to be close by for any discussions, assistance, etc. anytime that a witness wants to speak 
with that person, which would of course be totally fine in this instance. Or if he represents her in his capacity as an 
attorney then he of course could be in the interview in that role (with the only caveat that we would just want to 
confirm that he himself is not separately a witness of some sort in the case). We unfortunately are not able to pay for 
third parties (including counsel) to travel in connection with witness interviews, though — if it's preferable, we certainly 
could pay for your client's travel to the U.S. for the interview, including airfare and lodging, if that makes it easier for the 
friend to be present? And we're happy to discuss any of this further by email or phone if that's useful — I'll be at my 
desk for the next several hours and most of tomorrow, at 
or we could also set a time to chat, whatever 
would be helpful.

Hello 
I
.
Apologies for the slight delay. My client is willing to help but asks the following: 
• 
That there be a morning meeting at which introductions with a discussion as to the investigation and my clients 
involvement. I appreciate that you have explained this to me but I think further verbal clarification would assist. 
• 
In the afternoon and after a break, my client would be willing to answer questions, in so far as she can. 
• 
That a friend of hers be allowed to be present as well. However that friend is based in the US and would need to 
be flown over to London. He is a US lawyer. 
Perhaps you could let me know if this is possible? 
Kind regards,

Following up on our phone call, thank you for talking with us again, and we wanted to get back to you regarding some 
of the additional follow-up questions you asked, and to describe in more detail for your client how we would expect to 
approach any discussion with your client if she were comfortable meeting with us. 
The absolute most important thing is that any discussion would be entirely voluntary, and by that we mean the 
decision to meet with us but also as to any topic or question—your client would be absolutely free to determine what 
topics she felt comfortable discussing. There is absolutely no pressure on victim witnesses to address anything that 
would make them uncomfortable at any time, and even if your client was willing to meet with us, we would tell her, as 
we do for any witness, that if any topic comes up that she wants to skip, or discuss with you privately, that is no 
problem at all. 
In fact, if you and she would prefer, we would be happy to have a meeting where we simply introduced ourselves, 
explained the status of our investigation, talked about how a discussion would proceed if your client ended up being 
comfortable with that, and answered in person any questions she. We have done that previously, where we do the 
talking rather than asking questions in an initial meeting, and that would of course be without any requirement for 
anything additional if she preferred not to. As I mentioned on the phone, we have consistently found that we are able 
to reassure individuals when we have the opportunity to meet in person so they can see directly our interest in 
approaching these discussions with great sensitivity and care. As I also mentioned on the phone, even if your client 
were willing to speak with us, there would be absolutely no need or requirement for her to talk about any assault or 
victimization she experienced. We wrote in our first email that we would primarily be interested in talking about 
topics such as the general scope of her employment, directions she received from Epstein or Maxwell, etc., and as 
always we would be guided by her comfort level. 
In terms of who would attend a meeting, we almost always work in pairs, so two prosecutors and two officers, and 
that's not to have extra people, but rather because it helps us to be as efficient as we can, and so witnesses can meet 
the people on the team. Our team is also majority female, and we always tell witnesses that if topics come up in a 
discussion that they would prefer to speak about just with women, that's fine and we can be flexible in the moment 
and are always guided by the comfort level of the victim. But I also want to stress that in terms of your client in 
particular, we don't expect to initially address issues of a very personal or sexual nature, and we certainly would tell 
you in advance if there came a time when we thought that might be important to address, and how we could facilitate 
that. Who exactly from our team would be at any meeting would depend on schedules, but we can assure you that 
every one of us has now spoken with dozens of victims in this case, and every one of us has extensive experience more 
generally working with victims and working on cases involving sex offenses. We are proud of how we have been able 
to work with victims in this case especially, given all of the circumstances, and we absolutely would take the same 
sensitive approach with your client as we have with the many other victims in this case who have spoken with us. 
EFTA00028767
--- PAGE 7 ---
Again, if it would be helpful even for us to just come to the U.K. and introduce ourselves and explain in person how our 
process works, and answer any questions your client has in person, we would absolutely be happy to do that with no 
obligation at all from her. We also could do that with the possibility that if she felt comfortable, we could just address 
the general subject of her employment, for example. But no obligation and no pressure. We continue to appreciate 
your and her willingness to even broach the possibility of a discussion, and we hope this is helpful.

Subject: RE: Epstein investigation 
Thanks for circling back, and we'll do our best to answer these questions. In terms of who would be in the room, the 
most likely answer is that it would be two of the prosecutors and the two law enforcement officers on the case. The 
only reason I saw "most likely" rather than having a definitive answer is that when we're interviewing in a foreign 
country, it sometimes is the case the local law enforcement also insists on having representatives present. I don't 
believe that's required in the U.K., but we can check on it and give you a definitive answer in the coming days if that's 
useful. (Also, if she preferred to be interviewed in the U.S., we certainly could guarantee that the room would be just 
the case team, and we could arrange for travel and lodging for her. Let us know if that's the case, but otherwise we're 
of course happy to travel to her.) 
Regarding access to notes, it would principally be the investigative team—so again, the prosecutors and the FBI team 
working on the case. Our respective supervisors also theoretically have access to our files, but the reports are not 
generally widely disseminated. The basic logistics are that an agent takes notes during an interview, and then types up 
those notes into a formal report (called an FBI Form 302). We don't ordinarily share notes with other entities, but I 
can also check on that to see if I can make a more specific representation with respect to your client. 
With respect to anonymity, I confess that I'm not familiar with the distinction you're referring to. In terms of our 
investigation, we don't publicly disclose the names of individuals we meet with, and we don't disclose to any other 
witnesses, for example, the identities of victims or witnesses we are meeting with. (And our policies on that don't 
change even for individuals who are in the position of your client, who have been widely publicly reported to have 
been connected to Epstein and/or his employees or associates). But if that doesn't answer your question, we're of 
course happy to discuss further. Let me know if it might be useful to have a call? Or if not, also happy to address any 
follow-up via email. 
thanks,

Hi 
Thanks for this. I've been asked who would be in the room and thereafter who would have access to any 
notes made. Would her permission be sought before disclosing to any other parties or officials? 
As you know there is a real difficulty in relation to her anonymity in the US versus the UK. Are you able to 
provide any comfort on this? 
Many thanks

Thank you again for speaking with us earlier today regarding our interest in talking with your client in connection 
with our investigation into the conduct of Jeffrey Epstein. 
As requested, we wanted to briefly memorialize our current views and understandings of your client, and also to 
reiterate our interest in approaching any discussion with great care and sensitivity, particularly to avoid adding to her 
trauma or causing re-victimization. 
As we mentioned on the phone, your client is not a target of our investigation—it sounds like the analogue in the 
U.K. may be the "suspect" category—and we currently do not have reason to believe that she has committed any 
U.S. federal crime. As we discussed, our knowledge of your client specifically is somewhat limited, having never 
spoken to her—and therefore knowing about her only through other witnesses and records—but it certainly has 
been our experience that the overwhelming majority of young women and girls who were in the orbit of Jeffrey 
Epstein during the relevant periods were subject to his abuse. It does not surprise us, nor do we have any trouble 
believing, that your client was similarly a victim. I hope that is helpful in understanding the capacity in which we 
hope to speak with her. 
Separately, and as we also discussed, any discussion with our team would be entirely voluntary—and that extends 
not just to whether she would be willing to meet with us at all, but also including her ability to decline to discuss 
particular topics or even particular questions, and to talk with her counsel at any time, to take any breaks that would 
be beneficial while we're meeting, etc. 
In terms of topic areas, we would be hoping to learn about the general narrative of her interactions with Epstein and 
his other associates and employees, including Ghislaine Maxwell, whom we understand she may have worked 
EFTA00028769
--- PAGE 9 ---
directly for. That would broadly include how she came to be in contact with them, the nature and scope of her 
employment, any instructions she was given relating to other women or girls, and just generally her experiences and 
observations in interacting with them. We ordinarily would also be interested in understanding the general nature of 
the abuse she was subjected to, but I want to emphasize that we would not need to discuss with her the specifics if 
she weren't comfortable with that, and in particular we often don't even broach that subject in a first meeting. 
Please let us know if you have any additional questions, and in particular whether any other information from us 
would be useful, and we look forward to speaking with you again soon.

Good morning, 
The above-captioned case was wheeled out to Judge Nathan this morning. Attached please find the indictment. 
The defendant was arrested at approximately 8:30am in New Hampshire, and the Government expects that she will be 
presented before a Untied States Magistrate Judge in the District of New Hampshire this afternoon. The Government 
intends to seek the defendant's detention, and if that application is denied in New Hampshire, the Government expects to 
seek an appeal of that determination before Judge Nathan. 
The AUSAs on this case are cc'd on this email, and I have listed our respective phone numbers below: 
We would be very grateful if the Court would be able to set an initial conference date that the Government can convey at

I am a reporter at The Sun and I recently did an interview with a source who has a lot of information about

now wants to cooperate with authorities on the Maxwell case. I believe he is credible. 
He named many names to me which we didn't publish but he is happy to share with investigators.

Re: 
United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 (RMB) 
Dear Judge Berman: 
The Government respectfully submits this letter in response to the defendant's Motion for 
Pretrial Release (the "Release Motion"), dated July 11, 2019 (Dkt. 6), and in further support of its 
Memorandum in Support of Detention (the "Detention Memo"), submitted to Magistrate Judge 
Pitman on July 8, 2019, which is attached hereto and incorporated herein (Ex. A). 
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 
The defendant is a serial sexual predator who is charged with abusing underage girls for 
years. A grand jury has returned an indictment alleging that he sexually exploited dozens of 
minors, including girls as young as 14 years old, in New York and Florida. To this day, he is a 
registered sex offender designated by New York State in the highest category of risk to reoffend, 
despite unsuccessfully attempting to have that classification lowered. And any doubt that the 
defendant is unrepentant and unreformed was eliminated when law enforcement agents discovered 
hundreds or thousands of nude and seminude photographs of young females in his Manhattan 
mansion on the night of his arrest, more than a decade after he was first convicted of a sex crime 
involving a juvenile. 
The defendant also faces substantial evidence of his guilt, founded on the corroborated 
testimony of numerous victims, and this case presents the very real possibility that he will go to 
prison for the rest of his life. The defendant has at his disposal a vast fortune, the details of which 
remain largely concealed from the Court. He also has a history of obstruction and manipulation 
of witnesses, including, as detailed herein, as recently as within the past year, when media reports 
about his conduct reemerged. And he continues to show a shocking lack of understanding of the 
gravity of the harm he has perpetrated, including through the minimization of his conduct and 
casual disparagement of victims in his arguments. 
Against this backdrop of significant—and rapidly-expanding—evidence, serious charges, 
and the prospect of a lengthy prison sentence, the defendant proposes to be released on conditions 
that are woefully inadequate. The Release Motion misconstrues and misunderstands the relevant

law, seeks to diminish and demean the harm caused to the many victims of the defendant's 
appalling sexual abuse, and utterly fails to meet its burden of rebutting the presumption that no 
condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as 
required and the safety of the community. Rather than even attempting to address the grave risks 
of releasing a defendant with extraordinary financial resources and a history of abusing minors, 
the defendant instead proposes a bail package that amounts to little more than a barely-secured 
bond masquerading as a 14-point plan. The Court should reject the defendant's application and 
order him detained pending trial. 
Among other things, the proposed bail package contemplates the defendant pledging as the 
principal security a property that has already been identified by the Government as subject to 
forfeiture upon the defendant's conviction, and which therefore is of no value as collateral. His 
proposed global waiver of extradition is unenforceable, and even if enforceable would be little 
comfort to victims forced to wait additional years while the defendant is located and returned to 
this country. The promise to "deregister or otherwise ground" his private jet is meaningless given 
his wealth and ability to easily secure other means of travel. The two co-signers he proposes only 
further highlight his minimal community ties, including his lack of any family in or near the 
District. Electronic monitoring would merely give the defendant less of a head start in fleeing—
and does not guard against the risk of him endangering victims in the very home where he has 
continued to hoard nude images of young women and girls. And the private security force he 
proposes to guard his gilded cage, a proposal already rejected by this Court in similar 
circumstances, simply reinforces the obvious fact that the defendant should be housed where he 
can be secured at all times: a federal correctional center. 
The defendant faces a presumption of detention, Pretrial Services has recommended 
detention, and victims of the defendant seek his detention. Because there are no set of conditions 
short of incarceration that can reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant or reasonably 
protect the community from the dangers he poses if released, the Court should order him detained. 
BACKGROUND 
As previously set forth, a federal grand jury in this District returned an indictment (the 
"Indictment") charging the defendant with violating Title 18, United States Code Section 1519, 
and conspiracy to commit the same. 
As charged by the grand jury, the facts giving rise to those counts involve a years-long 
scheme to sexually abuse underage girls. Specifically, the defendant enticed and recruited dozens 
of minor girls to engage in sex acts with him, for which he paid the victims hundreds of dollars in 
cash, in at least two different states. Victims were initially recruited to provide "massages" to the 
defendant, which would be performed nude or partially nude, would become increasingly sexual 
in nature, and would typically include one or more sex acts, including groping and direct or indirect 
contact with victims' genitals. To perpetuate this exploitation of underage girls, the defendant 
actively encouraged certain victims to recruit additional girls to be similarly sexually abused. He 
paid these victim-recruiters hundreds of dollars for each additional girl they brought to him, 
creating a network of underage victims for him to exploit in New York and Palm Beach.

Page 3 
The defendant, through counsel, continues to evidence a complete lack of appreciation for 
the gravity of the offenses with which he is charged.' As an initial matter, there can be no plausible 
suggestion that the allegations against the defendant involve isolated or aberrational conduct; they 
involve repeated, regular acts of sexual abuse committed over a period of many years. And 
following the defendant's prior conviction, as described previously by the Government, the 
defendant continued to maintain at least hundreds and possibly thousands of nude photos of young 
subjects. The defendant's victims in this case, often particularly vulnerable girls, were as young 
as 14 years old when he abused them. The defendant knew he was abusing minors, including 
because victims told him directly they were underage. And he preyed on his victims habitually 
and repeatedly—day after day, month after month, year after year. 
The defense calls these disturbing alleged acts "simple prostitution!' Mag. Tr. 12:12; see 
also D. Tr. at 6:15-19 ("This is basically the Feds today . . . redoing the same conduct that was 
investigated 10 years ago and calling it, instead of prostitution, calling it sex trafficking"). That 
characterization is not only offensive but also utterly irrelevant given that federal law does not 
recognize the concept of a child prostitute—there are only trafficking victims—because a child 
cannot legally consent to being exploited. 
Defense counsel's repeated assertion that the 
Government's case is infirm because no threats or coercion are alleged—e.g., Mag. Tr. at 12 
("There was no coercion. There were no threats. There was no violence."), 17 ("there was no 
coercion. There was no intimidation. There is no deception."); Release Motion at 2 ("There are 
no allegations . . . that he forced, coerced, defrauded, or enslaved anybody . . . .")—is equally 
irrelevant because the offense with which the defendant has been charged requires no such proof. 
See, e.g., United States v. Afrare, 632 F. App'x 272, 278 (6th Cir. 2016) ("We hold that § 1591(a) 
criminalizes the sex trafficking of children (less than 18 years old) with or without any force, fraud, 
or coercion, and it also criminalizes the sex trafficking of adults (18 or older), but only if done by 
force, fraud, or coercion."). 
Far more important, the defense has already effectively conceded that the Government will 
be able to present evidence of the actual primary elements of the charged offense—i.e., that the 
defendant engaged in sex acts for money with girls he knew were underage. See Release Motion 
at 2. On this record, the Government agrees with Pretrial Services that the defendant should be 
detained pending trial. He poses a tremendous risk of flight and a danger to the community, and 
he cannot overcome the statutory presumption in favor of detention in this case. 
' Such arguments are unsurprising from a defendant who previously compared himself to a "person 
who steals a bagel" or a tragic mythical figure. See, e.g., Amber Southerland, Billionaire Jeffrey 
Epstein: I'm a sex offender, not a predator, N.Y. Post (2011) ("I'm not a sexual predator, I'm an 
"offender," the financier told The Post yesterday. `It's the difference between a murderer and a 
person who steals a bagel.'"); Philip Weiss, The Fantasist, NY Magazine (2007) ("`It's the Icarus 
story, someone who flies too close to the sun,' I said. 'Did Icarus like massages?' Epstein asked."). 
"Mag. Tr." refers to the transcript of the hearing before Magistrate Judge Pitman on July 8, 2019; 
"D. Tr." refers to the transcript of the hearing before this Court on July 8, 2019.

United States District Judge

ARGUMENT 
The Government respectfully submits that the defendant cannot overcome the statutory 
presumption in favor of detention in this case for the following reasons, among others: 
I. 
Victims Seek Detention 
Pursuant to the Crime Victims' Rights Act ("CVRA"), a crime victim has the right to be 
reasonably heard at certain public proceedings in the district court, including proceedings 
involving release. 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(4). Consistent with that requirement, the Government has 
been in contact with victims and counsel identified through this investigation in connection with 
the argument regarding bail. 
Multiple victims and/or their counsel have asked the Government to seek detention (and to 
inform the Court of their views in that respect) for multiple reasons. First, they believe that the 
defendant's continued detention is necessary under the CVRA's right to be reasonably protected 
from the accused. 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(1). They have specifically conveyed to the Government 
that they would be fearful for their safety if the defendant were released. For the reasons articulated 
herein, the Government believes those concerns to be well-founded. 
Additionally, certain victims have asked the Government to advise the Court that they are 
specifically concerned about the defendant's proposal to be released even if under conditions that 
included home detention and full-time private guards. They believe it would be unfair to victims 
of a wealthy defendant, like Epstein, if he were to be given greater freedoms than others would be 
in similar circumstances, and that such an arrangement would be inconsistent with their rights. 
They specifically asked the Government to advise the Court that they believed such an arrangement 
could result in harassment and abuse by the defendant. 3
II. 
The Defendant's Proposal Does Nothing to Mitigate His Flight Risk 
Each of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk—the nature and circumstances 
of the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant—
counsel strongly in favor of detention, and the defendant's proposed package would do nothing 
whatsoever to mitigate those risks. 
A. Defendant Proposes No Infringement Upon His Ability to Use his Vast Wealth to Flee 
It might not be immediately apparent to a reader of the Release Motion that the defendant 
is extravagantly wealthy and worth, according to records relating to the defendant recently 
obtained by the Government from a financial institution ("Institution-1"), more than $500 million. 
The Government is aware of at least one additional attorney for a victim who has publicly stated 
that her client supports the pretrial detention of the defendant. The Government is unaware of any 
victim who has expressed support for the defendant being granted pretrial release on bail.

United States District Judge 
July 12, 2019 
Page 5 
Indeed, while the defendant has still not filled out a financial affidavit, under penalty of 
perjury, in connection with his application for bail, his token effort to account for his finances 
makes painfully clear the need for detention. The defendant reports having an extraordinary 
amount of money in both total assets and cash or cash-equivalent holdings. And while the 
defendant repeatedly represents in his Release Motion that his assets are "in the United States," 
there is absolutely nothing in the defendant's minimal financial submission to verify that. 
Indeed, and as discussed further below, even assuming the defendant's assets are presently 
in the United States, nothing in the proposed package would prevent the defendant from 
transferring liquid assets out of the country quickly and in anticipation of flight or relocation. The 
defendant is an incredibly sophisticated financial actor with decades of experience in the industry 
and significant ties to financial institutions and actors around the world. He could easily transfer 
funds and holdings on a moment's to places where the Government would never find them so as 
to ensure he could live comfortably while a fugitive. 
But perhaps most important, even were the defendant to sacrifice literally all of his current 
assets, there is every indication that he would immediately be able to resume making millions or 
tens of millions of dollars per year outside of the United States. He already earns at least 
_ 
$10,000,000 per year, according to records from Institution-1, while living in the U.S. Virgin 
Islands, traveling extensively abroad, and residing in part in Paris, France; there would be little to 
stop the defendant from fleeing, transferring his unknown assets abroad, and then continuing to do 
whatever it is he does to earn his vast wealth from a computer terminal beyond the reach of 
extradition.' 
That the defendant faces up to 45 years of incarceration on the current counts with which 
he is charged provides the motive for him do so and is another significant factor in assessing the 
risk of flight. See United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 7 (2d Cir. 1987). So too is the strength of 
the evidence, detailed above and in the Government's Detention Memo. Indeed, that evidence, 
already robust less than a week ago when the Indictment was unsealed, is growing stronger by the 
day. Just since the Indictment was unsealed, several additional women, in multiple jurisdictions, 
have identified themselves to the Government as having been victimized by the defendant when 
they were minors. Moreover, pursuant to judicially-authorized search warrants, the Government 
has discovered and seized a significant volume of photographs of nude and seminude young 
women and girls in the defendant's Manhattan residence, and is in the process of reviewing dozens 
of electronic discs that contain still more such photos? And dozens of individuals have called the 
Government in recent days to convey information regarding the defendant and the allegations 
As noted in the Government's Detention Memo, the defendant is a frequent traveler and regularly 
travels to and from the United States, including approximately more than 20 flights in which he 
traveled to or from a foreign country since 2018 alone. Extensive international travel of this nature 
further demonstrates a significant risk of flight. See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp. 
2d 32, 36 (D.D.C. 2005). 
The Government's review of these materials, seized earlier this week, remains ongoing.

contained in the Indictment. All this in less than a week, and all in addition to an Indictment that 
already alleges the existence of dozens of victims in New York and dozens of victims in Florida. 
B. The Proposed Bond is Inadequate to Overcome the Presumption of Detention 
The defendant's "slate of highly restrictive" measures which purportedly "amply suffice to 
secure his release" are neither highly restrictive nor amply sufficient. Rather, they are effectively 
standard conditions of home confinement, monitoring, and bond unsecured by the defendant's 
assets—broken out into 14 pieces. The Government will address the most concerning and salient 
elements of the defendant's proposal below. 
I. Lack of Meaningful Bond Security 
The defendant proposes that the Court accept his Manhattan mansion as the primary 
security for a personal recognizance bond of an indeterminate amount, to be co-signed by the 
defendant's brother and a friend. Release Motion at 4. This is plainly insufficient. 
As an initial matter, and as noted above, the defendant's Manhattan mansion has been 
identified in the Indictment as subject to forfeiture because it is alleged to have been used to 
commit or facilitate the commission of the sex trafficking offenses charged there. See 18 U.S.C. 
§ 1594(c)(1). 
Because the defendant would thus be likely to lose that property following a 
conviction, it provides no value whatsoever as collateral. See 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g)(4) ("In 
considering the conditions of release described . . . the judicial officer . . . shall decline to accept 
the designation, or the use as collateral, of property that, because of its source, will not reasonably 
assure the appearance of the person as required."). And while the defendant offers to also pledge 
his private jet as additional collateral, there is absolutely no reason to assume that the defendant 
would not readily trade his private plane for his freedom. Indeed, the defendant, who has a net 
worth of more than $500 million, by his own admission recently sold a second plane and thus 
presumably has cash on hand to replace the posted aircraft without difficulty if need be. 
Nor does the proposed security of properties owned by two identified co-signers 
meaningfully change the calculus. As further described below, the defendant provides no 
information about the value or equity of the property of his brother, Mark (the "Palm Beach 
Property"), or the significance of that property in the context of his brother's own net worth!' 
Similarly, the defendant provides no details regarding the "investment interests" of his friend Mr. 
Mitchell, nor any reason to believe the loss of those "interests" would be meaningful to Mr. 
Mitchell, let alone the defendant. More generally, given the defendant's proffered net worth, the 
defendant could easily make his co-signers whole — and even reward them — were he to flee. 
The proposed security, in sum, should give the Court little comfort the defendant would 
appear in Court if released on bail. 
In fact, the defendant's own submission makes clear that the Palm Beach Property is not his 
brother's exclusive residence and that his brother lives elsewhere for half of the year.

Page 7 
2. Co-Signers, Moral Suasion, and Ties to the Community 
The dearth of detailed financial information about the defendant himself, much less his 
brother or friend, further shows the hollowness of the proposal. The Court cannot possibly 
evaluate whether there would be any incentive whatsoever for those the two proposed co-signers 
to exercise moral suasion over the defendant—or whether, as noted above, the defendant could 
easily compensate them, perhaps many times over, for any loss they incurred through the 
defendant's flight from justice. The defendant provides no information about his brother other 
than that he lives half the year in the home he purportedly would pledge, and even less information 
about Mr. Mitchell, other than that he is "Mr. Epstein's friend," his "close personal friend of 
decades," and his "close personal friend." Release Motion at 4, 9. Their willingness to "guarantee" 
his appearance, Release Motion at 9, is meaningless in the absence of such information. 
Moreover, the notion that any individual co-signer could meaningfully secure a bond for 
this defendant strains credulity. Given the defendant's wealth and his extraordinary risk of flight, 
any bond for this defendant would assuredly have to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars to 
even be claimed to be sufficient to guard against the risks posed by the defendant's release. The 
defendant offers no reason to believe any co-signers could meaningfully sign such a bond, much 
less these two particular individuals, which is yet another reason the proposed package is patently 
insufficient. 
3. The Defendant's "Consent" to Extradition is Unenforceable and Impractical 
The defendant's offer to sign a so-called "consent" to extradition provides no additional 
reassurance whatsoever. As an initial matter, the Government would need to find and re-arrest the 
defendant before such a waiver would even come into play. Moreover, even assuming the 
Government could locate and apprehend the defendant, numerous courts have recognized that such 
purported waivers are unenforceable and effectively meaningless because any defendant who signs 
such a purported waiver and then flees will assuredly contest the validity and/or voluntariness of 
the waiver, and will get to do so in the jurisdiction of his choosing (Le., the one to which he chose 
to flee). See, e.g., United States v. Morrison, No. 16-MR-118, 2016 WL 7421924, at *4 (W.D.N.Y. 
Dec. 23, 2016); United States v. Kazeem, No. 15 Cr. 172, 2015 WL 4645357, at *3 (D. Or. Aug. 
3, 2015); United States v. Young, Nos. 12 Cr. 502, 12 Cr. 645, 2013 WL 12131300, at *7 (D. Utah 
Aug. 27, 2013); United States v. Cohen, No. C 10-00547, 2010 WL 5387757, at *9 n.11 (N.D. 
Cal. Dec. 20, 2010); United States v. Bohn, 330 F. Supp. 2d 960, 961 (W.D. Tenn. 2004); United 
States v. Stroh, No. 396 Cr. 139, 2000 WL 1832956, at *5 (D. Conn. Nov. 3, 2000); United States 
v. Botero, 604 F. Supp. 1028, 1035 (S.D. Fla. 1985). . The Department of Justice's Office of 
International Affairs is unaware of any country anywhere in the world that would consider an 
anticipatory extradition waiver binding. And, of course, the defendant could choose to flee to a 
jurisdiction with which the United States does not have an extradition treaty. 
Beyond being impossible to guarantee, extradition is typically a lengthy, complicated and 
expensive process, and the possibility that it would be successful neither provides any real 
deterrent to the defendant's incentive to flee nor any measure of justice to the victims who would 
be required to wait years for his return.

4. Home Confinement and Electronic Monitoring Provide No Assurance 
The defendant's proposal of ankle-bracelet monitoring should be of no comfort to the 
Court. In particular, the defendant's endorsement of a GPS monitoring bracelet rather than a radio 
frequency bracelet is farcical because neither one is useful or effective after it has been removed. 
At best, home confinement and electronic monitoring would reduce his head start should he decide 
to cut the bracelet and flee. See United States v. Zarger, No. 00 Cr. 773, 2000 WL 1134364, at *1 
(E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2000) (rejecting defendant's application for bail in part because home detention 
with electronic monitoring "at best . . . limits a fleeing defendant's head start"); see also United 
States v. Casteneda, No. 18 Cr. 047, 2018 WL 888744, at *9 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 2018) (same); United 
States v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp.2d 32, 41 (D.D.C. 2005) (same); United States v. Benatar, No. 02 
Cr. 099, 2002 WL 31410262, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 10, 2002) (same). 
5. Private Security is Inadequate, Unfair, and Impractical Here 
The defendant also proposes the use of a private security force to march him to and from 
court under the threat of deadly force. This proposal should be rejected. 
At the outset, it is far from clear that private jail, which seeks to replicate the conditions of 
a government-run detention facility in the defendant's home, is a condition of "release" that 
implicates the Bail Reform Act. "[T]here is a debate within the judiciary over whether a defendant, 
if she is able to perfectly replicate a private jail in her own home at her own cost, has a right to do 
so under the Bail Reform Act and the United States Constitution." United States v. Valerio, 9 F. 
Supp. 3d 283, 292 (E.D.N.Y. 2014) (Bianco, J.) (collecting cases). The Second Circuit has never 
directly addressed this issue. See United States v. Sabhnani, 493 F.3d 63, 78 n.18 (2d Cir. 2007) 
("The government has not argued and, therefore, we have no occasion to consider whether it would 
be `contrary to the principles of detention and release on bail' to allow wealthy defendants 'to buy 
their way out by constructing a private jail." (citations omitted)). Indeed, a decision by this Court 
reasoned that "the very severe restrictions" in the private jail proposal presented to him did "not 
appear to contemplate 'release' so much as it describes a very expensive form of private jail or 
detention." United States v. Zarrab, 2016 WL 3681423, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. June 16, 2016). 
Courts have long been troubled by private jail proposals like the defendant's which, "at 
best 'elaborately replicate a detention facility without the confidence of security such a facility 
instills."' United States v. Orena, 986 F.2d 628, 632 (2d Cir. 1993) (quoting United States v. Gotti, 
776 F. Supp. 666, 672 (E.D.N.Y. 1991) (rejecting private jail proposal)); see also Valerio, 9 F. 
Supp. 3d at 295 ("The questions about the legal authorization for the private security firm to use 
force against defendant should he violate the terms of his release, and the questions over whether 
the guards can or should be armed, underscore the legal and practical uncertainties—indeed, the 
imperfections-of the private jail-like concept envisioned by defendant, as compared to the more 
secure option of an actual jail."). A private security firm simply cannot replicate the controlled 
environment of a federal correctional facility, in which, typically, all of the needs to the prisoner 
can be attended to without placing the prisoner in the community at large; the defendant's proposed 
private jail arrangement would have the effect of permanently placing him in just such a high-
flight-risk circumstance. The risk of a public escape attempt while in the community and involving

Page 9 
armed private guards attempting to stop the defendant, potentially by force—rather than the 
defendant being in the environment of a federal facility—also greatly magnifies the danger of the 
defendant's flight to the public. See United States v. Boustani, 356 F. Supp. 3d 246, 257 (E.D.N.Y. 
2019). "This is why, as the Government correctly notes, federal prisoners should be detained in 
facilities run by trained personnel from federal correctional facilities." Id. at 258 (citing Sablznani, 
493 F.3d at 74 n.13 ("To the extent [armed private guards] implies an expectation that deadly force 
may need to be used to assure defendant['s] presence at trial... [s]uch a conclusion would, in fact, 
demand a defendant's detention")). 
The Second Circuit has held it is not legal error "for a district court to decline to accept," 
as "a substitute for detention," a defendant hiring private security guards to monitor him. United 
States v. Bank, 369 Fed. App'x 152, 153-54 (2d Cir. 2010). In the same decision, the Second 
Circuit noted that it was "troubled" by the possibility of "allow[ing] wealthy defendants to buy 
their way out by constructing a private jail." (internal quotation marks omitted)). Id.; accord, e.g., 
United States v. Cilins, No. 13 Cr. 315 (WHP), 2013 WL 3802012, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. July 19, 2013) 
("it is contrary to underlying principles of detention and release on bail that individuals otherwise 
ineligible for release should be able to buy their way out by constructing a private jail, policed by 
security guards not trained or ultimately accountable to the Government, even if carefully 
selected' (quoting Borodin v. Ashcroft, 136 F. Supp. 2d 125, 134 (E.D.N.Y. 2001))); Valerio, 9 
F. Supp. 3d at 293-94 (E.D.N.Y. 2014) ("There is nothing in the Bail Reform Act that would 
suggest that a defendant (or even, hypothetically, a group of defendants with private funding) has 
a statutory right to replicate or construct a private jail in a home or some other location."). 
The defendant's payment of his guards also raises the conflict of interest inherent in having 
the defendant having extraordinary influence over a private security company tasked with guarding 
him, leaving the company's incentives entirely aligned with the defendant. See, e.g., Boustani, 
356 F. Supp. 3d at 257 (in finding that private armed guards would not reasonably assure the 
appearance of a defendant, noting a "clear conflict of interest—private prison guards paid by an 
inmate" and noting that in a recent S.D.N.Y. case involving private security guards the defendant 
"was outside of his apartment virtually all day, every weekday; was visited by a masseuse for a 
total of 160 hours in a 30-day period; and went on an unauthorized visit to a restaurant in 
Chinatown with his private guards in tow"); see also United States v. Tajideen, 17 Cr. 046, 2018 
WL 1342475, at *5-6 (D.D.C. Mar. 15, 2018) (finding Zarrab "particularly instructive" and further 
noting: "While the Court has no reason to believe that the individuals selected for the defendant's 
security detail would intentionally violate federal law and assist the defendant in fleeing the Court's 
jurisdiction, it nonetheless is mindful of the power of money and its potential to corrupt or 
undermine laudable objectives. And although these realities cannot control the Court's ruling, they 
also cannot be absolutely discounted or ignored."). 
Finally, in Zarrab this Court found that "the Defendant's privately funded armed guard 
proposal is unreasonable because it helps to foster inequity and unequal treatment in favor of a 
very small cohort of criminal defendants who are extremely wealthy, such as Mr. Zarrab." 2016 
WL 3681423, at *13; see also Boustani, 356 F. Supp. 3d at 258 ("although this Defendant has vast 
financial resources to construct his own `private prison,' the Court is not convinced 'disparate 
treatment based on wealth is permissible under the Bail Reform Act", (quoting United States v.

Bruno, 89 F. Supp. 3d 425, 432 (E.D.N.Y. 2015) ("Even if Defendant had the financial capacity 
to replicate a private jail within his own home, this Court is not convinced that such a set of 
conditions would be sufficiently effective in this case to protect the community from Defendant, 
or that such disparate treatment based on wealth is permissible under the Bail Act.")); Borodin, 
136 F. Supp. 2d at 134 (E.D.N.Y. 2001) (Nickerson, J.) ("It is contrary to underlying principles of 
detention and release on bail that individuals otherwise ineligible for release should be able to buy 
their way out by constructing a private jail, policed by security guards not trained or ultimately 
accountable to the government, even if carefully selected."). 
If the defendant's appearance can only be assured through use of round-the-clock guards, 
the defendant belongs in a federal detention center, not released under bail conditions that 
effectively create a private prison of one, using guards to be paid by the defendant himself. It is 
frankly outrageous for the defendant to suggest that preventing him from using his vast wealth to 
duplicate a private prison that cannot control, monitor, and contain him consistent with the 
requirements of the Bail Act would cause him to somehow "bear a special disadvantage." Release 
Motion at 12 n.9. Indeed: "What more compelling case for an order of detention is there than a 
case in which only an armed guard and the threat of deadly force is sufficient to assure the 
defendant's appearance?' Zarrab, 2016 WL 3681432, at *12 (quoting United States v. Valerio, 9 
F. Supp. 3d at 295). 
III. 
The Defendant Provides No Assurance He is Not a Danger to the Community and a 
Risk to Obstruct Justice 
A. Danger to the Community 
In the first instance, the defendant's argument that 14 years without a criminal conviction 
eliminates "any danger presumption" should be rejected. Were that the case—which is certainly 
is not—a lack of criminal record for any defendant would automatically rebut the presumption 
applicable to crimes such as sex trafficking. That is manifestly incorrect. See United States v. 
Antis, 607 F. App'x 95, 97 (2d Cir. 2015) (finding that a defendant's lack of criminal record was 
"not so compelling as to defeat the presumption or to manifest clear error in the district court's 
determination that no combination of release conditions . . . could reasonably assure against 
dangerousness and the risk of flight"). Moreover, here, the defendant not only has a criminal 
record, but has been convicted of a sex crime involving a minor. 
But the ongoing and forward-looking danger posed by the defendant is further 
demonstrated by the defendant's maintenance of a substantial collection of photographic trophies 
of his victims and other young females in his mansion, as discovered by the Government through 
its search warrants. As indicated in the Detention Memo, the many discs found in the defendant's 
residence included those with hand-written labels including the following: "Young [Name] + 
[Name]," "Misc nudes I," and "Girl pies nude." Not surprisingly, the Government has found that 
such discs contain photographs of sexually suggestive photographs of fully- or partially-nude 
females appearing to be underage.

Page 11 
B. Danger to Obstruct Justice 
The defendant has also already demonstrated a willingness to use intimidation and 
aggressive tactics in connection with a criminal investigation. Far from being "musty," Release 
Motion at 6 n.6, the defendant's past behavior in connection with being investigated for sexually 
abusing children is the best predictor of his likely incentives and activities in connection with being 
charged with sexually abusing children. For example, in the incident the defendant now claims 
was not attributable to or authorized by him, the contemporaneous police report indicates that 
pressure tactics were at the vet), least coordinated closely with individuals in the defendant's orbit. 
See Palm Beach Police Report (the "Police Report") (Ex. B). According to the Police Report, the 
parent of one of the defendant's victims was driven off the road by a private investigator. The 
Police Report provides further information regarding victim and witness threats and intimidation 
reported against an individual who was directly in contact with an assistant of the defendant, 
followed "immediately" by a call to that same individual from a phone number associated with the 
defendant's businesses and associates. 
Separately, and in addition, there are also extensive allegations of obstruction and 
tampering in connection with civil lawsuits brought against the defendant following his 2008 
conviction. See Doe v. United States, 08 Civ. 80736 (S.D. Fla.), Dkt. 291-15 at 21-23, 31. 
Moreover, police reports suggest that an associate of Epstein's was offering to buy victims' silence 
during the course of the prior investigation. Specifically, one victim reported that "she was 
personally contacted through a source that has maintained contact with Epstein," who "assured 
[the victim] that she would receive monetary compensation for her assistance in not cooperating 
with law enforcement." Indeed, the victim reported having been told: "Those who help him will 
be compensated and those who hurt him will be dealt with." See Palm Beach Police Report 
(Ex. C). 
And Epstein's efforts to influence witnesses continue to this day. As in the past, within 
recent months. he paid significant amounts of money to influence individuals who were close to 
him during the time period charged in this case and who might be witnesses against him at a trial. 
By way of background, on or about November 28, 2018, the Miami Herald began publishing a 
series of articles relating to the defendant, his conduct, and the circumstances of his prior 
conviction and the non-prosecution agreement ("NPA"). Records obtained by the Government 
from Institution-1 appear to show that just two days later, on or about November 30, 2018, the 
defendant wired $100,000 from a trust account he controlled to an individual named as a possible 
co-conspirator in the NPA. The same records appear to show that just three days after that, on or 
about December 3, 2018, the defendant wired $250,000 from the same trust account to another 
individual named as a possible co-conspirator in the NPA and also identified as one of the 
defendant's employees in the Indictment. Neither of these payments appears to be recurring or 
repeating during the approximately five years of bank records presently available to the 
Government. This course of action, and in particular its timing, suggests the defendant was 
attempting to further influence co-conspirators who might provide information against him in light 
of the recently re-emerging allegations

IV. 
The Defendant Raises Legal Arguments Not Relevant Here 
Finally, the defendant raises certain legal arguments he contends he will litigate at the 
appropriate stage and which he further suggests mitigate in favor of bail. None is meritorious, and 
certainly none should give the Court any comfort whatsoever that the defendant would, if granted 
bail, refrain from fleeing so he could attempt to vindicate himself via dubious legal strategies. 
Nevertheless, the Government will address the defendant's arguments briefly in turn. 
A. The Non-Prosecution Agreement Does Not Preclude Prosecution 
As an initial matter, as the Court itself noted at the parties' initial appearance earlier this 
week, and as the defendant appears to concede, the instant Indictment charges conduct well beyond 
the scope of the NPA — that is, alleged conduct that occurred here in New York and involving New 
York based victims. D. Tr. 6-8; Release Motion at 2. For present purposes, that alone is sufficient 
to put this issue to rest, because even assuming the defendant were to mount a meritorious 
challenge to the NPA, he would still have to stand trial on Count Two of the Indictment and 
additional charges brought based on New York conduct. 
But more generally, the reasons the defendant can be prosecuted in the Southern District 
of New York—or anywhere else outside the SDFL—are manifold. The language of the NPA 
overwhelmingly refers to the SDFL, and the core terms and text of the agreement are limited to 
the SDFL. The prefatory language states: "THEREFORE, on the authority of R. Alexander 
Acosta, United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, prosecution in this District for 
these offenses shall be deferred in favor of prosecution by the State of Florida."' The final 
paragraph of the prefatory language also states, among other things, that after fulfilling the terms 
of the agreement, "no prosecution for the [sex abuse] offenses set out on pages 1 and 2 of this 
Agreement, nor any other offenses that have been the subject of the joint investigation by the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States Attorney's Office, nor any offenses that 
arose from the Federal Grand Jury investigation will be instituted in this District." 
In its terms section, the NPA further states that Epstein's signature "is not to be construed 
as an admission of civil or criminal liability or a waiver of any jurisdictional or other defense" as 
to any victim whose identity was not disclosed by SDFL to Epstein, as provided for in the NPA, 
and additionally states that neither Epstein's signature nor any resulting waivers or civil 
settlements "are to be construed as admissions or evidence of civil or criminal liability or a waiver 
of any jurisdictional or other defense as to any person." These provisions show the parties 
contemplated possible criminal prosecutions in other jurisdictions and/or based on victims not 
initially identified in the Florida investigations (whether in Florida or elsewhere). The final 
substantive paragraph of the NPA states that "Epstein hereby requests that the United States 
Attorney for the Southern District of Florida defer [...] prosecution." 
It is well settled in the Second Circuit that "a plea agreement in one U.S. Attorney's office 
does not, unless otherwise stated, bind another." United States v. Prisco, 391 F. App'x 920, 921 
All emphases relating to the NPA are added unless otherwise specified.

Page 13 
(2d Cir. 2010) ("A plea agreement binds only the office of the United States Attorney for the 
district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates 
a broader restriction.") (citing United States v. Annabi, 771 F.2d 670, 672 (2d Cir. 1985) (per 
curiam)). Moreover, any references in an NPA to the "Government" or the "United States" do not 
abrogate these principles. Annabi, 771 F.2d at 672 ("[A] plea agreement whereby a federal 
prosecutor agrees that 'the Government' will dismiss counts of an indictment ... might be thought 
to bar the United States from reprosecuting the dismissed charges in any judicial district unless the 
agreement expressly limits the scope of the agreement .. . . However, the law has evolved to the 
contrary."). "The mere use of the term 'government' in the plea agreement does not create an 
affirmative appearance that the agreement contemplated barring districts other than the particular 
district entering into the agreement." United States v. Salameh, 152 F.3d 88, 120 (2d Cir. 1998) 
(citations and internal quotation marks omitted); see also United States v. Brown, No. 99-1230, 
2002 WL 34244994, at *2 (2d Cir. Apr. 26, 2002) (in analyzing an SDFL plea agreement, 
reiterating the holding of Annabi and noting that it applies "even if the plea agreement purports to 
bind 'the Government' or the "United States") (summary order); United States v. Bruno, 159 F. 
Supp. 3d 311, 321 (E.D.N.Y. 2016) ("The Court disagrees with Defendant's argument that the 
phrase 'United States' shows an intent to bind all United States Attorney's Offices. Rather, the 
plea agreement covers only Defendant's liability in the SDFL."). 
In sum, this issue is a distraction that has little relevance to the bail determination and does 
nothing to address the defendant's risk of flight or mitigate the danger he poses to the community. 
B. The Defendant Wrongly Argues the Statute Does Not Apply to His Sex Trafficking 
Next, the defendant wrongly argues that the "principal conduct" giving rise to the charges 
is his payment of underage girls for sex acts, and that such conduct could not possibly fall under 
the charged statutes. As the defendant implicitly concedes, Release Motion at 14, this is an issue 
for a motion to dismiss. Nevertheless, the defendant's argument is incorrect for two reasons. 
First, although the defendant undoubtedly participated on the demand side of the crime, he 
was also instrumental on the supply side given his role in recruiting and causing others to recruit 
additional victims. He organized, funded, and perpetuated a sex trafficking scheme in two states, 
including with co-conspirators. The fact that he did so for his own eventual and frequent sexual 
gratification does not vitiate his role in enticing and recruiting victims, consistent with the elements 
of the offense with which he is charged. The defendant was the leader of a sex-trafficking 
enterprise, not a mere consumer. 
g This analysis similarly extends to a non-prosecution agreement. See United States v. Laskow, 
688 F. Supp. 851, 854 (E.D.N.Y. 1988) ("Defendant's argument, in effect, is that unless there is 
an explicit statement to the contrary, it is presumed that a non-prosecution agreement binds offices 
of the United States Attorney that are not parties to the agreement. This position is at odds with 
the law in this Circuit, which presumes a narrow reading of the boundaries of a plea agreement 
unless a defendant can affirmatively establish that a more expansive interpretation was 
contemplated.") (citing Annabi, 771 F.2d at 672).

Second, he is also wrong on the law. Courts have found that Section 1591 applied to both 
suppliers and consumers of commercial sex acts. See, e.g., United States v. fingers, 702 F.3d 
1066, 1069 (8th Cir. 2013) (upholding the conviction of a defendant who attempted to pay for oral 
sex from an underage girl and explaining: "The sole issue raised on appeal is whether '[t]he plain 
and unambiguous provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 1591 apply to both suppliers and consumers of 
commercial sex acts.' We conclude they do.") (alteration in original). The lone case cited by the 
defendant, Flom v. Taylor, No. 11 Civ. 8573, 2012 WL 13042630 (S.D.N.Y. July 2, 2012), relied 
heavily on the statutory interpretation undertaken by two district courts in the District of South 
Dakota, United States v. Bonestroo, No. 11 Cr. 40016, 2012 WL 13704 (D.S.D. Jan. 4, 2012), and 
United States v. Jungers, 11 Cr. 40018, 2011 WL 6046495 (D.S.D. Dec. 5, 2011), both of which 
were explicitly overruled by the Eighth Circuit decision in Jungers, 702 F.3d 1066. In the seven 
years since Fierro has been decided, it does not appear to have been cited by a single other court. 
Additionally, other cases in this Circuit and elsewhere have upheld convictions of procurers or 
customers. See United States v. O'Connor, 650 F.3d 839 (2d Cir. 2011) (upholding convictions 
under Section 1591 of both the buyer and seller of a child); United States v. Cook, 782 F.3d 983 
(8th Cir. 2015) (rejecting a constitutional challenge that Section 1591 would be void for vagueness 
if applied to purchasers); United States v. Mikoloyck, No. 09 Cr. 036, 2009 WL 4798900 (W.D. 
Mo. Dec. 7, 2009) ("contrary to defendant's argument, 18 U.S.C. § 1591 clearly applies to those 
who attempt to purchase underage sex, not merely the pimps of actual exploited children") (citing 
United States v. Roberts, 174 F. App's 475 (11th Cir. 2006) (in which defendant was convicted 
under sections 1591(a) and 1594(a) even though no actual children were involved)). 
CONCLUSION 
As set forth above, the defendant's proposed bail package is insufficient and insubstantial. 
Pretrial Services, victims, and the Government all recommend pretrial detention due to the unusual 
and concerning confluence of factors in this case, including the defendant's extraordinary wealth, 
demonstrated willingness to interfere with victims and witnesses, continued possession of lewd 
photographs of young females, and both the incentive and means to flee prosecution.
