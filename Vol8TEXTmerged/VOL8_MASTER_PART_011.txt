jury testimony, court testimony, or preparation for same. NB: as to grand jury, this applies only in 
the relatively infrequent occasions where time in the grand jury has been scheduled and the witness 
is intended to testify. Any other witness travel for investigative interviews must be covered by the 
investigating component from litigative funds (it is generally more common for investigators to 
travel to the witness). See 28 C.F.R. Part 21, Witness Fees; USAP 3-19.000, Fact Witnesses and

Attached is a draft of the factual statement, just so that you can better understand the facts that we are 
presenting. 
We feel that given 
abuse, and given the fact that we see her basically as a cog in Epstein's wheel, 
acting entirely at his direction and doing what she did at a time that she herself was a very vulnerable victim, a 
non-pros would be the appropriate disposition. But we want to discuss this with you before we finalize this and 
make a submission.

Similar to prior requests in connection with the Epstein investigation (2018R01618), we'd like to please request 
permission to travel next week for an interview in West Palm Beach on November 4. It will just be me and 
and 
we'll travel some combination of the 3rd to the 5th. And also same as last time, we'd like to ask permission to reserve a 
conference room at the hotel on that Monday for the interview, please.

Again in connection with the Epstein investigation (2018R01618), we'd like to please request permission to travel next 
week for a victim interview in Los Angeles. As of now we tentatively expect to fly down Wednesday and return no later 
than Friday (and will keep the timeframe as short as scheduling allows). The trip will be some combination of me, M, 
and/or 
as previously. And also same as last time, we'd like to ask permission to reserve a conference room at 
the hotel on Thursday for the interview, please.

Again in connection with the Epstein investigation, we'd like to please request permission to travel for approximately 
three days next week for meetings and interviews in West Palm Beach, Florida. As of now we tentatively expect to fly 
down Tuesday night and return on Wednesday or Thursday (and will keep the timeframe as short as scheduling allows). 
Unfortunately we're still trying to pin down timing for interviewing the victims, so depending on the timing it will either 
be me and 
or 
and 
but we wanted to ask for permission now either way so we weren't doing it 
super last minute after the holiday on Tuesday. And also same as last time, we'd like to ask permission to reserve a 
conference room at the hotel for the interviews, please.

These look great. One quick question, on documents in native format (excel files) is there a confidential 
stamp? I've checked and it seems the answer is no but I just want to be sure that I'm not missing anything.

1. 
Yes, we want to mark all of them confidential 
2. 
We are working on that. 
3. 
I suppose database load files? We want to retain the files as they are currently formatted as best we can. 
4. 
That won't be an issue. I don't think we will be searching through them; the purpose is just to be able to stamp 
them. 
Thanks!

I know you want to produce these documents can you please tell me the following: 
1. 
Will you placing a Confidential stamp on these documents? 
2. 
What bates number do you wish to use on the documents? 
3. 
How do you want to produce the documents (single page tiff images, database load files or PDF production). 
4. 
Also please note that once the documents have been loaded to Relativity there is no way to run any searches for 
these images since they are mostly images and video. 
Please let me know if there are any questions. 
Thank you.

Hey—,

We have some materials that we need uploaded to Relativity to the Epstein database for the purpose of stamping them. 
The files in question number about 40,000 and are about 300GB in size. They are currently copying onto a drive to be sent 
to Relativity and should be ready by tomorrow. Do you want to see them first or can they go directly to PAE?

No way to put a confidential stamp on a excel file. There should be an image placeholder that says document produced in 
native format which has the confidential stamp.

1. 
Yes, we want to mark all of them confidential 
2. 
We are working on that. 
3. 
I suppose database load files? We want to retain the files as they are currently formatted as best we can. 
4. 
That won't be an issue. I don't think we will be searching through them; the purpose is just to be able to stamp 
them. 
Thanks!

Hey =, 
We have some materials that we need uploaded to Relativity to the Epstein database for the purpose of stamping them. 
The files in question number about 40,000 and are about 300GB in size. They are currently copying onto a drive to be sent 
to Relativity and should be ready by tomorrow. Do you want to see them first or can they go directly to PAE?

Dear investigators, 
Came across a purported video of Epstein's suicide (leaked by anonymous source). I attached it, but if your email strips 
attachments, you can also download it from Google Drive here: 
https://drive.google.com/file/d/lwKRXM8s17RujKXWnGfwqvTr- oOjHAvN/view 
Is this real??? There is another version, better quality less choppy (as my re-encoding software seems to have made it 
choppy). 
I have been documenting a substantial cover-up of a suicide scandal at FDC Miami by both the BOP and also high-level 
DOJ officials, so I find it to be a joke that the DO1 is bringing charges in this SDNY case concerning the Epstein suicide while 
simultaneously acting to illegally cover up misconduct in other similar cases. I have network of sources and based upon 
the information they have provided me, I was able to trace some of the incidents at FDC Miami as follows: 
#15412-104 Latitia Houser, Suicide in SHU (hanging), 2018-11-14 
#17880-104 Orlando Lorenzo, Attempted Suicide in Unit 8 WEST, approximately August 2019 
#17883-104 Pedro Rene Gonzalez, Suicide in SHU (hanging), 2019-08-24 
#14325-104 Anibal Mustelier, Suicide in Unit 7 EAST (hanging), 2020-09-18 
#00000-000 Suicide/Death Unit 9 EAST approximately Feb 2021 (Inmate name unknown) 
#00000-000 Suicide/Death SHU approximately Feb 2021 (Inmate name unknown) 
#00000-000 Suicide/Death, Inmates witnessed body being removed in body bag approximately 2 days ago. 
There may be other deaths/suicides that I don't know of, but certainly there are numerous other attempted 
(unsuccessful) suicides at FDC Miami due to substantial corruption by BOP, DO1, Court, Prosecutors and Defense 
Counsels. In one instance the inmate was found brain dead (but still alive) so they rushed him to a hospital to make sure 
he died at the hospital (so that they didn't have to count him as one of the dead at the prison). The situation is so bad 
that even as I continue to investigate this matter (while the government instead acts to cover it up), I continue to run 
across inmates who express suicidal ideations and still (even with the Attorney General and FBI directly involved in this 
investigation) they refuse to place the inmates on suicide watch and are still gambling with their lives. The decision to 
gamble with these inmate's lives is not being made by some low-level guards who refused to do their rounds, but rather 
by the FBI Director, Attorney General, BOP Director (which are job positions that are subject to "rolling coverup" and thus 
even though new individuals are installed into these positions, they are still somehow compelled to cover up crimes of 
their predecessors). So there is a unit of the FBI (overseen by the Attorney General) which is conducting a 24/7 
surveillance operation over the FDC Miami because of several sensitive cases involving FBI corruption (that they are 
fearful will come out) and they are witnessing the suicide epidemic in real-time and even when receiving information 
about inmates threatening suicide in real time (through this illegal surveillance operation that they are trying to cover up 
its existence), they still let the inmates return to their cells unsupervised and without following protocol to immediately 
place them on suicide watch (as is required). And these people are killing themselves and once the FBI is implicated in 
prior knowledge of their threats to suicide, they engage cover up immediately (which I have been actively documenting 
since 2019). 
How does the DOJ explain that? 
EFTA00028840
--- PAGE 2 ---
The DOJ has absolutely no credibility to investigate/prosecute employees of the BOP in SDNY while at the same time in 
SDFL, the Attorney General, the FBI Director, SDFL Prosecutors Office are directly obstructing the 
investigation/prosecution of an even more serious suicide scandal occurring at FDC Miami for which they are all 
responsible together (because they were certainly aware of it when Pedro Gonzalez killed himself a short time after 
Epstein). You cannot be credible in New York when you are committing this level of crimes in Florida (on the same exact 
category of cases). Furthermore, the very first case I investigated (which started my investigative career) was a BOP 
scandal at Rochester Minnesota which occurred from January to May of 1998 concerning the physical abuse of Sheikh 
Omar Abdel Rahman by prison guards (in an illegal conspiracy run by directors from Washington DC, ultimately resulting 
in the 911 attacks). I think god is trying to tell America that the conditions occurring in the jails are absolutely the best 
measure of the moral worth of an entire society. What type of message is America intending to send to the entire 
universe when we take people (some of whom commit minor mistakes and can be salvaged) and subject them to torture 
to the point they are killing themselves?

Following up on this, we had a call with defense counsel, who asked a number of questions I couldn't answer. Would 
you please let me know the answers to the below? 
For the nude/partially nude highly confidential images: 
• How many highly confidential images are there in total, including both from the discs and from the devices? 
• What is the format of these images? Are they all going to be viewable as thumbnails on the computer, or does 
each image have to be opened individually? 
• For the images extracted from iPhone and iPads, will the FBI please be sure to include Celebrite so the defense 
can open those files? 
• What, if any, metadata will be included with the highly confidential files? Will the metadata include information 
clarifying which device each image was extracted from? 
• Would it be possible to provide the defense with more than one laptop to review these images on? They will 
have their whole team of lawyers, the defendant, and investigators reviewing these, so they asked if it would be 
possible to have multiple laptops instead of all crowding around one. 
For the physical evidence: 
• Does the FBI have a list of all physical items in its custody for this case? The defense is eager to have such a list 
and does not seem to care if it is in the same excel spreadsheet format we previously provided. (My 
recollection from other cases is that the FBI can usually generate a list of all 1B items, so if that's possible, we'd 
be grateful for that). 
• How soon can defense counsel go to the vault to see the physical evidence? Would they be able to do so on 
Friday of next week? 
• If the defense wants to review the contents of VHS tapes, cassette tapes, and CDs, would the FBI be able to 
provide a space with the appropriate players for them to view the contents of that media? 
Thanks,

Hi M, 
Thanks very much for chatting this afternoon. To recap: 
• By tomorrow: Please check to see whether it would be possible to prepare all of the "HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL" 
nude/partially nude images and videos from the search of Epstein's devices for Maxwell and her counsel to 
review at 500 Pearl by next Wednesday or Thursday. If that is not feasible, please let me know how much time 
you need to prepare those materials for review. 
EFTA00028846
--- PAGE 3 ---
• Please confirm that the only categories of "HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL" nude/partially nude images in our custody 
that have not been produced to the defense are (1) the images seized from Epstein's NY and USVI residences, 
which were already loaded onto a laptop and brought by the FBI to the MDC for Maxwell to review, and (2) the 
images and videos seized from Epstein's devices. 
• Attached is the inventory you all provided us detailing the physical evidence items from the FBI-Florida 
investigation. Please confirm that no items from the Florida case are missing from this index. 
• Please provide us with a similar inventory of all physical evidence items in FBI-NY custody gathered during our

App.-0806 
G4LMGIUC 
(Case called) 
THE COURT: Welcome back. I have read the papers. 
Who knows. I might have missed something, but I think I've got 
it fairly well under control. I would be pleased to hear 
anything anybody wants to tell me in addition to what you've 
already given me. 
MS. McCAWLEY: Your Honor, this is Sigrid McCawley. I 
would like to start, if it's convenient with the Court, with 
the pro hac vice motions that are pending because we would like 
counsel to be able to anticipate in these proceedings. Would 
that be all right if I started with that? 
THE COURT: I don't care. 
MS. McCAWLEY: Thank you. Your Honor, you have before 
you two pro hac vice motions. My client, 
would like to have counsel of record in the case be added as 
Professor Paul Cassell and Brad Edwards. We have presented 
those pro hacs to your Honor. This is the first time in my 
years of practice that I've had a contested one, so I've looked 
at the case law surrounding that and I think it is very clear 
that a client is entitled to counsel of choice in a case. 
In this matter she has selected these lawyers. They 
have been working with her. They had been working on this 
matter for many months now. We need them as counsel of record 
in the case now because we are going to have depositions 
throughout the country where, for example, Professor Cassell is 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00028852
--- PAGE 4 ---
App.-0807 
G4LMGIUC 
in Utah. He will be able to handle the Colorado depositions 
and things of that nature. We are here because those pro hac 
vice motions are being contested. The core piece of that is 
the argument that they should not be allowed to seek 
confidential information in this case. 
Your Honor will remember that I was before you a 
couple of weeks ago again trying to get the deposition of the 
defendant, which is set for tomorrow, but still hasn't occurred 
yet. And in order to expedite that process I agreed to the 
protective order that was put in front of the Court and I 
waived all of my objections to that in order to be able to 
facilitate and move that deposition forward. That protective 
order provides that attorneys who are actively working on the 
case can receive confidential material. 
My opposing counsel has interpreted that to mean that 
that must be a counsel of record in the case. We disagree with 
that interpretation. I wouldn't have agreed to a protective 
order knowing that they were already working on the case. If 
that were the situation, as your Honor can understand in this 
case, the majority of the material has been marked 
confidential, so it would prohibit my cocounsel from working on 
behalf of their client. 
Your Honor, I'm here to request on behalf of my 
client, 
that she be entitled to have her 
counsel of record of choice in this matter. If your Honor will

EFTA00028853

App.-0808 
G4LMGIUC 
indulge me, I would like Mr. Cassell to address his pro hac 
motion, please. 
MR. CASSELL: Good morning, your Honor, Paul Cassell. 
I'm a law professor. 
THE COURT: I don't want to hear it. Sorry. No. 
Thanks very much. 
MR. CASSELL: Thank you, your Honor. 
THE COURT: Anything from the defense. 
MR. PAGLIUCA: Yes, your Honor. Jeff Pagliuca on 
behalf of Ms. Maxwell. 
Your Honor, I have never opposed a pro hac motion in 
my 34 years of practice, so this is a first for me. But it is 
clear, your Honor, that these lawyers will be witnesses in this 
case. 
THE COURT: This we don't know. I can't make that 
determination now. Anything else? 
MR. PAGLIUCA: Yes. 
THE COURT: You may be totally right, but I don't 
know. 
MR. PAGLIUCA: Your Honor, here is the problem. This 
case is about the plaintiff's false allegations. 
THE COURT: Yes. I think I picked up on that. 
MR. PAGLIUCA: These are the lawyers that wrote the 
false allegations. 
THE COURT: I think I picked up on that, too. 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00028854
--- PAGE 6 ---
App.-0809 
G4LMGIUC 
MR. PAGLIUCA: These are the lawyers that admitted 
that these were false allegations. 
THE COURT: I know. I don't have to tell you, you 
know, there is going to be all kinds of privilege issues, all 
kinds of issues about whether or not they have to testify. We 
are not at that stage. I cannot and I will not decide that 
now. 
What else? 
MR. PAGLIUCA: There is a problem with the sharing of 
confidential information with these lawyers. These lawyers 
have both personal and professional interests. 
THE COURT: I understand that. I get that point. 
Anything else? 
MR. PAGLIUCA: No, your Honor. 
THE COURT: This is what we will do on the pro hac. 
Everybody agrees, nobody, maybe in the world, but nobody in 
this courtroom, including me, has dealt with this kind of 
problem before. That's perhaps only one of a number of issues 
that are unique about this case. That's neither here nor 
there. Clearly, the plaintiff has the right to consult with 
any lawyer she chooses. However, the materials here are 
sensitive. I don't know the extent to which they have been 
designated confidential, but I'm quite sure that a substantial 
number of them have been, by the very nature of the case, I 
guess. Let me put it this way. I want to be sure that we 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00028855
--- PAGE 7 ---
App.-0810 
G4LMGIUC 
enforce the confidentiality appropriately. 
Now, with those preliminary thoughts in mind I am 
going to deny the motion at this time because I know that there 
is a statement, some kind of a statement from the mediator in 
the Florida action. When I get a piece of paper that says the 
Florida action is dismissed, a court order or whatever, then 
this motion can be renewed. 
Also, I want an affidavit from the two lawyers that 
there is no matter in which they are personally involved, that 
they are making no claim, there is no claims, there is no 
litigation in which they are involved. The reason I say that 
is that I would not grant the application for a pro hac status 
to a party in this or a related litigation. If I get those 
affidavits and the statement about the closure of the Florida 
case in which they are a party, then the application can be 
renewed and at that point I would be probably inclined, unless 
something else comes up or unless the defense tells me 
something that I don't now know, I would grant the application 
that brings us to the order itself and the meaning of the 
order. I think active in the litigation is the key phrase. 
The plaintiff has listed the people that she considers would be 
appropriate and it's these two gentleman and I think one other 
person, and that's fine. That is the definition. 
However, I'm also going to ask the parties to agree 
upon an order that would expand the confidentiality agreement 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00028856
--- PAGE 8 ---
App.-0811 
G4LMGIUC 
to this extent, to require the plaintiff to indicate to me and 
to the defense if there is anyone else who is going to be 
active in the litigation. I'll tell you why I feel this way. 
I want to be sure that we can enforce the confidential aspect 
of that agreement, and I think that could be critical down the 
line. That's the reason for those requests. 
Now, we also have a motion to compel. 
MS. McCAWLEY: Your Honor, can I just get 
clarification very quickly because I don't want to have to come 
back to the court so I want to make sure I'm following 
correctly. Your ruling, because we have a deposition tomorrow 
that counsel was going to be assisting me with, particularly on 
the Fifth Amendment --
THE COURT: Can't have access unless I get these 
materials by then. If I do, that's something else. If I do, 
fine. Otherwise, they can't have access to the confidential 
data. They can assist. 
MS. McCAWLEY: Can I just point something out to the 
Court as well. 
THE COURT: The plaintiff can have any lawyer she 
wants. The question is the confidential materials. 
MS. McCAWLEY: Can I just point the Court to one more 
issue, because this is their protective order. They now said 
to the Court that these two individuals are witnesses or 
potential witnesses. The protective order allows in Section G 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00028857
--- PAGE 9 ---
App.-0812 
G4LMGIUC 
confidential material to go to deponents, witnesses or 
potential witnesses. 
THE COURT: That's a different issue. I have not 
dealt with that. Obviously anybody who is a witness may have 
access to the confidential material, because they have to buy 
into the confidentiality order in order to do that. But they 
are outside of it at the moment. 
MS. McCAWLEY: Your ruling is, they cannot attend the 
deposition tomorrow? 
THE COURT: They can. Anybody can attend the 
deposition that anybody wants to have, but they can't 
participate in it. They can't have access to the confidential 
material until we get this matter straightened out. Ok. 
MS. McCAWLEY: I understand, your Honor. 
MR. PAGLIUCA: Your Honor, we will be designating the 
testimony as confidential. 
THE COURT: You see. There you go. That's life. I 
can't believe that this entire testimony is going to be 
confidential. Honestly, you all are too much. Ok. If that's 
what you do, you know that's not going to work because not all 
of this stuff at issue is going be to confidential. No, no 
way. What is your name? Ok. We will deal with tomorrow's 
problem tomorrow. 
MR. PAGLIUCA: Ok, your Honor. 
THE COURT: The compel. Anybody want to add anything 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00028858
--- PAGE 10 ---
App.-0813 
G4LMGIUC 
on that? 
MS. MENNINGER: Yes, your Honor. Laura Menninger on 
behalf of Ms. Maxwell. I have taken the liberty, your Honor, 
of just making a very short little cheat sheet of the 
outstanding issues, if I may approach. 
THE COURT: Yes. It will be interesting to see if 
yours is the same as the one we have prepared. Yours is much 
longer than ours. 
MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, I'm happy to address all 
of the ones on mine. I certainly am also happy to take 
direction from the Court regarding issues that you believe to 
still be of more interest. 
THE COURT: As I say, I've read your papers. I would 
be pleased to hear anything you want to add that you think is 
not covered or you want to respond or anything like that. 
MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, one of the largest and 
most significant pieces to us are the assertions by plaintiff 
that her own communications with law enforcement are somehow 
protected by --
THE COURT: I'm prepared to deal with that. 
MS. MENNINGER: The second one, your Honor, and it 
relates somewhat to the issues already presented on the pro hac 
motions, are our requests for the fee agreements with all of 
plaintiff's various 15 or so lawyers who purport to be 
representing her. Your Honor, I can find no case law that 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00028859
--- PAGE 11 ---
App.-0814 
G4LMGIUC 
suggests that the agreements are privileged, as plaintiff 
argues. She has refused to identify when these individuals 
began their representations, the nature of the representations. 
THE COURT: There is a little confusion here, at least 
in my mind, as to what we are talking about. I certainly 
understand the two gentlemen whose applications I have just 
dealt with and the third person, who I take it is affiliated 
with the Boies firm. 
Obviously, over time the plaintiff has probably 
conferred with other lawyers. But who cares? Let's assume she 
has talked to 20 more lawyers. You want all those retainers? 
That doesn't make any sense. What is the universe we are 
talking about? 
MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, I certainly understand all 
of the members of the Boies firm that currently represent her. 
The third individual, if I understand correctly, is a gentleman 
by the name of Stan Pottinger. He is a lawyer of some renown. 
He is also an author of best-selling books. He is listed quite 
frequently on plaintiff's privilege log as being part and 
parcel of advice being given to her on, quote/unquote, media 
issues. 
THE COURT: That is one. 
MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, there are other persons 
listed on their privilege log. Many are listed as counsel for 
plaintiff, but others are listed. Attorney giving advice to 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

G4LMGIUC 
victim's 
THE COURT: Is what you want the retainer agreements, 
if there are any, whatever the arrangements are, with anybody 
on the privilege log that is listed as rendering advice? 
MS. MENNINGER: Yes, your Honor. That, I think, would 
be appropriate because some of our biggest issues concern the 
privilege log. 
THE COURT: I understand. 
What else? 
MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, we have asked for, but 
been denied by plaintiff, her own deposition testimony in the 
Florida action. In that case the Court entered a confidential 
order --
THE COURT: I'm prepared to deal with it. 
MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, the next topic are 
plaintiff's medical records. 
THE COURT: I think I understand that. There is one 
thing, though. Are there any pre-'99 medical records? 
MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, the case law is quite 
clear that injuries that were preexisting --
THE COURT: I'm sorry. Excuse me. Go ahead. 
MS. MENNINGER: Plaintiff has alleged that the 
defamation of this action triggered or caused her to reflect 
back upon her alleged sexual abuse. She has also alleged, for 
example, that many, several, three, I think, at last count, or 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00028861
--- PAGE 13 ---
App.-0816 
G4LMGIUC 
four individuals had sexually abused her prior to ever meeting 
Mr. Epstein. 
If she has evidence that she already was suffering 
from depression or some type of mental health disorder before 
meeting our client, Ms. Maxwell, or Mr. Epstein, then her 
flashbacks, if you will, could be related to other incidents 
that she has put out in the press. And she, I believe, has 
also told the press that she was in a drug rehabilitation 
facility at the time that she met Mr. Epstein. 
Obviously, to the extent she was under the influence 
of drugs, which is what she has told the press, at the time she 
met him, she persisted in being addicted to drugs during the 
time that she knew Mr. Epstein, and it certainly relates to all 
of her requests for, I believe she has requested $30 million in 
damages, your Honor, not just from the defamation, but also 
harkening back to what she claims were her years as a sex abuse 
victim. 
THE COURT: What's the basis of your statement that we 
will call it the flashback? 
MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, I believe 
THE COURT: Because, quite frankly, I was unaware of 
that. Is that my error? Are you telling me something that's 
not quite right? 
MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, I believe that is what 
plaintiff has alleged in her complaint. If you can give me a 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00028862
--- PAGE 14 ---
App.-0817 
G4LMGIUC 
moment. To the extent she is now alleging she suffers from 
emotional distress from any preexisting --
THE COURT: That's from the defamation. 
MS. MENNINGER: She claims it's from the defamation. 
However, your Honor, if she has preexisting conditions that 
were truly the cause of whatever emotional injury she claims 
that she now possesses --
THE COURT: Correct me if I'm wrong, and perhaps 
plaintiff will make it clear, my understanding is that the 
injuries alleged result from the claim of the alleged 
defamation, period. 
MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, she has claimed emotional 
distress from the defamation, yes. We are requesting evidence 
that would show that she has preexisting emotional conditions. 
THE COURT: Not from the defamation. 
MS. MENNINGER: Not from the defamation. From the 
many, many other things that have occurred in her life 
predating even her meeting Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell, as she 
has told the press, not because we told the press that. 
Your Honor, it is difficult, if not impossible, to 
address her claimed $30 million emotional distress from a 
defamation statement that was a denial of her allegations 
versus any emotional distress or emotional conditions she 
already had before any such statement was made. 
Similarly, your Honor, we have asked for discovery of 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00028863
--- PAGE 15 ---
App.-0818 
G4LMGIUC 
her claimed prior sexual abuse. She has, again, put in the 
press a number of statements regarding that, and I can't 
imagine that it is to the extent she claims privacy now, those 
might be relevant in our case both on credibility and also 
damage issues. 
Your Honor, we have asked for a lot of other 
interrogatories and documents that go to her damage claims, her 
education records, her work history. She has refused to answer 
any questions before where she has worked. She has refused to 
answer any questions about where she went to school. All of 
these are appropriate under the local rule for interrogatories. 
Finally, your Honor, we have asked for her contracts 
with media. She has refused to disclose those. She has 
refused to disclose her tax returns that show all of the 
payments that she has received from various media sources. 
THE COURT: I take it your view of any funds from the 
media would operate to reduce her damages. 
MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, it also shows her motive 
and bias in bringing this case. To the extent she has been 
paid for her stories to the media, which she has, she has 
admitted that she has been paid hundreds of thousands of 
dollars for giving these stories to the media. 
But to the extent that she is now bringing this 
defamation claim, if she is still either planning to receive 
more money from the media, she has a motive and bias to make 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00028864
--- PAGE 16 ---
App.-0819 
G4LMGIUC 
her story consistent with her previous stories. She has 
claimed $5 million in lost wages, your Honor. This is a person 
who has worked primarily as a waitress in the last 15 years, 
until her media sensational story was purchased from her by 
some British press. 
THE COURT: Anything else? 
MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, the other issues are 
addressed in our papers. We have highlighted her incomplete 
production on several fronts and her refusal to answer any 
interrogatories. So I would rest on my papers with respect to 
the other arguments. Thank you. 
MS. McCAWLEY: Thank you, your Honor. I'd like to be 
very clear here, your Honor. Discovery production, I've tried 
to do that in our papers. But listening to opposing counsel 
I'm concerned maybe she hasn't reviewed the documents we have 
produced. We have clearly produced all of the media 
communications she has, including records --
THE COURT: All the media. 
MS. McCAWLEY: All of the media communications. She 
has issued wildly broad requests in this case which we have 
complied with. We ran over 200 search terms. Her request No. 
alone seeks communications with over 100 individuals. And we 
have complied, your Honor. This is coming from the defendant 
who until Monday night, when you directed her to produce 
privileged information, has only produced two e-mails in this 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00028865
--- PAGE 17 ---
App.-0820 
G4LMGIUC 
case. 
Your Honor, we have complied with our production. We 
have produced the materials that she is saying we have not 
produced. It's incorrect. We have produced her school records 
that we have. We have produced her tax records that we have. 
We have produced all of those items that we have. 
With respect to her medical records I am going to 
direct you to the case that is cited in our brief as the Evanko 
case and it was a similar circumstance to here. It was a Title 
VII case where there were emotional distress damages being 
alleged and the Court found that the other side could not have 
carte blanche ruling over all of her medical records from the 
time she was born to the present. We met and conferred on two 
hours on their discovery requests, your Honor. We agreed to 
produce all of her medical records that we had from 1999 to 
2002 and anything else we had that was related to the sexual 
abuse she endured at the hands of the defendant and 
Mr. Epstein. We have agreed to produce those. 
We have already started producing those records from 
the various doctors, from the treating physicians. Those are 
in their production. Should they be entitled to things that 
happened prior to that? Absolutely not, your Honor. They are 
not entitled to a full-scale production of everything that's 
happened in this young lady's life. She was abused by these 
individuals. She shouldn't be reabused by having to disclose 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00028866
--- PAGE 18 ---
App.-0821 
G4LMGIUC 
things that happened prior to her time with them. Your Honor, 
we do object to the production of that material. 
THE COURT: The flashback allegation. 
MS. McCAWLEY: I think what she may be referring to, I 
have not heard that term used, I think what she may be 
referring to was the fact that this is a defamation claim and 
the person who defamed my client was also an abuser, we allege. 
So when she is defamed by the person who abused her and that 
abuser is calling her a liar, that caused her significant 
emotional distress. It's different than if some other 
individual that she had not had contact with called her a liar. 
When she is talking about a flashback, maybe that's what she is 
referring to, but we don't have the word flashback anywhere in 
our complaint. 
THE COURT: No. I made that up. 
There will be no claim by the plaintiff that the 
defamation caused her distress by making her aware or as a 
result of the prior sexual abuse. 
MS. McCAWLEY: The sexual abuse by the defendants? 
THE COURT: No. 
MS. McCAWLEY: Sexual abuse by others. 
THE COURT: Yes. 
MS. McCAWLEY: No. Sexual abuse that relates to the 
Epstein period, yes. 
THE COURT: That I understand.

MS. McCAWLEY: I think we are on the same page. 
THE COURT: I think talking about the earlier period. 
MS. McCAWLEY: Prior to Epstein, no, no, she doesn't 
have a claim with respect to that. 
THE COURT: Anything else? 
MS. McCAWLEY: Your Honor, I just want to point out 
again that our production -- you asked us to complete that. We 
have gone through and run over 200 search terms. We have 
produced all of those communications she has had with all of 
those individuals. The things that we have not produced are 
the criminal investigation records. I know your Honor is going 
to address that. I would like to be very clear there. 
The point there is that she has said in the motion to 
stay papers that she filed Tuesday that she needs to have that 
information so she can decide whether she is going to be 
asserting her Fifth Amendment privilege. Truthful testimony 
shouldn't have to be crafted, your Honor. She shouldn't need 
to know what agency is investigating her in order to decide 
whether or not she is going to be asserting her Fifth Amendment 
privilege. 
We do have with us, your Honor, for an in camera 
submission, if you would like it. That is the way that courts 
have dealt with this issue in the past. When there is a claim 
from an agency that the disclosure of that investigation could 
harm the investigation, we can submit that to you for in camera

review so you are aware of the ongoing investigation. But it 
is my view that that needs to be protected. 
As you probably know, the history of these cases with 
Mr. Epstein, there were a variety of things that went on in 
that investigation, so there is reason to keep an investigation 
in this situation protected so that they can properly 
investigate and move forward with that without being inhibited 
by other individuals. Your Honor, I would ask that that remain 
protected. It's covered by her very, very broad requests, 
which is why we had to lodge those objections. I would 
appreciate your Honor considering our arguments with respect to 
that issue. 
The other things, your Honor, that she has raised is, 
for example, she had asked for the Epstein settlement agreement 
and that was one of the things that she asked for. We agreed 
to produce that if we got the waiver from Mr. Epstein because 
we can't produce it without that waiver. 
I believe that covers it, your Honor. If you have any 
questions, I would be happy to answer them. 
THE COURT: Thanks very much. 
Thank you all for all the clarification that you've 
given me. I much appreciate it. 
With respect to the retainers and the dates of 
representation, that information will be provided for any 
attorney that's listed on the privilege log.

The plaintiff has told me that they have now supplied 
all the education and employment records that they have. 
think if there is any question about that, if the defense is 
skeptical, I would ask the counsel for the plaintiffs to make 
that statement on the record, not necessarily here, but by way 
of a statement to the Court and principally to the defendant. 
On the question of residences, that's, in my view, not 
a contention interrogatory because of the nature of this case. 
I think it's more like listing witnesses. So I would say that 
the plaintiff should supply all residences. 
The Dershowitz deposition will be produced under the 
confidentiality provision. As I read what I've been given, 
it's to be held in confidence and it will remain in confidence, 
but it will be produced. 
Yes, the tax returns should be produced. 15 years 
seems like -- I see. Ok. 15 years. 
The medical records of the period '99 to 2002 will be 
produced and the plaintiff will indicate whether that 
production is complete or, if it isn't complete, when it will 
be complete. 
As for the pre-'99 medical records, based on where we 
are at the moment, I do not believe that those are relevant. 
Because the damage issue relates, in my view, solely to the 
defamation. If that changes in any way, I will revisit that 
issue.

The criminal investigation. Any materials that the 
plaintiff has with respect to any criminal investigations will 
be turned over except for any statements made by the plaintiff 
to law enforcement authority and those statements, if there are 
such, will be submitted in camera, and I will review them. 
I hope that clears up our problems. Tell me if I have 
failed in my effort to do so. Yes, ma'am. 
MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, two quick things, I think. 
With respect to medical records, we also certainly believe that 
the period from the time the statement was made in January 2015 
until the present, because she has claimed emotional distress 
from that defamation --
THE COURT: Sure, yes. 
MS. MENNINGER: The problem is, we have asked through 
interrogatory what were the names of the medical providers 
because they have not disclosed who her medical providers were. 
So there is no way for us to tell whether the records in fact 
have been sought from and produced with respect to each of 
those medical providers. I will say that other records in the 
possession of plaintiff lists other doctors who they have not 
asked for records from or releases. 
THE COURT: Let's see if we can clear that up. 
MS. McCAWLEY: We have disclosed the names. She has 
those names. We have also disclosed records, the more recent 
records. We have not contested that.

With respect to the interrogatories, your Honor ruled 
on this previously, but there is a local Rule 33.3, which is 
why we didn't serve interrogatories in this case at this point. 
She is deposing the plaintiff in two weeks, next week, whenever 
it is, and can certainly ask those questions as well. But we 
have disclosed the names of the providers. 
MS. MENNINGER: They have not, your Honor. 
THE COURT: Look. Wait just a moment. You two are 
lawyers. Now, that is not an issue about which you should 
differ. Go over in the corner right now, both of you, and 
let's make it clear who is telling me the right story. Now. 
I take it that I misunderstood the colloquy and that 
this matter has been resolved. 
MS. McCAWLEY: Your Honor, I think there was a 
misunderstanding with respect --
THE COURT: I was sure. 
MS. McCAWLEY: Dr. Olsen has been noticed for 
deposition in Colorado already. In my view, we have disclosed 
the doctors. Ms. Menninger says that there is other doctors 
that have been disclosed in documents that we have not yet 
listed to her. I think in discovery we are finding 
additional --
THE COURT: You think you may not have discovered that 
your client has had some doctors 
MS. McCAWLEY: In the past. We are talking about 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

years and years ago. The recent doctors we have disclosed they 
have noticed for deposition. 
THE COURT: What else? 
MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, with respect to the 
employment and education records, as you heard plaintiff say, 
she has disclosed, quote/unquote, what she has. Under local 
rule 33.3, we are allowed to ask for the names of witnesses 
with knowledge at the outset of the case, and they might be 
custodians of records. We asked her who have been your 
employers. She won't tell us who her employers have been. She 
has just gone through her computer and say if I have an 
employment record I'll give it to you, but I am not going to 
tell you who her employers were. 
THE COURT: She will. 
MS. MENNINGER: Same thing with the education records. 
We asked her to list where she had gone to school and tell us 
where it is. She won't do it. Those are the things where my 
skepticism arises from. 
Largely, to the extent your Honor has ordered the 
production of whatever materials, criminal investigation 
materials that were not to be submitted in camera, those were 
the ones that involved plaintiff's statements, we would like 
the other materials that they have brought with them today to 
give to your Honor that do not encompass their client's 
statements to law enforcement.

THE COURT: I don't know whether there are such. Is 
it possible that nothing in this lawsuit is clear? Well, I 
tried to make it clear what should be produced and what 
shouldn't. Anything that has been submitted to any law 
enforcement officer by the plaintiff I will take in camera. 
Anything other than that with respect to any law enforcement 
should be produced. 
MS. MENNINGER: Thank you, your Honor. 
THE COURT: Thank you, all. I think we have the 
pleasure of your company -- do we need you next week? We are 
up to date, aren't we? 
MS. McCAWLEY: Your Honor, we have a motion with 
respect to our discovery that's set for next Thursday. 
THE COURT: That's fine. 
MS. McCAWLEY: Just before we adjourn, because 
Mr. Cassell had a question, and I just want to make sure that I 
understand, with respect to tomorrow's deposition, they are 
entitled to attend but have to leave the room if confidential 
information is disclosed? 
THE COURT: That's where we are at the moment, unless 
it changes. 
MR. PAGLIUCA: Your Honor, with regard to next 
Thursday, both Ms. Menninger and I have other matters that are 
previously scheduled and it would be impossible for us to take 
care of those matters and be here at the same time. I'm

wondering what the Court would like to do about that. 
THE COURT: First of all, you know how we play this 
game. You don't ask me first. You ask your opponent first. 
Have you done that? 
MR. PAGLIUCA: I have not, your Honor. 
THE COURT: Will you? 
MR. PAGLIUCA: I certainly will, your Honor. 
THE COURT: Now. 
MR. PAGLIUCA: Absolutely. 
THE COURT: You can go over to the corner, too. 
MR. PAGLIUCA: I think we need a corner bar on this, 
your Honor. 
Ms. McCawley, I'm wondering if we can get a mutually 
convenient date to hear that matter as opposed to next 
Thursday. 
MS. McCAWLEY: Of course. 
MR. PAGLIUCA: That was simple enough, your Honor. 
MS. McCAWLEY: Your Honor, one more thing. I didn't 
realize that my counsel can submit that stipulation to you 
because that case has been settled --
THE COURT: If I get something that closes that case 
and I get the affidavit that there are no other matters in 
which they have any claims or defenses relating to any of these 
statements, that will do it. 
MS. McCAWLEY: Your Honor, so I know, if we can submit

G4LMGIUC 
that by fax this afternoon, will they be able to attend the 
deposition tomorrow? 
THE COURT: I would think so, if I think those are 
adequate representations and so on. The statement from a 
mediator doesn't mean anything to me. Something that has a 
court sign to it. That I understand. But the mediator saying 
that it's settled doesn't work for me. 
MR. CASSELL: Your Honor, maybe Mr. Edwards could 
briefly explain Florida procedure. The case has been 
dismissed, but it does not require a Court's signature. 
Mr. Edwards can elaborate more fully on that. 
MR. EDWARDS: Sure. If I may. There are two ways in 
which a case can be dismissed in Florida. One is by way of a 
court order. The other is by way of a stipulation. That is 
what was done. There was a stipulation of dismissal signed by 
both parties, that being the plaintiff and the defendants and 
counsel, that has been done and that was dismissed. 
THE COURT: That's filed in the case. 
MR. EDWARDS: That's filed in the case and filed in 
the court. 
THE COURT: Do you have a copy of that? 
MR. EDWARDS: I can get a copy of it immediately. 
THE COURT: Give it to the defense. If they have any 
problems, they will let me know. That sounds all right to me.

Your representation sounds right. 
MR. EDWARDS: Additionally, just with respect to the 
affidavit, there needs to be an affirmation that we have no 
other claims that relate to the statements in this case. Is 
that what we are saying? 
THE COURT: I think it should be broader than that. I 
think it should be -- look. I don't think it would be 
appropriate if there is any possibility for either of you to 
being a party. That's what I'm after. And having any 
proceedings against you arising out of the situation with the 
plaintiff. I think it would be inappropriate for you to be 
counsel if you have the potentiality of being a party, either 
plaintiff or defendant, in any proceedings. If I get an 
affidavit saying that you're unaware of any claims against you 
or any intention to make a claim arising out of the 
circumstances surrounding this lawsuit, that should be broad. 
I think that would satisfy me. 
MR. EDWARDS: Ok. 
MR. CASSELL: I'll be filing those materials this 
afternoon, your Honor. My plan is to attend --
THE COURT: The defense has a thought on this. 
MR. PAGLIUCA: Your Honor, I am looking at documents 
from Florida. One is a docket sheet captioned: Epstein v. 
Brad Edwards and Paul G. Cassell, Lower Tribune Cases 15 000072 
which shows that that matter is still pending. There is

another case, as I understand it, Edwards v. Epstein and 
Rothstein, which is also pending. I can confer about this, 
your Honor. 
THE COURT: Let's do this. When do you plan to return 
to the snow fields? 
MR. PAGLIUCA: There is still snow on the ground, your 
Honor. Well, Friday night or Saturday morning is my current 
plan. 
THE COURT: That's great. Whatever the applicants 
have on this subject, please turn it over. You all can work 
out how you are going to do that. Turn it over to the defense. 
And if there is anything you want me to do, I would be prepared 
to do it tomorrow. But that way I hope we can get it cleared 
up. 
MS. McCAWLEY: Your Honor, we do have the deposition 
of the defendant scheduled for tomorrow. 
THE COURT: Then everybody will be having a nice time 
together. Maybe you can all go out and have lunch, have a 
drink, and exchange these documents and go away happy. Not 
likely, but perhaps, depending on where you have lunch. 
MS. McCAWLEY: Thank you, your Honor. 
THE COURT: Anything else? 
MS. MENNINGER: Nothing.

EFTA00028883
--- PAGE 5 ---
Ghislaine Maxwell respectfully submits this Memorandum in Support of her Motion to 
Dismiss the Superseding Indictment for Breach of the Non-Prosecution Agreement ("Motion"). 
As though it were wielding an invisible ink pen, the government adds language to its 
Non-Prosecution Agreement ("NPA") with Jeffrey Epstein that does not exist in the text, and 
then pretends no one can see the clear, unambiguous language that does appear there. The plain 
language of the NPA states, without limitation, that "the United States .. . will not institute any 
criminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein." Because the Superseding 
Indictment ("Indictment") contends that Ms. Maxwell was a co-conspirator of Epstein, the NPA, 
on its face, applies here. Thus, the government's only argument, which it makes throughout its 
opposition, is that the NPA means something other than what it says. 
In suggesting that the parties to the NPA intended to immunize only the four individuals 
specifically named in the co-conspirator immunity provision, the government flagrantly ignores 
the express statement that immunity is "not limited to" those individuals. In arguing that the 
provision binds only the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida 
("USAO-SDFL"), the government asks the Court to add the words "in this District" to that 
provision, on the thin suggestion that the parties must have meant to include the same limitation 
on location of prosecution that they included in Epstein's immunity provision, even though they 
failed to do so. And for good measure, the government asks the Court to find that the parties 
must have intended to limit co-conspirator immunity to specific statutory offenses committed 
between 2001 and 2007, even though—again—no such limitation appears in the text of the co-
conspirator immunity provision. 
Notwithstanding the bedrock principle that plea agreements are construed strictly against 
the government, the government asks the Court to simply assume that the parties intended the 
EFTA00028884
--- PAGE 6 ---
NPA to be read more narrowly than the language provides, arguing that following the NPA's 
plain language would contradict "common sense." (Opp.' 8, 16.) But a non-prosecution 
agreement is not an ordinary contract. Federal prosecutors know how to draft clear limitations 
on promises made to criminal defendants, and they have a unique obligation to do so. What 
strains "common sense" is the notion that any reasonable prosecutor who intended the NPA to be 
read as the government contends would have omitted the limitations and modifications the 
government now seeks—particularly when dealing with a defendant who sought to "resolve 
globally" his criminal liability. NPA at 2. The Court should therefore decline the government's 
invitation to rewrite the NPA to its liking, should enforce the NPA as written, and should grant 
Ms. Maxwell's Motion. 
In the alternative, the Court should permit discovery and hold an evidentiary hearing to 
determine the parties' intent with respect to the co-conspirator immunity provision. While Ms. 
Maxwell contends that the NPA unambiguously bars her prosecution here, and that neither 
discovery nor a hearing is necessary for the Court to grant this motion, the government's 
arguments regarding the NPA parties' intent simply cannot be credited without the consideration 
of evidence. Because Ms. Maxwell, as a nonparty, has no personal knowledge regarding the 
parties' intent and no access to relevant documents, she should be permitted to take discovery in 
advance of any hearing. 
I. 
The NPA Applies to Ms. Maxwell, and She Has Standing to Enforce It. 
The NPA's co-conspirator immunity provision forecloses "any criminal charges against 
any potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but not limited to" four named individuals. 
NPA at 5 (emphasis added). The phrase "potential co-conspirators of Epstein" obviously 
includes Ms. Maxwell. As the opening statement of the Indictment makes clear: "The charges 
"Opp." refers herein to the Government's Omnibus Opposition to the Defendant's Pre-Trial Motions. 
EFTA00028885
--- PAGE 7 ---
set forth herein stem from the role of [Ms. Maxwell] in the sexual exploitation and abuse of 
multiple minor girls by Jeffrey Epstein." Indictment ¶ I. The Indictment also contains two 
conspiracy counts that charge Ms. Maxwell with conspiring with Epstein. Id. 119, 15. 
According to the government, however, Ms. Maxwell's status as an alleged co-
conspirator of Epstein is somehow insufficient for an NPA that immunizes "potential co-
conspirators of Epstein" to apply to her. The government claims that there is "no evidence that 
the parties intended to confer a benefit on her in particular." Opp. 20. In essence, the 
government implausibly argues that even though the parties expressly agreed to immunize "any 
potential co-conspirators of Epstein," only those individuals whom the parties were thinking 
about "in particular" qualify for immunity. The government cites no support for the rule it has 
concocted, and case law is to the contrary. 
For example, in United States v. Florida West Intl Airways, Inc., 853 F. Supp. 2d 1209 
(S.D. Fla. 2012), where a corporation had entered into a plea agreement that immunized its 
employees, the court held that one of those employees had standing to enforce the agreement as a 
third-party beneficiary by virtue of his employment; the court did not require a showing that the 
parties thought about protecting that employee "in particular" when they agreed to immunize the 
class. Id. at 1228. Similarly, in United States v. El-Sadig, 133 F. Supp. 2d 600 (N.D. Ohio 
2001), where a Saudi prince had entered into an agreement with the government that none of the 
individuals involved in purchasing guns for two members of the Saudi royal family would be 
prosecuted, the court did not require the defendant to show that the government and the prince 
intended to immunize him "in particular"; to the contrary, as the court noted, the parties to the 
agreement did not even discuss the defendant. Id. at 604. 
EFTA00028886
--- PAGE 8 ---
Ms. Maxwell thus need not show that the parties to the NPA were thinking of her "in 
particular"; rather, it is sufficient that she falls within the class of individuals the parties to the 
NPA intended to benefit. See, e.g., Florida West, 853 F. Supp. 2d at 1228 ("the signatory parties 
unmistakably intended to confer immunity on a discrete class of corporations and individuals ... 
that could include the Defendants"). And that class is clear from the face of the NPA: "any 
potential co-conspirators of Epstein," i.e., anyone else who might be prosecuted in connection 
with Epstein's conduct. NPA at 5. 
Although the NPA expressly provides that that class is "including but not limited to" the 
four individuals named in the co-conspirator immunity provision (NPA at 5), the government 
asks the Court to disregard this plain language and instead credit a passage from the report of the 
Department of Justice's Office of Professional Responsibility ("OPR Report"2) stating that the 
line prosecutor who negotiated the NPA "believed" that only the four individuals expressly 
named in the co-conspirator immunity provision "would benefit." Opp. 20-21 (quoting OPR 
Report at 167). Regardless of the truth of this decade-after-the-fact and self-serving "belief," it 
is immaterial. By agreeing to immunize "potential" co-conspirators "including but not limited 
to" the four named individuals, the government explicitly agreed that the NPA would apply to 
any others who might be charged as co-conspirators in the future—a class that includes Ms. 
Maxwell. 
The OPR Report itself re-affirms the intent to extend immunity beyond those already 
identified as potential co-conspirators. In reviewing the negotiating history of the parties over 
this provision, the OPR Report notes that the government had not specifically contemplated other 
potential co-conspirators, yet it also demonstrates that the Epstein defense lawyers consistently 
The OPR Report, of which only the executive summary had been released previously, has been submitted as 
Exhibit 3 to the government's opposition. 
EFTA00028887

and successfully pushed back against the government's attempts to limit the scope of the 
provision. Epstein's lawyers, in fact, insisted on a proposal that would have immunized the four 
individuals, "any employee" of one of Epstein's companies, and "any unnamed co-conspirators 
for any criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation." OPR Report at 166 
n.237. Defense counsel's efforts were in line with their representations to the government that 
Epstein "wanted to make sure that he's the only one who takes the blame for what happened." 
Id. at 167 (internal quotations omitted). When the government "finally revised" the language to 
the provision that appears in the signed NPA, it obviously acceded to defense's counsel's desire 
to leave open the possibility that other "potential co-conspirators" might someday have occasion 
to invoke the immunity provision. Id. at 166. 
In addition to being irrelevant, the government's argument that Ms. Maxwell had largely 
escaped its attention at the time of the NPA is demonstrably incorrect. The government's own 
file demonstrates that the FBI had interviewed Accuser-23 in 2006 (Opp. 16 n.9; Dkt. 148, Ex. B 
(sealed)), and thus had obviously learned of Accuser-2's claims regarding Ms. Maxwell now 
included in the Indictment. Indeed, an internal FBI document expressly names Ms. Maxwell as 
one of the individuals that the FBI's Miami office "began investigating" in 2006 as part of the 
investigation that led to the NPA. (See Ex. A). Thus, the government was clearly aware of Ms. 
Maxwell at the time it executed the NPA and agreed to extend the immunity provision to "any 
potential co-conspirators." She is covered by the NPA. 
As a third party immunized by the NPA, Ms. Maxwell has third-party beneficiary status 
to enforce it. While the government cites United States v. Feldman, 939 F.3d 182 (2d Cir. 2019), 
for the proposition that "plea agreements differ from commercial contracts" (Opp. 18), the 
"differ[ence]" to which the Second Circuit was referring was that in construing a plea agreement, 
Accuser-2 is identified in the Indictment as Minor Victim-2. 
EFTA00028888
--- PAGE 10 ---
courts hold the government to an even higher standard than parties to a commercial contract. 
Feldman, 939 F.3d at 189 (describing "meticulous standards of performance" to which 
prosecutors are held in negotiating plea agreements). As the government acknowledges, at least 
three courts have applied the third-party beneficiary doctrine to confer standing on third parties 
to enforce immunity provisions in plea agreements. Florida West, 853 F. Supp. 2d at 1228; El-
Sadig, 133 F. Supp. 2d at 608-09; United States v. CFWConst Co., 583 F. Supp. 197, 203 
(D.S.C. 1984), aff'd, 749 F.2d 33 (4th Cir. 1984). The government's attempt to distinguish these 
cases on the ground that they did not "analyze" the applicability of the third-party beneficiary 
doctrine to plea agreements (Opp. 19) is utterly nonsensical. As demonstrated in Ms. Maxwell's 
opening memorandum ("Mem."), all three courts expressly held that the doctrine applies. Mem. 
16-17. 
The lone case cited by the government to the contrary does not suggest a different result 
here. In United States v. Mariamma Viju (01), the court held that a third party may not enforce 
rights under a plea agreement "[w]here the defendant himself can obtain relief" from a broken 
plea deal." No. 3:15-CR-0240-B, 2016 WL 107841, *4 (N.D. Tex. Jan. II, 2016). Here, 
Epstein cannot obtain relief for the government's breach of the NPA; not only is he deceased, but 
he served the sentence stemming from his guilty plea long before his death, paid millions of 
dollars to accusers under the NPA's claims provision, and thus would have had no occasion to 
enforce the NPA by withdrawing his guilty plea. Nor is it clear that Epstein could have 
withdrawn his plea had the NPA been breached while he was serving his sentence, given that the 
NPA—unlike a plea agreement—was not submitted to the state court in which Epstein entered 
his plea. 
EFTA00028889
--- PAGE 11 ---
In sum, the Indictment itself establishes Ms. Maxwell as a "potential co-conspirator of 
Epstein," and the clear weight of authority vests her with standing to enforce the co-conspirator 
immunity provision as a third-party beneficiary. 
II. 
The Co-Conspirator Immunity Provision is Not Limited to the SDFL. 
Ms. Maxwell demonstrated in her opening brief that the NPA, read as a whole, creates an 
affirmative appearance that the parties intended the co-conspirator immunity provision—unlike 
Epstein's immunity provision—to apply outside the Southern District of Florida ("SDFL"). In 
arguing that the NPA's selective use of language limiting the scope of Epstein's immunity 
applies to the entire NPA, the government inverts fundamental principles of contract law and 
asks the Court to read nonexistent limitations into the NPA. The government then, incredibly, 
proceeds to fault Ms. Maxwell—a nonparty to the NPA—for failing to possess and produce 
evidence regarding the parties' intent in negotiating the agreement. While the text of the NPA, 
read using basic principles of contractual interpretation, unambiguously prohibits the 
government from prosecuting Epstein's potential co-conspirators in any district, to the extent that 
the Court finds it necessary to consider extrinsic evidence, that evidence is in the hands of the 
government and Epstein's attorneys—and thus Ms. Maxwell should be permitted to obtain it 
through discovery. 
The government argues that application of the co-conspirator immunity provision beyond 
the SDFL is barred by United States v. Annabi, 771 F.2d 670 (2d Cir. 1985) (per curiam), in 
which the Second Circuit stated that "[a] plea agreement binds only the office of the United 
States Attorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the 
agreement contemplates a broader restriction." Id. at 672.4 Ms. Maxwell's opening brief 
Contrary to the government's suggestion, no court has held that an "affirmative[] appear[ance]" requires an explicit 
"promise to bind other districts." See Opp. 4. Rather, in interpreting a plea agreement, "[t]he court looks to the 
EFTA00028890
--- PAGE 12 ---
demonstrated that the NPA, as a whole, gives rise to such an appearance—and the government 
offers no reasonable alternative interpretation. 
Unlike Annabi and its progeny, the NPA here contains significant evidence of the parties' 
intent to apply the co-conspirator immunity provision outside the SDFL. While the provision 
granting immunity to Epstein himself expressly limits his immunity to prosecutions "in this 
District," NPA at 2, the co-conspirator immunity provision contains no such limitation. 
"[W]here contract provisions use different language, courts must assume the parties intended 
different meanings." Bank of New York Mellon Trust Co. v. Morgan Stanley Mortg. Capital, 
Inc., 821 F.3d 297, 309 (2d Cir. 2016); see also Collins v. Univ. of Notre Dame Du Lac, 929 F.3d 
830, 841 (7th Cir. 2019) (noting "common, if not automatic presumption" that "when parties to 
the same contract use such different language to address parallel issues, it is reasonable to infer 
that they intend this language to mean different things") (internal punctuation and citation 
omitted); Penncro Assocs., Inc. v. Sprint Spectrum, L.P., 499 F.3d 1151, 1156-57 (10th Cir. 
2007) (same). Thus, the appropriate inference here is that the parties intended to limit Epstein's 
immunity, but not immunity for potential co-conspirators, to prosecutions in the Southern 
District of Florida ("SDFL"). 
The government offers no reasonable alternative explanation for the contrasting language 
in the two provisions. Instead, it argues that because the parties limited Epstein's immunity to 
the SDFL, they must have meant to limit co-conspirators' immunity to the SDFL as well, but 
must have forgotten to include the appropriate language. This argument—that the use of 
different language in parallel provisions compels an inference that identical, rather than different 
meanings, are intended—turns fundamental contract interpretation on its head. See, e.g., Bank of 
reasonable understanding of the parties as to the terms of the agreement." United States v. Gonzalez, 93 F. App'x 
268, 270 (2d Cir. 2004) (internal citations and emphasis omitted). 
EFTA00028891
--- PAGE 13 ---
New York Mellon Trust Co., 821 F.3d at 309; Collins, 929 F.3d at 841; Penncro Assocs., 499 
F.3d at 1156-57. Here, the NPA contains only two immunity provisions: one for Epstein, which 
is expressly limited to the SDFL, and one for co-conspirators, which is not. The government's 
claim that this distinction reflects an intent to apply the limitation universally strains credulity.5
It is simply inconceivable that any reasonable prosecutor who intended to limit the co-
conspirator immunity provision to the SDFL—and who had thought to include precisely such 
limiting language in Epstein's immunity provision—would have found it unnecessary to include 
identical language in the co-conspirator immunity provision. Indeed, the omission reveals an 
intent not to so limit that provision. 
Ms. Maxwell's opening memorandum pointed out a second indication in the text of the 
NPA that the parties intended to apply the co-conspirator immunity provision outside the SDFL: 
where a provision in the NPA is intended to refer only to the USAO-SDFL, it does so explicitly. 
See Mem. at 8-9 (citing examples of NPA's explicit references to USAO-SDFL). While the 
government is correct that the use of the term "the United States" in a plea agreement, without 
snore, is insufficient under Annabi and its progeny to demonstrate an intent to bind other 
districts, the NPA's references to both the USAO-SDFL and "the United States" require an 
inference that a distinction between the two is intended—and that where "the United States" is 
used, the intent is to refer to the government as a whole. Again, "where contract provisions use 
different language, courts must assume the parties intended different meanings." Bank of New 
York Mellon Trust Co., 821 F.3d at 309. The government does not even attempt to offer an 
s The government incorrectly cites to a brief filed by the USAO-SDFL in 2013 as taking the position that "the NPA 
did not bind other districts." Opp. 13 (quoting Government Brief, 08 Civ. 80736 (KAM), Dkt. No. 205.2, at 10-11 
(S.D. Fla.)). But the cited passage in that brief argued only that the NPA did not bar the prosecution of Epstein in 
other districts, which is not in dispute; it made no such argument with respect to the prosecution of potential co-
conspirators. In any event, any self-serving attempts by the USAO-SDFL to limit the NPA's applicability years 
after it was executed—after the NPA had been widely criticized and scrutinized—are no more probative of the 
parties' intent in 2007 than the arguments made by the government here. 
EFTA00028892
--- PAGE 14 ---
alternative explanation for this difference in terminology, reasonable or otherwise—presumably 
because it cannot. 
Thus, a drafting prosecutor who intended to limit the co-conspirator immunity provision 
to the SDFL clearly knew how to do so, using either of two methods employed elsewhere in the 
document. The government could have used the same language in the co-conspirator immunity 
provision that it used in the Epstein immunity provision, providing that "the United States ... 
will not institute any criminal charges in this District against any potential co-conspirators of 
Epstein." It did not. Alternatively, it could have referred expressly to the USAO-SDFL, as it did 
elsewhere in the NPA, and provided that "the United States Attorney's Office . . . will not 
institute any criminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein." Again, it did 
not. It would be absurd to conclude that a reasonable prosecutor who had used both drafting 
tools to limit other provisions of the NPA, yet failed to use either of them in the co-conspirator 
immunity provision, intended to impose the same limitations on the co-conspirator immunity 
provision—let alone that Epstein would reasonably have understood this intent. 
The government's inability to provide a reasonable alternative explanation for its use of 
different language in the different provisions of the NPA removes any potential ambiguity from 
the co-conspirator immunity provision. But to the extent there remains any doubt, plea 
agreements must be construed "strictly against the government," Feldman, 939 F.3d at 189 
(internal citations omitted), and the government is held "responsible for imprecisions or 
ambiguities in the agreement." United States v. Padilla, 186 F.3d 136, 142 (2d Cir. 1999). 
While the government argues that Annabi relieves it of this responsibility where the 
"imprecisions or ambiguities" relate to the geographic applicability of a plea agreement (Opp. 6 
n.2), it cites no authority for this proposition. While Annabi requires an affirmative appearance 
I0 
EFTA00028893
--- PAGE 15 ---
that the NPA is binding outside the SDFL, any ambiguity as to whether such an appearance 
exists must still be resolved against the govemment.6
Nor does the idea that the government agreed to broader immunity for Epstein's potential 
co-conspirators than for Epstein himself "strain[] common sense," as the government argues. 
See Opp. 8. According to the OPR Report, the line prosecutor stated that her office "considered 
Epstein to be the top of the food chain, and we wouldn't have been interested in prosecuting 
anyone else." OPR Report at 70. She also reportedly said that Epstein "wanted to make sure 
that he's the only one who takes the blame for what happened." Id. at 167 (internal quotations 
omitted). And Epstein and his counsel were clearly aware that the investigation had extended 
beyond the SDFL and involved New York-based witnesses. Under such circumstances, any 
competent defense lawyer would have sought the broadest immunity possible for Epstein's 
potential co-conspirators, in order to limit the potential that he would become embroiled in the 
prosecution of a third party—and in fact, Epstein did not agree to the NPA until the co-
conspirator immunity provision was included. And it is entirely logical that the government 
agreed to a broader immunity for potential co-conspirators, whom it had no interest in 
prosecuting, than for Epstein himself, who was the sole focus of the government's prosecution 
efforts. This outcome is consistent with the language of the NPA. 
The text of the NPA, read as a whole, thus creates an affirmative appearance that the co-
conspirator immunity provision is not limited to the SDFL, and it is unnecessary for the Court to 
Notwithstanding the mountain of authority, in this Circuit and elsewhere, articulating the exacting standards to 
which the government is to be held in negotiating a plea agreement, the government implies that such standards 
somehow do not apply when the plea agreement is enforced by a third party. Opp. 6 n.2. This suggestion is 
unsupported by any authority, and the government offers no explanation why its promises of third-party immunity 
should be held to a lower standard than other provisions of a plea agreement. 
EFTA00028894
--- PAGE 16 ---
consider extrinsic evidence of the parties' intent.' To the extent that the Court finds that 
extrinsic evidence is relevant, however, the government's argument demonstrates precisely why 
the Court should permit discovery in this action. While the government ludicrously faults Ms. 
Maxwell for failing to produce "documentary evidence" of the parties' intent and the scope of 
the SDFL investigation (Opp. 10), Ms. Maxwell, as a nonparty to the NPA, has no access to such 
evidence without discovery. Any evidence of the parties' intent would be in the possession of 
the government and Epstein's counsel, and at this stage, Ms. Maxwell can only scour the few 
clues available to the public—such as a privilege log filed in a related civil lawsuit-for crumbs 
of information about the negotiation and investigation. 
The government's response to those crumbs illustrates why any consideration of extrinsic 
evidence—which, as noted above, is unnecessary given the unambiguous text of the NPA—
should be preceded by discovery. In her opening memorandum, Ms. Maxwell cited to three 
pages from the above-referenced privilege log in a civil lawsuit filed by one of Epstein's victims, 
all of which contain entries reflecting the USAO-SDFL's consultation with the United States 
Attorney's Office for this District, travel by USAO-SDFL attorneys to New York, or interviews 
and/or subpoenas of New York-based witnesses. Mem. at 11 (citing Privilege Log, Doe v. 
United States, Case No. 9:08-CV-80736 (S.D. Fla.), Dkt. No. 212-1 (filed July 19, 2013) 
("SDFL Privilege Log"), at 4, 5, 7). In response, the government has focused on only one of 
those three entries and produced the documents referenced in the privilege log. See Opp. 10. 
The government's argument that a United States Attorney lacks the "authority" to bind other districts (Opp. 13-
14)—and that the government can simply walk away from a plea agreement in which a United States Attorney has 
not received the approvals prescribed by internal Justice Department guidelines—is unavailing. The government 
cites no case in which a court has invalidated a plea agreement on this basis, and its argument is contradicted not 
only by the Third, Fourth, and Eighth circuits—in which the default rule is that plea agreements bind other 
districts—but also by the Second Circuit's statement that a United States Attorney may bind other districts in a plea 
agreement if there is an affirmative appearance to that effect. United States v. Gebhie, 294 F.3d 540, 54749 (3d 
Cir. 2002); United States v. Van Thornout, 100 F.3d 590, 594 (8th Cir. 1996); United States v. Harvey, 791 F.2d 
294, 303 (4th Cir. 1986); Annaba, 771 F.2d at 672. 
EFTA00028895
--- PAGE 17 ---
The other two documents remain unavailable to Ms. Maxwell—as, presumably, do other 
documents whose existence cannot be discovered in the public record. Nor has Ms. Maxwell 
had the opportunity to question those involved in the investigation and negotiation. It is patently 
unreasonable for the government to blame Ms. Maxwell for failing to produce evidence relating 
to the investigation and negotiation leading up to the NPA, while simultaneously opposing her 
request for discovery and cherry-picking its responses to the limited publicly available 
information she has been able to identify. That limited information has already yielded 
supportive documents and more will no doubt follow with further discovery. 
III. 
The Co-Conspirator Immunity Provision Is Not Limited to the 2001-07 Time Period 
or to Violations of Specific Statutes. 
The government's argument that the co-conspirator immunity provision does not apply to 
the time period or the offenses charged in the Indictment consists of (i) asserting that the NPA 
says things it does not, in fact, say and (ii) attacking a strawman position, never asserted by Ms. 
Maxwell, that the NPA gives Ms. Maxwell carte blanche immunity from federal prosecution for 
all past and future criminal conduct of any kind, wherever and whenever committed. The co-
conspirator immunity provision simply does not contain the limitations the government now 
seeks to attribute to it, and Ms. Maxwell's position that it prohibits the Mann Act charges against 
her is entirely reasonable, 
First, the government's assertion that "the NPA contains detailed provisions that limit the 
scope of the crimes immunized in the agreement" is simply not true. See Opp. 15. The NPA 
contains only vague limitations as to the scope of Epstein's immunity, and no limitations 
whatsoever as to the scope of immunity for potential co-conspirators. 
To be clear, Ms. Maxwell does not assert that the NPA forecloses the perjury counts of the Indictment, which arise 
out of alleged post-NPA conduct. 
EFTA00028896
--- PAGE 18 ---
As to Epstein, the NPA prescribes immunity for three categories of offenses: (i) "the 
offenses set out on pages 1 and 2 of this Agreement"; (ii) "any other offenses" that were the 
subject of the loint investigation" by the FBI and the USAO-SDFL; and (iii) "any offenses that 
arose from the Federal Grand Jury investigation." NPA at 2. The government's assertion that 
the NPA bars prosecution only for "the specific offenses enumerated in the NPA" (Opp. 15-16) 
deliberately ignores the second and third categories listed above. The second category is 
significant because, contrary to the government's argument, the NPA does not purport to "list[] 
each and every statutory offense under investigation" (see Opp. 15); rather, it states only that the 
investigation involved offenses "including" those enumerated. NPA at 1. Moreover, the NPA 
expressly states that the joint investigation included not only offenses committed from 
approximately 2001 to 2007, but also "Epstein's background.s9 Id. The scope of the third 
category—offenses that arose "from the Federal Grand Jury investigation"—is completely 
unknown, as the NPA neither defines the term "Federal Grand Jury investigation" nor describes 
its scope. But the text of the NPA provides no basis for the government's assertion that Epstein 
was immunized only as to the specific offenses enumerated on the first two pages. 
As an example, the USAO-SDFL acknowledges that it interviewed Accuser-2 as part of 
its investigation. Opp. 16 n.9. Thus, the USAO-SDFL obviously was aware of the allegations 
by Accuser-2 against Epstein as set forth in the Indictment, allegations that entail the 1994-97 
time period at issue in this case and the offenses with which Ms. Maxwell is charged. If the 
NPA were strictly limited to the 2001-07 time period and to the specific offenses enumerated, as 
Contrary to the government's argument, Ms. Maxwell does not contend that the NPA "immunize[d] Epstein for his 
`background.'" See Opp. 16 n.9. On its face, however, it immunized Epstein for offenses that were the subject of 
the joint investigation—an investigation that, according to the NPA, included Epstein's background. NPA at 1. To 
the extent that the joint investigation of Epstein's background uncovered offenses prior to 2001 (such as the conduct 
underlying the charges against Ms. Maxwell here), the plain language of the NPA immunized Epstein from 
prosecution for those offenses. 
EFTA00028897
--- PAGE 19 ---
the government claims, it would not have precluded even the SDFL from bringing charges 
arising out of Accuser-2's allegations of conduct in the 1990s. The government cannot seriously 
make such an argument. 
Even the vague contours of the limitations on Epstein's immunity, however, are absent 
from the co-conspirator immunity provision. And while the government claims it would be 
"exceedingly strange" to interpret the co-conspirator immunity provision more broadly than 
Epstein's immunity provision (Opp. 16), as explained in Part H above, such an interpretation is 
entirely consistent with the government's focus on Epstein vis-à-vis potential co-conspirators. It 
would be "exceedingly strange," however, for a federal prosecutor who intended to limit co-
conspirator immunity to specific conduct or specific offenses to omit such limitations from the 
text of an immunity provision in a non-prosecution agreement. 
Unable to explain the absence of such limiting language, the government resorts to the 
reductio ad absurdum argument that unless the Court writes into the NPA the language the 
government now wishes had been included in 2007, Ms. Maxwell can claim that "she is immune 
from prosecution for any federal crime, during any time period, anywhere, in the United States." 
Opp. 3 (emphasis in original). Ms. Maxwell makes no such argument, and a faithful 
interpretation of the NPA leads to no such conclusion. Ms. Maxwell contends only that a 
provision that immunizes "potential co-conspirators of Epstein" precludes their prosecution for 
conduct allegedly done in conspiracy with Epstein—conduct that even the United States 
Attorney for this District has characterized as a "prequel" to offenses by Epstein that the NPA 
undisputedly immunizes. See, e.g., Dienst, J., Valiquette, J., Winter, T., and Fitzpatrick, S. 
"Jeffrey Epstein Confidante Ghislaine Maxwell Arrested on Sex Abuse Charges." NBC New 
York. July 3, 2020 (https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/ghislaine-
EFTA00028898
--- PAGE 20 ---
maxwell-arrested-jeffrey-epstein-aide/2495762/). Such an interpretation, rather than an insertion 
into the co-conspirator immunity provision of arbitrary limitations designed to satisfy the 
government's interests here, is the "common-sense way to read the NPA" that the Court should 
adopt. See Opp. 16. 
IV. 
In the Alternative, the Court Should Conduct Discovery and an Evidentiary 
Hearing Regarding the Parties' Intent. 
For the reasons explained above, Counts One through Four have been brought in breach 
of the NPA and should be dismissed. The text of the NPA, read as a whole, unambiguously bars 
Ms. Maxwell's prosecution here, and the government is reduced to arguing that the parties must 
have meant to write various provisions of the NPA differently than they actually did. These 
arguments are manifestly inadequate, and they should be rejected. 
Should the Court have any doubt about the parties' intent, however, discovery and an 
evidentiary hearing regarding the parties' intent are warranted. The government's arguments 
regarding the parties' intent simply cannot be credited without the presentation of evidence. For 
example, to the extent that the scope of offenses for which the NPA immunized Epstein is 
deemed relevant to the co-conspirator immunity provision, that scope cannot be delineated 
without determining precisely which offenses might have arisen out of the investigation by the 
FBI and the USAO-SDFL (including the investigation into "Epstein's background"), as well as 
which offenses arose out of the undefined "Federal Grand Jury investigation." Similarly, the 
government's claims that the parties did not intend to confer the benefit of immunity on Ms. 
Maxwell, and that the parties intended to limit the co-conspirator immunity provision to the 
SDFL, raise issues regarding the scope of the SDFL investigation, the USAO-SDFL's awareness 
of Ms. Maxwell, and the extent to which the investigation involved this District. These issues 
EFTA00028899
--- PAGE 21 ---
cannot be resolved in the government's favor on this record, and the plain language of the NPA 
cannot be disregarded without discovery and an evidentiary hearing. 
The government argues that Ms. Maxwell is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing 
because she has not submitted affidavits, and that she is not entitled to discovery because she has 
offered only "conjecture." Opp. 22. But unlike the cases the government cites, Ms. Maxwell has 
submitted evidence far more powerful than an affidavit claiming an oral agreement: she has 
submitted the NPA itself, which, on its face, bars her prosecution. See Feldman, 939 F.3d at 
184, 190 (hearing based on oral representations made to defendant); United States v. Aleman, 
286 F.3d 86, 91 (2d Cir. 2002) (granting hearing where defendant submitted attorney affidavits 
alleging oral agreement); United States v. Sattar, 272 F. Supp. 2d 348, 383 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) 
(same). Ms. Maxwell's contention that the plain language of the NPA reflects the parties' intent 
is not "conjecture," and the Court cannot find to the contrary without hearing evidence—
evidence that we anticipate would confirm that the parties intended the NPA to mean exactly 
what it says and that it bars the prosecution of Ms. Maxwell, but is unavailable to Ms. Maxwell 
without discovery.1°
In addition, unlike the defendants in the cases the government cites, Ms. Maxwell was a nonparty to the NPA, and 
her attorneys thus have neither firsthand knowledge of the parties' intent nor access to evidence regarding the 
parties' intent While the government points out that Ms. Maxwell has not submitted an affidavit from Epstein's 
counsel, defense counsel notes that it has made several unsuccessful attempts to obtain information from Jay 
Lelkowitz, the attorney who was principally involved in negotiating the language of the NPA on Epstein's behalf.

CONCLUSION 
For the reasons set forth herein, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that her motion to 
dismiss be granted. In the alternative, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests discovery and 
evidentiary hearing regarding the parties' intent in negotiating the NPA.

Ghislaine Maxwell respectfully submits this Reply Memorandum in Support of her 
Motion to Dismiss Counts One Through Four of the Superseding Indictment as Time-Barred 
("Motion"). 
As the government agrees in its opposition ("Opp."), the four Mann Act counts against 
Ms. Maxwell are timely only if the 2003 amendment to 18 U.S.C. § 3283 ("2003 Amendment") 
applies to the conduct charged therein. The 2003 Amendment expands the statute of limitations 
for an "offense involving" the sexual or physical abuse or kidnapping of a child. Because the 
2003 Amendment does not apply retroactively, and because § 3283 does not apply to the 
offenses with which Ms. Maxwell is charged, the Mann Act counts should be dismissed. 
First, the 2003 Amendment cannot be applied retroactively because Congress did not 
intend it to apply retroactively. While the government cites several cases in which courts have 
applied the 2003 Amendment to pre-enactment conduct, the only court to do so after analyzing 
congressional intent under the two-step framework required by Landgraf v. US! Film Products, 
511 U.S. 244 (1994)—and to even mention Congress' explicit rejection of a retroactivity 
provision in the 2003 Amendment—improperly excluded legislative history from its analysis. 
No court has applied the Landgraf framework, considered the legislative history, and still 
concluded that Congress intended the 2003 Amendment to overcome the presumption against 
retroactivity, as the government asks this Court to do. 
Because Congress' clear rejection of a retroactivity provision in the 2003 Amendment 
constitutes an express prescription of the amendment's temporal reach, the 2003 Amendment 
does not apply retroactively, and the Landgraf analysis ends at step one. Even if the analysis 
proceeds to step two, however, Landgraf does not permit the Court, without clear congressional 
EFTA00028908
--- PAGE 7 ---
direction to the contrary, to override the longstanding principle that criminal statutes of 
limitations are to be interpreted in favor of repose. 
Second, Ms. Maxwell's Motion should be granted for the separate and independent 
reason that § 3283 does not apply to 18 U.S.C. § 2422(a) or 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a), the two Mann 
Act provisions with which Ms. Maxwell is charged, because neither offense necessarily entails, 
as an element of the offense, the sexual or physical abuse or kidnapping of a child. While the 
government attempts to distinguish a long line of Supreme Court cases holding that an "offense" 
or "crime" that "involves" certain conduct means an offense that necessarily requires or entails 
that conduct, it fails to cite a single case outside the § 3283 context in which "offense involving" 
language has been interpreted otherwise—and the cases that have interpreted § 3283 as 
permitting a fact-based inquiry have failed to consider the voluminous Supreme Court authority 
to the contrary. Consideration of such authority compels application of § 3283 by reference to 
the elements of the offense at issue, and even under the definition of "sexual abuse" the 
government proposes, none of the elements of either § 2422(a) or § 2423(a) constitutes sexual 
abuse. 
I. 
The 2003 Amendment Does Not Apply Retroactively. 
The government does not dispute that Landgraf is the appropriate framework for 
determining whether a statute applies retroactively. Opp. 27. Under Landgraf, the first step is 
"to determine whether Congress has expressly prescribed the statute's proper reach"; if it has, 
there is no need to proceed further. 551 U.S. at 280. If it has not, the court must determine 
"whether the new statute would have retroactive effect, i.e., whether it would impair rights a 
party possessed when he acted, increase a party's liability for past conduct, or impose new duties 
with respect to transactions already completed." Id. 
EFTA00028909
--- PAGE 8 ---
As Ms. Maxwell's opening memorandum ("Mem.") has demonstrated, proper application 
of Landgraf prohibits retroactive application of the 2003 Amendment. Congressional intent 
could not be clearer; Congress considered and expressly rejected a provision that would have 
made the 2003 Amendment retroactive. That ends the Landgraf inquiry at step one. Even if the 
inquiry proceeds to step two, however, the government has failed to adequately rebut Ms. 
Maxwell's showing that application of the 2003 Amendment here would have impermissible 
retroactive effects. 
A. 
Step One: Congress Did Not Expressly Prescribe Retroactivity and Rejected 
a Proposal to Do So. 
1. 
Congress' explicit rejection of a retroactivity provision ends the 
inquiry at step one in Ms. Maxwell's favor. 
"[W]here the congressional intent is clear, it governs." Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 264 
(quoting Kaiser Aluminum & Chem. Cap. v. Bonjorno, 494 U.S. 827, 837 (1990)). As Ms. 
Maxwell's opening memorandum demonstrated, congressional intent with respect to the 
retroactive application of the 2003 Amendment is clear: the House version of the bill included 
an express retroactivity provision, the Senate version contained no retroactivity provision, and, in 
the words of one of the bill's co-sponsors, the House-Senate conference "agreed to drop 
language from the original House-passed bill that would have extended the limitations period 
retroactively." Senator Leahy, Amber Legislation, Cong. Rec. 149:50, S5147 (2003). The Court 
need look no further. Such an unambiguous expression of congressional intent establishes 
conclusively that the 2003 Amendment is not retroactive. 
The government argues that Congress' explicit rejection of a retroactivity provision is not 
probative, because according to Senator Leahy's floor statement, the decision was grounded in 
concerns about the revival of time-barred charges rather than the extension of live charges, and at 
least some of the charges here were live at the time of the 2003 Amendment. But to the extent 
EFTA00028910
--- PAGE 9 ---
that Congress' rejection of the retroactivity provision was motivated by such concerns,' 
Congress nonetheless chose to address those concerns by eliminating the retroactivity provision 
altogether, rather than simply modifying it to prohibit the revival of time-barred charges. If 
Congress had intended to distinguish between live charges and time-barred charges, it could 
easily have done so. Its decision to drop the provision completely demonstrates a clear intent 
that the 2003 Amendment not be applied retroactively. The Court may not override that clear 
intent merely because doing so may have been a broader measure than necessary to address the 
concerns Senator Leahy articulated.2
The government also contends that heeding Congress' specific intent not to make the 
2003 Amendment retroactive would "undermine Congress's plain purpose" in enacting it—Le., 
to extend the limitations period "to ensure that prosecutors could seek justice for child sex abuse 
victims who come forward or identify their abusers after a delay." See Opp. 31. But statutory 
amendments, by nature, are designed to remedy perceived deficiencies in existing law, and thus a 
decision not to apply any amendment retroactively will typically limit, or "undermine," the 
effectuation of that purpose. For that reason, as the Supreme Court acknowledged in Landgraf, 
an amendment's purpose is immaterial to a retroactivity analysis: 
While Senator Leahy's floor statement confirms that Congress' rejection of the retroactivity provision was 
intentional, his statement as to why the provision was rejected cannot be ascribed to other members of Congress. 
The government implicitly asks the Court to disregard the voluminous authority emphasizing the significant weight 
to be given congressional consideration and explicit rejection of a proposed statutory provision (see Mem. 7.8), 
relying solely on the Supreme Court's treatment in Landgraf of an omission from the comprehensive Civil Rights 
Act of 1991 of an "elaborate retroactivity provision" that had been included in a vetoed civil rights bill passed by a 
prior Congress. See Opp. 31 n.14 (quoting Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 256). That omission is not analogous. There was 
no indication in Landgraf that Congress had even considered, let alone rejected, such a provision in the legislation it 
ultimately enacted. Moreover, the provision from the prior Congress' bill was indeed "elaborate": it did not simply 
prescribe retroactivity, as the provision stricken from the 2003 Amendment would have done, but assigned a series 
of different effective dates to different subsections. Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 255 n.8. The absence of such a detailed 
scheme from subsequent legislation, passed by a subsequent Congress, could not be reasonably interpreted as a clear 
reflection of congressional intent regarding retroactivity, and there is no indication in the opinion that any party 
argued otherwise. 
EFTA00028911
--- PAGE 10 ---
It will frequently be true, as petitioner and amid forcefully argue here, that 
retroactive application of a new statute would vindicate its purpose more fully. 
That consideration, however, is not sufficient to rebut the presumption against 
retroactivity. Statutes are seldom crafted to pursue a single goal, and 
compromises necessary to their enactment may require adopting means 
other than those that would most effectively pursue the main goal. 
Landgraf 511 U.S. at 285-86 (emphasis added). Thus, it is not anomalous at all that Congress 
would "exempt[] all past offenders" from the new limitations period, as the government asserts 
(Opp. 31); to the contrary, the law presumes that past conduct is exempt from legislation. Here, 
Congress' clear intent that the 2003 Amendment not be retroactive resolves the Landgraf inquiry 
in Ms. Maxwell's favor at step one. 
2. 
Cases applying the 2003 Amendment retroactively are readil 
distinguishable. 
While the government cites several cases that have applied the 2003 Amendment 
retroactively (Opp. 26-27), most of those cases analyzed the issue under the Ex Post Facto 
Clause and gave little, if any, consideration to congressional intent regarding retroactivity (as 
opposed to the intent of the amendment itself). In all but one of those cases, no Landgraf 
analysis was performed, and it does not appear that Congress' explicit rejection of a retroactivity 
provision was considered or even raised.; But the government does not dispute that Landgraf is 
the appropriate framework—nor can it, given the Second Circuit's acknowledgment that the 
retroactivity of the 2003 Amendment must be analyzed under Landgraf. Weingarten v. United 
States, 865 F.3d 48, 54-58 (2d Cir. 2017). 
No Landgraf analysis was performed, nor was Congress' rejection of the retroactivity provision discussed, in 
United States v. Brown, 800 F. App'x 455, 461 (9th Cir. 2020) (discussing issue in a single sentence and referring 
only to the intent of the amendment generally), cert. denied, No. 20.5064, 
S.Ct. —, 2021 WL 78235 (Jan. 11, 
2021); United States v. Leo Sure Chief 438 F.3d 920, 924 (9th Cir. 2006) (discussing only the intent of the 
amendment generally); United States v. Jeffries, 405 F.3d 682, 684-85 (8th Cir. 2005) (no Landgrafanalysis or 
consideration of legislative history), cat denied, 546 U.S. 1007 (2005); United States v. Pierre-Louis, No. 16 Cr. 
541 (CM), 2018 WL 4043140, at *5.6 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2018) (addressing only Ex Post Facto clause); or United 
States v. Sensi, No. 08 Cr. 253, 2010 WL 2351484, at *3 (D. Conn. June 7, 2010) (same). 
EFTA00028912
--- PAGE 11 ---
The only exception is United States v. Nader, 425 F. Supp. 3d 619 (E.D. Va. 2019). In 
Nader, the court performed a Landgraf analysis in analyzing the retroactivity of the 2003 
Amendment, and it appears to be the only previous case in which Congress' explicit rejection of 
a retroactivity provision in the 2003 Amendment has even been mentioned. In Nader, however, 
the court noted the legislative history of the 2003 Amendment but held that only the text of the 
amendment was relevant to step one of Landgraf 425 F. Supp. 3d at 627 (finding legislative 
history arguments "misplaced within the first step of the Landgraf analysis, which asks only 
whether the statute at issue contains ... language unequivocally delineating the time period to 
which it applies"). 
Nader's exclusion of legislative history from the Landgrafanalysis4 cannot be reconciled 
with the Supreme Court's applications of Landgraf-or, for that matter, with Landgraf itself. 
See, e.g., Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 264 (considering legislative history); Martin v. Hadix, 527 U.S. 
343, 355-57 (1999) (examining "structure and legislative history" as part of first Landgraf step). 
And as the government acknowledges, "the Second Circuit has considered both the text of the 
statute and the legislative history" at the first Landgraf step. Opp. 28 (citing In re Enterprise 
Mortgage Acceptance Co., 391 F.3d 401, 406-08 (2d Cir. 2004)). Thus, Nader is not persuasive 
authority. 
In short, no court has considered Congress' explicit rejection of a retroactivity provision 
in performing a Landgraf analysis of the retroactivity of the 2003 Amendment. In fact, the 
government cites only three cases that have analyzed the 2003 Amendment under Landgraf at 
all: the Second Circuit and First Circuit opinions in Weingarten and United States v. Miller, 911 
F.3d 638 (1st Cir. 2018), respectively, which were ineffective assistance of counsel cases and 
Although the court in Nader explicitly characterized legislative history arguments as "misplaced" within step one 
Landgraf it also omitted them from step two of its Landgraf analysis. Nader, 425 F. Supp. 3d at 627-32. 
EFTA00028913
--- PAGE 12 ---
thus did not decide the issue (and in which Congress' rejection of the retroactivity provision was 
not discussed), and Nader, in which the court incorrectly excluded legislative history from its 
Landgraf analysis. If Landgraf is correctly applied, and legislative history is given its proper 
weight in the analysis, it is clear from Congress' rejection of the retroactivity provision that it did 
not intend the 2003 Amendment to be retroactive. Counts One through Four are therefore time-
barred. 
3. 
The government cannot prevail at step one. 
Meanwhile, the government's claim that it should prevail at step one can be easily 
dispensed with. The government relies on the language in the 2003 Amendment that "[Igo 
statute of limitations that would otherwise preclude prosecution" of a child sexual offense "shall 
preclude" prosecution during the life of the victim. 18 U.S.C. § 3283 (2003). While the 
government argues that this language refers to the pre-amendment version of § 3283, the Second 
Circuit recognized in Weingarten that "there is a more natural interpretation of that phrase that 
does not address retroactivity—that Congress intended the language in the 2003 version of 
§ 3283 to clarify that the statute prescribes a statute of limitations for applicable offenses that is 
different from the default five-year limitations period under federal law." Weingarten, 865 F.3d 
at 55. See also Miller, 911 F.3d at 644 (suggesting that "otherwise preclude" language "may 
refer only to preclusion by the five-year federal default statute of limitations"); Nader, 425 F. 
Supp. 3d at 626 (interpreting same language to "merely `signal the drafter's intention that the 
provisions . . . override conflicting provisions of any other section,'" rather than the pre-
amendment version of § 3283) (quoting Cisneros v. Alpine Ridge Group, 508 U.S. 10, 18 
(1993)). 
This interpretation is bolstered further by the presence of the same "[n]o statute of 
limitation[s] that would otherwise preclude" language in the 1990 statute that originally created 
EFTA00028914
--- PAGE 13 ---
the expanded statute of limitations for child sex abuse crimes. See Opp. Mem. 24 (quoting 
Crime Control Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-647, tit. II, § 225(a), 104 Stat. 4789, 4798 (codified 
at 18 U.S.C. § 3509(k) (1990)). In 1990, "the only existing limitations period to which the 
language could have referred was the [five-year] default limit set forth in [18 U.S.C. § 3282]." 
Miller, 911 F.3d at 644. That is the logical reading of the same provision here. 
The government cannot prevail on step one. If step one is not resolved in Ms. Maxwell's 
favor, the inquiry must proceed to step two. 
B. 
Step Two: Application of the 2003 Amendment to Ms. Maxwell's Alleged 
Offenses Would Have Impermissible Effects. 
Even if the Landgraf inquiry were to proceed to the second step—whether retroactive 
application would have impermissible effects-Ms. Maxwell should prevail. In arguing 
otherwise, the government effectively claims that in the retroactivity context, Landgraf permits 
the Court to ignore the bedrock principle that "criminal limitations statutes are `to be liberally 
interpreted in favor of repose."' Toussie v. United States, 397 U.S. 112, 115 (1970) (quoting 
United States v. Scharton, 285 U.S. 518, 522 (1932)). But nothing in Landgraf, a civil case, 
purports to limit that principle, let alone abrogate it. 
The government asserts that no court has held that retroactively extending a filing period 
for live charges is a presumptively impermissible retroactive effect under Landgraf (Opp. 35), 
but that is not so. In United States v. Gentile, 235 F. Supp. 3d 649 (D.N.J. 2017), the court held 
that it would be impermissible to retroactively extend a statute of limitations for live charges 
"absent clear legislative intent" to apply the expanded limitations retroactively. Id. at 655. In 
doing so, the court read Landgraf in conjunction not only with Toussie but also with Hughes 
Aircraft Co. v. U.S. ex rel. Schumer, 520 U.S. 939 (1997), a post-Landgraf opinion in which the 
Supreme Court reiterated the law's presumption against retroactivity and reiterated that "we 
EFTA00028915
--- PAGE 14 ---
apply this time-honored presumption unless Congress has clearly manifested its intent to the 
contrary." Gentile, 235 F. Supp. 2d at 654 (quoting Hughes, 520 U.S. at 946 (emphasis added 
by court)).5 The First Circuit, addressing the issue on an ineffective assistance of counsel of 
claim (and thus not reaching a merits decision), issued a similar caution in the specific context of 
the 2003 Amendment: 
[W]hen Congress has sounded an uncertain trumpet, a court ought to refrain from 
applying an enlarged criminal statute of limitations retrospectively.... Seen in 
this light, Toussie potentially alters the second step in the Landgraf approach. 
Miller, 911 F.3d at 645.6
By contrast, the government cites only one case—Nader—in which a court has held that 
the application of a criminal statute of limitations to pre-enactment conduct is permissible under 
the second step of Landgraf. Like the government here, however, the court in Nader offered no 
path to reconciling Landgraf with Toussie. Instead, it applied Landgraf, a civil case, in a manner 
that interprets Toussie out of existence in the retroactivity context, without any suggestion from 
the Supreme Court that it intended such an effect. The opinions in Miller and Gentile, in 
acknowledging the need to read Landgraf and Toussie in harmony, provide the correct legal 
framework for the application of the second step of Landgraf This is particularly so in light of 
Congress' explicit rejection of a retroactivity provision in the 2003 Amendment, a factor not 
considered in Miller and absent from Gentile. 
In arguing that "Congress may retroactively extend the limitations period for still-viable 
prosecutions" (Opp. 34) (emphasis added), the government completely misses the point. There is 
The government's attempt to discredit Gentile on the ground that it relied in part on a pre-Landgraf opinion (Opp. 
36) rings hollow. The court made clear that it was applying Landgraf(in conjunction with Toussie and Hughes). 
Gentile, 235 F. Supp. at 654-55. 
For this reason, the Second Circuit's applications of Landgmf in Vernon v. Cassadaga Valley Cent. School Dist, 
F.3d 886 (2d Cir. 1995), and In re Enterprise Mortgage Acceptance Co., 391 F.3d 401 (2d Cir. 2004)—both of 
which involved civil statutes of limitations—do not resolve the issue. 
EFTA00028916
--- PAGE 15 ---
no dispute that Congress could have amended § 3283 in 2003 to extend the limitations period for 
live charges; had it done so explicitly, the government would prevail on the first Landgraf step.' 
Rather, the second Landgraf step asks whether the effects of retroactive application of a statute 
are such that the Court, in the absence of an express retroactivity provision, should presume that 
Congress intended to apply the statute retroactively. See Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 283 (framing 
issue as whether a law is "the kind of provision that [applies] to events antedating its enactment 
in the absence of clear congressional intent").8 As both Miller and Gentile recognize, Toussie 
suggests that, in the context of a criminal statute of limitations, Congress should not be presumed 
to have intended retroactive application absent a clear expression of such intent, and the Court 
should not reach such a conclusion here. 
II. 
Section 3283 Does Not Apply at All. 
Ms. Maxwell's Motion should be granted for the separate and independent reason that 
regardless of whether the 2003 Amendment can be applied retroactively, § 3283 does not apply 
to the offenses with which Ms. Maxwell is charged. Neither enticement of an individual to travel 
nor transportation of a minor is an "offense involving" the sexual or physical abuse or 
kidnapping of a child. The government fails to rebut the long line of cases interpreting "offense 
involving" language to refer to offenses that necessarily entail particular conduct, and the 
For this reason, the government's invocation of Falter v. United States, 23 F.2d 420 (2d Cir. 1928)-a case 
decided decades before both Landgraf and Toussie—adds nothing to the analysis. While the government cites 
Falter for the uncontroversial proposition the law treats the revival of time-barred criminal charges more harshly 
than the extension of live charges—indeed, as the government points out, the former raises issues under the Ex Post 
Facto Clause—it sheds no light on the issue of statutory interpretation here, particularly in light of Landgraf and 
Toussie. 
S The fact that the inquiry into a statute's retroactive effects is the second step of Landgraf, rather than the first, 
demonstrates that Landgmf is not an inquiry into a statute's constitutionality. If the Landgraf analysis were simply 
an inquiry into whether the Ex Post Facto clause permits Congress to apply a criminal statute of limitations 
retroactively, as the government contends (Opp. 34-35), the first step would have to be read out of Landgraf 
entirely. Otherwise, Congress could expressly prescribe an unconstitutional retroactive application of a statute, 
thereby ending the analysis at step one before the court ever addressed the statute's constitutionality.

offenses with which Ms. Maxwell is charged do not require the sexual or physical abuse or 
kidnapping of a child. 
A. 
Section 3283 Applies Only to Offenses that Necessarily Entail the Sexual 
Abuse or Physical Abuse, or Kidnapping, of a Child. 
As demonstrated in Ms. Maxwell's opening brief, the Supreme Court has held repeatedly 
and consistently that an "offense" or "crime" that "involves" certain conduct means an offense 
that necessarily entails or requires that conduct. See, e.g., Shular v. United States, 140 S. Ct. 
779, 782 (2020) ("a court should look to the state offense's elements" rather than case-specific 
facts); United States v. Davis, 139 S. Ct. 2319, 2328 (2019) (rejecting argument that "offense 
that ... involves" provision permitted court to look to case-specific facts, even if necessary to 
save provision from unconstitutional vagueness); Kawashima v. Holder, 565 U.S. 478, 484 
(2012) (interpreting "offenses that involve fraud or deceit" to mean "offenses with elements that 
necessarily entail fraudulent or deceitful conduct") (internal punctuation omitted); Leocal v. 
Ashcroft, 543 U.S. 1, 7 (2004) (stating that "offense that ... involves" language "requires us to 
look to the elements and the nature of the offense ...rather than to the particular facts" at issue); 
Bridges v. United States, 346 U.S. 209, 217 n.15, 221 (1953) (limiting extended statute of 
limitations for "any offense [] involving fraud or attempted fraud against the United States" to 
"offenses in which defrauding or attempting to defraud the United States is an essential 
ingredient of the offense charged"). The government's attempt to limit this clear line of cases is 
unpersuasive. 
The government claims that a "necessarily entails" approach (or, as the government 
describes it, a "categorical" approach) is "only used in settings like sentencing and immigration, 
where a court is asked to evaluate the conduct from a prior conviction." Opp. 39. While one 
would expect the government to support such a statement with citations to Supreme Court cases 
EFTA00028918
--- PAGE 17 ---
outside the sentencing and immigration context in which the "necessarily entails" approach has 
been rejected, it fails to offer any.9 Nor does the government respond to the case law cited by 
Ms. Maxwell in which courts have interpreted "offense involving" language in a venue statute, 
which has nothing to do with sentencing, immigration, or prior convictions, to refer to the 
elements of the offense. See, e.g., United States v. Morgan, 393 F.3d 192, 198 (D.C. Cir. 2004) 
("The most natural reading of § 3237(a) ¶ 2 is to construe `any offense involving' by reference to 
the elements of the offense at issue.") (emphasis in original); United States v. Ayo, 801 F. Supp. 
2d 1323, 1331 (S.D. Ala. 2011) ("The Eleventh Circuit has employed the second paragraph of 
Section 3237(a) when such transportation, or use of the mails, is an element of the offense 
charged."). The arbitrary limitations the government seeks to impose on the "necessarily entails" 
approach simply do not exist. 
The Supreme Court's opinion in Nijhawan v. Holder, 557 U.S. 29 (2009)—the only 
Supreme Court case the government cites in which the Court applied a fact-based approach to an 
"offense involving" statute—does not break this line of cases at all. In Nijhawan, the statutory 
provision at issue referred to "an offense that . . . involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the 
victim or victims exceeds $10,000." 557 U.S. at 32 (quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(M)(i)) 
(emphasis added by Court). The issue before the Court was not whether the statute required 
"fraud or deceit" to be an element of the underlying offense, but whether the referenced 
monetary threshold was required to be an element. The Court held that it was not, reasoning that 
"[t]he words 'in which' (which modify `offense') can refer to the conduct involved `in' the 
According to the government, the ostensible rationale for the "necessarily entails" approach—avoiding the need 
for courts to examine the facts of prior convictions—is not present in the § 3283 context. But a fact-based approach 
poses a different practical obstacle in the statute of limitations context. Under a fact-based approach here, for 
example, in order to obtain the benefit of the expanded limitations period, the government would be required to 
prove conduct (i.e., sexual abuse) that is not an element of an offense; a jury would be required to find not only that 
Ms. Maxwell committed the offenses with which she is charged but also that her offenses "involve[] . 
the sexual 
or physical abuse ... of a child"; and only after the jury has returned its verdict would it be known which statute of 
limitations—§ 3283 or the default provision under § 3282—applies to this prosecution. 
EFTA00028919
--- PAGE 18 ---
commission of the offense of conviction, rather than to the elements of the offense." Id. at 39 
(emphasis added by Court). Because § 3283 contains no such modification to the words "offense 
involving," Nijhawan is entirely consistent not only with the Supreme Court cases that interpret 
"offense involving" language as referring to elements of the offense, but also with a similar 
interpretation of the language as it appears in § 3283.1°
The Eighth Circuit's opinion in United States v. Coutentos, 651 F.3d 809 (8th Cir. 2011), 
squares perfectly with this approach. In Coutentos, the court held that § 3283 did not apply to a 
charge of possession of child pornography, even though the facts of the case involved conduct 
that went beyond the elements of child pornography and, according to the court, constituted 
sexual abuse. 651 F.3d at 817. The government's attempt to distinguish Coutentos on the 
ground that "this case does not involve the possession of child pornography" (Opp. 41) misses 
the point: In determining whether § 3283 applied, the court did not consider evidence of actual 
sexual abuse and instead confined its focus to the elements of the offense of possession of child 
pornography. In other words, it used the "necessarily entails" approach. Similarly, § 3283 
requires the Court here to look only to the elements of § 2422(a) and § 2423(a), and to disregard 
allegations of conduct beyond those elements. 
Finally, the government attempts to distinguish Bridges, in which the Supreme Court 
used the equivalent of a "necessarily entails" approach specifically with respect to a statute of 
limitations, and argues that Bridges is an outlier based on its legislative history. But the 
government fails to identify a single statute of limitations other than § 3283 in which a fact-
The government cites the Second Circuit's statement in a footnote in Weingarten that the "offense involving" 
language is "equally consistent with applying a fact-based approach." Opp. 39-40 (quoting Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 
n.I I). However, Weingarten relied exclusively on Nijhawan for that proposition; like the government, it cited no 
case in which a fact-based approach had been used to apply an "offense involving" statute other than § 3283. In any 
event, the Second Circuit did not hold that a fact-based approach applies to § 3283; it held only, in the context of an 
ineffective assistance claim, that it was "not obvious" which approach applies. Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 60. 
EFTA00028920
--- PAGE 19 ---
based approach has been applied, let alone one that uses "offense involving" language. I I Given 
the Supreme Court's consistent interpretation of such language to require a "necessarily entails," 
elements-based approach, § 3283 should be similarly interpreted—particularly given the 
obligation under the rule of lenity to construe any ambiguity in criminal statutes in favor of the 
defendant, Burrage v. United States, 571 U.S. 204, 216 (2014), and the principle that "criminal 
limitations statutes are to be liberally interpreted in favor of repose." Toussie, 397 U.S. at 115 
(internal quotations and citation omitted). 
B. 
The Offenses Charged in Counts One Through Four Do Not Necessarily 
Entail the Sexual or Physical Abuse or Kidnapping of a Child. 
The government appears to argue that even under the "necessarily entails" approach, 
§ 3283 applies to the Mann Act offenses at issue here, because § 2422(a) and § 2423(a) 
somehow necessarily entail the sexual abuse of a child. The government bases this argument on 
its contention that the applicable definition of "sexual abuse" is the definition found at 18 U.S.C. 
§ 3509(a)(8), because that definition "includes the employment, use, persuasion, inducement, 
enticement, or coercion of a child to engage in, or assist another person to engage in, sexually 
explicit conduct or the rape, molestation, prostitution, or other form of sexual exploitation of 
children, or incest with children." 18 U.S.C. § 3509(a)(8). But even under such an expansive 
definition, neither § 2422(a) nor § 2423(a) necessarily entails the sexual abuse of a child. 
Section 2422(a) does not necessarily entail any act concerning a child, let alone the 
"employment, use, persuasion, inducement, enticement, or coercion of a child" to engage in any 
sex-related conduct. Rather, § 2422(a) requires only the enticement of an individual—of any 
" The government also cites United States v. Schneider, 801 F.3d 186 (3d Cir. 2015), in which the court rejected the 
defendant's comparison of § 3283 to the statute in Bridges. To the extent that the Third Circuit rejected a 
"necessarily entails" approach to § 3283, it appears to have done so without considering the line of Supreme Court 
cases interpreting the "offense involving" language as requiring such an approach—a line that has since expanded to 
include Davis and Shular. 
EFTA00028921
--- PAGE 20 ---
age—to travel with the requisite intent. 18 U.S.C. § 2422(a). Section 2423(a) requires only the 
transportation of a child with the requisite intent, 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a); it does not necessarily 
entail "the employment, use, persuasion, inducement, enticement, or coercion of a child" to do 
anything other than travel. If a defendant entices an adult to travel for the purpose of engaging in 
unlawful sexual activity, a § 2422(a) offense has been committed, but no sexual abuse of a child 
has occurred. If a defendant transports a minor with the intent (unbeknownst to the minor) that 
the minor will engage in sexual activity, no sexual activity occurs, and there is no "employment, 
use, persuasion, inducement, enticement, or coercion" to engage in sexual activity, a § 2423(a) 
offense has been committed, but no sexual abuse of a child has occurred. 
While the government cites several cases in which courts have found § 3283 applicable to 
particular statutes, it cites only one case in which either a § 2422(a) or § 2423(a) offense has 
been held to involve "sexual abuse" within the meaning of § 3283. In United States v. Vickers, 
No. 13 Cr. 128 (RJA) (HKS), 2014 WL 1838255 (W.D.N.Y. May 8, 2014), the court held that a 
§ 2423(a) offense involved sexual abuse, but it did not hold that § 2423(a) necessarily entails 
sexual abuse; instead, the court used a fact-based approach. Id. at *11 ("defendant Vickers is 
charged with transportation of a minor in violation of [§ 2423(a)] and it is alleged that the 
defendant did have sexual contact with Victim I") (emphasis added). No court has held that 
either the enticement of an individual to travel or the transportation of a minor necessarily entails 
"sexual abuse" within the meaning of § 3283. It does not. The government therefore cannot and 
should not prevail.

Subpoena to Boies Schiller and to Dismiss Counts Five and Six 
12. Reply Memorandum in Support of Motion to Dismiss Counts One through Four of 
the Superseding Indictment for Lack of Specificity 
Several of the reply memoranda reference or discuss Confidential Information produced 
in discovery and are therefore redacted pursuant to paragraph 15 of the Protective Order (Dkt. 
36). In order to give the government the chance to review the proposed redactions, we will not 
file on the public docket any reply memoranda that contain redactions until we are instructed to 
do so by the Court.' 
The remaining reply memoranda do not contain any redactions. 
However, we are 
mindful of the fact that the government's Omnibus Memorandum in Opposition to the 
Defendant's Pre-trial Motions, to which the reply memoranda respond, has not yet been filed on 
the public docket. Accordingly, we will also refrain from filing the reply memoranda that do not 
contain redactions on the public docket until we are instructed to do so by the Court. 
Instead, we will submit by email to the Court and the government all of the reply 
memoranda and exhibits pursuant to Rule 2(B) of the Court's individual rules of criminal 
practice. For the reply memoranda and exhibits that contain redactions, we will submit two 
versions — an unredacted original to be kept under seal and a version for public filing with 
proposed redactions. 
Please contact us with any questions. Your consideration is greatly appreciated.

filed under seal, as required by paragraph 15 of the Protective Order. However, because some of the exhibits are 
"judicial documents," we intend to propose that those "Confidential" designations be amended consistent with our 
March 9, 2021 letter to the Court.

Ghislaine Maxwell submits this reply in support of her Motion to suppress all evidence 
the government obtained from a grand jury subpoena it issued to Boies Schiller Flexner LLP and 
to dismiss Counts Five and Six, which are the fruits of that unlawful subpoena. 
Introduction and Summary of the Argument 
If the government meant to reassure this Court that nothing improper happened, its 
Response was anything but reassuring. 
The government now confesses that it had significant and substantial contact with 
attorneys in 2016—while the 
defamation suit against Maxwell was 
on-going—as part of an effort to instigate a criminal prosecution of Maxwell for allegedly 
trafficking 
and others and then lying under oath. Doubling down on an increasingly 
farfetched story, however, the government insists that nothing improper occurred when it 
misrepresented these contacts to the Chief Judge of the Southern District of New York. 
Contrary to the government's portrayal of events, what happened here is that a prosecutor 
from the public corruption unit of the United States Attorney's Office, in an a parte proceeding, 
affirmatively misled Chief Judge McMahon to circumvent a Protective Order entered by one of 
her colleagues. The prosecutor then exploited the material he obtained to indict Maxwell. 
Had the prosecutor not affirmatively misled Judge McMahon, the government would 
never have obtained the 90,000 pages of material it now possesses, material that is central—
indeed, essential—to its case against Maxwell. It would be the height of irony, not to mention 
injustice, to allow the government to convict Maxwell of testifying falsely when the government 
could not have indicted Maxwell but for the false statements it made to a federal judge. 
"In a situation like this, the judiciary ... may exercise its supervisory power to make it 
clear that the misconduct was serious, that the government's unwillingness to own up to it was 
more serious still, and that steps must be taken to avoid a recurrence of this chain of events."

Wang v. Reno, 81 F.3d 808, 821 (9th Cir. 1996). For the reasons given below, the exercise of this 
Court's supervisory authority is called for here. 
I. The Facts 
Pressed into some minimal measure of candor, the government now admits the following 
facts are true: 
• 
On February 29, 2016, AUSA M, 
the Human Trafficking Coordinator and 
Project Safe Childhood Coordinator for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern 
District of New York, Ex. J, p 1, met with Peter Skinner of Boies Schiller, Stan 
Pottinger, and Brad Edwards, who represented 
M, 
Ex. K, p I. 
• 
The meeting concerned 
allegations of sexual abuse and trafficking by 
Jeffrey Epstein and Maxwell. Ex. J, pp 1-3. 
• 
At the meeting, 
attorneys told AUSA 
the following: 
o That Maxwell was Epstein's "head recruiter" of underage victims. Id. at 2. 
o That 
was underage when she was brought to New York "for training 
by Maxwell and Epstein [in] how to service men." Id. at 3. 
o That 
had a pending civil lawsuit against Maxwell for defamation 
alleging that Maxwell had recruited 
to be trafficked and abused by 
Epstein. Id. at 4, 7. 
o That Maxwell was asserting truth as a defense to 
defamation claim. 
Id. at 4, 7. 
o That Maxwell had photos of naked underage girls on her computer. Id. at 6.1
' No such photos were found on or produced from any computers associated with Maxwell. 
EFTA00028935
--- PAGE 8 ---
o That Maxwell and Epstein-friend 
"took sexually explicit 
photos of [M] 
regularly."2 Id. 
o That, as a birthday present, Maxwell gave Epstein a sexually explicit photo of 
taken when 
was sixteen.3 Id. 
o That Epstein hung the photo on one of his walls.4 Id. 
o That 
has a note in Maxwell's handwriting with the name of another 
victim. Id. at 8.5
o That 
was "live in" sex slave from 2000-2002.6 Id. at 3. 
o That there were other victims of Epstein and Maxwell, including 
M, 
id. at 7, who is apparently Accuser-I in this case, and another woman 
whose description matches 
id. at 9, who is apparently 
Accuser-3. 
o That Accuser-I was "highly credible." Id. at 7. 
o That Epstein and Maxwell used "the same MO with" Accuser-3 that they used 
with 
. Id. at 7, 9. 
o And that 
"wants [a] prosecution." Id. at 7. 
Maxwell denies ever taking any photos of M, 
and we have seen no sexually explicit photo 
of 
in any of the civil or criminal document productions. 
Not only did Maxwell not meet 
until 
was seventeen years old, Maxwell never 
provided any such photo to Epstein, nor, to our knowledge, has any such photo ever been produced, in the 
civil or criminal cases. 
Again, we have not seen any such photo produced in any discovery, either in the civil or 
criminal cases. 
We are aware of no note in Maxwell's handwriting being produced in the 
action, or the 
criminal discovery. 
was in fact living with her fiancé at the time and held multiple other jobs, as later 
confirmed through depositions and documents in the 
action. 
EFTA00028936
--- PAGE 9 ---
• 
The attorneys promised to send AUSA 
support their request for a prosecution. Id. at 8. 
• 
Calling the meeting "intriguing," AUSA 
"affidavits and depositions" to 
emailed the Chief of the Criminal 
Division three days later and proposed to "talk over" the facts with him. Ex. M, pp 1-
2. He agreed. Id. at I. 
• 
In the days and weeks after the February 29 meeting, there were several emails 
between 
attorneys and AUSA 
Exs. L & N. 
• 
There was also at least one phone call. Ex. K, at 4. 
• 
attorneys provided AUSA 
with documents as promised. Id. at 2; see 
also Ex. L, p 2. 
Most importantly, the government now admits that AUSA II
I the prosecutor in 
charge of the case who appeared before Chief Judge McMahon on April 9, 2019, knew all of this 
and still denied that Boies Schiller had any role in fomenting the investigation and claimed that 
there had been no contacts between Boies Schiller and his office before November 2018, when 
he claimed the investigation first began. 
None of these statements by AUSA 
to Judge McMahon were true. 
As described above, 
attorneys pressed the U.S. Attorney's Office for the 
Southern District of New York to investigate and prosecute Epstein and Maxwell. Ex. J. 
Then, two months after the meeting with AUSA 
attorneys told Judge 
Sweet—who was presiding over 
defamation against Maxwell—that there was an 
EFTA00028937
--- PAGE 10 ---
"ongoing criminal investigation" into Maxwell, and they withheld from discovery 57 separate 
documents, invoking the "law enforcement privilege." Ex. P.7
In late November 2018 and early December 2018-just two months before AUSA 
filed the ex parte request before Judge McMahon seeking modification of the civil 
Protective Order entered by Judge Sweet—AUSA 
shared with AUSA 
as 
well as one other member of the trial team and the heads of the Public Corruption Unit, 
everything she learned from her contacts with 
attorneys. Ex. N. 
AUSA 
gave AUSA 
and his colleagues: (1) nine pages of detailed, 
hand-written notes from the February 29 meeting; (2) the emails she received from 
attorneys; and (3) all the documents provided to her by 
attorneys. Id. Some of what she 
gave AUSA 
included material Boies Schiller attorneys designated a short time later 
as "confidential" under Judge Sweet's Protective Order, including flight records and Palm Beach 
Police Department Records. 
AUSA 
took an active role in gathering these materials from AUSA 
Copying AUSA 
AUSA 
had emailed AUSA 
on December 5, 2018, 
to obtain all the records of the February 29 meeting with 
attorneys. Id. at 1. In that 
email, AUSA 
also asked AUSA 
whether, after February 29, she met "again 
with [Peter Skinner] or anyone else." Id. 
Two other aspects to the privilege log are notable: (a) In the 
litigation, Boies Schiller 
did not produce its emails with the U.S. Attorney's Office to Maxwell, despite the fact that they were 
directly responsive to a Request for Production of Documents Maxwell served just a couple of weeks 
after those emails were sent; and (b) Peter Skinner, the Boies Schiller attorney at the AUSA 
meeting who also sent emails to AUSA 
after the meeting, Ex. L, is not even listed on the 
privilege log, though the log purports to reflect all email communications about the "ongoing criminal 
investigation" that Boies Schiller had tried to initiate just a couple of weeks earlier. 
EFTA00028938
--- PAGE 11 ---
Barely twelve hours later, when AUSA 
hadn't responded, AUSA 
took it upon himself to follow up, emailing AUSA 
"Just quickly following up on this — 
we're trying to get a complete handle on the landscape — thanks!" Id. 
AUSA 
responded one hour later: "Just went through my files and found a folder 
w/ the notes I took and the documents they brought me." Id. She turned everything over to 
AUSA 
and other prosecutors in the office, including one other prosecutor on this trial 
team. Id. AUSA 
did not answer AUSA 
original question: "[D]id [she] meet 
again with [Peter Skinner] or anyone else" after the February 29, 2016 meeting with 
attorneys. Id. But AUSA 
certainly did not deny a second meeting or a subsequent phone 
call occurred. Id. 
By the end of the day on December 6, 2018, AUSA 
had in his possession 
everything 
and her attorneys provided to AUSA 
as well as AUSA 
extensive hand-written notes. He also had access to AUSA 
herself for any follow up 
questions. By the end of the day, AUSA 
had a "complete handle on the landscape," 
just as he asked for a couple hours earlier. 
When AUSA 
appeared before Judge McMahon barely four months later, 
however, he told her none of this, unequivocally and falsely disavowing any role by Boies 
Schiller in fomenting the investigation and denying any contacts between Boies Schiller and his 
office before November 2018. Even though AUSA 
had a "complete handle on the 
landscape," he painted an entirely different, false picture for Judge McMahon. 
II. The Government's Response to Maxwell's Motion. 
Confronted with evidence of AUSA 
misrepresentations to Judge McMahon, 
the government has filed a Response reluctantly admitting that the U.S. Attorney's Office had 
sustained contact with Boies Schiller in 2016. Even so, the government tries its best to minimize 
EFTA00028939
--- PAGE 12 ---
the significance of those interactions and of AUSA 
misrepresentations to an Article 
III federal judge. This Court should not permit the government to whitewash its conduct. 
The discovery provided to Maxwell in response to her Motion rebuts every defense the 
government now offers of its conduct. And if that weren't enough, the government's defense 
fails on its own terms, because if this Court were to assume its truth (an assumption the 
government has not earned), AUSA 
statements to Judge McMahon would still have 
been demonstratively and materially false. 
A. The Government's Defenses Are Not Credible. 
Discovery provided to Maxwell in response to her Motion rebuts every defense the 
government now offers of its conduct. 
• 
Defense 1: The February 29, 2016 meeting was only about Epstein. 
AUSA 
contemporaneous hand-written notes entirely undermine the 
government's claim that the February 29, 2016 meeting was about Epstein only and had nothing 
to do with Maxwell. Resp. at 89 & n.39. See Ex. J. AUSA 
notes refer to Maxwell as 
Epstein's "head recruiter" of underage girls; they document allegations that Maxwell "regularly" 
took sexually explicit photos of 
and other underage girls, which she kept on her 
computer; they allege that Maxwell gave one such photo to Epstein as a birthday present, which 
he hung on his wall; they claim that Maxwell, along with Epstein, brought 
to New York 
to personally "train[] [her] . . . [in] how to service men;" and they assert that Maxwell used the 
"same MO" to recruit other girls to the sex trafficking scheme. The contents of AUSA 
notes belie any notion that 
attorneys—who at that very moment were suing Maxwell 
EFTA00028940
--- PAGE 13 ---
for defamation for denying she had trafficked and abused 
were focused only on Epstein 
and not on Maxwell. 
Despite AUSA 
contemporaneous notes showing that the meeting very much 
concerned Maxwell, the government now claims that "the pitch was to investigate Epstein, not 
Maxwell," and that the discussion included only "passing references to Maxwell." Resp. at 89 
n.39. The government bases this argument exclusively on a phone call prosecutors conducted 
with AUSA 
on February 11, 2021, five years after the February 29 meeting actually took 
place. Ex. K. This Court should reject the government's revisionist history. 
The best evidence of what happened on February 29, 2016—at least the best evidence the 
government has produced so far—is AUSA 
contemporaneous notes.8 Ex. J.; Abdel! v. 
City of New York, No. 05 CIV. 8453 KMK JCF, 2006 WL 2664313, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 14, 
2006) (denying motion to quash third-party subpoena because "contemporaneous statements of 
witnesses constitute best evidence"). Although the government attached these notes to its 
Response, Resp. Ex. 5, the government does not rely on them as part of its argument, choosing 
instead to rely on AUSA 
2021 recollection of what happened, Resp. at 62-66, 89 & 
n.39, 92 (citing Ex. 4). 
s It appears the government does not actually want to know anything beyond what AUSA 
remembers (or doesn't remember) of 2016. All the government did in response to Maxwell's Motion was 
telephone AUSA 
The government apparently: (1) did not search its system for any and all emails 
from, to, or about David Boies, Sigrid McCawlpa Pottinger, Brad Edwards, or Peter Skinner; and 
(2) did not interview anyone other than AUSA 
such as the other attendees of the meeting 
(Pottinger, Edwards, and Skinner), or any of the other AUSAs whom AUSA 
talked to about her 
contacts with 
attorneys. 
Most conspicuous, of course, is the government's failure to interview AUSA 
or secure 
an affidavit from him. If this Court does not grant Maxwell's Motion on the papers, only an evidentiary 
hearing can address these issues. 
EFTA00028941
--- PAGE 14 ---
But in her 2021 interview, AUSA 
mostly disclaimed a memory of what happened 
in 2016. Ex. K. The phrases "does not recall," "does not remember," or some similar expression 
of lack of memory appear at least thirty-two times in the notes of the government's 2021 call 
with AUSA 
Id. 
Many of AUSA 
disclaimers, however, are simply not credible. For example, 
AUSA 
claimed not to "have an independent memory of the 
v. Maxwell 
[defamation] lawsuit being mentioned" during the meeting, id. at I, even though her notes are 
replete with references to the lawsuit, Ex. J. After reviewing her notes, AUSA 
denied 
that they refreshed her memory. Ex. K, p I. 
AUSA 
similarly denied remembering whether 
attorneys ever provided 
her with documents, id. at 6, despite the email from Peter Skinner just hours after the February 
meeting providing AUSA 
with numerous documents, Ex. L, p 1-2, and despite the 
fact that AUSA 
in 2018 personally delivered those documents to AUSA 
AUSA 
and one member of the prosecution team in this case, Ex. N, p 1 (12/6/2018 
Email to AUSA 
"Just went through my files and found a folder w/ the notes I took 
and the documents they brought me. Want to come by?"). 
When AUSA 
did claim to remember what transpired, her memory was often 
inconsistent with the contemporaneous evidence. Take just one example. "To [her] knowledge," 
AUSA 
said, she did "not receive[] any discovery materials from any civil case." Ex. K, p 
6. That is not correct. The government admits that AUSA 
received from 
attorneys, and turned over to AUSA 
and others in the office, including flight records 
and Palm Beach Police Department Records. Resp. at 66 & n.2. Both of these documents were 
produced in discovery in the civil case. 
EFTA00028942
--- PAGE 15 ---
From any perspective, therefore, AUSA 
2021 version of events is not worthy of 
credence, nor is the government's Response to Maxwell's Motion, which adopts AUSA 
version of events (to the extent she claims to remember them) while ignoring the 
contemporaneous evidence of what actually happened. The record is surpassingly clear: In 
February 2016 and the weeks and months after, 
attorneys "pitched" a prosecution of 
Maxwell and Epstein.' 
• 
Defense 2: The government was not asked to consider a perjury charge 
against Maxwell. 
Noting that the February 29, 2016 meeting occurred before Maxwell's two depositions 
(April and July 2016), the government insists that 
attorneys did not ask (indeed could 
not have asked) the government to consider charging Maxwell with perjury. Resp. at 63. Again, 
the documentary evidence belies this claim. 
First, AUSA 
contemporaneous notes say that a 
wants prosecution." Ex. 
J, p 7. AUSA 
knew what 
attorneys were after, which is why she emailed the 
Chief of the Criminal Division just days after the meeting to discuss the "intriguing" case, Ex. 
M. 
Second, in the 2021 interview with prosecutors, AUSA 
did not deny that 
attorneys asked her to consider a perjury prosecution. Ex. K, p 5. Instead, AUSA 
said that she "does not remember one way or the other if any of the attorneys referenced 
the possibility of perjury." Id. 
There are other indications as well that 
attorneys pressed AUSA 
to investigate 
Maxwell. For example, while AUSA 
notes say 
"is wanting to cooperate," Ex. 
J, p 2, they say nothing of the sort about Maxwell, instead describing her as Epstein's "head recruiter," id. 
See also Ex. O. 
I0 
EFTA00028943
--- PAGE 16 ---
Third, in the same interview, AUSA 
admitted that she contemplated a perjury 
prosecution, and she "recalls thinking that a perjury investigation would have ... challenges." 
Ex. K, p 5. Left unexplained by the government in its Response to Maxwell's Motion is why 
AUSA 
would have contemplated a perjury prosecution if 
attorneys had not 
proposed one. 
There are two possible explanations. Either (1) 
attorneys knew in February 
2016 that they were going to set a perjury trap for Maxwell, and they discussed that plan with 
AUSA 
at the time, or (2) there were additional communications between AUSA 
and 
attorneys (phone calls or even a second meeting) after Maxwell was deposed. 
Either way, the government contemplated a perjury charge against Maxwell in 2016, and the 
Response's insistence otherwise is not credible. 
• 
Defense 3: Maxwell's argument relies on nothing but the Daily News 
article. 
The government says that Maxwell's argument "is premised solely on her use of selective 
snippets from a lone Daily News Article that is premised, in meaningful part, on anonymous 
sources and hearsay." Resp. at 89. This claim is stunningly disingenuous, and it fails on its own 
terms. 
When Maxwell filed her Motion, she did not have access to the government's emails and 
AUSA 
contemporaneous notes, despite their obvious exculpatory value. See Brady v. 
Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87-88 (1963). The government did not disclose these materials until 
Maxwell challenged the government's candor and conduct before Judge McMahon. One 
wonders whether the government would have provided them to Maxwell had she not filed this 
Motion. 
EFTA00028944
--- PAGE 17 ---
The government's claim also fails on its own terms. The article is not meaningfully 
anonymous.10 Among others, the article quotes David Boies, who said: 
We were saying to anyone who would listen: We've got clients who were abused. 
Some of them were underage. We have the evidence. There's a whole record that's 
been developed. We can establish beyond any reasonable doubt there was a massive 
sex trafficking ring going on. 
The article also quotes Brad Edwards, who describes in his self-published memoir the various 
contacts 
attorneys had with the U.S. Attorney's Office in 2016. 
Finally, as detailed above, AUSA 
contemporaneous notes confirm most of the 
article's substance." Ex. J. 
• 
Defense 4: There was only one meeting. 
The government denies there was a second meeting between the U.S. Attorney's Office 
and 
attorneys. Resp. at 92. This denial, though, is based solely on AUSA 
foggy memory and in the absence of any credible investigation. Contrary to the government's 
claim, the evidence strongly suggests there was a second meeting or some further contact 
between them. At the very least, this Court should hold an evidentiary hearing to find the truth. 
Stephen Rex 
Manhattan federal prosecutors declined to pursue Jeffrey Epstein and 
Ghislaine Maxwell case in 2016, New York Daily News (Oct. 13, 2020), 
https://www.nydailynews.cominew-york/ny-jeffrey-epstein-maxwell-case-20201013-
jinzhl7zdrzdgrbbs7yc6bfnszu-stoiy.html.
To the extent the article relies on unnamed sources, there is no indication those sources are 
anonymous in the sense that the author is unaware of their identity. In the 2021 call, the government 
apparently did not ask AUSA 
whether she was one of the unnamed sources. See Ex. K. 
The government also says the article is hearsay. Resp. at 89. This is an odd claim for the 
government to make while asking this Court to credit double hearsay: someone's notes of statements 
made by AUSA 
during a phone call. The government's hearsay argument does nothing but 
support Maxwell's request for an evidentiary hearing. 
EFTA00028945
--- PAGE 18 ---
Two of the sources in the Daily News article insisted there was a second meeting in the 
summer of 2016.12
In addition, as described above, AUSA 
in 2021 said she recalls contemplating a 
perjury prosecution of Maxwell. Ex. K, p 5. But if there were only the one meeting, it makes 
little sense for AUSA 
to have been thinking about a potential perjury prosecution in 
February of 2016, before Maxwell had even been deposed (unless the plan was to set a perjury 
trap for Maxwell). It is more likely that AUSA 
contemplated a perjury prosecution after 
a second meeting with 
attorneys, which took place after at least one of Maxwell's 
depositions. As reported in the Daily News, "David [Boles] was particularly frustrated by the 
failure to pursue a perjury charge.s13 "We have her dead to rights," he said.14
This Court cannot accept without further inquiry the government's assertion that there 
wasn't a second meeting or any further contact between the U.S. Attorney's Office and 
attorneys. At a minimum, an evidentiary hearing is required. 
• 
Defense 5: AUSA 
had no idea what was in Boles Schiller's files. 
The government stands by the claim that AUSA 
had "either little or no 
additional information than [Judge McMahon did] in terms of what materials there are [and] who 
was deposed" and, for all the government knew, the deposition transcripts would show "page 
after page of people taking the Fifth." See Resp. at 70. The government's Response is not 
credible. 
Supra Note 10. 
Supra Note 10. 
SUM/ Note 10. 
EFTA00028946
--- PAGE 19 ---
For one thing, the government admits that 
attorneys turned over several 
documents in 2016, which were in the government's possession when AUSA 
claimed 
to Judge McMahon that he did not know what was in Boies Schiller's file. Moreover, by the time 
AUSA 
told Judge McMahon that, for all he knew, the deposition transcripts would 
show "page after page of people taking the Fifth," it was already a matter of public record that 
Maxwell had been deposed and that she had not invoked the Fifth Amendment. Ex. Q, p 1. 
The government's argument also defies logic. The government was asking Judge 
McMahon to authorize a subpoena of Boies Schiller's entire file. At a minimum, the government 
had to have asked Boies Schiller about the size of the file and issues related to privilege to 
determine if Boies Schiller would contest the subpoena or notify either the civil court or 
Maxwell when the subpoena was issued and responsive documents produced. In fact, the 
government issued two subpoenas to Boies Schiller: the first for material covered by the 
Protective Order, and the second for material outside the Protective Order's reach. Clearly, the 
government knew more about Boies Schiller's file than AUSA 
let on. 
• 
Defense 6: The "subject of your investigation" to whom Judge McMahon 
referred was Jeffrey Epstein. 
According to the government, when Judge McMahon asked AUSA 
"about 
contacts between the United States Attorney's Office and the Boies Schiller firm prior to the 
issuance of the subpoena on the subject of your investigation," Mot. Ex. E, p 2, Judge McMahon 
was referring only to Epstein. Resp. at 71. This is not a plausible reading of the transcript. 
After his first appearance before her, Judge McMahon haled AUSA 
back to 
court for one reason. "I'll be very up-front with you," she said. Mot. Ex. E, p 2. 
EFTA00028947
--- PAGE 20 ---
I want to make sure I'm not in a Chemical Battk[15] kind of situation, so I would 
like to know about contacts between the United States Attorney's Office and the 
Boies Schiller firm prior to the issuance of the subpoena on the subject of your 
investigation. 
Id. (emphasis added). 
"Tellingly,"16 Judge McMahon did not ask AUSA 
about the "target" of his 
investigation; she asked about its "subject." The "subject of [the] investigation" is much broader 
than its "target." 
"A `target' is a person as to whom the prosecutor or the grand jury has substantial 
evidence linking him or her to the commission of a crime and who, in the judgment of the 
prosecutor, is a putative defendant.' "A `subject' of an investigation is a person whose conduct 
is within the scope of the grand jury's investigation." The scope of an investigation, in turn, 
includes not only potential defendants and potential victims, but also the conduct at issue and the 
locations involved. 
Were there any doubt about Judge McMahon's meaning, she put that doubt to rest in her 
written order authorizing the subpoena. Mot. Ex. G, p 21. The "subject of the investigation," she 
explained, was "the matters that were the subject of the 
[defamation] Action." Id. And 
having asked AUSA 
about his office's contacts with Boies Schiller about "the 
Chemical Bank v. Affiliated FM Ins. Co., 154 F.R.D. 91 (S.D.N.Y. 1994). 
"Tellingly," claims the government in the Response, "Maxwell omits [the phrase 'subject of 
your investigation'] of this question from her motion." Resp. at 70 n.34. Not true. On page 13 of 
Maxwell's Motion, in arguing that AUSA 
mislead Judge McMahon, Maxwell fully and 
completely quotes Judge McMahon's question, just as she does above. Mot. at 13 (quoting Ex. E, p 2). 
United States Department of Justice, JUSTICE MANUAL, JM § 9-11.151, Grand Jury, Advice of 
"Rights" of Grand Jury Witnesses (updated Jan. 2020), available at: https://www.justice.govijm/jm-9-

matters that were the subject of the 
[defamation] Action," and having been misled by 
AUSA 
response, Judge McMahon erroneously (though blamelessly) concluded that 
[n]othing in this record suggests to me that 
or Boies Schiller had anything 
to do with the Government's decision to convene a grand jury to look into the 
matters that were the subject of the 
Action. . . There is no evidence of 
"collusion," to invoke a term of the moment, and it is quite clear that Boies Schiller 
did not foment the Government's investigation. 
hi. (emphasis added). 
For her part, AUSA 
shared the very concern Judge McMahon later expressed to 
AUSA 
that Boies Schiller was trying to instigate an investigation of Maxwell to 
leverage its position in the "ME Action." Mot. Ex. K, p 3. In the 2021 call, AUSA 
recalled that the 
pending CVRA civil case and other civil litigation . . . gave [her] some pause 
because she had other occasions where civil litigants have decided to report 
something to the USAO because they think it will help them in their civil case. 
AUSA 
even mentioned this concern to the Chief of the Criminal Division. Id. If AUSA 
and the Chief of the Criminal Division recognized what was going on, AUSA 
can hardly feign ignorance.19
If the government means to suggest that when Judge McMahon asked about any prior 
contacts concerning "the subject of your investigation," she was somehow confining her inquiry 
to the time period surrounding November 2018, see Resp. at 90-91, that too is an implausible 
reading of the transcript. If Judge McMahon meant "subject" to be a term of art ("subject" of the 
investigation as opposed to a "target" of the investigation), then the government should have 
Of course, if AUSA 
honestly did not understand Chief Judge McMahon's uestion, 
once she issued her opinion there could no longer be any doubt. And at that point, AUSA 
would have been duty-bound to correct the misimpression he had created. N.Y. Rules of Professional 
Conduct, Rule. 3.8, cmt. [6A] ("Like other lawyers, prosecutors are subject to Rule 3.3, which requires a 
lawyer to take reasonable remedial measures to correct material evidence that the lawyer has offered 
when the lawyer comes to know of its falsity."). 
EFTA00028949
--- PAGE 22 ---
disclosed the Boies Schiller contacts for the reasons given above. And if Judge McMahon meant 
"subject" to have its everyday meaning, then she was asking about something even broader: 
Whether the U.S. Attorney's Office had contacts with Boies Schiller about the "subject"—i.e., 
the "conduct"—being investigated. 
Nothing about the transcript supports the government's overly narrow, hindsight-based 
interpretation of Judge McMahon's question. 
* * * 
For these reasons, this Court should reject the government's attempt to rewrite the history 
of its investigation and its affirmative misrepresentations to Judge McMahon. 
B. Assuming the Government's Defenses Are Worthy of Belief, the 
Government Still Misled the Court. 
Even if the government's account were worthy of belief (which it is not), that doesn't get 
the government off the hook. 
The government would like this Court to believe that: (1) the February 29 meeting 
concerned a prosecution of Epstein only and not Maxwell; and (2) when Judge McMahon asked 
AUSA 
about his office's prior contacts with Boies Schiller concerning "the subject of 
its investigation," Judge McMahon was referring to Epstein only and not Maxwell. 
Even if those two assertions were true, however, then AUSA 
still misled 
Judge McMahon and misrepresented the origins of the investigation. Under the government's 
version of events, "the pitch was to investigate Epstein, not Maxwell." Resp. at 89 n.39. If that's 
true, AUSA 
unquestionably should have told Judge McMahon about the February 
2016 meeting when she asked him "about contacts between the United States Attorney's Office 
and the Boies Schiller firm prior to the issuance of the subpoena on the subject of your 
investigation"—i.e., Epstein. AUSA 
did not tell Chief Judge McMahon about the 
EFTA00028950
--- PAGE 23 ---
contacts with Boies Schiller on the topic of Epstein any more than he shared the contacts on the 
topic of Maxwell—he simply denied any contacts had occurred, something that is demonstrably 
false. 
Whether Boies Schiller "pitched" a prosecution of Epstein only or of Epstein and 
Maxwell as a duo, AUSA 
misled Judge McMahon by denying there was any "pitch" 
whatsoever. 
III. The Materiality of the Government's False Statements. 
The government halfheartedly suggests that "there is no reason to believe that a 
description of the February 2016 meeting would have been material to Chief Judge McMahon's 
analysis of whether she was facing a `Chemical Bank kind of situation.' Resp. at 91. Hardly. In 
fact, there is every reason to believe Judge McMahon would have refused to authorize the 
subpoena if AUSA 
had not so misled her. 
How do we know? Because Judge McMahon said so—at least twice. 
Judge McMahon first made this clear by haling AUSA 
back in for one and 
only one reason: To ask him about the contacts between Boies Schiller and his office before 
November 2018. So crucial was this question to Judge McMahon's decision that the transcript of 
the AUSA 
second appearance before her is just three pages long. Mot. Ex. E. 
Judge McMahon made her thinking even clearer in her written order authorizing the 
subpoena. Mot. Ex. G. On page 12 of her opinion, when attempting to reconcile Chemical Bank 
with Martindell,2° Judge McMahon found that "nothing in the record suggests that the 
Government's investigation in this case was occasioned by Boies Schiller—a point to which I 
will return later in this opinion." Mot. Ex. G, p 12. 
Martindell v. Intl Tel. & Tel. Corp., 594 F.2d 291 (2d Cir. 1979). 
EFTA00028951
--- PAGE 24 ---
Judge McMahon "returned" to that point when discussing whether Maxwell could have 
reasonably relied on the Protective Order: 
[T]heaihing on which Maxwell or anyone else might reasonably have relied is 
that 
or her lawyers would not do what the defendant in Chemical Bank 
did—that is, forward discovery materials in their possession to prosecutors for the 
purpose of fomenting an investigation. But I am not faced with that situation. 
Nothing in this record suggests to me that 
or Boies Schiller had anything to 
do with the Government's decision to convene a grand jury to look into the matters 
that were the subject of the 
Action. On the contrary—the Government has 
advised the Court that it contacted Boies Schiller as part of its search for parties 
who might have been victims in its investigation; and that Boies Schiller told the 
Government that it could not consensually produce at least some documents in its 
files because of the existence of the Protective Order. There is no evidence of 
"collusion," to invoke a term of the moment, and it is quite clear that Boies Schiller 
did not foment the Government's investigation. Moreover, the Assistant United 
States Attorney has represented to this Court that he has no idea what is in Boies 
Schiller's files, and that for all he knows every witness who was deposed stood on 
his/her Fifth Amendment rights and refused to answer questions. 
Id. at 21. 
Contrary to Judge McMahon's understanding, Boies Schiller contacted the government 
(not the other way around); there was ample evidence of "collusion"; it was "quite clear that 
Boies Schiller did . . . foment the Government's investigation"; and AUSA 
knew 
much more about what was in Boies Schiller's files than he let on. 
The Chemical Bank situation Judge McMahon was worried about— when civil litigant 
attempts to foment a criminal investigation of her opponent—is exactly what occurred. 
Judge McMahon cannot be faulted for not knowing all the facts. AUSA 
on 
the other hand, had a "complete handle on the landscape," and he withheld the truth from Judge 
McMahon. Had AUSA 
not misled her, it is clear Judge McMahon would not have 
authorized the subpoena.' 
It's notable that even without the benefit of truth from AUSA la 
Judge McMahon 
wrongly concluded that Maxwell could not have reasonably relied on the Protective Order. In fact, the

IV. The Remedy for the Government's Misconduct. 
A. Pursuant to its Inherent Power, this Court Should Suppress the Evidence 
Obtained from Boies Schiller and Dismiss Counts Five and Six, which are 
the Fruits of that Evidence. 
This Court has inherent authority to regulate the administration of criminal justice among 
the parties. McNabb v. United States, 318 U.S. 332, 340 (1943). "Judges have an obligation to 
exercise supervision over the administration of criminal justice in federal courts, a responsibility 
that 'implies the duty of establishing and maintaining civilized standards of procedure and 
evidence.'" United States v. Ming He, 94 F.3d 782, 789 (2d Cir. 1996) (quoting McNabb, 318 
U.S. at 340). As the Supreme Court held in United States v. Payner, "Federal courts may use 
their supervisory power in some circumstances to exclude evidence taken from the defendant by 
'willful disobedience of law."' 447 U.S. 727, 735 (1980) (quoting McNabb, 318 U.S. at 345) 
(citing Elkins v. United States, 364 U.S. 206, 223 (1960); Rea v. United States, 350 U.S. 214, 
216-17 (1956); Hampton v. United States, 425 U.S. 484, 495 (1976) (Powell, J., concurring in 
judgment)). A court should invoke its supervisory power of suppression when "there has been a 
fraud upon the court in addition to a violation of the defendant's rights." United States v. 
Cortina, 630 F.2d 1207, 1216 (7th Cir. 1980). 
In United States v. Cortina, a magistrate issued a search warrant based upon an affidavit 
subscribed by FBI Agent Linda Stewart, which itself was based on the reports and investigation 
of FBI Agent William 
Id. at 1208. Unbeknownst to Agent Stewart, Agent 
Second Circuit in 
v. Maxwell held a few months after Judge McMahon's ruling that Maxwell had 
reasonably relied on the Protective Order's guarantee of confidentiality in substantial part, and it therefore 
redacted sua sponte from the summary judgment material those "deposition responses concerning 
intimate matters where the questions were likely only permitted—and the responses only compelled—
because of a strong expectation of continued confidentiality. 929 F.3d 4, 48, n.22 (2d Cir. 2019) (citing 
Fed. R. Civ. P. 5.2). So, too, has Judge Preska redacted substantial material from the documents she has 
released on remand from the Second Circuit, again reflecting that Maxwell reasonably relied on the 
Protective Order. 
EFTA00028953
--- PAGE 26 ---
reports were replete with misrepresentations and outright lies about the conversations he had 
with, and information provided by, a confidential informant. Id. at 1212-13. The Court of 
Appeals affirmed the district court's order suppressing the evidence obtained from the search 
conducted under the warrant. Id. at 1213. "This search," said the Court, "never should have taken 
place." Id. 
The Court offered two bases for its decision. It first invoked the Franks analysis to affirm 
the district court's conclusion that Agent 
intentionally or recklessly misrepresented 
material information in Agent 
affidavit. Id. But the Court went further, concluding that 
suppression was independently required as a matter of inherent authority. Id. at 1214-17. 
Because Agent 
lied in the affidavit (in addition to lying at the Franks hearing), "[t]he call 
for the court's supervisory power under then circumstances is at its strongest and most 
defensible." Id. at 1214. 
The Court recognized that the inherent authority doctrine is not a free pass for courts to 
suppress evidence or "merely [to] disagree with the method[s] of law enforcement." Id. "[T]he 
federal supervisory power does not give `the federal judiciary a `chancellor's foot' veto over law 
enforcement practices of which it (does) not approve.'" Id. (quoting United States v. Russell, 411 
U.S. 423,435 (1973)). Even so, inherent authority is properly invoked to "prevent[] the court 
from condoning a fraud perpetrated upon it." Id. Suppression serves both to deter unlawful 
governmental conduct and to protect judicial integrity. Id. (weighing "the deterrent values of 
preventing the incrimination of those whose rights the police have violated ... and the need to 
protect the integrity of the federal courts against the cost to society of excluding `probative but 
tainted evidence"). 
EFTA00028954
--- PAGE 27 ---
Maxwell had a due process right to notice and an opportunity to be heard on the 
government's request to modify the Protective Order and issue a subpoena to Boies Schiller. 
Mot. Ex. A, 1 14 (permitting modification of the Protective Order only "for good cause shown 
following notice to all parties and an opportunity to be heard"); Mot. Ex. H (Judge Netbum 
denying the government's ex parte request to modify the Jane Doe 43 Protective Order in part 
because the government was attempting to deprive Maxwell of notice and an opportunity to be 
heard); Martindell, 594 F.2d at 294; see U.S. CONST. amend. V. Maxwell also had a privacy 
interest in the materials subject to the subpoena, including most especially her deposition 
transcripts. Mot. Ex. A (defining "confidential" material as that which "implicates common law 
and statutory privacy interests of ... Ghislaine Maxwell"); see U.S. CONST. amend. IV. The 
government violated these rights when it secured an ex pane modification of the Protective 
Order based on materially false statements to Judge McMahon. In resisting any sanction for its 
misconduct, and in denying that Maxwell should even be afforded a hearing, the government 
asks this Court to "condon[e] a fraud perpetrated upon it." See Cortina, 630 F.2d at 1214. 
To be sure, AUSA 
misled Judge McMahon in answering the singular question 
she posed, and he did so with full knowledge of the facts. AUSA 
misrepresentations 
were material to Judge McMahon's decision, because she would not have modified the 
Protective Order if AUSA 
had been candid about Boies Schiller's role in initiating 
the investigation. As Judge McMahon put it, "the only thing on which Maxwell... might 
reasonably have relied is that 
or her lawyers" would not approach prosecutors and 
"foment the Government's investigation." Mot. Ex. G, p 21. I. That is, in fact, exactly what 
happened. As in Cortina, the modification of the Protective Order "never should have taken 
place." Id. When, as here, a prosecutor—from the public corruption unit no less-misrepresents 
EFTA00028955
--- PAGE 28 ---
material information to a federal judge in an ex parte proceeding, "[t]he call for the court's 
supervisory power ... is at its strongest and most defensible." Cortina, 630 F.2d at 1214. 
Maxwell need not satisfy the standard of Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978) in 
order to obtain relief. But even if Franks applies, Maxwell has easily met her burden. To obtain a 
Franks hearing, a defendant must make a "substantial preliminary showing," United States v. 
Falso, 544 F.3d 110, 125 (2d Cir. 2008) (quoting Franks, 438 U.S. at 155-56), that (i) there were 
"inaccuracies or omissions" in the affidavit, (ii) "the alleged falsehoods or omissions were 
necessary to the issuing judge's probable cause or necessity finding," and (iii) "the claimed 
inaccuracies or omissions [were] the result of the affiant's deliberate falsehood or reckless 
disregard for the truth." United States v. Lambus, 897 F.3d 368, 397 (2d Cir. 2018). Here, there 
is no dispute that (i) AUSA 
representations to Judge McMahon were false and 
misleading, (ii) Judge McMahon would not have modified the Protective Order to authorize the 
subpoena if AUSA 
had been honest with her, and (3) AUSA 
statements 
were deliberately false, since he had a "complete handle on the landscape" months before he 
appeared in front of and misled Judge McMahon. 
Nor need Maxwell prove "outrageous government conduct" to obtain relief. Were that 
her burden, however, Maxwell would have easily satisfied it. "The concept of fairness embodied 
in the Fifth Amendment due process guarantee is violated by government action that is 
fundamentally unfair or shocking to our traditional sense of justice." United States v. Schmidt, 
105 F.3d 82, 91 (2d Cir. 1997). To prevail on an outrageous government conduct claim, "a 
defendant must show that the government's conduct is `so outrageous that common notions of 
fairness and decency would be offended were judicial processes invoked to obtain a 
EFTA00028956
--- PAGE 29 ---
conviction.'" United States v. Bout, 731 F.3d 233, 238 (2d Cir. 2013) (quoting United States v. 
Schmidt, 105 F.3d 82, 91 (2d Cir. 1997)). 
Here, it would "shock the conscience" to permit a prosecutor to make false statements to 
a federal judge to circumvent another judge's duly-entered order, all in violation of the 
defendant's due process, privacy, and Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights. The only way to 
prevent Maxwell from suffering unconstitutional prejudice because of the government's 
misconduct is to suppress the evidence the government unlawfully obtained and to dismiss 
Counts 5 and 6. 
* * * 
AUSA 
breached two separate but equally consequential duties: The duty of a 
public prosecutor and the duty of candor. 
"[T]he responsibility of a public prosecutor differs from that of the usual advocate; his 
duty is to seek justice, not merely to convict." Young v. United States, 481 U.S. 787, 803 (1987). 
Prosecutors are held to a higher standard, and for good reason. "[The prosecutor] is in a peculiar 
and very definite sense the servant of the law, the twofold aim of which is that guilt shall not 
escape or innocence suffer." Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 88 (1935). 
Moreover, "[i]n light of the prosecutor's public responsibilities, broad authority and 
discretion, the prosecutor has a heightened duty of candor to the courts and in fulfilling other 
professional obligations." ABA Criminal Justice Standards, Prosecution Function, Standard 3-
1.4 (4th ed. 2017). "While all lawyers owe a duty of honesty and candor to the Court, `this 
obligation lies most heavily upon [public prosecutors] who are not merely partisan advocates, but 
public officials charged with administering justice honestly, fairly and impartially." Morales v. 
Portuondo, 165 F. Supp. 2d 601, 612 (S.D.N.Y. 2001). 
EFTA00028957
--- PAGE 30 ---
In turn, this already high standard ratchets up even higher when a prosecutor appears 
before the court ex parte. "The duty of candor is, if anything, more critical when ex parte 
applications are made to a court." hr re WinNet R CJSC, 2017 WL 1373918, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. No. 
16MC484(DLC), Apr. 13, 2017); see N.Y. Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 3.3(d) ("In an ex 
pane proceeding, a lawyer shall inform the tribunal of all material facts known to the lawyer that 
will enable the tribunal to make an informed decision, whether or not the facts are adverse."); see 
also id. cmt. [14]. And it "is not a defense to claim that, while factual statements to the Court 
were materially misleading, they were not literally false. Attorneys are officers of the Court, and 
our system of justice cannot operate efficiently if the Court cannot rely on the candor of counsel 
presenting an application for ex parte relief." Four Star Fin. Servs., LLC v. Commonwealth 
Mgmt. Assocs., 166 F. Supp. 2d 805, 810 (S.D.N.Y. 2001). 
AUSA 
failed to live up to these standards. In an ex parte proceeding, AUSA 
affirmatively misled Judge McMahon, with full knowledge of what issue concerned 
Judge McMahon and what information would be material to her decision. When, as here, "there 
has been a fraud upon the court," Cortina, 630 F.2d at 1216, "[t]he court has inherent authority 
to regulate the administration of criminal justice among the parties before the bar .... [by] 
exclud[ing] evidence taken from the defendant by willful disobedience of law," id. at 1214. 
United States v. Lambus, 897 F.3d 368, 386 (2d Cir. 2018) ("It is within the court's inherent 
authority to suppress evidence gathered unlawfully in order to maintain the integrity of its own 
proceedings...."). 
EFTA00028958
--- PAGE 31 ---
B. At a Minimum, this Court Should Order a Hearing at which Maxwell 
May Inquire into the Circumstances Surrounding the Government's 
Misrepresentation to Judge McMahon. 
"An evidentiary hearing is normally required to address motions to suppress where a 
factual issue is in dispute." United States v. Paredes-Cordova, No. SI 03 CR. 987DAB, 2009 
WL 1585776, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. June 8, 2009); United States v. Pena, 961 F.2d 333, 339 (2d Cir. 
1992) ("[A]n evidentiary hearing on a motion to suppress ordinarily is required if the moving 
papers are sufficiently definite, specific, detailed, and nonconjectural to enable the court to 
conclude that contested issues of fact going to the validity of the search are in question." 
(quotation omitted))). Here, the government has confessed enough facts to demonstrate that 
Maxwell at least is entitled to a hearing. 
There is no merit to the government's assertion that Maxwell is not entitled to a hearing 
because she has not submitted an affidavit in support of her Motion. An affidavit is not a 
prerequisite to a hearing when the government has confessed the existence of facts sufficient to 
entitle a defendant to an evidentiary hearing. 
Nor is an affidavit required when information at issue is peculiarly within the possession 
of the government (e.g., AUSA 
and AUSA 
or others who are adverse to 
Maxwell (e.g., Boies, Edwards, Skinner, Pottinger). See Cortina, 630 F.2d at 1216 ("The 
violation here is particularly insidious because it is difficult to uncover misrepresentations in an 
[ex parte submission]. The information needed to prove such assertions false is peculiarly within 
the hands of the government."). Since Maxwell was not at the February 29 meeting or copied on 
any of the emails or communications that followed, the Response does not explain how Maxwell 
could possibly submit an affidavit attesting to the government's misrepresentations based on 
personal knowledge. 
EFTA00028959
--- PAGE 32 ---
The government of course does not suggest that any of its agents, such as AUSA 
I
I, would be willing to provide an affidavit to Maxwell or otherwise speak with defense 
counsel absent compulsion from this Court. Indeed, the government conspicuously did not attach 
to its Response any affidavits about its interactions with Boies Schiller. 
It's plain, therefore, that this Court should hold an evidentiary hearing and effectuate 
Maxwell's constitutional right to compulsory process because that is the only way to get to the 
truth.22
Conclusion 
For these reasons, as well as those given in the Motion, this Court should: (1) suppress all 
evidence the government obtained from Boies Schiller and any other evidence derived 
therefrom; or (2) suppress the April and July 2016 depositions and all evidence derived 
therefrom; and (3) dismiss Counts Five and Six. Maxwell requests an evidentiary hearing on this 
Motion. 
Dated: March 15, 2021 
If this Court concludes an affidavit is required before it holds a hearing, Maxwell requests 
leave, as she did in her Motion, to attempt to obtain such an affidavit. But if, as is likely, none of the 
participants—e.g., AUSA 
, AUSA 
Boies, Edwards, Skinner, Pottinger—voluntarily 
provides an affidavit, Maxwell invokes her constitutional right to compulsory process and this Court's 
authority to compel testimony in support of her defense. U.S. CONST. amend. VI.

The significant delay in prosecuting these charges has substantially prejudiced Ms. 
Maxwell, and the government has offered no legitimate reason for the tactical delay. Indeed, 
many of the arguments made by the government in response to Ms. Maxwell's motions reveal 
new information that undercut its claims about the origins of, and motives behind, this 
prosecution. 
Ms. Maxwell raised this issue pretrial, as required by Fed. R. Crim. P 12(b)(3)(A)(ii). In 
her opening memorandum Ms. Maxwell noted that significant discovery related to the 
allegations had not yet been provided by the government, that her investigation is ongoing, and 
requested that the Court defer ruling on this motion. 
The government's responses to Ms. Maxwell's motions, including its response to this 
motion, underscore the legitimacy of Ms. Maxwell's continued request that the Court hold this 
issue open. As reflected in the various pleadings, the government did have communications with 
lawyers for civil litigants and did have information about the allegations made in the indictment 
well before it claims the investigation was opened. Ms. Maxwell learned about these things only 
because the government felt the need to make partial disclosures in an attempt to defend its 
actions. 
In its response to the instant motion, the government, without actually disclosing the 
witness's statements, selectively "proffers" "facts" to justify its position but tells Ms. Maxwell 
and the Court that we should, apparently, just trust the government because "the underlying 
information, which is contained in the FBI 302 reports of interviews with the victims, will be 
produced to the defense as 3500 material in advance of trial." Resp. at 55 fn. 21. 
As discussed in her Motions to Dismiss for Lack of Specificity, for a Bill of Particulars, 
and for Pretrial Disclosures, the government's failure to provide adequate information about the 
EFTA00028964
--- PAGE 3 ---
allegations in the indictment continues to prejudice Ms. Maxwell's ability to investigate and 
defend this matter. It is fundamentally unfair for the government to withhold basic information 
while at the same time making representations about that information to the Court when 
convenient. This type of selective disclosure by one party in litigation is disfavored. See, 
e.g., United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225, (1975); United States v. Bilzerian, 926 F.2d 1285 (2d 
Cir. 1991); In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 219 F.3d 175, 182-84 (2d Cir.2000); Granite 
Partners, L.P. v. Bear, Stearns & Co., Inc., 184 F.R.D. 49, 54 (S.D.N.Y. 1999); Worthington v. 
Endee, 177 F.R.D. 113, 116-17 (N.D.N.Y. 1998); Peck v. United States, 514 F. Supp. 210, 213 
(S.D.N.Y.), on reargument, 522 F. Supp. 245 (S.D.N.Y. 1981); State of N. D. ex reL Olson v. 
Andrus, 581 F.2d 177, 182 (8th Cir. 1978) (selective disclosure exhibited by the government in 
this action is "intolerable as a matter of policy"). 
It would be inefficient and a waste of judicial resources to continue to litigate this issue 
piecemeal. Moreover, until Ms. Maxwell has complete relevant information, she cannot precisely 
identify the many witnesses and documents that are unavailable to her as a result of the pretrial 
delay. 
CONCLUSION 
Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell requests that the Court defer consideration of her Motion to 
Dismiss Counts One Through Six of the Superseding Indictment for Pit-Indictment Delay until 
after the government has produced all of the discovery in this matter, including, but not limited 
to any alleged F.R.E. 404(b) information, all witness statements, and all Brady and Giglio 
material.

The government does not dispute that Counts 1 and 3 charge Ms. Maxwell with the same 
crime, conspiracy in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371, nor that the charges are based on identical 
facts. Effectively conceding that the counts are multiplicitious, the government argues that the 
motion is "premature," focusing only on the jeopardy problem that would occur if Ms. Maxwell 
were convicted on both counts at trial and ignoring the prejudice to Ms. Maxwell attendant to the 
overcharging. The government argues that the Court should defer ruling on this motion until 
"after the completion of trial" which will "ensure" a full factual record. Resp. at 172. The 
government is wrong. 
The Court can, and should, grant this Motion, direct the government to elect which of the 
conspiracy charges it will prosecute, and dismiss the other. The identical facts are plainly alleged 
in the superseding indictment ("Indictment"), and the government has presented no factual 
distinction in its response. Accordingly, no additional record is necessary and very clear 
authority exists supporting the relief requested by Ms. Maxwell, dismissal of one of the 
multiplicitous counts. "District courts presented with what are recognized before or during trial 
to be multiplicitous indictments will avoid any problem by requiring the prosecution to elect 
between counts charged rather than by merging the counts at sentencing." United States v. 
Polizzi, 257 F.R.D. 33, 36-37 (E.D.N.Y. 2009). The Court should order such an election and 
dismissal here. 
I. The Motion is Not Premature, and the Court has Discretion to Direct Election 
and Dismissal Pretrial 
The government's "prematurity" argument is misplaced. Pursuant to Federal Rule of 
Criminal Procedure 12(b)(3)(B)(ii), a defendant is required to raise arguments based 
on defects in the indictment, including "charging the same offense in more than one count 
(multiplicity)," by pretrial motion "if the basis for the motion is then reasonably available and the 
EFTA00028969
--- PAGE 3 ---
motion can be determined without a trial on the merits." See United States v. Dervishaj, 787 F. 
App'x 12, 15 (2d Cir. 2019), cert. denied, 140 S. Ct. 2548 (2020) (multiplicity argument waived 
because the defendant failed to raise the issue by pretrial motion). 
The government also ignores ample Second Circuit authority that authorizes the relief 
requested by Ms. Maxwell: 
The defendant may move to have the prosecution elect among the multiplicitous 
counts, with all but the one elected dismissed. This is a matter for trial court 
discretion, and is most appropriate when the mere making of the charges would 
prejudice the defendant with the jury. 
United States v. Reed, 639 F.2d 896, 905 (2d Cir. 1981).' 
The reason for this discretion is clear: 
The law protects an individual against multiplicitous indictments to avoid multiple 
sentences for a single offense and to eliminate the prejudice which such indictments 
may generate in the eyes of a jury. For when an indictment charges numerous 
offenses arising from the same conduct it may falsely suggest to a jury that a 
defendant has committed not one but several crimes. 
Once such a message is conveyed to the jury, the risk increases that the jury will be 
diverted from a careful analysis of the conduct at issue. Compromise verdicts or 
assumptions that, with so many charges pending the defendant must be guilty on at 
least some of them, pose significant threats to the proper functioning of the jury 
system. 
United States v. Clarridge, 811 F. Supp. 697, 702 (D.D.C. 1992) (cleaned up).2
Ms. Maxwell has been charged with the identical conduct in Counts 1-4. These multiple 
counts falsely suggest to the July that Ms. Maxwell is alleged to have committed more than one 
crime. The defect in the Indictment is patent and prejudicial, and the Court should remove the 
' See also United States v. Ketchum, 320 F.2d 3, 7 (2d Cir.1963); United States v. Carter, 576 
F.2d 1061, 1064 (3d Cir.1978); and United States v. Langford, 946 F.2d 798, 802 (11th Cir.1991). 
See also United States v. Chacko, 169 F.3d 140, 145 (2d Cir.1999) (A multiplicitous indictment 
creates an exaggerated impression of a defendant's criminal activity by charging "an offense multiple 
times, in separate counts, when, in law and fact, only one crime has been committed."). 
EFTA00028970
--- PAGE 4 ---
defect by requiring the government to elect which of the conspiracy charges it will move forward 
with and dismiss the remaining conspiracy charge. 
II. The Government Failed to Meet its Burden of Establishing the Two Alleged 
Conspiracies Are Distinct. 
To guard against the "well recognized danger" that prosecutors can easily "draft 
indictments that allege what appear to be separate conspiracies but may actually be parts of an 
overall conspiracy," where a defendant "makes a non-frivolous showing that two indictments in 
fact charge only one conspiracy, the burden shifts to the prosecution to show, by a 
preponderance of the evidence, that there are in fact two distinct conspiracies." United States v. 
Lopez, 356 F.3d 463, 467 (2d Cir. 2004) (citing United States v. DelVecchio, 800 F.2d 21, 22 (2d 
Cir. 1986)). As demonstrated in Ms. Maxwell's moving papers, application of the Koyfant 
multifactor test results in an identical overlap of alleged: participants, time, similarity of 
operation, overt acts, geography, objectives, and interdependence. Mot. at 2. The government has 
failed to proffer any evidence to the contrary, and Ms. Maxwell's Motion should be deemed 
confessed. 
CONCLUSION 
For the reasons stated in Ms. Maxwell's original Motion and this Reply, she requests that 
the Court enter an order requiring the government to elect the conspiracy charge it intends to 
prosecute and dismiss the remaining count.

The government continues to stonewall Ms. Maxwell's requests for clarity about what it 
claims she did to justify her continued incarceration and prosecution. Although the government 
has dumped thousands of pages of irrelevant discovery from inapplicable time periods on Ms. 
Maxwell and her counsel, it refuses to provide the most basic information about the allegations 
in Counts One through Four: who, what, when, and how. Because Counts One through Four of 
the superseding indictment ("Indictment") lack the basic factual information necessary for Ms. 
Maxwell to prepare her defense, and the government refuses to provide any meaningful 
discovery, the Court should either dismiss these counts or direct the government to answer Ms. 
Maxwell's requests for particularity. 
I. The Indictment Lacks the Necessary Specificity 
The government attempts to justify some of the Indictment's deficiencies, e.g., lack of 
names and dates, through citation to obviously inapplicable cases. 
"First," the government offers United States v. Stringer, 730 F.3d 120, 124 (2d Cir. 
2013), for the proposition that "the use of pseudonyms to refer to minor victims of the charged 
conduct does not warrant dismissal of the indictment." Resp. at 153. The government fails to 
point out, however, that Stringer was a fraud case in which the conduct was alleged to have 
occurred over a 7-month period. The indictment was brought within a few years, not decades, of 
the alleged crime, and the identity of the two people whose names were used in connection with 
the fraud "had been revealed in the documents disclosed by the government a year" before trial. 
Id. at 123. 
United States v. Kidd, 386 F. Supp. 3d 364, 367 (S.D.N.Y. 2019), is equally 
unpersuasive. Kidd was indicted in 2018 for crimes alleged to have occurred as late as 2018. 
The case involved two alleged victims and the government produced sufficient discovery to 
obviate the need for a bill of particulars. Id. at 368, 370. 
EFTA00028975
--- PAGE 3 ---
The Indictment against Ms. Maxwell registers a 98 on the opacity chart. Instead of two 
alleged "victims," the indictment here has different categories with three people being identified 
as "Minor Victims," even though they are not minors. Additionally, an unknown number of 
unexplained categories of unidentified human beings appear in the Indictment: "multiple minor 
girls," "victims," "minor victims," "minor victims described herein," "some of Epstein's minor 
victims," and "multiple minor victims." It is a mystery if the government claims that these 
alleged people are the same, part of the alleged crime, or surplusage. Multiple "among other 
thing" and "means and methods" alleged acts are bandied about in the indictment such as: 
assisted, facilitated, contributed, recruit, groom, befriend, spending time, being present, help, etc. 
This Indictment is subject to considerable interpretation and manipulation. Ms. Maxwell cannot 
prepare a defense without knowing who her accusers are and whether they are limited to the 
alleged "Minor Victims" or the rest of the universe. 
"Second," the government relies on the general proposition that "Courts in the Second 
Circuit have consistently upheld indictments containing a range of time rather than a specific 
date." Resp. at 154. Again, the cited cases are easily distinguishable. Kidd involved a date range 
ending in the year of indictment. Moreover, the quoted general language from Kidd, 386 F. Supp. 
3d 364, 369, is incomplete. The court in Kidd explains the range it is referring to by the 
following reference: "See United States v. Nersesian, 824 F.2d 1294, 1323 (2d Cir. 1987) 
(holding that 'on or about June 1984' put a defendant on notice for potential crimes in July or 
early August of 1984 'because the [G]ovemment is not required to prove the exact date, if a date 
reasonably near is established')." Id. The government fails to include this language because it is 
inapposite to the suggestion that there is anything "routine" about a date range beginning 27 
EFTA00028976
--- PAGE 4 ---
years ago that may be applicable to dozens of people in multiple places including a foreign 
country. 
United States v. Vickers, No. 13-CR-128-A, 2014 WL 1838255, at *1 (W.D.N.Y. May 8, 
2014), also does not help the government. This case concerned a one count indictment in 2013. It 
is patently clear from the opinion by the district court that the statements from the alleged victim 
detailing the allegation had been provided to the defendant and the court which noted that the 
lengthy recitation of facts in the opinion "are taken from the allegations set forth in the Affidavit 
of Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent 
submitted in support of the 
May 16, 2013 Criminal Complaint (Dkt.# 1), the Indictment (Dkt.# 8), and the government's 
response to the instant motions (Dkt.# 20)." 2014 WL 1838255, at *3 n.1. The dates and times 
of the alleged conduct would have been fairly easy to identify given the detail provided in 
discovery. Here, Ms. Maxwell has not been provided with any relevant statements by the 
government or its witnesses. 
The government's attempt to hide behind the general proposition that children cannot be 
expected to remember dates also fails. Resp. at 155. The alleged victims here are not children, 
they are adults. Moreover, a review of the case relied on by the government, United States v. 
Young, No. 08-CR-285 (KMK), 2008 WL 4178190, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 4, 2008), demonstrates 
the proper way to charge these types of allegations (which is not as the government did here): 
Count One alleges that Defendant sexually abused Victim One, aged fourteen at 
the time, during the daytime on a Saturday in or about the Fall of 2006; Count 
Two alleges that Defendant sexually abused Victim One, aged fifteen at the time, 
during the daytime on a Saturday in or about September 2007; and Count Three 
alleges that Defendant sexually abused Victim Two, aged sixteen at the time, on 
an evening in or about the Summer of 2006. Stated differently, the three counts 
each specify a particular time of day (daytime or evening), and feature variances 
in date ranges stretching from roughly four days in Count Two to thirteen days in 
Count One to four months in Count Three. 
EFTA00028977
--- PAGE 5 ---
Thus, the court found: the indictment "contains dates ranges for each count, stretching from 
approximately four days to four months. These date ranges are well within the boundaries 
permitted by the Second Circuit and other federal courts, and have been supplemented with 
additional details provided by the Government Id., at *4 (emphasis added). 
To date, the only time the government has "supplemented" any information about the 
accusations is when it is attempting to excuse some failure. 
Here, the accusers have given statements to the government. Accuser-1 gave a statement 
to the government in 2006. All three accusers have made claims against the Epstein Estate. 
Presumably, the Accusers had to tell the Estate when and where any alleged abuse by Epstein 
occurred. Accordingly, this is not a situation where children do not remember things. This is a 
situation where the government has refused to provide basic necessary information in an attempt 
to prejudice Ms. Maxwell's defense. 
"Third," the indictment is not "clear" (Resp. at 155); it was purposely drafted to 
maximize charges and minimize clarity. For example, the photograph of Ms. Maxwell in the 
indictment is not from the time-period alleged. The pictures of the various properties were not 
included for specificity, they were included to maximize pretrial prejudice. The indictment is 
full of "weasel words" which are words the meaning of which are "malleable to a point where 
they mean what the user wants them to mean in any given situation; they have no meaning of 
their own." Abstrax, Inc. v. Hewlett-Packard Co., No. 2:14-CV-158-JRG, 2014 WL 5677834, at 
*2 (E.D. Tex. Nov. 4, 2014). For example: "up to and including at least in or about," 
"contributed," "among other things," "for example in some instances," "certain victims," and 
"groomed and/or abused at multiple locations including the following." Ms. Maxwell is at a loss 
to understand what she is charged with and when it is alleged to have happened. She can guess at 
EFTA00028978
--- PAGE 6 ---
names, but given the government's recent harbinger of a superseding indictment, likely to 
attempt to fix some of these problems, Ms. Maxwell is wasting time and money playing whack-
a-mole with this Indictment. 
IL This Indictment Does Not Satisfy Minimal Notice Requirements 
In Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87, 117-18 (1974), the United States Supreme 
Court explained the circumstances in which an indictment simply setting forth the offense in the 
words of the statute may not suffice: 
Our prior cases indicate that an indictment is sufficient if it, first, contains the 
elements of the offense charged and fairly informs a defendant of the 
charge against which [s]he must defend, and, second, enables [her] to plead an 
acquittal or conviction in bar of future prosecutions for the same offense. It is 
generally sufficient that an indictment set forth the offense in the words of the 
statute itself, as long as those words of themselves fully, directly, and expressly, 
without any uncertainty or ambiguity, set forth all the elements necessary to 
constitute the offence intended to be punished. Undoubtedly the language of the 
statute may be used in the general description of an offence, but it must be 
accompanied with such a statement of the facts and circumstances as will inform 
the accused of the specific offence, coming under the general description, with 
which [she] is charged. (cleaned up). 
The government has failed to provide an indictment that "directly," "expressly," and "without 
uncertainty or ambiguity" sets forth the allegations against her. The alleged facts are vague and 
illusory and no meaningful discovery has been provided. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell cannot 
adequately defend herself, in violation of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the United States 
Constitution. 
CONCLUSION 
Because Counts One through Four of the Indictment lack the basic factual information 
necessary for Ms. Maxwell to prepare her defense, and the government refuses to provide any 
meaningful discovery, the Court should either dismiss these counts or direct the government to 
answer Ms. Maxwell's requests for particularity.

DEFENDANT JEFFREY EPSTEIN'S MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE 
SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE UNDER SEAL 
Defendant Jeffrey Epstein, by and through undersigned counsel, hereby respectfully moves 
this Honorable Court for leave to file under seal his supplemental financial disclosure. As noted in 
Mr. Epstein's bail submission, on advice of counsel, he has not yet provided a complete financial 
disclosure. Counsel's advice on this point was motivated by a desire to ensure the accuracy and 
completeness of the information provided to the Court. Mr. Epstein seeks leave to file his 
forthcoming supplemental disclosure under seal. As grounds and reasons therefor, Mr. Epstein relies 
on the exceptional amount of publicity that has been generated by this case, much of which relates 
specifically to his finances. Under the Bail Reform Act, fmancial information provided by a 
defendant to a pretrial services officer "shall be used only for the purposes of a bail determination 
and shall otherwise be confidential." 18 U.S.C. § 3153(c)(1). Here, in the event Mr. Epstein is 
required to publicly file his financial statement, the information contained therein will inevitably be 
widely disseminated in the news media, contravening the statutory requirement of confidentiality.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
Defendant. 
x 
SEALED 
INDICTMENT 
x 
Cr. 
CRIM 490 
COUNT ONE 
(Sex Trafficking Conspiracy) 
The Grand Jury charges: 
OVERVIEW 
1. 
As set forth herein, over the course of many 
years, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, sexually exploited and 
abused dozens of minor girls at his homes in Manhattan, New 
York, and Palm Beach, Florida, among other locations. 
2. 
In particular, from at least in or about 2002, up 
to and including at least in or about 2005, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, enticed and recruited, and caused to be enticed and 
recruited, minor girls to visit his mansion in Manhattan, New 
York (the "New York Residence") and his estate in Palm Beach, 
Florida (the "Palm Beach Residence") to engage in sex acts with 
him, after which he would give the victims hundreds of dollars 
in cash. Moreover, and in order to maintain and increase his 
supply of victims, EPSTEIN also paid certain of his victims to 
recruit additional girls to be similarly abused by EPSTEIN. In 
EFTA00028990
--- PAGE 2 ---
this way, EPSTEIN created a vast network of underage victims for 
him to sexually exploit in locations including New York and 
Palm Beach. 
3. 
The victims described herein were as young as 14 
years old at the time they were abused by JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, and were, for various reasons, often particularly 
vulnerable to exploitation. EPSTEIN intentionally sought out 
minors and knew that many of his victims were in fact under the 
age of 18, including because, in some instances, minor victims 
expressly told him their age. 
4. 
In creating and maintaining this network of minor 
victims in multiple states to sexually abuse and exploit, 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, worked and conspired with 
others, including employees and associates who facilitated his 
conduct by, among other things, contacting victims and 
scheduling their sexual encounters with EPSTEIN at the New York 
Residence and at the Palm Beach Residence. 
FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
5. 
During all time periods charged in this 
Indictment, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, was a financier with 
multiple residences in the continental United States, including 
the New York Residence and the Palm Beach Residence. 
6. 
Beginning in at least 2002, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, enticed and recruited, and caused to be enticed and 
EFTA00028991
--- PAGE 3 ---
recruited, dozens of minor girls to engage in sex acts with him, 
after which EPSTEIN paid the victims hundreds of dollars in 
cash, at the New York Residence and the Palm Beach Residence. 
7. 
In both New York and Florida, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
the defendant, perpetuated this abuse in similar ways. Victims 
were initially recruited to provide "massages" to EPSTEIN, which 
would be performed nude or partially nude, would become 
increasingly sexual in nature, and would typically include one 
or more sex acts. EPSTEIN paid his victims hundreds of dollars 
in cash for each encounter. Moreover, EPSTEIN actively 
encouraged certain of his victims to recruit additional girls to 
be similarly sexually abused. EPSTEIN incentivized his victims 
to become recruiters by paying these victim-recruiters hundreds 
of dollars for each girl that they brought to EPSTEIN. In so 
doing, EPSTEIN maintained a steady supply of new victims to 
exploit. 
The New York Residence 
8. 
At all times relevant to this Indictment, JEFFREY 
EPSTEIN, the defendant, possessed and controlled a multi-story 
private residence on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, New York, 
i.e., the New York Residence. Between at least in or about 2002 
and in or about 2005, EPSTEIN abused numerous minor victims at 
the New York Residence by causing these victims to be recruited 
to engage in paid sex acts with him. 
EFTA00028992
--- PAGE 4 ---
9. 
When a victim arrived at the New York Residence, 
she typically would be escorted to a room with a massage table, 
where she would perform a massage on JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant. The victims, who were as young as 14 years of age, 
were told by EPSTEIN or other individuals to partially or fully 
undress before beginning the "massage." During the encounter, 
EPSTEIN would escalate the nature and scope of physical contact 
with his victim to include, among other things, sex acts such as 
groping and direct and indirect contact with the victim's 
genitals. EPSTEIN typically would also masturbate during these 
sexualized encounters, ask victims to touch him while he 
masturbated, and touch victims' genitals with his hands or with 
sex toys. 
10. In connection with each sexual encounter, JEFFREY 
EPSTEIN, the defendant, or one of his employees or associates, 
paid the victim in cash. Victims typically were paid hundreds 
of dollars in cash for each encounter. 
11. JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, knew that many of 
his New York victims were underage, including because certain 
victims told him their age. Further, once these minor victims 
were recruited, many were abused by EPSTEIN on multiple 
subsequent occasions at the New York Residence. EPSTEIN 
sometimes personally contacted victims to schedule appointments 
at the New York Residence. In other instances, EPSTEIN directed 
EFTA00028993
--- PAGE 5 ---
employees and associates, including a New York-based employee 
("Employee-1"), to communicate with victims via phone to arrange 
for these victims to return to the New York Residence for 
additional sexual encounters with EPSTEIN. 
12. Additionally, and to further facilitate his 
ability to abuse minor girls in New York, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, asked and enticed certain of his victims to recruit 
additional girls to perform "massages" and similarly engage in 
sex acts with EPSTEIN. When a victim would recruit another girl 
for EPSTEIN, he paid both the victim-recruiter and the new 
victim hundreds of dollars in cash. Through these victim-
recruiters, EPSTEIN gained access to and was able to abuse 
dozens of additional minor girls. 
13. In particular, certain recruiters brought dozens 
of additional minor girls to the New York Residence to give 
massages to and engage in sex acts with JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant. EPSTEIN encouraged victims to recruit additional 
girls by offering to pay these victim-recruiters for every 
additional girl they brought to EPSTEIN. When a victim-
recruiter accompanied a new minor victim to the New York 
Residence, both the victim-recruiter and the new minor victim 
were paid hundreds of dollars by EPSTEIN for each encounter. In 
addition, certain victim-recruiters routinely scheduled these 
EFTA00028994
--- PAGE 6 ---
encounters through Employee-1, who sometimes asked the 
recruiters to bring a specific minor girl for EPSTEIN. 
The Palm Beach Residence 
14. In addition to recruiting and abusing minor girls 
in New York, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, created a similar 
network of minor girls to victimize in Palm Beach, Florida, 
where EPSTEIN owned, possessed and controlled another large 
residence, i.e., the Palm Beach Residence. EPSTEIN frequently 
traveled from New York to Palm Beach by private jet, before 
which an employee or associate would ensure that minor victims 
were available for encounters upon his arrival in Florida. 
15. At the Palm Beach Residence, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, engaged in a similar course of abusive conduct. 
When a victim initially arrived at the Palm Beach Residence, she 
would be escorted to a room, sometimes by an employee of 
EPSTEIN's, including, at times, two assistants ("Employee-2" and 
"Employee-3") who, as described herein, were also responsible 
for scheduling sexual encounters with minor victims. Once 
inside, the victim would provide a nude or semi-nude massage for 
EPSTEIN, who would himself typically be naked. During these 
encounters, EPSTEIN would escalate the nature and scope of the 
physical contact to include sex acts such as groping and direct 
and indirect contact with the victim's genitals. EPSTEIN would 
also typically masturbate during these encounters, ask victims 
EFTA00028995
--- PAGE 7 ---
to touch him while he masturbated, and touch victims' genitals 
with his hands or with sex toys. 
16. In connection with each sexual encounter, JEFFREY 
EPSTEIN, the defendant, or one of his employees or associates, 
• 
paid the victim in cash. Victims typically were paid hundreds 
of dollars for each encounter. 
17. JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, knew that certain 
of his victims were underage, including because certain victims 
told him their age. In addition, as with New York-based 
victims, many Florida victims, once recruited, were abused by 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, on multiple additional 
occasions. 
18. JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, who during the 
relevant time period was frequently in New York, would arrange 
for Employee-2 or other employees to contact victims by phone in 
advance of EPSTEIN's travel to Florida to ensure appointments 
were scheduled for when he arrived. In particular, in certain 
instances, Employee-2 placed phone calls to minor victims in 
Florida to schedule encounters at the Palm Beach Residence. At 
the time of certain of those phone calls, EPSTEIN and Employee-2 
were in New York, New York. Additionally, certain of the 
individuals victimized at the Palm Beach Residence were 
contacted by phone by Employee-3 to schedule these encounters. 
EFTA00028996
--- PAGE 8 ---
19. Moreover, as in New York, to ensure a steady 
stream of minor victims, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, asked 
and enticed certain victims in Florida to recruit other girls to 
engage in sex acts. EPSTEIN paid hundreds of dollars to victim-
recruiters for each additional girl they brought to the Palm 
Beach Residence. 
STATUTORY ALLEGATIONS 
20. From at least in or about 2002, up to and 
including in or about 2005, in the Southern District of New York

New York, New York 10007 
Re: 
United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 (RMB) 
Dear Judge Pitman: 
The Government respectfully submits this letter in advance of the bail hearing scheduled 
for July 8, 2019, in the above-captioned case. For the reasons set forth herein, the Court should 
order that the defendant be detained pending trial; he cannot meet his burden of overcoming the 
presumption that there is no combination of conditions that would reasonably assure his continued 
appearance in this case or protect the safety of the community were he to be released. 
As set forth below, the charges in this case are exceptionally serious: the defendant is 
alleged to be a serial sexual predator who preyed on dozens of minor girls over a period of years, 
and he now faces a potentially massive prison sentence predicated on substantial and multifaceted 
evidence of his guilt. In light of the strength of the Government's evidence and the substantial 
incarceratory term the defendant would face upon conviction, there is an extraordinary risk of 
flight, particularly given the defendant's exorbitant wealth, his ownership of and access to private 
planes capable of international travel, and his significant international ties. Indeed, the arrest of 
the defendant occurred when he arrived in the United States on his private jet after having returned 
from a multi-week stay abroad. 
Finally, and as detailed herein, the Government has real concerns—grounded in past 
experience with this defendant—that if allowed to remain out on bail, the defendant could attempt 
to pressure and intimidate witnesses and potential witnesses in this case, including victims and 
their families, and otherwise attempt to obstruct justice. As a result, he poses both an acute danger 
to the community, including some of its most vulnerable members, and a significant risk of flight. 
The defendant thus cannot overcome the statutory presumption that detention is appropriate in this 
case, and the Court should order that he be detained pending trial.

BACKGROUND 
A. Overview 
On July 2, 2019, a federal grand jury in the Southern District of New York returned a sealed 
indictment (the "Indictment") charging the defendant with one count of sex trafficking of minors, 
in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591, and one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors, 
in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371. 
As charged by the grand jury, the facts underlying the charges in the Indictment arise from 
a years-long scheme to sexually abuse underage girls. In particular, beginning in at least 2002, the 
defendant enticed and recruited dozens of minor girls to engage in sex acts with him, for which he 
paid the victims hundreds of dollars in cash. 
He undertook this activity in at least two different locations, including his mansion in 
Manhattan, New York (the "New York Residence") and his estate in Palm Beach, Florida (the 
"Palm Beach Residence"). In both New York and Florida, the defendant perpetuated this abuse in 
similar ways. Victims were initially recruited to provide "massages" to the defendant, which 
would be performed nude or partially nude, would become increasingly sexual in nature, and 
would typically include one or more sex acts, including groping and direct or indirect contact with 
victims' genitals. The defendant paid his victims hundreds of dollars in cash for each separate 
encounter. 
Moreover, the defendant actively encouraged certain of his victims to recruit additional 
girls to be similarly sexually abused. He incentivized his victims to become recruiters by paying 
these victim-recruiters hundreds of dollars for each additional girl they brought to him. In this 
fashion, the defendant created a vast network of underage victims for him to exploit, in locations 
including New York and Palm Beach. 
The defendant's victims were as young as 14 years old when he abused them. Many of his 
victims were, for various reasons, often particularly vulnerable to exploitation. The defendant 
intentionally sought out—and knew that he was abusing—minors. Indeed, in some instances, his 
victims expressly told him they were underage before or during the period in which he abused 
them. 
In creating and maintaining a network of minor victims whom he abused, the defendant 
worked with others, including employees and associates who facilitated his exploitation of minors 
by, among other things, contacting victims and scheduling their sexual encounters with the 
defendant, both in New York and in Florida. 
B. The Defendant 
Jeffrey Epstein designed, financed, and perpetrated this scheme, both as its main participant 
and through his direction of others, including certain of his employees, to further facilitate his 
rampant abuse of underage girls.

Page 3 
As has been widely reported, the defendant is extraordinarily wealthy, and he owns and 
maintains luxury properties and residences around the world, including in Manhattan, New York; 
Palm Beach, Florida; Stanley, New Mexico; and Paris, France. Additionally, Epstein owns a 
private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands which, as noted above, is believed to be his primary 
residence in the United States. His mansion in Manhattan alone—a multi-story townhouse 
reported to be one of the largest single residences in all of Manhattan, which previously housed a 
school and which he owns through an LLC—has been valued at approximately $77 million. 
Entities controlled by the defendant also own at least two private jets in active service, at least one 
of which is capable of intercontinental travel. 
As described further below, the defendant possesses three active United States passports, 
and his international connections and travels are extensive. 
For example, in addition to 
maintaining a residence in Paris, France, as described above, in the past 18 months alone, the 
defendant has traveled abroad, via private jet, either into or out of the country on approximately 
more than 20 occasions. 
C. The Prior Florida Investigation 
In or about 2005, the defendant was investigated by local police in Palm Beach, Florida, in 
connection with allegations that he had committed similar sex offenses against minor girls. The 
investigation ultimately also involved federal authorities, namely the U.S. Attorney's Office for 
the Southern District of Florida ("SDFL") and the FBI's Miami Office, and included interviews 
with victims based in the Palm Beach area, including some of the alleged victims relevant to Count 
One of the instant Indictment.' 
In fall 2007, the defendant entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the SDFL in 
connection with the conduct at issue in that investigation, which the non-prosecution agreement 
identified as including investigations into the defendant's abuse of minor girls in the Palm Beach 
area. The Southern District of New York was not a signatory to that agreement, and the defendant 
was never charged federally.' In June 2008, the defendant pled guilty in state court to one count 
of procuring a person under the age of 18 for prostitution, a felony, and one count of solicitation 
of prostitution, a felony. As a result, the defendant was designated as a sex offender with 
registration requirements under the national Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act. 
The non-prosecution agreement, further discussed below, was entered into at the conclusion of 
the SDFL investigation and did not purport to cover any victims outside of the State of Florida. 
As noted above, the instant Indictment expressly alleges the existence of dozens of victims who 
were abused in this District in addition to dozens of victims who were abused in Florida. 
While beyond the scope of a bail hearing, as discussed further below, it is well-established in the 
Second Circuit that absent an express provision to the contrary in the agreement, one District is 
not bound by the terms of an agreement entered into between a defendant and a U.S. Attorney's 
Office in another district. See page 6, infra.

ARGUMENT 
I. 
Applicable Law 
Under the Bail Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. §§ 3141 et seq., federal courts are empowered to 
order a defendant's detention pending trial upon a determination that the defendant is either a 
danger to the community or a risk of flight. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e) ("no condition or combination of 
conditions would reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any 
other person and the community"). 
A finding of risk of flight must be supported by a 
preponderance of the evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 5 (2d Cir. 1987); 
United States v. Chirnurenga, 760 F.2d 400, 405 (2d Cir. 1985). A finding of dangerousness must 
be supported by clear and convincing evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Ferranti, 66 F.3d 540, 
542 (2d Cir. 1995); Chirnurenga, 760 F.2d at 405. In addition, a court may also order detention if 
there is "a serious risk that the [defendant] will . . . attempt to obstruct justice, or . . . to threaten, 
injure, or intimidate, a prospective witness or juror." 18 U.S.C. § 3142(0(2)(B); see also United 
States v. Friedman, 837 F.2d 48 (2d Cir. 1988). 
The Bail Reform Act lists four factors to be considered in the detention analysis: (1) the 
nature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person; 
(3) the history and characteristics of the defendant, including the person's "character . . . [and] 
financial resources"; and (4) the seriousness of the danger posed by the defendant's release. See 
U.S.C. § 3142(g). Evidentiary rules do not apply at detention hearings and the government is 
entitled to present evidence by way of proffer, among other means. See 18 U.S.C. § 3142(0(2); 
see also United States v. LaFontaine, 210 F.3d 125, 130-31 (2d Cir. 2000) (government entitled 
to proceed by proffer in detention hearings); Ferranti, 66 F.3d at 542 (same); United States v. 
Martir, 782 F.2d 1141, 1145 (2d Cir. 1986) (same). 
Where a judicial officer concludes after a hearing that "no condition or combination of 
conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any 
other person and the community, such judicial officer shall order the detention of the person before 
trial." 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(1). Additionally, where, as here, a defendant is charged with 
committing an offense involving a minor victim under 18 U.S.C. § 1591, it shall be presumed, 
subject to rebuttal, that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the 
appearance of the defendant as required and the safety of the community. 
U.S.C. 
§ 3142(e)(3)(E). 
Il. 
Discussion 
The defendant should be detained pending trial. For the reasons set forth below, it is 
difficult to overstate the risk of flight and danger to the community if the defendant is released, 
and for those reasons, the defendant cannot overcome the statutory presumption in favor of 
detention in this case.

A. The Defendant Poses an Extreme Flight Risk 
Each of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk — the nature and circumstances 
of the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant —
counsel strongly in favor of detention. 
I. The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense and the Strength of the Evidence 
The "nature and circumstances" of this offense plainly favor detention. 18 U.S.C. 
§ 3I42(g)( I ) (specifically enumerating "whether the offense. . . involves a minor victim" as a 
factor in bail applications). Indeed, the crime of sex trafficking of a minor is so serious that for a 
defendant charged with that offense, there is a presumption that no condition or combination of 
conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as required and the safety of the 
community. 18 U.S.C. § 3142 (e)(3)(E). Here, as specified in the Indictment, the defendant's 
conduct was committed serially, over a period of years, and affected dozens of victims. 
The seriousness of the charge is also reflected in the penalties the defendant faces, which 
include up to 45 years of incarceration for Counts One and Two of the Indictment.' As the Second 
Circuit has noted, the possibility of a severe sentence is a significant factor in assessing the risk of 
flight. See Jackson, 823 F.2d at 7; see also United States v. Cisneros, 328 F.3d 610, 618 (10th Cir. 
2003) (defendant was a flight risk because her knowledge of the seriousness of the charges against her 
gave her a strong incentive to abscond); United States v. Townsend, 897 F.2d 989, 995 (9th Cir. 1990) 
("Facing the much graver penalties possible under the present indictment, the defendants have an even 
greater incentive to consider flight."). Here, the defendant is facing a statutory maximum of decades 
in prison. Even in the absence of means—which, as discussed in detail below, the defendant has 
in abundance—this fact alone would provide a compelling incentive for anyone to fail to appear. 
It is particularly compelling for a defendant who is 66 years old and therefore faces the very real 
prospect of spending the rest of his life in prison if convicted. 
The likelihood of a substantial period of incarceration is buttressed by the strength of the 
evidence. As set forth in the Indictment, the evidence in this case is strong. The Indictment alleges 
that the defendant sexually abused dozens of minor victims, and the conspiracy count lists 
numerous overt acts committed in furtherance of the defendant's crimes.' 
The current penalties for violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1591 include a 10 year mandatory minimum 
sentence. However, that punishment was created through an amendment to the statute in 2006. 
The penalty for a violation of Section 1591 during the period charged in the Indictment, and 
therefore relevant here, was a maximum of 40 years' imprisonment. 
With respect to the evidence in this case, the Court should start its analysis by accepting that the 
Indictment is sufficient, on its own, to establish probable cause that the defendant committed the 
crimes of sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy. Contreras, 776 F.2d at 54. ("Were an 
evidentiary hearing addressing the existence of probable cause required in every § 3142(e) case in

Multiple victims, including several specified in the Indictment, have provided information 
against the defendant. That information is detailed, credible, and corroborated, in many instances, 
by other witnesses and contemporaneous documents, records and other evidence—including, as 
further detailed below, evidence from a search of the New York Residence on the night of the 
defendant's arrest that reflects an extraordinary volume of photographs of nude and partially-nude 
young women or girls. Such corroborating evidence also includes documents and other materials, 
such as contemporaneous notes, messages recovered from the defendant's residence that include 
names and contact information for certain victims, and call records that confirm the defendant and 
his agents were repeatedly in contact with various victims during the charged period. Put simply, 
all of this evidence — the voluminous and credible testimony of individuals who were sexually 
abused by the defendant as minors, each of whom are backed up by other evidence — will be 
devastating evidence of guilt at any trial in this case and weighs heavily in favor of detention. 
Finally, it bears noting that neither the age of the conduct nor the defendant's previous non-
prosecution agreement ("NPA") with a different federal district pose any impediment to his 
conviction. As an initial matter, all of the conduct is timely charged, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3283, 
which was amended in 2003 to extend the limitations period for conduct that was timely as of the 
date of the amendment, to any time during the lifetime of the minor victim. See United States v. 
Chief 438 F.3d 920, 922-25 (9th Cir. 2006) (finding that because Congress extended the statute 
of limitations for sex offenses involving minors during the time the previous statute was still 
running, the extension was permissible); United States v. Pierre-Louis, No. 16 Cr. 541 (CM), 2018 
WL 4043140, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2018) (same). 
Moreover, with respect to the NPA, that agreement, to which the Southern District of New 
York was not a party, which by its express language pertained exclusively to the SDFL 
investigation, and which did not purport to bind any other Office or District, does not preclude 
prosecution in this District for at least two reasons. First, it is well settled in the Second Circuit 
that "a plea agreement in one U.S. Attorney's office does not, unless otherwise stated, bind 
another." United States v. Frisco, 391 F. App'x 920, 921 (2d Cir. 2010) ("A plea agreement binds 
only the office of the United States Attorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it 
affirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.") (citing United States 
v. Annabi, 771 F.2d 670, 672 (2d Cir. 1985) (per curiam)). This is true even if the text of the 
agreement purports to bind "the Government." See Annabi, 771 F.2d at 672. This analysis 
similarly extends to a non-prosecution agreement. See United States v. Laskow, 688 F. Supp. 851, 
854 (E.D.N.Y. 1988) ("Defendant's argument, in effect, is that unless there is an explicit statement 
to the contrary, it is presumed that a non-prosecution agreement binds offices of the United States 
Attorney that are not parties to the agreement. This position is at odds with the law in this Circuit, 
which presumes a narrow reading of the boundaries of a plea agreement unless a defendant can 
affirmatively establish that a more expansive interpretation was contemplated.") (citing Annabi, 
771 F.2d at 672). Second, the Indictment charges conduct not covered by the NPA, namely 
the presumptions and the § 3142(g) factors in deciding whether the defendant should be 
detained."). 
EFTA00029009

conduct that occurred in New York. The prior NPA included a list of several dozen victims 
identified in the prior investigation, all of whom were abused in the State of Florida, and none of 
whom are a part of the conduct charged in Count Two of the instant Indictment. 
Each of these factors—the seriousness of the allegations, the strength of the evidence, and 
the possibility of lengthy incarceration—creates an extraordinary incentive to flee. And as further 
described below, the defendant has the means and money to do so. 
2. The Characteristics of the Defendant 
The history and characteristics of the defendant also strongly support detention. The 
defendant is extraordinarily wealthy and has access to vast financial resources to fund any attempt 
to flee. Indeed, his potential avenues of flight from justice are practically limitless. 
As the defendant acknowledged in his most recent New York State sex offender 
registration, he has six residences, including two in the U.S. Virgin Islands (including his own 
private island), and one each in Palm Beach, Florida; Paris, France; New York, New York; and 
Stanley, New Mexico. The most recent estimated value of the defendant's New York City mansion 
alone is more than $77 million. The most recent tax-assessed value of the defendant's Palm Beach 
estate is more than $12 million. The defendant's primary residence is a private island in the U.S. 
Virgin Islands, a place where any sort of meaningful supervision would be all but impossible. 
Moreover, the defendant has access to innumerable means to flee. His sex registration 
documentation of "current vehicles" lists no fewer than 15 motor vehicles, including seven 
Chevrolet Suburbans, a cargo van, a Range Rover, a Mercedez-Benz sedan, a Cadillac Escalade, 
and a Hummer II. These cars are registered in various states and territories including the Virgin 
Islands, New York, Florida, and New Mexico. The defendant also has access to two private jets, 
giving him the ability to leave the country secretly and on a moment's notice and to go virtually 
anywhere he wants to travel. He is a very frequent international traveler and regularly travels to 
and from the United States by private plane. In particular, between January 1, 2018, and the 
present, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol has logged approximately more than 20 flights in which 
Epstein was traveling to or from a foreign country. Indeed, he was arrested at Teterboro Airport 
arriving on just such a private international flight after having spent approximately three weeks 
abroad. Extensive international travel of this nature further demonstrates a significant risk of 
flight. See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp. 2d 32, 36 (D.D.C. 2005). There can be 
no assurance that, upon release, the defendant would suddenly lack access to such means of travel. 
Finally, the defendant has no meaningful ties that would keep him in this country. The 
defendant has no known immediate family. He is not married and has no children. He has friends 
and associates worldwide, as demonstrated by his extensive international travel, and his 
professional obligations, if any, can and seemingly are plainly capable of being handled by the 
defendant remotely. Simply put, there would be no meaningful reason for the defendant to remain 
in the country, while he would have every incentive (and every resource needed) to flee. 
Nor would home confinement with electronic monitoring reasonably assure the 
defendant's presence as required. At best, home confinement with electronic monitoring would 
EFTA00029010
--- PAGE 8 ---
Honorable Henry Pitman 
United States Magistrate Judge 
July 8, 2019 
Page 8 
merely reduce his head start should he decide to flee. See United States v. Zarger, No. 00 Cr. 773, 
2000 WL 1134364, at *1 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2000) (Gleeson, J.) (rejecting defendant's application 
for bail in part because home detention with electronic monitoring "at best . . limits a fleeing 
defendant's head start"); see also United States v. Casteneda, No. 18 Cr. 047, 2018 WL 888744, 
at *9 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 2018) (same); United States v. Anderson, 384 F.Supp.2d 32, 41 (D.D.C. 
2005) (same); United States v. Benatar, No. 02 Cr. 099, 2002 WL 31410262, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. 
Oct. 10, 2002) (same). 
Finally, there can be little doubt that the defendant is in a position to abandon millions of 
dollars in cash and property securing any potential bond and still live comfortably for the rest of 
his life. These resources, and the ease with which the defendant could flee and live outside the 
reach of law enforcement—particularly considering his vast wealth and lack of meaningful ties to 
this District—make the risk of flight exceptionally high in this case, particularly when considered 
in conjunction with the strength of the government's case and the lengthy sentence the defendant 
could receive if convicted. 
B. The Defendant Poses a Risk of Danger to the Community and of Engaging in 
Obstruction of Justice 
The release of the defendant, under any conditions, would pose a significant threat to the 
community and to the ongoing investigation. 
As described above, where there is probable cause to believe that an individual has 
committed an offense under 18 U.S.C. § 1591, it is presumed that no condition or combination of 
conditions can reasonably assure the safety of the community. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(3). Here, not 
only is the defendant charged with very serious sex crimes against minors, he has already 
previously admitted to—and been convicted of—engaging in related conduct. Specifically, in 
June 2008, the defendant pled guilty in state court to one count of procuring a person under the 
age of 18 for prostitution, a felony, and he currently is a registered sex offender, under 
classification level three in New York—defined as presenting a "high" risk of committing another 
sex crime and harm to the community. While the conduct presently alleged does not post-date the 
2008 conviction, it nevertheless underscores the risk he poses to the community if released. 
Additionally, and in connection with the investigation of the defendant's offense in Florida, 
there were credible allegations that the defendant engaged in witness tampering, harassment, or 
other obstructive behaviors. In fact, according to publicly-filed court documents, there were 
discussions between prosecutors and the defendant's then-counsel about the possibility of the 
defendant pleading guilty to counts relating to "obstruction," as well as "harassment," with 
reference to 18 U.S.C. § 1512, which criminalizes "[t]ampering with a witness, victim, or 
informant." For example, in a communication from the defendant's then-counsel to prosecutors 
in SDFL, his counsel set forth a possible factual proffer that included statements that the defendant 
had "attempted to harass both [redacted] delay and hinder their receipt of a [redacted] to attend an 
official proceeding" and that the defendant "in particular, changed travel plans and flew with both 
[redacted] to the United States Virgin Islands rather than to an airport in New Jersey in order to 
attempt to delay their receipt of what Mr. Epstein expected to be a [redacted]" and "further verbally 
EFTA00029011
--- PAGE 9 ---
Honorable Henry Pitman 
United States Magistrate Judge 
July 8, 2019 
Page 9 
harassed both [redacted] in connection to this attempt to delay their voluntary receipt of process 
all in violation of 18 USC 1512(d)(1)."5 Doe v. United States, 08 Civ. 80736 (S.D. Fla.), Dkts. 
361 at 3-4, 361-7 through 361-11. In addition to 18 U.S.C. § 1512(d), prosecutors also proposed 
that the defendant could plead guilty to 18 U.S.C. § 403, that is, a knowing or intentional violation 
of the privacy protection of child victims and child witnesses, to which the defendant's then-
counsel replied: "Already thinking about the same statutes." Id. Dkt. 361-11. They also discussed 
a possible obstruction plea that "could rely on the incident where Mr. Epstein's private 
investigators followed [redacted] father, forcing off the road." Id. Dkt. 361-10. 
The defendant's apparent previous willingness to obstruct a federal investigation, harass or 
tamper with witnesses, and hire private investigators that "forc[edf off the road" the father of an 
individual relevant in the investigation is alarming. It should especially weigh on the Court's 
consideration here because the defendant was apparently willing to take those steps before even 
being charged and thus facing federal indictment; the incentive to interfere in the Government's 
case here, where an Indictment has been returned, is exponentially greater. And as discussed 
above, the defendant has nearly limitless means to do so. 
Finally, despite having been previously convicted of a sex offense involving an underage 
victim, the defendant has continued to maintain a vast trove of lewd photographs of young-looking 
women or girls in his Manhattan mansion. In a search of the New York Residence on the night of 
his arrest, on July 6-7, 2019, pursuant to judicially-authorized warrants, law enforcement officers 
discovered not only specific evidence consistent with victim recollections of the inside of the 
mansion, further strengthening the evidence of the conduct charged in the Indictment, but also at 
least hundreds—and perhaps thousands-of sexually suggestive photographs of fully- or partially-
nude females. While these items were only seized this weekend and are still being reviewed, some 
of the nude or partially-nude photographs appear to be of underage girls, including at least one girl 
who, according to her counsel, was underage at the time the relevant photographs were taken. 
Additionally, some of the photographs referenced herein were discovered in a locked safe, in which 
law enforcement officers also found compact discs with hand-written labels including the 
following: "Young [Name] + [Name]," "Misc nudes 1," and "Girl pics nude." The defendant, a 
registered sex offender, is not reformed, he is not chastened, he is not repentant,' rather, he is a 
continuing danger to the community and an individual who faces devastating evidence supporting 
deeply serious charges. 
The redactions above are contained in the publicly filed version of the quoted document. 
See, e.g., Amber Southerland, Billionaire Jef•ey Epstein: I'm a sex offender, not a predator, 
N.Y. Post (2011) ("I'm not a sexual predator, I'm an "offender," the financier told The Post 
yesterday. `It's the difference between a murderer and a person who steals a bagel.'"); Philip 
Weiss, The Fantasist, New York Magazine (2007) ("`It's the Icarus story, someone who flies too 
close to the sun,' I said. 'Did Icarus like massages?' Epstein asked.").

Honorable Henry Pitman 
United States Magistrate Judge

CONCLUSION 
As set forth above, in this case, the risk of flight in this case is extraordinarily real. The 
defendant is extremely wealthy, has extensive foreign contacts, and is charged with serious 
offenses that carry a potential statutory sentence of up to 45 years' imprisonment—even a fraction 
of which could result in the defendant, who is 66 years old, spending the rest of his life in jail. In 
sum, the defendant's transient lifestyle, his lack of family or community ties, his extensive 
international travel and ties outside the country, and his vast wealth, including his access to and 
ownership of private planes, all provide the defendant with the motive and means to become a 
successful fugitive. Further, the nature of the offenses he is alleged to have perpetrated—the abuse 
dozens of underage, vulnerable girls—along with his demonstrated willingness to harass, 
intimidate and otherwise tamper with victims and other potential witnesses against him, render his 
dangerousness readily apparent. 
Accordingly, the Government respectfully submits that the defendant cannot and will not 
be able to meet his burden of overcoming the strong presumption in favor of detention, that there 
are no conditions of bail that would assure the defendant's presence in court proceedings in this 
case or protect the safety of the community, and that any application for bail should be denied.

Okay great. I reached out to 
at BOP to get an answer on their text reader capabilities. Apparently, their computers 
are equipped with text readers (as suspected). I'm still waiting to hear back on the specific program(s) that they use. I 
figured it would be useful to know and/or include in the next discovery cover letter so that defense can't claim that she 
has no capability to open those files.

Thanks for flagging. Let's produce in their original format to both for now. If Maxwell has trouble opening them at MDC, 
we'll deal with that after she tells us she can't open them. She has not identified every single excel and txt file from past 
productions as problematic, so she will hopefully be able to open these.

How are we handling producing to Maxwell vs. Counsel? With these files there are tons of text and excel files that need to 
be converted in order to be sent to MDC. Are we also producing the converted versions to defense or rather the original 
natives?

No way to put a confidential stamp on a excel file. There should be an image placeholder that says document produced in 
native format which has the confidential stamp.

These look great. One quick question, on documents in native format (excel files) is there a confidential 
stamp? I've checked and it seems the answer is no but I just want to be sure that I'm not missing anything.

1. 
Yes, we want to mark all of them confidential 
2. 
We are working on that. 
3. 
I suppose database load files? We want to retain the files as they are currently formatted as best we can. 
4. 
That won't be an issue. I don't think we will be searching through them; the purpose is just to be able to stamp 
them.

1. 
Will you placing a Confidential stamp on these documents? 
2. 
What bates number do you wish to use on the documents? 
3. 
How do you want to produce the documents (single page tiff images, database load files or PDF production). 
4. 
Also please note that once the documents have been loaded to Relativity there is no way to run any searches for 
these images since they are mostly images and video. 
Please let me know if there are any questions.

We have some materials that we need uploaded to Relativity to the Epstein database for the purpose of stamping them. 
The files in question number about 40,000 and are about 300GB in size. They are currently copying onto a drive to be sent 
to Relativity and should be ready by tomorrow. Do you want to see them first or can they go directly to PAE?

Thank you. We have not interviewed this witness, so we have not confirmed the details about where the abuse 
happened, who the perpetrator was, or how old she was when it happened. What we do know is (1) she is currently in 
(2) she is a Enational, and (3) according to her lawyer, she recently made a statement to the Met Police 
reporting some sort of past abuse by Jeffrey Epstein (and not necessarily the full scope of the information she may have 
in connection with our investigation), so we would be open to the possibility of sharing her name with the Met Police if, 
in your view, that was necessary. 
We are preparing travel paperwork on our end, and will try to get this moving quickly. Thanks so much for your 
guidance on this.

One other question. If there is anything that would implicate UK government interests in 
this witness (other than any connection with witness PA) - if she was assaulted in 
connection with a UK gov't function, or was a UK gov't employee, etc. - that would also be 
helpful to know.

In speaking with LEGAT colleagues about how to do this without disclosing the witness 
identity, they said the UK will want to know if the conduct is also a UK crime. So a few 
questions: 
is the victim a UK national; 
did the alleged conduct occur on UK soil; 
if the conduct occurred elsewhere, was the perp a UK national and the victim under age (I 
think it has to be under age 16)? 
Also, what country is the victim currently in - England/Wales; Scotland, or N. Ireland (they 
each have their own procedures)? 
Did the victim ever report the conduct to UK law enforcement?

THE OFFICE OF THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL 
FROM: 
UNITED STATES ATTORNEY 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
PHONE: 
DISTRICT POC: 
U.S. Attorney 
SYNOPSIS: 
The USAO-SDNY plans to offer deferred prosecution agreements to two correctional officers, Tova Noel and Michael 
Thomas, who were employed at the Manhattan Correctional Center ("MCC") and were previously charged with 
making false statements and conspiring to (i) make false statements and (ii) interfere with or obstruct the lawful 
function of the MCC. These charges, which were brought in November 2019, stem from the correctional officers' 
falsification of institutional count and round forms on the night that Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide. The deferred 
prosecution agreements will require, among other things, the defendants to cooperate with a pending Office of 
Inspector General investigation by providing truthful information about the events in question; an admission of guilt 
EFTA00029061
--- PAGE 2 ---
from both defendants as to the conduct set forth in the indictment; and for both defendants to complete 100 hours of 
community service, preferably in an area related to the criminal justice system. The USAO-SDNY plans to file a public 
letter by Friday, May 21 notifying the Court of the defendants' acceptance of the deferred prosecution agreements and 
seeking a hearing date; the USAO-SDNY anticipates that the deferred prosecution agreements will be entered by the 
Court by the following Friday, May 28. 
DESCRIPTION: 
On November 14, 2019, USAO-SDNY obtained an indictment against Tova Noel and Michael Thomas which charged 
them with multiple counts of making false statements, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001, and conspiring to (i) make false 
statements and (ii) interfere with or obstruct the lawful function of the MCC, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371. As alleged 
in the Indictment, on August 9 and 10, 2019, the defendants falsely indicated on Bureau of Prison forms that they had 
completed required institutional counts and rounds. On August 10, 2019, inmate Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide 
while housed in the Special Housing Unit at the MCC. After discovering Epstein's body, the defendants admitted to 
their supervisor that they had failed to conduct at least some of the required counts and rounds. The falsification of 
records occurred prior to their discovery of Epstein's body. 
The USAO-SDNY plans to offer deferred prosecution agreements to both defendants. The USAO-SDNY has determined 
that deferring the defendants' prosecution is an outcome consistent with the interests of justice, the mitigating 
personal circumstances of the defendants, and the Department's practice in the overwhelming majority of other cases 
in which correctional officers have been investigated or charged with falsifying count or round forms. As a condition of 
the defendants' agreement, they will be required to admit their guilt and cooperate by providing truthful information 
with the Office of Inspector General, which is preparing a report on, among other things, their conduct on the night in 
question, the circumstances in which they discovered Epstein's body after his suicide, and the institutional failures that 
led to Epstein's death at the MCC The agreement does not preclude any administrative action or termination by the 
Bureau of Prisons. The defendants will also be subject to pretrial supervision for six months, must refrain from 
committing any crimes, and will be required to complete 100 hours of community service. This outcome is supported 
by the investigative agencies, the Department of Justice, Office of the Inspector General, as well as the Federal Bureau 
of Investigation, and has been approved by Pretrial Services. The USAO-SDNY plans to send a public letter by May 21, 
2021 to notify the Court that the Government has offered, and the defendants have accepted, deferred prosecution 
agreements, and in order to request a hearing date, which the Government expects to be scheduled for the following 
week, by May 28.

All, 
Per the attached, the Court granted the one-week extension in the Epstein FOIA. So the production is now due next 
Friday, July 2. Please let me know if you foresee any issues with that date. 
Please also let me know if you need anything else from me in terms of the processes we discussed yesterday. We are 
working with BOP to finalize the production, but please let me know if I should take steps beyond that (e.g., letting 
additional people know about the production, etc.). 
Also, does anyone want to see the production before it goes out? 
Thanks,

We understand you had been planning to make the Noel/Thomas FOIA disclosure on Friday. We just ran this by =, 
and she'd like you to ask for a brief (1-2 week) extension to enable us to confer internally regarding the interviews, which 
were just completed, to confirm we agree they've fulfilled that requirement of their deferred prosecution agreements. 
She's going to speak with

Ghislaine Maxwell moves to suppress all evidence the government obtained from a grand 
jury subpoena it issued to Boies Schiller Flexner LLP and to dismiss Counts Five and Six, which 
are the fruits of that unlawful subpoena. 
INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT 
Counts Five and Six allege that Maxwell committed perjury during two civil depositions 
conducted by Boies Schiller in a defamation action it filed against Maxwell on behalf of one of 
the firm's clients. 
v. Marvell, Case No. 15-cv-7433 (LAP) (S.D.N.Y). A Protective 
Order entered in that case prohibited the parties and their lawyers from sharing confidential 
discovery material (including the two Maxwell depositions) with anyone else, including with the 
government and law enforcement. Faced with that Protective Order, the government issued a 
grand jury subpoena for Boies Schiller's file and instituted an ex parte proceeding before Chief 
Judge McMahon to modify the Protective Order. By proceeding ex pane, the government 
ensured that no one before the court would be able to contest the accuracy of its representations 
in support of its application. 
The government then took full advantage. Judge McMahon, citing this Court's decision 
in Chemical Bank v. Affiliated FM Ins. Co., 154 F.R.D. 91 (S.D.N.Y. 1994), asked the 
government, point blank, whether Southern District prosecutors had previously met with the 
Boies Schiller firm or otherwise "collu[ded]" with that firm in arranging the discovery request. 
The government lawyer assured Judge McMahon that the prosecutors had no idea what was in 
Boies Schiller's file. Indeed, he insisted, there had been no contact whatsoever between Boies 
Schiller and United States Attorney's Office before the government commenced its investigation. 
Nor, said the prosecutor, did Boies Schiller have any role instigating the Maxwell inquiry. 
EFTA00029082
--- PAGE 7 ---
To paraphrase Mary McCarthy's philippic about Lillian Hellman, every word of the 
government's representation was untrue, "including 'and' and `the." The government knew 
what was in the Boies Schiller file; the law firm had provided that information well before the 
investigation began. The government did indeed have previous contact with the firm. And Boies 
Schiller was instrumental in fomenting the Maxwell prosecution. 
The record is surpassingly clear: But for the government's misrepresentation, witting or 
not, Judge McMahon never would have permitted the circumvention of the civil Protective 
Order, on which Maxwell relied in agreeing to sit for her depositions. This Court therefore has 
both the authority and the duty to suppress the fruits of that misrepresentation, including the 
deposition transcripts and the two perjury counts based on those transcripts. If the Court is 
disinclined to exercise that inherent authority on the present record, Maxwell should be granted a 
hearing to examine the circumstances that resulted in the government's misrepresentations to 
Judge McMahon. 
FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
A. The Protective Order in 
v. Maxwell 
Counts Five and Six of the superseding indictment allege that Maxwell committed 
perjury during two civil depositions taken in 
v. Maxwell, a civil defamation case 
filed in 2015. 
claimed that Maxwell defamed her when Maxwell's attorney-hired 
press agent denied as "untrue" and "obvious lies" 
numerous allegations, over the span 
of four years, that Maxwell had participated in a scheme to cause 
to be "sexually abused 
and trafficked" by Jeffrey Epstein.

Times.

, a public figure required to prove actual malice, had an uphill battle—even she 
was constrained to acknowledge that many of her public statements were false. Using a time-
honored if unfortunate litigation tactic, her lawyers at Boies Schiller therefore sought to turn the 
lawsuit into a proxy prosecution of Epstein. Not surprisingly, discovery in the case was bitter, 
hard-fought, and wide-ranging. It spanned more than a year and included large document 
productions, many responses to interrogatories, and thirty-some depositions, including 
depositions of 
and Maxwell as well as several third parties. See Brown v. Maxwell, 929 
F.3d 41, 46, 51 (2d Cir. 2019) (explaining that discovery was "hard-fought" and "extensive" and 
noting that the court file, which includes only some of the documents created during discovery, 
totals in the "thousands of pages"). 
sought and obtained a wide variety of private and confidential information about 
Maxwell and others, including information about financial and sexual matters. Brown, 929 F.3d 
at 48 n.22. Given the intimate and highly confidential nature of the discovery exchanged between 
the parties, the district court entered a stipulated Protective Order. See Ex. A. The Protective 
Order included a mechanism for one party to challenge another party's confidentiality 
designation (such a challenge never occurred) and provided that it did not apply to any 
information or material disclosed at trial. (Because the case settled before trial, that sole 
exception to the Protective Order was never triggered.) 
Notably, Boies Schiller sought to add a "law enforcement" exception to the Protective 
Order, doubtless because the firm was eager to enlist the government in its campaign against 
Maxwell. In particular, Boies Schiller proposed to include a provision stating that 
"CONFIDENTIAL information shall not be disclosed or used for any purpose except the 
preparation and trial of this case and any related matter, including but not limited to, 
investigations by law enforcement." Ex. Bil(a)(4) (emphasis supplied). Maxwell flatly rejected 
EFTA00029084
--- PAGE 9 ---
this proposal, and it was never included in the Protective Order. Ex. A.2 To the contrary, the 
order strictly limited the parties' disposition of Confidential Material, including at the conclusion 
of the case. In particular, paragraph 12 of the order provided that: 
[a]t the conclusion of this case, unless other arrangements are agreed upon, each 
document and all copies thereof which have been designated as CONFIDENTIAL 
shall be returned to the party that designated it CONFIDENTIAL, or the parties 
may elect to destroy CONFIDENTIAL documents. Where the parties agree to 
destroy CONFIDENTIAL documents, the destroying party shall provide all parties 
with an affidavit confirming destruction. 
Ex. Al 12. 
B. Maxwell's April and July 2016 depositions 
Relying on the confidentiality protections of the Protective Order, Maxwell declined to 
invoke her privilege against compulsory self-incrimination and agreed to testify at her April 
2016 deposition. In that deposition, 
attorneys asked Maxwell whether "Jeffrey Epstein 
[had] a scheme to recruit underage girls for sexual massages? If you know." Maxwell replied, "I 
don't know what you're talking about." And when asked to "[I]ist all the people under the age of 
that you interacted with at any of Jeffrey's properties," Maxwell responded, "I'm not aware of 
anybody that I interacted with, other than obviously [=I 
who was 17 at this point." Count 
Five of the superseding indictment alleges those two answers were false. 
Following the deposition, 
moved to compel Maxwell to answer additional 
intimate and personal questions that she had previously declined to answer. In support of the 
motion, Boies Schiller assured the district court that "[s]uch questions are entirely appropriate in 
the discovery phase of this case, particularly where any answers will be maintained as 
confidential under the Protective Order in this case." 
'This proposal was rejected because of justifiable concerns about the misuse and abuse of this 
information by plaintiff and her lawyers including the selection and misleading leaking of confidential 
material to the media, other false claimants, and the government. 
EFTA00029085
--- PAGE 10 ---
The district court granted the motion. In requiring Maxwell to answer highly intrusive 
questions "relating to [her] own sexual activity" and "her knowledge of the sexual activity of 
others," the court held that Maxwell's "privacy concerns are alleviated by the protective order in 
this case." 
Secure in the belief that the Protective Order would be honored, Maxwell appeared at a 
second deposition, in July 2016. and answered hundreds of pages worth of questions about her 
"own sexual activity" and "her knowledge of the sexual activities of others." From the very first 
question, Maxwell discussed the intimate details of her sexual activity with Epstein, with other 
adult men, with other adult women, the use of sex toys, participation in "threesomes," and a full 
gamut of other sordid sexual topics. She was asked where she had sex, when she had sex, with 
whom she had sex, what types of sexual predilections Epstein had, whether others watched her 
having sex, whether she watched other people having sex, and whether she slept with clothes on. 
She was asked whether Epstein had sex with any number of women, and the names of women he 
might have had sex with. Maxwell was also grilled extensively about massages: when, where, 
what she was wearing, who gave them. 
Count Six of the superseding indictment alleges that Maxwell provided false testimony 
when she testified during her July 2016 deposition that: (1) she could not recall whether sex toys 
or devices were used in sexual activities at Epstein's Palm Beach house; (2) she did not know 
whether Epstein possessed sex toys or devices used in sexual activities; (3) she wasn't aware that 
Epstein was having sexual activities with anyone other than herself when she was with him; and 
(4) she never gave anyone, including Accuser-23, a massage. 
The indictment refers to the accusers as Minor Victim-I, Minor Victim-2, and Minor Victim-3. 
We will refer to them as Accuser-1, Accuser-2, and Accuser-3.

C. The Settlement And Boies Schiller's Refusal To Comply With The 
Protective Order 
In 2017, the parties settled the defamation claim, and the case was dismissed. 
v. 
Maxwell, 325 F. Supp. 3d 428, 436 (S.D.N.Y. 2018), vacated and remanded sub nom. Brown, 
929 F.3d 41. As the district court found, "a significant, if not determinative, factor" in reaching a 
settlement was its confidentiality. Id. at 446. 
After the case was settled and concluded, Maxwell repeatedly invoked Paragraph 12 of 
the Protective Order and demanded that 
either return or destroy all confidential 
information, including her deposition transcripts. Boies Schiller refused. Instead, and 
unbeknownst to Maxwell, Boies Schiller produced some 90,000 pages of discovery material to 
the government, including both of Maxwell's deposition transcripts. 
D. The Government's False Statements To Judge McMahon 
Only in August 2020, after she was indicted in this case, did Maxwell finally learn that 
the government had obtained the Boies Schiller file by grand jury subpoena. Maxwell also 
learned that, to overcome the strictures of the Protective Order, the government had instituted an 
ex parte proceeding before Judge McMahon, Case No. 19-Misc.-149 (CM) (S.D.N.Y). Ex. C. 
Needless to say, neither Maxwell nor her attorneys were given the opportunity to oppose that 
application or to contest the government's representations in support of the application. This was 
all in direct violation of Paragraph 14 of the Protective Order, which provides that the order may 
be modified by the court only "for good cause shown following notice to all parties and an 
opportunity to be heard." Ex. A Y 14 (emphasis added). 
In its ex parte application, the prosecutors professed that they had sought out Boies 
Schiller's file only because "publicly available information regarding the [ 
v. Maxwell] 
EFTA00029087
--- PAGE 12 ---
Litigation, including the complaint and other docketed filings ... appear[ed] to make reference 
to certain subjects relating to the Investigation." That "publicly available information," the 
government claimed, indicated that the Boies Schiller file might "contain information relevant to 
the ongoing Investigation" of Jeffrey Epstein. Ex. C,1 4. Nowhere did the government 
acknowledge that Boies Schiller had in fact approached the prosecutors multiple times well 
before the grand jury subpoena issued. 
In March 2019, in the first appearance before Judge McMahon, the Government 
continued this refrain, professing ignorance about what was in Boies Schiller's file or who was 
deposed in the case. The prosecutor defended the subpoena's breadth—which sought all "copies 
of discovery and related materials" in 
v. Maxwell-o n the ground that the government 
simply had too little knowledge of what was in the law firm's files to craft a more narrowly 
tailored subpoena: 
Here, we are essentially unable to significantly narrow the request for information 
in part for exactly the reasons that you describe. We have either little or no 
additional information than the Court does in terms of what materials there are, who 
was deposed, and that is in marked contrast to some of the other cases. 
Ex. D, p 17. For all the government knew, according to the Assistant U.S. Attorney, what he was 
seeking was "page after page of people taking the Fifth." Ex. D, p 19. 
The government appeared a second time before Judge McMahon in April 2019. Ex. E. 
Judge McMahon held that conference for one reason: to learn "about contacts between the 
United States Attorney's Office and the Boies Schiller law firm prior to the issuance of the 
subpoena." Ex. E, p 2. The Assistant U.S. Attorney told Judge McMahon that the government's 
investigation began on either November 30 or December 3, 2018, omitting mention of any 
contacts between Boies Schiller and the government prior to that time: 
In the initial days and weeks of the investigation, we endeavored to identify 
information about the subject of the investigation, including, among other things, 
EFTA00029088
--- PAGE 13 ---
possible victims who we should speak to. In the process of doing so, we identified 
certain counsel that were identified as representing victims or witnesses either in 
public filings or in media reports. Boies Schiller was among those plaintiff 
attorneys. So following the opening of the investigation, we were in touch with 
Boies Schiller, among other plaintiff and witness counsel, in connection with their 
representation of witnesses or victims. 
With respect to Boies Schiller in particular, we quickly came to learn during 
the investigation that they had at the time either active or recently completed civil 
litigation and so asked them, as is our standard practice, told them, I should say, 
that we expected to make document requests. They generally advised us that they 
believed there was a protective order that would govern at least some of the 
materials, and that is why we ultimately made the application to the Court. 
Ex. E, 99 pp 2-3. 
Those representations were false. At the time the government claims it began the 
investigation (late November or early December 2018), its knowledge of the civil case was not 
based exclusively on public filings. It knew that Boies Schiller possessed relevant information 
because the firm had come to the government asking it to open an investigation. In particular, on 
February 29, 2016, AUSA 
met with attorneys from Boies Schiller, who "urged 
to open an investigation of Epstein and Maxwell!' Then, after Maxwell's two 
depositions, David Boies himself apparently approached the government in the summer of 2016, 
asking "if the Southern District would consider charging Maxwell with perjury." Brown, supra 
n.2. Said Mr. Boies: 
"We were saying to anyone who would listen: We've got clients who were abused. 
Some of them were underage. We have the evidence. There's a whole record that's 
been developed. We can establish beyond any reasonable doubt there was a massive 
sex trafficking ring going on."

jinz117zdrzdgrbbs7yc6bfnszu-stoty.htnal. 
EFTA00029089
--- PAGE 14 ---
At that time, however, the government did not act. Boles "was particularly frustrated by 
the failure to pursue a perjury charge [against Maxwell]," reported one person, who recalled him 
saying, "We have her dead to rights."5 Id. All of this contradicts The government's 
representations to Judge McMahon, who specifically asked if the government had any contact 
with Boies Schiller before it issued the subpoena. 
Reassured by the government that no contact had occurred, Judge McMahon modified 
the Protective Order so that Boles Schiller could comply with the subpoena. Ex. F. Judge 
McMahon found that Maxwell could not have reasonably relied on the Protective Order as 
prohibiting Boies Schiller from cooperating with the government. In making this finding, Judge 
McMahon relied on the Assistant U.S. Attorney's misrepresentations, and she distinguished the 
government's subpoena to Boies Schiller from the subpoena at issue in Chemical Bank. Said 
Judge McMahon: 
[T]hecaihing on which Maxwell or anyone else might reasonably have relied is 
that 
or her lawyers would not do what the defendant in Chemical Bank 
did—that is, forward discovery materials in their possession to prosecutors for the 
purpose of fomenting an investigation. But I am not faced with that situation. 
Nothing in this record suggests to me that 
or Boies Schiller had anything to 
do with the Government's decision to convene a grand jury to look into the matters 
that were the subject of the 
Action. On the contrary—the Government has 
advised the Court that it contacted Boies Schiller as part of its search for parties 
who might have been victims in its investigation; and that Boies Schiller told the 
Government that it could not consensually produce at least some documents in its 
files because of the existence of the Protective Order. There is no evidence of 
"collusion," to invoke a term of the moment, and it is quite clear that Boles Schiller 
did not foment the Government's investigation. Moreover, the Assistant United 
States Attorney has represented to this Court that he has no idea what is in Boies 
Schiller's files, and that for all he knows every witness who was deposed stood on 
his/her Fifth Amendment rights and refused to answer questions. 
Ex. G, p 21. 
Ms. Maxwell strenuously disagrees with Mr. Boles' comments. We reference them here only to 
show their connection to the perjury counts that the government subsequently charged. 
EFTA00029090
--- PAGE 15 ---
Contrary to the government's misrepresentations, Boies Schiller did foment the 
investigation (or at least it tried to). And the evidence of "collusion" between the government 
and Boies Schiller was ample, tracing to at least early 2016 and precisely designed to have 
Maxwell charged with perjury.° Had Judge McMahon known the truth, she likely would have 
denied the government's application to modify the 
v. Maxwell Protective Order, and the 
government would have been unable to secure a copy of Boies Schiller's ninety-thousand-page 
file, including Maxwell's two deposition transcripts. 
E. Judge Netburn Separately Rejects An Identical Gambit By The 
Government 
Around the same time that Judge McMahon granted the government's ex parte request, 
Magistrate Judge Netburn rejected an identical request from the government in a different civil 
case, Jane Doe 43 v. Epstein, Case No. 17-cv-616 (JGK) (SN). Judge Netbum recognized the 
government's conduct for what it was: an attempt to deprive Maxwell of notice and an 
opportunity to be heard. Ex. H. Indeed, Judge Netbum rebuffed the government even after it 
alerted her to Judge McMahon's order. Ex. I. As Judge Netbum found, the government's 
"abstract concern" about the "secrecy" of its investigation—a concern that exists with any 
investigation and is hardly unique to this case—could not overcome the parties' reasonable 
reliance on the Protective Order or justify the government's secret, ex parte application. Ex. H, p 
6. Judge Netburn also implicitly recognized what Judge McMahon never knew—that Boies 
Schiller was all too eager for the government to investigate and prosecute Maxwell: 
Maxwell has not yet been provided discovery of whether Boies Schiller shared actual sealed 
materials or the contents of sealed materials during its meetings with the United States Attorney's Office 
in 2016. As noted below, the bare minimum that is required here is an evidentiary hearing to probe the 
extent to which Boies Schiller "colluded," in a Chemical Bank sense, with the prosecutor's office. 
EFTA00029091
--- PAGE 16 ---
[T]he extraordinary posture of the case requires the Court to police carefully 
government intrusions into areas of protections agreed to by civil litigants and so-
ordered by the Court. The Government is attempting to side-step these protections 
by serving a subpoena only upon a party who is willing (and perhaps eager) to 
comply with the Government's investigation. 
Ex. H, p 6. 
ARGUMENT 
A. Pursuant To Its Inherent Power, This Court Should Suppress The 
Evidence Obtained From Boies Schiller, And Dismiss Counts Five And 
Six, Which Are The Fruits Of That Evidence 
1. The role of protective orders in civil litigation. 
Protective orders serve a "vital function" in civil litigation. Martindell v. Intl Tel. & Tel. 
Corp., 594 F.2d 291, 295 (2d Cir. 1979). They promote "the `secure the just, speedy, and 
inexpensive determination' of civil disputes, by encouraging full disclosure of all evidence." Id. 
(quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 1). "If protective orders were easily modified . . . parties would be less 
forthcoming in giving testimony and less willing to settle their disputes." S.E.C. v. 
TheStreet.Com, 273 F.3d 222, 230 (2d Cir. 2001). In particular, as here, "witnesses might be 
expected frequently to refuse to testify pursuant to protective orders if their testimony were to be 
made available to the Government for criminal investigatory purposes in disregard of those 
orders." Martindell, 594 F.2d at 295-96. Parties thus rely on protective orders, and courts strictly 
enforce them. See, e.g., Stewart v. Hudson Hall LLC, 20 Civ. 885 (SLC), 2020 WL 7239676, at 
*2 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 9, 2020) ("In the Second Circuit, there is a strict standard for modification of 
a protective order entered by a district court." (citation and quotation marks omitted)). 
This case illustrates just how crucial a protective order is. The Maxwell depositions 
sought highly intrusive evidence of the most personal aspects of Maxwell's life. Her sexual 
practices. Her sexual preferences. Her sexual partners. In urging the district court to permit these 
extraordinary intrusions—in what should have been a simple defamation case-Boies Schiller 
I 
EFTA00029092
--- PAGE 17 ---
expressly invoked the assurances of the Protective Order. So did the district court in permitting 
these intrusions and ordering Maxwell to sit for a second deposition. Maxwell likewise relied on 
the Protective Order in choosing to render such intimate details, rather than assert her Fifth 
Amendment privilege as she had every right to do. 
And why shouldn't Maxwell have relied on the Protective Order? The central protection 
in the Order was that none of Maxwell's answers could be disclosed to the government. Boies 
Schiller had expressly sought a law enforcement exception but was rebuffed. Instead, the law 
firm was required either to return the confidential material or, at Maxwell's option, to destroy it. 
Maxwell had every reason to take that assurance seriously, even if Boies Schiller did not. 
2. The government circumvented the protective order. 
Faced with a duly entered Protective Order—which quite deliberately omitted any "law 
enforcement" exception—the government had lawful options to pursue the confidential 
discovery. It could have moved to intervene in the civil case and to amend the Protective Order. 
It could have issued a subpoena for the materials and given Maxwell an opportunity to respond. 
Martindell, 594 F.2d at 294. It could even have applied for a search warrant, assuming 
(counterfactually) that it could show probable cause in support of such a warrant. 
The government did none of those things. Instead, it initiated an ex parte proceeding and 
secured a secret modification of the Protective Order based on material misrepresentations to the 
presiding judge. This was not among the lawful options available to the government. 
It cannot fairly be disputed that Judge McMahon's ruling to amend the Protective Order 
was based on the government's misrepresentations. Immediately before issuing her decision, 
Judge McMahon held a hearing with the sole purpose of asking the prosecutor, point blank, 
about the government's contacts with Boies Schiller. Judge McMahon's stated reason for so 
inquiring was to ensure that the government and Boies Schiller had not coordinated as the parties 
EFTA00029093
--- PAGE 18 ---
had in the Chemical Bank case. In no uncertain terms, Judge McMahon explained why she had 
haled the prosecutor back into court: 
I'll be very up-front with you. I want to make sure I'm not in a Chemical Bank kind 
of situation, so I would like to know about contacts between the United States 
Attorney's Office and the Boies Schiller firm prior to the issuance of the subpoena 
on the subject of your investigation. 
Ex. E, p 2. 
In Chemical Bank, a protective order precluded parties to a civil case from disclosing 
confidential documents to others. 154 F.R.D. at 92-93. Despite this prohibition, counsel for the 
defendant approached the Manhattan District Attorney's Office and suggested that it had 
evidence of criminal violations relating to the case. Id. at 93. A grand jury issued a subpoena, 
and the defendant produced to the government various confidential documents without 
complying with any of the specific procedures or exceptions provided in the protective order. Id. 
Once this collusion came to light, the district court reprimanded the defendant for its "disregard 
of the [protective] order[]" and admonished its behavior as "contrary to the traditions of the Bar 
which dictate that court orders be respected." Id. 
In addressing the government's application here, Judge McMahon specifically asked 
whether Boies Schiller had acted as the defendant did in Chemical Bank. The prosecutor omitted 
any mention of his office's previous meetings with the firm, and falsely led the court to believe 
that Boies Schiller had not encouraged its investigation. Reassured by the misrepresentations, 
Judge McMahon commented: 
Nothing in this record suggests to me that 
or Boies Schiller had anything to 
do with the Government's decision to convene a grand jury to look into the matters 
that were the subject of the 
Action. On the contrary—the Government has 
advised the Court that it contacted Boies Schiller as part of its search for parties 
who might have been victims in its investigation; and that Boies Schiller told the 
Government that it could not consensually produce at least some documents in its 
files because of the existence of the Protective Order. There is no evidence of 
EFTA00029094
--- PAGE 19 ---
"collusion," to invoke a term of the moment, and it is quite clear that Boies Schiller 
did not foment the Government's investigation. 
Had Judge McMahon known the truth, she likely would not have granted the government's 
application to modify the Protective Order to allow Boies Schiller to comply with the subpoena. 
3. The government violated due process. 
The government's conduct cannot be squared with elemental due process. U.S. CONST. 
amend. V. Pursuant to this guarantee, "[t]he responsibility of a public prosecutor differs from 
that of the usual advocate; his duty is to seek justice, not merely to convict." Young v. United 
States, 481 U.S. 787, 803 (1987). The government engages in misconduct and violates due 
process when it materially misrepresents facts before a court. See United States v. Valentine, 820 
F.2d 565, 570 (2d Cir. 1987) (holding that the government violated due process and reversing 
conviction when the government mischaracterized the substance of grand jury testimony). 
The prosecutor may well have known that his representations to Judge McMahon were 
false (or at best misleading). But the Assistant U.S. Attorney's personal knowledge doesn't 
matter. "An individual prosecutor is presumed . . . to have knowledge of all information gathered 
in connection with his office's investigation of the case." United States v. Avellino, 136 F.3d 249, 
255 (2d Cir. 1998); see also Giglio v. U.S., 405 U.S. 150, 154 (1972) ("The prosecutor's office is 
an entity and as such it is the spokesman for the Government. A promise made by one attorney 
must be attributed, for these purposes, to the Government."). At the barest minimum, a federal 
prosecutor has a duty to check the entire file to ensure that his representations to a federal judge, 
submitted on behalf of the office he serves and under oath, are true and complete. The Assistant 
U.S. Attorney did not discharge that basic function. 
EFTA00029095
--- PAGE 20 ---
4. This court possesses the inherent authority to order suppression. 
Incident to its inherent power to superintend proceedings, this Court has the authority to 
suppress the fruits of the government's misrepresentation. See, e.g., United States v. Cortina, 630 
F.3d 1207, 1214 (7th Cir. 1980) ("The court has inherent authority to regulate the administration 
of criminal justice among the parties before the bar .... [by] exclud[ing] evidence taken from 
the defendant by willful disobedience of law." (citation omitted)); United States v. Iambus, 897 
F.3d 368, 386 (2d Cir. 2018) ("It is within the court's inherent authority to suppress evidence 
gathered unlawfully in order to maintain the integrity of its own proceedings . . . ."); Benkovitch 
v. Gorilla, Inc., No. 2:15-cv-7806 (WJM), 2017 WL 4005452, at *2 (D.N.J. Sept. 12, 2017) 
("District courts have `inherent authority' to impose a variety of sanctions, including ... 
suppression of evidence . . . ."). 
It does not matter that the government made its misrepresentations to Judge McMahon 
and not directly to this Court. "As long as a party receives an appropriate hearing, ... the party 
may be sanctioned for abuses of process occurring beyond the courtroom . . ." Chambers v. 
NASCO, Inc., 510 U.S. 32, 57 (1991). "Courts have held that inherent authority sanctions may be 
imposed for misconduct in another court where the misconduct is . . . in some way related to the 
case before the sanctioning court." Klein v. Weidner, Civ. No. 08-3798, 2017 WL 2834260, at *6 
(E.D. Pa. June 30, 2017) (citation and alteration omitted); Manhattan Review LLC v. Yen, 16 
Civ. 0102 (LAK) (JCF), 2017 WL 11455317, *7 n.3 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 21, 2017) ("The inherent 
power ... can punish conduct before a different court if it is intimately related to the relevant 
case." (citing Klein, 2017 WL 2834260, at *4)). Here, the government's misrepresentation to 
Judge McMahon was not simply "related" to Counts Five and Six; only by the government's 
deception was it able to obtain the factual predicate for those counts. Accordingly, the Court may 
exercise its inherent authority to suppress that evidence. And it should. 
EFTA00029096
--- PAGE 21 ---
B. At A Minimum, This Court Should Order A Hearing At Which Maxwell 
May Inquire Into The Circumstances Surrounding The Government's 
Misrepresentations To Judge McMahon 
If the Court is disinclined to grant relief on the present record, then at a minimum it 
should hold an evidentiary hearing to probe the government's misstatements to Judge McMahon 
and the extent to which the prosecutor's office had, in fact, coordinated with Boies Schiller prior 
to the issuance of the grand jury subpoena. These factual issues go directly to whether the 
predicate finding for Judge McMahon's ruling—namely, that no Chemical Bank collusion had 
occurred—was mistaken. See, e.g., United States v. Paredes-Cordova, No. SI 03 CR. 987DAB, 
2009 WL 1585776, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. June 8, 2009) ("An evidentiary hearing is normally required 
to address motions to suppress where a factual issue is in dispute."). 
An evidentiary hearing is warranted for an additional reason as well: If it turns out that 
the prosecutor knew (or was reckless in not knowing) that Boies Schiller had previously 
approached his office, both before and after the Maxwell depositions, in an effort to stir up a 
criminal prosecution and dangled the deposition transcripts as a carrot, then suppression would 
be warranted on that basis alone. Cf. Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 155-56 (1978); United 
States v. Rajaratnani, 719 F.3d 139, 146 (2d Cir. 2013) ("Franks instructs a district court to hold 
a hearing to determine whether the alleged misstatements or omissions in the warrant or wiretap 
application were made intentionally or with reckless disregard for the truth and, if so, whether 
any such misstatements or omissions were material."). 
CONCLUSION 
For these reasons, this Court should: (1) suppress all evidence the government obtained 
from Boies Schiller and any other evidence derived therefrom; or (2) suppress the April and July 
2016 depositions and all evidence derived therefrom; and (3) dismiss Counts Five and Six. 
Maxwell requests an evidentiary hearing on this Motion.

Ghislaine Maxwell submits this reply in support of her Motion to suppress all evidence 
the government obtained from a grand jury subpoena it issued to Boies Schiller Flexner LLP and 
to dismiss Counts Five and Six, which are the fruits of that unlawful subpoena. 
Introduction and Summary of the Argument 
If the government meant to reassure this Court that nothing improper happened, its 
Response was anything but reassuring. 
The government now confesses that it had significant and substantial contact with 
attorneys in 2016—while the 
defamation suit against Maxwell was 
on-going—as part of an effort to instigate a criminal prosecution of Maxwell for allegedly 
trafficking 
and others and then lying under oath. Doubling down on an increasingly 
farfetched story, however, the government insists that nothing improper occurred when it 
misrepresented these contacts to the Chief Judge of the Southern District of New York. 
Contrary to the government's portrayal of events, what happened here is that a prosecutor 
from the public corruption unit of the United States Attorney's Office, in an a parte proceeding, 
affirmatively misled Chief Judge McMahon to circumvent a Protective Order entered by one of 
her colleagues. The prosecutor then exploited the material he obtained to indict Maxwell. 
Had the prosecutor not affirmatively misled Judge McMahon, the government would 
never have obtained the 90,000 pages of material it now possesses, material that is central—
indeed, essential—to its case against Maxwell. It would be the height of irony, not to mention 
injustice, to allow the government to convict Maxwell of testifying falsely when the government 
could not have indicted Maxwell but for the false statements it made to a federal judge. 
"In a situation like this, the judiciary ... may exercise its supervisory power to make it 
clear that the misconduct was serious, that the government's unwillingness to own up to it was 
more serious still, and that steps must be taken to avoid a recurrence of this chain of events." 
EFTA00029105
--- PAGE 7 ---
Wang v. Reno, 81 F.3d 808, 821 (9th Cir. 1996). For the reasons given below, the exercise of this 
Court's supervisory authority is called for here. 
I. The Facts 
Pressed into some minimal measure of candor, the government now admits the following 
facts are true: 
• 
On February 29, 2016, AUSA M, 
the Human Trafficking Coordinator and 
Project Safe Childhood Coordinator for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern 
District of New York, Ex. J, p 1, met with Peter Skinner of Boies Schiller, Stan 
Pottinger, and Brad Edwards, who represented 
M, 
Ex. K, p I. 
• 
The meeting concerned 
allegations of sexual abuse and trafficking by 
Jeffrey Epstein and Maxwell. Ex. J, pp 1-3. 
• 
At the meeting, 
attorneys told AUSA 
the following: 
o That Maxwell was Epstein's "head recruiter" of underage victims. Id. at 2. 
o That 
was underage when she was brought to New York "for training 
by Maxwell and Epstein [in] how to service men." Id. at 3. 
o That 
had a pending civil lawsuit against Maxwell for defamation 
alleging that Maxwell had recruited 
to be trafficked and abused by 
Epstein. Id. at 4, 7. 
o That Maxwell was asserting truth as a defense to 
defamation claim. 
Id. at 4, 7. 
o That Maxwell had photos of naked underage girls on her computer. Id. at 6.1
' No such photos were found on or produced from any computers associated with Maxwell. 
EFTA00029106
--- PAGE 8 ---
o That Maxwell and Epstein-friend Jean Luc Brunel "took sexually explicit 
photos of [M] 
regularly."2 Id. 
o That, as a birthday present, Maxwell gave Epstein a sexually explicit photo of 
taken when 
was sixteen.3 Id. 
o That Epstein hung the photo on one of his walls.4 Id. 
o That 
has a note in Maxwell's handwriting with the name of another 
victim. Id. at 8.5
o That 
was "live in" sex slave from 2000-2002.6 Id. at 3. 
o That there were other victims of Epstein and Maxwell, including 
id. at 7, who is apparently Accuser-I in this case, and another woman 
whose description matches 
id. at 9, who is apparently 
Accuser-3. 
o That Accuser-I was "highly credible." Id. at 7. 
o That Epstein and Maxwell used "the same MO with" Accuser-3 that they used 
with 
. Id. at 7, 9. 
o And that 
"wants [a] prosecution." Id. at 7. 
Maxwell denies ever taking any photos of M, 
and we have seen no sexually explicit photo 
of 
in any of the civil or criminal document productions. 
Not only did Maxwell not meet 
until 
was seventeen years old, Maxwell never 
provided any such photo to Epstein, nor, to our knowledge, has any such photo ever been produced, in the 
civil or criminal cases. 
Again, we have not seen any such photo produced in any discovery, either in the civil or 
criminal cases. 
We are aware of no note in Maxwell's handwriting being produced in the 
action, or the 
criminal discovery. 
was in fact living with her fiancé at the time and held multiple other jobs, as later 
confirmed through depositions and documents in the 
action. 
EFTA00029107
--- PAGE 9 ---
• 
The attorneys promised to send AUSA 
support their request for a prosecution. Id. at 8. 
• 
Calling the meeting "intriguing," AUSA 
"affidavits and depositions" to 
emailed the Chief of the Criminal 
Division three days later and proposed to "talk over" the facts with him. Ex. M, pp 1-
2. He agreed. Id. at I. 
• In the days and weeks after the February 29 meeting, there were several emails 
between 
attorneys and AUSA 
. Exs. L & 
• 
There was also at least one phone call. Ex. K, at 4. 
• 
attorneys provided AUSA 
with documents as promised. Id. at 2; see 
also Ex. L, p 2. 
Most importantly, the government now admits that AUSA 
the prosecutor in 
charge of the case who appeared before Chief Judge McMahon on April 9, 2019, knew all of this 
and still denied that Boies Schiller had any role in fomenting the investigation and claimed that 
there had been no contacts between Boies Schiller and his office before November 2018, when 
he claimed the investigation first began. 
None of these statements by AUSA 
to Judge McMahon were true. 
As described above, 
attorneys pressed the U.S. Attorney's Office for the 
Southern District of New York to investigate and prosecute Epstein and Maxwell. Ex. J. 
Then, two months after the meeting with AUSA 
attorneys told Judge 
Sweet—who was presiding over 
defamation against Maxwell—that there was an 
EFTA00029108
--- PAGE 10 ---
"ongoing criminal investigation" into Maxwell, and they withheld from discovery 57 separate 
documents, invoking the "law enforcement privilege." Ex. P.7
In late November 2018 and early December 2018-just two months before AUSA 
filed the ex parte request before Judge McMahon seeking modification of the civil 
Protective Order entered by Judge Sweet—AUSA 
shared with AUSA 
as 
well as one other member of the trial team and the heads of the Public Corruption Unit, 
everything she learned from her contacts with 
attorneys. Ex. 
.
AUSA 
gave AUSA 
and his colleagues: (1) nine pages of detailed, 
hand-written notes from the February 29 meeting; (2) the emails she received from 
attorneys; and (3) all the documents provided to her by 
attorneys. Id. Some of what she 
gave AUSA 
included material Boies Schiller attorneys designated a short time later 
as "confidential" under Judge Sweet's Protective Order, including flight records and Palm Beach 
Police Department Records. 
AUSA 
took an active role in gathering these materials from AUSA 
Copying AUSA 
AUSA Kurland had emailed AUSA 
on December 5, 2018, 
to obtain all the records of the February 29 meeting with 
attorneys. Id. at 1. In that 
email, AUSA Kurland also asked AUSA 
whether, after February 29, she met "again 
with [Peter Skinner] or anyone else." Id. 
Two other aspects to the privilege log are notable: (a) In the 
litigation, Boies Schiller 
did not produce its emails with the U.S. Attorney's Office to Maxwell, despite the fact that they were 
directly responsive to a Request for Production of Documents Maxwell served just a couple of weeks 
after those emails were sent; and (b) Peter Skinner, the Boies Schiller attorney at the AUSA 
meeting who also sent emails to AUSA 
after the meeting, Ex. L, is not even listed on the 
privilege log, though the log purports to reflect all email communications about the "ongoing criminal 
investigation" that Boies Schiller had tried to initiate just a couple of weeks earlier. 
EFTA00029109
--- PAGE 11 ---
Barely twelve hours later, when AUSA 
hadn't responded, AUSA 
took it upon himself to follow up, emailing AUSA 
"Just quickly following up on this — 
we're trying to get a complete handle on the landscape — thanks!" Id. 
AUSA 
responded one hour later: "Just went through my files and found a folder 
w/ the notes I took and the documents they brought me." Id. She turned everything over to 
AUSA 
and other prosecutors in the office, including one other prosecutor on this trial 
team. Id. AUSA 
did not answer AUSA Kurland's original question: "[D]id [she] meet 
again with [Peter Skinner] or anyone else" after the February 29, 2016 meeting with 
attorneys. Id. But AUSA 
certainly did not deny a second meeting or a subsequent phone 
call occurred. Id. 
By the end of the day on December 6, 2018, AUSA 
had in his possession 
everything 
and her attorneys provided to AUSA 
as well as AUSA 
extensive hand-written notes. He also had access to AUSA 
herself for any follow up 
questions. By the end of the day, AUSA 
had a "complete handle on the landscape," 
just as he asked for a couple hours earlier. 
When AUSA 
appeared before Judge McMahon barely four months later, 
however, he told her none of this, unequivocally and falsely disavowing any role by Boies 
Schiller in fomenting the investigation and denying any contacts between Boies Schiller and his 
office before November 2018. Even though AUSA 
had a "complete handle on the 
landscape," he painted an entirely different, false picture for Judge McMahon. 
II. The Government's Response to Maxwell's Motion. 
Confronted with evidence of AUSA 
misrepresentations to Judge McMahon, 
the government has filed a Response reluctantly admitting that the U.S. Attorney's Office had 
sustained contact with Boies Schiller in 2016. Even so, the government tries its best to minimize 
EFTA00029110
--- PAGE 12 ---
the significance of those interactions and of AUSA 
misrepresentations to an Article 
III federal judge. This Court should not permit the government to whitewash its conduct. 
The discovery provided to Maxwell in response to her Motion rebuts every defense the 
government now offers of its conduct. And if that weren't enough, the government's defense 
fails on its own terms, because if this Court were to assume its truth (an assumption the 
government has not earned), AUSA 
statements to Judge McMahon would still have 
been demonstratively and materially false. 
A. The Government's Defenses Are Not Credible. 
Discovery provided to Maxwell in response to her Motion rebuts every defense the 
government now offers of its conduct. 
• 
Defense 1: The February 29, 2016 meeting was only about Epstein. 
AUSA 
contemporaneous hand-written notes entirely undermine the 
government's claim that the February 29, 2016 meeting was about Epstein only and had nothing 
to do with Maxwell. Resp. at 89 & 1.39. See Ex. J. AUSA 
notes refer to Maxwell as 
Epstein's "head recruiter" of underage girls; they document allegations that Maxwell "regularly" 
took sexually explicit photos of 
and other underage girls, which she kept on her 
computer; they allege that Maxwell gave one such photo to Epstein as a birthday present, which 
he hung on his wall; they claim that Maxwell, along with Epstein, brought 
to New York 
to personally "train[] [her] . . . [in] how to service men;" and they assert that Maxwell used the 
"same MO" to recruit other girls to the sex trafficking scheme. The contents of AUSA 
notes belie any notion that 
attorneys—who at that very moment were suing Maxwell 
EFTA00029111
--- PAGE 13 ---
for defamation for denying she had trafficked and abused 
were focused only on Epstein 
and not on Maxwell. 
Despite AUSA 
contemporaneous notes showing that the meeting very much 
concerned Maxwell, the government now claims that "the pitch was to investigate Epstein, not 
Maxwell," and that the discussion included only "passing references to Maxwell." Resp. at 89 
1.39. The government bases this argument exclusively on a phone call prosecutors conducted 
with AUSA 
on February 11, 2021, five years after the February 29 meeting actually took 
place. Ex. K. This Court should reject the government's revisionist history. 
The best evidence of what happened on February 29, 2016—at least the best evidence the 
government has produced so far—is AUSA 
contemporaneous notes.8 Ex. J.; Abdel! v. 
City of New York, No. 05 CIV. 8453 KMK JCF, 2006 WL 2664313, at •7 
Sept. 14, 
2006) (denying motion to quash third-party subpoena because "contemporaneous statements of 
witnesses constitute best evidence"). Although the government attached these notes to its 
Response, Resp. Ex. 5, the government does not rely on them as part of its argument, choosing 
instead to rely on AUSA 
1.39, 92 (citing Ex. 4). 
2021 recollection of what happened, Resp. at 62-66, 89 & 
s It appears the government does not actually want to know anything beyond what AUSA 
remembers (or doesn't remember) of 2016. All the government did in response to Maxwell's Motion was 
telephone AUSA 
. The government apparently: (1) did not search its system for any and all emails 
from, to, or about David Boies, Sigrid McCawle , Stan Pottinger, Brad Edwards, or Peter Skinner; and 
(2) did not interview anyone other than AUSA 
such as the other attendees of the meeting 
(Pottinger, Edwards, and Skinner), or any of the other AUSAs whom AUSA 
talked to about her 
contacts with 
attorneys. 
Most conspicuous, of course, is the government's failure to interview AUSA 
or secure 
an affidavit from him. If this Court does not grant Maxwell's Motion on the papers, only an evidentiary 
hearing can address these issues. 
EFTA00029112
--- PAGE 14 ---
But in her 2021 interview, AUSA 
mostly disclaimed a memory of what happened 
in 2016. Ex. K. The phrases "does not recall," "does not remember," or some similar expression 
of lack of memory appear at least thirty-two times in the notes of the government's 2021 call 
with AUSA 
Id. 
Many of AUSA 
disclaimers, however, are simply not credible. For example, 
AUSA 
claimed not to "have an independent memory of the 
v. Maxwell 
[defamation] lawsuit being mentioned" during the meeting, id. at I, even though her notes are 
replete with references to the lawsuit, Ex. J. After reviewing her notes, AUSA 
denied 
that they refreshed her memory. Ex. K, p I. 
AUSA 
similarly denied remembering whether 
attorneys ever provided 
her with documents, id. at 6, despite the email from Peter Skinner just hours after the February 
meeting providing AUSA 
with numerous documents, Ex. L, p 1-2, and despite the 
fact that AUSA 
in 2018 personally delivered those documents to AUSA 
AUSA Kurland, and one member of the prosecution team in this case, Ex. I, p 1 (12/6/2018 
Email to AUSA 
"Just went through my files and found a folder w/ the notes I took 
and the documents they brought me. Want to come by?"). 
When AUSA 
did claim to remember what transpired, her memory was often 
inconsistent with the contemporaneous evidence. Take just one example. "To [her] knowledge," 
AUSA 
said, she did "not receive[] any discovery materials from any civil case." Ex. K, p 
6. That is not correct. The government admits that AUSA 
received from 
attorneys, and turned over to AUSA 
and others in the office, including flight records 
and Palm Beach Police Department Records. Resp. at 66 & 1.2. Both of these documents were 
produced in discovery in the civil case. 
EFTA00029113
--- PAGE 15 ---
From any perspective, therefore, AUSA 
2021 version of events is not worthy of 
credence, nor is the government's Response to Maxwell's Motion, which adopts AUSA 
version of events (to the extent she claims to remember them) while ignoring the 
contemporaneous evidence of what actually happened. The record is surpassingly clear: In 
February 2016 and the weeks and months after, 
attorneys "pitched" a prosecution of 
Maxwell and Epstein.' 
• 
Defense 2: The government was not asked to consider a perjury charge 
against Maxwell. 
Noting that the February 29, 2016 meeting occurred before Maxwell's two depositions 
(April and July 2016), the government insists that 
attorneys did not ask (indeed could 
not have asked) the government to consider charging Maxwell with perjury. Resp. at 63. Again, 
the documentary evidence belies this claim. 
First, AUSA 
contemporaneous notes say that a 
wants prosecution." Ex. 
J, p 7. AUSA 
knew what 
attorneys were after, which is why she emailed the 
Chief of the Criminal Division just days after the meeting to discuss the "intriguing" case, Ex. 
M. 
Second, in the 2021 interview with prosecutors, AUSA 
did not deny that 
attorneys asked her to consider a perjury prosecution. Ex. K, p 5. Instead, AUSA 
said that she "does not remember one way or the other if any of the attorneys referenced 
the possibility of perjury." Id. 
There are other indications as well that 
attorneys pressed AUSA 
to investigate 
Maxwell. For example, while AUSA 
notes say Jean Luc Brunel "is wanting to cooperate," Ex. 
J, p 2, they say nothing of the sort about Maxwell, instead describing her as Epstein's "head recruiter," id. 
See also Ex. O. 
I0 
EFTA00029114
--- PAGE 16 ---
Third, in the same interview, AUSA 
admitted that she contemplated a perjury 
prosecution, and she "recalls thinking that a perjury investigation would have ... challenges." 
Ex. K, p 5. Left unexplained by the government in its Response to Maxwell's Motion is why 
AUSA 
would have contemplated a perjury prosecution if 
attorneys had not 
proposed one. 
There are two possible explanations. Either (1) 
attorneys knew in February 
2016 that they were going to set a perjury trap for Maxwell, and they discussed that plan with 
AUSA 
at the time, or (2) there were additional communications between AUSA 
and 
attorneys (phone calls or even a second meeting) after Maxwell was deposed. 
Either way, the government contemplated a perjury charge against Maxwell in 2016, and the 
Response's insistence otherwise is not credible. 
• 
Defense 3: Maxwell's argument relies on nothing but the Daily News 
article. 
The government says that Maxwell's argument "is premised solely on her use of selective 
snippets from a lone Daily News Article that is premised, in meaningful part, on anonymous 
sources and hearsay." Resp. at 89. This claim is stunningly disingenuous, and it fails on its own 
terms. 
When Maxwell filed her Motion, she did not have access to the government's emails and 
AUSA 
contemporaneous notes, despite their obvious exculpatory value. See Brady v. 
Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87-88 (1963). The government did not disclose these materials until 
Maxwell challenged the government's candor and conduct before Judge McMahon. One 
wonders whether the government would have provided them to Maxwell had she not filed this 
Motion. 
EFTA00029115
--- PAGE 17 ---
The government's claim also fails on its own terms. The article is not meaningfully 
anonymous.10 Among others, the article quotes David Boies, who said: 
We were saying to anyone who would listen: We've got clients who were abused. 
Some of them were underage. We have the evidence. There's a whole record that's 
been developed. We can establish beyond any reasonable doubt there was a massive 
sex trafficking ring going on. 
The article also quotes Brad Edwards, who describes in his self-published memoir the various 
contacts 
attorneys had with the U.S. Attorney's Office in 2016. 
Finally, as detailed above, AUSA 
contemporaneous notes confirm most of the 
article's substance." Ex. J. 
• 
Defense 4: There was only one meeting. 
The government denies there was a second meeting between the U.S. Attorney's Office 
and 
attorneys. Resp. at 92. This denial, though, is based solely on AUSA 
foggy memory and in the absence of any credible investigation. Contrary to the government's 
claim, the evidence strongly suggests there was a second meeting or some further contact 
between them. At the very least, this Court should hold an evidentiary hearing to find the truth.

To the extent the article relies on unnamed sources, there is no indication those sources are 
anonymous in the sense that the author is unaware of their identity. In the 2021 call, the government 
apparently did not ask AUSA 
whether she was one of the unnamed sources. See Ex. K. 
The government also says the article is hearsay. Resp. at 89. This is an odd claim for the 
government to make while asking this Court to credit double hearsay: someone's notes of statements 
made by AUSA 
during a phone call. The government's hearsay argument does nothing but 
support Maxwell's request for an evidentiary hearing. 
EFTA00029116
--- PAGE 18 ---
Two of the sources in the Daily News article insisted there was a second meeting in the 
summer of 2016.12
In addition, as described above, AUSA 
in 2021 said she recalls contemplating a 
perjury prosecution of Maxwell. Ex. K, p 5. But if there were only the one meeting, it makes 
little sense for AUSA 
to have been thinking about a potential perjury prosecution in 
February of 2016, before Maxwell had even been deposed (unless the plan was to set a perjury 
trap for Maxwell). It is more likely that AUSA 
contemplated a perjury prosecution after 
a second meeting with 
attorneys, which took place after at least one of Maxwell's 
depositions. As reported in the Daily News, "David [Boles] was particularly frustrated by the 
failure to pursue a perjury charge.s13 "We have her dead to rights," he said.14
This Court cannot accept without further inquiry the government's assertion that there 
wasn't a second meeting or any further contact between the U.S. Attorney's Office and 
attorneys. At a minimum, an evidentiary hearing is required. 
• 
Defense 5: AUSA 
had no idea what was in Boles Schiller's files. 
The government stands by the claim that AUSA 
had "either little or no 
additional information than [Judge McMahon did] in terms of what materials there are [and] who 
was deposed" and, for all the government knew, the deposition transcripts would show "page 
after page of people taking the Fifth." See Resp. at 70. The government's Response is not 
credible.

EFTA00029117
--- PAGE 19 ---
For one thing, the government admits that 
attorneys turned over several 
documents in 2016, which were in the government's possession when AUSA 
claimed 
to Judge McMahon that he did not know what was in Boies Schiller's file. Moreover, by the time 
AUSA 
told Judge McMahon that, for all he knew, the deposition transcripts would 
show "page after page of people taking the Fifth," it was already a matter of public record that 
Maxwell had been deposed and that she had not invoked the Fifth Amendment. Ex. Q, p 1. 
The government's argument also defies logic. The government was asking Judge 
McMahon to authorize a subpoena of Boies Schiller's entire file. At a minimum, the government 
had to have asked Boies Schiller about the size of the file and issues related to privilege to 
determine if Boies Schiller would contest the subpoena or notify either the civil court or 
Maxwell when the subpoena was issued and responsive documents produced. In fact, the 
government issued two subpoenas to Boies Schiller: the first for material covered by the 
Protective Order, and the second for material outside the Protective Order's reach. Clearly, the 
government knew more about Boies Schiller's file than AUSA 
let on. 
• 
Defense 6: The "subject of your investigation" to whom Judge McMahon 
referred was Jeffrey Epstein. 
According to the government, when Judge McMahon asked AUSA 
"about 
contacts between the United States Attorney's Office and the Boies Schiller firm prior to the 
issuance of the subpoena on the subject of your investigation," Mot. Ex. E, p 2, Judge McMahon 
was referring only to Epstein. Resp. at 71. This is not a plausible reading of the transcript. 
After his first appearance before her, Judge McMahon haled AUSA 
back to 
court for one reason. "I'll be very up-front with you," she said. Mot. Ex. E, p 2. 
EFTA00029118
--- PAGE 20 ---
I want to make sure I'm not in a Chemical Battk[15] kind of situation, so I would 
like to know about contacts between the United States Attorney's Office and the 
Boies Schiller firm prior to the issuance of the subpoena on the subject of your 
investigation. 
Id. (emphasis added). 
"Tellingly,"16 Judge McMahon did not ask AUSA 
about the "target" of his 
investigation; she asked about its "subject." The "subject of [the] investigation" is much broader 
than its "target." 
"A `target' is a person as to whom the prosecutor or the grand jury has substantial 
evidence linking him or her to the commission of a crime and who, in the judgment of the 
prosecutor, is a putative defendant.' "A `subject' of an investigation is a person whose conduct 
is within the scope of the grand jury's investigation." The scope of an investigation, in turn, 
includes not only potential defendants and potential victims, but also the conduct at issue and the 
locations involved. 
Were there any doubt about Judge McMahon's meaning, she put that doubt to rest in her 
written order authorizing the subpoena. Mot. Ex. G, p 21. The "subject of the investigation," she 
explained, was "the matters that were the subject of the 
[defamation] Action." Id. And 
having asked AUSA 
about his office's contacts with Boies Schiller about "the 
Chemical Bank v. Affiliated FM Ins. Co., 154 F.R.D. 91 (. 
1994). 
"Tellingly," claims the government in the Response, "Maxwell omits [the phrase 'subject of 
your investigation'] of this question from her motion." Resp. at 70 1.34. Not true. On page 13 of 
Maxwell's Motion, in arguing that AUSA 
mislead Judge McMahon, Maxwell fully and 
completely quotes Judge McMahon's question, just as she does above. Mot. at 13 (quoting Ex. E, p 2).

matters that were the subject of the 
[defamation] Action," and having been misled by 
AUSA 
response, Judge McMahon erroneously (though blamelessly) concluded that 
lijothing in this record suggests to me that 
or Boies Schiller had anything 
to do with the Government's decision to convene a grand jury to look into the 
matters that were the subject of the 
Action. . . There is no evidence of 
"collusion," to invoke a term of the moment, and it is quite clear that Boies Schiller 
did not foment the Government's investigation. 
/d. (emphasis added). 
For her part, AUSA 
shared the very concern Judge McMahon later expressed to 
AUSA 
that Boies Schiller was trying to instigate an investigation of Maxwell to 
leverage its position in the "MN Action." Mot. Ex. K, p 3. In the 2021 call, AUSA 
recalled that the 
pending CVRA civil case and other civil litigation . . . gave [her] some pause 
because she had other occasions where civil litigants have decided to report 
something to the USAO because they think it will help them in their civil case. 
AUSA 
even mentioned this concern to the Chief of the Criminal Division. Id. If AUSA 
and the Chief of the Criminal Division recognized what was going on, AUSA 
can hardly feign ignorance.19
If the government means to suggest that when Judge McMahon asked about any prior 
contacts concerning "the subject of your investigation," she was somehow confining her inquiry 
to the time period surrounding November 2018, see Resp. at 90-91, that too is an implausible 
reading of the transcript. If Judge McMahon meant "subject" to be a term of art ("subject" of the 
investigation as opposed to a "target" of the investigation), then the government should have 
Of course, if AUSA 
honestly did not understand Chief Judge McMahon's uestion, 
once she issued her opinion there could no longer be any doubt. And at that point, AUSA 
would have been duty-bound to correct the misimpression he had created. M. Rules of Professional 
Conduct, Rule. 3.8, cmt. [6A] ("Like other lawyers, prosecutors are subject to Rule 3.3, which requires a 
lawyer to take reasonable remedial measures to correct material evidence that the lawyer has offered 
when the lawyer comes to know of its falsity."). 
EFTA00029120
--- PAGE 22 ---
disclosed the Boies Schiller contacts for the reasons given above. And if Judge McMahon meant 
"subject" to have its everyday meaning, then she was asking about something even broader: 
Whether the U.S. Attorney's Office had contacts with Boies Schiller about the "subject"—i.e., 
the "conduct"—being investigated. 
Nothing about the transcript supports the government's overly narrow, hindsight-based 
interpretation of Judge McMahon's question. 
* * * 
For these reasons, this Court should reject the government's attempt to rewrite the history 
of its investigation and its affirmative misrepresentations to Judge McMahon. 
B. Assuming the Government's Defenses Are Worthy of Belief, the 
Government Still Misled the Court. 
Even if the government's account were worthy of belief (which it is not), that doesn't get 
the government off the hook. 
The government would like this Court to believe that: (1) the February 29 meeting 
concerned a prosecution of Epstein only and not Maxwell; and (2) when Judge McMahon asked 
AUSA 
about his office's prior contacts with Boies Schiller concerning "the subject of 
its investigation," Judge McMahon was referring to Epstein only and not Maxwell. 
Even if those two assertions were true, however, then AUSA 
still misled 
Judge McMahon and misrepresented the origins of the investigation. Under the government's 
version of events, "the pitch was to investigate Epstein, not Maxwell." Resp. at 89 1.39. If that's 
true, AUSA 
unquestionably should have told Judge McMahon about the February 
2016 meeting when she asked him "about contacts between the United States Attorney's Office 
and the Boies Schiller firm prior to the issuance of the subpoena on the subject of your 
investigation"—i.e., Epstein. AUSA 
did not tell Chief Judge McMahon about the 
EFTA00029121
--- PAGE 23 ---
contacts with Boies Schiller on the topic of Epstein any more than he shared the contacts on the 
topic of Maxwell—he simply denied any contacts had occurred, something that is demonstrably 
false. 
Whether Boies Schiller "pitched" a prosecution of Epstein only or of Epstein and 
Maxwell as a duo, AUSA 
misled Judge McMahon by denying there was any "pitch" 
whatsoever. 
III. The Materiality of the Government's False Statements. 
The government halfheartedly suggests that "there is no reason to believe that a 
description of the February 2016 meeting would have been material to Chief Judge McMahon's 
analysis of whether she was facing a `Chemical Bank kind of situation.' Resp. at 91. Hardly. In 
fact, there is every reason to believe Judge McMahon would have refused to authorize the 
subpoena if AUSA 
had not so misled her. 
How do we know? Because Judge McMahon said so—at least twice. 
Judge McMahon first made this clear by haling AUSA 
back in for one and 
only one reason: To ask him about the contacts between Boies Schiller and his office before 
November 2018. So crucial was this question to Judge McMahon's decision that the transcript of 
the AUSA 
second appearance before her is just three pages long. Mot. Ex. E. 
Judge McMahon made her thinking even clearer in her written order authorizing the 
subpoena. Mot. Ex. G. On page 12 of her opinion, when attempting to reconcile Chemical Bank 
with Martindell,2° Judge McMahon found that "nothing in the record suggests that the 
Government's investigation in this case was occasioned by Boies Schiller—a point to which I 
will return later in this opinion." Mot. Ex. G, p 12. 
Martindell v. Intl Tel. & Tel. Corp., 594 F.2d 291 (2d Cir. 1979). 
EFTA00029122
--- PAGE 24 ---
Judge McMahon "returned" to that point when discussing whether Maxwell could have 
reasonably relied on the Protective Order: 
[T]heaihing on which Maxwell or anyone else might reasonably have relied is 
that 
or her lawyers would not do what the defendant in Chemical Bank 
did—that is, forward discovery materials in their possession to prosecutors for the 
purpose of fomenting an investigation. But I am not faced with that situation. 
Nothing in this record suggests to me that 
or Boies Schiller had anything to 
do with the Government's decision to convene a grand jury to look into the matters 
that were the subject of the 
Action. On the contrary—the Government has 
advised the Court that it contacted Boies Schiller as part of its search for parties 
who might have been victims in its investigation; and that Boies Schiller told the 
Government that it could not consensually produce at least some documents in its 
files because of the existence of the Protective Order. There is no evidence of 
"collusion," to invoke a term of the moment, and it is quite clear that Boies Schiller 
did not foment the Government's investigation. Moreover, the Assistant United 
States Attorney has represented to this Court that he has no idea what is in Boies 
Schiller's files, and that for all he knows every witness who was deposed stood on 
his/her Fifth Amendment rights and refused to answer questions. 
Id. at 21. 
Contrary to Judge McMahon's understanding, Boies Schiller contacted the government 
(not the other way around); there was ample evidence of "collusion"; it was "quite clear that 
Boies Schiller did . . . foment the Government's investigation"; and AUSA 
knew 
much more about what was in Boies Schiller's files than he let on. 
The Chemical Bank situation Judge McMahon was worried about— when civil litigant 
attempts to foment a criminal investigation of her opponent—is exactly what occurred. 
Judge McMahon cannot be faulted for not knowing all the facts. AUSA 
on 
the other hand, had a "complete handle on the landscape," and he withheld the truth from Judge 
McMahon. Had AUSA 
not misled her, it is clear Judge McMahon would not have 
authorized the subpoena.' 
It's notable that even without the benefit of truth from AUSA 
Judge McMahon 
wrongly concluded that Maxwell could not have reasonably relied on the Protective Order. In fact, the

IV. The Remedy for the Government's Misconduct. 
A. Pursuant to its Inherent Power, this Court Should Suppress the Evidence 
Obtained from Boies Schiller and Dismiss Counts Five and Six, which are 
the Fruits of that Evidence. 
This Court has inherent authority to regulate the administration of criminal justice among 
the parties. McNabb v. United States, 318 U.S. 332, 340 (1943). "Judges have an obligation to 
exercise supervision over the administration of criminal justice in federal courts, a responsibility 
that 'implies the duty of establishing and maintaining civilized standards of procedure and 
evidence.'" United States v. Ming He, 94 F.3d 782, 789 (2d Cir. 1996) (quoting McNabb, 318 
U.S. at 340). As the Supreme Court held in United States v. Payner, "Federal courts may use 
their supervisory power in some circumstances to exclude evidence taken from the defendant by 
'willful disobedience of law."' 447 U.S. 727, 735 (1980) (quoting McNabb, 318 U.S. at 345) 
(citing Elkins v. United States, 364 U.S. 206, 223 (1960); Rea v. United States, 350 U.S. 214, 
216-17 (1956); Hampton v. United States, 425 U.S. 484, 495 (1976) (Powell, J., concurring in 
judgment)). A court should invoke its supervisory power of suppression when "there has been a 
fraud upon the court in addition to a violation of the defendant's rights." United States v. 
Cortina, 630 F.2d 1207, 1216 (7th Cir. 1980). 
In United States v. Cortina, a magistrate issued a search warrant based upon an affidavit 
subscribed by FBI Agent Linda Stewart, which itself was based on the reports and investigation 
of FBI Agent William Brown. Id. at 1208. Unbeknownst to Agent Stewart, Agent Brown's 
Second Circuit in Brown v. Maxwell held a few months after Judge McMahon's ruling that Maxwell had 
reasonably relied on the Protective Order's guarantee of confidentiality in substantial part, and it therefore 
redacted sua sponte from the summary judgment material those "deposition responses concerning 
intimate matters where the questions were likely only permitted—and the responses only compelled—
because of a strong expectation of continued confidentiality. 929 F.3d 4, 48, 122 (2d Cir. 2019) (citing 
Fed. R. Civ. P. 5.2). So, too, has Judge Preska redacted substantial material from the documents she has 
released on remand from the Second Circuit, again reflecting that Maxwell reasonably relied on the 
Protective Order. 
EFTA00029124
--- PAGE 26 ---
reports were replete with misrepresentations and outright lies about the conversations he had 
with, and information provided by, a confidential informant. Id. at 1212-13. The Court of 
Appeals affirmed the district court's order suppressing the evidence obtained from the search 
conducted under the warrant. Id. at 1213. "This search," said the Court, "never should have taken 
place." Id. 
The Court offered two bases for its decision. It first invoked the Franks analysis to affirm 
the district court's conclusion that Agent Brown intentionally or recklessly misrepresented 
material information in Agent Stewart's affidavit. Id. But the Court went further, concluding that 
suppression was independently required as a matter of inherent authority. Id. at 1214-17. 
Because Agent Brown lied in the affidavit (in addition to lying at the Franks hearing), "[t]he call 
for the court's supervisory power under then circumstances is at its strongest and most 
defensible." Id. at 1214. 
The Court recognized that the inherent authority doctrine is not a free pass for courts to 
suppress evidence or "merely [to] disagree with the method[s] of law enforcement." Id. "[T]he 
federal supervisory power does not give `the federal judiciary a `chancellor's foot' veto over law 
enforcement practices of which it (does) not approve.'" Id. (quoting United States v. Russell, 411 
U.S. 423,435 (1973)). Even so, inherent authority is properly invoked to "prevent[] the court 
from condoning a fraud perpetrated upon it." Id. Suppression serves both to deter unlawful 
governmental conduct and to protect judicial integrity. Id. (weighing "the deterrent values of 
preventing the incrimination of those whose rights the police have violated ... and the need to 
protect the integrity of the federal courts against the cost to society of excluding `probative but 
tainted evidence"). 
EFTA00029125
--- PAGE 27 ---
Maxwell had a due process right to notice and an opportunity to be heard on the 
government's request to modify the Protective Order and issue a subpoena to Boies Schiller. 
Mot. Ex. A, 1 14 (permitting modification of the Protective Order only "for good cause shown 
following notice to all parties and an opportunity to be heard"); Mot. Ex. H (Judge Netbum 
denying the government's ex parte request to modify the Jane Doe 43 Protective Order in part 
because the government was attempting to deprive Maxwell of notice and an opportunity to be 
heard); Martindell, 594 F.2d at 294; see U.S. CONST. amend. V. Maxwell also had a privacy 
interest in the materials subject to the subpoena, including most especially her deposition 
transcripts. Mot. Ex. A (defining "confidential" material as that which "implicates common law 
and statutory privacy interests of ... Ghislaine Maxwell"); see U.S. CONST. amend. IV. The 
government violated these rights when it secured an ex pane modification of the Protective 
Order based on materially false statements to Judge McMahon. In resisting any sanction for its 
misconduct, and in denying that Maxwell should even be afforded a hearing, the government 
asks this Court to "condon[e] a fraud perpetrated upon it." See Cortina, 630 F.2d at 1214. 
To be sure, AUSA 
misled Judge McMahon in answering the singular question 
she posed, and he did so with full knowledge of the facts. AUSA 
misrepresentations 
were material to Judge McMahon's decision, because she would not have modified the 
Protective Order if AUSA 
had been candid about Boies Schiller's role in initiating 
the investigation. As Judge McMahon put it, "the only thing on which Maxwell... might 
reasonably have relied is that 
or her lawyers" would not approach prosecutors and 
"foment the Government's investigation." Mot. Ex. G, p 21. I. That is, in fact, exactly what 
happened. As in Cortina, the modification of the Protective Order "never should have taken 
place." Id. When, as here, a prosecutor—from the public corruption unit no less-misrepresents 
EFTA00029126
--- PAGE 28 ---
material information to a federal judge in an ex parte proceeding, "[t]he call for the court's 
supervisory power ... is at its strongest and most defensible." Cortina, 630 F.2d at 1214. 
Maxwell need not satisfy the standard of Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978) in 
order to obtain relief. But even if Franks applies, Maxwell has easily met her burden. To obtain a 
Franks hearing, a defendant must make a "substantial preliminary showing," United States v. 
Falso, 544 F.3d 110, 125 (2d Cir. 2008) (quoting Franks, 438 U.S. at 155-56), that (i) there were 
"inaccuracies or omissions" in the affidavit, (ii) "the alleged falsehoods or omissions were 
necessary to the issuing judge's probable cause or necessity finding," and (iii) "the claimed 
inaccuracies or omissions [were] the result of the affiant's deliberate falsehood or reckless 
disregard for the truth." United States v. Lambus, 897 F.3d 368, 397 (2d Cir. 2018). Here, there 
is no dispute that (i) AUSA 
representations to Judge McMahon were false and 
misleading, (ii) Judge McMahon would not have modified the Protective Order to authorize the 
subpoena if AUSA 
had been honest with her, and (3) AUSA 
statements 
were deliberately false, since he had a "complete handle on the landscape" months before he 
appeared in front of and misled Judge McMahon. 
Nor need Maxwell prove "outrageous government conduct" to obtain relief. Were that 
her burden, however, Maxwell would have easily satisfied it. "The concept of fairness embodied 
in the Fifth Amendment due process guarantee is violated by government action that is 
fundamentally unfair or shocking to our traditional sense of justice." United States v. Schmidt, 
105 F.3d 82, 91 (2d Cir. 1997). To prevail on an outrageous government conduct claim, "a 
defendant must show that the government's conduct is `so outrageous that common notions of 
fairness and decency would be offended were judicial processes invoked to obtain a 
EFTA00029127
--- PAGE 29 ---
conviction.'" United States v. Bout, 731 F.3d 233, 238 (2d Cir. 2013) (quoting United States v. 
Schmidt, 105 F.3d 82, 91 (2d Cir. 1997)). 
Here, it would "shock the conscience" to permit a prosecutor to make false statements to 
a federal judge to circumvent another judge's duly-entered order, all in violation of the 
defendant's due process, privacy, and Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights. The only way to 
prevent Maxwell from suffering unconstitutional prejudice because of the government's 
misconduct is to suppress the evidence the government unlawfully obtained and to dismiss 
Counts 5 and 6. 
* * * 
AUSA 
breached two separate but equally consequential duties: The duty of a 
public prosecutor and the duty of candor. 
"[T]he responsibility of a public prosecutor differs from that of the usual advocate; his 
duty is to seek justice, not merely to convict." Young v. United States, 481 U.S. 787, 803 (1987). 
Prosecutors are held to a higher standard, and for good reason. "[The prosecutor] is in a peculiar 
and very definite sense the servant of the law, the twofold aim of which is that guilt shall not 
escape or innocence suffer." Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 88 (1935). 
Moreover, "[i]l light of the prosecutor's public responsibilities, broad authority and 
discretion, the prosecutor has a heightened duty of candor to the courts and in fulfilling other 
professional obligations." ABA Criminal Justice Standards, Prosecution Function, Standard 3-
1.4 (4th ed. 2017). "While all lawyers owe a duty of honesty and candor to the Court, `this 
obligation lies most heavily upon [public prosecutors] who are not merely partisan advocates, but 
public officials charged with administering justice honestly, fairly and impartially." Morales v. 
Portuondo, 165 F. Supp. 2d 601, 612 
2001). 
EFTA00029128
--- PAGE 30 ---
In turn, this already high standard ratchets up even higher when a prosecutor appears 
before the court ex parte. "The duty of candor is, if anything, more critical when ex parte 
applications are made to a court." hr re WinNet R CJSC, 2017 WL 1373918, at *9 
No. 
16MC484(DLC), Apr. 13, 2017); see 
. Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 3.3(d) ("In an ex 
pane proceeding, a lawyer shall inform the tribunal of all material facts known to the lawyer that 
will enable the tribunal to make an informed decision, whether or not the facts are adverse."); see 
also id. cmt. [14]. And it "is not a defense to claim that, while factual statements to the Court 
were materially misleading, they were not literally false. Attorneys are officers of the Court, and 
our system of justice cannot operate efficiently if the Court cannot rely on the candor of counsel 
presenting an application for ex parte relief." Four Star Fin. Servs., LLC v. Commonwealth 
Mgmt. Assocs., 166 F. Supp. 2d 805, 810 
2001). 
AUSA 
failed to live up to these standards. In an ex parte proceeding, AUSA 
affirmatively misled Judge McMahon, with full knowledge of what issue concerned 
Judge McMahon and what information would be material to her decision. When, as here, "there 
has been a fraud upon the court," Cortina, 630 F.2d at 1216, "[t]he court has inherent authority 
to regulate the administration of criminal justice among the parties before the bar .... [by] 
exclud[ing] evidence taken from the defendant by willful disobedience of law," id. at 1214. 
United States v. Lambus, 897 F.3d 368, 386 (2d Cir. 2018) ("It is within the court's inherent 
authority to suppress evidence gathered unlawfully in order to maintain the integrity of its own 
proceedings...."). 
EFTA00029129
--- PAGE 31 ---
B. At a Minimum, this Court Should Order a Hearing at which Maxwell 
May Inquire into the Circumstances Surrounding the Government's 
Misrepresentation to Judge McMahon. 
"An evidentiary hearing is normally required to address motions to suppress where a 
factual issue is in dispute." United States v. Paredes-Cordova, No. SI 03 CR. 987DAB, 2009 
WL 1585776, at *1 
June 8, 2009); United States v. Pena, 961 F.2d 333, 339 (2d Cir. 
1992) ("[All evidentiary hearing on a motion to suppress ordinarily is required if the moving 
papers are sufficiently definite, specific, detailed, and nonconjectural to enable the court to 
conclude that contested issues of fact going to the validity of the search are in question." 
(quotation omitted))). Here, the government has confessed enough facts to demonstrate that 
Maxwell at least is entitled to a hearing. 
There is no merit to the government's assertion that Maxwell is not entitled to a hearing 
because she has not submitted an affidavit in support of her Motion. An affidavit is not a 
prerequisite to a hearing when the government has confessed the existence of facts sufficient to 
entitle a defendant to an evidentiary hearing. 
Nor is an affidavit required when information at issue is peculiarly within the possession 
of the government (e.g., AUSA 
and AUSA a 
or others who are adverse to 
Maxwell (e.g., Boies, Edwards, Skinner, Pottinger). See Cortina, 630 F.2d at 1216 ("The 
violation here is particularly insidious because it is difficult to uncover misrepresentations in an 
[ex parte submission]. The information needed to prove such assertions false is peculiarly within 
the hands of the government."). Since Maxwell was not at the February 29 meeting or copied on 
any of the emails or communications that followed, the Response does not explain how Maxwell 
could possibly submit an affidavit attesting to the government's misrepresentations based on 
personal knowledge. 
EFTA00029130
--- PAGE 32 ---
The government of course does not suggest that any of its agents, such as AUSA 
would be willing to provide an affidavit to Maxwell or otherwise speak with defense 
counsel absent compulsion from this Court. Indeed, the government conspicuously did not attach 
to its Response any affidavits about its interactions with Boies Schiller. 
It's plain, therefore, that this Court should hold an evidentiary hearing and effectuate 
Maxwell's constitutional right to compulsory process because that is the only way to get to the 
truth.22
Conclusion 
For these reasons, as well as those given in the Motion, this Court should: (1) suppress all 
evidence the government obtained from Boies Schiller and any other evidence derived 
therefrom; or (2) suppress the April and July 2016 depositions and all evidence derived 
therefrom; and (3) dismiss Counts Five and Six. Maxwell requests an evidentiary hearing on this 
Motion. 
Dated: March 15, 2021 
If this Court concludes an affidavit is required before it holds a hearing, Maxwell requests 
leave, as she did in her Motion, to attempt to obtain such an affidavit. But if, as is likely, none of the 
participants—e.g., AUSA 
, AUSA 
Boies, Edwards, Skinner, Pottinger—voluntarily 
provides an affidavit, Maxwell invokes her constitutional right to compulsory process and this Court's 
authority to compel testimony in support of her defense. U.S. CONST. amend. VI.

Thanks for reaching out. We probably are best served by sending you our position on defense disclosures by email. We 
should be able to send that by Friday and can schedule a time to talk thereafter if you wish, with an eye towards the joint 
filing on Monday. 
We will confer with the team on the Speedy Trial issue and also get back to you on that. 
Lastly, do you want to discuss anything regarding Mr. Manley's application to the Court? I believe we are to discuss and 
then you are to write the Court by Friday. I am free tomorrow afternoon to discuss if you wish. 
Thanks,

Subject: US v. Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) - meet and confer 
Counsel, 
Per Judge Nathan's Order (docket number 250), is there a time this week when you would be available for a call to meet 
and confer regarding a proposed schedule for defense disclosure of witness statements pursuant to Rule 26.2? Or if you 
would prefer to confer by email, would you please let us know your position? 
Additionally, we intend to submit a letter to Judge Nathan requesting that time under the Speedy Trial Act be excluded 
through the date the Court intends to set for trial of Counts One through Six of the S2 Indictment. Although Judge Nathan 
previously excluded time through July 12, 2021, she has not reissued such an order since the return of the 52 Indictment, 
and, of course, the date of trial may change. We therefore intend to seek a clarifying order excluding time, both in light of 
the still-pending suppression motion, which automatically excludes time, and in the interests of justice to allow for trial 
preparation. Would you please let us know whether you consent to the exclusion? 
Thank you, 
Assistant United States Attorney 
Southern District of New York

Chiefs, 
Thanks very much for talking this morning. As discussed, attached is a draft application for an amended search warrant 
correcting the FBI barcode numbers for 3 devices that were seized from Epstein's NY residence. In case it's useful, I'm also 
attaching the exhibits that are referenced in the draft application.

The most recent one I have is for Maxwell, attached — you may want to just check the forms library to see if there has 
been any update since this version (2019.07.24), but I assume it's up to date since it's just from the summer. 
From a little further back, but possibly simpler, also attached is one I got for a PAC case to make arrests. 
Good luck!!

Thanks! And really, no problem at all. I'm going to be on leave for the next two weeks, so I probably won't send your

Got it, thank you. I'm so sorry for the delay in feedback. I did a quick scan a while back and thought it looked great, but 
will do a closer read and get any comments to you by the end of next week (and you can blame me if you raise them with 
the PC Chiefs!). Thanks for all of your great and hard work on this case. 
P.S. Do you know

I hope all's well! Draft RTC in Maxwell attached. The team is going to have comments, I'm sure, as will the chiefs. If you

Hi all, 
Attached is a draft RTC for your review. I've left in some comment bubbles to flag some of the judgment calls, and I'm 
going to clean up the cites/do a citecheck. 
Looking forward to your comments.

process of turning our edits to the combined memo. So it will probably make sense to set a time to talk through the 
issues next week. 
Also, we wanted to update you that the team was contacted by trustees' counsel recently, who conveyed that the estate 
is beginning to take steps to sell illiquid assets, including NY and other properties, in order to meet its July 15 tax 
deadline. The estate apparently tried to get the IRS to hold off on the tax enforcement until it settles a number of 
contingent liabilities, but the IRS will not agree. The attorneys said they would be willing to discuss some way to 
maintain our forfeiture interest in a relevant amount. Consistent with prior directions, the team did not respond / 
engage on the issue, but we wanted to update you on this. We can add it to the list of items to discuss next week.

I have uploaded the documents I was able to find in the Epstein Account Document Folder in DOJ USA File Exchange site. 
You should already have access to that folder. 
I also came across two documents requesting removal for Ghislaine Maxwell from the Hyperion Air, Jeffery Epstein and 
JEGE accounts, I have already provided those accounts documents. I also came across a memo requesting removal of 
Ghislaine Maxwell from NES LLC Account tt 
. I was unable to come across documents for that account. Those 
removal memos have been placed in the Epstein Accounts Document folder as well. 
If you have any questions, please call me.

I've gone back through the memo and softened/modified a number of my comments. Do you want to hold off on sending 
back to the team until 
reaches out? Since we're not telling them to cut the 
section (yet), I would be inclined 
to send this back now so they can start working through our comments, and then 
can reach out later today? I also 
think it would be helpful both to morale and to getting 
up to speed to have • review the memo as drafted before 
telling them to cut the •

What 302s does she come up in other than 
and 
and what is the context? 
From: 
(USANYS)
Sent: Sunday, August 2, 2020 2:03 PM 
To: 
(USANYS) 
Subject: RE: 
One of the difficulties in answering this question is that we don't have the pros memo. Here's what I've been able to 
learn from what we do have: 
We do have the transcripts of their grand jury testimony (although not the AUSA preamble). She is not mentioned in the 
introductory part of the agent's testimony where they are walking through the various targets and subjects of the 
investigation. By contrast, Epstein, _-and 
-re (pp. 5-6). In fact, she only comes up once in the 
entire grand jury presentation, namely in the context of the agent's summary of how 
met Epstein. 
Specifically, the agent testifies as follows: 
I'm sorry, the question you asked me was: How did they meet? They met by a friend of Mr. Epstein's. Jane Doe 
Number One was working at Mar-a-Lago and a friend of Mr. Epstein's, Ghislaine Maxwell. 
Would you like the spelling? 
THE REPORTER: Yes, please. 
THE WITNESS: G-H-I-S-L-A-I-N-E, Maxwell, who was a friend of Mr. Epstein, met Jane Doe Number One at 
Mar-a-Lago and Jane Doe Number One soon after began working and providing massages for Mr. Epstein 
The fact that she has to spell it strongly suggests the name also didn't come up during whatever preamble the AUSA 
provided. But either way, that's it. 
As you know, she is not mentioned in the NPA and, according the lawyer at OPR who is running the NPA investigation, 
Maxwell does not come up much, if at all, in the documents they have reviewed in connection with that issue. 
There were no federal search warrants, so there would be no applications in which target subjects would be identified. 
There was a local search warrant, but we don't have a copy because we don't have the SDFL file and we haven't asked 
Palm Beach county for theirs. Presumably we will get that at some point. 
Maxwell was added to the caption of the FBI file at some point, and she does come up in some of the 302s (including the 
and gl
nterviews in a manner we're now familiar with). That said, we have the FBI file, 
including all of their 302s, and we plan to produce those. 
I think the proposal to get the physical file from SDFL makes sense and is manageable. We'll have to work through how to 
do that, but OPR has at least some of that material which we could get quickly and start with (including the pros memo), 
and once we figure out how to get the rest, 24 boxes of material is a doable project.

THE OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 
THE OFFICE OF THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL 
FROM: 
UNITED STATES ATTORNEY 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF a 
212-637-2200 
DISTRICT P0C. 
U.S. Attorney 
SYNOPSIS: 
The USAO-SDNY plans to offer deferred prosecution agreements to two correctional officers, Tova Noel and Michael 
Thomas, who were employed at the Manhattan Correctional Center ("MCC") and were previously charged with 
making false statements and conspiring to (i) make false statements and (ii) interfere with or obstruct the lawful 
function of the MCC. These charges, which were brought in November 2019, stem from the correctional officers' 
falsification of institutional count and round forms on the night that Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide. The deferred 
prosecution agreements will require, among other things, the defendants to cooperate with a pending Office of 
Inspector General investigation by providing truthful information about the events in question; an admission of guilt 
from both defendants as to the conduct set forth in the indictment; and for both defendants to complete 100 hours 
of community service, preferably in an area related to the criminal justice system. The USAO-SDNY plans to file a 
public letter by Friday, May 21 notifying the Court of the defendants' acceptance of the deferred prosecution 
agreements and seeking a hearing date; the USAO-SDNY anticipates that the deferred prosecution agreements will 
be entered by the Court by the following Friday, May 28. 
DESCRIPTION: 
On November 14, 2019, USAO-SDNY obtained an indictment against Tova Noel and Michael Thomas which charged 
them with multiple counts of making false statements, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001, and conspiring to (i) make 
false statements and (ii) interfere with or obstruct the lawful function of the MCC, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371. As 
alleged in the Indictment, on August 9 and 10, 2019, the defendants falsely indicated on Bureau of Prison forms that 
they had completed required institutional counts and rounds. On August 10, 2019, inmate Jeffrey Epstein committed 
suicide while housed in the Special Housing Unit at the MCC. After discovering Epstein's body, the defendants 
EFTA00029185
--- PAGE 2 ---
admitted to their supervisor that they had failed to conduct at least some of the required counts and rounds. The 
falsification of records occurred prior to their discovery of Epstein's body. 
The USAO-SDNY plans to offer deferred prosecution agreements to both defendants. The USAO-SDNY has 
determined that deferring the defendants' prosecution is an outcome consistent with the interests of justice, the 
mitigating personal circumstances of the defendants, and the Department's practice in the overwhelming majority of 
other cases in which correctional officers have been investigated or charged with falsifying count or round forms. As 
a condition of the defendants' agreement, they will be required to admit their guilt and cooperate by providing 
truthful information with the Office of Inspector General, which is preparing a report on, among other things, their 
conduct on the night in question, the circumstances in which they discovered Epstein's body after his suicide, and the 
institutional failures that led to Epstein's death at the MCC The agreement does not preclude any administrative 
action or termination by the Bureau of Prisons. The defendants will also be subject to pretrial supervision for six 
months, must refrain from committing any crimes, and will be required to complete 100 hours of community service. 
This outcome is supported by the investigative agencies, the Department of Justice, Office of the Inspector General, 
as well as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and has been approved by Pretrial Services. The USAO-SDNY plans to 
send a public letter by May 21, 2021 to notify the Court that the Government has offered, and the defendants have 
accepted, deferred prosecution agreements, and in order to request a hearing date, which the Government expects 
to be scheduled for the following week, by May 28.

conference whether there will be a report, we plan to say that we don't know, and that OIG's normal process is to 
prepare a report but we don't know whether it will be made public or not.

We were hoping you could assist us with getting in touch with the OIG lawyer who is responsible for preparing the 
report on Epstein's suicide. We have been trying to get in touch with 
who was previously handling the 
investigation, but understand he may have left the office. The time sensitivity is that we plan to file a public letter by 
close of business today regarding reaching a deferred prosecution agreement with the two guards on duty that night 
who have been charged with falsifying records. The guards have agreed to sit for an interview with our office and DOJ-
O16, and we'd like to state in the letter that the interviews would occur as part of an ongoing OIG investigation that we 
expect would lead to a public report. However, we don't want to make this representation unless DOJ-OIG is 
comfortable with it. 
I'm happy to discuss by phone if convenient. 
Thanks very much,

Dear M, 
Please excuse the informality but I am an old experienced civil trial attorney. Luckily, 
I never have represented any client in criminal matters. 
just contacted my office and said that you dropped by her apartment. She was a former 
client. She would like to cooperate but I have my professional responsibility to make some inquiry 
about events that were so long ago. 
Regarding the Epstein matter she is definitely a victim and I hope that you are aware of this fact. 
That being said is she a target in any ongoing investigation? 
Let me know and we can figure a good time to meet and potentially whether or not I am competent 
to represent her. 
Thank you, 
9150 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 241

Just confirmed with 
that we'll need a replacement of the folder called "18 1-14" since it won't copy for him either, 
probably due to the files getting corrupted somehow when the disc was burned. The folder/its contents may be small 
enough that the FBI could send it via USAfx rather than having to burn a new disc, but we'll need a replacement of this 
folder either way.

Hi 
EFTA00029232
--- PAGE 3 ---
Four of the five folders from the disc have successfully uploaded to the folder path linked below, but the fifth folder (18 1-
14) contains at least one file that will not copy off of the disc (not sure if the file is corrupted or what the issue is exactly). 
I'll check with the IT folks and 
to see if they're able to copy the remaining folder off the disc or if we'll need the FBI 
to recopy and resend it. I will keep you posted on the status of this last folder. 
Thanks,

For future victims the best number is 1-800-CALL-FBI. The calls are tracked and then pushed out to the 
investigative teams and appropriate offices. It takes a couple of minutes to get through the dial-in 
instructions, but then you are speaking to a live call taker who pushes us the info. As for the victim you 
are referencing, if you pass 
the contact information of your fried, he can have someone on his team 
go from there.

> I have an investigative journalist friend I trust with my life, who was working with a female retired cop on 
human trafficking. They came across a male victim who appears to be very credible and his story closely 
aligns and is very possibly part of the stuff with Epstein. He was young when the abuse happened but he 
has information about the entire process and specifics on high level government people; one former 
president. M friend is hoping to get him to the NYO ASAP to give a statement and be interviewed. My 
friend, 
(not that 
used to be in the USIC and feels not only is the guy 
credible, his story should be vetted by better equipped entities aka FBI. I haven't been involved in this 
case as I'm at Discover Financial Services and busy as heck. Bute reached out to me and I watched 
portions of a videotaped interview of the guy and I feel he sounds truthful but needs to speak with you 
guys. Is there a direct POC I can have
 contact to set this up. Someone who knows the story of 
trafficking and sexual exploitation of children? I will email that persoreontact information or give 
III his/her information. Btw, the female retired cop is now deceased and I have had a few alleged 
victims reach out to me. I will refer any of them to the FBI in their area. There are a lot.

corruption case. I believe the FBI is working her murder. I only knew her for a few months but it was a 
shock. She had a lot of information on child trafficking. Hopefully the FBI got it. ABC wants to interview me 
on my friendship with her but I'm hesitant to do it.

government's letter regarding the conditions at MDC. As you probably know, the DOJ's discussion about 
conditions in Maxwell's cell attracted much press attention. 
Leaving aside the question of whose assessment is more accurate, the defense is raising the question of whether 
the DOJ should be disclosing such information because of the potential it might contribute to poisoning the jury 
pool. (This could be a ground for appeal if Maxwell were convicted.) 
We would like the government's response to this letter, including its mindfulness about how its disclosures 
might affect Maxwell's right to a fair trial, and whether it would consent to future redactions of the type 
described in the final paragraph. 
Thanks in advance.

The Honorable Alison J. Nathan 
United States District Court 
Southern District of New York 
Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
Enclosed with this cover letter is a form requesting permission for defense counsel to bring 
their personal electronic devices and computing devices to in-person court appearances in the 
above-captioned case. We respectfully request that the Court grant wi-fi access and so order the 
form. 
In addition, the parties have arranged for an evidence view to take place, with the 
defendant present, at 500 Pearl Street the weeks of April 12-16, 2021 and April 19-23, 2021. 
Because much of the evidence is in electronic format, defense counsel will need to bring into the 
courthouse the following equipment to view and photograph the evidence: 
I. VCR player 
2. Cassette player 
3. CD player 
4. Adapter for a micro-VHS tape 
5. Microcassette player 
6. Digital camera 
Accordingly, we respectfully request that the Court grant defense counsel permission to 
bring these items, as well as their personal electronic devices, into the courthouse for the weeks of 
April 12-16, 2021 and April 19-23, 2021.

Can you let me know, urgently, whether anyone in your office is handling the investigation into 
Jeffery Epstein, especially anything in relation to JP Morgan (he was a client of their private wealth

Dear 
This email concerns the investigation into the death of Jeffrey Epstein in 
the MCC. We realize that it is unlikely your office is involved, but we 
thought that we should inform the government of the following so you can 
take whatever action you believe is appropriate. 
EFTA00029262
--- PAGE 4 ---
Jhonny Contreras was recently returned to the SHU in the MCC. At the 
time of Mr. Epstein's death, it is my understanding that Mr. Contreras was 
housed in a cell on the same tier and across the hall from Mr. Epstein's 
cell. Mr. Contreras did not see Mr. Epstein hang himself, but he would be 
willing to speak to investigators, in the presence of counsel, about his 
observations. 
Please let us know if there is anything further we should do to follow-up.

Good afternoon, 
I am planning to bring a laptop and charger for inmate Ghislaine Maxwell (Reg. No. 02879-509) to use 
when reviewing discovery produced from my office. Attached please find the accompanying cover letter, 
which I will hand deliver with the laptop. I am available to make this delivery tomorrow. Would you 
please let me know what time I should arrive with the laptop? 
My understanding from

29th Street near 3rd Avenue and that I should go to the front lobby and ask for 
who will then 
come and retrieve the laptop. Please let me know if that is correct, or if I should take any different steps. 
As always, I can be reached on my cellphone at

have been working with their counsel now to arrange for interviews.

Just FYI regarding the video status as a whole.... You can see the questions I asked our tech people at the bottom. 
We can discuss this next week after the holiday.... 
Hope everyone has a safe and happy Thanksgiving! 
Classification: UNCLASSIFIED//FOUO 
I got looped into the discussion below and you can see the responses that floated around. You are correct in your 
assumption of DVR2, we have not done anything with it since the dates are outside your dates of interest and 
manual rebuilding of DVR2 was not going to be a simple task. 
To that end, the data on DVR2 might(major emphasis on might) be recoverable, but this will be a long term 
project, likely 6 or more months, requiring research and testing, in order to potentially obtain useable video from 
the DVR. There is no guarantee of success and that must be weighed with how much time and resource we want 
to throw at It vs what you MIGHT be able recover. 
If this is something you want OTD/DFAS/DFAU to move forward with, let's discuss it further via conference 
call and then we'll ask you to follow up with a EC request to address this specifically. 
Thanks,

I know you guys have had a nice break from everything Epstein.... However, I'm back 0 We are preparing for 
discovery now and I have to get exact answers regarding all the video that we have available. I apologize in 
advance for all of these questions! 
• We are going to turn over all available footage for the SHU area at MCC — which is on CH0082, CH0080, and 
CH0062. To download all of this footage, what size hard drive will be needed (or how many should I request)? 
• What is the total number of cameras that are available on DVRI? 
• We don't have a camera list that actually correctly names the location of the cameras, correct? Lists that I have 
seen were wrong but I'm not sure if one exists that is correct.... 
• As far as DVR 2, there was a system failure that caused that DVR to stop recording. I know that there would be 
no available footage beyond July 29 for that DVR. I also know that QT was going to have to try and rebuild it 
manually. Did they ever recover any footage or did they discontinue efforts once we told them that dates prior to 
July 29th weren't of interest? I'm not sure where they left off with that part.... 
Thanks!

More information you need for the issues raised today in court 
Deputy United States Marshal 
Southern District of New York 
Due to Ghislaine Maxwell's enhanced security measures at MDC Brooklyn (which has been determined by BOP), the 
USMS must transport the prisoner before all other court productions for the day because her movement later in the day 
would lead to delays in other in-custody court productions that have been scheduled. The USMS does not provide 
additional clothing to prisoners when they are produced for Court. The clothing of prisoners transported from BOP are 
given to them by the facility; not the USMS. Lastly, the USMS does not provide prisoners with utensils for the food they 
come over from MDC with. The USMS does not provide prisoners with their lunches as the facility gives it to them 
without utensils. Usually, the lunch items prisoners have been given do not require the use of utensils.

Do you have a few minutes today or tomorrow to discuss something? Specifically, a good friend of mine is the executive 
producer on a 4-part Netflix series that will come out in a few months on Epstein (they had been working on the story for 
months before we charged). He had spoken to 
at one point (not sure how that worked!) and wants to see 
if anyone from the office would give an interview, all backward looking. I imagine the answer is no but they are going with 
this regardless, so thought I would at least make you and potentially chiefs aware of it. Wanted to start with you. I'm free 
between now and noon or after 6pm tonight, or tomorrow morning or after lunch. Thanks!

As you are undoubtedly aware, there has been some press coverage since yesterday about the release pursuant to FOIA of 
some USMS records. I just spoke with the Associate General Counsel at the USMS, who wanted to provide us with the 
actual source materials (USM lls (equivalent of 302s)) that were inadvertently released, because they were not in all 
circumstances accurately reported, and he wanted to make sure that if we are concerned about any harm to our 
investigation from the release, that we have the original materials. He also offered to serve as a POC if we have any 
questions.

Hey I stopped by your office a couple times Thursday and Friday but didn't catch you, sorry about that -- I'm happy to chat 
on Monday if you're around. My guess is that some combination of the press office and brass would make the call, but 
I'm totally happy to touch base with you if that's useful in the first instance.

I'm happy to have a call. I'm available Monday all morning, Tuesday until 10:30am and Wednesday all morning. 
I apologize about not getting back with you. I thought the other attorney that filed the response was going to do so. 
Regardless, the response included everything that Interlochen has. They only keep tuition payment information for 7 
years and nothing in their files reflects any payments by Epstein or Epstein entities.

Jeff and George, 
Thank you both very much for your assistance in response to our subpoenas seeking records from Interlochen. In 
reviewing the documents you produced in response to the attached subpoena, a follow-up question arose. Would 
you please confirm that your production included all records of any tuition payments that Epstein (or his entities) 
made for any students at Interlochen? 
Our team is also happy to discuss this inquiry over the phone if that would be useful. I am starting a trial tomorrow 
and will have limited availability this week, but my colleagues 
and 
(both cc'd) should be 
able to coordinate with you as needed.

Just confirming receipt. Also, I'm hopeful that we can have everything gathered by April 12th. However, I'll be out of the 
office for the next week so it might be delayed. Will that be a problem? 
In addition, and just for confirmation's sake, you are ok that we will make reasonable efforts to notify the

Hi 
I'm happy to have a call. I'm available Monday all morning, Tuesday until 10:30am and Wednesday all morning. 
I apologize about not getting back with you. I thought the other attorney that filed the response was going to do so. 
Regardless, the response included everything that Interlochen has. They only keep tuition payment information for 7 
years and nothing in their files reflects any payments by Epstein or Epstein entities.

Jeff and George, 
Thank you both very much for your assistance in response to our subpoenas seeking records from Interlochen. In 
reviewing the documents you produced in response to the attached subpoena, a follow-up question arose. Would 
you please confirm that your production included all records of any tuition payments that Epstein (or his entities) 
made for any students at Interlochen? 
Our team is also happy to discuss this inquiry over the phone if that would be useful. I am starting a trial tomorrow 
and will have limited availability this week, but my colleagues 
and 
(both cc'd) should be 
able to coordinate with you as needed.

We submit these materials to you with the understanding that your office's request for 
this information is relevant and material to a valid law enforcement purpose. We further submit

Just confirming receipt. Also, I'm hopeful that we can have everything gathered by April 12th. However, I'll be out of the

In addition, and just for confirmation's sake, you are ok that we will make reasonable efforts to notify the

Hi 
I'm happy to have a call. I'm available Monday all morning, Tuesday until 10:30am and Wednesday all morning. 
I apologize about not getting back with you. I thought the other attorney that filed the response was going to do so. 
Regardless, the response included everything that Interlochen has. They only keep tuition payment information for 7 
years and nothing in their files reflects any payments by Epstein or Epstein entities.

Jeff and George,

Thank you both very much for your assistance in response to our subpoenas seeking records from Interlochen. In 
reviewing the documents you produced in response to the attached subpoena, a follow-up question arose. Would 
you please confirm that your production included all records of any tuition payments that Epstein (or his entities) 
made for any students at Interlochen? 
Our team is also happy to discuss this inquiry over the phone if that would be useful. I am starting a trial tomorrow 
and will have limited availability this week, but my colleagues 
and 
(both cc'd) should be 
able to coordinate with you as needed.

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 282 Filed 05/14/21 Page 1 of 2 
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
United States of America, 
—v—
Ghislaine Maxwell, 
Defendant. 
USDC SONY 
DOCUMENT 
ELECTRONICALLY FILED 
DOC 0: 
DATE FILED: 5/14/21 
20-CR-330 (MN) 
ORDER 
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
On April 29, 2021, counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell wrote to the Court requesting that the 
Court address her sleeping conditions, with particular emphasis on counsel's representation, 
unsupported by affidavit or other factual showing, that guards are shining a flashlight in 
Maxwell's eyes every 15 minutes at night. Dkt. No. 256. Defense counsel claims that the 
flashlight surveillance in Maxwell's eyes is disrupting her sleep, which in turn is impacting her 
ability to prepare for and withstand trial. The Court sought more information by ordering the 
Government to confer with legal counsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to certain 
questions. Dkt. No. 257. In response, the Government states that MDC staff conduct flashlight 
checks of all inmates as a matter of course. Dkt. No. 270. As reported by the Government, 
inmates housed with cell mates in the Special Housing Unit are checked with flashlights every 
minutes. Inmates housed with others in the general population are checked multiple times per 
night at regular intervals. The Government further reports that to conduct the checks, flashlights 
are pointed at the ceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present, breathing, and not in 
distress. As the Government explains, there are a number of neutral reasons why GOP's 
flashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those of other inmates, including 
that Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and the potential stress for inmates that 
EFTA00029354
--- PAGE 2 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 282 Filed 05/14/21 Page 2 of 2 
can arise in high-profile cases. The MDC has determined that these factors necessitate more 
frequent safety and security checks. The Government also indicates that the prohibition on eye 
masks is a generally applicable policy, but that Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other non-
contraband items to cover her eyes. 
To the extent that Maxwell's April 29, 2021 letter asks the Court to override BOP's 
determination as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check procedures, that 
request is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported. Certainly nothing in the 
record plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere with Maxwell's ability to prepare for 
her trial and communicate with her lawyers. Defense counsel's May 7, 2021 letter, Dkt. No. 
272, describes generalized grievances but makes no additional specific and supported application 
for relief. Nevertheless, the Court urges the MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pre-
trial detainees can be reduced. The Court also admonishes the MDC and the Government to 
continue to ensure that Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols that BOP 
determines are necessary for her safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors, 
and consistent with the treatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees. 
The Government shall provide a copy of this Order to the Warden and General Counsel 
for the MDC.

I just wanted to follow up re the August 14th meeting. Is it possible to schedule for early

I do not have any travel plans during the month of August, nor does 
September is a 
busy month with two trials set, and I will be traveling out of the country from Sept 17-30, but I 
will do everything to be as flexible as possible.

Joe, 
As we start thinking about scheduling a next meeting with 
we were wondering if 
you could please let us know if there are any particular weeks that would not work for you or 
your client for a meeting in Florida (in particular, we don't want to interfere with anyone's 
summer vacation plans). 
We will of course be in touch to talk about a next meeting in more detail, but in the first 
instance it would be helpful to get a sense of your schedules, for planning purposes. 
Thanks,

To Whom it May Concern: 
Please be advised that the historical employment records you are requesting, for the time 
period of "1999-2001" are no longer available. 
I can confirm that a 
appears on a spreadsheet dated back to 2000 which 
lists terminated employees tor that time (year 2000). Unfortunately, I am unable to 
confirm whether or not this is the same person due to the fact no other information is listed 
such as a social security number, address, position, etc. The only information listed is a 
first and last name. 
Should you have any further questions, please feel free to contact me at 
Sincerely,

O. 
Before your wife came. 
A. 
I started full-time with him on January 1, 
1991, and we both left December 31, 2002. So I worked 
eleven years exactly. Prior to that, prior to working 
full-time for him, I worked part-time for him, on-and-off 
basis. 
Q. 
What were your responsibilities? 
A. 
In the full-time basis, I started as a 
houseman, and I became a major domo and butler and 
everything else, driver, and did everything. We both did 
all the chores in the house, but I was in charge of the 
house. I was above my wife and above the cleaning crew, 
the gardners, pool people. So I was house manager, major 
domo. 
Q. 
You would have been the go-to guy for the 
house? 
A. 
Yes. And the one who would get the blame. 
Q. 
We are talking about Jeffrey Epstein? 
A. 
Of course. 
Q. 
Do you remember the address of the house? 
A 
SSA Ti Arian 
Q. 
Was it in the beginning of the street --
A. 
At the end of the street, on the left-hand 
side. 
Q. 
We're talking about the same house.

Q. 
During the time that he was here, you 
prepared the house, did all the chores. 
Did you do any of the cleaning? 
A. 
Sometimes. Many times. I did -- last two 
or three years the work was so much that we have to 
hire -- we hire a clean-up crew that they came twice a 
week or once a week, then it was twice a week. Depends 
upon his schedule, because he did not allow anybody at 
the house except us when he was in town. So when he was 
in town, it was just us doing the cleaning and the 
cooking, the driving, shopping, everything else. 
O. 
Did you stay on property in the guest 
house? 
A. 
Yes and no. We had an apartment right 
across the bridge. We had an apartment in 
and we had an apartment at the house. 
Q. 
Why would you stay at the house, then? 
A. 
We stay at the house mostly when he was 
there. When he was not in town, we went home. We went 
to our apartment. When he was there, it was -- the job 
wa* 
inet tnn mulch fn ,In hnma Q n,n1ncle, 10 n'n1nnle and 
come back 5 o'clock in the morning. We would just stay 
and sleep and get up and work.

of guests at the house?

Yes. Many, many, many guests. It was 
never with no guests. 
Q. 
Did he have assistants with him? 
A. 
Assistants? At the last year he had an 
assistant just for him. They would travel with him all 
the time. At the last -- in the last two years of my 
stay there, he also have a chef, a gourmet chef that he 
would travel with him. That's it. 
Q. 
Do you remember the chef's name? 
A. 
There were quite a few. The last one I 
know is 
I think. And he was from 
New York. 
And there was another French chef, 
(phonetic); I don't know his last name. 
And there was another English chef. But 
they went quickly. 
0. 
They would come and go, come and go. 
What about the assistant that was his 
personal assistant that would fly with him? 
A. 
It was an English girl that 
'1 
wnnld travel with him a int and herame the pergnnal 
assistant. But most of the time it was Ms. Maxwell that 
traveled with him all the time.

girlfriend. She was our immediate superior. 
Q. 
Did he have girls come over to give 
massages? 
A. 
Yes. 
Q. 
How many massages would he have in a day? 
A. 
Sometimes one, sometimes two, three. 
Q. 
Was it the same girl that would come back 
to do the massages? 
A. 
Yeah, yeah. Not the same girl -- I mean 
during eleven years, I probably saw a hundred, two 
hundred different massage therapists. 
Q. 
Did they seem young to you? 
A. 
No, sir. Mostly no. We saw one or two 
young ones in the last year. Before that, it was all 
adults. 
Q. 
During your last year when you were working 
with him, what do you mean that they looked young? Did 
they look like they were still in high school? 
A. 
I remember one girl was young. We never 
asked how old she was. It was not in my job. 
Right 
I nviaRrntmnei 
A. 
But I imagine she was 16, 17. In my 
judgment, she was 16, 17. 
Q. 
Where would these massages take place? 
A. 
All the time it was in his room. Sometimes

it was in the balcony of his quarters. His room has a 
wraparound balcony facing the pool. So the massages were 
in the balcony outside in the sun, or inside in his 
bathroom or her bathroom. 
O. 
Would you set up the room for the massages? 
A. 
Many times. Yes, he will tell me, Set up 
the room inside my bathroom or in the bedroom or in 
Elaine's bathroom, or outside on the balcony. And 
g 
would go and set up or my wife would go and set up the 
table. 
We had a table in every room of the house, 
the massage tables, for the different guests. Because 
not only he got massages, all the other guests got 
massages too. So we have a table -- massage table in 
5 
basically every room, guest room. 
Q. 
The girls that would come over to do 
massages, they would massage him first or massage guests? 
A. 
Different times. There were -- mostly they 
was his massage. Mostly he would get massages. 
Q. 
Would Ms. Maxwell be in the room with him 
while he was /jetting the message, 
A. 
We don't know. Apparently we saw her going 
upstairs, because it was -- when they went upstairs, they 
closed -- his quarters, it had a double door, so it was a 
door on top of the stairs -- I don't know if you've been

in the house 
and then there's another door going into 
his room. So it was a long corridor. So everything was 
Page 11
closed and nobody saw anything. 
Q. 
Would you clean up after? 
A. 
Once in a while, yes, I did. Most of the 
times I did. I did the cleanup. 
Q. 
Did it appear as if there was going to be 
more than one massage going on in the room? 
A. 
More than one massage? I don't know. It 
was massages. There was massages, because it was a hot 
oil, and it was -- you know this vibrator, the neck 
vibrators with the long handles. And towels, a lot of 
towels. We used a lot of towels in the house. Used like 
maybe 40, 50 towels a day, because every time he go in 
into the pool, it was two or three towels. Everything 
had to be cleaned up. I went most of the time to pick up 
the room and get it ready. 
Q. 
Did it ever appear to you that more went on 
in the room other than a massage? 
A. 
I just imagine. I never saw anything. But 
I imalina there way meat, than -- I nnynr aaw Anything 
because it was closed doors. It was never done outside. 
Q. 
Based on the cleanup? 
A. 
Based on the cleanup -- at the end, I 
cannot say there was. At the end, it was a few times

that the bed was undone. You know, we make the beds 
three or four times a day. And sometimes we went to 
clean up the massage to put it back, the massage table, 
to pick up the towels, but the bed was undone again. So 
either he took a nap or he went for a nap, I don't know. 
Q. 
Or something else occurred? 
A. 
Or something else. I cannot. 
Q. 
Did the girls, would they bring their own 
stuff or they would use his stuff? 
A. 
No. We had everything. We had gallons of 
stuff, different stuff. 
O. 
Different massage oils? 
A. 
Different, all kinds. 
O. 
Different massagers? 
A. 
Different stuff. 
They would buy all over the world different 
types of -- for different --
Q. 
Did any of these massagers look like sex 
toys? 
A. 
At the end, at the last year that we were 
y hod like

' can pay 
maybe three or four occasions that I saw in the sink, 
they were left out on the sink, and just 
Q.

a basket inside Ms. Maxwell's closet. It was a big 
basket, about this round (indicating), with a cover on 
it. And we used to pick up from the towel and just dump 
it in there. That's it. That's the standard we went 
through. 
Q. 
What sink would you find those massagers 
in? 
A. 
Mostly in his sink, in his bathroom sink. 
Q. 
His bathroom sink? 
Was Ms. Maxwell still his girlfriend at 
that time? 
A. 
Oh, yeah. 
Q. 
Still his girlfriend that you know of right 
now? 
A. 
Yeah. We left, she was still his 
girlfriend. I don't know now, but she was still there. 
Q. 
Why did you leave at the end? 
A. 
It was a hard job. It was an incredible 
hard job. So demanding. Hours were terrible, from 
o'clock in the morning to 10 o'clock at night. 
Constantly or you, foe,-
I got very sick. My health went down the 
drain. I was diagnosed with cancer, polycythemia, a kind 
of blood cancer, and we had to leave. It was just too 
much for me.

Q. 
Sounds like a lot. 
A. 
Yeah. For me and my wife, we both left. 
Q. 
It was very demanding when he was here in 
town? 
A. 
It was terrible. Bad job. Pay was good, 
but we had enough. 
Q. 
I know you guys had a falling out a couple 
of years ago; I guess you weren't working with him 
anymore. This would have been in 2003. You guys had a 
falling out, remember? 
A. 
Yeah, we settled that. 
Q. 
That was settled? 
A. 
That was settled with him between us. 
Q. 
Was that --
A. 
It was an amicable -- it was an agreement, 
mutual agreement. It was a mistake on my part. 
Q. 
Are there any questions you have of me? 
A. 
No. I told you the truth. 
We just imagined things that could have 
happened. I used to talk to my wife all day, working and 
under that environment 
Rut we didn't knnw for sure what 
was going on. 
We never heard anything. We never heard a 
complaint, or a girl crying. 
Q. 
Would these massage girls, especially

towards the end, would they come alone or would they come 
with other people? 
A. 
Mostly they would come alone. It was one 
girl, one of the young girls, the one I can't think of 
it, she would bring somebody else. She'd bring other 
girls. But I didn't even know the names. 
Q. 
All of them would go downstairs? 
A. 
Yes. 
Q. 
Or would one stay downstairs? 
A. 
Most of the times when that girl came, it 
was at night. So after dinner -- after dinner, they went 
to the movies. And by the time they went to the movies, 
we clean up right away and tried to get out of there. 
And that was about 8, 9 o'clock at night. 
After, when they come back, I don't know 
what happened. Our quarters were a different -- I don't 
know if you've been in the house, but our quarters were 
separate.

A. 
Yes. That was 2001. Before that, we had

Right.

A. 
Girls, girls' photographs and guests' 
photographs, yes.

Most of them were dressed. It was a lot of 
entertainment in the pool, around the pool area. But 
most of them were dressed. 
Q. 
When was the last time you spoke with 
Mr. Epstein? 
A. 
The last time I spoke with Mr. Epstein was 
about a week ago, when you left me the card. I got 
scared because of that fallout that we had, and I thought 
it was a consequence of that. And I called and says, 
Jeffrey, what's going-an, what's happening? Beoauoe I 
thought it was an investigation against me on his part. 
Q. 
I'm sorry if I gave you that impression. 
A. 
That's why I called him. That's the only 
reason that I called.

Anyone that works for his attorney? 
A. 
For his attorney? Yes. For his attorney, 
the present attorney? Yes. That was an investigator 
that it was investigated on his side, I can't remember 
his name, but 1 understand it was from Roy Black's 
investigator basically asked me the same questions, 
exactly the same questions: What did I know, what did I

Absolutely not. I would not take it.

A. 
No. He says -- no, he told me not to speak 
to you. He didn't say that to me. He says, It's your 
choice. You make that decision. 
And he says, If you hire a lawyer, you make 
that decision.

A. 
No, no-

Were you to have any contact with him at 
any time after our meeting? 
A. 
If I will have a contact? I have no reason 
for it. I have no reason to call Jeffrey or anybody 
else. This is over, I hope.

Well, Mr.a, 
this is basically an 
ongoing investigation, so obviously anything that we 
discuss hopefully will stay between us. Because it is 
still ongoing, I wouldn't want this out until the 
investigation is complete.

And that was the end of it. 
I think his name was Paul. I only met him 
for about fifteen minutes, ten minutes. 
Q. 
You met at your house? 
A. 
No, no. I don't want him at my house. We 
met at Carrabas restaurant, but it was not open, so we 
met outside Carrabas. It took about ten minutes. 
Q. 
Going back to the items that were found in 
the sink, can you describe any of those massagers? 
A. 
I only saw two things: It was a big, 
big 
I think a vibrator. Big (indicating). And it was 
a long -- I hate to -- I'm sorry. It was a long dick, I 
think. Rubber thing. And there was a thing you used it 
in the back, the vibrator in the back. 
Q. 
What color? 
A. 
We always had those. Not those toys. 
Vibrators, we have different types, one for the neck, one 
for the back. You know the one that has a battery and 
they move, with balls on it, vibrator. That's it.

I've been on his island. I've been as a 
guest, as a vacation. We just took vacations, and I went 
to his island in the Caribbean. And I've been in New 
Mexico. I've been at his house in London. But not as a 
worker, just vacation. 
Q. 
As a vacation? 
A. 
Uh-huh. 
We went to New Mexico for -- it was kind of 
a symposium about how to clean homes. It was this lady

(USANYS)" 
In our call today with counsel for the respective Trustees of the Epstein estate, they asked that we convey a request to 
meet with =, 
and anyone else she would want to include in such a meeting, to discuss the Trustees' interest in 
resolving the Government's potential civil forfeiture claims against the estate. They said they appreciated our (the line 
assistants') willingness to hear their regular updates, but that they understand we're not in a position to negotiate, or 
even to provide feedback on the proposed plan for the fund, and so they'd like the opportunity to elevate that 
discussion and convey why they believe it would be in all parties' interests, including the victims, to engage in 
meaningful discussions about a possible resolution. When you've spoken with =, 
could you please let us know 
whether she's willing to meet with them? And we can convey the response, unless you and/or she would prefer to do 
so directly. If she is willing to meet with them, they were hoping to put a date and time on the calendar as soon as is 
convenient for her after the holiday.

Do you want to review those? Or should they go straight to Audrey? I confess, most of the ones we have done historically 
have been MC related, so they went straight to Audrey, but this one is on Epstein, so if you'd like to see first, let me know.

Subject: Victims' Rights 
As a reminder, the Crime Victims' Rights Act applies in many if not most of our cases. 
We most often deal with the CVRA by making sure that victims know about court appearances and are allowed to be 
heard at sentencing, but the CVRA also provides inter alia, that victims have "(t]he right to be informed in a timely 
manner of any plea bargain or deferred prosecution agreement." 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(9). 
In the attached opinion, a district judge in Miami found that victims' rights were violated when the U.S. Attorney's Office 
entered into a non-prosecution agreement without notifying them. (See pp. 25, et seq.) 
This case is outside our Circuit, involved some unusual facts — including, arguably, actual deception of the victims, rather 
than mere failure to notify — and it does not order a remedy. 
That said, it is a case of some notoriety (Jeffrey Epstein's trafficking and sexual abuse of minors), so it is getting press 
attention and is likely to be on the minds of our judges. Please be mindful of the CVRA as you negotiate pleas, and talk to 
your supervisors about whether, how and when to inform victims. They don't get to determine how we dispose of cases, 
but they're generally entitled to notice. 
Thanks,

Following up on this from a month ago — I know we're living in a different world than what existed four weeks ago, but

have a very basic list of each device or item that was seized and searched, or for which of those we've received

Unfortunately I don't think this is very helpful to us. Did you take a look at the example spreadsheet I sent on 2/24? The 
excel file you sent has descriptions that don't match up to the items listed in the search warrant returns (that we sent on 
EFTA00029445
--- PAGE 3 ---
2/23), and we don't have the 1B or CART numbers to be able to cross-reference. We also can't tell what you mean by 
"loose media" without a specific comparison to what was seized, we don't know which items you're referring to as 
"Windows machines," and we can't tell whether the entirety of any particular item has been transferred, or just partial. 
For example, it looks like we have gotten very, very few image files, which is surprising. 
We have also encountered some very significant problems in trying to review the more than 1 million documents we 
recently received: 
The data we've received has no way to put any emails and attachments together. So if an email says, "see the 
attached flight records," for example, we have no way of linking that up with the records themselves. Not only is 
that a big problem for us in review, it's going to be a huge problem for producing the documents to defense 
counsel. 
The load file has no link to the native file, so when we load the data to the database, there's no way to have the 
native files show up in the database. Because many of the files are too large to open in the viewer, it effectively 
means that there are many files that are completely invisible to us. 
- 
Related, the control numbers in the load file don't match up to the native files. So we have two sets of 
numbers and no way to match up anything—that is, even if we were to try to go hunt down every individual 
large file in the native files, it would be impossible. 
So the data that we most recently got, we need to get in a form that addresses those issues, and we likely will need to 
get a similar reproduction of the data we received a couple months ago. Otherwise we're sifting through more than a 
million documents without much rhyme or reason. 
I've re-attached the spreadsheet we sent last week — I think that's a good place to start in terms of our necessary record-
keeping, and we need that info at the very least, as well as anything else you think would be useful. Also attaching the 
SW returns for reference. And again, we're happy to meet up anytime and hash all this out in person if that's useful.

Here is a listing of what I have already handed over in load files to the US Attorney's Office for taint review. Some points 
of clarification: There were 9 IDE hard drives found in the Manhattan apartment, they turned out to be 3 copies of 3 
drives (9 drives in total) from a July 2007 search on one of his properties. I only processed 3 (as they were all copies). All 
the loose media from the NY apartment is included. All the Windows machines from the NY apartment are included. 
Only 2 Macs from NY and 1 from the Island are included. 
I will have to more closely coordinate with whoever is loading up Relativity with the remaining Macs as the tool 
they have to be processed with does not easily re-name the load files. 
Spreadsheet is attached.

what I think would be most helpful to facilitate that would be a spreadsheet of each separate device referenced in the 
two search warrant returns, with columns for whether we've dumped the contents, whether they've been reviewed 
and/or transferred, what portions were transferred, etc. 
Something roughly like the attached, with any other categories you think would be useful — and the info on the attached 
is mostly hypothetical, obviously, just as examples. That will help us fully understand what's been reviewed, transferred, 
and received so far, and what remains. 
(Also just on the pictures, we do want copies of those as well, please including from the discs and the devices — I think 
FBI was going to do an initial screen to make sure no CP, and since I think the answer was no, we'll need to get those to 
be able to review them as well.)

Sony for the delayed response. They are tearing out our old network and giving us a new one, they mandated 
we delete old stuff (about 400 TB worth). Now that they are working on replacing the network, we can do only 
local work. I should be able to give you an accounting of what is what. I can say, off the top of my head, that all 
windows based items from the NY search have been handed over as well as all loose media. The CDs from NY 
only contained pictures, no documents. There are still some Apple items from NY that need to be produced. As 
far as the Island stuff goes, the 1st item on your spreadsheet, the "kitchen" mac has been produced. Still 
working on the rest.

Team, 
Following up on the below from last weekend, I'm still not sure how we're addressing this so I thought it would make 
sense for us to all schedule a (hopefully relatively brief) meeting to all get on the same page? We didn't hear back on 
which files had previously been provided, but our tech folks did their best to differentiate, and we got access to the 
materials yesterday and its well over a million documents, and we don't have any idea what we're looking at — i.e., 
which devices the materials came from, whether it's full or partial results, how many more devices we have coming, etc. 
Based on the attached search warrant returns, it looks like from the New York mansion (the PDF) there are 
approximately 40 devices that would have storage (computers, hard drives, thumb drives, etc.) and that's not even 
counting at least 60+ CDs. And then from the Virgin Islands (the Excel spreadsheet), at least more than 25 devices, 
including multiple servers / server racks.

So we gotta know what we've already received, what remains, anticipated schedule, etc, and I know it's a lot of moving 
pieces on all sides so wanted to loop in everybody at once. The case team will be in California this coming week from 
Tuesday through Friday, but then I think generally around the first week of March, which will hopefully be plenty of time 
to schedule a productive meeting.

I'm not sure who's the exact right person to ask this, so wanted to get everybody on one email chain about it — I have 
the hard drive that 
dropped off that has new Epstein search warrant materials, but it looks like there are also old 
materials (that I think we had previously received and uploaded??) on the hard drive, and so I'm not sure what's new. 
Just generally, and 
and I talked about this last week too, but it's basically impossible for us to keep track of what 
we're getting, and what has been completed, without some kind of identification or labeling system, along with a list of 
which devices have been extracted and downloaded. 
So for example on the hard drive currently, there are 38 folders labeled "loadFiles" through "37loadFiles" with a 
modified date of 11/14/19, which I think we may have already previously received — but I'm not sure, because we 
haven't gotten any info on which folders match up to which devices, etc. And then there's another folder titled 
"NYC024362" that has a modified date of 1/27/20, so I think that may be the materials we hadn't previously received? 
That folder by itself has more than 600,000 items. 
I don't want to give 
anything that we've already previously received and uploaded, and I can't tell from the folder 
or file names whether everything on the drive is new, or whether just additional materials were saved onto it in addition 
to what we already have. =, 
are you able to give us some guidance on this? Ultimately what we really need is a 
spreadsheet of every device, whether it's been dumped (or partially dumped), and then identifying that same info —
which device, and what materials from it — are being given to us with each data transfer. Otherwise I think 
organizationally and for review purposes it will be a total disaster for us. 
We're happy to have a meeting on this if that's helpful — and thanks everybody for the assistance.

After a lot of back and forth, we've gotten the best contact number for M, 
which was one of the ones on your list —
it's 
. (It's our understanding that she's not currently represented, though of course if she wants to have 
counsel, as with everyone else, she can obtain an attorney or we can also assist in getting her appointed counsel. And 
also similarly, we can jump on a call with her to explain the basics too if that's helpful, but also happy to just have you 
guys make initial contact and then us meet her in person.) 
So it's fine to call her, and she should know that we have an investigation and that we were planning to be in touch, 
though as always we're playing a game of telephone on our end so hard to know for sure. If you're able to make contact 
with her, I think it would make sense to explain what's happening generally but hopefully see if we can go out to 
California to meet with her sometime this month. 
Quick background on her 
Happy to chat further if that's useful, otherwise green light to give her a call.

Subject: Epstein Case A Turning Point In Prosecutorial Accountability?

Importance: Normal 
Epstein Case A Turning Point In Prosecutorial Accountability? 
By Jody Godoy 
Share us on: 
Law360 (February 11, 2019, 9:30 PM EST) --
The U.S. Department of Justice is reviewing a deal 
that a Trump administration official cut as a federal 
prosecutor, and the case has added fuel to a bid to 
change how the DOJ handles prosecutorial 
misconduct probes. 
Last week it came to light that the DOA Office of 
Professional Responsibility had opened an 
investigation into how Labor Secretary Alexander 
Acosta handled a 2008 investigation into an underage 
sex trafficking ring when he was a U.S. attorney. The 
Miami Herald reported in November that Acosta and 
another prosecutor worked with lawyers for 
billionaire Jeffrey Epstein to keep the public eye off 
the case and have Epstein charged with state crimes 
even though investigators had gathered evidence of 
an international trafficking scheme. 
The case has become part of a rallying cry for some 
members of Congress who instead want to see such 
investigations into potential prosecutorial misconduct 
done by the DOJ's Inspector General, which is 
independent from the agency. 
The law currently gives the OIG power to investigate 
alleged misconduct by DOJ employees, except when 
the claims "relate to the exercise of the authority of 
an attorney to investigate, litigate, or provide legal 
EFTA00029471
--- PAGE 2 ---
advice." 
In January, the U.S. House of 
Representativesunanimously passed a bill called the 
Inspector General Access Act that would delete that 
exception. 
At the hearing, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-
Fla., said that while lawmakers on both sides of the 
aisle have long supported the concept, the situation 
has become "urgent." 
"The American people and the victims of these 
horrific crimes deserve to know why justice was not 
served in this disturbing case, and the lack of 
transparency still cloaking it is deeply disturbing," 
Wasserman Schultz said at the hearing, referring to 
the Epstein case. 
Since 1975, the OPR has been in charge of fielding 
and investigating complaints against the DOJ's 
attorneys. The office opens full-blown investigations 
into a fraction of those complaints, ultimately 
determining how the incident occurred, be it a 
mistake or willful misconduct. 
In the past, prosecutors have been suspended or 
reprimanded. In some cases where the OPR has 
found that the conduct didn't rise to misconduct, 
findings get reported back to the attorney's 
supervisor. 
"If you work in the Justice Department, it is really 
scary to be reviewed by OPR," said Jennifer Rodgers, 
a former federal prosecutor who now serves on the 
advisory board at the Center for the Advancement of 
Public Integrity at Columbia Law School. 
But sometimes the attorneys the OPR investigates are 
long gone by that point. According to the most recent 
EFTA00029472
--- PAGE 3 ---
OPR report from 2017, six of the 13 attorneys who 
were found to have committed professional 
misconduct in that year had already left the DOJ by 
the time the investigation concluded. The office 
authorized reporting most of them to their state bar 
associations. 
While the OPR focuses on individuals, Rodgers said 
the OIG's mandate is broader and involves putting 
out public recommendations for systemic change 
within the DOJ. The OIG already gets to review and 
issue advice on issues that involve other DOJ staff, 
such as FBI agents. The bill before Congress would 
put attorneys on the same footing. 
"This may be the case that pushes that over the line. 
And I am OK with that," Rodgers said of the Epstein 
matter. 
The OPR has also changed over the years. In 2015, 
the office started documenting whether its findings 
actually resulted in discipline after a recommendation 
from the Government Accountability Office. The 
office also expanded the number of DOJ attorneys 
who could be reported to bar associations. 
Still, some members of Congress believe the 
Inspector General is better suited to the job, pointing 
to the fact that the OPR is not independent from the 
DOJ and has fewer reporting requirements. 
The Inspector General Access Act is pending before 
the Senate Judiciary Committee. Similar bills have 
been proposed before, including one last year by a 
group of Republican senators including then-
Judiciary Committee head Chuck Grassley of Iowa. 
Grassley supports the 2019 bill, his staff confirmed. 
DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz wrote to 
Congress in support of the bill in November, saying 
EFTA00029473
--- PAGE 4 ---
as a statutorily independent agency the OIG is better 
situated to investigate misconduct claims than the 
OPR, which reports to the deputy attorney general. 
"The credibility of the department's disciplinary 
process is inevitably reduced when the responsible 
component operates under the direction of the 
department's senior leadership and is not subject to 
public scrutiny because of limited transparency," 
Horowitz wrote. 
The OPR does issue an annual report breaking down 
the number of complaints received and how many 
resulted in action. The vast majority of complaints 
pass through the office without further action. In 
2017, 72 of the 636 complaints the OPR received 
resulted in a formal inquiry or investigation. The 
OPR report also gives the outlines of what happened 
in a sample of the cases. 
Bruce Green, a Fordham University law professor 
who writes on prosecutorial misconduct, said the 
OPR's summaries aren't enough to reassure the 
public, particularly given that the office is overseen 
from within the DOJ. 
"Do they go too easy? Are they too willing to credit 
what prosecutors told them? It's hard to know," 
Green said. 
The biggest issue is the lack of independence, Green 
said. He pointed to the example of John Yoo, the DOJ 
attorney in the Bush administration who famously 
authored memos offering a legal justification for 
tactics such as waterboarding that the CIA used after 
the 9/11 terrorist attacks. 
The OPR issued a report in 2009 finding that Yoo and 
Jay Bybee, another DOJ attorney, had committed 
professional misconduct and recommending they be 
EFTA00029474
--- PAGE 5 ---
referred to the state bar for discipline. A DOJ official 
vetoed the move, saying the pair had not violated a 
clear standard. 
Green has written that the advent of digital media 
seems to have initiated a shift towards prosecutorial 
accountability, particularly in the states. However, 
changing the game for federal prosecutors has proven 
more difficult. 
He pointed to laws that were proposed but never 
passed in the wake of the disastrous prosecution of 
former U.S. Senator Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, on 
federal corruption charges. In that case, the OPR had 
concluded that two prosecutors had "engaged in 
reckless professional misconduct" for not handing 
over certain evidence to the defense. 
"For a moment in time, there was a push to reform 
discovery law. But then it died down," Green said.

Thanks, 
The problem is the stuff that is coming today is stuff the team asked PAE to process in early September. I 
realize that this is a big project and that there's only so much that can be done, but it poses almost insurmountable timing 
hurdles for our team if it is taking 1-2 months for PAE to get us stuff we ask for out of Relativity. In most of our cases, this 
one included, that eats up a huge chunk of the time we have available to produce discovery. 
We'll follow up early next week to see if there is a more concrete update, but I think this may require a broader or higher 
level explanation to the Court. I am concerned about requiring our team to take the hit with Judge Nathan for missing 
this deadline.

Some of the data is being sent to use today by FedEX. However, there is a ton of stuff still being processed. That stuff is 
still being imaged. Then it gets marked. Then copied to us. I have spoken to 
He thinks it is not possible to 
meet the November 9 date. He thinks the next step might be done on Tuesday, and then a better estimate of completion 
might be possible.

During the course of reviewing my emails, as described in the Epstein Transition Memo dated October 9, 2020, I moved 
approximately 160 non-substantive (but arguably or clearly related to the case in some fashion) emails to a separate 
folder in Outlook. In the process of doing so, approximately 140 of those emails were duplicated. Today, I deleted the 
duplicate version of those emails, taking care to ensure that one copy of each email remains in that folder, consistent with 
the litigation hold in this case.

Hi Jim, Here's a rundown of the story I'm working on. Am seeking guidance from SDNY on the office's thinking at the 
time, if FBI was looped in, and who the decision-maker was on this. Apologies for the long email but I figure better to 
provide as much detail as possible. My editors are pretty interested in this one. 
On Feb. 29, 2016, Epstein victims' attorneys Stan Pottinger, Brad Edwards and Peter Skinner met with then-AUSA 
and pitched her on an investigation of the Epstein scheme. I'm told 
had questions about 
establishing venue, the South Florida NPA, statute of limitations issues and the general DO1 tradition of not second-
guessing another US Attorney. She wondered if the attorneys were proposing an investigation of new conduct, or rather 
a re-do of the South Florida case. (This is all from sources familiar). 
According to Edwards's book, the team of attorneys left the meeting feeling hopeful. 
The AUSA acted confident that a case would be brought against Epstein for crimes committed against 
and 
others in New York. Of course, first 
EFTA00029499
--- PAGE 2 ---
she had to have facts, witnesses, evidence, and victims of a New York crime. 
We assured the prosecutor that the number of victims in New York far exceeded 
those discovered in Florida. The group walked out excited that New 
York was finally going to bring a case against Epstein. I said to David and 
Pete, "Don't hold your breath, the Southern District obviously doesn't know 
who they're dealing with yet." 
The effort went nowhere, as far as the victims' attorneys know. Then, after attorneys David Boies and Sigrid McCawley 
took Maxwell's depositions in the 
case, Boies re-approached SDNY, I'm told. The meeting took place in August or 
September between Boies, Pottinger and Kramer. They pitched SDNY on charging Maxwell with perjury. They also 
believed Epstein, who was paying Maxwell's legal bills, was in a perjury conspiracy. They saw this as a work-around to 
oncerns about the NPA etc. 
But t at also went nowhere. Obviously everything changed after the Miami Herald articles and SDNY opened an 
investigation under Berman. 
In addition to the headline that SDNY initially passed on tackling the case, this story will also note how the contact 
between victims' attorneys and SDNY relates to the perjury counts in Maxwell's criminal case. She's said in filings she 
was the victim of a "perjury trap," presumably set by Boies in cahoots with SDNY. (From her perspective). 
Questions: 
Why didn't SDNY pursue the Epstein case in 2016? 
Why didn't it pursue perjury counts? 
Did SDNY contact the FBI or South Florida prosecutors about Epstein during that period? 
Who was the decision maker after Kramer met with the victims' attorneys? 
Did Preet make the call? 
This story is tentatively scheduled for Tuesday, so this is not super urgent. Hope to hear from you tomorrow.

I will continue to forward updates as I get them. 
It is really quite extraordinary that our team was able to conduct an investigation of great sensitivity and public 
interest with complicated witnesses over a period of several months, resulting in an excellent indictment, and 
manage to keep it all entirely covert. It has been an effort requiring enormous sophistication, judgment and 
dedication, which is a testament to you all. And the case is a righteous one. Thank you all. Geoff

--- PAGE 2 ---
• 
In the case caption, please delete "defendant(s)," so that it does not read "defendant(s) Jeffrey Epstein". I'm not 
sure if that's the form language, but it looks like a typo. 
• 
Regarding the hearing information, there are several other court dates. I'll forward you the scheduling order so 
that you can add them. 
• 
Please swap out this language: 
Because of the Court's schedule, hearing dates could change on very short notice. If you plan on attending, 
you may want to call the VNS Call Center or check the website to confirm the date and time. Please note, 
there is a 24-hour delay in information transfer to the website. 
And replace it with this language: 
If you plan on attending, please call me at 
in case there are any last minute changes. 
Thanks!

Subject: ROLLING STONE; Who Is British Socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein's Longtime 
Partner? 
Date: Wed, 10 Jul 2019 18:26:14 +0000 
Importance: Normal 
Who Is British Socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey 
Epstein's Longtime Partner? 
The daughter of a British media mogul, Maxwell is alleged to 
have served as a "madam" for her billionaire partner 
Since hedge fund manager and well-connected billionaire Jeffrey Epstein was arrested on Saturday and 
charged with sex trafficking  and sex trafficking conspiracy, the names of powerful men in his social 
circle — including President Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton, and, weirdly, former lead 
investigator of the Clinton/Lewinsky scandal Kenneth Starr — have popped up over and over and over again. 
Notably, only one woman's name has made a recurring appearance in discussions of Epstein's crimes: that 
of Ghislaine Maxwell,  a British socialite and Epstein's longtime confidante, who is alleged to have played a 
pivotal role in procuring young women for him. 
Although no charges have been filed against Maxwell — or anyone else in Epstein's inner circle, for 
that matter — she has long been dogged by allegations that she played a pivotal role in procuring 
young women for Epstein, and has been named in numerous civil suits to that effect. As for Epstein 
himself, he pleaded not guilty to the charges against him on Monday. (Rolling Stone reached out to 
Epstein's legal team for comment, but has not received a response. Maxwell has denied any 
involvement in the past, with a representative calling the allegations "obvious lies.") 
Surprisingly, given Maxwell's relatively high-profile role in both the English and American social 
scenes, fairly little is known about her or the exact nature of her relationship with Epstein: she's been 
alternately referred to as Epstein's romantic partner, his best friend, his fixer, and a "madam" catering 
to his sexual desires. Here's what we do know about the woman who has been a member of Epstein's 
inner circle for decades — and whether we can expect to see her playing a larger role in the criminal 
proceedings against him. 
Who is Ghislaine Maxwell? 
Maxwell is the daughter of British media mogul Robert Maxwell, who owned and operated a number of 
British tabloids and was at one point estimated to have been worth nearly $1.9 billion. She was 
educated at the prestigious Marlborough boarding school in the U.K., and went on to study at Oxford. 
The Maxwells were active in both British and American social circles, and the family apparently had 
ties to Trump before even Epstein did: a 1989 clipping from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch lists Trump as 
a guest on Robert Maxwell's yacht, the aptly named Lady Ghislaine. In 1991, Maxwell was found dead 
EFTA00029524
--- PAGE 2 ---
under mysterious circumstances after reportedly having fallen overboard from the yacht. It was later 
discovered that he was in a significant amount of debt at the time of his death, and had embezzled 
from his employees' pension fund. 
Before her father's death, Maxwell had already started building her credentials as a British socialite 
and philanthropist; she founded the Kit-Cat Club, a social organization for working  women, and 
also served as director for a football club her father owned. Following her father's passing, however, 
she moved to the United States, eager to escape the scrutiny of the U.K. tabloids. While she started out 
working in real estate and living on the (relatively) modest trust fund sum of $100,000 a year, Maxwell 
quickly rebounded from her father's passing and subsequent disgrace, according to a 2000 New York 
Post profile, relying on the Maxwell family's powerful network of famous friends to regain her position 
in the social world. 
For the past two decades, Maxwell has held the types of board positions and charitable foundation 
advisory roles favored by the uber-wealthy, founding the charitable organization the TerraMar Project, 
which works to preserve the world's oceans,  in 2012. She also continued to cultivate friendships 
with extremely high-powered individuals such as Trump and Prince Andrew, reportedly introducing 
Epstein to the latter in 1997 and former President Bill Clinton, even appearing as a guest at Chelsea 
Clinton's wedding in 2010. 
What is Ghislaine Maxwell's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein? 
According to the 2000 New York Post profile of Maxwell, Epstein and Maxwell began dating in the late 1990s; 
the piece not-so-subtly implies that Maxwell largely viewed Epstein, who at that point had become extremely 
wealthy from his investment firm J. Epstein & Co., as a strategic launch pad for her career as a New York City 
philanthropist and socialite. Although their romantic relationship later fizzled out, the two developed a dose 
platonic bond, according to a 2003 Vanity Fair profile of Epstein, in which he refers to Maxwell as his "best 
friend." The Vanity Fair profile depicts Maxwell as something of a high-end assistant to Epstein, with journalist 
Vicky Ward writing that Maxwell "seems to organize much of his life," even making appointments with personal 
yoga instructors for Epstein. 
What is Ghislaine Maxwell's relationship to Jeffrey Epstein's crimes? 
According to those who have accused Epstein of sexual abuse, Maxwell's predilection for managing his 
life extended to his sex life as well. In 2018, Epstein and Maxwell settled a lawsuit brought against 
them by a woman named 
, who
 that Maxwell hired her to give Epstein 
massages at his home. Between 2006 and 2007, 
alleged, the two promised to pay her tuition 
to FIT in exchange for 
providing sexual favors to Epstein and his friends, including lawyer 
Alan Dershowitz. (Dershowitz has repeatedly denied the charges; 
suit was settled in 
2018 under undisclosed terms.) 
Last April, another woman and former Epstein employee, 
alleged that Maxwell and 
Epstein had sexually abused her and her 15-year-old sister on two separate occasions in the 
mid-1990s. She also alleged that she frequently saw a "number of school-age girls" come to Epstein's 
New York City home. "When I asked Maxwell why these young girls were coming over to the house so 
often she said that the girls were interviewing for modeling positions," 
said. "At the time, 
based on my observations at the home, it did not seem credible to me that these young girls were 
interviewing for modeling positions." 
allegations surfaced as the result of a defamation lawsuit filed against Dershowitz by 
,who also named Maxwell in a 2015 civil suit against Epstein. In the sult,ethen
identified as Jane Doe 3) alleged that during the summer of 1999, when she was 16 years old and 
working as a towel girl at Trump's Palm Beach resort Mar-a-Lago, Maxwell recruited her to serve as 
EFTA00029525
--- PAGE 3 ---
Epstein's massage therapist. 
alleged that Maxwell and Epstein instructed her to have sex with 
him and his friends, including Dershowitz. Dershowitz publicly denied her claims and accused 
of making them up, prompting 
to sue him for defamation. Last week, Dershowitz filed a motion 
fora federal judge to dismiss the defamation suit. 
After 
original civil suit against Maxwell and Epstein was settled in 2017, a judge ordered that 
2,000-odd pages of documents related to the case be sealed; however, earlier this month, a U.S. Court 
of Appeals judge ruled that some of the documents could be unsealed, though it did not specify when. 
Although prosecutors said during Epstein's initial court appearance on Monday that a superseding 
indictment was not "imminent," it was "certainly possible" that charges may be filed against additional 
individuals "down the road." 
Maxwell has yet to issue a public statement following Epstein's arrest; Rolling Stone reached out to 
Maxwell and the Terramar Project to request comment, but did not immediately receive a response.

The Government expects Minor Victim-3 to testify, in substance and in part, that she met 
the defendant when she was approximately 17 years old. Within a few weeks of meeting the 
defendant, at the defendant's invitation, Minor Victim-3 went to the defendant's townhouse in 
London for tea. The defendant expressed an interest in Minor Victim-3, talked with Minor Victim-
about Minor Victim-3's life and interests, and told Minor Victim-3 about her boyfriend Jeffrey 
Epstein, who she wanted Minor Victim-3 to meet. Shortly after, the defendant invited Minor 
Victim-3 to her home. During that first visit, the defendant introduced Minor Victim-3 to Epstein 
and encouraged her to give Epstein a foot massage. Epstein instructed Minor Victim-3 to massage 
his shoulders. Minor Victim-3 left the townhouse after she was excused. 
Shortly thereafter, the defendant invited Minor Victim-3 to her home again and encouraged 
Minor Victim-3 to provide Epstein with a massage. The defendant showed Minor Victim-3 to a 
room in which a massage table was set up. Epstein was in the room. Epstein removed his robe 
and was naked. The defendant handed Minor Victim-3 oil and closed the door. After the massage, 
the defendant was outside the room and asked if Minor Victim-3 had fun and whether Epstein 
liked the massage. The defendant subsequently told Minor Victim-3 that Epstein was impressed 
with her and asked her to come back to her townhouse. The defendant encouraged Minor Victim-
to provide a massage to Epstein. The defendant thanked Minor Victim-3, indicating that if it 
wasn't Minor Victim-3 or someone else, it would all fall to her (the defendant). The defendant 
again showed Minor Victim-3 to a room with a massage table where Epstein was naked. Both 
massages involved at least one sex act with Minor Victim-3. 
Following those two encounters, the defendant and Epstein invited Minor Victim-3 to 
travel with them to Florida, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and New York. Minor Victim-3 eventually 
accepted these invitations, but she does not recall whether she was 17 or 18 when she took her first 
trip at Epstein and the defendant's invitation. Minor Victim-3 traveled to visit the defendant and 
Epstein in New York, Palm Beach, and Little Saint James. When Minor Victim-3 met the 
defendant and Epstein in these locations, she provided additional massages to Epstein, during 
which he engaged in sex acts with Minor Victim-3. Over the course of their interactions, the 
defendant made multiple statements to Minor Victim-3 reflecting the defendant's awareness that 
Epstein engaged in sex acts with Minor Victim-3. On at least one occasion, the defendant asked 
Minor Victim-3 if she knew any other young females to bring to Epstein and made comments to 
Minor Victim-3 about Epstein's significant sexual needs. 
On one occasion in Palm Beach, the defendant provided Minor Victim-3 with a schoolgirl 
uniform and told Minor Victim-3, in substance and in part, that she should bring Epstein his tea in 
the uniform. After Minor Victim-3 brought Epstein tea that had been provided by the defendant, 
Epstein raped Minor Victim-3.

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 208 Filed 04/16/21 Page 1 of 34 
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
United States of America, 
—v—
Ghislaine Maxwell, 
Defendant. 
USDC SDNY 
DOCUMENT 
ELECTRONICALLY FILED 
DOC 0: 
DATE FILED: 4/16/21 
20-cr-330 (MN) 
OPINION & ORDER 
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
In June 2020, a grand jury returned a six-count indictment charging Ghislaine Maxwell 
with facilitating the late financier Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse of minor victims from around 
1994 to 1997. The Government filed a first (S1) superseding indictment shortly thereafter, 
which contained only small, ministerial corrections. The SI superseding indictment included 
two counts of enticement or transportation of minors to engage in illegal sex acts in violation of 
the Mann Act and two counts of conspiracy to commit those offenses. It also included two 
counts of perjury in connection with Maxwell's testimony in a civil deposition. Trial is set to 
begin on July 12, 2021. 
Maxwell filed twelve pretrial motions seeking to dismiss portions of the Si superseding 
indictment, suppress evidence, and compel discovery. After the parties fully briefed those 
motions, a grand jury returned a second (S2) superseding indictment adding a sex trafficking 
count and another related conspiracy count. 
This Opinion resolves all of Maxwell's currently pending pretrial motions other than 
those seeking to suppress evidence, which the Court will resolve in due course. The motions, and 
this Opinion, deal exclusively with the S 1 superseding indictment and do not resolve any issues 
EFTA00029540
--- PAGE 2 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 208 Filed 04/16/21 Page 2 of 34 
related to the newly added sex trafficking charges. For the reasons that follow, the Court denies 
Maxwell's motions to dismiss the SI superseding indictment in whole or in part. It grants her 
motion to sever the perjury charges for a separate trial. It denies her motion to further expedite 
discovery. 
The Court provides a brief summary of its conclusions here and its reasoning on the 
pages that follow: 
• 
Maxwell moves to dismiss all counts based on a non-prosecution agreement between 
Jeffrey Epstein and the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida. The Court 
concludes that the agreement does not apply in this District or to the charged offenses. 
• 
Maxwell moves to dismiss all counts as untimely. The Court concludes that the 
Government brought the charges within the statute of limitations and did not unfairly 
delay in bringing them. 
• 
Maxwell moves to dismiss the Mann Act counts because they are too vague, or in the 
alternative to require the Government to describe the charges in greater detail. The 
Court concludes that the charges are specific enough. 
• 
Maxwell moves to dismiss the perjury counts because, in her view, her testimony 
responded to ambiguous questioning and was not material. The Court concludes that 
these issues are best left for the jury. 
• 
Maxwell moves to sever the perjury counts from the Mann Act counts so that they can 
proceed in a separate trial. The Court concludes that severance is appropriate and will 
try the perjury counts separately. 
• 
Maxwell moves to strike language from the indictment that she believes is superfluous 
and to dismiss conspiracy counts she believes are redundant. The Court concludes that 
these motions are premature before trial. 
• 
Maxwell moves to compel the Government to immediately disclose certain categories 
of evidence. The Court concludes that she is not entitled to do so, but the Court will 
order Maxwell and the Government to confer on a discovery schedule. 
• 
Maxwell moves to dismiss all counts because a grand jury in White Plains, rather than 
Manhattan, returned the  Si superseding indictment. Because a jury in Manhattan 
returned the S2 superseding indictment, the motion appears moot.

I. 
Jeffrey Epstein's non-prosecution agreement does not bar this prosecution 
In September 2007, under investigation by both federal and state authorities, Jeffrey 
Epstein entered into a non-prosecution agreement ("NPA") with the Office of the United States 
Attorney for the Southern District of Florida. Dkt. No. 142 at 1-2. Epstein agreed in the NPA to 
plead guilty in Florida state court to soliciting minors for prostitution and to serve eighteen 
months in a county jail. Id. In exchange, the U.S. Attorney's Office agreed not to charge him 
with federal crimes in the Southern District of Florida stemming from its investigation of his 
conduct between 2001 and 2007. Id. It also agreed not to bring criminal charges against any of 
his "potential co-conspirators." Id. 
As a recent report from the Department of Justice's Office of Professional Responsibility 
observed, the NPA was unusual in many respects, including its breadth, leniency, and secrecy. 
OPR Report, Gov. Ex. 3, Dkt. No. 204-3, at x, 80, 175, 179, 260-61. The U.S. Attorney's 
promise not to prosecute unidentified co-conspirators marks a stark departure from normal 
practice for federal plea agreements. This provision appears to have been added "with little 
discussion or consideration by the prosecutors." Id. at 169, 185. The report concluded that the 
U.S. Attorney's negotiation and approval of the NPA did not amount to professional misconduct, 
but nonetheless reflected "poor judgment." Id. at 169. 
Only the NPA's effect, and not its wisdom, is presently before the Court. Maxwell 
contends that the NPA bars this prosecution, because she is charged as a co-conspirator of 
Jeffrey Epstein and the NPA's co-conspirator provision lacks any geographical or temporal 
limitations. The Court disagrees for two independent reasons. First, under controlling Second 
Circuit precedent, the NPA does not bind the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New 
York. Second, it does not cover the offenses charged in the S1 superseding indictment. 
EFTA00029542

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 208 Filed 04/16/21 Page 4 of 34 
A. The non-prosecution agreement does not bind the U.S. Attorney for the 
Southern District of New York 
United States Attorneys speak for the United States. When a U.S. Attorney makes a 
promise as part of a plea bargain, both contract principles and due process require the federal 
government to fulfill it. See Santobello v. New York, 404 U.S. 257, 262 (1971); United States v. 
Ready, 82 F.3d 551, 558 (2d Cir. 1996). The question here is not whether the U.S. Attorney for 
the Southern District of Florida had the power to bind the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District 
of New York. The question is whether the terms of the NPA did so. Applying Second Circuit 
precedent and principles of contract interpretation, the Court concludes that they did not. 
In United States v. Annabi, the Second Circuit held: "A plea agreement binds only the 
office of the United States Attorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it 
affirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction." 771 F.2d 670, 672 
(2d Cir. 1985) (per curiam). This is something akin to a clear statement rule. Single-district plea 
agreements are the norm. Nationwide, unlimited agreements are the rare exception. Applying 
Annabi, panels of the Second Circuit have stated that courts cannot infer intent to depart from 
this ordinary practice from an agreement's use of phrases like "the government" or "the United 
States." United States v. Salameh, 152 F.3d 88, 120 (2d Cir. 1998) (per curiam); United States v. 
Gonzalez, 93 F. App'x 268, 270 (2d Cir. 2004). Those are common shorthand. A plea 
agreement need not painstakingly spell out "the Office of the United States Attorney for Such-
and-Such District" in every instance to make clear that it applies only in the district where 
signed. 
Maxwell asks this Court to draw the opposite conclusion. The provision of the NPA 
dealing with co-conspirators does not expressly state that it binds U.S. Attorneys in other 
districts. It does not expressly state that it applies in other districts. The relevant language, in 
EFTA00029543
--- PAGE 5 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 208 Filed 04/16/21 Page 5 of 34 
its entirety, reads as follows: "the United States also agrees that it will not institute any criminal 
charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein." Dkt. No. 142-1 at 5. Under Annabi, 
Salatneh, and Gonzalez, a statement that "the United States" agrees not to prosecute implies no 
restriction on prosecutions in other districts. 
Two provisions of the NPA refer specifically to prosecution in the Southern District of 
Florida. The first states that the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida will defer 
"prosecution in this District" if Epstein complies with the agreement. Dkt. No. 142-1 at 2. The 
second states that no prosecution "will be instituted in this District, and the charges against 
Epstein if any, will be dismissed" after he fulfills the agreement's conditions. Maxwell contends 
that the lack of similar language in the co-conspirator provision must mean that it lacks any 
geographical limitation. If anything, that language reflects that the NPA's scope was expressly 
limited to the Southern District of Florida. It is not plausible—let alone "affirmatively 
apparent", Annabi, 771 F.2d at 672,—that the parties intended to drastically expand the 
agreement's geographic scope in the single sentence on the prosecution of co-conspirators 
without clearly so saying. 
Without an affirmative statement in the NPA's text, Maxwell turns to its negotiation 
history. Under Second Circuit precedent she may offer evidence that negotiations of the NPA 
between the defendant and the prosecutors included a promise to bind other districts. See United 
States v. Russo, 801 F.2d 624, 626 (2d Cir. 1986). She alleges that officials in the U.S. 
Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida sought and obtained approval for the NPA 
from the Office of the Deputy Attorney General and communicated with attorneys in other 
districts. Any involvement of attorneys outside the Southern District of Florida appears to have 
been minimal. Maxwell has already received access to an unusually large amount of information 
EFTA00029544
--- PAGE 6 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 208 Filed 04/16/21 Page 6 of 34 
about the NPA's negotiation history in the form of the OPR report and yet identifies no evidence 
that the Department of Justice made any promises not contained in the NPA. The OPR report 
reflects that the Office of the Deputy Attorney General reviewed the NPA, but only after it was 
signed when Epstein tried to get out of it. OPR Report at 103. Other documents show that 
attorneys in the Southern District of Florida reached out to other districts for investigatory 
assistance but not for help negotiating the NPA. Dkt. No. 204-2. Nor would direct approval of 
the NPA by the Office of the Deputy Attorney General change the meaning of its terms. No 
evidence suggests anyone promised Epstein that the NPA would bar the prosecution of his co-
conspirators in other districts. Absent such a promise, it does not matter who did or did not 
approve it. 
Second Circuit precedent creates a strong presumption that a plea agreement binds only 
the U.S. Attorney's office for the district where it was signed. Maxwell identifies nothing in the 
NPA's text or negotiation history to disturb this presumption. The Court thus concludes that the 
NPA does not bind the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. 
B. The non-prosecution agreement does not cover the charged offenses 
The NPA would provide Maxwell no defense to the charges in the S1 superseding 
indictment even against an office bound to follow it. The NPA bars prosecution, following 
Epstein's fulfillment of its conditions, only for three specific categories of offenses: 
(1) "the offenses set out on pages 1 and 2" of the NPA; namely, "any offenses that 
may have been committed by Epstein against the United States from in or around 
2001 through in or around September 2007" including five enumerated offenses; 
(2) "any other offenses that have been the subject of the joint investigation by the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States Attorney's Office"; and 
(3) "any offenses that arose from the Federal Grand Jury investigation." 
EFTA00029545
--- PAGE 7 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 208 Filed 04/16/21 Page 7 of 34 
Dkt. No. 142-1 at 2. The NPA makes clear that the covered charges are those relating to 
and deriving from a specific investigation of conduct that occurred between 2001 and 2007. 
Maxwell contends that the NPA's co-conspirator provision lacks any limitation on the 
offenses covered. The Court disagrees with this improbable interpretation. The phrase 
"potential co-conspirator" means nothing without answering the question "co-conspirator in 
what?" The most natural reading of the co-conspirator provision is that it covers those who 
conspired with Epstein in the offenses covered by the NPA for their involvement in those 
offenses. Thus, it would cover any involvement of Maxwell in offenses committed by Epstein 
from 2001 to 2007, other offenses that were the subject of the FBI and U.S. Attorney's Office 
investigation, and any offenses that arose from the related grand jury investigation. 
The Court has no trouble concluding that the perjury counts are not covered by the NPA. 
Those charges do not relate to conduct in which Maxwell conspired with Epstein and stem from 
depositions in 2016, more than eight years after Epstein signed the NPA. Maxwell now 
concedes as much, though her motion sought to dismiss the Si superseding indictment in its 
entirety, perjury counts and all. 
The Mann Act counts, too, fall comfortably outside the NPA's scope. The Si 
superseding indictment charges conduct occurring exclusively between 1994 and 1997, some 
four years before the period covered by the Southern District of Florida investigation and the 
NPA. The NPA does not purport to immunize Epstein from liability for crimes committed 
before the period that was the subject of the FBI and U.S. Attorney's Office investigation. 
Maxwell's protection is no broader. The Court thus concludes that the NPA does not cover the 
offenses charged in the SI superseding indictment.

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 208 Filed 04/16/21 Page 8 of 34 
C. Maxwell is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing 
In the alternative to dismissing the indictment, Maxwell requests that the Court conduct 
an evidentiary hearing as to the parties' intent in the NPA. The Court finds no basis to do so. 
The cases Maxwell cites where courts held hearings on the scope of a plea agreement 
mostly involved oral agreements where there was no written record of the full set of terms 
reached by the parties. All of them involved defendants with first-hand knowledge of 
negotiations who claimed prosecutors breached an oral promise. "An oral agreement greatly 
increases the potential for disputes such as . .. a failure to agree on the existence, let alone the 
terms, of the deal." United States v. Aleman, 286 F.3d 86, 90 (2d Cir. 2002). Thus, an 
evidentiary hearing may be necessary to determine the terms of an agreement never committed to 
writing. This is no such case. The NPA's terms are clear. Beyond the NPA itself, an extensive 
OPR report details its negotiation history. No record evidence suggests that prosecutors 
promised Epstein anything beyond what was spelled out in writing. The Court agrees with the 
Government that Maxwell's request for a hearing rests on mere conjecture. 
For the same reason, the Court will not order the discovery on the NPA. In any case, it 
appears that the Government has already produced two of the documents Maxwell seeks in her 
motion—the OPR report and notes mentioned in a privilege log. Of course, the Government's 
disclosure obligations would require it to disclose to Maxwell any exculpatory evidence or 
evidence material to preparing the defense, including any evidence supporting a defense under 
the NPA. The Government shall confirm in writing within one week whether it views any 
evidence supporting Maxwell's interpretation of the NPA as material it is required to disclose, 
and, if so, whether it has disclosed any and all such evidence in its possession.

II. 
The indictment is timely 
A. The indictment complies with the statute of limitations 
Federal law imposes a five-year limitations period for most non-capital offenses. 18 
U.S.C. § 3282(a). Recognizing the difficulty of promptly prosecuting crimes against children, 
Congress has provided a longer limitations period for "offense[s] involving the sexual or 
physical abuse, or kidnaping" of a minor. 18 U.S.C. § 3283. Until 2003, the operative version 
of § 3283 allowed prosecution of these offenses until the victim reached the age of twenty-five. 
Congress further extended the limitations period in the PROTECT Act of 2003, Pub. L. No. 108-
21, 117 Stat. 650, to allow prosecution any time during the life of the victim. 
The parties agree that the Mann Act charges are timely if subject to the PROTECT Act, 
but untimely under the general statute of limitations for non-capital offenses or the pre-2003 
version of § 3283. Maxwell contends that the charged offenses do not qualify as offenses 
involving the sexual or physical abuse or kidnapping of a minor and are thus governed by the 
general statute of limitations. Alternatively, she contends that the pre-2003 version of § 3283 
applies because the charged conduct occurred prior to 2003. The Court concludes that statute of 
limitations in the PROTECT Act applies and that the charges are timely. 
1. The Mann Act charges are offenses involving the sexual abuse of minors 
Maxwell does not dispute that the facts alleged in the SI superseding indictment involve 
the sexual abuse of minors. The indictment charges that Epstein sexually abused each of the 
alleged minor victims and that Maxwell allegedly enticed them to travel or transported them for 
that purpose. Instead, Maxwell contends that charged offenses do not qualify as offenses 
involving the sexual abuse of minors because sexual abuse is not an essential ingredient of each 
statutory offense. See Bridges v. United States, 346 U.S. 209, 221 (1953). In Maxwell's view, 
EFTA00029548
--- PAGE 10 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 208 Filed 04/16/21 Page 10 of 34 
for example, it is possible to transport a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity 
and not follow through with the planned sexual abuse, and so sexual abuse is not an essential 
ingredient of the offense. Maxwell makes the same argument for the enticement and related 
conspiracy charges. 
This approach is analogous to the "categorical approach" employed by courts to evaluate 
prior convictions for immigration and sentencing purposes. See Taylor v. United States, 495 
U.S. 575, 602 (1990). Generally speaking, the "categorical approach" requires that courts "look 
only to the statutory definitions—i.e., the elements" of the relevant offense to determine if the 
provision applies "and not to the particular facts underlying those convictions." Descamps v. 
United States, 570 U.S. 254, 261 (2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). Whether a statute 
requires a categorical or case-specific approach is a question of statutory interpretation. To 
determine whether Congress used the word "offense" in a statute to refer to an offense in the 
abstract or to the facts of each individual case, the Court must examine the statute's "text, 
context, and history." United States v. Davis, 139 S. Ct. 2319, 2327 (2019). 
Though it has not authoritatively settled the question, the Second Circuit has strongly 
suggested that Maxwell's approach is the wrong one. In Weingarten v. United States, 865 F.3d 
48, 58-60 (2d Cir. 2017), the Second Circuit discussed at length how the text, context, and 
history of § 3283 show that Congress intended courts to apply the statute using a case-specific 
approach. The Third Circuit reached the same conclusion in United States v. Schneider, 801 
F.3d 186, 196 (3d Cir. 2015). 
The Court sees no reason to depart from the reasoning in Weingarten. First, "[t]he 
Supreme Court's modem categorical approach jurisprudence is confined to the post-conviction 
contexts of criminal sentencing and immigration deportation cases." Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 58. 
EFTA00029549
--- PAGE 11 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 208 Filed 04/16/21 Page 11 of 34 
To the extent that the categorical approach is ever appropriate in other contexts, it is 
inappropriate here. 
The Court begins with the statute's text. Statutes that call for application of the 
categorical approach typically deal with the elements of an offense in a prior criminal conviction. 
Id. at 59. "The language of § 3283, by contrast, reaches beyond the offense and its legal 
elements to the conduct involv[ed]' in the offense. That linguistic expansion indicates Congress 
intended courts to look beyond the bare legal charges in deciding whether § 3283 applied." Id. at 
59-60 (alteration in original) (quoting § 3283). Maxwell cites one case holding otherwise, but 
that case involved a venue statute presenting significantly different concerns. See United States 
v. Morgan, 393 F.3d 192, 200 (D.C. Cir. 2004). The Supreme Court has likewise held that a 
statute which uses the language "an offense that . . . involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to 
the victim or victims exceeds $10,000" is "consistent with a circumstance-specific approach." 
Nijhawan v. Holder, 557 U.S. 29, 32, 38 (2009) (emphasis added). Thus, the word "involves" 
generally means that courts should look to the circumstances of an offense as committed in each 
case. This reading accords with a robust legislative history indicating that Congress intended to 
apply § 3283 to a wide range of crimes against children. See Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 60; 
Schneider, 801 F.3d at 196. 
The purposes underlying the categorical approach do not apply here either. For statutes 
dealing with prior convictions, "[t]he categorical approach serves `practical' purposes: It 
promotes judicial and administrative efficiency by precluding the relitigation of past convictions 
in minitrials conducted long after the fact." Moncrieffe v. Holder, 569 U.S. 184, 200-01 (2013). 
In the context of § 3283, there is no prior conviction to assess, and the jury will determine in the 
first instance whether "the defendant engaged in the applicable abusive conduct." Weingarten, 
II 
EFTA00029550
--- PAGE 12 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 208 Filed 04/16/21 Page 12 of 34 
865 F.3d at 60. Maxwell nonetheless contends that using a case-specific approach for § 3283 
would be impractical because the Government would need to prove conduct beyond the elements 
of the offense. It may be true that this approach requires the Government to prove some 
additional facts, but any statute-of-limitations defense presents factual issues (including, at least, 
when the alleged conduct took place). This is not a serious practical problem and does not 
justify setting aside the statute's language and apparent purpose. 
Maxwell relies primarily on Bridges v. United States, 346 U.S. 209 (1953), to urge this 
Court to cast Weingarten aside. The Supreme Court in Bridges addressed a statute that extended 
the limitations period for defrauding the United States during the Second World War. In that 
case, the Supreme Court first concluded that making false statements at an immigration hearing 
was not subject to the extended limitations period because it lacked any pecuniary element as 
required by the statute. Id. at 221. Then, as an alternative basis for its holding, it explained that 
the offense did not require fraud as an "essential ingredient." Id. at 222. It reached that 
conclusion in large part because the statute's legislative history made clear that Congress 
intended it to apply only to a narrow class of war frauds causing pecuniary loss. Id. at 216. 
As the Second Circuit explained in Weingarten, Congress had the opposite intent in the 
enacting in the PROTECT Act. Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 59 & n. 10. "In passing recent statutes 
related to child sex abuse, including extensions of the § 3283 limitations period, Congress 
'evinced a general intention to "'cast a wide net to ensnare as many offenses against children as 
possible."' Id. at 60 (quoting Schneider, 801 F.3d at 196 (quoting United States v. Dodge, 597 
F.3d 1347, 1355 (11th Cir. 2010) (en banc))). The primary basis for Bridges' holding—
legislative history supporting a narrow interpretation—does not exist here. Instead, both the 
statute's plan meaning and its legislative history suggest it should apply more broadly. 
EFTA00029551
--- PAGE 13 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 208 Filed 04/16/21 Page 13 of 34 
Based on the statute's text, context, and history, the Court follows Weingarten and 
concludes that the appropriate inquiry is whether the charged offenses involved the sexual abuse 
of a minor on the facts alleged in this case. There is no question that they did. The Court thus 
concludes that § 3283 governs the limitations period for the charges here. 
2. The 2003 amendment to the statute of I. 'cations applies to these offenses 
Maxwell next contends that because the charged conduct took place before the 
PROTECT Act's enactment, that statute did not lengthen the statute of limitations applicable to 
her alleged offenses. Here too, the Second Circuit has provided guidance in its decision in 
Weingarten. Although the court did not provide a definitive answer there, it explained that the 
view Maxwell now takes conflicts with established principles of retroactivity and the decisions 
of at least two other circuit courts. Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 58 & n.8; see Cruz v. Maypa, 773 
F.3d 138, 145 (4th Cir. 2014); United States v. Leo Sure Chief, 438 F.3d 920, 924 (9th Cir. 
2006). 
The Supreme Court has set out a two-step framework to determine whether a federal 
statute applies to past conduct. See Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U.S. 244, 280 (1994). 
Courts look first to the language of the statute. If the statute states that it applies to past conduct, 
courts must so apply it. Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 54. Otherwise, the statute applies to past 
conduct unless doing so would create impermissible retroactive effects. Id. 
The Court begins with Landgraf s first step. To assess a statute's meaning here, courts 
must consider the text of the statute along with other indicia of congressional intent, including 
the statute's history and structure. See Enter. Mortg. Acceptance Co., LLC, Sec. Litig. v. Enter. 
Mortg. Acceptance Co., 391 F.3d 401, 406 (2d Cir. 2004). 
EFTA00029552

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 208 Filed 04/16/21 Page 14 of 34 
Section 3283, as amended by the PROTECT Act, broadly states that InJo statute of 
limitations that would otherwise preclude prosecution for an offense involving the sexual or 
physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child under the age of 18 years shall preclude such prosecution 
during the life of the child." The statute lacks an express retroactivity clause, but courts have 
held that no such clause is necessary, including for this particular statute. See Leo Sure Chief, 
438 F.3d at 923. The statute's plain language unambiguously requires that it apply to 
prosecutions for offenses committed before the date of enactment. Instead of simply providing a 
new limitations period for future conduct, Congress stated that no statute of limitations that 
would otherwise preclude prosecution of these offenses will apply. That is, it prevents the 
application of any statute of limitations that would otherwise apply to past conduct. 
Courts have reached the same conclusion for other statutes employing similar language. 
The Eighth Circuit has held that the 1994 amendments to § 3283, which allowed prosecution of 
sex crimes against children until the victim reached age twenty-five, applied to past conduct. See 
United States v. Jeffries, 405 F.3d 682, 684-85 (8th Cir. 2005). The Second Circuit has observed 
that the Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-26, 105 Stat. 123, 
illustrates language that requires a statute's application to past conduct. See Enter. Mortg. 
Acceptance Co., LLC, Sec. Litig., 391 F.3d at 407. That statute eliminated the statute of 
limitations for claims on defaulted student loans by stating that "no limitation shall terminate the 
period within which suit may be filed." Id. The PROTECT Act's language is quite similar. 
The history of § 3283 confirms Congress's intent to apply the extended limitations period 
as broadly as the Constitution allows. With each successive amendment to the statute, Congress 
further extended the limitations period, recognizing that sex crimes against children "may be 
difficult to detect quickly" because children often delay or decline to report sexual abuse. 
EFTA00029553
--- PAGE 15 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 208 Filed 04/16/21 Page 15 of 34 
Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 54. Congress enacted the limitations provision of the PROTECT Act 
because it found the prior statute of limitations was "inadequate in many cases." H.R. Conf. 
Rep. No. 108-63, at 54 (2003). For example, a person who abducted and raped a child could not 
be prosecuted beyond this extended limit—even if DNA matching conclusively identified him as 
the perpetrator one day after the victim turned 25." Id. 
Maxwell makes no argument based on the statute's text. Instead, she contends that 
because the House version of the bill included an express retroactivity provision absent from its 
final form, the Court should infer that Congress did not intend the statute to apply to past 
conduct. However, the legislative history makes clear that Congress abandoned the retroactivity 
provision in the House bill only because it would have produced unconstitutional results. The 
Supreme Court has explained that a law that revives a time-barred prosecution violates the Ex 
Post Facto Clause of the Constitution, but a law that extends an un-expired statute of limitations 
does not. Stogner v. California, 539 U.S. 607, 632-33 (2003). Senator Leahy, who co-
sponsored the PROTECT Act, expressed concerns in a committee report that the proposed 
retroactivity provision was "of doubtful constitutionality" because it "would have revived the 
government's authority to prosecute crimes that were previously time-barred." 149 Cong. Rec. 
S5137, S5147 (Apr. 10, 2003) (statement of Sen. Leahy). Congress removed the provision 
shortly thereafter for this reason. The removal of the express retroactivity provision shows only 
that Congress intended to limit the PROTECT Act to its constitutional applications, including 
past conduct—like Maxwell's—on which the statute of limitations had not yet expired. 
Both the text and history of the PROTECT Act's amendment to § 3283 reflect that it 
applies Maxwell's conduct charged in the SI superseding indictment. The Court could stop here. 
EFTA00029554
--- PAGE 16 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 208 Filed 04/16/21 Page 16 of 34 
However, it also concludes that even if the statute were ambiguous, it would properly apply to 
these charges. 
At Lanfgraf s second step, the Court asks whether application of the statute to past 
conduct would have impermissible retroactive effects. "[A] statute has presumptively 
impermissible retroactive effects when it 'takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under 
existing laws, or creates a new obligation, imposes a new duty, or attaches a new disability, in 
respect to transactions or considerations already past.'" Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 56 (quoting 
Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 290). Thus, applying a new statute of limitations to previously time-
barred claims has an impermissible retroactive effect. Enter. Mortg. Acceptance Co., LLC, Sec. 
Litig., 391 F.3d at 407. Applying it to conduct for which the statute of limitations has not yet 
expired does not. Vernon v. Cassadaga Valley Cent. Sch. Dist., 49 F.3d 886, 890 (2d Cir. 1995). 
Maxwell concedes that these offenses were within the statute of limitations when 
Congress enacted the PROTECT Act. Thus, the Act did not deprive her of any vested rights. 
Maxwell contends that it is unfair to allow the Government to prosecute her now for conduct that 
occurred more than twenty years ago, but there is no dispute that Congress has the power to set a 
lengthy limitations period or no limitations period at all. It has done so here, judging that the 
difficulty of prosecuting these offenses and the harm they work on children outweighs a 
defendant's interest in repose. Maxwell's fairness argument is a gripe with Congress's policy 
judgment, not an impermissibly retroactive application of the statute. The Court concludes that 
§ 3283 allows her prosecution now. 
B. The Government's delay in bringing charges did not violate due process 
"As the Supreme Court stated in United States v. Marion, the statute of limitations is 'the 
primary guarantee against bringing overly stale criminal charges."' United States v. Condelle, 
EFTA00029555
--- PAGE 17 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 208 Filed 04/16/21 Page 17 of 34 
171 F.3d 748, 751 (2d Cir. 1999) (cleaned up) (quoting United States v. Marion, 404 U.S. 307, 
322 (1971)). There is a strong presumption that an indictment filed within the statute of 
limitations is valid. To prevail on a claim that pre-indictment delay violates due process, a 
defendant must show both that the Government intentionally delayed bringing charges for an 
improper purpose and that the delay seriously damaged the defendant's ability defend against the 
charges. See id. This is a stringent standard. "Thus, while the [Supreme] Court may not have 
shut the door firmly on a contention that at some point the Due Process Clause forecloses 
prosecution of a claim because it is too old, at most the door is barely ajar." DeMichele v. 
Greenburgh Cent. Sch. Dist. No. 7, 167 F.3d 784, 790-91 (2d Cir. 1999). 
The Court sees no evidence that the Government's delay in bringing these charges was 
designed to thwart Maxwell's ability to prepare a defense. However, it is enough to say that 
Maxwell does not make the strong showing of prejudice required to support this sort of claim. 
Maxwell contends that the Government's delay in bringing charges has prejudiced her interests 
because potential witnesses have died, others have forgotten, and records have been lost or 
destroyed. It is highly speculative that any of these factors would make a substantial difference 
in her case. 
Maxwell first points to several potential witnesses who have passed away. These include 
Jeffrey Epstein and his mother, one individual Maxwell believes worked with one of the alleged 
victims in this case, and a police detective who investigated Epstein in Florida. She contends 
they all would have provided exculpatory testimony were they alive today. Courts have 
generally found that vague assertions that a deceased witness might have provided favorable 
testimony do not justify dismissing an indictment for delay. See, e.g., United States v. Scala, 388 
F. Supp. 2d 396, 399-400 (S.D.N.Y. 2005). The Court agrees with this approach. Maxwell 
EFTA00029556
--- PAGE 18 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 208 Filed 04/16/21 Page 18 of 34 
provides no indication of what many of these potential witnesses might have testified to. The 
testimony she suggests the detective might have offered—that witnesses in the Palm Beach 
investigation did not identify Maxwell by name—is propensity evidence that does nothing to 
establish her innocence of the charged offenses. There are also serious doubts under all of the 
relevant circumstances that a jury would have found testimony from Epstein credible even if he 
had waived his right against self-incrimination and testified on her behalf. See United States v. 
Spears, 159 F.3d 1081, 1085 (7th Cir. 1999). 
Maxwell's arguments that the indictment should be dismissed because of the possibility 
of missing witnesses, failing memories, or lost records fail for similar reasons. These are 
difficulties that arise in any case where there is extended delay in bringing a prosecution, and 
they do not justify dismissing an indictment. United States v. Marion, 404 U.S. 307, 325-26 
(1971); see United States v. Elsbery, 602 F.2d 1054, 1059 (2d Cir. 1979). 
Finally, the Court finds no substantial prejudice from the pretrial publicity this case has 
garnered. Maxwell contends that lengthy public interest in this case has transformed her 
reputation from that of Epstein's friend to a co-conspirator. And she also alleges—without 
evidence—that her accusers fabricated their stories based on media allegations. The Court will 
not dismiss the indictment on Maxwell's bare assertion that numerous witnesses are engaged in a 
perjurious conspiracy against her. And the Court will take all appropriate steps to ensure that the 
pretrial publicity in this case does not compromise Maxwell's right to a fair and impartial jury. 
The Court thus concludes that Maxwell has failed to establish actual prejudice from the 
Government's delay in bringing charges. She may renew her motion if the factual record at trial 
shows otherwise. On the present record, neither the applicable statute of limitations nor due 
process bars the charges here. 
EFTA00029557

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 208 Filed 04/16/21 Page 19 of 34 
III. 
The indictment describes the charged offenses with specificity 
Maxwell seeks to dismiss the Mann Act counts for lack of specificity or in the alternative 
to compel the Government to submit a bill of particulars providing greater detail of the charges. 
The Court concludes that the charges in the SI superseding indictment are clear enough. 
Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7, an indictment must contain "a plain, 
concise, and definite written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged." 
The indictment must be specific enough to inform the defendant of the charges and allow the 
defendant to plead double jeopardy in a later prosecution based on the same events. United 
States v. Stavrouiakis, 952 F.2d 686, 693 (2d Cir. 1992). "Under this test, an indictment need do 
little more than to track the language of the statute charged and state the time and place (in 
approximate terms) of the alleged crime." United States. v. Tramunti, 513 F.2d 1087, 1113 (2d 
Cir. 1975). In addition to dismissal, "Rule 7(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 
permits a defendant to seek a bill of particulars in order to identify with sufficient particularity 
the nature of the charge pending against him, thereby enabling defendant to prepare for trial, to 
prevent surprise, and to interpose a plea of double jeopardy should he be prosecuted a second 
time for the same offense." United States v. Bortnovsky, 820 F.2d 572, 574 (2d Cir. 1987). 
The SI superseding indictment sets out the elements of each charged crime and the facts 
supporting each element. Nonetheless, Maxwell contends that the indictment is too vague 
because it refers to open-ended time periods, describes conduct like "grooming" and 
"befriending" that is not inherently criminal, and does not identify the alleged victims by name. 
Maxwell's first argument fails because the Government need only describe the time and 
place of charged conduct "in approximate terms." Tramunti, 513 F.2d at 1113. The details are 
subject to proof at trial. "[T]he Second Circuit routinely upholds the 'on or about' language used 
EFTA00029558
--- PAGE 20 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 208 Filed 04/16/21 Page 20 of 34 
to describe the window of when a violation occurred." United States v. Kidd, 386 F. Supp. 3d 
364, 369 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (quoting United States v. Nersesian, 824 F.2d 1294, 1323 (2d Cir. 
1987)). "This is especially true in cases of sexual abuse of children: allegations of sexual abuse 
of underage victims often proceed without specific dates of the offenses." United States v. 
Young, No. 08-cr-285 (KMK), 2008 WL 4178190, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 4, 2008) (collecting 
cases). As here, these cases frequently involve alleged abuse spanning a lengthy period of time, 
and witnesses who were victimized as children may struggle to recall the precise dates when 
abuse occurred. The indictment adequately describes the time and place of the charged conduct. 
Maxwell next contends that allegations of noncriminal conduct render the charges 
impermissibly vague. The Court disagrees. Rule 7 requires only that the language of the 
indictment track the language of the statute and provide a rough account of the time and place of 
the crime. Tramunti, 513 F.2d at 1113. The language of the Si superseding indictment does so. 
The Government's decision to provide more details than those strictly required does not hamper 
Maxwell's ability to prepare a defense. Maxwell's argument that some of the conduct alleged is 
not inherently criminal goes to the merits of the Government's case, not the specificity of the 
charges. 
Finally, Maxwell argues that the indictment is vague because the government does not 
provide the names of the alleged victims. The Court sees no basis to require that the alleged 
victims' names be included the indictment. The names of victims, even if important, generally 
need not appear there unless their omission would seriously prejudice the defendant. See United 
States v. Stringer, 730 F.3d 120, 127 (2d Cir. 2013); United States v. Kidd, 386 F. Supp. 3d 364, 
369 (S.D.N.Y. 2019). Maxwell likely knows the identity of the alleged victims described in the 
indictment at this point because the Government has provided extensive discovery on them. 
EFTA00029559
--- PAGE 21 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 208 Filed 04/16/21 Page 21 of 34 
Moreover, the Government has agreed to disclose their names in advance of trial. There is thus 
no unfairness here. See Stringer, 730 F.3d at 126. As discussed below, the Court will require 
the parties to negotiate and propose a full schedule for all remaining pretrial disclosures. 
IV. 
The perjury charges are legally tenable 
The Court turns next to Maxwell's motion to dismiss the perjury counts stemming from 
her answers to questions in a deposition in a civil case. She contends that these charges are 
legally deficient because the questions posed were fundamentally ambiguous and the questions 
were not material to the subject of the deposition. The Court concludes that the charges are 
legally tenable and Maxwell's defenses are appropriately left to the jury. 
The applicable perjury statute imposes criminal penalties on anyone who "in any 
proceeding before or ancillary to any court ... knowingly makes any false material declaration." 
U.S.C. § 1623(a). Testimony is perjurious only if it is knowingly false and is material to the 
proceeding in which the defendant offered it. 
A. The questions posed were not too ambiguous to support a perjury charge 
The requirement of knowing falsity requires that a witness believe that their testimony is 
false. United States v. Lighte, 782 F.2d 367, 372 (2d Cir. 1986). As a general matter, "[a] jury is 
best equipped to determine the meaning that a defendant assigns to a specific question." Id. 
Courts have acknowledged a narrow exception for questions that are so fundamentally 
ambiguous or imprecise that the answer to them cannot legally be false. Id. at 372, 375; see also 
United States v. Wolfson, 437 F.2d 862, 878 (2d Cir. 1970). A question is fundamentally 
ambiguous only if reasonable people could not agree on its meaning in context. Lighte, 782 F.2d 
at 375. The existence of some arguable ambiguity does not foreclose a perjury charge against a 
witness who understood the question. 
EFTA00029560
--- PAGE 22 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 208 Filed 04/16/21 Page 22 of 34 
At a minimum, Maxwell's motion is premature. Courts typically evaluate whether a 
question was fundamentally ambiguous only after the development of a full factual record at 
trial. See, e.g., United States v. Markiewicz, 978 F.2d 786, 808 (2d Cir. 1992). The evidence at 
trial may shed further light on whether the questions posed were objectively ambiguous in 
context or whether Maxwell subjectively understood them. In any event, the Court has closely 
considered each of the categories of questions that Maxwell argues are ambiguous. None of the 
alleged ambiguities Maxwell identifies rise to the level supporting dismissal of the charges. The 
context of the questions and answers, in conjunction with the Government's evidence, could lead 
a reasonable juror to conclude that the statements were perjurious. Truth and falsity are 
questions for the jury in all but the most extreme cases. The Court declines to usurp the jury's 
role on the limited pretrial record. 
B. A reasonable juror could conclude that Maxwell's statements were material 
Maxwell also argues that the perjury counts should be dismissed because none of the 
allegedly false statements were material to the defamation action. In a civil deposition, a 
statement is material if it has a natural tendency to influence the court or if a truthful answer 
might reasonably lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. United States v. Gaudin, 515 
U.S. 506, 509 (1995); United States v. Kross, 14 F.3d 751, 753-54 (2d Cir. 1994). Like knowing 
falsity, materiality is an element of the offense and thus ordinarily must be "decided by the jury, 
not the court." Johnson v. United States, 520 U.S. 461, 465 (1997). Only the most extraordinary 
circumstances justify departure from this general rule. United States v. Forde, 740 F. Supp. 2d 
406, 412 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (citing Gaudin, 515 U.S. at 522-23). 
The charged statements do not fall within this narrow exception. Maxwell contends that 
the questions did not relate to the sex trafficking and sexual abuse allegations at the center of the 
EFTA00029561
--- PAGE 23 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 208 Filed 04/16/21 Page 23 of 34 
civil case, but that is not the legal standard. The Government may prevail if it proves that 
Maxwell's answers could have led to the discovery of other evidence or could influence the 
factfinder in the civil case. See Gaudin, 515 U.S. at 509; Kross, 14 F.3d at 753-54. At trial, a 
reasonable juror could conclude that truthful answers to the questions may have permitted the 
plaintiff to locate other victims or witnesses who could have corroborated the plaintiff's 
testimony. The factual disputes relating to materiality are at least enough to preclude pretrial 
resolution. In criminal cases, courts must guard against "invading the 'inviolable function of the 
jury' in our criminal justice system," and if the "defense raises a factual dispute that is 
inextricably intertwined with a defendant's potential culpability, a judge cannot resolve that 
dispute on a Rule 12(b) motion." United States v. Sampson, 898 F.3d 270, 281 (2d Cir. 2018). 
The Court concludes that the perjury charges are legally tenable and appropriately 
presented to the jury. 
V. 
The perjury charges must be severed and tried separately 
Although the perjury charges are legally tenable, the Court concludes that the interests of 
justice require severing those counts and trying them separately. Trying the perjury counts 
together with the Mann Act counts would require admitting evidence of other acts likely to be 
unduly prejudicial. It would also risk disqualifying Maxwell's chosen counsel based on their 
involvement in the earlier civil case. 
Rule 14(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure allows a court to order separate 
trials if joining all offenses in a single trial would prejudice the defendant. A defendant seeking 
severance must show significant unfairness to outweigh the burden on the court of conducting 
multiple trials. United States v. Walker, 142 F.3d 103, 110 (2d Cir. 1998). The harm to the 
defendant must be more than "solely the adverse effect of being tried for two crimes rather than 
EFTA00029562
--- PAGE 24 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 208 Filed 04/16/21 Page 24 of 34 
one." United States v. Werner, 620 F.2d 922, 929 (2d Cir. 1980). Though this standard is 
demanding, the Court concludes that, due to unique features of the perjury counts, Maxwell 
meets it here. Trying all counts together would compromise Maxwell's right to the counsel of 
her choice and risk an unfair trial. 
Trying the perjury counts together with the Mann Act counts would risk an unfair trial on 
each set of counts. First, it would introduce unrelated allegations of sexual abuse, which would 
potentially expose the jury to evidence that might otherwise not be admissible. In particular, a 
joint trial would potentially expose the jury to a wider swath of information regarding civil 
litigation against Epstein that is remote from Maxwell's charged conduct. This presents a 
significant risk that the jury will cumulate the evidence of the various crimes charged and find 
guilt when, if considered separately, it would not do so. See United States v. Halper, 590 F.2d 
422, 430 (2d Cir. 1978). Second, the evidence presented on the Mann Act counts may prejudice 
the jury's ability to fairly evaluate Maxwell's truthfulness in her deposition, a critical element of 
the perjury counts. The Court has concerns that a limiting instruction may be inadequate to 
mitigate these risks given the nature of the allegations involved. 
Importantly, a joint trial is also likely to require disqualification of at least one of 
Maxwell's attorneys from participating as an advocate on her behalf. The perjury counts likely 
implicate the performance and credibility of her lawyers in the civil action—two of whom 
represent her in this case. The New York Rules of Professional Conduct generally forbid a 
lawyer from representing a client in a proceeding in which the lawyer is likely also to be a 
witness. N.Y. R. Prof 'I Conduct § 3.7(a). Maxwell's counsel in the civil action and the 
deposition may be important fact witnesses on the perjury counts. Even if counsel were not 
required to testify, trying all counts together could force Maxwell to choose between having her 
EFTA00029563
--- PAGE 25 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 208 Filed 04/16/21 Page 25 of 34 
counsel testify on her behalf on the perjury charges and having them assist her in defending the 
Mann Act charges. 
The Second Circuit has recognized that witness testimony offered by a party's attorney 
presents serious risks to the fairness of a trial. See Murray v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 583 F.3d 173, 
178 (2d Cir. 2009). The lawyer might appear to vouch for their own credibility, jurors might 
perceive the lawyer as distorting the truth to benefit their client, and blurred lines between 
argument and evidence might confuse the jury. Id. Disqualification of counsel also implicates 
Maxwell's Sixth Amendment right to be represented by the counsel of her choice. See, e.g., 
United States v. Kincade, No. 15-cr-00071 (JAD) (GWF), 2016 WL 6154901, at *6 (D. Nev. 
Oct. 21, 2016). The prejudice to Maxwell is especially pronounced because the attorneys who 
represented her in the civil case have worked with her for years and are particularly familiar with 
the facts surrounding the criminal prosecution. See United States v. Cunningham, 672 F.2d 
1064, 1070-71 (2d Cir. 1982). 
The Court is of course cognizant of the burden separate trials may impose on all trial 
participants. But much of the proof relevant to the perjury counts and the Mann Act counts does 
not overlap. In particular, materiality for statements made in a civil deposition is broad, and 
evidence on that question is unlikely to bear on the other charges here. See Kross, 14 F.3d at 
753-54; Gaudin, 515 U.S. at 509. Although some allegations of sexual abuse are relevant to 
both sets of charges, many are not. At a minimum, this will expand the scope of the trial far 
beyond the narrower issues presented. And while the Court agrees with the Government that at 
least some of Maxwell's concerns are overstated, there is little question that the jury's 
consideration of the nature of the defamation action will require a significant investment of time 
and resources to provide the requisite context. 
EFTA00029564
--- PAGE 26 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 208 Filed 04/16/21 Page 26 of 34 
The balance of these considerations favors severance. "Motions to sever are committed 
to the sound discretion of the trial judge." United States v. Casarnento, 887 F.2d 1141, 1149 (2d 
Cir. 1989). In its discretion, the Court concludes that trying the perjury counts separately will 
best ensure a fair and expeditious resolution of all charges in this case. 
VI. 
Maxwell's motion to strike surplusage is premature 
Maxwell moves to strike allegations related to one of the alleged victims from the S I 
superseding indictment as surplusage. The Court declines to do so at this juncture. 
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(d) allows a court to strike surplusage from an 
indictment on a defendant's motion. "Motions to strike surplusage from an indictment will be 
granted only where the challenged allegations are not relevant to the crime charged and are 
inflammatory and prejudicial." United States v. Hernandez, 85 F.3d 1023, 1030 (2d Cir. 1996) 
(cleaned up). Courts in this District generally delay ruling on any motion to strike until after the 
presentation of the Government's evidence at trial, because that evidence may affect how 
specific allegations relate to the overall charges. See, e.g., United States v. Nejad, No. I 8-cr-224 
(MN), 2019 WL 6702361, at *18 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 6, 2019); United States v. Mostafa, 965 F. 
Supp. 2d 451, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 2013). 
Maxwell contends that the allegations related to "Minor Victim-3" are surplusage 
because the indictment does not charge that Minor Victim-3 traveled in interstate commerce or 
was below the age of consent in England where the alleged activities took place. Thus, she 
argues, these allegations do not relate to the charged conspiracy and instead reflect an attempt to 
introduce Minor Victim-3's testimony for impermissible purposes. 
The Court will not strike any language from the S 1 superseding indictment at this 
juncture. The standard under Rule 7(d) is "exacting" and requires the defendant to demonstrate 
EFTA00029565
--- PAGE 27 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 208 Filed 04/16/21 Page 27 of 34 
clearly that the allegations are irrelevant to the crimes charged. United States v. Napolitano, 552 
F. Supp. 465, 480 (S.D.N.Y. 1982). The indictment does not allege that the alleged victim 
traveled in interstate commerce or was underage during sexual encounters with Epstein. But the 
Court cannot rule out that the allegations may reflect conduct undertaken in furtherance of the 
charged conspiracy or be relevant to prove facts such as Maxwell's state of mind. See United 
States v. Concepcion, 983 F.2d 369, 392 (2d Cir. 1992). The Court will follow the well-worn 
path of others in this District and reserve the issue for trial. Maxwell may renew her motion 
then. 
VII. 
Maxwell's motion to dismiss multiplicitous charges is premature 
Maxwell's motion to dismiss either the first or third count of the SI superseding 
indictment as multiplicitous is also premature. Maxwell contends that the Government has 
alleged the same conspiracy twice in the indictment. "An indictment is multiplicitous when it 
charges a single offense as an offense multiple times, in separate counts, when, in law and fact, 
only one crime has been committed." United States v. Chacko, 169 F.3d 140, 145 (2d Cir. 1999). 
"The multiplicity doctrine is based upon the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment, 
which assures that the court does not exceed its legislative authorization by imposing multiple 
punishments for the same offense." United States v. Nakashian, 820 F.2d 549, 552 (2d Cir. 1987) 
(cleaned up). 
"Where there has been no prior conviction or acquittal, the Double Jeopardy Clause does 
not protect against simultaneous prosecutions for the same offense, so long as no more than one 
punishment is eventually imposed." United States v. Josephberg, 459 F.3d 350, 355 (2d Cir. 
2006). "Since Josephberg, courts in this Circuit have routinely denied pre-trial motions to 
dismiss potentially multiplicitous counts as premature." United States v. Medina, No. 13-cr-272 
EFTA00029566
--- PAGE 28 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 208 Filed 04/16/21 Page 28 of 34 
(PGG), 2014 WL 3057917, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. July 7, 2014) (collecting cases). The Court therefore 
denies Maxwell's motion to dismiss multiplicitous counts without prejudice. 
VIII. The parties shall negotiate all remaining disclosures 
Maxwell moves to compel the Government to produce certain documents she believes it 
has in its possession and has failed to produce. She also seeks accelerated disclosure of the 
Government's witness list, Jencks Act material, Brady and Giglio material, co-conspirator 
statements, and Rule 404(b) material. Based on the Government's response in briefing and 
letters the parties have since submitted to the Court, it appears that most of these requests have 
been overtaken by events. Accordingly, although the Court concludes that Maxwell is not 
entitled to expedite this discovery based on the arguments in her motion papers, the Court will 
require the parties to confer on an overall schedule for all remaining pretrial disclosures. 
A. The Court accepts the Government's representations that it has disclosed all 
Brady and Giglio Material 
The Supreme Court's decisions in Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963) and Giglio v. 
United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972) require the Government to disclose to defendants certain 
evidence that will aid their defense. Brady requires disclosure of exculpatory evidence. Under 
Giglio, the Government has a duty to produce "not only exculpatory material, but also 
information that could be used to impeach a key government witness." United States v. Coppa, 
267 F.3d 132, 135 (2d Cir. 2001) (citing Giglio, 405 U.S. at 154). As a general rule, "Brady and 
its progeny do not require immediate disclosure of all exculpatory and impeachment material 
upon request by a defendant." Id. at 146. "[A]s long as a defendant possesses Brady evidence in 
time for its effective use, the government has not deprived the defendant of due process of law 
simply because it did not produce the evidence sooner." Id. at 144. 
EFTA00029567
--- PAGE 29 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 208 Filed 04/16/21 Page 29 of 34 
Maxwell requests an order directing immediate disclosure of all Brady and Giglio 
material and also requests a few specific documents she contends the Government has failed to 
disclose. The Court begins with the specific requests. The requested materials include (1) 
records of witness interviews in connection with an ex parte declaration in support of a response 
to a motion to quash subpoenas; (2) an unredacted copy of two FBI reports; (3) pages from a 
personal diary that is in the custody of a civilian third party; and (4) copies of all subpoenas the 
Government has issued for Maxwell's records as part of its investigation in this case. 
The Government represents that it is cognizant of its Brady obligations, that is has 
reviewed the witness interviews and one of the FBI reports, and that neither set of documents 
includes exculpatory information not previously disclosed. The Court has no reason to doubt the 
Government's representation in this case that it is aware of its Brady obligations and that it has 
complied and will continue to comply with them. And because the witness statements are 
covered by the Jencks Act, the Court cannot compel production of such statements under the 
terms of the statute. See 18 U.S.C. § 3500; Coppa, 267 F.3d at 145. Next, the Government 
represents that it has already produced an unredacted copy of the other requested FBI report, and 
so that request is moot. The diary pages she requests are within the control of a civilian third 
party, not the Government, and so the Government need not (and perhaps cannot) produce them. 
See United States v. Collins, 409 F. Supp. 3d 228, 239 (S.D.N.Y. 2019). Finally, Maxwell's 
request for copies of all subpoenas the Government has issued is overly broad and lacks a legal 
basis. Maxwell is not entitled to compel production of these documents. 
The Court also will not issue an order requiring the immediate disclosure of Brady and 
Giglio material. The Government has represented that it recognizes its obligations under Brady 
and that it has complied, and will continue to comply, with such obligations. The Court has no 
EFTA00029568
--- PAGE 30 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 208 Filed 04/16/21 Page 30 of 34 
reason to doubt these representations given its expansive approach to document production thus 
far in this case. The Government has agreed in its recent letter to produce Giglio material six 
weeks in advance of trial. The parties shall negotiate the specific timing, but assuming a 
schedule along those lines is met, the Court concludes that Maxwell will be able to effectively 
prepare for trial. See Coppa, 267 F.3d at 144. 
B. Jencks Act material and co-conspirator statements 
Maxwell also seeks to expedite discovery of Jencks Act material and non-exculpatory 
statements of co-conspirators that the government may offer at trial. The Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. 
§ 3500, "provides that no prior statement made by a government witness shall be the subject of 
discovery until that witness has testified on direct examination." Coppa, 267 F.3d at 145. The 
statute therefore prohibits a district court in most cases from ordering the pretrial disclosure of 
witness statements unless those statements are exculpatory. "A coconspirator who testifies on 
behalf of the government is a witness under the Act." In re United States, 834 F.2d 283, 286 (2d 
Cir. 1987). The Court therefore lacks the inherent power to expedite these disclosures. In any 
case, the Government has agreed to produce all Jencks Act material at least six weeks in advance 
of trial. 
The Court also rejects Maxwell's alternative request for a hearing to determine the 
admissibility of co-conspirator declarations. Co-conspirator statements may often be admitted at 
trial on a conditional basis. If the Court determines that the Government has not met its burden 
to show that the conditionally admitted statements were made in furtherance of the charged 
conspiracy, the Court should provide a limiting instruction or, in extreme cases declare a 
mistrial. United States v. Tracy, 12 F.3d 1186, 1199 (2d Cir. 1993). Although conditional 
admissions can pose a problem, a pretrial hearing is unnecessary here because the Government 
EFTA00029569
--- PAGE 31 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 208 Filed 04/16/21 Page 31 of 34 
has committed to producing co-conspirator statements at least six weeks in advance of trial to 
allow Maxwell to raise any objections. Maxwell will have adequate time to object to any 
proffered co-conspirator testimony following the Government's Jencks Act disclosures. 
C. Witness list 
As a general matter, "district courts have authority to compel pretrial disclosure of the 
identity of government witnesses." United States v. Cannon, 528 F.2d 296, 300 (2d Cir. 1975). 
In deciding whether to order accelerated disclosure of a witness list, courts consider whether a 
defendant has made a specific showing that disclosure is "both material to the preparation of the 
defense and reasonable in light of the circumstances surrounding the case." United States v. 
Bejasa, 904 F.2d 137, 139-140 (2d Cir. 1990) (cleaned up). 
Maxwell has made a particularized showing that the Government must produce a witness 
list reasonably in advance of trial. The nature of the allegations in this case—decades-old 
allegations spanning multiple locations—present considerable challenges for the preparation of 
the defense. However, the Government's proposed disclosure schedule—which will afford 
Maxwell at least six weeks to investigate testifying witness statements—allows Maxwell 
significantly more time to review disclosures than schedules adopted in most cases in this 
District. See, e.g., United States v. Rueb, No. 00-CR-91 (RWS), 2001 WL 96177, at *9 
(S.D.N.Y. Feb. 5, 2001) (thirty days before trial); United States v. Nachamie, 91 F. Supp. 2d 565, 
580 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (fourteen days before trial). In addition, on April 13, 2021, the 
Government produced over 20,000 pages of interview notes, reports and other materials related 
to non-testifying witnesses. After considering the circumstances, including the complexity of the 
issues in this case and what the defense has already received and likely learned in the course of 
discovery, the Court concludes that the Government's proposal is generally reasonable. 
EFTA00029570
--- PAGE 32 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 208 Filed 04/16/21 Page 32 of 34 
D. Rule 404(b) material 
Maxwell's final discovery request is for early disclosure of evidence the Government 
seeks to offer under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(6). Under Rule 4O4(b), if the prosecutor in a 
criminal case intends to use "evidence of a crime, wrong, or other act" against a defendant, the 
prosecutor must "provide reasonable notice of the general nature of any such evidence that the 
prosecutor intends to offer at trial" and must "do so in writing before trial—or in any form 
during trial if the court, for good cause, excuses lack of pretrial notice." The Government 
represents that it will notify the defense of its intent to use 404(b) evidence at least 45 days in 
advance of trial to allow Maxwell to file any motions in limine to be considered at the final 
pretrial conference. The Government's proposal will give Maxwell an opportunity to challenge 
admission of that evidence and to bring to the Court's attention any issues that require resolution 
before trial. "This is all that Rule 404(b) requires." United States v. Thompson, No. 13-cr-378 
(MN), 2013 WL 6246489, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3, 2013). The Court concludes this schedule is 
generally reasonable, although additional time to enable briefing and resolution in advance of 
trial is strongly encouraged. 
The Court's denial of Maxwell's requests to compel pretrial disclosures does not preclude 
the parties from negotiating in good faith for an expedited discovery timeline that will account 
for Maxwell's specific concerns. "[I]n most criminal cases, pretrial disclosure will redound to 
the benefit of all parties, counsel, and the court." United States v. Percevault, 490 F.2d 126, 132 
(2d Cir. 1974). In general, the Court will require the parties to negotiate a final, omnibus 
schedule to propose to the Court. The Court concludes that the disclosure of all of the above 
materials approximately six to eight weeks in advance of trial is appropriate and sufficient. 
EFTA00029571
--- PAGE 33 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 208 Filed 04/16/21 Page 33 of 34 
Given the complexities of the case and the addition of two counts via the S2 indictment, the 
Court encourages the parties to agree to approximately eight weeks. 
IX. 
The S2 superseding indictment moots Maxwell's grand jury challenge 
The Court has not received supplemental briefing on the motions in light of the return of 
the S2 superseding indictment and so does resolve any such issues here.' However, Maxwell's 
motion seeking to dismiss the Si superseding indictment because it was returned by a grand jury 
sitting at the White Plains courthouse appears moot. Maxwell argued that the use of a grand jury 
drawn from the White Plains Division in this District did not represent a fair cross-section of the 
community, because her trial would proceed in the Manhattan Division. A grand jury sitting in 
Manhattan returned the S2 superseding indictment. By April 21, 2021, Maxwell shall show 
cause why her grand jury motion should not be dismissed on that basis. 
Conclusion 
The Court DENIES Maxwell's motions to dismiss the indictment as barred by Epstein's 
non-prosecution agreement (Dkt. No. 141), to dismiss the Mann Act counts as barred by the 
statute of limitations (Dkt. No. 143), to dismiss the indictment for pre-indictment delay (Dkt. No. 
137), to dismiss the Mann Act counts for lack of specificity (Dkt. No. 123), to dismiss the 
perjury counts as legally untenable (Dkt. No. 135), to strike surplusage (Dkt. No. 145), to 
dismiss count one or count three as multiplicitous (Dkt. No. 121), and to expedite pretrial 
disclosures (Dkt. No. 147). The Court GRANTS Maxwell's motion to sever the perjury counts 
for a separate trial (Dkt. No. 119). 
' The parties shall negotiate and propose a schedule for any available additional or supplement rulings in 
light of the filing of the S2 indictment. 
EFTA00029572

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 208 Filed 04/16/21 Page 34 of 34 
The Court ORDERS the Government to confirm within one week whether it considers 
any evidence related to negotiation of the non-prosecution agreement to constitute Brady or Rule 
material and, if so, to confirm that it has or will disclose such evidence. 
The Court further ORDERS the parties to negotiate a final schedule for all pretrial 
disclosures that remain outstanding, including: Brady, Giglio, and Jenks Act materials, including 
co-conspirator statements; non-testifying witness statements; testifying witness statements; the 
identity of victims alleged in the indictment; 404(b) material; and the Government's witness list. 
The Court also requires the parties to negotiate a schedule for any additional or supplemental 
motions briefing in light of the S2 indictment. The Court ORDERS a joint proposal to be 
submitted by April 21, 2021. If agreement is not reached, the parties shall submit their 
respective proposals. 
The Court further ORDERS Maxwell to show cause by April 21, 2021 why her motion to 
dismiss the SI superseding indictment under the Sixth Amendment (Dkt. No. 125) should not be 
denied as moot. 
SO ORDERED.

PRESS GUIDANCE 
Tuesday, November 23, 2021 
*OFF-THE-RECORD,  AND FOR GUIDANCE ONLY: Several of the government's anticipated witnesses 
will be testifying in this trial using a pseudonym or first name. The Court granted a Government motion 
[attached] requesting that they be able to do so, because the victim witnesses are expected to describe alleged 
sensitive, explicit and personal events concerning illegal sexual abuse, sexual contact and other acts of which 
they have been victims. I believe most, if not all, news media outlets have a policy against identifying sex 
crime victims without their consent, and urge you to abide by that policy with our witnesses and respect their 
privacy. 
9:30 a.m. — Final pretrial conference U.S. v. Ghislaine Maxwell — the defendant is charged in connection to 
conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein to entice minors to travel to engage in criminal sexual activity — before Judge 
Alison Nathan (Courtroom 318, 40 Foley Square [overflow Courtrooms 110, 506, 905, and 906 of the Thurgood

Foley Square 
New York, NY 10007 
Re: 
United States v. Avenatti, No. Si 19 Cr. 373 (PGGI 
Letter Concerning Mr. Avenatti's Prison Conditions 
Dear Judge Gardephe: 
201 S. Bisaynt Boulevard 
Suite 1210 
Miami. Florida 33131 
Tab 305-2819019 
Fax: 305-377-9937

We write to inform the Court of Mr. Avenatti's conditions as a pretrial detainee and to 
request that the Court inquire into his custody status and direct the Bureau of Prisons to 
consider his immediate removal to general population. 
Under Mr. Avenatti's current 
conditions of confinement, we cannot effectively prepare for trial and Mr. Avenatti cannot 
meaningfully assist in his defense. 
As the Court is aware, Mr. Avenatti was remanded into custody last week, at the request 
of the United States Attorney for the Central District of California, on the theory that Mr. 
Avenatti violated his bail conditions in the CDCA because of financial transactions that 
prompted the prosecutors there to claim that he was an "economic danger." There was no 
allegation that Mr. Avenatti was a risk of flight or that he posed a physical danger to anyone 
or to himself. 
On Friday, January 17, 2020, after spending three nights in the Santa Ana jail, under 
solitary confinement conditions, Mr. Avenatti was flown from California to New York. Since 
then, he has been housed in the Special Housing Unit on the notorious 10-South of the MCC-
New York. It is the most secure floor in the entire facility. He is in a cell reportedly once 
occupied by El Chapo, on a floor that houses individuals charged with terrorism offenses. He 
is apparently under special administrative measures (SAMs), which almost completely 
restricts his communications with the outside world. He has been locked down for 24 hours a 
day, in solitary confinement, except for attorney visits and two medical exams. There is an 
officer outside his cell 24 hours a day and two cameras focused on him. Mr. Avenatti was 
permitted two social calls upon arriving at the facility, but none since. He was told that his 
classification entitles him to one pre-scheduled social call per month. The temperature in his 
cell feels like it is in the mid-40s. He is forced to sleep with three blankets. Not surprisingly, 
he has been having great difficulty functioning. He has not been permitted to shave. We do 
not know the reason why he has been confuted in the SITU, under SAMs. 
EFTA00029584
--- PAGE 2 ---
Case 1:19-cr-00373-PGG Document 176 Filed 01/20/20 Page 2 of 3 
Upon learning that Mr. Avenatti had been moved to MCC-New York, undersigned 
counsel (Scott Srebnick) traveled to New York early Saturday morning (January 18). That 
afternoon, Ms. Perry and I visited Mr. Avenatti at the facility. We arrived at 2pm and left just 
before 7pm. We were required to visit with him in the SHU, not in the legal visiting room on 
the third floor. The visit was a non-contact legal visit, which means we communicated with 
Mr. Avenatti through a partition that was part screen / part glass. We were told that such was 
the protocol of the Special Housing Unit. There was no opening in the glass/screen partition 
for us to hand Mr. Avenatti documents to review, or for him to make notes on a document, and 
we were not authorized to do so in any event. Although the officers allowed Mr. Avenatti to 
review a document at our request at the beginning of our visit, if we wanted him to review any 
additional documents, it would have required us to disturb the busy officers and have them 
repeatedly transfer documents back and forth. That was untenable.' While we were told that 
certain accommodations can be made for inmates in the SHU — at the discretion of legal staff 
— we were told that legal staff would not return until Tuesday, January 21 (after the holiday), 
so that no meaningful changes could be made until then (at the earliest). 
On Saturday night, I communicated with government counsel regarding Mr. Avenatti's 
situation and have been in regular communication with government counsel throughout the 
weekend and today. While government counsel have made several inquiries at my request to 
determine whether any accommodations could be made in the interim, the bottom line is that 
his conditions have not changed.2 I visited with Mr. Avenatti on Sunday and again today, both 
times for several hours. Reviewing documents together through the partition is challenging to 
say the least. It takes many times longer to review documents and make decisions. Needless 
to say, Mr. Avenatti wants to have an active role in his own defense. That is simply not feasible 
under these conditions. And, inasmuch as I cannot prepare responses to the various 
government filings while I am visiting with Mr. Avenatti, the additional time that it takes to 
visit with him has made it inordinately difficult to deal with the multiple issues in the case. 
In the meantime, the government has made four additional productions of discovery 
since Mr. Avenatti was remanded last week. The new discovery apparently includes 
recordings of Mr. Avenatti's testimony at bar proceedings. Mr. Avenatti has not reviewed any 
of the new discovery, much less the new recordings, and we have no idea how, when, or under 
what conditions he will be able to review the new materials. Moreover, we have exchanged 
with the government drafts of transcripts of the recordings that are at the center of this case —
the telephone call and meeting between Mr. Avenatti and the Nike lawyers. We have not yet 
To be clear, all of the officers at MCC-New York with whom we, and Mr. Avenatti, have 
interacted have been professional, respectful and courteous. The circumstances we describe herein 
are not at all a criticism of the corrections officers, but rather a reflection of the reality of his 
placement in the SHU. 
The one accommodation is that today I was permitted to leave a small amount (some three inches 
worth) of the recent discovery with the officers in SHU for them to determine later whether to 
allow Mr. Avenatti to have the documents in his cell. As I write this letter, I do not know whether 
he was allowed to review the documents. 
EFTA00029585

Case 1:19-cr-00373-PGG Document 176 Filed 01/20/20 Page 3 of 3 
been able to meaningfully review the government's version of the transcripts with Mr. Avenatti 
and we do not know when he will be able to review those transcripts while simultaneously 
listening to the recordings. Perhaps we will know more tomorrow, when the legal staff returns. 
Although, as mentioned earlier, we have been in communication with government 
counsel to help address these difficult conditions (and counsel has been as helpful as they can 
be), we bring this matter to the Court's attention today to seek the Court's assistance given the 
Court's desire — and ours — to commence the trial of this matter as soon as possible. Our 
principal ask is that Mr. Avenatti be moved to general population, where he has the same 
ability to confer with counsel as other pretrial detainees. While we understand that there may 
be hypersensitivity about Mr. Avenatti given the profile of the case, and recent issues at the 
institution, this situation is truly hampering our ability to prepare for trial. We ask that 
accommodations be made consistent with his right to a fair trial and to be "afforded reasonable 
opportunity for private consultation with counsel." 18 U.S.C. §3142(iX3). Specifically, we 
ask at a minimum that Mr. Avenatti: 1) be allowed to keep legal materials in his cell; 2) have 
access to a computer, like other pretrial detainees, to review discovery similar to other pretrial 
detainees; 3) have contact legal visits in the regular attorney visiting room, where we can 
review documents and freely communicate with him; and 4) have the same social call 
privileges as detainees in general population so that he can communicate with his family to 
help make arrangements with third parties to fund his defense. 
Respectfully, 
1s/ Scott A. Srebnick

Re: 
Response to Government Letter dated August 18, 2021, Dkt. 320, United States v. 
Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) 
Dear Judge Nathan, 
I write in response to the government's letter dated August 18, 2021, Dkt. 320, which 
raises two issues.' 
Identities of Co-Conspirators 
The government first attempts to walk back its multiple concessions regarding disclosure 
of the identities of the unnamed co-conspirators alleged in the S2 indictment. 
As this Court noted, Ms. Maxwell has on at least two occasions requested such 
disclosure. Dkt. 317 at 12 n.1 (citing Dkt. 291 and Dkt. 293). Only after this Court ordered 
disclosure of the identities of the unnamed co-conspirators alleged in the S2 indictment did the 
government finally object. The government's objection comes too late. 
' As directed by the Court, on August 24 the parties conferred about the government's 
letter, but they were unable to reach an agreement on the government's requests for 
reconsideration. 
EFTA00029590
--- PAGE 2 ---

The Honorable Alison J. Nathan 
August 30, 2021 
Page 2 
The government's objection is, in substance, a motion to reconsider. "There is `no 
specific rule, either in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure or in this district's local criminal 
rules that provide for reconsideration of a ruling in a criminal matter.' United States v. 
Okparaeke, No. 17-CR-225 (NSR), 2019 WL 4233427, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 6, 2019) (quoting 
United States v. Cartagena, No. 10 Cr. 222-2, 2012 WL 2958175, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. July 20, 
2012)). Even so, courts have discretion to reconsider prior rulings in criminal cases when the 
moving party can point to "controlling law or factual matters which it believes the court 
overlooked and that might reasonably be expected to alter the court's decision." United States v. 
Berger, 188 F. Supp. 2d 307, 328-39 (S.D.N.Y. 2002). 
But "[t]he standard for granting a motion for reconsideration `is strict.' Fanner v. 
United States, No. 12-CR-758/15-cv-6287 (MN), 2017 WL 3448014, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 10, 
2017) (quoting Analytical Surveys, Inc. v. Tonga Partners, L.P., 684 F.3d 36, 52 (2d Cir. 2012)). 
That's because "[r]econsideration of a court's previous order is an `extraordinary remedy to be 
employed in the interests of finality and conservation of scarce judicial resources.' Montanile v. 
Nat '1 Broad. Co., 216 F. Supp. 2d 341, 342 (S.D.N.Y. 2002). 
The government cannot show extraordinary circumstances here. The government twice 
had notice of Ms. Maxwell's request for disclosure, and the government twice chose not to 
object. The government cannot use a motion to reconsider to save itself from the consequences 
of its deliberate decisions. "[A] losing party" is not permitted to "examin[e] a decision and then 
plug[] in the gaps of a lost motion with additional matters." Berger, 188 F. Supp. 2d at 339. 
Because that is exactly what the government is attempting to do, this Court should deny the 
government's request. Ms. Maxwell is entitled to the disclosure this Court ordered.

Co-Conspirator Statements 
The government's letter raises a second issue-disclosure of the purported co-conspirator 
statements it intends to offer at trial. The government says that, at least as of August 18, it 
intends to seek admission of co-conspirator statements from only two individuals: Jeffrey 
Epstein and the employee of Epstein's referenced in paragraph 25(d) of the S2 Indictment. Dkt. 
320 at 2. But the government also hedges, allowing for the possibility that it might identify 
"statements for use at trial from additional co-conspirators." Id. 
Both in its August 18 letter and during an August 24 conferral call, the government took 
the position that it has no obligation to identify the specific statements it intends to offer under 
Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(E). The government told defense counsel that Ms. Maxwell 
could glean what statements might be offered from the government's witness list and exhibit list, 
once those lists are disclosed on October 11. 
This Court has already resolved this matter, and the government's position is another 
improper attempt to obtain reconsideration. 
After conferral, the parties spelled out their positions with respect to the disclosure of co-
conspirator statements and the identities of co-conspirators. Dkt. 291 at 5, 8-9. On June 2, this 
Court ordered the government to disclose "co-conspirator statements" no later than October II. 
Dkt. 297 at 1. In the same order, the Court additionally ordered the government to disclose its 
witness list and proposed exhibit list, also by October 11. Id. The Court then ordered the parties 
to file their motions in limine by October 18 and responses by November 1.2
The in limine response date since has been advanced to October 25, 2021. Dkt. 330.

August 30, 2021 
Page 4 
If disclosure of the witness and exhibit lists were by themselves sufficient to give Ms. 
Maxwell notice of the specific co-conspirator statements the government intends to admit at trial, 
this Court would not have separately ordered the government to disclose "co-conspirator 
statements." Id. But that's not what the Court did. 
There are very good reasons for this. This Court serves as a gatekeeper to the admission 
of alleged co-conspirator statements. The Supreme Court's decision in Bourjaily v. United States 
requires the Court to determine, by a preponderance of the evidence, whether statements of a co-
conspirator are admissible under Rule 801(d)(2)(E). 483 U.S. 171, 175-76 (1987). In making this 
determination, the Court must find that a conspiracy existed, that its members included the 
declarant and the party against whom the statement is offered, and that the statement was made 
during the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy. Bourjaily, 483 U.S. at 175. 
If the government does not disclose what co-conspirator statements it intends to offer, as 
this Court already ordered the government to do by October 11, then Ms. Maxwell will be unable 
to file a motion in limine by October 18 challenging the admissibility of the co-conspirator 
statements and thereby put the government to its burden of proof and ensure this Court is able to 
discharge its gatekeeping function. See Bourjaily, 483 U.S. at 175-76. Although the government 
may not wish to give Ms. Maxwell the required notice, this Court has already entered its order. 
The government's letter offers no reason, much less a compelling reason, for this Court to 
reconsider its order. The government has not even attempted to identify "controlling law or 
factual matters which it believes the court overlooked and that might reasonably be expected to 
alter the court's decision." Berger, 188 F. Supp. 2d at 328-39. And that's because the Court 
didn't overlook anything. The parties briefed this issue in their joint letter regarding pretrial

scheduling deadlines, this Court considered the parties' positions, and it made a decision. Dkt. 
297 at 1. The government has offered nothing to justify reconsideration. 
Conclusion 
Ms. Maxwell asks this Court to confirm what it already ordered: (1) that the government 
disclose the identities of the unnamed co-conspirators charged in the S2 indictment at the same 
time it discloses Jenks Act material; and (2) that, no later than October I I, the government 
disclose the specific co-conspirator statements it intends to admit at trial.

I ran travel for both Maxwell and Epstein between 1/1/1997 to 2/1/2000. 
After reviewing the travel details, the dates that correlate or are near the dates listed for 
are listed below. These 
are listed as INBOUND records. 
Jeffrey Epstein: 
• 12/11/1999 
• 1/21/2000 
Ghislaine Maxwell 
• 6/23/1997 
• 8/6/1997 
• 7/20/1998 
• 7/24/1998 
• 12/18/1999 
• 1/21/2000 
I included 6/23/1997 and 8/6/1997 because between those dates GM traveled OUTBOUND. The same for 7/20/1998-
7/24/1998. 
I attached each individual records as well as the full travel records for 1/1/1997-2/1/2000.

Subject: Conflict Check (2021 Annual Sweep) 
Importance: High 
Good afternoon, 
asked me to help manage the Office's annual check for cases that might raise a conflict for a 
supervisor. For example, you may be working on a case that involves ABC Corp.; and even though the case 
would not create a conflict for you, if anybody in your line of supervision owns more than de minimis ABC 
Corp. stock, that supervisor will have a conflict and we need to keep the case away from him or her. 
Attached is a list of your cases and a list of the entities—corporations and law firms—that may create a conflict 
for one of your supervisors. There is one list for the Crim Div and one list for the Civ Div. 
If any of your cases involves one of those entities (other than routine subpoenas to banks and service providers), 
please (using Adobe's Add Text functionality) type in the Asset ID code(s) for the pertinent entity(ies). Save and 
return the form to me. 
Negative responses are required.

Dear 
We spoke earlier this week in relation to the Jeffrey Epstein case and you asked me to email if I had a specific enquiry. 
I understand that a woman has recently made a report to the Metropolitan Police in London regarding a sexually 
assaulted by Jeffrey Epstein. 
Could you please tell me whether the Metropolitan Police has informed the office of the US Attorney of the Southern 
District of New York and/or the FBI of this criminal complaint? When did the alleged assault take place and where? Is the 
FBI investigating this new complaint? 
Yours sincerely,

If helpful, the attached email from our counterparts at Main and BOP lays out the BOP's understanding of and media 
strategy for today's production of Epstein materials to the Times. As discussed previously, we've agreed to have them to 
refer inquiries to us. They've also asked for guidance on timing. Thanks! 
Subject: RE: Epstein FOIA 
All, 
FYI, 
lust called from Main (I believe she's still at Fed Programs). She said there was interest from the AG's 
Office in the release and had some questions. We talked through things, and she said she'd carry the info back. She said 
she or someone else from DC might follow up. 
Thanks,

Subject: Epstein FOIA 
Morning. Just for your awareness, I got a call regarding the FOIA litigation from one of our press counterparts at Main. 
She asked if it would be okay to refer press inquiries to SDNY, I told her it wasn't a problem. Other than process 
questions, 
and I anticipate declining to comment anyway.

Do we have a sense of timing as to when this will happen? (I was having a hard time hearing during the call, but my 
impression was tomorrow and it would be voluminous and take the Times a while to get through?) Thanks.

I am a very close friend of Ms. 
and her guardian, Ms. 
of Calderitas, Mexico. Ms. 
was abused by 
Jeffrey Epstein on numerous occasions at his townhome in New 
York and his caribbean island home in the Virgin Islands. They 
both have expressed their interest in asking me to register her claim 
as a victim in any case involving Mr. Epstein's estate, which she 
believes she may have a claim. 
She does not have legal representation yet, but is in negotiations to 
retain and attorney soon.

Glad you are reaching out. There has been quite a bit of news in the UK about FBI/DOJ interest in Prince 
Andrew. Right now I have open afternoons today and tomorrow, but have events both nights. So if there is a 
time that works between 1:30 and 5 pm GMT (8:30-noon EDT), let me know. I have some time late in my day 
on Thursday. Friday is pretty much flat out. 
Thanks,

My colleagues 
and I are the team of prosecutors working on the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, and 
we wondered if we might be able to set up a call with you for sometime this week, to ask you some logistical questions 
we're hoping you might either be able to answer or to point us in the right direction on. Would that be possible? If 
there are a few times in the coming days that you're free, we can try to figure out a slot that works for everyone. 
Thanks very much, and looking forward to being in touch.

We've received a hard drive from FBI CART, which they've processed from devices seized and searched in connection with 
the Epstein case. Can we please get those materials uploaded to Relativity, for privilege review by 
(copied here)? I've 
left the hard drive with the materials on your chair. (And if we could please get that hard drive back once the materials 
are uploaded, the FBI has another batch they want to transmit to us for the same process, so that will also be coming 
shortly.) 
And then M, these will be subject to just the exact same privilege review you previously ran in connection with Epstein 
search warrant returns. 
Please let us know if any questions or issues at all? And thanks very much as always.

Similar to prior requests in connection with the Epstein investigation (2018R01618), but with an added international 
element, we'd like to please request permission for the team to travel next week for an interview near Stockholm, 
Sweden, next week on January 29th and/or 30th. We expect to be traveling, respectively, some combination of the 27th 
(overnight) to the 31st, depending on when the interview ends up being scheduled, and we'll put final dates on our 
formal applications. Also similar to prior trips, we'd like to request approval to get a conference room for one of those 
days at a hotel for the interview itself. 
Also based on our discussion earlier we'll be mindful of looking for domestic (or domestic-flagged) carrier flights, as well 
as the costs of any alternatives, in looking at possible specific bookings. Thanks as always for your help and input on 
that.

Team, just as an FYI, no obligation at all for anybody else to do this, but I switched my L.A. hotel to a different spot for our 
upcoming visit — at least through our booking systems, the DoubleTree in Santa Monica during that time is over our 
allowable daily price for whatever reason — but even more importantly, last time we were there the front desk told me 
that construction there was going to be a complete nightmare from January through at least March (i.e., all the drilling 
from last time, but much worse). And I didn't see any other normal / decent business hotels in that area that were within 
our per diem (with the possible exception of the Le Meridien). 
However, for the first time in any of the trips we've ever been out there, the Beverly Hilton is listed within our per diem 
($181 for the AUSAs), and it's less than a ten minute drive from both 
attorney's office and 
attorney's 
office (and we could of course get a conference room there for 
). It's not the fanciest hotel in the world, but it's a 
normal Hilton, the location is perfect, and no drilling (!), so I went for it and wanted to recommend it and let everybody 
know. No worries if people prefer elsewhere, but it's an option.

I think they are in the Subpoena Returns folder, which I thought was strange. I'm heading to 
now but will log in 
after that to find them.

M, just tried calling but didn't catch you — I don't see where these are located in Relativity? I think they should be under 
"Search Warrant Returns" but I don't see them there (or anywhere else under the Epstein overall folder). Let me know if 
I've just missed them, which is entirely possible, or if they're not accessible to us yet? Thank you!

We've received a hard drive from FBI CART, which they've processed from devices seized and searched in connection 
with the Epstein case. Can we please get those materials uploaded to Relativity, for privilege review by 
(copied 
here)? I've left the hard drive with the materials on your chair. (And if we could please get that hard drive back once 
the materials are uploaded, the FBI has another batch they want to transmit to us for the same process, so that will also 
be coming shortly.) 
And then M, these will be subject to just the exact same privilege review you previously ran in connection with Epstein 
search warrant returns. 
Please let us know if any questions or issues at all? And thanks very much as always.

Following up on our phone call, thank you for talking with us again, and we wanted to get back to you regarding some 
of the additional follow-up questions you asked, and to describe in more detail for your client how we would expect to 
approach any discussion with your client if she were comfortable meeting with us. 
The absolute most important thing is that any discussion would be entirely voluntary, and by that we mean the 
decision to meet with us but also as to any topic or question—your client would be absolutely free to determine what 
topics she felt comfortable discussing. There is absolutely no pressure on victim witnesses to address anything that 
would make them uncomfortable at any time, and even if your client was willing to meet with us, we would tell her, as 
we do for any witness, that if any topic comes up that she wants to skip, or discuss with you privately, that is no 
problem at all. 
In fact, if you and she would prefer, we would be happy to have a meeting where we simply introduced ourselves, 
explained the status of our investigation, talked about how a discussion would proceed if your client ended up being 
comfortable with that, and answered in person any questions she. We have done that previously, where we do the 
talking rather than asking questions in an initial meeting, and that would of course be without any requirement for 
anything additional if she preferred not to. As I mentioned on the phone, we have consistently found that we are able 
to reassure individuals when we have the opportunity to meet in person so they can see directly our interest in 
approaching these discussions with great sensitivity and care. As I also mentioned on the phone, even if your client 
were willing to speak with us, there would be absolutely no need or requirement for her to talk about any assault or 
victimization she experienced. We wrote in our first email that we would primarily be interested in talking about 
topics such as the general scope of her employment, directions she received from Epstein or Maxwell, etc., and as 
always we would be guided by her comfort level. 
In terms of who would attend a meeting, we almost always work in pairs, so two prosecutors and two officers, and 
that's not to have extra people, but rather because it helps us to be as efficient as we can, and so witnesses can meet 
the people on the team. Our team is also majority female, and we always tell witnesses that if topics come up in a 
discussion that they would prefer to speak about just with women, that's fine and we can be flexible in the moment 
and are always guided by the comfort level of the victim. But I also want to stress that in terms of your client in 
particular, we don't expect to initially address issues of a very personal or sexual nature, and we certainly would tell 
you in advance if there came a time when we thought that might be important to address, and how we could facilitate 
that. Who exactly from our team would be at any meeting would depend on schedules, but we can assure you that 
every one of us has now spoken with dozens of victims in this case, and every one of us has extensive experience more 
generally working with victims and working on cases involving sex offenses. We are proud of how we have been able 
to work with victims in this case especially, given all of the circumstances, and we absolutely would take the same 
sensitive approach with your client as we have with the many other victims in this case who have spoken with us. 
Again, if it would be helpful even for us to just come to the U.K. and introduce ourselves and explain in person how our 
process works, and answer any questions your client has in person, we would absolutely be happy to do that with no 
obligation at all from her. We also could do that with the possibility that if she felt comfortable, we could just address 
the general subject of her employment, for example. But no obligation and no pressure. We continue to appreciate 
your and her willingness to even broach the possibility of a discussion, and we hope this is helpful.

Jill, 
Thanks for circling back, and we'll do our best to answer these questions. In terms of who would be in the room, the 
most likely answer is that it would be two of the prosecutors and the two law enforcement officers on the case. The 
only reason I saw "most likely" rather than having a definitive answer is that when we're interviewing in a foreign 
country, it sometimes is the case the local law enforcement also insists on having representatives present. I don't 
believe that's required in the U.K., but we can check on it and give you a definitive answer in the coming days if that's 
useful. (Also, if she preferred to be interviewed in the U.S., we certainly could guarantee that the room would be just 
the case team, and we could arrange for travel and lodging for her. Let us know if that's the case, but otherwise we're 
of course happy to travel to her.) 
Regarding access to notes, it would principally be the investigative team—so again, the prosecutors and the FBI team 
working on the case. Our respective supervisors also theoretically have access to our files, but the reports are not 
generally widely disseminated. The basic logistics are that an agent takes notes during an interview, and then types up 
those notes into a formal report (called an FBI Form 302). We don't ordinarily share notes with other entities, but I 
can also check on that to see if I can make a more specific representation with respect to your client. 
With respect to anonymity, I confess that I'm not familiar with the distinction you're referring to. In terms of our 
investigation, we don't publicly disclose the names of individuals we meet with, and we don't disclose to any other 
witnesses, for example, the identities of victims or witnesses we are meeting with. (And our policies on that don't 
change even for individuals who are in the position of your client, who have been widely publicly reported to have 
been connected to Epstein and/or his employees or associates). But if that doesn't answer your question, we're of 
course happy to discuss further. Let me know if it might be useful to have a call? Or if not, also happy to address any 
follow-up via email.

Thanks for this. I've been asked who would be in the room and thereafter who would have access to any

As you know there is a real difficulty in relation to her anonymity in the US versus the UK. Are you able to 
provide any comfort on this?

As requested, we wanted to briefly memorialize our current views and understandings of your client, and also to 
reiterate our interest in approaching any discussion with great care and sensitivity, particularly to avoid adding to her 
trauma or causing re-victimization. 
As we mentioned on the phone, your client is not a target of our investigation—it sounds like the analogue in the 
U.K. may be the "suspect" category—and we currently do not have reason to believe that she has committed any 
U.S. federal crime. As we discussed, our knowledge of your client specifically is somewhat limited, having never 
spoken to her—and therefore knowing about her only through other witnesses and records—but it certainly has 
been our experience that the overwhelming majority of young women and girls who were in the orbit of Jeffrey 
Epstein during the relevant periods were subject to his abuse. It does not surprise us, nor do we have any trouble 
believing, that your client was similarly a victim. I hope that is helpful in understanding the capacity in which we 
hope to speak with her. 
Separately, and as we also discussed, any discussion with our team would be entirely voluntary—and that extends 
not just to whether she would be willing to meet with us at all, but also including her ability to decline to discuss 
particular topics or even particular questions, and to talk with her counsel at any time, to take any breaks that would 
be beneficial while we're meeting, etc. 
In terms of topic areas, we would be hoping to learn about the general narrative of her interactions with Epstein and 
his other associates and employees, including Ghislaine Maxwell, whom we understand she may have worked 
directly for. That would broadly include how she came to be in contact with them, the nature and scope of her 
employment, any instructions she was given relating to other women or girls, and just generally her experiences and 
observations in interacting with them. We ordinarily would also be interested in understanding the general nature of 
the abuse she was subjected to, but I want to emphasize that we would not need to discuss with her the specifics if 
she weren't comfortable with that, and in particular we often don't even broach that subject in a first meeting. 
Please let us know if you have any additional questions, and in particular whether any other information from us 
would be useful, and we look forward to speaking with you again soon.

No problem at all, we understand this takes time, and we appreciate you getting back to us, and we're very grateful that 
your client is open to speaking with us. 
On your questions, we are certainly fine with the first two questions / requests — we're happy to meet with you and your 
client in an initial conversation, during which we can do the kind of introductions and explanations we've done with you 
(and that we do with all victim witnesses we meet), including answering any questions to the best of our ability, and 
then to take a break and have a more substantive discussion later on. 
Regarding the friend, does that individual also represent her as counsel? We aren't normally able to include individuals 
in addition to the witness and counsel in an interview—what does sometimes work is for someone who is providing 
support (a parent, friend, etc.) to be close by for any discussions, assistance, etc. anytime that a witness wants to speak 
with that person, which would of course be totally fine in this instance. Or if he represents her in his capacity as an 
attorney then he of course could be in the interview in that role (with the only caveat that we would just want to 
confirm that he himself is not separately a witness of some sort in the case). We unfortunately are not able to pay for 
third parties (including counsel) to travel in connection with witness interviews, though — if it's preferable, we certainly 
could pay for your client's travel to the U.S. for the interview, including airfare and lodging, if that makes it easier for the 
friend to be present? And we're happy to discuss any of this further by email or phone if that's useful — I'll be at my 
desk for the next several hours and most of tomorrow, at 
or we could also set a time to chat, whatever 
would be helpful.

Hello
Apologies for the slight delay. My client is willing to help but asks the following: 
• 
That there be a morning meeting at which introductions with a discussion as to the investigation and my clients 
involvement. I appreciate that you have explained this to me but I think further verbal clarification would assist. 
<

• 
In the afternoon and after a break, my client would be willing to answer questions, in so far as she can. 
• 
That a friend of hers be allowed to be present as well. However that friend is based in the US and would need to 
be flown over to London. He is a US lawyer. 
Perhaps you could let me know if this is possible?

Epstein during the relevant periods were subject to his abuse. It does not surprise us, nor do we have any trouble 
believing, that your client was similarly a victim. I hope that is helpful in understanding the capacity in which we 
hope to speak with her. 
Separately, and as we also discussed, any discussion with our team would be entirely voluntary—and that extends 
not just to whether she would be willing to meet with us at all, but also including her ability to decline to discuss 
particular topics or even particular questions, and to talk with her counsel at any time, to take any breaks that would 
be beneficial while we're meeting, etc. 
In terms of topic areas, we would be hoping to learn about the general narrative of her interactions with Epstein and 
his other associates and employees, including Ghislaine Maxwell, whom we understand she may have worked 
directly for. That would broadly include how she came to be in contact with them, the nature and scope of her 
employment, any instructions she was given relating to other women or girls, and just generally her experiences and 
observations in interacting with them. We ordinarily would also be interested in understanding the general nature of 
the abuse she was subjected to, but I want to emphasize that we would not need to discuss with her the specifics if 
she weren't comfortable with that, and in particular we often don't even broach that subject in a first meeting. 
Please let us know if you have any additional questions, and in particular whether any other information from us 
would be useful, and we look forward to speaking with you again soon.

One of Maxwell's attorneys sent the below email. I've attached the Friday ruling that he is referring to which is not a bail 
order and instead relates to the conditions of confinement. As you know, he already appealed Judge Nathan's prior bail 
orders. (After he filed the bail appeal in the Circuit, Judge Nathan subsequently denied the defense's request for a 
renewed bail hearing). Does he need to file a new appeal? It's not clear to us what he is doing here. Happy to give you a 
call to discuss. 
Thanks!

Hi M. 
I hope this note finds you well. 
Based on the court's ruling on Friday, I will be Sling a renewed motion for bond in the Second Circuit. I 
will note the government's opposition unless you inform me that I am mistaken. 
Thanks,

Hi 
We understand you had been planning to make the Noel/Thomas FOIA disclosure on Friday. We just ran this by =, 
and she'd like you to ask for a brief (1-2 week) extension to enable us to confer internally regarding the interviews, which 
were just completed, to confirm we agree they've fulfilled that requirement of their deferred prosecution agreements. 
She's going to speak with

I caught one of the officers who normally does SHU rec. He confirmed that

SHU rec is normally from about 6:00/6:30 to 10:30/11:00. The officer said

eventually wakes up, he never asks them to go. The officer said when

The Facilities Manager told me they talked to 
He had no complaints about his cell. He only complained that 
water leaked in his cell when people "took ion showers." Facilities ran the shower for awhile and didn't see the water 
leaking down to

its way down there eventually after it's been running for a long, long time. 
Evening watch SHU staff confirmed they gave

Initially, we propose that the lawyers (myself, my colleagues at Akin Gump, and someone from DB Legal) deliver a 
presentation that provides an overview of Epstein's relationship with the bank, the different accounts affiliated with 
Epstein and the types of transactions found in the accounts. We would also highlight various transactions that we have 
noted in our internal investigation. Our aim is that the attorney proffer would help you in sifting through the records we 
have provided so you can more readily identify whatever information you are most interested in. Following the proffer, if 
there are particular accounts or transactions of interest, we can identify the person withir■who can best answer 
questions on those areas and that person would then meet with you. 
In terms of timing, I estimate 2-3 hours for the attorney proffer. (I think closer to 2 hours but I hate to underestimate.)

Parvin, 
Could you please let us know what format we should expect in terms of the proffer? That will help us with figuring out 
scheduling. I.e., do you expect to make an attorney proffer in the first instance, or should be expect to be meeting with 
'ersonnel, etc? And approximately how long should we be planning to block out?

Hi 
The proffer may be helpful in guiding you through the production. That said, we can be available whenever makes most 
sense on your ends. 
We have time this week (Thursday or Friday afternoon) and next week (Monday — Wednesday), and we have time in 
September. If you give us a few options in terms of dates/times, we will sort out schedules on our ends.

Parvin, 
We received the index, thank you. In terms of a proffer, what generally did you have in mind regarding timing? I think 
we'd like to have some time with the subpoena returns to get familiarized, and our team has a combination of travel and 
trials in the next couple weeks, but we could do early September if that works on your end. Thoughts?

produce additional documents. 
Would you like to touch base later today about scheduling a proffer? We are free after 4 p.m.

Following up on our conversation last week, are you able to share with us your thoughts on whether the defense 
intends to address the Court beyond noting that there is no objection to the dismissal? 
Separately, if you could please let us know the status of the return of discovery materials, we would appreciate it. 
We are hopping to be able to tell the Court on Tuesday that this issue is resolved.

approximately around 12:45 — 1:00. 
Separately, based on the expected nolle order, and in connection with the protective order in this case, in advance of the 
hearing on Tuesday can you please either return to the Government all discovery you received in this case and certify 
that any copies have been security destroyed or deleted, or, alternatively, simply certify that all discovery received has 
been security destroyed or deleted? (As to the second option, that is to say that you do not need to make additional 
copies of electronic materials to formally "return" them to us if it is more efficient to simply delete and destroy the 
existing electronic copies you have.) We want to be able to advise the Court on Tuesday that there are no outstanding 
discovery obligations on either side based in connection with the protective order.

be struggling with the idea that their accusations could remain unvindicated as a result of these events. Is there any

Hello Everyone, 
Our HQ staff was contacted by the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) in association with the matters concerning the 
Epstein/MCC case, and informed that they would like to convene a Board of Inquiry that would review the operations at 
the MCC NY. I have been asked to share this with the investigative and prosecution team for opinion and 
consideration. I requested that the BOP provide us with some specific information and details about what this would 
include and we were provided with the below information and attached Program Statement. Can you all please review

The BOP would like to convene a Board of Inquiry (relevant Program Statement attached) that would review operations 
generally at MCC New York. Among other issues, it will look at local policy and procedures related to special housing, 
review camera operations, and review training and staffing issues. This will not, of course, be a misconduct investigation. 
Should the Board come across anything that appears to be new misconduct allegations, they will be reported consistent 
with normal misconduct reporting requirements. 
We are mindful of the on-going criminal investigation, and are aware that administrative charges may also arise 
connected to the criminal case. We will studiously avoid creating any sort of conflict with that case. Please let me know if 
you  additional questions or would like to discuss. Thanks in advance.

Lawsuit Claims Epstein Trafficked Girls in 
Caribbean Until 2018 
The attorney general of the Virgin Islands says Mr. Epstein and his associates used a database to track 
victims as young as 11 years old.

By Ali Watkins 
Jan. 15, 2020Updated 2:41 p.m. ET 
New evidence shows Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused and trafficked hundreds of young women and 
girls on his private Caribbean island, some as recently as 2018, significantly expanding the scope of his 
alleged conduct, a top law enforcement official said in a lawsuit filed on Wednesday. 
Mr. Epstein, a wealthy financier who died by suicide in a Manhattan jail last year, was bringing girls as 
young as 11 and 12 to his secluded estate in the Virgin Islands, known as Little Saint James, and kept a 
computerized database to track the availability and movements of women and girls, the lawsuit said. 
The lawsuit, which was filed by Denise N. George, the attorney general of the Virgin Islands, 
broadened the dimensions of the wrongdoing in which Mr. Epstein was said to have engaged. He had 
been charged by Manhattan prosecutors in July with sexually exploiting dozens of women and girls in 
New York and Florida, but they did not point to any actions beyond 2005. 
In August, Mr. Epstein hanged himself at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, where he was being 
held awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking and conspiracy charges. Prison guards had not checked on 
him for hours on the night he died, and the circumstances surrounding his death are now the subject 
of at least three federal investigations.
In the weeks before Mr. Epstein killed himself, he and his lawyers vigorously denied the criminal 
charges. His lawyers had previously said he had been law-abiding since his 2008 conviction in Florida 
for solicitation. 
The suit was filed against Mr. Epstein's estate and seeks the forfeiture of Little Saint James and Mr. 
Epstein's second private island, Great Saint James, as well as the dissolution of numerous shell 
EFTA00029747
--- PAGE 3 ---
companies he established in the territory that officials have said acted as fronts for his sex trafficking 
enterprise. 
As part of its policies, the government of the Virgin Islands could take any assets recovered from Mr. 
Epstein's estate and consider disbursing them to women and girls who were victimized by him in the 
region, Ms. George said. 
The new accusations — which draw both from independent investigations by Ms. George's office and 
court documents from cases across the country — argue that Mr. Epstein ran a decades-long sex 
trafficking scheme that had a primary nexus in the Virgin Islands.

--- PAGE 5 ---
"Epstein clearly used the Virgin Islands and his residence in the U.S. Virgin Islands at Little Saint 
James as a way to be able to conceal and to be able to expand his activity here," Ms. George said. 
The suit underscores the legal complications of reckoning with such wide-reaching crimes as those Mr. 
Epstein is said to have committed. Ms. George's suit is the first filed against the estate by a government 
entity, but it joins a field of similar claims filed by more than a dozen women. 
It remains unclear how Mr. Epstein's assets, which are valued at about $500 million, could be 
allocated. 
"We don't have a long history of figuring out what to do in cases of human trafficking," said Bridgette 
Carr, the director of the Human Trafficking Clinic at the University of Michigan Law School, who 
consulted with Ms. George's team on the case. "I think this litigation and the courts are just trying to 
come up with the best, imperfect solution." 
Mr. Epstein's executor, Darren K. Indyke, could not immediately be reached for comment. 
Ms. George said she believed the case could chip away at the region's reputation as a notorious haven 
for the rich and powerful. 
"We will not remain complacent, and we will enforce our laws whatever way we can," Ms. George said. 
"It doesn't matter the social status of the person. It's that the laws apply equally."

The court documents said that Mr. Epstein operated with impunity for years at Little Saint James and 
Great Saint James, which he obtained through a straw purchaser in 2016. 
As recently as July 2018, Mr. Epstein refused to permit an investigator from the Virgin Island's 
Department of Justice to enter Little Saint James, claiming the island's dock was his "front door," 
according to the lawsuit. The investigator was doing routine monitoring of Mr. Epstein because he was 
a registered sex offender. 
Mr. Epstein's victims included aspiring models from South America, according to court documents. 
EFTA00029750
--- PAGE 6 ---
Mr. Epstein used a ring of associates to rotate the women and girls in and out of sexual servitude, 
using fraudulent modeling visas to transport them across state lines and international borders, the 
lawsuit said. He tracked their availability and proximity using the database, court documents said. 
The suit also said air traffic controllers in the Virgin Islands observed Mr. Epstein leaving his private 
plane in 2018 with girls who looked as young as 11. 
In one undated incident detailed in the lawsuit, a 15-year-old girl attempted to swim off Mr. Epstein's 
island and escape after she was forced to engage in sex acts with Mr. Epstein and others. The girl was 
found, and held captive on the island after he confiscated her passport, the suit said. 
Prosecutors in New York have said their investigation has continued and anyone who helped Mr. 
Epstein could face criminal charges.
In addition, the lawsuit said, Mr. Epstein embarked on several illegal construction projects at Great 
Saint James, which caused damage to native coral and wildlife. 
Continue reading  the main story 
The more than a dozen women who have filed lawsuits against Mr. Epstein's estate in New York City 
since his death have accused him of exploiting and sexually abusing them when they were young 
women and girls, according to court documents. Many are seeking financial compensation. 
The lawsuit in the Virgin Islands appears to be the first filed against the estate in that jurisdiction. Mr. 
Epstein maintained his legal permanent residence — and his estate — there. He hastily filed his will in 
a Virgin Islands court just days before he killed himself. 
Ms. George's lawsuit also seeks to head off an effort by Mr. Epstein's executor, Mr. Indyke, to turn Mr. 
Epstein's vast wealth into a victim's compensatory fund. Mr. Indyke's proposal, which is currently 
being litigated in a separate Virgin Islands case, imposes confidentiality on any claimants, Ms. George 
said. 
"The estate continues to engage in a course of conduct aimed at concealing the criminal activities of the 
Epstein enterprise," the lawsuit said. 
In a statement when that fund was first announced, Mr. Indyke said it would give victims "the 
opportunity to obtain appropriate compensation and to be heard and treated with compassion, dignity 
and respect."

Hi 
- I assume, given the news coverage, that your team and the executives have seen the lawsuit filed by the 
Virgin Islands government against Epstein's estate, the 1953 Trust, and various entities (which seeks, among 
other relief, to void the fraudulent transfer of assets to the trust)? If not, let me know and I can circulate the 
complaint and more detail to the broader group.

Yeah, we saw this on Friday and were a little frustrated not to have gotten the advance notice we had anticipated prior to 
them filing. We contacted counsel on Friday and he apologized and said they've been particularly busy. So, yeah. But he 
did send the complaint, which also has been filed on the docket, which presumably is where the Daily News found it (her 
attorney was surprised there was media about it, so I think they didn't cause the story). Complaint is fairly bare-bones, 
though it includes the Trump interaction she had with Epstein, and is attached here. No judge assigned yet.

Totally understand it's voluminous, but we do to need to move it because otherwise our searching process will be all 
messed up — we won't be able to run terms through all search warrant returns (instead, we'd have to duplicate literally 
every search across two different huge folders). And it doesn't work to just search all materials in the entire file because 
the FBI case file is also huge. 
If going forward there is any question at all on where things should go in the folder structure, we're more than happy to 
provide guidance on that.

M, just tried calling but didn't catch you — I don't see where these are located in Relativity? I think they should be

On 10/05/03, at 1000 hours, I responded to 358 El Brillo Way 
reference a burglary that had occurred at the residence during 
the night. Upon my arrival, I met with the homeowner who 
verbally identified himself as Jeffrey Epstein, DOB 01/20/53. 
Epstein told me that over the last couple of months, when he 
has come into town, he has money he had left in his carry on 
bag, has turned up missing. Epstein said he wasn't sure of the 
amount of money in the carry on bag on any specific incident 
and thought that he possibly had misplaced the money. Epstein

told me that he had purchased a spy camera from a store on 
Okeechobee Blvd. and had set up the camera which was in a 
t
clock in his office facing theBriefcase with the money in it. 
i 
Epstein then placed 84,000. in d.s. currency, one hundred dollar 
bill increments and left the bag on his desk as he always does 
when he is in town. Epstein said that he went to bed with the 
camera system monitoring the bag and desk area, only to wake up 
and twice to have $100. missing from the bag and the suspects 
image on his computer hard drive. It should be noted that there 
were thirteen one hundred dolla1 bills still in the white envelope 
and that nothing else in the ho se appeared to be disturbed by the 
suspect. 
I 
Epstein took me to the computerlroom where he showed me a computer 
monitor that was displaying a (Ain frame of the suspect. The 
computer indicated a time of 04th8 a.m., when the suspect came into 
the office area, walked behind ihe desk, opened the hand bag, and 
then opened the center drawer to the desk. It appeared as though 
the suspect was familiar with te house and the desk. Epstein 
told me that he did not know wh the suspect in the photo was 
but thought it might be his forger houseman because of his size 
and shape. Epstein also pointed lout that the suspect in the
an
video was wearing moccasin type shoes like his former houseman 
did 
did due to his back injury. Th suspect was a white male who 
was 5'10" in height, 250 lbs., searing tan pants, white shirt, 
and a hat. Epstein provided meiwith the former houseman's 
information which was 
advised Epstein that I would eed to obtain a copy of the 
surveillance video from his com uter hard drive in order to 
have in hands. Epstein told mei 
that he had limited working 
knowledge of the system but he ould contact the company who 
had installed the system and ha e them make a copy by Monday 
Epstein told me he would call when he had more information. 
Epstein took me to the desk whe re the carry on bag was and told 
me that he believed that the suspect might have gained entry 
into the house from the eliding glass doors on the south side 
of the house but not the west a de of house because he had 
personally locked all the sliders on that side of the house. 
It is believed that the suspectialeo left the house by the 
same sliding door that was unlo ked ae there were no pry marks 
or indication of forced entry into the house. Epstein also showed 
me the bookcase behind the desk where he kept his Glock 9 mm 
handgun between the books which was now missing. Epstein could 
not supply me with the serial 'limber for the handgun at this 
time but advised he would contact Gator Gun on Okeechobee 
Blvd. to obtain the information

AL 8:42 a.m., Sunday morning, 10/05/03, 1 was notified at home 
by the communication unit of the Palm Beach Police Dept. that a 
burglary had been reported at 358 El Brillo. I responded to the 
scene and proceeded directly to headquarters where I picked up 
the necessary equipment and the crime scene vehicle to process 
the crime scene.

10/08/03 
I went in service at 9:32 a.m. and arrived on the scene at 9:33 a.m. 
Upon arrival I noted that the house is located at the extreme west 
end of the street and is located on the south side of the street with 
the front of the house facing north. The house is basically a two 
story CBS type of structure having a white flat tile roof. The trim 
is painted white and there are walls approximately 8' tall with 
metal closing gates which are controlled with a electronic touch 
pad on the outside. There are white gargoyle figures on the tops 
of the entrance of the gate as well as black numerals 
approximately 6" high indicating the address numerics of 358. 
The east most drive way is a large flagstone type of drive way 
leading to a three car garage. 
The dwelling has in addition to the main entrance to the garage 
two other gated entrances which have black floral lighted tops on 
them. These gates were metallic. The central gate which leads

into a circular flagstone drive way was in the open position. The 
western most gate was in the closed position. The front was 
locked on my approach and L continued traveling to the west 
where there is a small double gate which has a sign, "Please keep 
gate closed". This gate was opened and leads to a large patio with 
a swimming pool. To the west of the swimming pool is a walk 
way leading to a dock which then leads directly across to the intra 
coastal waterway. The dock was examined and checked for any 
signs of a boat tying up or the presence of anyone that may have 
left either debris such food containers, cigarettes, cigars etc. None 
was found. It should be noted that the exterior temperature was 
degrees and the humidity was 63 percent. There is a small 
cabana at the southern end of the pool which had computer 
equipment as well as exercise equipment. None of this had been 
touched or tampered with. 
On the south side of the residence in the southwest corner Mr. 
Epstein indicated that he believed this was the area that the 
intruder made entry to the residence. The room is a computer 
room and Florida type room and has three double eliding glass 
windows present. The eastern most and western most are 
identical in shape having two glass panels. The central one has 
three glass panels and ie the only one of the three that has a set of 
flagstones leading directly into the room. The flooring ie a 
wood type of flooring and the western set of eliding doors was 
found ajar, however the eandy area directly outside of the door did 
not indicate the presence of shoe prints or barefoot prints. The 
central window was found ajar and still had the lock mechanism 
in the extended outward position. The two windows believed to 
have been entered were processed and no latent fingerprints were 
found on the western most, no fingerprints were found on the 
eastern most. There was one mark that was found that was not a 
fingerprint but could have been made from either a cloth or a 
rubber glove and this was found on the interior of the central 
window. 
Once inside the residence, the person went over to a desk which is 
a veneer covered desk and there was a black bag underneath. The 
black bag is approximately 2' long by 1' high and wan placed on 
the southern side of the interior of the desk by the pedestal. The 
individual knelt down and pulled the case open and removed cash 
from a white envelope. There were thirteen one hundred dollar 
bills left, still in the envelope when I examined it. The thirteen 
one hundred dollar bills were removed in the presence of net. 
Melnichok and Mr. Epstein and they were counted and turned 
directly over to Mr. Epstein for security purposes. The top of the 
desk, cides of the desk and bottom of the desk was processed for 
latent fingerprints and no latent fingerprints of value were found 
on those areas. The envelope will be transported to headquarters 
and processed chemically for latent fingerprints. There will be a 
supplement to that effect that will follow.

NARRATIVE 
# 8 
Reported By: 
Entered By.: 
On 10/08/03, officer 
advised me that he had located 
the vehicle parked in parking space #6, at the 
Condominium. Officer 
further advised that 
vehicle was a Ford Exp orer, dark in color, bearing Flor da tag 
on 10/13/03, I was advised by Sgt. 
that Epstein had met 
with 
and had reached an agreement to pay back the money 
taken and subject Epstein did not wish to prosecute a. this time. 
I was also advised that Det. 
had interviewed 
and 
had obtained a full confessio 
e theft of the money but had 
denied taking the Glock hand gun. 
in previous conversations, Epstein was not sure of the location 
of the hand gun but believed it had possibly been between the 
ii.
csbehind his desk. The su 
e video does not show 
taking the hand gun and 
enies taking the gun. 
On 10/15/03, at 1400 hours, I faxed the affidavit of prosecution 
to Epstein asking that he complete the document indicating that 
he does not wish to prosecute and fax it back to me along with 
mailing the original back to me for my case file. 
At 1500 hours, bet. 
removed the video surveillance 
equipment from Epetein's residence located at 358 El Brillo. 
Several attempts to obtain the affidavit of prosecution 
indicated that Epstein did not wish to prosecute were met 
with no response from his staff. It 
ed that 
Epstein had personally met with Capt. 
and at 
ime advised he no longer wished to prosecute 
for the burglary and theft from his residence. 
ATTN POLICE CLERKS.: Please show a full recovery of the U.B.

FYI, our NDO for the subpoenas we cut at the beginning of the case for Epstein's email accounts has expired, so they're 
going to notify (unclear to me who they'll notify, of course). I have no problem with that, but let me know if you think

left the hard drive with the materials on your chair. (And if we could please get that hard drive back once the materials

Wanted to circle back on this and check in, particularly because we desperately need to get the results from the July and 
September searches before moving forward with possible additional charges in the case. I know you had mentioned you 
needed to push back your prior estimate of complete production by early June, by a couple weeks, so wanted to see what 
the current estimate is? I don't think we've started to get anything yet but please correct me if I'm wrong.

Unfortunately, recent events and our staffing levels have conspired to put a kink in just about everything. If we 
can't make heads or tails of the stuff I've already produced, we'll do it again. They have told us that our staffing 
levels will be steadily increasing over the next few weeks, but I'm going to have to push back my estimate by a 
week or 2. Sorry about that. My next day in the office is Thursday, so I'll be able to see if I can easily identify 
what I already gave you and many it to a reliable identifier.

Thanks for this, it's a helpful start. In terms of being able to write our search warrant, one additional piece of information 
we need is the serial number, or some other specific identifier, ideally for each device but at least for any device that there 
is more than one of the same thing. So for example, we need to be able to somehow differentiate the following devices — 
The two Dell power edge T310 hard drives (NYCO24323 and NYCO24324) 
The two Sony Vaio laptop / Fujitsu hdd (NYCO24336 and NYCO24337) 
the following loose storage devices: 
o Micro SD card (NYCO24339) 
o Flash Drive (generic) (NYCO24340) 
o Thumbdrive (Emtec) (NYCO24341) 
o hard drive (loose) (NYCO24342) 
o verbatim thumbdrive (NYCO24343) 
The four San Disk cruzer-thumbdrives (NYCO24344-47) 
EFTA00029780
--- PAGE 4 ---
The three Seagate IDE hard drives (NYCO24348-50) 
The camera SD card (NYCO24351) 
I think the rest of the devices are either specifically distinguishable and/or have an S/N listed. (By comparison, the USVI 
spreadsheet we have lists an s/n for about 20 of the 25(ish) devices. 
The other thing we're looking for is the location in the house (and ideally specific location) for each device, which the USVI 
list also has — is that info available? 
The list also has just five devices as still pending to be transferred to us, and I think it's right that the plan is to reproduce 
all the materials so that we can get them in searchable format, but just wanted to confirm? Currently, we aren't able to 
match any of the prior productions to specific devices — so if we're able to match them up by Bates number now, that

Here is The listing of all the evidence gathered in NY that I have. I added some columns to guide you to the 
unique numbers CART NY uses fro their evidence. The template wasn't a slam dunk over, so I did what I could to 
convey the information. If you are confused by anything, please let me know. In the column for approximate 
size, it is in GB, totaled at the bottom and converted to TB. In the materials contained column, I put what load 
file group the data was transferred over in (Mac, Windows, Loose Media, IDE, or Blacklight) If there is no entry 
in that column, that data has yet to be transferred. There are 2 Macs and a DVR you don't have as well as an 
iPhone and an iPad. IF the descriptions are a bit light, let me know and I'll do what I can to beef them up. I will 
get you the Island stuff tomorrow.

Respectfully, I think there are some miscommunications here — all we have asked is to receive the materials in a format 
such that we can view them using a system we have access to. We're not able to get web-enabled access through any FBI 
tool, so we asked for the materials to be transferred in a loadable format so we could put them on Relativity, which both 
we and the agents can access. We're required to have the files in a format that we can produce them to defense counsel. 
I've done that in many other cases and it hasn't previously been an issue. My understanding from =I is that the best 
way to do it now is just for us (the U.S. Attorney's Office) to get the original files, which our vendor will process—by which 
I just mean converting into file formats that are loadable onto Relativity. It doesn't really have anything to do with the 
taint review—we have to have access to the docs in our systems for discovery purposes. 
And we were happy to get the materials as they were processed, but when we received the 1.1 million documents earlier 
this year, they were in a format that wasn't usable for the reasons described in the email I sent on March 9. Again, I 
understand from =I that the best way forward is to just get copies of the materials in their original formats, which I 
understand will be segregated and designated by device. That should work for us! I was just trying to understand the 
approach, as well as the timeline.

Just to be clear. The US Attorney's Office (or it's contractors) are not "processing" anything. You are taking files 
that I will be extracting from processed evidence and putting them into an E-Discovery tool (Relativity) to do a 
taint review. 
Relativity is NOT a forensic tool. It is incapable of dealing with many things that are found forensically on a 
computer like free space, slack space, and system files to name a few. When we started this, and you insisted 
you do the taint review in Relativity, I warned you that it was adding months worth of work on top of what was 
already done, and that Relativity was incapable of viewing everything. You insisted we do it this way. So now 
and I have come up with a way to fit this round peg into this square hole. We will get it done. 
Sorry it has taken so long, but we are talking about terabytes worth of data over multiple forms of digital 
evidence. Phones, tablets, loose media, cameras, DVRs, servers, laptops, and desktop computers. We have 
gotten past encryption on multiple devices. When we review devices on such large cases, we usually do it piece 
by piece as things are processed, I was unaware that you didn't want to review as things were processed, that 
you wanted to do it "all at once", so that added to the delay. Sorry for that. Just a differentiation of 
methodology I suppose. 
and I feel confident that the method we have come up with will be more consistent and preserve the 
attribution of files to devices and links of e-mails to attachments that the load file generation that I did a while 
back was lacking.

Okay, so just to check, you both think that there is not a need to do a test run? You're both comfortable with just basically 
sending us copies of everything? I don't totally understand why we couldn't have done that eight months ago, but 
regardless of the passage of time, I want to make sure we understand so we can report to our supervisors. I assume that 
means that we (at the U.S. Attorney's Office and through contractors) will therefore need to do all the processing 
ourselves, correct? And thanks again to you both.

it would be very helpful for us if you could please use the attached spreadsheet in transmitting that info so we 
make sure we get all the info we need. I think you had previously sent us a list of certain information that unfortunately 
wasn't helpful for us, so we want to make sure we're all on the same page. 
In terms of data transfer, 
are you just sending a literal copy of all the raw data, and we'll process and upload it on 
our end? I ask to make sure we don't lose any searchability — when FBI sent versions before, it had already been 
processed. I think what we talked about on the phone a month ago was getting, for example, data from one device to 
make sure it transfers correctly, before sending over literally everything — is that still the plan?

back in the office on Thursday and will be able to get you the list then as I have to access some of our systems to 
do so. 
Also, 
please reach out to me at one of the numbers below so we can brain storm. Thanks.

Following up on the below, I think you had said you expected to be able to get us a list of the devices seized from the 
search warrants at Epstein's residences in New York and the USVI, as well as from his person upon arrest, in about a 
month (during our conference call a month ago) — so wanted to check if we can still expect that very soon? We're waiting 
on that list to be able to do an updated search warrant on all of those devices. Please let us know the current timeline —
and also the current timeline on producing the results from those August and September searches? I think you and 
were going to coordinate on that, and you had mentioned you expected we'd have it a couple months from our call, which 
would be about a month from now. Wanted to make sure we're still on track.

Unfortunately I don't think this is very helpful to us. Did you take a look at the example spreadsheet I sent on 2/24? The 
excel file you sent has descriptions that don't match up to the items listed in the search warrant returns (that we sent on 
2/23), and we don't have the 1B or CART numbers to be able to cross-reference. We also can't tell what you mean by 
"loose media" without a specific comparison to what was seized, we don't know which items you're referring to as 
"Windows machines," and we can't tell whether the entirety of any particular item has been transferred, or just partial. 
For example, it looks like we have gotten very, very few image files, which is surprising. 
We have also encountered some very significant problems in trying to review the more than 1 million documents we 
recently received: 
The data we've received has no way to put any emails and attachments together. So if an email says, "see the 
attached flight records," for example, we have no way of linking that up with the records themselves. Not only is 
that a big problem for us in review, it's going to be a huge problem for producing the documents to defense 
counsel. 
The load file has no link to the native file, so when we load the data to the database, there's no way to have the 
native files show up in the database. Because many of the files are too large to open in the viewer, it effectively 
means that there are many files that are completely invisible to us. 
Related, the control numbers in the load file don't match up to the native files. So we have two sets of numbers 
and no way to match up anything—that is, even if we were to try to go hunt down every individual large file in the 
native files, it would be impossible. 
So the data that we most recently got, we need to get in a form that addresses those issues, and we likely will need to get 
a similar reproduction of the data we received a couple months ago. Otherwise we're sifting through more than a million 
documents without much rhyme or reason. 
I've re-attached the spreadsheet we sent last week — I think that's a good place to start in terms of our necessary record-
keeping, and we need that info at the very least, as well as anything else you think would be useful. Also attaching the SW 
returns for reference. And again, we're happy to meet up anytime and hash all this out in person if that's useful.

Here is a listing of what I have already handed over in load files to the US Attorney's Office for taint review. Some points of 
clarification: There were 9 IDE hard drives found in the Manhattan apartment, they turned out to be 3 copies of 3 drives 
(9 drives in total) from a July 2007 search on one of his properties. I only processed 3 (as they were all copies). All the 
loose media from the NY apartment is included. All the Windows machines from the NY apartment are included. Only 2 
Macs from NY and 1 from the Island are included. 
I will have to more closely coordinate with whoever is loading up Relativity with the remaining Macs as the tool 
they have to be processed with does not easily re-name the load files.

Totally understand about the network issues—we can relate. I do still think it will be helpful to all sit down together to 
have an in-person discussion, to make sure everybody is on the same page. Are folks available for that next week? And 
what I think would be most helpful to facilitate that would be a spreadsheet of each separate device referenced in the two 
search warrant returns, with columns for whether we've dumped the contents, whether they've been reviewed and/or 
transferred, what portions were transferred, etc. 
Something roughly like the attached, with any other categories you think would be useful — and the info on the attached is 
mostly hypothetical, obviously, just as examples. That will help us fully understand what's been reviewed, transferred, 
and received so far, and what remains. 
(Also just on the pictures, we do want copies of those as well, please including from the discs and the devices — I think FBI 
was going to do an initial screen to make sure no CP, and since I think the answer was no, we'll need to get those to be 
able to review them as well.)

Sony for the delayed response. They are tearing out our old network and giving us a new one, they mandated we 
delete old stuff (about 400 TB worth). Now that they are working on replacing the network, we can do only local 
work. I should be able to give you an accounting of what is what. I can say, off the top of my head, that all 
windows based items from the NY search have been handed over as well as all loose media. The CDs from NY

Following up on the below from last weekend, I'm still not sure how we're addressing this so I thought it would make 
sense for us to all schedule a (hopefully relatively brief) meeting to all get on the same page? We didn't hear back on 
which files had previously been provided, but our tech folks did their best to differentiate, and we got access to the 
materials yesterday and its well over a million documents, and we don't have any idea what we're looking at — i.e., which 
devices the materials came from, whether it's full or partial results, how many more devices we have coming, etc. 
Based on the attached search warrant returns, it looks like from the New York mansion (the PDF) there are approximately 
devices that would have storage (computers, hard drives, thumb drives, etc.) and that's not even counting at least 60+ 
CDs. And then from the Virgin Islands (the Excel spreadsheet), at least more than 25 devices, including multiple servers / 
server racks. 
So we gotta know what we've already received, what remains, anticipated schedule, etc, and I know it's a lot of moving 
pieces on all sides so wanted to loop in everybody at once. The case team will be in California this coming week from 
Tuesday through Friday, but then I think generally around the first week of March, which will hopefully be plenty of time 
to schedule a productive meeting.

I'm not sure who's the exact right person to ask this, so wanted to get everybody on one email chain about it — I have the 
hard drive that 
dropped off that has new Epstein search warrant materials, but it looks like there are also old 
materials (that I think we had previously received and uploaded??) on the hard drive, and so I'm not sure what's new. 
Just generally, and 
and I talked about this last week too, but it's basically impossible for us to keep track of what 
we're getting, and what has been completed, without some kind of identification or labeling system, along with a list of 
which devices have been extracted and downloaded. 
So for example on the hard drive currently, there are 38 folders labeled "loadFiles" through "37loadFiles" with a modified 
date of 11/14/19, which I think we may have already previously received — but I'm not sure, because we haven't gotten 
any info on which folders match up to which devices, etc. And then there's another folder titled "NYCO24362" that has a 
EFTA00029790
--- PAGE 14 ---
modified date of 1/27/20, so I think that may be the materials we hadn't previously received? That folder by itself has 
more than 600,000 items. 
I don't want to give 
anything that we've already previously received and uploaded, and I can't tell from the folder or 
file names whether everything on the drive is new, or whether just additional materials were saved onto it in addition to 
what we already have. =, 
are you able to give us some guidance on this? Ultimately what we really need is a 
spreadsheet of every device, whether it's been dumped (or partially dumped), and then identifying that same info —
which device, and what materials from it — are being given to us with each data transfer. Otherwise I think 
organizationally and for review purposes it will be a total disaster for us. 
We're happy to have a meeting on this if that's helpful — and thanks everybody for the assistance.

Thanks, 
I appreciate the concern and am open to working to address it, to the extent possible. We, of course, 
would never simply turn this material over to a civil litigant, as you suggest. The problem is, irrespective of our intent, this 
is not Rule 6 material (unless, of course, he testifies before a grand jury), and we are trying to be mindful of not simply our 
criminal case, but obligations we may have under other aspects of U.S. law, FOIA and/or Touhy, spring to mind, for 
example. Again, we never voluntarily turn this stuff over, and we frequently oppose FOIA requests and the like to the 
extent we can under the law. But particularly given the history and concern, we don't want to make promises we may not 
be able to keep. 
Do you by any chance have handy a copy of the MLAT itself (if not, certainly happy to locate myself, just figured you might 
have it already). I'd like to see what, if anything, the treaty says about this subject.

Thanks. This is helpful. One clarification which they will seek - because it seems to loom 
large in their suspicions - is whether his statement will be provided to victims for purposes 
of civil litigation. I know this is not something that ordinarily happens (I don't think I have 
ever done this) - but I think we need to say something about that to move this forward. 
Maybe something like, "Absent a court order directing otherwise, the SDNY will not use or 
disclose the statement in any matter other than a criminal investigation, prosecution, or 
related asset forfeiture action initiated by the United States government."

ININ Thanks for your patience. I've now had a chance to raise your suggestion on our end, and we are amenable to 
discussing a confidentiality agreement along the lines you propose, with some revisions. Below is our proposed language 
which we would be comfortable with. Happy to discuss our position further at your convenience. Thanks, Ted 
Prior to the in-person interview: 
From now until August 14, 2020, neither the witness nor any person representing him will 
make any statement to anyone (other than counsel) about the plans for or terms of the 
interview. Likewise, the SDNY agrees to make no public comment about the matter during this 
period. If an interview has not been concluded by August 14, this confidentiality agreement 
will not bar any further public or private comments on the matter. 
After an in-person interview: 
If the witness completes an interview with U.S. law enforcement, both parties may confirm 
publicly or privately that: "the witness has met with law enforcement authorities in the United 
States and answered questions about matters under investigation. We will not comment 
further." Further comment by the witness or any person representing or speaking for him will 
void this agreement. 
The content of the witness's statements to law enforcement as part of any interview arranged 
pursuant to the MLA will only be used or disclosed as permitted under U.S. law, including in 
connection with a criminal investigation or proceeding, as ordered or authorized by a court in 
the United States, or as otherwise required by law. 
Nothing in this agreement will bar any party from disclosing to a Court any communications related 
to setting up or executing the interview or the contents of the interview.

Before this weekend's events, I was planning on writing an email proposing that you put together 
some very specific terms for an in-person interview that we can share with the Home Office and the 
police force which makes the first formal approach to the witness's solicitors. Most of the terms are 
already noted in the MLA request: who will be present, where it will take place (UK), whether it will 
be recorded or written, etc. What isn't covered is any kind of a description or agreement about 
confidentiality. Absent this, a MLA police interview will get hung up like your efforts at a voluntary 
interview. 
This weekend's events, which are troubling on many levels, also provide an opportunity in this case. 
Blackfords's and the witness's anger have been focused on your former USA's public statements. 
They may now have some greater confidence that they can rely on any statements of confidentiality. 
Or at least they can now save face by agreeing to an interview. In any event, given the history of this, 
I think absent a mutual agreement on confidentiality, this matter will get mired in litigation, and you 
may never get the interview. 
Here is a rough outline of what might be acceptable on confidentiality. This may give you heartburn, 
but I think it is the most expeditious way forward: 
Prior to the in-person interview: 
An agreement that for a period lasting no longer than eight (8) weeks, neither the witness nor 
any person representing him will make any statement to anyone (other than counsel) about the 
plans for or terms of the interview. Likewise, the USDOJ agrees to make no public comment 
about the matter during this period. If an interview has not been concluded within eight 
weeks, this confidentiality agreement will not bar any further public or private comments on 
the matter. 
After an in-person interview: 
If the witness makes a statement, both parties may confirm publicly or privately that: "the 
witness has provided a formal statement to law enforcement authorities in the United States 
about matters under investigation. Further comment would not be appropriate." Further 
comment by the witness or any person representing or speaking for him will void this 
agreement. 
The content of witness's statement will be treated in the same manner as testimony taken 
before a Federal Grand Jury under Fed.R.Crim.P. 6(e). Among other things, unless used in 
connection with a criminal proceeding, required to be disclosed in connection with a criminal 
proceeding, or otherwise ordered disclosed by a court in the United States, the content of the 
statement will not be made public. 
Nothing in this agreement will bar any party from disclosing to a Court any communications related 
to setting up or executing the interview or the contents of the interview. 
Putting something like this together will pave the way for getting the interview done.

We dropped off the Sweden travel memo for you — we were unexpectedly significantly delayed in getting OIA approval, 
but it finally came this morning, so with apologies for the short turnaround, hoping to get Office and final DOJ

And separately, if you still wanted to meet up today, I'll be around until about 3:00, but I'm also flexible next week if

As you know, we're in the process of reviewing the Bank's electronic communications related to its relationship with 
Jeffrey Epstein. In the course of our ongoing review, we've located a chart which appears to identify Epstein's accounts at 
J.P. Morgan prior to his transition to Deutsche Bank. The chart was attached to a September 12, 2013 email from Epstein's 
accountant, Harry Beller, to Paul Morris's assistant, Amanda Kirby. The subject line of the email reads: "Let's discuss." 
There is no text in the body of the email, but we know that Epstein was transferring assets from J.P. Morgan to Deutsche 
Bank around this time. 
Notably, the chart identifies several accounts that were previously unknown to us, including a brokerage account 
belonging to the Butterfly Trust. The chart also identifies the managers of Epstein's J.P. Morgan brokerage and asset 
trading accounts. While we had previously flagged Epstein's relationship to Paul Barrett, we were previously unaware of 
Epstein's apparent relationship to Ted Serure or Laurie Cameron. As reflected in the chart, Ted Serure managed the 
Butterfly Trust account, and, according to Barron's, he still works at J.P. Morgan Securities. 
The referenced chart and email are attached. We will include a bates-stamped version of both documents in our next 
production, which we are in the process of finalizing. That production will also include a significant number of emails 
related to Darren Indyke's cash withdrawal activities. As always, we're happy to discuss if you have any questions or 
would like us to follow up further.

Good afternoon, my name is Geoffrey Berman, I am the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District 
of New York. Almost exactly one year ago today, I announced a two-count indictment of Jeffrey 
Epstein by this Office for sexually abusing young girls. 
A lot has changed since then. 
Rather than face criminal prosecution, Epstein chose — as he so often did — to act selfishly, by 
taking his own life just mere feet from here in the shadow of the very building where we 
announced his indictment. Immediately after Epstein committed his final act of cowardice, I 
announced that the search for those who enabled his hideous conduct would not end. And it 
has not. 
Epstein's suicide could not extinguish the voices or resolve of his victims, he only emboldened 
them. Rather than let him have the final word, they chose to speak. Loudly. And with their help, 
I am announcing the indictment of Ghislaine Maxwell, for [enumerate charges and detail her 
conduct] for her alleged connection to the sex crimes of Jeffrey Epstein. 
This case has been attention-getting and polarizing for so many reasons, the least of which is 
that the victims of Epstein and Maxwell refuse to remain in the shadows, and their courage and 
determination have been critical in bringing today's charges. These women have found their 
voice and I hope serve as examples for other victims of abuse to come forward. Your voices are 
being heard and you no longer need to remain in the shadows of abuse. These women deserve 
respect, empathy, compassion, and most of all, justice. 
As we stand in front of the historic federal courthouse, I'll conclude by saying that today's 
charges remind us: no matter how wealthy, powerful, or well-connected you may be, justice is 
blind in the eyes of the law, and if you abuse young women in this District, you will face justice.

UNITED STATES ATTORNEY'S OFFICE 
Southern District of New York 
U.S. ATTORNEY GEOFFREY S. BERMAN 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
Monday, July 8, 2019 
http://www.justice.gov/usao/nys 
NYPD 
CONTACT: U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE 
FBI 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN CHARGED IN MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURT 
WITH SEX TRAFFICKING OF MINORS 
Alleged Conduct Occurred in both New York and Florida over Multiple Years, 
Involving Dozens of Victims 
Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, 
., the Assistant Director in Char e of the New York Field Office of the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI"), and 
Commissioner of the New York 
City Police Department ("NYPD"), announced that JEFFREY EPSTEIN was arrested Saturday 
and charged with sex trafficking of minors and conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors. 
The indictment unsealed today alleges that, between 2002 through 2005, EPSTEIN sexually 
exploited and abused dozens of underage girls by enticing them to engage in sex acts with him in 
exchange for money. Epstein allegedly worked with several employees and associates to ensure 
that he had a steady supply of minor victims to abuse, and paid several of those victims 
themselves to recruit other underage girls to engage in similar sex acts for money. He committed 
these offenses in locations including New York, New York, and Palm Beach, Florida. EPSTEIN 
is expected to be presented in Manhattan federal court this afternoon before U.S. Magistrate 
Judge Henry B. Pitman. The case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Richard M. Berman. 
U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said: "As alleged, Jeffrey Epstein abused underage 
girls for years, operating a scheme in which girls he victimized would recruit others for Epstein 
to exploit and abuse. Epstein exploited girls who were vulnerable to abuse, enticed them with 
cash payments, and escalated his conduct to include sex acts, often occurring at his residence on 
the Upper East Side of Manhattan. While the charged conduct is from a number of years ago, 
the victims — then children and now young women — are no less entitled to their day in court. 
My Office is proud to stand up for these victims by bringing this indictment." 
EFTA00029813
--- PAGE 2 ---
FBI Assistant Director 
. said: "We are asking anyone who may 
have been victimized by Jeffrey Epstein, or anyone who may have information about his alleged 
criminal behavior, to please call us. The number is 1-800-CALL-FBI. We want to hear from 
you, regardless of the age you are now, or whatever age you were then, no matter where the 
incident took place. The bravery it takes to call us might empower others to speak out about the 
crimes committed against them. It is important to remember there was never, nor will there ever 
be an excuse for this type of behavior. In the eyes of the FBI, the victims will always come 
first." 
NYPD Commissioner 
said: "Today's charges serve as a warning to 
individuals who continue to prey upon some of our society's most vulnerable population: we are 
coming for you. I thank and commend the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District and 
the FBI for their tireless efforts to ensure child predators are taken off our streets. The NYPD 
will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to eradicate the trafficking of children 
in our city and nation and work to bring justice to victims of these heinous crimes." 
If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, 
please contact the FBI at 1-800-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
According to the Indictment' unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
From at least 2002 through at least 2005, JEFFREY EPSTEIN enticed and recruited, and 
caused to be enticed and recruited, dozens of minor girls to visit his mansion in New York, New 
York (the "New York Residence"), and his estate in Palm Beach, Florida (the "Palm Beach 
Residence"), to engage in sex acts with him, after which he would give the victims hundreds of 
dollars in cash. In order to maintain and increase his supply of victims, EPSTEIN also paid 
certain victims to recruit additional underage girls whom he could similarly abuse. In this way, 
EPSTEIN created a vast network of underage victims for him to sexually exploit, often on a 
daily basis, in locations including New York and Palm Beach. 
EPSTEIN's victims were as young as 14 at the time he abused them, and were, for 
various reasons, often particularly vulnerable to exploitation. Moreover, EPSTEIN knew that 
many of his victims were under 18, including because, in some instances, victims expressly told 
him they were underage. 
In creating and maintaining this network of minor victims in multiple states to abuse and 
exploit sexually, EPSTEIN worked with others, including employees and associates who 
facilitated his conduct by, among other things, contacting victims and scheduling their sexual 
encounters with EPSTEIN at the New York Residence and at the Palm Beach Residence. 
In both New York and Florida, EPSTEIN perpetuated this abuse in similar ways. 
Victims were initially recruited to provide "massages" to EPSTEIN, which became increasingly 
sexual in nature and would typically include one or more sex acts. EPSTEIN paid his victims 
hundreds of dollars in cash for each encounter. 
As the introductory phrase signifies, the entirety of the text of the Indictment, and the description of the Indictment 
set forth herein, constitute only allegations, and every fact described therein should be treated as an allegation. 
EFTA00029814
--- PAGE 3 ---
In particular, during encounters at the New York Residence, victims would be taken to a 
room where they would perform a massage on EPSTEIN, during which EPSTEIN would 
frequently escalate the nature and scope of physical contact with his victims to include, among 
other things, sex acts such as groping and direct and indirect contact with the victims' genitals. 
In connection with the encounters, EPSTEIN, or one of his employees or associates, typically 
paid each victim hundreds of dollars in cash. Once minor victims were recruited, EPSTEIN or 
his employees or associates would contact victims to schedule appointments for "massages." As 
a result, many victims were abused by EPSTEIN on multiple subsequent occasions. 
To further enable him to abuse underage girls, EPSTEIN asked and enticed certain of his 
victims to recruit additional minor girls to perform "massages" and similarly engage in sex acts 
with EPSTEIN. When a victim would recruit another underage girl for EPSTEIN, he paid both 
the victim-recruiter and the new victim hundreds of dollars in cash. Through these victim-
recruiters, EPSTEIN maintained a steady supply of new victims to exploit, and gained access to 
dozens of additional underage girls to abuse. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 66, is charged with one count of sex trafficking of minors, which 
carries a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison, and one count of conspiracy to engage in sex 
trafficking of minors, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
The statutory maximum and mandatory penalties are prescribed by Congress and are 
provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be 
determined by the judge. 
Mr. Berman praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and the NYPD. He 
also thanked the U.S. Customs and Border Protection for their assistance. 
This case is bein: handled b the Office's Public Corruption Unit. Assistant U.S. 
Attorneys 
are in char e of the rosecution, 
with assistance from the Office's Human Trafficking Co-Coordinator, 
The charges contained in the Indictment are merely accusations. The defendant is 
presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

Ghislaine Maxwell moves to suppress all evidence the government obtained from a grand 
jury subpoena it issued to Boies Schiller Flexner LLP and to dismiss Counts Five and Six, which 
are the fruits of that unlawful subpoena. 
INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT 
Counts Five and Six allege that Maxwell committed perjury during two civil depositions 
conducted by Boies Schiller in a defamation action it filed against Maxwell on behalf of one of 
the firm's clients. 
v. Marvell, Case No. 15-cv-7433 (LAP) (S.D.N.Y). A Protective 
Order entered in that case prohibited the parties and their lawyers from sharing confidential 
discovery material (including the two Maxwell depositions) with anyone else, including with the 
government and law enforcement. Faced with that Protective Order, the government issued a 
grand jury subpoena for Boies Schiller's file and instituted an ex parte proceeding before Chief 
Judge McMahon to modify the Protective Order. By proceeding ex parte, the government 
ensured that no one before the court would be able to contest the accuracy of its representations 
in support of its application. 
The government then took full advantage. Judge McMahon, citing this Court's decision 
in Chemical Bank v. Affiliated FM Ins. Co., 154 F.R.D. 91 (S.D.N.Y. 1994), asked the 
government, point blank, whether Southern District prosecutors had previously met with the 
Boies Schiller firm or otherwise "collu[ded]" with that firm in arranging the discovery request. 
The government lawyer assured Judge McMahon that the prosecutors had no idea what was in 
Boies Schiller's file. Indeed, he insisted, there had been no contact whatsoever between Boies 
Schiller and United States Attorney's Office before the government commenced its investigation. 
Nor, said the prosecutor, did Boies Schiller have any role instigating the Maxwell inquiry. 
EFTA00029821
--- PAGE 7 ---
To paraphrase Mary McCarthy's philippic about Lillian Hellman, every word of the 
government's representation was untrue, "including 'and' and `the."' The government knew 
what was in the Boies Schiller file; the law firm had provided that information well before the 
investigation began. The government did indeed have previous contact with (the trml. And Boiei 
Schiller was instrumental in fomenting the Maxwell prosecution. 
The record is surpassingly clear: But for the 
not, Judge McMahon 
government's misrepresentation, witting or 
never would have permitted the circumvention of the civil Protective 
Order, on which Maxwell relied in agreeing to sit for her depositions. This Court therefore has 
both the authority and the duty to suppress the fruits of that misrepresentation, including the 
deposition transcripts and the two perjury counts based on those transcripts. If the Court is 
disinclined to exercise that inherent authority on the present record, Maxwell should be granted a 
hearing to examine the circumstances that resulted in the

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

v. Maxwell 
Counts Five and Six of the superseding indictment allege that Maxwell committed 
perjury during two civil depositions taken in 
v. Maxwell, a civil defamation case 
filed in 2015. 
claimed that Maxwell defamed her when Maxwell's attorney-hired 
press agent denied as "untrue" and "obvious lies" 
numerous allegations, over the span 
of four years, that Maxwell had participated in a scheme to cause 
to be "sexually abused 
and trafficked" by Jeffrey Epstein.

, a public figure required to prove actual malice, had an uphill battle—even she 
was constrained to acknowledge that many of her public statements were false. Using a time-
honored if unfortunate litigation tactic, her lawyers at Boies Schiller therefore sought to turn the 
lawsuit into a proxy prosecution of Epstein. Not surprisingly, discovery in the case was bitter, 
hard-fought, and wide-ranging. It spanned more than a year and included large document 
productions, many responses to interrogatories, and thirty-some depositions, including 
depositions of 
and Maxwell as well as several third parties. See Brown v. Maxwell, 929 
F.3d 41, 46, 51 (2d Cir. 2019) (explaining that discovery was "hard-fought" and "extensive" and 
noting that the court file, which includes only some of the documents created during discovery, 
totals in the "thousands of pages"). 
sought and obtained a wide variety of private and confidential information about 
Maxwell and others, including information about financial and sexual matters. Brown, 929 F.3d 
at 48 n.22. Given the intimate and highly confidential nature of the discovery exchanged between 
the parties, the district court entered a stipulated Protective Order. See Ex. A. The Protective 
Order included a mechanism for one party to challenge another party's confidentiality 
designation (such a challenge never occurred) and provided that it did not apply to any 
information or material disclosed at trial. (Because the case settled before trial, that sole 
exception to the Protective Order was never triggered.) 
Notably, Boies Schiller sought to add a "law enforcement" exception to the Protective 
Order, doubtless because the firm was eager to enlist the government in its campaign against 
Maxwell. In particular, Boies Schiller proposed to include a provision stating that 
"CONFIDENTIAL information shall not be disclosed or used for any purpose except the 
preparation and trial of this case and any related matter, including but not limited to, 
investigations by law enforcement." Ex. Bil(a)(4) (emphasis supplied). Maxwell flatly rejected 
EFTA00029823
--- PAGE 9 ---
this proposal, and it was never included in the Protective Order. Ex. A.2 To the contrary, the 
order strictly limited the parties' disposition of Confidential Material, including at the conclusion 
of the case. In particular, paragraph 12 of the order provided that: 
[a]t the conclusion of this case, unless other arrangements are agreed upon, each 
document and all copies thereof which have been designated as CONFIDENTIAL 
shall be returned to the party that designated it CONFIDENTIAL, or the parties 
may elect to destroy CONFIDENTIAL documents. Where the parties agree to 
destroy CONFIDENTIAL documents, the destroying party shall provide all parties 
with an affidavit confirming destruction. 
Ex. Al 12. 
B. Maxwell's April and July 2016 depositions 
Relying on the confidentiality protections of the Protective Order, Maxwell declined to 
invoke her privilege against compulsory self-incrimination and agreed to testify at her April 
2016 deposition. In that deposition, 
attorneys asked Maxwell whether "Jeffrey Epstein 
[had] a scheme to recruit underage girls for sexual massages? If you know." Maxwell replied, "I 
don't know what you're talking about." And when asked to "[I]ist all the people under the age of 
that you interacted with at any of Jeffrey's properties," Maxwell responded, "I'm not aware of 
anybody that I interacted with, other than obviously [M
I who was 17 at this point." Count 
Five of the superseding indictment alleges those two answers were false. 
Following the deposition, 
moved to compel Maxwell to answer additional 
intimate and personal questions that she had previously declined to answer. In support of the 
motion, Boies Schiller assured the district court that "[s]uch questions are entirely appropriate in 
the discovery phase of this case, particularly where any answers will be maintained as 
confidential under the Protective Order in this case." 
'This proposal was rejected because of justifiable concerns about the misuse and abuse of this 
information by plaintiff and her lawyers including the selection and misleading leaking of confidential 
material to the media, other false claimants, and the government. 
EFTA00029824
--- PAGE 10 ---
The district court granted the motion. In requiring Maxwell to answer highly intrusive 
questions "relating to [her] own sexual activity" and "her knowledge of the sexual activity of 
others," the court held that Maxwell's "privacy concerns are alleviated by the protective order in 
this case." 
Secure in the belief that the Protective Order would be honored, Maxwell appeared at a 
second deposition. in July 2016. and answered hundreds of pages worth of questions about her 
"own sexual activity" and "her knowledge of the sexual activities of others." From the very first 
question, Maxwell discussed the intimate details of her sexual activity with Epstein, with other 
adult men, with other adult women, the use of sex toys, participation in "threesomes," and a full 
gamut of other sordid sexual topics. She was asked where she had sex, when she had sex, with 
whom she had sex, what types of sexual predilections Epstein had, whether others watched her 
having sex, whether she watched other people having sex, and whether she slept with clothes on. 
She was asked whether Epstein had sex with any number of women, and the names of women he 
might have had sex with. Maxwell was also grilled extensively about massages: when, where, 
what she was wearing, who gave them. 
Count Six of the superseding indictment alleges that Maxwell provided false testimony 
when she testified during her July 2016 deposition that: (1) she could not recall whether sex toys 
or devices were used in sexual activities at Epstein's Palm Beach house; (2) she did not know 
whether Epstein possessed sex toys or devices used in sexual activities; (3) she wasn't aware that 
Epstein was having sexual activities with anyone other than herself when she was with him; and 
(4) she never gave anyone, including Accuser-23, a massage. 
The indictment refers to the accusers as Minor Victim-I, Minor Victim-2, and Minor Victim-3. 
We will refer to them as Accuser-1, Accuser-2, and Accuser-3.

C. The Settlement And Boies Schiller's Refusal To Comply With The 
Protective Order 
In 2017, the parties settled the defamation claim, and the case was dismissed. 
v. 
Maxwell, 325 F. Supp. 3d 428, 436 (S.D.N.Y. 2018), vacated and remanded sub nom. Brown, 
929 F.3d 41. As the district court found, "a significant, if not determinative, factor" in reaching a 
settlement was its confidentiality. Id. at 446. 
After the case was settled and concluded, Maxwell repeatedly invoked Paragraph 12 of 
the Protective Order and demanded that 
either return or destroy all confidential 
information, including her deposition transcripts. Boies Schiller refused.

D. The Government's False Statements To 
discovery matena 
Judge McMahon 
Only in August 2020, after she was indicted in this case, did Maxwell finally learn that 
the government had obtained the Boies Schiller file by grand jury subpoena. Maxwell also 
learned that, to overcome the strictures of the Protective Order, the government had instituted an 
ex pane proceeding before Judge McMahon, Case No. 19-Misc.-149 (CM) (S.D.N.Y). 
Needless to say, neither Maxwell nor her attorneys were given the opportunity to oppose that 
application or to contest the government's representations in support of the application. This was 
all in direct violation of Paragraph 14 of the Protective Order, which provides that the order may 
be modified by the court only "for good cause shown following notice to all parties and an 
opportunity to be heard." Ex. A I 14 (emphasis added). 
In its ex pane application, the prosecutors professed that they had sought out Boies 
Schiller's file only because "publicly available information regarding the [ 
v. Maxwell] 
EFTA00029826
--- PAGE 12 ---
Litigation, including the complaint and other docketed filings ... appear[ed] to make reference 
to certain subjects relating to the Investigation." That "publicly available information," the 
government claimed, indicated that the Boies Schiller file might "contain information relevant to 
the ongoing Investigation" of Jeffrey Epstein. Ex. C, 4. Nowhere did the government 
acknowledge that Boies Schiller had in fact approached the prosecutors multiple times well 
before the grand jury subpoena issued. 
In March 2019, in the first appearance before Judge McMahon, the Government 
continued this refrain, professing ignorance about what was in Boies Schiller's file or who was 
deposed in the case. The prosecutor defended the subpoena's breadth—which sought all "copies 
of discovery and related materials" in 
v. Maxwell-o n the ground that the government 
simply had too little knowledge of what was in the law firm's files to craft a more narrowly 
tailored subpoena: 
Here, we are essentially unable to significantly narrow the request for information 
in part for exactly the reasons that you describe. We have either little or no 
additional information than the Court does in terms of what materials there are, who 
was deposed, and that is in marked contrast to some of the other cases. 
Ex. D, p 17. For all the government knew, according to the Assistant U.S. Attorney, what he was 
seeking was "page after page of people taking the Fifth." Ex. D. p 19. 
The government appeared a second time before Judge McMahon in April 2019. Ex. E. 
Judge McMahon held that conference for one reason: to learn "about contacts between the 
United States Attorney's Office and the Boies Schiller law firm prior to the issuance of the 
subpoena." Ex. E, p 2. The Assistant U.S. Attorney told Judge McMahon that the government's 
investigation began on either November 30 or December 3, 2018, omitting mention of any 
contacts between Boies Schiller and the government prior to that time: 
In the initial days and weeks of the investigation, we endeavored to identify 
information about the subject of the investigation, including, among other things, 
EFTA00029827
--- PAGE 13 ---
possible victims who we should speak to. In the process of doing so, we identified 
certain counsel that were identified as representing victims or witnesses either in 
public filings or in media reports. Boies Schiller was among those plaintiff 
attorneys. So following the opening of the investigation, we were in touch with 
Boies Schiller, among other plaintiff and witness counsel, in connection with their 
representation of witnesses or victims. 
With respect to Boies Schiller in particular, we quickly came to learn during 
the investigation that they had at the time either active or recently completed civil 
litigation and so asked them, as is our standard practice, told them, I should say, 
that we expected to make document requests. They generally advised us that they 
believed there was a protective order that would govern at least some of the 
materials, and that is why we ultimately made the application to the Court. 
Ex. E, 99 pp 2-3. 
Those representations were false. At the time the government claims it began the 
investigation (late November or early December 2018), its knowledge of the civil case was not 
based exclusively on public filings. It knew that Boies Schiller possessed relevant information 
because the firm had come to the government asking it to open an investigation. In particular, on 
February 29, 2016, AUSA Amanda Kramer met with attorneys from Boies Schiller, who "urged 
Kramer to open an investigation of" Epstein and Maxwell!' Then, after Maxwell's two 
depositions, David Boies himself apparently approached the government in the summer of 2016, 
asking "if the Southern District would consider charging Maxwell with perjury." Brown, supra 
n.2. Said Mr. Boies: 
"We were saying to anyone who would listen: We've got clients who were abused. 
Some of them were underage. We have the evidence. There's a whole record that's 
been developed. We can establish beyond any reasonable doubt there was a massive 
sex trafficking ring going on."

--- PAGE 14 ---
At that time, however, the government did not act. Boles "was particularly frustrated by 
the failure to pursue a perjury charge [against Maxwell]," reported one person, who recalled him 
saying, "We have her dead to rights."5 M. All of this contradicts The government's 
representations to Judge McMahon, who specifically asked if the government had any contact 
with Boies Schiller before it issued the subpoena. 
Reassured by the government that no contact had occurred, Judge McMahon modified 
the Protective Order so that Boies Schiller could comply with the subpoena. Ex. F. Judge 
McMahon found that Maxwell could not have reasonably relied on the Protective Order as 
prohibiting Boies Schiller from cooperating with the government. In making this finding, Judge 
McMahon relied on the Assistant U.S. Attorney's misrepresentations, and she distinguished the 
government's subpoena to Boies Schiller from the subpoena at issue in Chemical Bank. Said 
Judge McMahon: 
[T]he ic ting on which Maxwell or anyone else might reasonably have relied is 
that 
or her lawyers would not do what the defendant in Chemical Bank 
did—that is, forward discovery materials in their possession to prosecutors for the 
purpose of fomenting an investigation. But I am not faced with that situation. 
Nothing in this record suggests to me that 
or Boies Schiller had anything to 
do with the Government's decision to convene a grand jury to look into the matters 
that were the subject of the 
Action. On the contrary—the Government has 
advised the Court that it contacted Boies Schiller as part of its search for parties 
who might have been victims in its investigation; and that Boies Schiller told the 
Government that it could not consensually produce at least some documents in its 
files because of the existence of the Protective Order. There is no evidence of 
"collusion," to invoke a term of the moment, and it is quite clear that Boies Schiller 
did not foment the Government's investigation. Moreover, the Assistant United 
States Attorney has represented to this Court that he has no idea what is in Boies 
Schiller's files, and that for all he knows every witness who was deposed stood on 
his/her Fifth Amendment rights and refused to answer questions. 
Ex.G,p21. 
Ms. Maxwell strenuously disagrees with Mr. Boles' comments. We reference them here only to 
show their connection to the perjury counts that the government subsequently charged. 
EFTA00029829
--- PAGE 15 ---
Contrary to the government's misrepresentations, Boies Schiller did foment the 
investigation (or at least it tried to). And the evidence of "collusion" between the government 
and Boies Schiller was ample, tracing to at least early 2016 and precisely designed to have 
Maxwell charged with perjury.6piad udge McMahon known the truth, she ike y wou d have)

E. Judge Netburn Separately Rejects An Identical Gambit By The 
Government 
Around the same time that Judge McMahon granted the government's ex parte request, 
Magistrate Judge Netbum rejected an identical request from the government in a different civil 
case, Jane Doe 43 v. Epstein, Case No. 17-cv-616 (JGK) (SN). Judge Netburn recognized the 
government's conduct for what it was: an attempt to deprive Maxwell of notice and an 
opportunity to be heard. Ex. H. Indeed, Judge Netbum rebuffed the government even after it 
alerted her to Judge McMahon's order. Ex. I. As Judge Netbum found, the government's 
"abstract concern" about the "secrecy" of its investigation—a concern that exists with any 
investigation and is hardly unique to this case—could not overcome the parties' reasonable 
reliance on the Protective Order or justify the government's secret, ex parte application . Ex. H, p 
6. Judge Netburn also implicitly recognized what Judge McMahon never knew—that Boies 
Schiller was all too eager for the government to investigate and prosecute Maxwell: 
Maxwell has not yet been provided discovery of whether Boies Schiller shared actual sealed 
materials or the contents of sealed materials during its meetings with the United States Attorney's Office 
in 2016. As noted below, the bare minimum that is required here is an evidentiary hearing to probe the 
extent to which Boies Schiller "colluded," in a Chemical Bank sense, with the prosecutor's office. 
EFTA00029830
--- PAGE 16 ---
fl'The extraordinary posture of the case requires the Court to police carefully 
government intrusions into areas of protections agreed to by civil litigants and so-
ordered by the Court. The Government is attempting to side-step these protections 
by serving a subpoena only upon a party who is willing (and perhaps eager) to 
comply with the Government's investigation. 
Ex. H, p 6. 
ARGUMENT 
A. Pursuant To Its Inherent Power, This Court Should Suppress The 
Evidence Obtained From Boies Schiller, And Dismiss Counts Five And 
Six, Which Are The Fruits Of That Evidence 
1. The role of protective orders in civil litigation. 
Protective orders serve a "vital function" in civil litigation. Martindell v. Intl Tel. & Tel. 
Corp., 594 F.2d 291, 295 (2d Cir. 1979). They promote "the `secure the just, speedy, and 
inexpensive determination' of civil disputes, by encouraging full disclosure of all evidence." Id. 
(quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 1). "If protective orders were easily modified . . . parties would be less 
forthcoming in giving testimony and less willing to settle their disputes." S.E.C. v. 
TheStreet.Com, 273 F.3d 222, 230 (2d Cir. 2001). In particular, as here, "witnesses might be 
expected frequently to refuse to testify pursuant to protective orders if their testimony were to be 
made available to the Government for criminal investigatory purposes in disregard of those 
orders." Martindell, 594 F.2d at 295-96. Parties thus rely on protective orders, and courts strictly 
enforce them. See, e.g., Stewart v. Hudson Hall LLC, 20 Civ. 885 (SLC), 2020 WL 7239676, at 
*2 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 9, 2020) ("In the Second Circuit, there is a strict standard for modification of 
a protective order entered by a district court." (citation and quotation marks omitted)). 
This case illustrates just how crucial a protective order is. The Maxwell depositions 
sought highly intrusive evidence of the most personal aspects of Maxwell's life. Her sexual 
practices. Her sexual preferences. Her sexual partners. In urging the district court to permit these 
extraordinary intrusions—in what should have been a simple defamation case-Boies Schiller 
EFTA00029831
--- PAGE 17 ---
expressly invoked the assurances of the Protective Order. So did the district court in permitting 
these intrusions and ordering Maxwell to sit for a second deposition. Maxwell likewise relied on 
the Protective Order in choosing to render such intimate details, rather than assert her Fifth 
Amendment privilege as she had every right to do. 
And why shouldn't Maxwell have relied on the Protective Order? The central protection 
in the Order was that none of Maxwell's answers could be disclosed to the government. Boies 
Schiller had expressly sought a law enforcement exception but was rebuffed. Instead, the law 
firm was required either to return the confidential material or, at Maxwell's option, to destroy it. 
Maxwell had every reason to take that assurance seriously, even if Boies Schiller did not. 
2. The government circumvented the protective order. 
Faced with a duly entered Protective Order—which quite deliberately omitted any "law 
enforcement" exception—the government had lawful options to pursue the confidential 
discovery. It could have moved to intervene in the civil case and to amend the Protective Order. 
It could have issued a subpoena for the materials and given Maxwell an opportunity to respond. 
Martindell, 594 F.2d at 294. It could even have applied for a search warrant, assuming 
(counterfactually) that it could show probable cause in support of such a warrant. 
The government did none of those things. Instead. it initiated an ex parte proceeding and 
secured a secret modification of the Protective Order based on material misrepresentations to the 
presiding judge. This was not among the lawful options available to the government. 
It cannot fairly be disputed that Judge McMahon's ruling to amend the Protective Order 
was based on the government's misrepresentations. Immediately before issuing her decision, 
Judge McMahon held a hearing with the sole purpose of asking the prosecutor, point blank, 
about the government's contacts with Boies Schiller. Judge McMahon's stated reason for so 
inquiring was to ensure that the government and Boies Schiller had not coordinated as the parties 
EFTA00029832
--- PAGE 18 ---
had in the Chemical Bank case. In no uncertain terms, Judge McMahon explained why she had 
haled the prosecutor back into court: 
I'll be very up-front with you. I want to make sure I'm not in a Chemical Bank kind 
of situation, so I would like to know about contacts between the United States 
Attorney's Office and the Boies Schiller firm prior to the issuance of the subpoena 
on the subject of your investigation. 
Ex. E, p 2. 
In Chemical Bank, a protective order precluded parties to a civil case from disclosing 
confidential documents to others. 154 F.R.D. at 92-93. Despite this prohibition, counsel for the 
defendant approached the Manhattan District Attorney's Office and suggested that it had 
evidence of criminal violations relating to the case. Id. at 93. A grand jury issued a subpoena, 
and the defendant produced to the government various confidential documents without 
complying with any of the specific procedures or exceptions provided in the protective order. Id. 
Once this collusion came to light, the district court reprimanded the defendant for its "disregard 
of the [protective] order[]" and admonished its behavior as "contrary to the traditions of the Bar 
which dictate that court orders be respected." Id. 
In addressing the government's application here, Judge McMahon specifically asked 
whether Boies N',1;t11t- had acted as the defendant did in Chemical Bank. The prosecutor omitted 
any mention of his office's previous meetings with the firm, and falsely led the court to believe 
that Boies Schiller had not encouraged its investigation. Reassured by the misrepresentations, 
Judge McMahon commented: 
Nothing in this record suggests to me that 
or Boies Schiller had anything to 
do with the Government's decision to convene a grand jury to look into the matters 
that were the subject of the 
Action. On the contrary—the Government has 
advised the Court that it contacted Boies Schiller as part of its search for parties 
who might have been victims in its investigation; and that Boies Schiller told the 
Government that it could not consensually produce at least some documents in its 
files because of the existence of the Protective Order. There is no evidence of 
EFTA00029833
--- PAGE 19 ---
"collusion," to invoke a term of the moment, and it is quite clear that Boies Schiller 
did not foment the Government's investigation. 
Had Judge McMahon known the truth, she likely would not have granted the government's 
application to modify the Protective Order to allow Boies Schiller to comply with the subpoena. 
3. The government violated due process. 
The government's conduct cannot be squared with elemental due process. U.S. CONST. 
amend. V. Pursuant to this guarantee, "[t]he responsibility of a public prosecutor differs from 
that of the usual advocate; his duty is to seek justice, not merely to convict." Young v. United 
States, 481 U.S. 787, 803 (1987). The government engages in misconduct and violates due 
process when it materially misrepresents facts before a court. See United States v. Valentine, 820 
F.2d 565, 570 (2d Cir. 1987) (holding that the government violated due process and reversing 
conviction when the government mischaracterized the substance of grand jury testimony). 
The prosecutor may well have known that his representations to Judge McMahon were 
false (or at best misleading). But the Assistant U.S. Attorney's personal knowledge doesn't 
matter. "An individual prosecutor is presumed . . . to have knowledge of all information gathered 
in connection with his office's investigation of the case." United States v. Avellino, 136 F.3d 249, 
255 (2d Cir. 1998); see also Giglio v. U.S., 405 U.S. 150, 154 (1972) ("The prosecutor's office is 
an entity and as such it is the spokesman for the Government. A promise made by one attorney 
must be attributed, for these purposes, to the Government."). At the barest minimum, a federal 
prosecutor has a duty to check the entire file to ensure that his representations to a federal judge, 
submitted on behalf of the office he serves and under oath, are true and complete. The Assistant 
U.S. Attorney did not discharge that basic function. 
EFTA00029834
--- PAGE 20 ---
4. This court possesses the inherent authority to order suppression. 
Incident to its inherent power to superintend proceedings, this Court has the authority to 
suppress the fruits of the government's misrepresentation. See, e.g., United States v. Cortina, 630 
F.3d 1207, 1214 (7th Cir. 1980) ("The court has inherent authority to regulate the administration 
of criminal justice among the parties before the bar .... [by] exclud[ing] evidence taken from 
the defendant by willful disobedience of law." (citation omitted)); United States v. Iambus, 897 
F.3d 368, 386 (2d Cir. 2018) ("It is within the court's inherent authority to suppress evidence 
gathered unlawfully in order to maintain the integrity of its own proceedings . . . ."); Benkovitch 
v. Gorilla, Inc., No. 2:15-cv-7806 (WJM), 2017 WL 4005452, at *2 (D.N.J. Sept. 12, 2017) 
("District courts have `inherent authority' to impose a variety of sanctions, including ... 
suppression of evidence . . . ."). 
It does not matter that the government made its misrepresentations to Judge McMahon 
and not directly to this Court. "As long as a party receives an appropriate hearing, . . . the party 
may be sanctioned for abuses of process occurring beyond the courtroom . . ." Chambers v. 
NASCO, Inc., 510 U.S. 32, 57 (1991). "Courts have held that inherent authority sanctions may be 
imposed for misconduct in another court where the misconduct is . . . in some way related to the 
case before the sanctioning court." Klein v. Weidner, Civ. No. 08-3798, 2017 WL 2834260, at *6 
(E.D. Pa. June 30, 2017) (citation and alteration omitted); Manhattan Review LLC v. Year, 16 
Civ. 0102 (LAK) (JCF), 2017 WL 11455317, *7 n.3 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 21, 2017) ("The inherent 
power ... can punish conduct before a different court if it is intimately related to the relevant 
case." (citing Klein, 2017 WL 2834260, at *4)). Here, the government's misrepresentation to 
Judge McMahon was not simply "related" to Counts Five and Six; only by the government's 
deception was it able to obtain the factual predicate for those counts. Accordingly, the Court may 
exercise its inherent authority to suppress that evidence. And it should. 
EFTA00029835
--- PAGE 21 ---
B. At A Minimum, This Court Should Order A Hearing At Which Maxwell 
May Inquire Into The Circumstances Surrounding The Government's 
Misrepresentations To Judge McMahon 
If the Court is disinclined to grant relief on the present record, then at a minimum it 
should hold an evidentiary hearing to probe the government's misstatements to Judge McMahon 
and the extent to which the prosecutor's office had, in fact, coordinated with Boies Schiller prior 
to the issuance of the grand jury subpoena. These factual issues go directly to whether the 
predicate finding for Judge McMahon's ruling—namely, that no Chemical Bank collusion had 
occurred—was mistaken. See, e.g., United States v. Paredes-Cordova, No. SI 03 CR. 987DAB, 
2009 WL 1585776, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. June 8, 2009) ("An evidentiary hearing is normally required 
to address motions to suppress where a factual issue is in dispute."). 
An evidentiary hearing is warranted for an additional reason as well: If it turns out that 
the prosecutor knew (or was reckless in not knowing) that Boies Schiller had previously 
approached his office, both before and after the Maxwell depositions, in an effort to stir up a 
criminal prosecution and dangled the deposition transcripts as a carrot, then suppression would 
be warranted on that basis alone. Cf. Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 155-56 (1978); United 
States v. Rajaratnani, 719 F.3d 139, 146 (2d Cir. 2013) ("Franks instructs a district court to hold 
a hearing to determine whether the alleged misstatements or omissions in the warrant or wiretap 
application were made intentionally or with reckless disregard for the truth and, if so, whether 
any such misstatements or omissions were material."). 
CONCLUSION 
For these reasons, this Court should: (1) suppress all evidence the government obtained 
from Boies Schiller and any other evidence derived therefrom; or (2) suppress the April and July 
2016 depositions and all evidence derived therefrom; and (3) dismiss Counts Five and Six. 
Maxwell requests an evidentiary hearing on this Motion.

Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) 
Objection to Proposed Redactions of Government's Omnibus Response & 
Exhibit 5 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
On behalf of defendant Ghislaine Maxwell, we respectfully oppose certain of the redactions 
proposed by the government to their Omnibus Memorandum in Opposition to the Defendant's 
Pre-Trial Motions ("Response"), submitted to the Court on February 26, 2021. 
Specifically, we oppose the redactions proposed by the government contained on pages 1-128 
and 187-88 of the Response as well as certain of the redactions in Exhibit 5. We believe 
additional redactions are appropriate to pages 129-134 of the Response. We hereby attach our 
proposed redactions to pages 129-134, 187-88 and Exhibit 5. 
The Response and its Exhibits are clearly "judicial documents" presumptively subject to the 
public access rights under both the common law and First Amendment. Lugosch v. Pyramid 
Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110, 119 (2d Cir. 2006); Brown v. Maxwell, 929 F.3d 41, 49 (2d 
Cir. 2019). Ms. Maxwell also specifically asserts her right to an open and public trial 
pursuant to the Sixth Amendment. Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court (Press-Enterprise 
II), 478 U.S. 1, 7 (1986). 
Objections to Redactions Proposed on Pages 1-128 
The government's proposed redactions on pages 1-128 all relate to materially inaccurate 
statements made by a prosecutor for the government to Chief Judge McMahon. They also 
relate to a sealed proceeding in which the government circumvented decades-old precedent in 
this Circuit which held that civil litigation materials subject to a protective order cannot be 
obtained absent notice to, and an opportunity to object by, individuals with a privacy interest 
in those documents. Numerous civil litigants in the Second Circuit are negotiating protective 
orders every day in reliance on Martindell and have the right to know that the protective 
orders may be of little to no utility when their civil opponent seeks to have them used as a tool 
EFTA00029844

for a criminal prosecution against them. 
In circumstances such as these, "it is most important 'to have a measure of accountability and 
for the public to have confidence in the administration of justice.'" Lugosch, 435 F.3d at 119 
(quoting United States v. Amodeo (Amodeo II), 71 F.3d 1044, 1048 (2d Cir. 1995)). 
Although the government claims that the items must remain sealed due to an "ongoing 
investigation," they have failed to explain why. Beyond their ipse dixit pronouncement, the 
same materials they obtained via their ex pane and in camera procedure are being released to 
the public under the= 
unsealing process, without objection from the government. The 
name of the subpoena recipient (Boies Schiller) and the names of Chief Judge McMahon and 
Magistrate Judge Netburn (who issued their rulings nearly two years ago) certainly cannot 
alone compromise any such purported investigation. The government submission thus fails to 
demonstrate that denial of public access is "essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly 
tailored to serve that interest." United States v. Aref, 533 F.3d 72, 82 (2d Cir. 2008) (quoting 
Press-Enterprise II, 478 U.S. at 13-14). 
Ms. Maxwell believes that this Court has the jurisdiction in connection with this criminal case 
to determine whether to keep under seal testimony that occurred before Chief Judge 
McMahon that gave rise to this prosecution, especially as those documents have now become 
"judicial documents" by virtue of the pretrial motions in this case. If the Court prefers, 
however, Ms. Maxwell will first make application to Chief Judge McMahon to unseal those 
materials. 
Objections to Redactions Proposed on Pages 187-188 
Ms. Maxwell also objects to the government's proposed redactions on pages 187-188. The 
language at issue there concerns a diary that Accuser-2 has publicly and repeatedly claimed 
supports her allegations. Importantly, Accuser-2 read from this allegedly corroborating diary 
on a NY Times podcast. Yet now the government seeks to redact her explanation for why Ms. 
Maxwell is not mentioned once in this diary: Accuser-2 "stopped writing in her journal about 
a month after that first meeting with Epstein" and the rest of her diary is "personal in nature 
and ha[s] nothing to do with the defendant or Epstein." 
How that document, or its origin, incompleteness, or lack of corroborating content could now 
be "confidential" is unexplained by the government in its request. Certainly, Accuser-2 has 
not acted as though the contents are "confidential." 
Objections to Government's Proposed Redactions to Exhibit 5 
For similar reasons, Ms. Maxwell objects to certain of the redactions proposed by the 
government to Exhibit 5 to their Response. The materials hig '

Because 
has already publicly proclaimed the same allegations as are 
represented in the Kramer notes at 4-5, attached as Exhibit 5 to the government's Response, 
the government cannot show any privacy interest in keeping those portions redacted or sealed. 
Objections to Government's Failure to Redact Materials Under Seal in 
Litigation at 
Pages 129-134 
The government proposes, at pages 129-134, to redact only certain portions of Ms. Maxwell's 
sealed deposition testimony. Judge Preska has ruled that certain questions and answers are 
still under seal and subject to the Protective Order in the 
case. In Ms. Maxwell's 
Motions, we limited our proposed redactions to the portions of deposition testimony that 
Judge Preska has ruled should remain sealed, yet the government intends to publicize those 
sealed portions. See, e.g., 
v. Maxwell, Case No. 15-cv-7433-LAP, Dkt. 1212-1. The 
appropriate redactions which reflect Judge Preska's rulings are contained in the attached 
exhibit. 
For the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests the Court publicly docket the 
Response, with the following exceptions: 
• 
Accept Ms. Maxwell's proposed redactions to pages 129-134;' 
• 
Accept the government's proposed redactions to pages 158-186; 
•

denial. . ."). A properly instructed jury could conclude after hearing all of the evidence at trial 
that the defendant intended the natural meaning of the words she used, not the allegedly truthful 
answer she suggests now, and therefore that she lied. In sum, the defendant's post-hoc efforts to 
inject confusion into clear questioning are unavailing and should be rejected, and the jury should 
decide whether the defendant's answers were false.

Following that line of questioning, the following 
colloquy occurred: 
When you and Mr. Epstein were engaged in sexual activity that 
included these other women, were any devices or sex toys used as 
part of the sexual activity? 
A. No. 
Q. Were you ever involved in sexual activities in Mr. Epstein's Palm 
Beach house that included the use of sex toys or any kind of 
mechanical or other device? 
MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to form and foundation. 
A. No. 
Q. Were you ever involved in sexual activities in any of Mr. 
Epstein's properties other than Palm Beach that included the use of 
sex toys or any kind of mechanical or other device?

question: 
awyer asked the following 
Q. Do you know whether Mr. Epstein possessed sex toys or devices 
used in sexual activities? 
MR. PAGLIUCA: Obiection to form adation, 
A. No. 
The defendant now argues that these questions are ambiguous because they contain 
"numerous undefined terms," such as "sex toy or device" and "sexual activities." (Def. Mot. 4 at 
14). She asks, for instance, whether "bath oil" would count as a sex toy or device. (Id.). Yet this 
argument is simply another attempt to imbue ambiguity after the fact into commonly used words 
with common sense meanings. The mere fact that a term could apply equally to several different 
objects does not automatically mean that the question is impermissibly vague and can never fonn 
the basis of a perjury charge. See, e.g., H.L.A. Hart, Positivism and the Separation of Law and 
Morals, 71 Han'. L. Rev. 593, 607 (1958) ("A legal rule forbids you to take a vehicle into the 
public park. Plainly this forbids an automobile, but what about bicycles ... ?"). Instead, it is well-
settled that "[t]he jury should determine whether the question—as the declarant must have 
understood it, giving it a reasonable reading—was falsely answered." Lighte, 782 F.2d at 372. So 
130 
EFTA00029848
--- PAGE 3 ---
long as the question involves a phrase "which could be used with mutual understanding by a 
questioner and answerer," it is not fundamentally ambiguous. Id. at 375 (internal quotation matks 
omitted); see United States v. Jenkins, 727 F. App'x 732,735 (2d Cir. 2018) ("An individual of 
ordinary intelligence would not think that a question asking for information regarding `real estate, 
stocks, bonds, . . . or other valuable property' would allow omission of information regarding 
money market funds ...."). 
The use of broad or inclusive terms does not render the question fundamentally ambiguous. 
As the Second Circuit explained in the context of the term "employment activities," "[t]tle bmad 
language of the question is not fundamentally ambiguous; it is instead designed to capture all 
employment activities in an applicant's recent history." United States v. Polos, 723 F. App'x 64, 
65-66 (2d Cir. 2018). So too here. A "sex toy or device" is an intelligible phrase with an 
understood 
meaning.

The defendant's objections to the next colloquy in the indictment are similarly unavailing. 
Shortly after the above exchange, the following conversation occurred: 
O. At any time in any of Mr. Epstein's properties, did you engagenir
sexual activities with any woman other than when you had three-
!way sexual activities with Mr. Epstein? 
MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to the form. 
3 1 
EFTA00029849
--- PAGE 4 ---
A. Can you repeat the question? 
Q. At any timlitry of Mr. Epstein's properties, did you engage 
in sexual activi 
with any woman other than when you had three-
way sexual activities with Mr. Epstein? 
MR. PAGLIUCA: Same objection. 
A. No. 
Q. Other than yourself and the blond and brunette that you have 
identified as having been involved in three-way sexual activities, 
with whom did Mr. Epstein have sexual activities? 
A. I wasn't aware that he was having sexual activities with anyone 
when I was with him other than myself. 
Q. I want to be sure that I'm clear. Is it your testimony that in the 
1990s and 2000s, you were not aware that Mr. Epstein was having 
sexual activities with anyone other than yourself and the blond and 
brunette on those few occasions when they were involved with you? 
A. That is my testimony, that is correct. 
The defendant primarily argues that her answers were literally true. In the defendant's 
telling, the phrase "[w]hen I was with him," refers not to the duration of the defendant's 
relationship with Epstein, but instead to only those moments when she was in the act of having sex 
with Epstein and either the blond or brunette identified above. (Def. Mot. 4 at 16).

And in any event, 
she further argues, because the question asked the defendant about the 1990s and 2000s, it 
therefore covered any 'sexual activities' spanning more than a millennium." (Id. at 16-17). 
132 
EFTA00029850
--- PAGE 5 ---
The defendant, therefore, argues that the questioner asked whether a logically impossible 
event occurred or will occur at some point over the course of a millennium. But the defendant's 
professed confusion—which again was not raised during the deposition itself—ignores the plain 
and obvious context of the question, which did not refer to a time period far exceeding the human 
life span, and was not limited to only the times in which the defendant was in the act of having sex 
with Epstein. Plainly, a jury could find that the defendant correctly understood the question when 
she answered it in July 2016, and that she ascribed a natural meaning to the words used in the 
questions, and not the tortured illogical meaning she now assigns to those questions: whether, 
during the course of her relationship with Epstein, she was aware of anyone other than herself 
having sexual relations with Epstein. The Government expects its evidence to show that she was. 
See, e.g., Indictment I 1 (stating that the defendant "assisted, facilitated, and contributed to" 
Epstein's sexual abuse of minors). At a minimum, the defendant's answers were not"literally true 
under any conceivable interpretation of the questions." Lighte, 782 F.2d at 374. And the 
defendant's professed confusion now and proposed illogical reading of the questions in the instant 
motion does not render them fundamentally ambiguous. See Bonacorsa, 528 F.2d at 1221 ("A 
defense to a charge of perjury may not be established by isolating a statement from context, giving 
it in this manner a meaning entirely different from that which it has when the testimony is 
considered as a whole."). Accordingly, a jury should be permitted to determine what meaning the 
defendant ascribed to those questions and whether her answers were in fact false. 
Finally, the defendant answered the following questions: 
Q. Did you ever give a massage to anyone other than Mr. Epstein at 
any of Mr. Epstein's properties? 
A. First of all, I never said I gave Mr. Epstein a massage. 
133 
EFTA00029851
--- PAGE 6 ---
Q. I will ask that question if you want, but I was focusing on people 
other than Mr. Epstein right now. 
A. I don't give massages. 
Q. Let's just tie that down. It is your testimony that you've never 
given anybody a massage? 
A. I have not given anyone a massage. 
Q. You never gave Mr. Epstein a massage, is that your testimony? 
A. That is my testimony. 
Q. You never gave [Minor Victim-2] a massage is your testimony? 
A. I never gave [Minor Victim-21a massage. 
(Ex. 11 at 112:17-113:12). 
The defendant argues that these questions were fundamentally ambiguous because the 
deposition elsewhere discussed both sexual and professional massages. It was unclear, she 
explains, what kind of massage the questioner meant. (Def. Mot. 4 at 17.) The defendant's 
argument is, yet again, misguided. This line of questioning used broad language, and at no point 
during this set of questions did
ounsel suggest that the questions were limited to sexual 
or professional massages. Cf. Lighte, 782 F.2d at 376 (concluding that the word "you" was 
ambiguous when the prior two questions asked about the defendant "as an individual" and then 
switched "without indication" to the defendant "as trustee"). The defendant's answers were 
unequivocal, with no expressions of confusion or internal contradictions. Cf Markiewicz, 978 
F.2d at 809 (explaining that a question was ambiguous as to whether it asked about the deponent's 
personal or professional capacities, in light of the deponent's confusion in the next questions). A 
properly instructed jury could conclude that the defendant meant what she said: she never gave 
anyone a massage, including Epstein and Minor Victim-2.

Govemment has reviewed the full report and confirmed that there is nothing exculpatory contained 
therein. To the contrary, the report inculpates the defendant. Accordingly, the defendant is not 
entitled to its immediate disclosure. The Government will produce an unredacted version of this 
document together with all other witness statements in advance of tria1.67
Fourth, the defense requests production of pages from a personaldiary that is in the custody 
of a civilian third party and is not in the custody or control of the Government. (Def. Mot. 10 at 
10). Leaving aside the fact that the defense cites no authority for the proposition that the 
Government has an obligation to obtain the personal papers of a third party, see United States v. 
Collins, 409 F. Supp. 3d 228,239 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) ("The Government's `Brady obligations extend 
only to materials within prosecutors' possession, custody or control or, in appropriate cases, that 
of the Department of Justice, perhaps another part of the Executive Branch, or a comparable state 
authority involved in the federal prosecution.' (quoting United States v. Blaszczak, 308 F. Supp. 
3d 736, 742 (S.D.N.Y. 2018))), the Government has already represented that it has asked the third 
party at issue about the materials the defendant purports to seek and that no such materials exist 
In particular, to the extent the defense is concerned with whether there are diary entrie 
the Government has already indicated in response to the defendant's second bail 
motion that it is aware of none. (See Dkt. No. 100 at 11 n. 2 aPPeditill 
As is the case with the other redacted document referenced in this motion, the redacted copy 
defense counsel attached as Exhibit D was recovered during the execution of a search warrant for 
one of Epstein's devices and was produced to defense counsel in the form in which it was 
recovered from the device.

. In other words, the defendant again seeks supposedly exculpatory 
evidence that does not exist. The defendant offers no basis on which to conclude that this 
representation is false or that any such evidence does in fact exist. As such, this motion should be 
denied. 
Fifth, the defendant asks this Court, again without citing any legal authority, to order the 
Government to produce copies o fall subpoenas it has issued for the defendant's records as part of 
its investigation in this case. (Def. Mot. 10 at 11). This incredibly broad request is nothing more 
than a fishingexpedition inappropriately seekingthe details of investigative requests made through 
the grand jury process. The defense has cited no legal basis for the Court to direct the Government 
to provide the defense with copies of the subpoenas themselves (as opposed to records or other 
materials received in response to such subpoenas), let alone every subpoena issued for the 
defendant's records during a multi-year and ongoing grand jury investigation. The types of 
requests issued by the grand jury have no conceivable bearing on the defense or on any motion the 
defense may seek to bring. The Government has already produced to the defense all discoverable 
material that it has received in response to subpoenas issued to date during this investigation. In 
the absence of any legal authority justifying this request, it should be denied. Additionally, for the 
reasons discussed above in Sections I and IV, the defendant is not entitled to discovery or a hearing 
relating to her motion to dismiss the Indictment based on the NPA or her motion to suppress 
subpoena returns. 
Sixth, the defendant asks the Court to direct the Government to immediately disclose any 
Brady and Giglio material. (Def. Mot. 10 at 11-13). The motion for disclosure of Brady material 
should be denied as moot because the Government has conducted a search for any such material 
and has already disclosed any potentially exculpatory information in its possession of which it is

I just looked back at what we did on Epstein, because we obviously dealt with the same issue of him being arrested a day 
or two before the press conference. It looks like we kept it under seal (but gave his lawyers a copy) until Monday 
morning, and did the press conference shortly thereafter. 
That said, I don't feel strongly, particularly if she's arrested late this afternoon, and we plan to do press conference early 
tomorrow morning.

(the reporter mentioned GM, Prince Andrew and some other things, seeming to lean toward GM but not specific). He 
said they weren't running anything soon but were looking at it. FBI did not comment, and is letting their national press

spoke a bit about the case on our call on Tuesday and the truly remarkable job the team has done in bringing it. I won't 
repeat all of that, buy you should know, as you read press coverage today that already is making it seem like these charges 
were inevitable, that they were anything but, and that they are instead the result of an extraordinary amount of work and 
perseverance and creativity by 
in building a case based on conduct that I'm pretty sure is older 
than all of our paralegals. 
will be holding a press conference at 12, and while it is sadly not possible for all of us to be there to join her given 
current conditions, I hope we can all take a moment to remotely congratulate the team on a terrific accomplishment in 
bringing an extremely important case against a woman very worthy of criminal prosecution.

PURSUANT TO LOCAL

CRIMINAL RULE 16.1 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL,

Defendant. 
Cr. 330 (AJN) 
• 
 x 
I, Christian R. Everdell, an attorney duly admitted to practice in New York State and 
before this Court, declare the following is true and correct under penalty of perjury pursuant to 
U.S.C. § 1746: 
1. 
I am a partner at Cohen & Gresser LLP, counsel for defendant Ghislaine Maxwell 
in the above-captioned case. 
2. 
I certify pursuant to Local Criminal Rule 16.1 that defense counsel has conferred 
in good faith with Assistant U.S. Attorneys 
and 
regarding the government's proposed protective order pursuant 
to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16. 
3. 
While the parties have been able to agree on most of the provisions of the 
protective order, we have been unable to resolve two narrow areas of dispute. 
a. First, the defense believes that potential government witnesses and their 
counsel should be subject to the same restrictions as the defense concerning 
appropriate use of the discovery materials—namely, if these individuals are 
given access to discovery materials during trial preparation, they may not use

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 30 Filed 07/27/20 Page 2 of 2 
those materials for any purpose other than preparing for trial in the criminal 
case, and may not post those materials on the Internet. 
b. Second, the defense believes it should not be restricted from publicly 
disclosing or disseminating the identity of any alleged victims or potential 
witnesses referenced in the discovery materials who have already identified 
themselves by speaking on the public record. 
I hereby certify that the foregoing statements made by me are true. I am aware that if any of the 
foregoing statements are willfully false, I am subject to punishment.

Monday. I don't believe we ever received anything additional this past week. Are those still pending, and if so, 
when can we get those materials? 
There were three folders that were included in the first disc you provided to us, but then also provided again on 
the most recent disc. Those folders are: NYC024328, NYC024366, and NYC024392. Can you please let us know 
why those were provided twice? In particular, we need to know whether any supplemental information is in the 
new folders with those NYC numbers, or whether we can ignore them on the recent disc because we already 
received them. 
One item is listed on your spreadsheet as having been provided on 7/23, but it was not on the most recent disc 
you sent. That item is: NYC027913 (row 40 in your spreadsheet).

I don't have the evidence in front of me, but it is probably accurate. It is not unusual for the software to find such

I hope you are well and getting some time "off" this summer. I'm reaching out via email as it may be the most efficient 
way to tee-up the inquiry we have received, but we can circulate a dial-in at a convenient time for you if you'd like to 
discuss anything. 
Deutsche Bank has received a third-party subpoena from the Attorney General's Office of the U.S. Virgin Islands in 
connection with a pending civil suit they have filed against Jeffrey Epstein's estate, the executors of the estate, and 
others. One of the requests is for a copy of any government subpoenas received by the Bank relating to Epstein, and a 
copy of any productions made pursuant to the subpoenas. Do we have your permission to disclose your subpoena and 
our production to you to the U.S.V.I. AG? Would you prefer us to refer the office to you directly or provide you with 
contact information? I'm happy to send you a copy of the U.S.V.I. AG subpoena if helpful in evaluating the request.

Subject: RE: 
One of the difficulties in answering this question is that we don't have the pros memo. Here's what I've 
been able to learn from what we do have: 
We do have the transcripts of their grand jury testimony (although not the AUSA preamble). She is not 
mentioned in the introductory part of the agent's testimony where the are walking through the various 
targets and subjects of the investigation. By contrast, Epstein, 
and l
are (pp. 5-6). 
In fact, she only comes up once in the entire grand jury presentation, namely in the context of the 
agent's summary of how 
met Epstein. Specifically, the agent testifies as follows: 
I'm sorry, the question you asked me was: How did they meet? They met by a friend of Mr. 
Epstein's. Jane Doe Number One was working at Mar-a-Lago and a friend of Mr. Epstein's, 
Ghislaine Maxwell. 
Would you like the spelling? 
THE REPORTER: Yes, please. 
THE WITNESS: G-H-I-S-L-A-I-N-E, Maxwell, who was a friend of Mr. Epstein, met Jane Doe 
Number One at Mar-a-Lago and Jane Doe Number One soon after began working and providing 
massages for Mr. Epstein 
The fact that she has to spell it strongly suggests the name also didn't come up during whatever 
preamble the AUSA provided. But either way, that's it. 
As you know, she is not mentioned in the NPA and, according the lawyer at OPR who is running the NPA 
investigation, Maxwell does not come up much, if at all, in the documents they have reviewed in 
connection with that issue. 
There were no federal search warrants, so there would be no applications in which target subjects would 
be identified. There was a local search warrant, but we don't have a copy because we don't have the 
SDFL file and we haven't asked Palm Beach county for theirs. Presumably we will get that at some point. 
Maxwell was added to the caption of the FBI file at some point, and she does come up in some of the 
302s (including the 
and 
interviews in a manner we're now familiar with). 
That said, we have the FBI file, including all of their 302s, and we plan to produce those. 
I think the proposal to get the physical file from SDFL makes sense and is manageable. We'll have to 
work through how to do that, but OPR has at least some of that material which we could get quickly and 
start with (including the pros memo), and once we figure out how to get the rest, 24 boxes of material is 
a doable project.

PCU - Please join me in congratulating 
on the arrest this morning of Ghislaine Maxwell. 
spoke a bit about the case on our call on Tuesday and the truly remarkable job the team has done in bringing it. I won't 
repeat all of that, buy you should know, as you read press coverage today that already is making it seem like these charges 
were inevitable, that they were anything but, and that they are instead the result of an extraordinary amount of work and 
perseverance and creativity by 
in building a case based on conduct that I'm pretty sure is older 
than all of our paralegals. 
will be holding a press conference at 12, and while it is sadly not possible for all of us to be there to join her given 
current conditions, I hope we can all take a moment to remotely congratulate the team on a terrific accomplishment in 
bringing an extremely important case against a woman very worthy of criminal prosecution.

UNITED STATES ATTORNEY'S OFFICE 
Southern District of New York 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL CHARGED IN MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURT FOR 
CONSPIRING WITH JEFFREY EPSTEIN TO SEXUALLY ABUSE MINORS 
Maxwell is Alleged to Have Facilita- ted, Participated in Acts of Abuse 
Additionally Charged With Perjwy in Connection With 2016 Depositions 
Audrey Strauss, the Acting United States Attorney- for the Southern District of New York, William F. 
Sweeney Jr., the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation ("FBI"), and Dermot Shea, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department ("NYPD"), 
announced that GHISLANE MAXWELL was arrested this morning and charged with enticing a minor to travel 
to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, 
conspiracy to commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. The Indictment 
unsealed today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 through 1997, MAXWELL and co-conspirator 
Jeffrey Epstein exploited girls as young as 14, including by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the 
purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference for young girls, 
EFTA00029935
--- PAGE 2 ---
MAXWELL played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations 
including New York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, MAXWELL made several false 
statements in sworn depositions in 2016. MAXWELL is expected to be presented this afternoon in the in federal 
court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan. 
Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated, aided, and 
participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then 
delivered them into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust. 
All the while, she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself. 
Today, after many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the 
most important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the 
law and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth into 
behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the quest for 
justice has been met with great disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. The 
example set by the women involved has been a powerful one. They persevered against the rich and connected, 
and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a subpoena - and they stood together. I have no doubt the bravery 
exhibited by the women involved here has empowered others to speak up about the crimes of which they've been 
subjected." 
NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said: "The heinous crimes these charges allege are, and always will 
be abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement 
partners, for their continuing commitment to bringing justice to the survivors of sexual assault, everywhere." 
If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, please contact 
the FBI at 1-800-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
According to the Indictment[ I I unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated 
in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, 
which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies or 
taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at 
ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. 
Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to accept offers of 
financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. MAXWELL also 
normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, encouraging them to massage 
Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and 
susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between 
minor victims and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL 
was present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages 
during which a minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein 
involving a minor victim where MAXWELL was present. 
EFTA00029936
--- PAGE 3 ---
As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching 
of a victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to 
touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and 
Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as 
well as MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal 
sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to 
travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of 
transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, which carries a maximum sentence of 
years in prison, one count of conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual 
activity, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and two counts of perjury, each of which 
carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
The statutory maximum penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational 
purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be determined by the judge. 
Ms. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and the NYPD. 
This case is being handled by the Office's Public Corruption Unit. Assistant U.S. Attorneys 
and 
are in charge of the prosecution. 
The charges contained in the Indictment are merely accusations. The defendant is presumed innocent 
unless and until proven guilty.

Marc and Andy, 
I'm writing to ask for one point of clarification regarding the estate's position regarding the assertion of attorney-client 
privilege. You previously conveyed to us that the estate asserted privilege with respect to devices the FBI seized from 
Jeffrey Epstein's residences in New York and the USVI in 2019. We accordingly assembled a firewall team to conduct a 
privilege review of the contents of those devices. 
The FBI is also in possession of a computer that the Palm Beach Police Department seized from Epstein's residence in Palm 
Beach in 2005, which our office has not reviewed. Is the estate also asserting privilege with respect to devices such as this 
one that were seized in Florida in 2005?

We write to raise a few issues concerning the discovery. Below is the list of items. Please let me know if you are free for a 
call to discuss. 
1. On our last call, we asked you if we could send our client a hard drive containing the discovery that we had created 
(without the highly confidential items). You had said you would check to see if you could facilitate this. We have 
not heard back from you. Are you able to send Ms. Maxwell the hard drive? 
2. The last two productions you sent to Ms. Maxwell on disks. As you know, she cannot read disks on her laptop and 
must use the prison computer. But the prison computer cannot read some of the files. We can include these files 
on our hard drive to send to Ms. Maxwell. Otherwise, you will need to produce them on a hard drive. Please 
advise which way you would like to proceed. 
3. A number of the emails in the discovery — over 109,000 — were produced without their attachments (see tab 1 of 
the attached Excel file). Instead, the attachments appear as slip-sheets (see example attached). Please provide the 
missing attachments, if they exist. 
4. A number of electronic documents — over 110,000 — that were extracted from one of Epstein's devices, as identified 
by a CART number, have metadata that indicates a "date created" or "date last modified" date in July 2020 or 
afterwards (see tab 2 of the attached Excel file). We request that you produce a metadata overlay with the original 
metadata for these files. 
5. A number of photographs — over 6500 — were produced in native format, but do not have a CART number and have 
"date created" and/or "date last modified" dates after July 2019 (see tab 3 of the attached Excel file). Please 
EFTA00029942
--- PAGE 2 ---
provide the CART number for these photographs or specify which device they came from. Also, we request that 
you produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files. 
6. A number of the audio/visual files — over 460 — have similar metadata issues (see tab 4 of the attached Excel file). 
These fall into the following buckets: 
a. SDNY GM SUPP: these have CART numbers, but were produced without metadata load files and have 
"date created" and "date last modified" dates in September-November 2020, after the date the device was 
seized. We request that you produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files. 
b. SDNY005 (October 20 2020 production): these are a few videos from the SDFL or PBPD investigations that 
were produced in native form without metadata load files. They have Sept-Oct 2020 dates. We request that 
you produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files. 
c. SDNY011 (November 9 2020 production): these were produced in native form with load files, but do not 
reference a CART number and have Sept 2020 dates. We request that you provide a CART number for these 
files or indicate their source. Also, we request that you produce a metadata overlay with the original 
metadata for these files. 
7. There is a gap between 11/18 and 12/18 production numbers (SDNY_GM_02742044 to 2742183). Was that 
intentional or are we missing those documents? 
Please let us know your responses as soon as possible. 
Thanks, 
Chris

Following up on point number 7, that gap would not come in between those two productions but would instead be 
contained solely in the November 18, 2020 production. If you are missing those files, the omission was unintentional, and 
we have those files available to produce immediately. If you can send a link to your ftp site, our paralegal can upload 
those materials right away.

Chris, 
We are available for a call to discuss tomorrow between 1pm and 2pm, between 3pm and 5pm, or after 5:30pm. Please 
let us know if there is a time in those windows that would work on your end. In the meantime, below are some initial 
responses: 
1. Our supervisors have indicated that we are not permitted to send a drive that our IT department did not load to 
the MDC. As a result, we cannot provide the drive directly to the MDC. That said, I am happy to join you in asking 
the MDC to accept the drive from you. If the MDC still refuses, then my office would not object to an application to 
Judge Nathan for an order directing the MDC to accept the drive from you, though we would need to allow MDC 
legal counsel the opportunity to note their objections to Judge Nathan. 
2. The MDC recently alerted us to this issue, and our paralegal converted the excel files at issue to pdfs and sent a 
new CD with those pdfs to the MDC. If you client still cannot view them, then we are happy to load them to a drive 
if you would like to provide one for us. 
3. I have asked our vendor to look into this issue and will get back to you when I have spoken with them. 
4. I have asked our vendor to look into this issue and will get back to you when I have spoken with them. That said, 
similar to the note I sent in my email regarding highly confidential images on March 16, 2021, the electronic files 
recovered from Epstein's devices have the same metadata on the hard drive that was available when the FBI seized 
each file. For files that were carved or deleted, no metadata was recovered, so none is viewable, except for data 
showing when a particular file was saved to a drive by the investigative team or prepared for production. 
5. As indicated in our November 9, 2020 discovery letter, all images within Bates range SDNY_GM_00467566 though 
SDNY_GM_00514100 were seized during the 2019 searches of Epstein residences. These are the images from the 
CDs that were recovered during those searches, so they did not come from any of the electronic devices that were 
the subject of extractions by CART. As a result, these images would not have CART numbers. As for the metadata, I 
have asked our vendor to look into this issue and will get back to you when I have spoken with them.

We write to raise a few issues concerning the discovery. Below is the list of items. Please let me know if you are free for a 
call to discuss. 
1. On our last call, we asked you if we could send our client a hard drive containing the discovery that we had created 
(without the highly confidential items). You had said you would check to see if you could facilitate this. We have 
not heard back from you. Are you able to send Ms. Maxwell the hard drive? 
2. The last two productions you sent to Ms. Maxwell on disks. As you know, she cannot read disks on her laptop and 
must use the prison computer. But the prison computer cannot read some of the files. We can include these files 
on our hard drive to send to Ms. Maxwell. Otherwise, you will need to produce them on a hard drive. Please 
advise which way you would like to proceed. 
3. A number of the emails in the discovery — over 109,000 — were produced without their attachments (see tab 1 of 
the attached Excel file). Instead, the attachments appear as slip-sheets (see example attached). Please provide the 
missing attachments, if they exist. 
4. A number of electronic documents — over 110,000 — that were extracted from one of Epstein's devices, as identified 
by a CART number, have metadata that indicates a "date created" or "date last modified" date in July 2020 or 
afterwards (see tab 2 of the attached Excel file). We request that you produce a metadata overlay with the original 
metadata for these files. 
EFTA00029946
--- PAGE 4 ---
5. A number of photographs — over 6500 — were produced in native format, but do not have a CART number and have 
"date created" and/or "date last modified" dates after July 2019 (see tab 3 of the attached Excel file). Please 
provide the CART number for these photographs or specify which device they came from. Also, we request that 
you produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files. 
6. A number of the audio/visual files — over 460 — have similar metadata issues (see tab 4 of the attached Excel file). 
These fall into the following buckets: 
a. SDNY GM SUPP: these have CART numbers, but were produced without metadata load files and have 
"date created" and "date last modified" dates in September-November 2020, after the date the device was 
seized. We request that you produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files. 
b. SDNY005 (October 20 2020 production): these are a few videos from the SDFL or PBPD investigations that 
were produced in native form without metadata load files. They have Sept-Oct 2020 dates. We request that 
you produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files. 
c. SDNY011 (November 9 2020 production): these were produced in native form with load files, but do not 
reference a CART number and have Sept 2020 dates. We request that you provide a CART number for these 
files or indicate their source. Also, we request that you produce a metadata overlay with the original 
metadata for these files. 
7. There is a gap between 11/18 and 12/18 production numbers (SDNY_GM_02742044 to 2742183). Was that 
intentional or are we missing those documents? 
Please let us know your responses as soon as possible.

CIVIL DISCOVERY MATERIALS,

Filed 03/24/2021 
SEALED ORDER 
SARAH NETBURN United States Magistrate Judge 
*1 The United States Attorney for the Southern District of 
New York has moved, pursuant to the All Writs Act, Title 28, 
United States Code, Section 1651, for an order relieving Boies 
Schiller & Flexner LLP (the "Law Finn") of its obligations 
under the protective order issued on November 29, 2018, 
in Jane Doe 43 v. Jeffrey Epstein. et al. I7-CV-616 (IGK) 
(SN) (S.D.N.Y.). The purpose of such order is to permit the 
Law Firm to comply with a grand jury subpoena and provide 
materials to the Government in connection with a federal 
grand jury investigation. The motion is DENIED without 
prejudice. 
BACKGROUND 
The Law Firm represented Jane Doe 43, a plaintiff in a civil 
suit against Jeffrey Epstein and others. The case involves 
allegations of sex trafficking. Because of the sensitive nature 
of some of the discovery, the parties entered into a Protective 
Order that deemed certain information to be "Confidential 
Information."' Protective Order, at ECF No. 177. As 
relevant here, the Protective Order provides that Confidential 
Information shall not be disclosed or used for any purpose 
other than the civil case. Id. at 1 4. At the conclusion of 
the case, the Protective Order requires the destruction of 
Confidential hard-copy documents or electronic files. Id. at 1 
12. The Protective Order further prohibits the distribution of 
Confidential electronic non-file copies without a court order. 
Id. The Protective Order contemplates that a subpoena for 
Confidential Information may be received and precludes the 
receiving party from complying with the subpoena absent a 
court order. Id. at ¶ 13. Finally, the Protective Order permits 
modification by the Court "at any time for good cause shown 
following notice to all parties and an opportunity for them to 
be heard." Id. at 1 15. 
The United States Attorney has served a grand jury subpoena 
on the Law Firm for documents that are covered by the 
Protective Order. 2 The Government has represented that 
the subpoena was validly issued as part of an ongoing 
investigation into Jeffrey Epstein and others for possible 
violations of, Title IS, United States Code, Section 591 and 
I 594(c) (unlawfully trafficking minors) and Section 2422(b) 
(unlawfully enticing minors). The production of the materials 
pursuant to the subpoena is solely for the purposes of the 
Investigation and is subject to the protections and restrictions 
of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e). The Law Finn 
has indicated its willingness to comply with the subpoena so 
long as it is authorized to do so by a court order modifying 
the Protective Order. 
DISCUSSION 
*2 The All Writs Act provides, in relevant part, that "all 
courts established by Act of Congress may issue all writs 
necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions 
and agreeable to the usages and principles of law." 28 
U.S.C. § 1651(a). The All Writs Act permits a court, in its 
"sound judgment," to issue orders necessary "to achieve the 
rational ends of law" and "the ends of justice entrusted to 
it." 
United States v. New York Telephone Co 434 U.S. 
159, 172.73 (1977) (internal quotation marks and citations 
omitted). The All Writs Act provides a "residual source of 
authority to issue writs that are not otherwise covered by 
statute." 
Penn. Bureau of Con. v. U.S. Marshals Serv. 
474 U.S. 34, 43 (1985). "Although the Act empowers federal 
courts to fashion extraordinary remedies when the need arises, 
it does not authorize them to issue ad hoc writs whenever 
compliance with statutory procedures appears inconvenient 
or less appropriate." Id. The Court finds that it is authorized 
under the All Writs Act to modify the Protective Order. 
The Court, however, declines to exercise its discretion to 
modify the Protective Order on the record before it. Before 
modifying a protective order on which parties to a civil 
action presumptively relied, the Court of Appeals for the 
Second Circuit has directed district courts to find either 
that: (1) the protective was improvidently granted or (2) the

government has established exceptional circumstances or a 
compelling need. In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum, 
945 F.2d 1221, 1224 (2d Cir. 1991); see also ? Martindell 
v. International Tel. and Tel. Corp. 594 F.2d 291 (2d 
Cir. 1979). Because the Government does not argue that 
the Protective Order was improvidently granted (nor could 
it), and because the Government has not, on this record, 
established exceptional circumstances or a compelling need, 
the motion to modify is denied. 
The Government argues that the presumption against 
modifying protective orders articulated in Martindell and In 
re Grand Jury does not apply here for two reasons. First, the 
Government argues that the standard from those cases applies 
only to their specific procedural posture, specifically a motion 
to quash (In re Grand Jury) or an informal request without a 
grand jury subpoena (Martindell). This is a distinction without 
a difference. Nothing in those decisions cabins the rule to 
the procedural posture presented, and there is no logical 
reason to think a different standard should apply when the 
subpoena's recipient does not move to quash. If anything, 
the presumption of confidentiality applies more forcefully 
where, as is the case here, the Government's confidential 
application deprives the interested party of the chance to 
quash the subpoena. 
Second, the Government argues that the presumption does not 
apply because the Protective Order protects only documents 
exchanged in pretrial litigation. It is true that the Court of 
Appeals has said the presumption may not apply in some 
cases because the expectation of continued confidentiality 
was unreasonable. See ? SEC v. TheStreet.com 273 F.3d 
222, 231 (2d Cir. 2001) ("[S]ome protective orders may 
not merit a strong presumption against modification. For 
instance, protective orders that are on their face temporary 
or limited may not justify reliance by the parties."); see also 
In re "Agent Orange" Prod. Liah. Litig., 821 F.2d 139, 
147 (2d Cir. 1987) ("[A]ppellants ... could not have relied 
on the permanence of the protective order. The ... order by 
its very terms was applicable solely to the pretrial stages of 
the litigation."). But this is not a case where the "conditions 
contemplated by the Court for revisiting the Protective Order 
have now occurred." ? Allen v. City of N.Y. 420 F. Supp. 2d 
295, 301 (S.D.N.Y. 2006). All parties to the Protective Order 
have not been given notice and an opportunity to be heard. See 
Protective Order ¶ 15. And although the Order contemplates 
the disclosure of Confidential Information during trial, see id. 
14, that condition never arose. Instead, the parties settled, 
thereby foreclosing the possibility of atrial. Reliance on the 
continued effect of the Protective Order was and is, therefore, 
entirely reasonable. See 
SEC v. TheStreet.com 273 F.3d 
222, 230 (2d Cir. 2001) ("In some cases, settlement would not 
be possible but for the parties' reliance on a protective order.... 
Thus, another compelling reason to discourage modification 
of protective orders in civil cases is to encourage testimony in 
pre-trial discovery proceedings and to promote the settlement 
of disputes."). 
*3 In response to an identical application seeking to modify 
a protective order in a different case between Epstein and an 
alleged victim, another judge in this District has reached a 
different conclusion. That judge found that Epstein's reliance 
on the protective order in that case was not reasonable, and 
therefore modified its terms to allow the Law Firm to respond 
to the grand jury subpoena. I reach a different conclusion. 
Courts look to four factors when assessing whether reliance 
on a protective other was reasonable: "(I) the scope of the 
protective order; (2) the language of the order itself; (3) the 
level of inquiry the court undertook before granting the order, 
and (4) the nature of reliance on the order"? I  In re Ethylene 
Propylene 
255 
F.R.D. 308, 318 (D. Conn. 2009). The Protective Order is 
not a blanket order that might be disfavored; instead, the 
definition of Confidential Information is limited and subject 
to objective standards, and the parties may designate material 
only in "good faith" after attorney review. Protective Order 
113, 8. The Court entered the Protective Order after briefing, 
oral argument, and a direction from the Court to make 
modifications to their proposals. See ECF Nos. 163-177. The 
Protective Order's language also specifically contemplated 
that confidentiality would not be waived a parte where the 
government has subpoenaed documents that were exchanged 
in discovery but never used at trial. Protective Order ¶ 15 
("This Protective Order may be modified ... following notice 
to all parties and an opportunity for them to be heard."). 
Finally, no Confidential Information was filed with the Court 
after the entry of the Protective Order such that the parties 
could anticipate its public disclosure. 3 On this record, the 
Court finds that the parties' reliance on the Protective Order 
was reasonable and the presumption of confidentiality should 
apply. 
Thus the Martindell/In re Grand Jury Subpoena test applies 
here. Under that standard, the Government's arguments 
for exceptional circumstances and compelling need are

EFTA00029952
--- PAGE 3 ---
IN RE APPLICATION TO UNSEAL CIVIL DISCOVERY..., Slip Copy (2021) 
unpersuasive. The Government argues that it needs the 
protected documents because issuing subpoenas to other 
sources would alert the investigation's targets, possibly 
leading them to destroy evidence or flee prosecution. But 
the Government has not offered any affirmations or facts 
suggesting that the evidence in the Law Firm's possession 
cannot be obtained from other sources without compromising 
the investigation. Instead, it relies on the general desire 
for secrecy. That abstract concern, which applies to all 
confidential grand jury investigations, is not "a showing 
of exceptional circumstances or compelling need." In re 
Grand Jury, 945 F.2d at 1224.4 Indeed, if anything, the 
extraordinary posture of the case requires the Court to police 
carefully government intrusions into areas of protections 
agreed to by civil litigants and so-ordered by the Court. 
The Government is attempting to side-step these protections 
by serving a subpoena only upon a party who is willing 
(and perhaps eager) to comply with the Government's 
investigation. 
*4 The subject matter of the Government's investigation 
is obviously serious. But to pierce the Protective Order, the 
Government must demonstrate not that this investigation is 
an extraordinary circumstance, but that the reason for seeking 
the documents is so extraordinary or compelling that there is 
a need to modify the Protective Order. The Government has 
not met that standard. 
CONCLUSION 
The motion for an order relieving the Law Firm of its 
obligations under the Protective Order to comply with the 
grand jury's subpoena is DENIED without prejudice. This 
order does not preclude the Law Firm from producing 
material in its possession responsive to the subpoena that 
is not covered by the Protective Order. It also does not 
preclude the Law Firm from disclosing to the Government 
an inventory of material in its possession that was marked 
confidential pursuant to the Protective Order in order to allow 
the Government to renew its application to the Court to 
establish extraordinary circumstances or a compelling need 
for the materials it seeks. 
Because the Government's application is filed in connection 
with an on-going criminal investigation, this Order and all 
other documents filed within this Miscellaneous Case will 
remain UNDER SEAL until further Court Order. 
SO ORDERED.

Footnotes 
The Protective Order covers "information whose public release would violate common law and 
statutory privacy interests, including information reflecting medical or psychological conditions, medical or 
psychological treatment, prescriptions for controlled substances, non-public personal financial information, 
sexual activity or sexual contact, education records, email addresses, telephone numbers, home addresses, 
social security numbers and similarly personally identifying information for parties and third-party witnesses, 
any information subject to? I NY. Civil Rights Law § 50 or? 151, or any other information deemed private by 
a Court of competent jurisdiction to include the tort of publication of private facts." Protective Order, 1 3. 
Because the Government has not provided the Court with a copy of the subpoena, the scope of that subpoena 
is unknown. 
The other decision found that reliance on a protective order is not reasonable when the order contemplates 
that the confidential material may become public if used at trial. But that is an argument in favor of finding 
reliance on all protective orders unreasonable. The public has a strong presumption in favor of accessing 
trial documents. See Under Seal v. Under Seal, 273 F. Supp. 3d 460, 468 (S.D.N.Y. 2017) ("[The First 
Amendment] provides the public and the press a constitutional right of access to all trials, criminal or civil.") 
(citing r Richmond Newspapers. Inc. v. Virginia, 448 U.S. 555, 580 (1980)) (alterations omitted).

The Government also argues that the Confidential Information covered by the Protective Order is not the 
sort of sensitive information that has been protected in the past, such as trade secrets. The fact that the 
protected material here is not of a specific type that has arisen in prior cases does not suggest that this case 
is extraordinary.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
JANE DOE, 
Plaintiff, 
- against - 
DARREN K. INDYKE, RICHARD D. KAHN, 
AND GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 
Defendants. 
20-cv-484 (JGK) 
MEMORANDUM OPINION 
AND ORDER 
JOHN G. KOELTL, District Judge: 
The plaintiff brought this action under a pseudonym as "Jane 
Doe" against Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, in their 
capacities as appointed executors of the estate of Jeffrey E. 
Epstein (together, the "Epstein Estate"), and Ghislaine Maxwell, 
seeking declaratory relief and damages for sexual assault, sexual 
battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent 
infliction of emotional distress, and false imprisonment. The 
plaintiff now moves for dismissal pursuant to Rule 41(a)(2) of the 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. For the reasons explained below, 
the motion is granted, subject to certain conditions. 
I 
The plaintiff filed the complaint in this action on January 
17, 2020. For the purposes of this motion, the substance of the 
claims is relevant only insofar as to note that on June 29, 2020, 
Ms. Maxwell was indicted on criminal charges in this District. See 
ECF No. 1, 20-CR-330. On September 14, 2020, Magistrate Judge 
EFTA00029956
--- PAGE 2 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00484-JGK-DCF Document 98 Filed 03/08/21 Page 2 of 8 
Freeman issued an order staying this case, pending the outcome of 
the criminal prosecution of Ms. Maxwell. See ECF No. 8. 
After the complaint was filed, the Epstein Estate set up the 
Epstein Victim's Compensation Program (the "Program") and the 
administrator started accepting claims on June 25, 2020. See ECF 
No. 47. On November 29, 2020, the plaintiff accepted an offer of 
compensation from the Program, which requires her to dismiss with 
prejudice her claims against the defendants in this action. See 
ECF No. 94. To satisfy the requirement, the plaintiff sought 
dismissal with prejudice by stipulation pursuant to Rule 
41(a) (1)(A)(ii) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See ECF 
No. 87. The stipulation provided that "each party shall bear its 
own attorney's fees and costs of suit" but also that "nothing 
herein shall be construed to preclude Ms. Maxwell from seeking 
fees or costs related to this matter from the [Epstein Estate]." 
Id. at 3. While counsel for the Epstein Estate signed the 
stipulation, counsel for Ms. Maxwell declined to sign the 
stipulation. The plaintiff then filed this motion pursuant to Rule 
41(a) (2), seeking dismissal of the action with prejudice in 
accordance with the terms set forth in the partially-executed 
stipulation. 
II 
Rule 41(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 
provides that, "[e]xcept as provided in Rule 41(a)(1) [which 
describes voluntary dismissals made either before the defendant

action may be dismissed at the plaintiff's request only by court 
order, on terms that the court considers proper." Fed. R. Civ. P. 
41(a) (2); see also Paysys Int'l, Inc. v. Atos IT Servs. Ltd., 901 
F.3d 105, 108 (2d Cir. 2018).1 "Rule 41(a)(2) dismissals are at the 
district court's discretion and only will be reviewed for an abuse 
of that discretion." D'Alto v. Dahon Cal., Inc., 100 F.3d 281, 283 
(2d Cir. 1996). Once the district court articulates its terms for 
dismissal, "plaintiff . . . has the choice between accepting the 
conditions and obtaining dismissal and, if [the plaintiff] feels 
that the conditions are too burdensome, withdrawing [the 
plaintiff's] dismissal motion and proceeding with the case on the 
merits." Paysys, 901 F.3d at 109. 
III 
Ms. Maxwell objects to the plaintiff's motion to dismiss with 
prejudice insofar as the motion incorporates the terms set forth 
in the stipulation and requests that any dismissal be subject to 
two conditions. First, Ms. Maxwell requests that the provision in 
the stipulation that "each party shall bear its own attorney's 
fees and costs of suit" be stricken and that additional language 
be inserted to preserve her rights to seek her costs as the 
prevailing party in this action, and to sue plaintiff for damages 
in a subsequent action. Second, Ms. Maxwell requests that she be 
provided with the unredacted copy of the release that the 
Unless otherwise noted, this Memorandum Opinion and Order omits all 
alterations, citations, footnotes, and internal quotation marks in quoted text. 
EFTA00029958
--- PAGE 4 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00484-JGK-DCF Document 98 Filed 03/08/21 Page 4 of 8 
plaintiff has signed under the Program. The release allegedly 
includes the plaintiff's name and the compensation for the 
release. 
A 
Ms. Maxwell's request regarding costs and fees has two 
components: (1) the provision that "each party shall bear its own 
attorney's fees and costs of suit" should be stricken; and (2) the 
condition should include the language that "[n]othing herein shall 
be construed to preclude Ms. Maxwell from seeking fees or costs 
related to this matter from plaintiff or from [the Epstein 
Estate.]" See Proposed Order at 2, ECF No. 93-2. 
The provision of the stipulation that "each party shall bear 
its own attorney's fees and costs of suit" is indeed inconsistent 
with the provision in the stipulation proposed by the plaintiff 
that "nothing herein shall be construed to preclude Ms. Maxwell 
from seeking fees or costs related to this matter from the 
[Epstein Estate]." Accordingly, the provision must be modified to 
state that "the plaintiff and the Epstein Estate shall each bear 
their own attorney's fees and costs of suit." 
In addition, Ms. Maxwell also requests that the condition 
specify that she may seek fees and costs from the plaintiff in 
addition to the Epstein Estate. Ms. Maxwell argues that she is the 
prevailing party in this litigation and, pursuant to Rule 54(d), 
she should be allowed to seek costs from the plaintiff. Moreover, 
Ms. Maxwell claims she should not be prejudiced from bringing a 
EFTA00029959
--- PAGE 5 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00484-JGK-DCF Document 98 Filed 03/08/21 Page 5 of 8 
separate action against the plaintiff for damages—including 
attorney's fees incurred in this action—for the torts of abuse of 
process and malicious prosecution. Ms. Maxwell is correct that 
under Second Circuit law, she is the prevailing party for the 
purposes of Rule 54(d). See Carter v. Inc. Vill. of Ocean Beach, 
759 F.3d 159, 165-66 (2d Cir. 2014) (holding that where a 
plaintiff voluntarily dismissed its case against one defendant 
with prejudice, that defendant was a prevailing party under Rule 
54(d)). And under Rule 54(d), "costs—other than attorney's fees—
should be allowed to the prevailing party." Fed. R. Civ. P. 
54(d)(1). Therefore, a condition that precludes Ms. Maxwell from 
seeking costs from the plaintiff would prejudice her from 
exercising the rights she would normally have under Rule 54(d), 
and therefore, cannot be included. See Cross Westchester Dev. 
Corp. v. Chiulli, 887 F.2d 431, 432 (2d Cir. 1989) ("The purpose 
of authorizing terms and conditions on a voluntary dismissal is to 
protect the defendant from prejudice."). 
Furthermore, the stipulation in the amended form—that is, 
"the plaintiff and the Epstein Estate shall each bear their own 
attorney's fees and costs of suit"—should not affect Ms. Maxwell's 
ability to bring a future claim against the plaintiff for abuse of 
process or malicious prosecution. Accordingly, the condition 
related to costs and fees, in its entirely, is as follows: "The 
plaintiff and the Epstein Estate shall each bear their own 
attorney's fees and costs of suit. Nothing herein shall be 
EFTA00029960
--- PAGE 6 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00484-JGK-DCF Document 98 Filed 03/08/21 Page 6 of 8 
construed to preclude Ms. Maxwell from seeking fees or costs 
related to this matter from the Epstein Estate and from the 
plaintiff." 
With respect to the second request, Ms. Maxwell seeks to be 
provided with an unredacted copy of the release that would 
indicate who the plaintiff is and the amount of compensation that 
the plaintiff has received. On the one hand, the plaintiff has an 
understandable interest in maintaining her anonymity, and the 
Court entered an order to protect it. See ECF No. 32. On the other 
hand, it is important for Ms. Maxwell to know the name of the 
plaintiff so that if Ms. Maxwell is sued by the plaintiff, she can 
use the release as well as the dismissal with prejudice as a 
defense in that lawsuit. Further, if the plaintiff were to appear 
as a witness against Ms. Maxwell in Ms. Maxwell's criminal trial, 
it would be important for Ms. Maxwell to be able to use the 
release as possible impeachment material against the plaintiff. 
Each party's interest can be protected by requiring that the 
unredacted copy of the release be provided to Ms. Maxwell, but 
that it not be disclosed for any purpose without the prior 
approval of this Court. This will assure that the unredacted copy 
of the plaintiff's release is used only for a proper purpose. 
C 
Because the conditions added to the stipulation affect the 
rights of each of the parties, each of the parties should be given 
EFTA00029961
--- PAGE 7 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00484-JGK-DCF Document 98 Filed 03/08/21 Page 7 of 8 
an opportunity to decide whether that party is prepared to proceed 
with the dismissal as provided in the partially-executed 
stipulation and with the changes provided by the Court. Each of 
the parties must indicate that party's acceptance of the 
conditions specified by the Court by March 19, 2021. If any party 
does not agree by that date, the motion to dismiss is denied and 
the case will be stayed. If all parties agree by that date, the 
case will be dismissed with prejudice subject to the stipulation 
with the changes proposed by the Court. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court has considered all of the arguments raised by the 
parties. To the extent not specifically addressed, the arguments 
are either moot or without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the 
motion to dismiss with prejudice is granted, subject to the 
following conditions: 
(1) The plaintiff and the Epstein Estate shall each bear 
their own attorney's fees and costs of suit. Nothing 
herein shall be construed to preclude Ms. Maxwell from 
seeking fees or costs related to this matter from the 
Epstein Estate and from the plaintiff; 
(2) The plaintiff shall provide an unredacted and signed 
copy of the General Release (the "Release") the 
plaintiff executed with the Program by March 23, 2021, 
together with a certification of its authenticity. The 
Release is subject to the Order on Plaintiff's Anonymity

in this action and shall not be disclosed except 
pursuant to an Order of this Court. 
Each of the parties must indicate that party's acceptable of 
the terms of the stipulation and the additional conditions 
specified above by March 19, 2021. If any party fails to agree by 
that date, the motion to dismiss is denied and the case will be 
stayed. If all parties agree by that date, this case will be 
dismissed with prejudice, subject to the stipulation with the 
changes proposed by the Court.

Good afternoon, 
I am planning to bring a laptop and charger for inmate Ghislaine Maxwell (Reg. No. 02879-509) to use when reviewing 
discovery produced from my office. Attached please find the accompanying cover letter, which I will hand deliver with the 
laptop. I am available to make this delivery tomorrow. Would you please let me know what time I should arrive with the 
laptop? 
My understanding from 
is that I should bring the laptop to the East Building, located on 29th Street near 
3rd Avenue and that I should go to the front lobby and ask foj 
who will then come and retrieve the laptop. 
Please let me know if that is correct, or if I should take any different steps. 
As always, I can be reached on my cellphone at 
with any questions or concerns. 
Thank you,

Re: 
United States v. Chislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
The Government respectfully submits this letter in opposition to the defendant's letter of 
August 10, 2020 (the "Defense Letter" or "Def. Ltr."), requesting that the Court order the 
Government to disclose the names of certain Government witnesses 1I months prior to trial, and 
requesting that the Court intervene in the protocols and individualized inmate determinations of 
the Bureau of Prisons. Both applications should be denied. 
A. The Defendant's Demand That the Government Name Certain Trial Witnesses 
For the third time in as many weeks, the defendant and her counsel have applied to the 
Court for relief that is premature, meritless, or both. See Order dated July 23, 2020 (Dkt. 28) 
(denying the defendant's request that the Court enter an order prohibiting the Government and 
attorneys for non-parties from making extrajudicial statements "concerning this case"); Order 
dated July 30, 2020 (Dkt. 37) (denying the defendant's application for a protective order that would 
allow the defense to publicly name and identify victims). In the defendant's most recent 
application, she asks the Court to order that the Government disclose a partial witness list, in the 
form of identifying certain victims referenced in the Superseding Indictment (the "Indictment"), 
fully 11 months prior to trial. This request is at best premature given that the production of 
discovery, on the schedule agreed to by the defendant, has just begun. Moreover, the parties have 
had no discussions about—let alone asked the Court to set—a schedule for pretrial disclosures, 
including for witness lists and 3500 material. 
In the first instance, the defendant complains about the status of discovery production, 
arguing that "almost six weeks since" the arrest of the defendant, the Government is "just now 
beginning to produce Rule 16 discovery, despite confirming to the Court that discovery would 
begin as soon as the Court entered a protective order." Def. Ltr. at 2. The suggestion that the 
Government somehow delayed that initial production is nonsense. As the Court is aware, the 
EFTA00029966
--- PAGE 2 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 41 Filed 08/13/20 Page 2 of 5 
Honorable Alison J. Nathan 
August 13, 2020 
Page 2 
protective order was docketed on Friday, July 31, 2020'—the timing of which was principally the 
result of the defendant's own refusal to agree to the terms of the proposed protective order. The 
Government then promptly produced an initial discovery production totaling more than 12,000 
pages the following Wednesday, August 5, 2020. Additionally, the Government continues to 
produce discovery and earlier today made a second production, as the Government advised defense 
counsel last week it intended to do, totaling more than 150,000 pages, principally consisting of 
financial records.2 Although the Government expects to continue to produce a large amount of 
electronic discovery, the two productions already made constitute the vast majority of initial 
discovery, including search warrant applications and subpoena returns, which the Government has 
now produced more than a week in advance of its deadline of August 21, 2020, and 
approximately 11 months prior to trial. 
In sum, the Government has acted expeditiously in meeting its initial discovery obligations, 
providing more than 165,000 pages of discovery materials in less than two weeks following the 
entry of the protective order—all of which was accompanied by detailed indices describing the 
general topics and sources of the materials. 
Against this backdrop, the Defense Letter claims that over the course of just five days, 
defense counsel determined, having "expeditiously reviewed [the discovery] for high level 
content," Def. Ltr. at 2, that they cannot possibly investigate the charges against their client based 
on the materials provided thus far, and asking the Court to order the Government to provide the 
defendant with a partial witness list. That request should be denied. 
Tellingly, the defendant cites no authority that requires the relief requested at this stage in 
the litigation—i.e., prior to the completion of discovery and approximately 11 months before 
trial—nor is the Government aware of any. For example, in the lead case cited by defense counsel, 
United States v. Cannone, 528 F.2d 296, 301 (2d Cir. 1975), although the opinion acknowledged 
the ability of district courts to compel disclosure of the identity of government witnesses, the 
Second Circuit reversed for abuse of discretion the district court's decision to do so in that case 
because the defendant there, as here, had made "only an abstract, conclusory claim that such 
disclosure was necessary to its proper preparation for trial." Id. at 301-02. In United States v. 
Rueb, 00 Cr. 091 (RWS), 2001 WL 96177, at '8 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 5, 2001), while the Court ordered 
the Government to provide the defendant with its witness list, it did so one month before trial, 
following the completion of discovery production and in the context of pretrial motions. Those 
circumstances plainly are not present here. Finally, in United States v. Warme, a Western District 
of New York opinion from 2009 that has never been cited by another court, although the Court 
' The Defense Letter states that the protective order was "entered" by the Court on July 30, 2020. 
While that is the date the protective order was signed by the Court, it was posted to the docket on 
July 31, 2020. 
The Government's most recent discovery transmittal letter also included the months and years of 
birth of the three victims identified in the Indictment, to enable the defendant to evaluate whether 
she will make any motions or legal arguments—more than four months in advance of the deadline 
for any such motion—relating to the ages of the victims.

Page 3 
ordered disclosure of a certain victim identity shortly after the indictment, the Court noted that the 
Government had already confirmed to the defendant the identities of three of the four relevant 
victims, and that a fourth victim, whose identity was at issue, was the subject of a charge that failed 
to identify the date of her alleged rape or any prior encounters between the victim and the 
defendant. 2009 WL 427111, at *2. None of those facts are present here—by contrast, here, the 
Indictment particularly describes relevant time periods and events, including referring to the 
defendant's conversations with victims, interactions with victims, and specific relevant locations.' 
To the extent the defendant is arguing that she cannot identify the nature of the charges 
against her, the proper vehicle for such an argument is a motion for a bill of particulars. Any such 
motion can be made in December with all other motions and following the completion of 
discovery. While the Government anticipates opposing such a motion as baseless on the facts of 
this case, the Government respectfully submits that in any event such a motion could not be 
meaningfully evaluated at this stage, prior to the completion of discovery. See United States v. 
Mahabub, 13 Cr. 908 (AJN), 2014 WL 4243657, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 26, 2014) (denying a 
motion for a bill of particulars that sought, among other things, the "alleged victim and noting that 
"[a] bill of particulars is not required unless the charges of the indictment are so general that they 
do not advise the defendant of the specific acts of which he is accused. The government can also 
discharge its obligation to disclose this information by other means, such as by presenting evidence 
in discovery. . . . A bill of particulars is not meant to provide the details of the government's 
evidence, or to be used as an investigative tool.") (emphasis added, quotations and citations 
omitted); see also United States v. Thompson, 13 Cr. 378 (AJN), 2013 WL 6246489, at *7 
(S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3, 2013) (denying a motion for a bill of particulars and noting that such motions 
are not "a general investigative tool, a discovery device or a means to compel the government to 
disclose evidence or witnesses to be offered prior to trial") (emphasis added) (quotations and 
citation omitted); cf. United States v. Sindone, 01 Cr. 517 (MBM), 2002 WL 48604, at *2 
(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 14, 2002) (denying a motion for a bill of particulars to identify "the unnamed 
alleged victim(s)" but instructing the government to disclose the name of any victim it did not 
intend to call as a witness at trial by 14 days prior to the start of trial). 
Alternatively, to the extent defense counsel is unable to assess or comprehend the discovery 
produced by the Government, the Government is more than willing to discuss with the defense 
Defense counsel's invocation of the protective order in support of its argument, Def. Ltr. at I, 3, 
should be of little comfort. The Government is deeply concerned by the recent actions of the 
defendant's counsel who represent her in both this criminal matter as well as in certain civil 
matters, and who in a recent public filing in a civil case referred to their receipt of sealed materials 
in discovery in this case. In particular, the defendant's counsel publicly claimed in a civil filing 
that they purportedly had received "critical new information" from the criminal case that it could 
not disclose "because it is subject to a protective order in the Criminal Action," and further noting 
publicly a desire to seek modification of the protective order in this case to use such materials in 
the civil case, which the protective order expressly precludes. See Giuffre v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 
No. 15 Civ. 7433 (LAP) (Dkt. 1100). Moreover, even assuming the defendant intends to 
scrupulously adhere to the terms of the protective order, that would not change the relevant legal 
standards, which weigh heavily against granting the requested relief.

any such issues as the discovery process continues. To date, the defendant has yet to ask the 
Government a single substantive question about the discovery. The Government is also prepared 
to engage in good faith discussions with the defense about an appropriate schedule for disclosure 
of 3500 material, exhibit lists, and witness lists, all of which the Government expects to produce 
reasonably in advance of the trial date in July 2021 to permit the defense to investigate witnesses. 
But particularly given the nature of the charges, the Government's strong desire to protect the 
privacy of the alleged victims, and the lack of any legal precedent for the defendant's request, the 
Government respectfully submits that at the present time—eleven months prior to trial, nearly 
three months prior to the discovery deadline, and more than four months prior to the pretrial 
motions deadline—there is no basis for the defendant to demand the Government disclose the 
identity of its witnesses. 
B. The Defendant's Request that the Court Dictate the Conditions of Her Confinement 
The defendant's requests with respect to the conditions of her confinement at the 
Metropolitan Detention Center ("MDC") are similarly premature and unavailing, and her request 
that the Court dictate the terms of her confinement to the Bureau of Prisons ("BOP") should also 
be denied.' 
As an initial matter, the defendant's argument that she is being treated "worse" than other 
inmates is incorrect. There is no merit to her complaints about being monitored by staff, as it is 
entirely appropriate for BOP to carefully monitor any inmate, particularly a new inmate who has 
never before been incarcerated and who faces the strong likelihood of serving many years in prison. 
Additionally, like all inmates, the defendant may be subject to observation or searches of her 
person or space as appropriate.5 It is otherwise entirely unclear what specific "privileges given to 
other pretrial detainees" the defendant believes she is being denied. 
More generally, the defendant, like all pretrial inmates, is subject to an individualized 
assessment by the BOP with respect to his or her placement in a facility. Here, for reasons 
including safety, security, and the orderly functioning of the facility, BOP has made the 
determination that, at present, the defendant should not be fully integrated into the dorm-style 
accommodations of the general population. The Government understands from BOP that it will 
Once again, defense counsel has rushed to seek Court intervention on issues they have made little 
or no meaningful effort to address with the Government or, in this case, the BOP. The Government 
learned of the defendant's specific objections to her conditions of incarceration for the first time 
from the Defense Letter, and has since conferred with BOP to understand and to address the issues 
as appropriate. Moreover, as noted below, the defendant filed the instant challenge to the GOP's 
plan to permit her time to review discovery before the BOP had a chance to implement (and 
ultimately modify) that plan. 
Defense counsel claims that prison staff "constantly observe" the defendant "including her phone 
conversations with defense counsel." This is misleading. As with all inmates, the defendant is 
able to speak to her counsel behind a closed door, in an area that is visible—but not audible—to 
MDC staff. Among other reasons, this is so MDC staff can ensure that inmates do not complete 
calls with their counsel and then call other individuals on a non-recorded line.

continue to evaluate where the defendant should be housed within the facility and that the 
defendant will be placed into the general population if and when BOP is assured that such 
placement would not pose a threat to the orderly operation of the institution. The defendant 
identifies no basis for the Court to disturb that determination by the BOP, particularly given that, 
as detailed below, her housing assignment will not negatively affect her ability to review discovery 
in this case. 
Regarding the defendant's request in connection with access to discovery, the Government 
understands from BOP that the defendant had not even yet received her copy of the Government's 
first discovery production at the time the Defense Letter was filed—she received the materials on 
Tuesday, August II. While it is correct that GOP's initial plan was to provide three hours per day 
of access to the discovery—the same access that is granted to every other pretrial inmate, including 
those with trial dates scheduled for far earlier than July 2021-as of earlier this week, and given 
the volume of expected discovery, BOP informed the defendant that she will have the opportunity 
to access to her discovery from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. every day of the week. Although this 
arrangement will be subject to continued evaluation on an ongoing and individualized basis, and 
is subject to ordinary considerations of prison operations, BOP intends to provide that access on 
an ongoing basis to the extent it remains reasonably practicable to do so. Accordingly, this 
application should be denied as moot. 
C. Conclusion 
For the reasons set forth above, the defendants' requests, as set forth in the Defense Letter, 
should be denied.

MEMORANDUM 
OPINION AND ORDER 
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
On August 10, 2020, the Defendant filed a letter motion related to two issues. Dkt. No. 
38. First, the Defendant seeks an order directing the Government to disclose to defense counsel 
immediately the identities of the three alleged victims referenced in the indictment. Second, the 
Defendant seeks an order directing the Bureau of Prisons ("BOP") to release the Defendant into 
the general population and to provide her with increased access to the discovery materials. For 
the reasons that follow, Defendant's requests are DENIED without prejudice. 
I. 
The Disclosure of Alleged Victims' Identities 
The Defendant first seeks an order directing the Government to disclose to defense 
counsel immediately the identities of the three alleged victims referenced in the indictment. Dkt. 
No. 38 at I. Her request is premature. Production of discovery, which may itself identify 
alleged victims and relevant witnesses to the defense, has just begun. Moreover, the parties have 
not yet engaged in discussions regarding an appropriate schedule for pretrial disclosures, 
including witness lists and § 3500 material. The Court is mindful of the factors pointed to by the 
Defendant—in particular the fact that charges in this matter relate to conduct that allegedly took 
place many years ago—and anticipates that such a schedule would require the disclosure of 
EFTA00029971

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 49 Filed 08/25/20 Page 2 of 4 
alleged victims and witnesses substantially in advance of trial. But that alone does not justify 
such relief at this very early stage. Following the close of discovery, the parties should meet and 
confer on an appropriate schedule in light of all relevant factors. If the parties are unable to 
reach agreement as to a pretrial disclosure schedule, the Defendant may renew her request. The 
denial is therefore without prejudice. 
II. 
The Defendant's Conditions of Confinement 
In her August 10, 2020 letter motion, the Defendant also sought "an order directing 
[BOP] to release Ms. Maxwell into the general population and provide Ms. Maxwell with 
increased access to the discovery materials while she is detained so that she can meaningfully 
participate in the preparation of her defense." Dkt. No. 38 at 1. The Government responded that 
the BOP has modified the conditions of Ms. Maxwell's confinement so that she has access to 
discovery materials thirteen hours a day, seven days a week. Dkt. No. 41 at 5. The Defendant's 
reply credited the GOP's change in policy but nonetheless asked the Court to "confirm these 
changes in an order to the BOP" and "that the Court order the BOP to grant Ms. Maxwell the 
same privileges given to other detainees." Dkt. No. 42 at 4-5. 
The Court denies this request. The BOP is providing the Defendant with conditions that 
allow her access to discovery materials so that she can meaningfully participate in the 
preparation of her defense. Further action by the Court as this juncture is therefore unnecessary. 
Should facts on the ground change such that the Defendant is not being provided sufficient 
access to her legal materials, defense counsel may seek intervention by the Court. 
The Defendant also requests that the Court order BOP that Ms. Maxwell "be monitored 
in the same manner as other pretrial detainees and that the Court order the BOP to grant Ms. 
EFTA00029972
--- PAGE 3 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 49 Filed 08/25/20 Page 3 of 4 
Maxwell the same privileges given to other detainees." Dkt. No. 42 at 5. In a footnote, the 
defense clarifies that "[a]s long as Ms. Maxwell is monitored in the same manner, and receives 
the same privileges as other pretrial detainees, it is not necessary to move her to the general 
population." Dkt. No. 42 at 5 n.4. 
The Court sees no basis for granting the Defendant's request for an order directed to 
BOP. First, the Government has assured the Court that "[a]s with all inmates, the defendant is 
able to speak to her counsel behind a closed door, in an area that is visible—but not audible—to 
MDC staff," thereby ensuring that Ms. Maxwell's ability to communicate with her counsel is in 
no way interfered. Dkt. No. 41 at 4 n.5. And as to the more general implementation of 
surveillance procedures, the Court credits GOP's duty to ensure the safety and security of the 
Defendant as justifying the measures BOP has adopted. See Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 547 
(1979) ("Prison administrators ... should be accorded wide-ranging deference in the adoption 
and execution of policies and practices that in their judgment are needed to preserve internal 
order and discipline and to maintain institutional security."). Nor does the Defendant provide 
any basis for the Court to conclude that the level of surveillance is punitive. Dkt. No. 42 at 5. 
Though pretrial detainees "may not be punished prior to an adjudication of guilt in accordance 
with due process of law," Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 535, it does not follow that surveillance measures 
are punitive just because the Defendant deems them "onerous." Dkt. No. 42 at 4. The 
Defendant has provided the Court with no evidence, and no reason to believe, that the 
surveillance measures are motivated by improper purposes. 
As a result, Defendant's request is denied. To ensure that Ms. Maxwell is able to 
continue to adequately participate in her defense, however, the Court hereby ORDERS the 
Government to provide written status updates every 90 days detailing any material changes to the 
EFTA00029973
--- PAGE 4 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 49 Filed 08/25/20 Page 4 of 4 
conditions of Ms. Maxwell's confinement, with particular emphasis on her access to legal 
materials and ability to communicate with defense counsel. 
III. 
Conclusion 
For the reasons stated above, Defendant's requests contained in Dkt. No. 38 are DENIED 
without prejudice. Following the close of discovery, the parties shall meet and confer on an 
appropriate schedule for pre-trial disclosures, including the disclosure of § 3500 material, exhibit 
lists, and witness lists, taking into account all relevant factors. The Government is hereby 
ORDERED to submit written status updates every 90 days detailing any material changes to the 
conditions of Ms. Maxwell's confinement, with particular emphasis on her access to legal 
materials and ability to communicate with defense counsel. 
SO ORDERED.

Hi 
The two drives from PAE are encrypted, so I can't edit them myself and add the iPhone from the shared. I think it will be fairly easy and 
quick for me to burn two password-protected discs containing the iPhone images, so if you are okay with me doing so, I'll get started 
on that. If we produce the PAE drive and the password-protected disc, I'll change the language in the cover letter (defense's is 
attached) to reflect that.

I'd like to get the defense drive out the same day as the defendant's drive. PAE is going to make us another copy for us to keep at 1SA. 
So please tell

As an update, the PAE drive that will be delivered to Maxwell is ready to go at my desk. The password is WO-6290_20201104 and, if 
needed, I can prepare a cover letter containing the password to be included separately from the drive. 
I've given the other PAE drive to 
to start making an internal copy for us. Given the large size of data and massive amount of 
individual file paths on that drive, he estimates it will take a couple days to make the copy. If a delay in getting the drive to defense is 
an issue, we can connect with 
and see if there is another solution. 
Thanks so much! Happy to chat more about this if needed too,

make a copy of the PAE drives for us at some point this

HIM, 
This morning, I dropped off the laptop with a power cord and cover memo for Maxwell to use when reviewing her 
discovery. Attached please find a copy of the cover memo. 
I also dropped off a hard drive and CD containing a new discovery production for Maxwell. Attached please find the two 
cover letters. 
Last week, we sent out via FedEx a hard drive containing a separate production, which included replacements of 
numerous files that Maxwell has been unable to review from prior productions. The accompanying cover letters are 
attached. Would you please confirm that the drive has been provided to Maxwell? 
Thanks very much, as always, for your help.

MCC-Epstein Investigation 
andWIMiwill 
present on 
err investigation 
o 
e events at t e 
e ropo an Correctional 
Center on August 9-10, 2019, the night that Jeffrey Epstein committed 
suicide. In the last two months, our Office, along with agents from the 
FBI and DOJ-OIG, have interviewed more than 40 witnesses, including 
MCC employees and 16 inmates at MCC; reviewed records from the 
MCC as well as financial records for the relevant employees; conducted 
searches of the cellphones used by certain of the relevant prison guards, 
and reviewed dozens of hours of the limited videotape evidence the FBI 
has thus far been able to recover in the face of technical data recovery 
issues. 
The investigation has determined principally that the two prison officers 
responsible for the SHU area during the night of August 9 and early 
morning hours of August 10 — Michael Thomas and Tova Noel — did not 
conduct any of the required institutional "counts" at 12 a.m., 3 a.m., and 
a.m., nor did they conduct most of the "rounds" they were required to 
conduct every 30 minutes. In particular, it appears that no prison official 
observed Epstein from approximately 9:30 pm on the evening of August 
until his body was discovered at approximately 6:30 a.m. the next 
morning. Thomas and Noel also falsified numerous forms, indicating 
that they had performed the required rounds and counts overnight 
although they did not actually do so. Instead, Thomas and Noel were 
performing other tasks, using the computer, talking, or sleeping during 
their overnight shift. In addition, the investigation has determined that, 
contrary to MCC policy and a directive from the Chief Psychologist and 
then-Warden, Epstein was left without a cellmate from the morning of 
August 9 through his death on the morning of August 10. It is not clear 
that either Thomas or Noel was specifically made aware of the directive, 
although Thomas had been on duty in the SHU during Epstein's prior 
suicide attempt and they were both trained on MCC policy and had the 
ability to assign Epstein a new cellmate. 
The case is being handled by the Office's Public Corruption Unit, led by 
Co-Chiefs

Nine Trev Prosecution 
will be presenting on this 
important gang-violence prosecution, which culminated in a trial 
conviction last week. 
In the spring of 2018, our Office began an investigation into high-
ranking members of the Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods, a violent set of the 
Bloods gang. Working with our law enforcement partners from the 
NYPD, HSI, and ATF, the team built a racketeering case against some 
of the highest ranking and most violent members of Nine Trey. Our 
investigation resulted in charges against 14 members and associates of 
the gang, including its leaders and shooters. 
Nine Trey was responsible for distributing large amounts of heroin and 
fentanyl, as well as brazen acts of violence across New York City, 
including two shootings in Times Square, a shooting inside the Barclays 
Center, and other shootings, robberies, and slashings near residential 
housing complexes. Our investigation included the use of multiple 
cooperating witnesses, including a world-famous rap artist, who 
promoted the gang through his music and used the gang for protection 
and to taunt rivals. 
Of the 14 defendants, nine pled guilty; three pled guilty pursuant to 
cooperation agreements; and two were convicted of racketeering and 
narcotics offenses following trial. 
The case is being handled by the Office's Violent & Organized Crime 
Unit, led by Co-Chiefs

"Hard Knocks" Prosecution 
will present on this ar-reac ling sex-tratcking opera ton, 
w is t ey ave investigated and prosecuted in partnership with the FBI 
and NYPD. 
The investigation began when the FBI's Child Exploitation and Human 
Trafficking Task Force received a tip from a non-profit organization 
about the sex trafficking of minor victims in and around New York City. 
Many of these minor victims were residing, or had resided, at a particular 
foster care facility in Westchester County, the Hawthorne Residential 
Treatment Facility. The investigation expanded as minor victims 
identified other minor victims and particular pimps for whom they had 
worked, including pimps who had used significant violence to force them 
into prostitution. 
As part of this investigation, the team has charged 19 defendants in eight 
separate cases, involving dozens of victims. To date, 13 have been 
convicted, including two following jut,' trials. 
The case is being handled by the Office's General Crimes Unit, led by

Subject: JEFFREY EPSTEIN et al 
Date: Wed, 17 Jul 2019 13:08:25 +0000 
Dear Mr. Berman 
Further to my email of yesterday, I have come across some notes that someone sent me in February 
regarding North Yorkshire Police and child procurer for the elite, Jimmy Savile. The informant mentions 
ex Surrey Police officer, Mark Williams-Thomas, who is now a well-respected and reputable 
investigative journalist who has written several books. 
http://www.williams-thomas.co.uk/ 
https://www.mirrorco.uk/news/uk-news/jimmy-savile-investigator-claims-two-13510102 
As a police officer, he specialized in major crime and child abuse. I am told that Surrey police DID 
investigate allegations against Jimmy Savile but they could not pin anything on him, partly due to 
North Yorkshire Police not disclosing the information that they had on him. Mr. Williams-Thomas might 
be a helpful contact, particularly with regard to North Yorkshire Police obstruction in child abuse 
investigations. 
Also, if you managed to listen to the YOUTUBE interview with ex MI5 operative and now barrister, 
Michael Shrimpton, he alleges that Thames Valley Police, whom I believe also obstructed the 
international Project Spade, Toronto-led investigation, has (or had), German operatives (or spies) 
embedded in Thames Valley Police. Peter and Barbara Hofschroer, were seriously abused by the 
criminal activities of North Yorkshire Police. There are strong indications that North Yorkshire Police 
have close allies at extremely senior levels, in both the Austrian and German police, and the Austrian 
judiciary. I cannot say what, exactly, but have seen the results of obvious transnational criminal 
collusion. 
Regards, 
Yours sincerely, 
Jean James

A lot, when you include all the memos. Happy to combine them for you, but it strikes me that what might be

Honorable Alison J. Nathan 
United States District Judge 
United States Courthouse 
Foley Square 
New York, NY 10007 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
New York, New York 10011 
March 31, 2021 
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell 
S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
This week's filing of the second superseding indictment presents new and complicating 
issues. In addition to expanding a three-year conspiracy to 10 years, the government has added 
two serious charges that drastically change the focus of this case. That the government has made 
this move late in the game — with trial set for July 12th —is obvious tactical gamesmanship. 
Adding charges that were never launched against Jeffrey Epstein based on evidence that was in 
the government's possession for years is shocking, unfair, and an abuse of power. More than 
doubling the time period of the originally charged conspiracy from 1994 to 2004 (previously 
1997) and alleging two distinctly different substantive counts requires: additional investigation; 
requests for additional discovery; the need to supplement pretrial motions that have fully briefed 
and are pending before the Court; and the drafting and filing of additional motions pertinent to 
the new indictment. Accordingly, a new briefing schedule is required. 
Even more concerning is the impact this late-breaking filing has on Ms. Maxwell's 
constitutional rights. Her liberty interests now clash with her right to effective assistance of 
counsel. The Court is aware of the extraordinary circumstances of Ms. Maxwell's detention, its 
deleterious effect on her health and well-being, and the realistic concern whether she will be 
strong enough to withstand the stress of trial. 
Counsel have not yet determined whether to formally move for a continuance. This 
decision is not an easy one. Ms. Maxwell and her lawyers have been diligently preparing for 
trial. However, the government's continued refusal to provide the most basic discovery — names 
of accusers — coupled with what amounts to a new indictment (after what was supposed to be the 
close of discovery and the resolution of very complicated legal issues) has effectively prevented 
trial preparation from moving forward in an orderly manner. Accordingly, we have requested 
an opportunity to confer with government counsel with the goal of clarifying the necessity of 
moving the trial date.

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 192 Filed 03/31/21 Page 2 of 3 
LAW OFFICES OF 13O13131 C. STERNHEIM 
To be clear, any such request will not be made from any desire of Ms. Maxwell to delay 
her trial but rests squarely on the government's late, tactical, expansion of this prosecution. 
At the initial appearance on July 14, 2020, the defense agreed to the July 12ih trial date 
based on the government's representation that is would not file a superseding indictment: 
The trial schedule that we are agreeing to, of course subject to the court's 
approval, assumes there will be no substantive superseding indictment. If there is 
one, which the government has advised us they don't believe is imminent or I 
assume not at all, we might have to come back to the court to address not just trial 
schedule but other schedule as well. 
July 14, 2020 Transcript at 16 -17 (emphasis added). 
In response, the Court made the following inquiry: 
Let me go ahead and ask, Mss 
Mr. Cohen has made a representation but I 
will ask if you do anticipate at this time filing any further superseding indictments 
adding either defendants or additional charges? 
Id. at 17. 
The government confirmed: 
MS. 
Your Honor, our investigation remains ongoing, but at this point we 
do not currently anticipate seeking a superseding indictment. 
Id. 
Based on that representation, Ms. Maxwell accepted a July 12, 2021 trial date and her 
lawyers planned accordingly, postponing trials in other cases to preserve this high-priority date. 
It was only after considerable judicial and defense resources were expended that the government 
belatedly superseded, again, with no justifiable reason given the age of these allegations. The 
timing suggests that the decision to supersede was prompted by the filing of defense pretrial 
motions and government concern about the now-apparent weakness of its case. The government 
may be entitled to supersede but not when its decision disrupts the schedule set by the Court and 
relied on by Ms. Maxwell. This delay has a prejudicial effect on counsel's readiness for trial and 
Ms. Maxwell's prolonged detention. 
This is no longer the "two-week" trial as represented by the government. By adding 
charges that encompass dozens of additional witnesses, the government has unilaterally 
destroyed the possibility that this case can be completed in the time allotted. The continual media 
attention this case garners, in addition to podcasts, documentaries, books and the like, will likely 
require the bulk of that time to seat a fair and impartial jury, provided that constitutional right 
can be guaranteed.

LAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIM 
Ms. Maxwell is entitled to a fair trial with effective assistance of counsel. If counsel feel 
that additional time is required to guarantee those constitutional rights, Ms. Maxwell will suffer 
the consequence by her continued detention. The Court has the power — and, indeed, the 
discretion — to accommodate this constitutional clash. Granting a continuance and releasing Ms. 
Maxwell on the most restrictive conditions of home detention. Surely, the Court can impose 
conditions that "clip her wings" and satisfy perceived flight concerns without keeping Ms. 
Maxwell locked in a BOP cage. 
As counsel has notified the government, Ms. Maxwell is requesting an in-person 
arraignment. She will not waive that right, most especially in light of media coverage and the 
debacle that occurred during a remote proceeding in a related civil case before Judge Preska. 
In addition, Ms. Maxwell is requesting a bail hearing at which witnesses will testify regarding 
the purported strength of the government's case. Further, we request that these proceedings be 
scheduled to coincide with an evidence review session at the U.S. Attorney's Office to be 
attended by Ms. Maxwell with counsel. 
Your consideration is greatly appreciated. 
Very truly yours, 
gag C. 544,14.:..n.

I believe we will be able to have an attorney, investigator and paralegal present at the Bronx warehouse to take photos of 
the "excluded from transportation" items. Please let us know the particulars for that visit when you have a moment.

Good morning, 
Attached please find the revised spreadsheets, which reflect designations under the Protective Order for the three mini-
VHS tapes that I referenced below. 
I learned this morning that the Marshals intend to bring Ms. Maxwell back to the MDC each review day at 4:30pm. So we 
can plan for the review to take place at 500 Pearl Street from 9:30am to 4:30pm each day beginning on April 13th.

Subject: RE: US v. Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes 
Good evening, 
Today, the Marshals confirmed that they will produce Ms. Maxwell to 500 Pearl Street on April 13, 2021 and every day 
thereafter until the evidence review is complete. My understanding is that Ms. Maxwell should arrive to 500 Pearl Street 
at approximately 9:30am each morning. So we are confirmed for evidence review in the proffer rooms on the 5th floor of 
the 500 Pearl Street courthouse beginning at 9:30am on April 13th. I will plan to be present and to continue assisting with 
logistics. If any questions or concerns arise, please feel free to call my cellphone at 
To assist in preparing for this review, attached please find annotated versions of the three evidence spreadsheets I 
previously emailed to you: (1) a spreadsheet of New York evidence; (2) a spreadsheet of Florida evidence; and (3) a more 
detailed spreadsheet of the sub-items contained in the Florida evidence spreadsheet. A couple things to note: 
• These spreadsheets now indicate the Protective Order designation, if any, for each item to be reviewed. As you will 
see, there are three mini-VHS tapes that I need to double check before assigning a final designation. I expect to be 
able to access a mini-VHS cassette player later this week, at which point I will be able to provide an updated 
spreadsheet with a confirmed designation for those three items. Additionally, please note that there is one item 
about which we plan to provide you with a letter later this week. 
• These spreadsheets also indicate where each item will be made available for the defense to review. As you will see, 
we have now learned that one item (consisting of shredded paper) is currently at FBI headquarters and will not be 
available for review next week. Please let me know if you believe you need to review that item, and I will inquire as 
to whether and how it can be relocated to New York. Additionally, all 1D items consist of electronic data (as 
opposed to 18 items, which are physical items). As is noted in the spreadsheets, the electronic data that constitute 
the 1D items in this case have either already been produced to you in discovery (e.g., pen register data, GPS data, 
and aerial footage), or are digital recordings of interviews that will be produced as non-testifying witness 
statements. Because these 1D items are data files stored in the FBI system, there is no corresponding physical item 
to produce for you to review. 
Please let me know when you would like to schedule a time for a smaller group from the defense team to review evidence 
at the Bronx warehouse.

Laura, 
Thank you for your email and for your understanding as we work through the logistics of arranging this review. Your 
modifications and clarifications are acceptable to us. Below I address each specifically: 
• The FBI can arrange for a lawyer, investigator, and paralegal to inspect and photograph the precluded items at the 
Bronx warehouse either next week or the week after. Please let us know what day you would like to arrange for 
that inspection, and I will coordinate with the FBI accordingly. I would suggest trying to schedule this visit early 
next week if possible so that if there are items that you believe need to be produced to 500 Pearl Street, we will 
have time to do so during a subsequent day of review at 500 Pearl if the FBI agrees to transport the item(s). 
• Tomorrow, I will send you evidence spreadsheets with annotations of which items the FBI will not be producing to 
500 Pearl Street, and which items we are designating under the Protective Order. Please note that certain items 
will be designated "Confidential," in which case they may be photographed, but the photographs should be treated 
as Confidential under the Protective Order. Other items will be designated "Highly Confidential," in which case they 
may not be photographed, absent specific authorization from an AUSA. I note the possibility of authorization to 
photograph this latter category because some Highly Confidential evidence items include both nude and non-nude 
portions, in which case we would permit photography of the non-nude portions. 
• In light of our decision to produce non-testifying witness statements beginning on April 12, 2021, we are no longer 
segregating any electronic media that contain witness statements during this review. This is because all of the 
witness statements on the electronic media in the FBI's possession are from witnesses whom the Government does 
not expect to call at trial in this case. Please note that we intend to produce digital audio files to you containing the 
contents of the electronic media with these non-testifying witness statements, but you are of course welcome to 
review the original recordings themselves. 
• In terms of space, I have been informed that we will not be permitted to conduct this review in a courtroom and 
will instead be required to do so in the proffer rooms. I have reserved the two largest proffer rooms available at 
500 Pearl. We can use the largest proffer room for evidence review, and the slightly smaller proffer room as a 
private meeting space for the defense team. 
• Confirmed, I will ask the FBI to bring all electronic highly confidential images to 500 Pearl Street, including the 
2,100 that were not previously reviewed and the electronic images that were previously provided for review at the 
MDC. 
• Confirmed, I will ask the FBI to bring the 7 hard-copy highly confidential materials to 500 Pearl Street. 
As I mentioned earlier today in a separate email, the FBI and AUSAs are prepared to facilitate this review beginning April 
13th and continuing every day thereafter until your review is complete. I have also formally requested that the Marshals 
produce Ms. Maxwell to 500 Pearl Street on April 13th and every day thereafter until the review is complete. The 
Marshals previously confirmed their willingness to produce Ms. Maxwell for such a review in general, but they have not 
yet confirmed their ability to do so on any particular dates. I will let you know as soon as the Marshals inform me 
whether they can accommodate these specific dates.

Subject: RE: US v. Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes 
Thank you for your email. Your proposal is largely acceptable to us, with the following modifications and clarifications. 
• For the items that you propose below to exclude from the evidence transported to 500 Pearl Street (with the 
exception of the cash held at 26 Federal Plaza), we will need to have access for a lawyer, investigator and paralegal 
to inspect and photograph those items at the Bronx warehouse. This seems to include the bulky items, electronic 
devices and "fragile" items. 
o Once they are photographed and shared with the team and our client, we can decide whether a separate 
inspection by our client and/or any expert is necessary at a later time. To be clear, the government's photos 
of these same items are insufficient. 
o If there are any items we are not permitted to photograph (and perhaps you will be able to tell us by April 5 
which those are), we likely will need to have those transported because there is no way for our client to 
inspect the evidence. We can wait to finalize this issue until you have finished deciding what items you 
consider non-photographable, and if we can't agree, then discuss next steps. 
o Please let us know when these "non-transportable" items can be inspected and photographed at the Bronx 
warehouse. It makes sense that it would be done soon so that we can raise any issues as necessary with the 
Court. 
• For playing any of the electronic media, we will obtain the necessary equipment to play at 500 Pearl Street and 
seek permission to bring those devices into the Courthouse. You can segregate out the section of recordings that 
contain "witness statements" and advise us then which ones cannot be played, but we still need to inspect the 
outside of those recordings. 
• As far as space, can you please advise whether the largest proffer room will be available for review of evidence? It 
is my understanding that it can accommodate a large number of the team members at one time. If not, is a locked 
courtroom available for us to review the evidence? The agents could bring out a limited number of boxes at a time 
for inspection. 
• We understand that the evidence will not be taken outside of the monitoring of the agents or your staff and 
appreciate that you will have a separate room for us to consult with our client privately (without the evidence). 
• We understand that all of the highly confidential materials, including not only the 2,100 images not previously 
disclosed as well as the electronic images that were only shown to NY counsel and the client at the MDC, will be 
available for review on a singular laptop at 500 Pearl Street. 
• We also understand the 7 hard-copy highly confidential materials will also be available for inspection at 500 Pearl 
Street. 
Please let me know if you have any questions or disagree with my understanding. If you agree, we can then proceed as 
scheduled on April 12 and continue day to day until we are finished, with a break if necessary for the arraignment.

Counsel, 
Thank you for your email. Below please find our response. If this is acceptable to you, then we will proceed with 
arranging the logistics of having your client produced to 500 Pearl the week of April 12th and the week April 19th. We will 
also arrange for the FBI to transport evidence to 500 Pearl for review the week of April 12th. 
Physical Evidence 
• It is not reasonable or feasible to insist that the FBI bring all physical evidence to 500 Pearl Street. That said, we are 
certainly willing to work with you to ensure that your client can review any physical items that are material to the 
preparation of her defense. 
• We would propose excluding the below items from production to 500 Pearl: 
o We appreciate your note that the massage tables are not needed, which will certainly help with the logistics 
of transport. 
o We also appreciate your indication that the cash items from 26 Federal Plaza do not need to be produced. 
Those are the only items not located in the Bronx warehouse. 
o The FBI has seized dozens of electronic devices, including desktop computers, servers, and laptops, from 
Jeffrey Epstein's residences in 2019. Photographs of those devices were produced in our August 2020 
productions as part of the search warrant photographs, and you have received copies of the data that was 
seized from those devices pursuant to a warrant. The production of these devices would be very 
cumbersome, and we do not see any value in looking at an electronic device that cannot be turned on. 
o The framed pictures are bulky and cumbersome to transport. These are also very delicate and are difficult 
to transport. Photographs of those seized images were already provided to you as part of the photographs 
from the searches of Epstein's residences. 
o Certain items seized from the New York residence are bulky, fragile, and/or difficult to transport. These 
include plaster busts of female torsos and a stuffed dog. Photographs of these items were already provided 
to you from the search of the New York residence. 
• The remaining physical items of evidence would fit into approximately 15 to 20 boxes. The FBI has indicated that it 
would be feasible to transport those boxes to 500 Pearl Street. 
• Regarding your request for equipment that can play the recordings, we believe they would require a VCR, a cassette 
player, a CD player, an adapter for a micro VHS tape, and a microcassette player. If you wish to play these 
recordings at 500 Pearl, you will need to provide that equipment. We have asked the FBI whether any other 
equipment would be necessary and will let you know if that is the case prior to the date of your review. It is our 
understanding that any recordings that are not witness statements and that are not highly confidential have been 
produced to you in discovery. We are not aware of any discoverable, non-highly confidential, recordings that were 
not produced to you as part of the Government's discovery productions in the fall. To confirm that understanding, 
we are working with the FBI to physically doublecheck each recording. If we identify any discoverable recordings 
that have not already been produced, we will promptly provide them to you. 
EFTA00030025
--- PAGE 6 ---
• The segregation of highly confidential material will require the FBI and an AUSA to physically review each item to 
confirm the item's status. We will endeavor to do so by your requested date of April 5, 2021. 
• We can confirm that neither the AUSA(s) nor the agent(s) will record or attempt to record any part of the evidence 
review or conversations among the defense team or with the defendant during this review. Although the evidence 
cannot be left outside of the presence of an agent, we will ensure that a room is available for the defense team and 
the defendant to confer privately away from the agent(s) and the AUSA(s) without monitoring. 
• As for your request for a space large enough to fit 8 members of the defense team, the defendant, an agent, an 
AUSA, and the evidence, my office cannot control the space that the Marshals allow us to use at 500 Pearl outside 
of the proffer rooms. We will certainly request as large a space as possible, but if we are required to use the 
proffer rooms, then members of the defense team may need to rotate in and out of the room. I know members of 
the defense team have been in those proffer rooms before, and they can hopefully provide some thoughts on how 
we might use the proffer room space effectively for your purposes. If the Court grants authorization for the 
defense to bring electronic devices into 500 Pearl, that is certainly fine with the Government, and you may note our 
consent in your request to Judge Nathan for such authorization. 
Highly Confidential Electronic Images 
• The 2,100 electronic images were recovered during the responsiveness review of images and videos seized from 
Jeffrey Epstein's devices, which review was not complete until early November 2020. We indicated on page 4 the 
cover letter to our November 9, 2020 production, which included all other images and videos from those devices, 
that "the Federal Bureau of Investigation ('FBI') seized multiple nude and partially nude images from several for the 
above-listed electronic devices. All such images have been designated Highly Confidential. The FBI will make these 
images available for review by the defense upon request." We did not receive a request from the defense to review 
these images until your March 8, 2021 letter, which requested to "view and inspect all materials designated by your 
office as 'Highly Confidential' under the terms of the Protective Order". 
• We did not ask the FBI to bring the 7 hard copy images to the MDC in the fall because we did not understand you to 
be requesting a review of physical, non-electronic evidence during those meetings. Our understanding of the 
defense request at that time was to review the electronic highly confidential images that were recovered from CDs 
from Epstein's residence. We will ensure that the 7 hard copy images are available to you for review at 500 Pearl.

All, 
EFTA00030026

We have considered your proposal. Unfortunately, it does not permit us an adequate ability to review the evidence in the 
case and does not permit our client to meaningfully participate in her own defense. 
First, we are unable to meaningfully review the evidence without the benefit of our laptops and other electronic devices 
which are needed to take notes of our review. We also need access to our devices during the review to compare the 
physical evidence with the electronic discovery and with our work product. 
Second, we need to provide our client the ability to review all discovery, including any recordings, in order to assist in her 
own defense. Presuming that she will not be taken to the FBI downtown office, then your proposal offers no means by 
which she can both inspect a recording in its physical form and listen to the recording at the same time. 
In order to address the deficiencies in your proposal, we believe the following are necessary: 
Physical Evidence 
• All of the physical evidence currently located in the FBI Bronx warehouse will be transported to 500 Pearl Street 
and made available during the week of April 12, with our client present, in a room sufficiently large to 
accommodate 8 attorneys and investigators. 
o We do not need the "bulky" massage tables transported; if there are any other extremely large evidence 
pieces, let us know what they are and we can consider whether we can have someone review and 
photograph those at the Bronx warehouse at an earlier time. 
o From your email, it appears that only two items are not located at the Bronx warehouse — both envelopes 
with cash. Please confirm this. We do not need the two "cash" evidence items transported to 500 Pearl. 
o If there are other evidence items housed somewhere other than the Bronx, please let us know what they are 
and where they are. 
• We will be permitted to bring our laptops, and a camera, into 500 Pearl Street; we are happy to seek permission 
from Judge Nathan to do so. 
• Either the FBI can provide the equipment necessary to listen to any of the recordings at 500 Pearl Street or we can 
bring the necessary equipment. If we are to provide the equipment, we will need to know in advance the formats 
of each recording so that we can be prepared. You can note that on your Excel spreadsheet by the item number by 
March 29 to give us adequate time to secure the necessary equipment. 
• The FBI can segregate any physical evidence that you deem "highly confidential." You can identify any "highly 
confidential" physical evidence items on your Excel spreadsheets by April 5 (one week before the evidence view). If 
we need to photograph or reproduce any such item for expert evaluation, we will seek leave of court. Otherwise, 
we will not photograph any such items during the review during the week of April 12. This will ensure the evidence 
review proceeds smoothly and there will not be any need to ask permission to photograph on an item by item 
basis. 
• The FBI also can segregate any recordings which we will be able to inspect, but not listen to, during the evidence 
view the week of April 12. You can note such designation on your Excel spreadsheet. If we disagree, we can seek 
leave of the Court in advance. 
• We understand that an FBI Agent and/or AUSA may be present during our physical evidence review at 500 Pearl 
Street but of course must ensure that no recordings are made of our conversations and also ensure that there is a 
separate, secure room in which we can confer with our client during the evidence view without monitoring by the 
government.

Highly Confidential Electronic Evidence 
• Can you please explain why 2,100 + 7 "highly confidential" images have not been shared with us yet? It was our 
understanding that you previously provided all "highly confidential" images to our client — and to defense counsel —
for review at the MDC in November. We are confused about where these previously undisclosed items were 
located and why they have not yet been made available for inspection and review. 
• During the week of April 19, Ms. Maxwell should be produced to 500 Pearl Street to review (with counsel and a 
defense staff member, on the 1 laptop provided) all of the 5,507 electronic images and video marked "highly

confidential". These should be segregated into the three categories you describe (never-before produced, 
previously produced, and the 7 hard-copy images). 
Please let us know if you will not agree to any of these steps so that we can address the issues with the Court. 
Thank you.

Subject: RE: US v. Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes 
All, 
Attached please find two spreadsheets documenting all physical evidence in the FBI's custody, as well as a corresponding 
discovery cover letter. We are sending a copy of these files to the MDC for your client as well. 
In response to your questions, the FBI has informed me of the following: 
Regarding the Highly Confidential nude/partially nudge images to be reviewed at 500 Pearl: 
• There are three categories of these images: 
o Approximately 2,100 electronic images and videos seized from Epstein's electronic devices (which have not 
been previously provided to you) 
o Approximately 3,400 electronic images from discs seized from Epstein's residences in 2019 (which have 
previously been provided to you and your client for review at the MDC) 
o Approximately 7 hard copy nude images located in the file from the FBI Florida office's investigation of 
Epstein (which have not been previously provided to you) 
• The FBI will make all three of those categories available to you. The electronic files will be provided on hard drives, 
and the FBI will provide you with the hard copy images for review as well. 
o All electronic images should be viewable as thumbnails, except those seized from Apple devices, which must 
be viewed using Cellebrite. 
o The Cellebrite software will be provided on the drive for your review of images and videos seized from Apple 
devices. 
o The electronic files have the same metadata on the hard drive that was available when the FBI seized each 
image. For images that were carved or deleted, no metadata was recovered, so none is viewable. For all 
other images, the metadata recovered should be viewable on the hard drive. 
o The approximately 2,100 electronic images and videos seized from Epstein's devices are separated by folder 
to indicate which device each image was seized from. 
• Because these images are considered obscene material, the FBI is not permitted to make duplicates of them, and 
there is a limited number of clean laptops on which these images can be reviewed. As a result, the FBI is only able 
to provide a single laptop for review of these images. 
Regarding the physical evidence: 
• Attached are two lists of all physical items in the FBI's custody relating to this case. The first list relates to items 
associated with the FBI Florida office's investigation of Epstein. The second list relates to items associated with the 
FBI New York office's current investigation. 
EFTA00030028
--- PAGE 9 ---
• The vast majority of physical evidence in the FBI's custody is located at the FBI's warehouse in the Bronx. Two 
items (1B 77 & 1B 79) are located at 26 Federal Plaza, but the case agents can check those items out from 26 
Federal Plaza and bring them to the Bronx warehouse on whatever day you choose to conduct your review so that 
you will have all evidence in one place. 
• The FBI is able to arrange for the defense team to review all physical evidence at the Bronx warehouse under the 
following conditions: 
o The warehouse requires at least two weeks' notice in order to pull all of the items for the entire case and 
place them in a location where a large group of people can view them. 
o The warehouse is open during normal business hours between 9am and 5pm on weekdays. 
o At least two FBI agents and an AUSA will be present at the Bronx warehouse to assist and answer questions. 
o The evidence will be placed in a loading dock at the warehouse to provide additional space for the review. 
To ensure that there is sufficient space, please let me know how many members of the defense team intend 
to be physically present for this review. 
o Electronic devices such as cellphones and laptops are not permitted in the warehouse. The defense team 
may bring a digital camera that is not connected to the Internet or a cellular network into the warehouse. If 
the defense team wishes to photograph an item of evidence, the defense will need to inform the agents who 
are present, so that they may confirm that the photographed item is not Highly Confidential based on the 
presence of nudity. 
o Electronic media such as VHS tapes, cassette tapes, and CDs will not be playable at the warehouse. 
• To the extent the defense requests that the FBI bring any physical items to 500 Pearl Street for your client to review, 
the FBI is prepared to bring items that are reasonably sized to 500 Pearl Street. With respect to bulky or large 
items, the defense team should be able to photograph those for your client to review, unless they are deemed 
Highly Confidential, in which case the FBI can make arrangements to transport the item to 500 Pearl Street if 
necessary. 
• The FBI is in the process of confirming that it can provide devices to play all of the electronic media in the case in a 
single location at the FBI's offices in downtown Manhattan. We are also double-checking to confirm that all media 
that does not contain witness statements have already been produced to you and your client in discovery. The FBI 
anticipates that we can arrange for you to review all non-witness statement electronic media at the FBI's office in 
downtown Manhattan in approximately three weeks. 
o To the extent you wish to review all of the discs containing photographs, which were seized from Epstein's 
residences in 2019, we note that all of those images have already been produced to you in discovery. For 
your awareness, the FBI has informed me that it took their team several weeks to review all of the images on 
all of those discs. 
Please let me know how you wish to proceed.

Now that the FBI team is back, when do you expect to have answers to all of the questions posed? If I had an idea of 
when you would have answers, it could help me answer your question. 
At a minimum, it would not seem to take too much time to know when someone can open the FBI vault and allow the 
attorneys to make an initial view of the evidence. Also, I understand the FBI did not prepare an inventory of their 
evidence when they seized it from NY and LSJ, so I don't think we need to wait for them to now prepare an inventory 
before we start reviewing evidence. 
Also, when do you believe you will have a response regarding the discovery I requested last Monday? 
Thanks, 
Laura

Counsel, 
The FBI team on this case has been out of the office this week and will not be able to answer all of the questions you 
asked during our Wednesday call until they are back in the office next week. Please let me know if you would like to wait 
until all of those questions can be answered to schedule a day for your client to be brought to 500 Pearl Street to review 
the highly confidential images. My understanding is that the FBI is able to provide at least one laptop containing those 
highly confidential images in time for such a review to take place on Thursday 5/18, but I may not have the answers to all 
of your questions about those images before that date, and I do not know whether you will also be able to visit the 
evidence vault that same week. 
Please let me know how you would like to proceed. I will reach back out once I have answers to your questions.

That is the only excel spreadsheet indexing physical evidence that we have produced in discovery. That spreadsheet does 
not include every physical item currently in the FBI's custody related to this case. For example, the August 20, 2020 
discovery production also included search warrant returns listing the physical items seized by the FBI's New York Office 
during the 2019 searches of Jeffrey Epstein's residences in New York and the U.S Virgin Islands (see Bates range 
SDNY_GM_00166007-SDNY_GM_00166043), but they are not contained in a spreadsheet. 
As a courtesy, I have asked the FBI whether it would be possible to provide us with a similar excel index reflecting the 
physical evidence seized by the FBI's New York Office, though it may take some time to compile such an index.

Counsel, 
In advance of our call tomorrow, I wanted to send a copy of the attached index of physical items in FBI custody from the 
FBI-Miami office, which we previously produced to you as part of our August 21, 2020 discovery production. Also 
included in that August 21, 2020 production were scans of numerous items listed on the index. Those scans can be found 
within Bates range SDNY_GM_00172218-SDNY_GM_00173007. It may be useful to reference some of those items during 
our conversation tomorrow, so I wanted to make sure you were aware of them.

Chris, 
I am going to be tied up for a bit the morning on the 12th. Would it work on your end to meet at the warehouse at 11am, 
please? The warehouse will be open until 4:30pm, though I'm told I can request additional time in advance if you think 
the review will take more than 5 'A hours. 
Also, I am working on gathering information in response to Laura's email and expect to be able to respond to it later this 
evening.

My apologies, I meant to include in my previous email that we could have the Bronx view on Monday April 12. Thank you 
for the logistics. 
Regarding the spreadsheets you provided, I have several issues. 
First, there are a couple of items that you have noted for the Bronx Warehouse but will in fact need to be brought to 500 
Pearl for review because you labeled them as "Highly Confidential" and not "bulky." These appear to include: 
NY Evidence List 
• Items 16127-130 (4 boxes). 
• Item 1B13 (1 box) 
Florida Evidence List 
. Item 1, Subitem 26 — one large framed photo from Master Bedroom. 
Second, with regard to the "Bulky" photos (Florida Items 1, Subitems 8, 15a, 15b and 15c), are we permitted to 
photograph those or not? If not, we will need them transported to 500 Pearl. 
Third, Florida Item 8, Subitem 8, says it is Sixteen DVD-R Discs from PBSO but you do not indicate that we can review 
those. Why? We need to address with the Court promptly any issues related to our request to view all evidence. 
Fourth, Electronic surveillance — Your email yesterday stated that these were all "electronic files" with no corresponding 
physical item. However, for several, the chart indicates "Blu-Ray Disks;" is there a reason we cannot inspect these? 
Another Florida item is listed as "one original recording of an interview dated 4/24/07"; I am suspicious that "one original 
recording of an interview" is not truly only an "electronic" file? I was practicing law in 2007 and do not recall "electronic 
files" being the standard then. Can you please confirm? I know that Chris has written separately about the many files for 
which the metadata has apparently been stripped, so we will have to address purely electronic information at another 
date. 
Shredded Paper — Yes, we need to review that as well. 
"Missing from Assigned Box" items — can you please provide more of an explanation for all "missing items"? 
I will let you know any other issues as I see them. However, now that we have made travel plans in reliance on your 
agreement to produce all evidence items, I am hoping that you can promptly answer these questions so that we can 
resolve any of them as needed this week. 
Thank you,

Hi Laura, 
The Bronx warehouse is located at 2350 Lafayette Ave, Bronx, NY. There is plenty of street parking outside of the 
building. Whatever day you wish to have the review conducted at the warehouse, an AUSA and an agent will meet the 
attorney, investigator, and paralegal at the warehouse to escort them into the building to the evidence review room. The 
AUSA will remain present at the warehouse to answer any questions that may arise. 
The FBI has informed me that they can make the evidence available for review at the warehouse any day next week or the 
week of April 19th. Please just let me know what day you prefer, and we will coordinate with the FBI to arrange for the 
review.

Good morning, 
Attached please find the revised spreadsheets, which reflect designations under the Protective Order for the three mini-
VHS tapes that I referenced below. 
I learned this morning that the Marshals intend to bring Ms. Maxwell back to the MDC each review day at 4:30pm. So we

Good evening,

thereafter until the evidence review is complete. My understanding is that Ms. Maxwell should arrive to 500 Pearl Street 
at approximately 9:30am each morning. So we are confirmed for evidence review in the proffer rooms on the 5th floor of 
the 500 Pearl Street courthouse beginning at 9:30am on April 13th. I will plan to be present and to continue assisting with 
logistics. If any questions or concerns arise, please feel free to call my cellphone at 
To assist in preparing for this review, attached please find annotated versions of the three evidence spreadsheets I 
previously emailed to you: (1) a spreadsheet of New York evidence; (2) a spreadsheet of Florida evidence; and (3) a more 
detailed spreadsheet of the sub-items contained in the Florida evidence spreadsheet. A couple things to note: 
• These spreadsheets now indicate the Protective Order designation, if any, for each item to be reviewed. As you will 
see, there are three mini-VHS tapes that I need to double check before assigning a final designation. I expect to be 
able to access a mini-VHS cassette player later this week, at which point I will be able to provide an updated 
EFTA00030038
--- PAGE 5 ---
spreadsheet with a confirmed designation for those three items. Additionally, please note that there is one item 
about which we plan to provide you with a letter later this week. 
• These spreadsheets also indicate where each item will be made available for the defense to review. As you will see, 
we have now learned that one item (consisting of shredded paper) is currently at FBI headquarters and will not be 
available for review next week. Please let me know if you believe you need to review that item, and I will inquire as 
to whether and how it can be relocated to New York. Additionally, all 1D items consist of electronic data (as 
opposed to 1B items, which are physical items). As is noted in the spreadsheets, the electronic data that constitute 
the 1D items in this case have either already been produced to you in discovery (e.g., pen register data, GPS data, 
and aerial footage), or are digital recordings of interviews that will be produced as non-testifying witness 
statements. Because these 1D items are data files stored in the FBI system, there is no corresponding physical item 
to produce for you to review. 
Please let me know when you would like to schedule a time for a smaller group from the defense team to review evidence 
at the Bronx warehouse.

Laura, 
Thank you for your email and for your understanding as we work through the logistics of arranging this review. Your 
modifications and clarifications are acceptable to us. Below I address each specifically: 
• The FBI can arrange for a lawyer, investigator, and paralegal to inspect and photograph the precluded items at the 
Bronx warehouse either next week or the week after. Please let us know what day you would like to arrange for 
that inspection, and I will coordinate with the FBI accordingly. I would suggest trying to schedule this visit early 
next week if possible so that if there are items that you believe need to be produced to 500 Pearl Street, we will 
have time to do so during a subsequent day of review at 500 Pearl if the FBI agrees to transport the item(s). 
• Tomorrow, I will send you evidence spreadsheets with annotations of which items the FBI will not be producing to 
500 Pearl Street, and which items we are designating under the Protective Order. Please note that certain items 
will be designated "Confidential," in which case they may be photographed, but the photographs should be treated 
as Confidential under the Protective Order. Other items will be designated "Highly Confidential," in which case they 
may not be photographed, absent specific authorization from an AUSA. I note the possibility of authorization to 
photograph this latter category because some Highly Confidential evidence items include both nude and non-nude 
portions, in which case we would permit photography of the non-nude portions. 
EFTA00030039
--- PAGE 6 ---
• In light of our decision to produce non-testifying witness statements beginning on April 12, 2021, we are no longer 
segregating any electronic media that contain witness statements during this review. This is because all of the 
witness statements on the electronic media in the FBI's possession are from witnesses whom the Government does 
not expect to call at trial in this case. Please note that we intend to produce digital audio files to you containing the 
contents of the electronic media with these non-testifying witness statements, but you are of course welcome to 
review the original recordings themselves. 
• In terms of space, I have been informed that we will not be permitted to conduct this review in a courtroom and 
will instead be required to do so in the proffer rooms. I have reserved the two largest proffer rooms available at 
500 Pearl. We can use the largest proffer room for evidence review, and the slightly smaller proffer room as a 
private meeting space for the defense team. 
• Confirmed, I will ask the FBI to bring all electronic highly confidential images to 500 Pearl Street, including the 
2,100 that were not previously reviewed and the electronic images that were previously provided for review at the 
MDC. 
• Confirmed, I will ask the FBI to bring the 7 hard-copy highly confidential materials to 500 Pearl Street. 
As I mentioned earlier today in a separate email, the FBI and AUSAs are prepared to facilitate this review beginning April 
13th and continuing every day thereafter until your review is complete. I have also formally requested that the Marshals 
produce Ms. Maxwell to 500 Pearl Street on April 13th and every day thereafter until the review is complete. The 
Marshals previously confirmed their willingness to produce Ms. Maxwell for such a review in general, but they have not 
yet confirmed their ability to do so on any particular dates. I will let you know as soon as the Marshals inform me 
whether they can accommodate these specific dates.

Subject: RE: US v. Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes 
Thank you for your email. Your proposal is largely acceptable to us, with the following modifications and clarifications. 
• For the items that you propose below to exclude from the evidence transported to 500 Pearl Street (with the 
exception of the cash held at 26 Federal Plaza), we will need to have access for a lawyer, investigator and paralegal 
to inspect and photograph those items at the Bronx warehouse. This seems to include the bulky items, electronic 
devices and "fragile" items. 
o Once they are photographed and shared with the team and our client, we can decide whether a separate 
inspection by our client and/or any expert is necessary at a later time. To be clear, the government's photos 
of these same items are insufficient. 
EFTA00030040
--- PAGE 7 ---
o If there are any items we are not permitted to photograph (and perhaps you will be able to tell us by April 5 
which those are), we likely will need to have those transported because there is no way for our client to 
inspect the evidence. We can wait to finalize this issue until you have finished deciding what items you 
consider non-photographable, and if we can't agree, then discuss next steps. 
o Please let us know when these "non-transportable" items can be inspected and photographed at the Bronx 
warehouse. It makes sense that it would be done soon so that we can raise any issues as necessary with the 
Court. 
• For playing any of the electronic media, we will obtain the necessary equipment to play at 500 Pearl Street and 
seek permission to bring those devices into the Courthouse. You can segregate out the section of recordings that 
contain "witness statements" and advise us then which ones cannot be played, but we still need to inspect the 
outside of those recordings. 
• As far as space, can you please advise whether the largest proffer room will be available for review of evidence? It 
is my understanding that it can accommodate a large number of the team members at one time. If not, is a locked 
courtroom available for us to review the evidence? The agents could bring out a limited number of boxes at a time 
for inspection. 
• We understand that the evidence will not be taken outside of the monitoring of the agents or your staff and 
appreciate that you will have a separate room for us to consult with our client privately (without the evidence). 
• We understand that all of the highly confidential materials, including not only the 2,100 images not previously 
disclosed as well as the electronic images that were only shown to NY counsel and the client at the MDC, will be 
available for review on a singular laptop at 500 Pearl Street. 
• We also understand the 7 hard-copy highly confidential materials will also be available for inspection at 500 Pearl 
Street. 
Please let me know if you have any questions or disagree with my understanding. If you agree, we can then proceed as 
scheduled on April 12 and continue day to day until we are finished, with a break if necessary for the arraignment.

Subject: RE: US v. Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes 
Counsel, 
Thank you for your email. Below please find our response. If this is acceptable to you, then we will proceed with 
arranging the logistics of having your client produced to 500 Pearl the week of April 12th and the week April 19th. We will 
also arrange for the FBI to transport evidence to 500 Pearl for review the week of April 12th. 
Physical Evidence 
• It is not reasonable or feasible to insist that the FBI bring all physical evidence to 500 Pearl Street. That said, we are 
certainly willing to work with you to ensure that your client can review any physical items that are material to the 
preparation of her defense. 
• We would propose excluding the below items from production to 500 Pearl: 
EFTA00030041
--- PAGE 8 ---
o We appreciate your note that the massage tables are not needed, which will certainly help with the logistics 
of transport. 
o We also appreciate your indication that the cash items from 26 Federal Plaza do not need to be produced. 
Those are the only items not located in the Bronx warehouse. 
o The FBI has seized dozens of electronic devices, including desktop computers, servers, and laptops, from 
Jeffrey Epstein's residences in 2019. Photographs of those devices were produced in our August 2020 
productions as part of the search warrant photographs, and you have received copies of the data that was 
seized from those devices pursuant to a warrant. The production of these devices would be very 
cumbersome, and we do not see any value in looking at an electronic device that cannot be turned on. 
o The framed pictures are bulky and cumbersome to transport. These are also very delicate and are difficult 
to transport. Photographs of those seized images were already provided to you as part of the photographs 
from the searches of Epstein's residences. 
o Certain items seized from the New York residence are bulky, fragile, and/or difficult to transport. These 
include plaster busts of female torsos and a stuffed dog. Photographs of these items were already provided 
to you from the search of the New York residence. 
. The remaining physical items of evidence would fit into approximately 15 to 20 boxes. The FBI has indicated that it 
would be feasible to transport those boxes to 500 Pearl Street. 
• Regarding your request for equipment that can play the recordings, we believe they would require a VCR, a cassette 
player, a CD player, an adapter for a micro VHS tape, and a microcassette player. If you wish to play these 
recordings at 500 Pearl, you will need to provide that equipment. We have asked the FBI whether any other 
equipment would be necessary and will let you know if that is the case prior to the date of your review. It is our 
understanding that any recordings that are not witness statements and that are not highly confidential have been 
produced to you in discovery. We are not aware of any discoverable, non-highly confidential, recordings that were 
not produced to you as part of the Government's discovery productions in the fall. To confirm that understanding, 
we are working with the FBI to physically doublecheck each recording. If we identify any discoverable recordings 
that have not already been produced, we will promptly provide them to you. 
• The segregation of highly confidential material will require the FBI and an AUSA to physically review each item to 
confirm the item's status. We will endeavor to do so by your requested date of April 5, 2021. 
• We can confirm that neither the AUSA(s) nor the agent(s) will record or attempt to record any part of the evidence 
review or conversations among the defense team or with the defendant during this review. Although the evidence 
cannot be left outside of the presence of an agent, we will ensure that a room is available for the defense team and 
the defendant to confer privately away from the agent(s) and the AUSA(s) without monitoring. 
• As for your request for a space large enough to fit 8 members of the defense team, the defendant, an agent, an 
AUSA, and the evidence, my office cannot control the space that the Marshals allow us to use at 500 Pearl outside 
of the proffer rooms. We will certainly request as large a space as possible, but if we are required to use the 
proffer rooms, then members of the defense team may need to rotate in and out of the room. I know members of 
the defense team have been in those proffer rooms before, and they can hopefully provide some thoughts on how 
we might use the proffer room space effectively for your purposes. If the Court grants authorization for the 
defense to bring electronic devices into 500 Pearl, that is certainly fine with the Government, and you may note our 
consent in your request to Judge Nathan for such authorization. 
Highly Confidential Electronic Images 
. The 2,100 electronic images were recovered during the responsiveness review of images and videos seized from 
Jeffrey Epstein's devices, which review was not complete until early November 2020. We indicated on page 4 the 
cover letter to our November 9, 2020 production, which included all other images and videos from those devices, 
that "the Federal Bureau of Investigation ('FBI') seized multiple nude and partially nude images from several for the 
above-listed electronic devices. All such images have been designated Highly Confidential. The FBI will make these 
images available for review by the defense upon request." We did not receive a request from the defense to review 
these images until your March 8, 2021 letter, which requested to "view and inspect all materials designated by your 
office as 'Highly Confidential' under the terms of the Protective Order". 
EFTA00030042
--- PAGE 9 ---
• We did not ask the FBI to bring the 7 hard copy images to the MDC in the fall because we did not understand you to 
be requesting a review of physical, non-electronic evidence during those meetings. Our understanding of the 
defense request at that time was to review the electronic highly confidential images that were recovered from CDs 
from Epstein's residence. We will ensure that the 7 hard copy images are available to you for review at 500 Pearl.

Subject: RE: US v. Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes 
All, 
We have considered your proposal. Unfortunately, it does not permit us an adequate ability to review the evidence in the 
case and does not permit our client to meaningfully participate in her own defense. 
First, we are unable to meaningfully review the evidence without the benefit of our laptops and other electronic devices 
which are needed to take notes of our review. We also need access to our devices during the review to compare the 
physical evidence with the electronic discovery and with our work product. 
Second, we need to provide our client the ability to review all discovery, including any recordings, in order to assist in her 
own defense. Presuming that she will not be taken to the FBI downtown office, then your proposal offers no means by 
which she can both inspect a recording in its physical form and listen to the recording at the same time. 
In order to address the deficiencies in your proposal, we believe the following are necessary: 
Physical Evidence 
• All of the physical evidence currently located in the FBI Bronx warehouse will be transported to 500 Pearl Street 
and made available during the week of April 12, with our client present, in a room sufficiently large to 
accommodate 8 attorneys and investigators. 
o We do not need the "bulky" massage tables transported; if there are any other extremely large evidence 
pieces, let us know what they are and we can consider whether we can have someone review and 
photograph those at the Bronx warehouse at an earlier time. 
o From your email, it appears that only two items are not located at the Bronx warehouse — both envelopes 
with cash. Please confirm this. We do not need the two "cash" evidence items transported to 500 Pearl. 
o If there are other evidence items housed somewhere other than the Bronx, please let us know what they are 
and where they are. 
• We will be permitted to bring our laptops, and a camera, into 500 Pearl Street; we are happy to seek permission 
from Judge Nathan to do so. 
EFTA00030043
--- PAGE 10 ---
• Either the FBI can provide the equipment necessary to listen to any of the recordings at 500 Pearl Street or we can 
bring the necessary equipment. If we are to provide the equipment, we will need to know in advance the formats 
of each recording so that we can be prepared. You can note that on your Excel spreadsheet by the item number by 
March 29 to give us adequate time to secure the necessary equipment. 
• The FBI can segregate any physical evidence that you deem "highly confidential." You can identify any "highly 
confidential" physical evidence items on your Excel spreadsheets by April 5 (one week before the evidence view). If 
we need to photograph or reproduce any such item for expert evaluation, we will seek leave of court. Otherwise, 
we will not photograph any such items during the review during the week of April 12. This will ensure the evidence 
review proceeds smoothly and there will not be any need to ask permission to photograph on an item by item 
basis. 
• The FBI also can segregate any recordings which we will be able to inspect, but not listen to, during the evidence 
view the week of April 12. You can note such designation on your Excel spreadsheet. If we disagree, we can seek 
leave of the Court in advance. 
• We understand that an FBI Agent and/or AUSA may be present during our physical evidence review at 500 Pearl 
Street but of course must ensure that no recordings are made of our conversations and also ensure that there is a 
separate, secure room in which we can confer with our client during the evidence view without monitoring by the 
government. 
• Please confirm whether all electronic recordings (other than the highly-confidential images and videos described 
below) have previously been produced to us, and if not, please explain which ones were not produced by the 
discovery deadlines last fall and why. 
Highly Confidential Electronic Evidence 
• Can you please explain why 2,100 + 7 "highly confidential" images have not been shared with us yet? It was our 
understanding that you previously provided all "highly confidential" images to our client — and to defense counsel —
for review at the MDC in November. We are confused about where these previously undisclosed items were 
located and why they have not yet been made available for inspection and review. 
• During the week of April 19, Ms. Maxwell should be produced to 500 Pearl Street to review (with counsel and a 
defense staff member, on the 1 laptop provided) all of the 5,507 electronic images and video marked "highly 
confidential". These should be segregated into the three categories you describe (never-before produced, 
previously produced, and the 7 hard-copy images). 
Please let us know if you will not agree to any of these steps so that we can address the issues with the Court. 
Thank you.

Subject: RE: US v. Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes 
< 
All, 
Attached please find two spreadsheets documenting all physical evidence in the FBI's custody, as well as a corresponding 
discovery cover letter. We are sending a copy of these files to the MDC for your client as well. 
In response to your questions, the FBI has informed me of the following: 
EFTA00030044
--- PAGE 11 ---
Regarding the Highly Confidential nude/partially nudge images to be reviewed at 500 Pearl: 
• There are three categories of these images: 
o Approximately 2,100 electronic images and videos seized from Epstein's electronic devices (which have not 
been previously provided to you) 
o Approximately 3,400 electronic images from discs seized from Epstein's residences in 2019 (which have 
previously been provided to you and your client for review at the MDC) 
o Approximately 7 hard copy nude images located in the file from the FBI Florida office's investigation of 
Epstein (which have not been previously provided to you) 
• The FBI will make all three of those categories available to you. The electronic files will be provided on hard drives, 
and the FBI will provide you with the hard copy images for review as well. 
o All electronic images should be viewable as thumbnails, except those seized from Apple devices, which must 
be viewed using Cellebrite. 
o The Cellebrite software will be provided on the drive for your review of images and videos seized from Apple 
devices. 
o The electronic files have the same metadata on the hard drive that was available when the FBI seized each 
image. For images that were carved or deleted, no metadata was recovered, so none is viewable. For all 
other images, the metadata recovered should be viewable on the hard drive. 
o The approximately 2,100 electronic images and videos seized from Epstein's devices are separated by folder 
to indicate which device each image was seized from. 
• Because these images are considered obscene material, the FBI is not permitted to make duplicates of them, and 
there is a limited number of clean laptops on which these images can be reviewed. As a result, the FBI is only able 
to provide a single laptop for review of these images. 
Regarding the physical evidence: 
• Attached are two lists of all physical items in the FBI's custody relating to this case. The first list relates to items 
associated with the FBI Florida office's investigation of Epstein. The second list relates to items associated with the 
FBI New York office's current investigation. 
• The vast majority of physical evidence in the FBI's custody is located at the FBI's warehouse in the Bronx. Two 
items (18 77 & 1B 79) are located at 26 Federal Plaza, but the case agents can check those items out from 26 
Federal Plaza and bring them to the Bronx warehouse on whatever day you choose to conduct your review so that 
you will have all evidence in one place. 
• The FBI is able to arrange for the defense team to review all physical evidence at the Bronx warehouse under the 
following conditions: 
o The warehouse requires at least two weeks' notice in order to pull all of the items for the entire case and 
place them in a location where a large group of people can view them. 
o The warehouse is open during normal business hours between 9am and 5pm on weekdays. 
o At least two FBI agents and an AUSA will be present at the Bronx warehouse to assist and answer questions. 
o The evidence will be placed in a loading dock at the warehouse to provide additional space for the review. 
To ensure that there is sufficient space, please let me know how many members of the defense team intend 
to be physically present for this review. 
o Electronic devices such as cellphones and laptops are not permitted in the warehouse. The defense team 
may bring a digital camera that is not connected to the Internet or a cellular network into the warehouse. If 
the defense team wishes to photograph an item of evidence, the defense will need to inform the agents who 
are present, so that they may confirm that the photographed item is not Highly Confidential based on the 
presence of nudity. 
o Electronic media such as VHS tapes, cassette tapes, and CDs will not be playable at the warehouse. 
• To the extent the defense requests that the FBI bring any physical items to 500 Pearl Street for your client to review, 
the FBI is prepared to bring items that are reasonably sized to 500 Pearl Street. With respect to bulky or large 
items, the defense team should be able to photograph those for your client to review, unless they are deemed 
Highly Confidential, in which case the FBI can make arrangements to transport the item to 500 Pearl Street if 
necessary. 
• The FBI is in the process of confirming that it can provide devices to play all of the electronic media in the case in a 
single location at the FBI's offices in downtown Manhattan. We are also double-checking to confirm that all media 
EFTA00030045
--- PAGE 12 ---
that does not contain witness statements have already been produced to you and your client in discovery. The FBI 
anticipates that we can arrange for you to review all non-witness statement electronic media at the FBI's office in 
downtown Manhattan in approximately three weeks. 
o To the extent you wish to review all of the discs containing photographs, which were seized from Epstein's 
residences in 2019, we note that all of those images have already been produced to you in discovery. For 
your awareness, the FBI has informed me that it took their team several weeks to review all of the images on 
all of those discs. 
Please let me know how you wish to proceed.

Now that the FBI team is back, when do you expect to have answers to all of the questions posed? If I had an idea of 
when you would have answers, it could help me answer your question. 
At a minimum, it would not seem to take too much time to know when someone can open the FBI vault and allow the 
attorneys to make an initial view of the evidence. Also, I understand the FBI did not prepare an inventory of their 
evidence when they seized it from NY and LSJ, so I don't think we need to wait for them to now prepare an inventory 
before we start reviewing evidence. 
Also, when do you believe you will have a response regarding the discovery I requested last Monday? 
Thanks, 
Laura

Counsel, 
The FBI team on this case has been out of the office this week and will not be able to answer all of the questions you 
asked during our Wednesday call until they are back in the office next week. Please let me know if you would like to wait 
until all of those questions can be answered to schedule a day for your client to be brought to 500 Pearl Street to review 
the highly confidential images. My understanding is that the FBI is able to provide at least one laptop containing those 
highly confidential images in time for such a review to take place on Thursday 5/18, but I may not have the answers to all 
of your questions about those images before that date, and I do not know whether you will also be able to visit the 
evidence vault that same week. 
Please let me know how you would like to proceed. I will reach back out once I have answers to your questions. 
Thank you,

That is the only excel spreadsheet indexing physical evidence that we have produced in discovery. That spreadsheet does 
not include every physical item currently in the FBI's custody related to this case. For example, the August 20, 2020 
discovery production also included search warrant returns listing the physical items seized by the FBI's New York Office 
during the 2019 searches of Jeffrey Epstein's residences in New York and the U.S Virgin Islands (see Bates range 
SDNY_GM_00166007-SDNY_GM_00166043), but they are not contained in a spreadsheet. 
As a courtesy, I have asked the FBI whether it would be possible to provide us with a similar excel index reflecting the 
physical evidence seized by the FBI's New York Office, though it may take some time to compile such an index.

Counsel, 
In advance of our call tomorrow, I wanted to send a copy of the attached index of physical items in FBI custody from the 
FBI-Miami office, which we previously produced to you as part of our August 21, 2020 discovery production. Also 
included in that August 21, 2020 production were scans of numerous items listed on the index. Those scans can be found 
within Bates range SDNY_GM_00172218-SDNY_GM_00173007. It may be useful to reference some of those items during 
our conversation tomorrow, so I wanted to make sure you were aware of them.

Case name: United States v. Turkiye Hall( Bankasi AS, a/k/a "Halkbank" 
Docket number: S6 15 Cr. 867 (RMB) 
Brief description of the charges/claims: In October 2019, USAO-SDNY charged Halkbank with fraud, money laundering, 
and sanctions offenses related to the bank's participation in a multibillion-dollar scheme to evade U.S. sanctions on 
Iran. As set forth in the indictment, an investigation by USAO-SDNY and the FBI revealed that Halkbank and its officers, 
agents, and co-conspirators directly and indirectly used money service businesses and front companies in Iran, Turkey, 
the United Arab Emirates, and elsewhere to violate and to evade and avoid prohibitions against Iran's access to the U.S. 
financial system, restrictions on the use of proceeds of Iranian oil and gas sales, and restrictions on the supply of gold to 
the Government of Iran and to Iranian entities and persons. Halkbank knowingly facilitated the scheme, participated in 
the design of fraudulent transactions intended to deceive U.S. regulators and foreign banks, and lied to U.S. regulators 
about Halkbank's involvement. USAO-SDNY previously tried and convicted Halkbank's former Deputy General Manager 
of International Banking at Halkbank for his participation in the scheme. 
Current case status: Trial is scheduled for May 2021. On December 23, 2020, the Second Circuit stayed proceedings in 
the district court pending expedited resolution of Halkbank's mandamus petition challenging the district court's denial 
of a motion to dismiss pursuant to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.

Case name: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell 
Docket number: 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
Brief description of the charges/claims: In July 2020, USAO-SDNY charged Maxwell in a six-count indictment with 
facilitating the sexual abuse of three minor victims by Jeffrey Epstein between approximately 1994 and 1997. The 
charges resulted from a multi-year investigation by the USAO-SDNY and the FBI into Jeffrey Epstein and his co-
conspirators, including Maxwell. Maxwell played a critical role in the scheme by helping to identify, entice, and groom 
EFTA00030054
--- PAGE 3 ---
minor girls to engage in sex acts with Epstein. Her presence as an adult woman normalized Epstein's abusive behavior, 
and she took part in at least some acts of sexual abuse. Maxwell and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel 
to Epstein's residences in different states, which Maxwell knew and intended would result in their grooming for and 
subjection to sexual abuse, resulting in charges related to the enticement and transportation of minors to participate in 
illegal sex acts, and conspiracy to do the same, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2422, 2423, and 371. In a later effort to cover 
up her crimes, Maxwell lied under oath during a civil deposition, including when asked about her interactions with 
minor girls, resulting in two perjury charges, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1623. 
Current case status: Maxwell has been detained since her arrest, and the Court has denied two separate bail motions, 
most recently as of December 28, 2020. Trial is scheduled for July 2021, and pretrial motions are due in January 2021.

Subject: RE: Disparities in Counsel and Discovery Access for Ghislaine Maxwell and Justin Rivera 
: We are in the process of finalizing our response to the Maxwell/Rivera issue. We intend to 
explain that the discovery and counsel access accommodations that have been provided to Maxwell 
and Rivera, respectively, result from the specific circumstances of their cases, the specific requests of 
their lawyers, and their individual housing circumstances. On all of these factors, there are several 
important differences, including: 
- 
The Maxwell case has multiple times more discovery than the Rivera case. Hence, the need 
for such expanded discovery access is greater in the Maxwell case. 
At the MDC, Maxwell has a unique housing situation, as she is in protective custody outside 
the general population. She therefore has sole access to a room to use a computer and phone 
for approximately 13 hours a day. Rivera, by contrast, is housed in the general population. 
There are approximately 8o other inmates at the MCC in Rivera's unit that use the same VTC 
room for court appearances, probation interviews, and attorney meetings. By contrast, 
Maxwell shares access to the MDC VTC room with substantially fewer inmates. The MDC can 
therefore provide 15 hours of VTC meetings with her attorneys without compromising access 
for other MDC inmates. The same is not true for Rivera at the MCC. 
Going forward, even though Rivera's counsel have asked (and the Court has ordered) that Rivera 
receive three hours of laptop access each day, the MCC is now leaving the laptop with him all day 
long, and only takes it back at night to charge it. Therefore, the MCC is now providing the same 
amount of electronic discovery access to Rivera that Maxwell receives at the MDC. 
As for providing Rivera with up to 15 hours of VTC access, we will explain that doing so will 
compromise access for other inmates. If defense counsel expresses a need for additional time, the 
MCC will continue to find ways to accommodate those requests as best as they can. 
Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss this further. 
Best,

between MCC and MDC, as well as specific differences in their housing situations?

Subject: Disparities in Counsel and Discovery Access for Ghislaine Maxwell and Justin Rivera 
All: 
I wanted to bring to your attention a recent issue that's surfaced in United States v. Rivera et al., a 
sex trafficking case pending before Judge Engelmayer. As I'll describe in more detail below, Judge 
Engelmayer has asked us to submit a declaration from the BOP explaining why the discovery and 
counsel access accommodations provided to Ghislaine Maxwell (detained at the MDC outside the 
general population) cannot be extended to Justin Rivera (detained at the MCC in the general 
population). 
Justin Rivera was charged in February 2019 with sex trafficking conspiracy. He's been detained at 
the MCC since April 2019 on consent (he's also serving a state sentence). His trial, which was 
originally scheduled for April 2019, is expected to start on February 16, 2020. In July 2020, he had 
new counsel appointed, citing an irreconcilable breakdown with his former counsel. 
Since this fall, Judge Engelmayer has become increasingly frustrated with the MCC's treatment of 
Rivera. In particular, he's cited their failure to provide Rivera with adequate accommodations to 
review discovery and meet with his lawyers, who refuse to visit Rivera at the MCC for personal health 
concerns. We have two court orders in place to address these issues: (0 a laptop order, which 
requires the MCC to provide Rivera access to a laptop for three hours per day; and (2) a 
videoconference order, which requires the MCC to make available four hours of videoconferencing 
each week, in addition to any telephone or videoconference calls obtained through the Federal 
Defenders. 
At the moment, there's not a concern, at least from Judge Engelmayer, that the amount of time 
Rivera has for videoconferences and electronic discovery review is insufficient for trial preparation, 
although defense counsel has stated that they may request more time in the future. However, in a 
letter last night and during a court conference this morning (transcript attached), defense counsel 
cited the accommodations that the MDC has provided to Maxwell, describing them as "strikingly 
different and far superior" to those afforded to Rivera. Defense counsel further suggested that Rivera 
was being treated differently on account of his race, gender and class. Judge Engelmayer stated that 
the disparity in access "jumped off the page" and that the optics were "terrible," and asked us to 
e lain the rationale for the differing treatment. After conferring with 
and 
before our conference, we explained our understanding that the disparity comes down to 
the fact that Maxwell and Rivera have very different housing situations, with Maxwell's situation 
being more amenable to greater access to electronic discovery review and legal visits. 
Judge Engelmayer asked us to submit a declaration, from an appropriate person at the BOP, 
explaining in more detail why the accommodations provided to Maxwell cannot be extended to 
Rivera. Based on the recent bail opposition in the Maxwell case, I believe the differences in 
counsel/discovery access are as follows:

Hi 
Please see our proposed letter, which I understand you would like to review, as well as 
declarations from associate wardens at the MDC and MCC. The GC and PC chiefs have signed off on 
these drafts. 
With apologies for the time sensitivity, our contacts at MCC/MDC have asked to leave early today 
(before 1/1:30), and have asked us to finalize the declarations as soon as possible.

Subject: RE: Disparities in Counsel and Discovery Access for Ghislaine Maxwell and Justin Rivera 
: We are in the process of finalizing our response to the Maxwell/Rivera issue. We intend to 
explain that the discovery and counsel access accommodations that have been provided to Maxwell 
and Rivera, respectively, result from the specific circumstances of their cases, the specific requests of 
their lawyers, and their individual housing circumstances. On all of these factors, there are several 
important differences, including: 
- 
The Maxwell case has multiple times more discovery than the Rivera case. Hence, the need 
for such expanded discovery access is greater in the Maxwell case. 
At the MDC, Maxwell has a unique housing situation, as she is in protective custody outside 
the general population. She therefore has sole access to a room to use a computer and phone 
for approximately 13 hours a day. Rivera, by contrast, is housed in the general population. 
There are approximately 8o other inmates at the MCC in Rivera's unit that use the same VTC 
room for court appearances, probation interviews, and attorney meetings. By contrast, 
Maxwell shares access to the MDC VTC room with substantially fewer inmates. The MDC can 
therefore provide 15 hours of VTC meetings with her attorneys without compromising access 
for other MDC inmates. The same is not true for Rivera at the MCC. 
Going forward, even though Rivera's counsel have asked (and the Court has ordered) that Rivera 
receive three hours of laptop access each day, the MCC is now leaving the laptop with him all day 
long, and only takes it back at night to charge it. Therefore, the MCC is now providing the same 
amount of electronic discovery access to Rivera that Maxwell receives at the MDC. 
As for providing Rivera with up to 15 hours of VTC access, we will explain that doing so will 
compromise access for other inmates. If defense counsel expresses a need for additional time, the 
MCC will continue to find ways to accommodate those requests as best as they can. 
Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss this further. 
Best,

Thanks, 
. Can you keep me posted on what we think will be the substance of the draft declaration when you 
know (that is, before we are submitting anything on 12/31)? And how much of this is attributable to differences 
between MCC and MDC, as well as specific differences in their housing situations?

Subject: Disparities in Counsel and Discovery Access for Ghislaine Maxwell and Justin Rivera 
All: 
I wanted to bring to your attention a recent issue that's surfaced in United States v. Rivera et al., a 
sex trafficking case pending before Judge Engelmayer. As I'll describe in more detail below, Judge 
Engelmayer has asked us to submit a declaration from the BOP explaining why the discovery and 
counsel access accommodations provided to Ghislaine Maxwell (detained at the MDC outside the 
general population) cannot be extended to Justin Rivera (detained at the MCC in the general 
population). 
Justin Rivera was charged in February 2019 with sex trafficking conspiracy. He's been detained at 
the MCC since April 2019 on consent (he's also serving a state sentence). His trial, which was 
originally scheduled for April 2019, is expected to start on February 16, 2020. In July 2020, he had 
new counsel appointed, citing an irreconcilable breakdown with his former counsel. 
Since this fall, Judge Engelmayer has become increasingly frustrated with the MCC's treatment of 
Rivera. In particular, he's cited their failure to provide Rivera with adequate accommodations to 
review discovery and meet with his lawyers, who refuse to visit Rivera at the MCC for personal health 
concerns. We have two court orders in place to address these issues: (0 a laptop order, which 
requires the MCC to provide Rivera access to a laptop for three hours per day; and (2) a 
videoconference order, which requires the MCC to make available four hours of videoconferencing 
each week, in addition to any telephone or videoconference calls obtained through the Federal 
Defenders. 
At the moment, there's not a concern, at least from Judge Engelmayer, that the amount of time 
Rivera has for videoconferences and electronic discovery review is insufficient for trial preparation, 
although defense counsel has stated that they may request more time in the future. However, in a 
letter last night and during a court conference this morning (transcript attached), defense counsel 
cited the accommodations that the MDC has provided to Maxwell, describing them as "strikingly 
different and far superior" to those afforded to Rivera. Defense counsel further suggested that Rivera 
was being treated differently on account of his race, gender and class. Judge Engelmayer stated that 
the disparity in access "jumped off the page" and that the optics were "terrible," and asked us to 
e lain the rationale for the differing treatment. After conferring with 
and 
before our conference, we explained our understanding that the disparity comes down to 
the fact that Maxwell and Rivera have very different housing situations, with Maxwell's situation 
being more amenable to greater access to electronic discovery review and legal visits. 
Judge Engelmayer asked us to submit a declaration, from an appropriate person at the BOP, 
explaining in more detail why the accommodations provided to Maxwell cannot be extended to 
Rivera. Based on the recent bail opposition in the Maxwell case, I believe the differences in 
counsel/discovery access are as follows:

Subject: Gail Collins on Epstein, Acosta and "everything that happens in this country winds up in the hands 
of New York prosecutors" 
Date: Fri, 18 Oct 2019 19:56:38 +0000 
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/10/opinion/acosta-epstein.html?searchResultPosition=17 
Trump Doesn't Know About Labor 
Thank God we've got so many inept cabinet members. 
By Gail Collins 
July 10, 2019 
So, did you enjoy the parade for the U.S. women's soccer team? People sure did seem happy. I believe this is partly 
because the players are terrific and partly because many Americans are desperate to think about something other than 
Donald Trump. 
And, good Lord, his crack team of cabinet members. On Wednesday, Secretary of Labor Alex Acosta tried to hold back the 
outrage that's been building since people learned that, as a federal prosecutor in South Florida, he had brokered a very 
lenient punishment for Jeffrey Epstein, a rich guy who liked to have sex with underage girls. 
Explanation: It was a good deal. You know how this administration feels about good deals. 
"The Palm Beach state attorney's office was ready to let Epstein walk free," Acosta said in his calm, sort of toneless voice. 
"Our prosecutors ... presented the ultimatum." Which was that Epstein, who had molested a parade of teenagers, some 
only 14, had to serve at least a little jail time. The punishment Acosta wrangled with his alleged best possible efforts 
involved 13 months in prison, during which Epstein was free to spend most days at his office as long as he slept overnight 
in the clink. 
The victims had no idea that might be the end of the story. The case is now in the hands of federal prosecutors in New 
York who are going after Epstein on other sex-trafficking charges. (You may have noticed that over the last few years 
virtually everything that happens in this country winds up in the hands of New York prosecutors.) 
Do you think Acosta ever asked himself whether he could have fought harder? Nah. The problem was the victims, who 
were too "scared and traumatized" to be good witnesses. Asked by reporters if he had any regrets, he just said that was "a 
very hard question." 
Have you heard anybody in the Trump administration apologize for anything? Well, there was the occasion the secretary 
of health and human services said he was sorry he spent $400,000 of our tax dollars to fly around in specially chartered 
planes. But that was a long time and a whole lot of bad behavior ago. 
About Jeffrey Epstein. He sounds like one of the worst people imaginable, so we are, of course, stunned to hear he used 
to be tight with our current chief executive. "Terrific guy;' Trump said in an interview with New York magazine in 2002. 
"He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the 
younger side." 
The palship no longer exists. "I had a falling-out with him. I haven't spoken to him in 15 years. I was not a fan of his, that I 
can tell you," said the president, who appears to have erased the lot-of-fun-to-be-with period. 
EFTA00030071
--- PAGE 2 ---
Are you shocked by any of this? Hey, early in our acquaintanceship we learned Trump is a guy who bragged about being so 
important he could get away with grabbing women by their private parts. Who was put into office thanks to Russian 
manipulation of our election. Some days you just want to sigh and talk a lot about women's soccer. 
Ever since the Epstein scandal arose, Trump has been defending Acosta, stressing what an "excellent" job he's doing. After 
all, the president told reporters, "our economy is so good, our unemployment numbers are at record lows." You might 
have thought he was under the impression the secretary of labor had something to do with boosting the economy. As 
opposed to things like workplace safety and collecting job statistics. 
And oh, yeah, human trafficking. Very embarrassing that Acosta is one of the people who's supposed to protect underage 
women from being sold as sex slaves. 
Hmm. Before this week, what do you think Donald Trump thought the Department of Labor did? 
A) Something about delivering babies. 
B) Something about getting good people to, you know, mow the lawn and stuff. 
C) Something. 
The president is oblivious, but otherwise almost nobody likes the job Acosta's been doing. People who care about workers 
are naturally outraged that he's been trying to water down everything from mine safety regulations to the rules that 
prohibit restaurant managers from grabbing a piece of the waiters' tips. 
Trump insiders, of course, feel undermining workers' rights is supposed to be Acosta's mission. And they complain he's 
been sort of inept at it. Mick Mulvaney, the Trump Acting Chief of Staff For Life, has been trying to take control. Recently, 
Acosta's chief of staff was pushed out for a lack of, um, leadership. Or, as one former administration official told Politico, 
"There are times when he goes completely loony." 
You've got to be appalled by Acosta's failure to stand up for vulnerable children being lured into serving as sex playthings 
for a man who truly does epitomize the concept of filthy rich. 
But are you upset that Trump is too much of an ethical beanbag to get rid of him? The sad truth is that we're really 
probably better off with cabinet members too inept to accomplish anything at all. 
Cheer up. There's always soccer.

Hi= 
Hope you're doing well. 
and =and I are trying to assemble a list of ever FOIA request our office has ever 
received (at any point) relating to Jeffrey Epstein and/or Ghislaine Maxwell. 
.uggested that you'd be the 
best point of contact to help us figure this out. Could you please send us the following information: 
• A list of all FOIA requests our office has received; 
• For each case, whether a production was made in response to the request; and 
• Who the AUSA point of contact for the request is. 
That would be a big help. Please let us know if you need any information from us to run the search.

Now that the FBI team is back, when do you expect to have answers to all of the questions posed? If I had an idea of 
when you would have answers, it could help me answer your question. 
At a minimum, it would not seem to take too much time to know when someone can open the FBI vault and allow the 
attorneys to make an initial view of the evidence. Also, I understand the FBI did not prepare an inventory of their 
evidence when they seized it from NY and LSJ, so I don't think we need to wait for them to now prepare an inventory 
before we start reviewing evidence. 
Also, when do you believe you will have a response regarding the discovery I requested last Monday?

Counsel, 
The FBI team on this case has been out of the office this week and will not be able to answer all of the questions you 
asked during our Wednesday call until they are back in the office next week. Please let me know if you would like to wait 
until all of those questions can be answered to schedule a day for your client to be brought to 500 Pearl Street to review 
the highly confidential images. My understanding is that the FBI is able to provide at least one laptop containing those 
highly confidential images in time for such a review to take place on Thursday 5/18, but I may not have the answers to all 
of your questions about those images before that date, and I do not know whether you will also be able to visit the 
evidence vault that same week. 
Please let me know how you would like to proceed. I will reach back out once I have answers to your questions. 
Thank you,

That is the only excel spreadsheet indexing physical evidence that we have produced in discovery. That spreadsheet does 
not include every physical item currently in the FBI's custody related to this case. For example, the August 20, 2020 
EFTA00030085
--- PAGE 3 ---
discovery production also included search warrant returns listing the physical items seized by the FBI's New York Office 
during the 2019 searches of Jeffrey Epstein's residences in New York and the U.S Virgin Islands (see Bates range 
SDNY_GM_00166007-SDNY_GM_00166043), but they are not contained in a spreadsheet. 
As a courtesy, I have asked the FBI whether it would be possible to provide us with a similar excel index reflecting the 
physical evidence seized by the FBI's New York Office, though it may take some time to compile such an index.

Counsel, 
In advance of our call tomorrow, I wanted to send a copy of the attached index of physical items in FBI custody from the 
FBI-Miami office, which we previously produced to you as part of our August 21, 2020 discovery production. Also 
included in that August 21, 2020 production were scans of numerous items listed on the index. Those scans can be found 
within Bates range SDNY_GM_00172218-SDNY_GM_00173007. It may be useful to reference some of those items during 
our conversation tomorrow, so I wanted to make sure you were aware of them.

All, 
Attached please find two spreadsheets documenting all physical evidence in the FBI's custody, as well as a corresponding 
discovery cover letter. We are sending a copy of these files to the MDC for your client as well. 
In response to your questions, the FBI has informed me of the following: 
Regarding the Highly Confidential nude/partially nudge images to be reviewed at 500 Pearl: 
• There are three categories of these images: 
o Approximately 2,100 electronic images and videos seized from Epstein's electronic devices (which have not 
been previously provided to you) 
o Approximately 3,400 electronic images from discs seized from Epstein's residences in 2019 (which have 
previously been provided to you and your client for review at the MDC) 
o Approximately 7 hard copy nude images located in the file from the FBI Florida office's investigation of 
Epstein (which have not been previously provided to you) 
• The FBI will make all three of those categories available to you. The electronic files will be provided on hard drives, 
and the FBI will provide you with the hard copy images for review as well. 
o All electronic images should be viewable as thumbnails, except those seized from Apple devices, which must 
be viewed using Cellebrite. 
o The Cellebrite software will be provided on the drive for your review of images and videos seized from Apple 
devices. 
o The electronic files have the same metadata on the hard drive that was available when the FBI seized each 
image. For images that were carved or deleted, no metadata was recovered, so none is viewable. For all 
other images, the metadata recovered should be viewable on the hard drive. 
o The approximately 2,100 electronic images and videos seized from Epstein's devices are separated by folder 
to indicate which device each image was seized from. 
• Because these images are considered obscene material, the FBI is not permitted to make duplicates of them, and 
there is a limited number of clean laptops on which these images can be reviewed. As a result, the FBI is only able 
to provide a single laptop for review of these images. 
Regarding the physical evidence: 
• Attached are two lists of all physical items in the FBI's custody relating to this case. The first list relates to items 
associated with the FBI Florida office's investigation of Epstein. The second list relates to items associated with the 
FBI New York office's current investigation. 
• The vast majority of physical evidence in the FBI's custody is located at the FBI's warehouse in the Bronx. Two 
items (18 77 & 1B 79) are located at 26 Federal Plaza, but the case agents can check those items out from 26 
EFTA00030101
--- PAGE 2 ---
Federal Plaza and bring them to the Bronx warehouse on whatever day you choose to conduct your review so that 
you will have all evidence in one place. 
• The FBI is able to arrange for the defense team to review all physical evidence at the Bronx warehouse under the 
following conditions: 
o The warehouse requires at least two weeks' notice in order to pull all of the items for the entire case and 
place them in a location where a large group of people can view them. 
o The warehouse is open during normal business hours between 9am and 5pm on weekdays. 
o At least two FBI agents and an AUSA will be present at the Bronx warehouse to assist and answer questions. 
o The evidence will be placed in a loading dock at the warehouse to provide additional space for the review. 
To ensure that there is sufficient space, please let me know how many members of the defense team intend 
to be physically present for this review. 
o Electronic devices such as cellphones and laptops are not permitted in the warehouse. The defense team 
may bring a digital camera that is not connected to the Internet or a cellular network into the warehouse. If 
the defense team wishes to photograph an item of evidence, the defense will need to inform the agents who 
are present, so that they may confirm that the photographed item is not Highly Confidential based on the 
presence of nudity. 
o Electronic media such as VHS tapes, cassette tapes, and CDs will not be playable at the warehouse. 
• To the extent the defense requests that the FBI bring any physical items to 500 Pearl Street for your client to review, 
the FBI is prepared to bring items that are reasonably sized to 500 Pearl Street. With respect to bulky or large 
items, the defense team should be able to photograph those for your client to review, unless they are deemed 
Highly Confidential, in which case the FBI can make arrangements to transport the item to 500 Pearl Street if 
necessary. 
• The FBI is in the process of confirming that it can provide devices to play all of the electronic media in the case in a 
single location at the FBI's offices in downtown Manhattan. We are also double-checking to confirm that all media 
that does not contain witness statements have already been produced to you and your client in discovery. The FBI 
anticipates that we can arrange for you to review all non-witness statement electronic media at the FBI's office in 
downtown Manhattan in approximately three weeks. 
o To the extent you wish to review all of the discs containing photographs, which were seized from Epstein's 
residences in 2019, we note that all of those images have already been produced to you in discovery. For 
your awareness, the FBI has informed me that it took their team several weeks to review all of the images on 
all of those discs. 
Please let me know how you wish to proceed.

Now that the FBI team is back, when do you expect to have answers to all of the questions posed? If I had an idea of 
when you would have answers, it could help me answer your question. 
At a minimum, it would not seem to take too much time to know when someone can open the FBI vault and allow the 
attorneys to make an initial view of the evidence. Also, I understand the FBI did not prepare an inventory of their 
evidence when they seized it from NY and LSJ, so I don't think we need to wait for them to now prepare an inventory 
before we start reviewing evidence. 
Also, when do you believe you will have a response regarding the discovery I requested last Monday? 
Thanks, 
Laura

Counsel, 
The FBI team on this case has been out of the office this week and will not be able to answer all of the questions you 
asked during our Wednesday call until they are back in the office next week. Please let me know if you would like to wait 
until all of those questions can be answered to schedule a day for your client to be brought to 500 Pearl Street to review 
the highly confidential images. My understanding is that the FBI is able to provide at least one laptop containing those 
highly confidential images in time for such a review to take place on Thursday 5/18, but I may not have the answers to all 
of your questions about those images before that date, and I do not know whether you will also be able to visit the 
evidence vault that same week. 
Please let me know how you would like to proceed. I will reach back out once I have answers to your questions. 
Thank you,

That is the only excel spreadsheet indexing physical evidence that we have produced in discovery. That spreadsheet does 
not include every physical item currently in the FBI's custody related to this case. For example, the August 20, 2020 
discovery production also included search warrant returns listing the physical items seized by the FBI's New York Office 
during the 2019 searches of Jeffrey Epstein's residences in New York and the U.S Virgin Islands (see Bates range 
SDNY_GM_00166007-SDNY_GM_00166043), but they are not contained in a spreadsheet. 
As a courtesy, I have asked the FBI whether it would be possible to provide us with a similar excel index reflecting the 
physical evidence seized by the FBI's New York Office, though it may take some time to compile such an index.

Counsel, 
In advance of our call tomorrow, I wanted to send a copy of the attached index of physical items in FBI custody from the 
FBI-Miami office, which we previously produced to you as part of our August 21, 2020 discovery production. Also 
included in that August 21, 2020 production were scans of numerous items listed on the index. Those scans can be found 
within Bates range SDNY_GM_00172218-SDNY_GM_00173007. It may be useful to reference some of those items during 
our conversation tomorrow, so I wanted to make sure you were aware of them.

As discussed, attached are the title transfer documents we have for Epstein's New York, Palm Beach, and Virgin Islands 
residences. I've also included the articles of incorporation for four of the relevant entities referenced in the transfer 
documents. It appears that we obtained at least some of these documents pursuant to grand jury subpoenas. Let me 
know if you need us to distinguish between the documents that we found through without a subpoena and those we 
obtained via subpoena. 
We do not have documents for the New Mexico property, as far as I can tell, but I'll chat with the team about tracking 
those down. Please let us know if there are any other materials you need us to find as well.

Andy, 
Three issues: 
I. We plan to produce the redacted notes to the defense pursuant to the protective order, and the name on an AEO 
basis to defense counsel. Your letter states that both will be provided on an AEO, which misstates our intention. 
2. When we discussed this, we understood that this would not be submitted to defense counsel prior to Judge 
Torres ruling on your request. There is no language in the letter to that effect, and it seems appropriate to add it. 
3. Please add "to the defense" in the first letter to make clear to the Court that you are intervening in our 
production of discovery to defense counsel in this matter (and not, for instance, in a disclosure to the public or 
any other entity). 
Thanks.

Andy, 
We cannot agree to these redactions, and think it would be appropriate for you to file a motion before Judge Torres, under 
seal and copying the Government (but ex parte as to the defense). Could you please send us a copy of the letter before 
you file it, so that we can ensure that our position is accurately represented? Thanks very much.

We have attached a proposed disclosure cover letter that is modeled on a letter sent by the Government in United States v. 
Madonna, 17 Cr. 89 (CS). We have also attached proposed redacted disclosures. As you and I discussed, we offer this as 
a means to ensure our client's safety while permitting the Government to comply with what you believe are your 
disclosure obligations. 
As an alternative, we are willing to apply under seal to Judge Torres for a Protective Order to preclude the disclosure. 
Our client is not a witness, and so this is not 3500 material, nor is it Rule 16 material. We do not believe that this is in 
fact Brady material, but rather is an error made by our client that we understand is contradicted by the surveillance video 
evidence. While we applaud your efforts, we have an obligation to make sure that our client is not harmed by the 
possible release of the fact that he met with your Office. 
We understand that you have time constraints. Please let us know how you want to proceed so that we can file a motion 
before Judge Torres promptly if that is necessary.

Andy, 
Attached are unredacted and redacted copies of the notes. As discussed, we intend to produce redacted copies of the 
notes pursuant to the protective order, and produce Mr. 
name and your contact information to defense counsel 
on an AEO basis. The file name will be changed to the bates number so it will not include his name. 
I'm also copying my co-counse 
please include them on emails going forward. Finally, Justina is aware

Thanks, and please feel free to give us a call to discuss.

Alex, 
That makes sense, thanks. Our team is available to do Friday at 11:00, and we can host here at our offices, 
if that still works for you both (and Jenna if she's able to join). On our end I expect it will be prosecutors 
and me, and FBI Special Agent 
Separately, as promised, attached is our form proffer agreement—when we meet with your client we'll add her name and 
counsel information (and also change all the he / him to she/ her, obviously). Please let me know if any questions on that. 
Thanks again, and looking forward to meeting in person on Friday.

Hi, 
Thanks so much for your email. Fully agree -- Jenna is the best. This is for an attorney proffer and if possible, Jenna will 
probably join us. 
I'm not sure whether 
legally changed her name, or if I was just given her husband's last name 
her about it tonight. Also happy to ask her about phone numbers for anyone associated with Epstein.

That's great, thanks — and 
is fantastic, happy to have her involved. Just to clarify, and to help with our scheduling, I 
take it we'll start with an attorney proffer? Or let me know if I misinterpreted and we're talking about a meeting with the 
client. Either one totally fine but wanted to confirm— let me know and I'll circle back in timing, and will also send you a 
copy of our standard proffer agreement so you have it for your meeting with her this afternoon. 
Two other quick things — first, we know your client as 
but I think you mentioned her name has changed? 
Could you please let me know her current last name? 
And second, one very helpful thing for us would be to have any phone numbers she utilized with Epstein or anyone 
associated with him at that time, and/or numbers for him or others she communicated with in connection with him. 
Primarily, that could help to corroborate and confirm her recollections, and it's something we don't need to talk to her 
directly about to get started working on. If you think it would concern her to provide that at this stage, no problem at all, 
we can circle back to it later, but wanted to mention it. 
thanks,

Dershowitz Can Pursue Bid To DQ Boies Schiller In 
Sex Case 
By Andrew Strickler 
Share us on: By Andrew Strickler 
Law360 (June 18, 2019, 6:13 PM EDT) -- The New York federal judge who initially refused to hear Alan Dershowitz's 
request to disqualify Boies Schiller Flexner LLP from representing a woman accusing the prominent attorney and retired 
Harvard Law School professor of sexually molesting her said on Monday that she would consider it. 
In a brief order, U.S. District Judge Loretta A. Preska allowed Dershowitz's motion to be reinstated and said he could file a 
28-page memo on his request. 
The order comes a week after Judge Preska said she was removing the motion because Dershowitz didn't request a 
premotion conference before the filing in violation of a court rule. 
Dershowitz's accuser 
has alleged that convicted billionaire sex offender Jeffrey Epstein "lent her out for 
sex" to Dershowitz and that Dershowitz played a role as Epstein's attorney and friend in a human trafficking  scheme 
during the late 1990s and early 2000s involving dozens of underage girls. 
In a July 7 motion, Dershowitz argued that Boies Schiller shouldn't be allowed to continue to represent necause 
the firm has "severe" conflicts in the case. 
Those stem from an offer made in 2015 by Boies Schiller partner Carlos Sires to represent Dershowitz after Giuffre alleged 
EFTA00030155
--- PAGE 2 ---
in a separate Crime Victims Rights Act suit focused on Epstein's deal with prosecutors that she had sex with Dershowitz 
and others. 
Dershowitz said in his motion he didn't learn Boies Schiller was representing his accuser in the current case until after he 
shared with Sires a "highly confidential" memo spelling out his legal strategy in the case. The next day, Sires informed 
Dershowitz that a client conflict was going to prevent him from representing Dershowitz. 
Last week, Boies Schiller submitted a letter to the court stating that Dershowitz hadn't complied with the premotion 
conference rule; Judge Preska agreed and ordered his filing "marked off the calendar." 
"Professor Dershowitz is gratified that the court will consider the motion on its merits," said Dershowitz counsel Arthur L. 
Aidala and Imran H. Ansari in a statement Tuesday. 
Giuffre counsel Joshua Schiller of Boies Schiller submitted a letter to Judge Preska on Monday urging her to deny the 
disqualification request without further briefing. 
Dershowitz filed the "tactical" motion months into the suit despite having known for some five years that the firm 
represents =Schiller said. Moreover, Dershowitz's brief contact with Sires never resulted in the formation of an 
attorney-client relationship. 
"Even though he knew that BSF's conflict check had not been completed, Dershowitz copied Mr. Sires into a group e-mail 
attaching a memorandum, which Dershowitz now claims was confidential," Schiller wrote, adding that the memo was 
addressed to Dershowitz's "friends" and contained no confidential information. 
"This is an attempt to manufacture a conflict and delay the case and prevent our client from working with the counsel 
she's worked with for five years," Schiller told Law360. 
Dershowitz's ties to the Epstein scandal were back in the news after a February ruling by U.S. District Judge Kenneth A. 
Marra, who found current Labor Secretary Alex Acosta had been among several prosecutors who mishandled a decade-
old sex crime case against Epstein when they signed a nonprosecution agreement with Epstein without notifying his 
victims. 
Giuffre is represented by Joshua Schiller and Sigrid McCawley of Boies Schiller Flexner LLP. 
Dershowitz is represented by Imran H. Ansari and Arthur L. Aidala of Aidala Bertuna & Kamins PC. 
The case is,. 
Dershowitz, case number 1:19-cv-03377 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New 
York.

The discovery of the photographs will not have any effect on, nor will it alter, the status of his sex offender 
registration. We have conferred with the NYS Division of Criminal Justice Services (DCJS) in Albany in order to 
obtain his case file which would include the risk assessment. They are in the middle of a multi-year project to 
digitally scan all of their dots and the Epstein file is with the vendor. We should have it within 10 days.

Lt. M, 
Thanks very much for being in touch, and I'm in receipt of your email — should Mr. Epstein be granted bail and released, I 
will certainly advise his attorneys that he or they must contact you immediately to arrange for the processes required in 
New York State. I'm also copying my colleagues on the case, prosecutors 
and S 
so they're 
aware of the issue as well. 
Separately, at the bail hearing yesterday the judge asked if there is any effect from the discovery of nude and partially-
nude photographs of women and girls who appear to be young, including possibly under 18 years of age, discovered 
during a search on Saturday in his New York residence. Do you know if there is any impact of that with respect to his 
New York registration and/or offender status? Or if there's another person I should check with about that? I'm happy to 
give anyone a call. 
Similarly, I believe that there may have been a 2011 state risk assessment in connection with Epstein—is it possible to 
obtain a copy of that? 
thanks very much,

Thank you very much for taking the time today to speak to me regarding the Epstein case. As I mentioned Mr. 
Epstein is a registered Level 3 sex offender in the State Of New York and should he be released and establish 
residence in NYC he is legally obligated to appear at my office ever 90 days. In addition, he is required to have 
a new photo taken every 3 years (his current photo is 9 years old). If he is released his immediate appearance 
at my office should be mandatory. Please feel free to reach out to me should you have any additional 
questions or concerns in this matter.

With apologies for the weekend email, we have a defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, who was arrested last night and is 
currently being detained at MCC, and is expected to be presented on an indictment tomorrow. His attorney, Martin 
Weinberg, has represented him in the past, and represents him in connection with our case and has been in touch with 
us throughout the weekend. He went to MCC today to meet with him in advance of the presentment tomorrow, but 
was just told he is not allowed in because he is from out-of-state. 
We're concerned about the defendant not having access to his attorney in advance of the presentment (as we would be 
for any defendant) and so I wanted to reach out to you—is it at allpossible to address this issue so Mr. Weinberg can 
meet with his client this evening? I'm available anytime at 
o discuss, if that's helpful, or Mr. Weinberg 
can also be reached directly at

just let me know afterward I'd be grateful).

Hey PCU — As you likely may have seen/heard at this point, last evening, we arrested Jeffrey Epstein on sex trafficking 
charges. Epstein is in custody and will be presented and arraigned on an Indictment that will be unsealed tomorrow 
morning. 
The case is an incredibly important one — not only is the conduct extremely serious and deeply disturbing — but our 
charges ensure that dozens if not more of Epstein's victims, girls who were as young as 14 at the time they were abused, 
will finally have their day in court. It is an extraordinarily worthy prosecution and just the latest example of how this 
unit will never shy away from bringing tough cases against powerful people who have committed grievous crimes. 
Please join me and 
in extending a very well-deserved congratulations to the team, 
who have worked tirelessly to make this case happen (and happen so quickly). They have done us all proud, and if you 
are free, we hope you join us for the press conference formally announcing the charges, which should happen Monday 
morning at 11.

Hey 
I I checked with IT a couple times last week, and since 
has been out of the office for quite a bit, it 
seems as if many projects have been put on hold. My understanding, though, is that MIT 
have been working on 
creating a copy of the Confidential items on a hard drive for us to give to the FBI, as well as a separate hard drive for our 
office to have that will contain everything we produced in the Sixth Production. 
Unfortunately, for the last two weeks or so, I've been having trouble connecting with anyone and getting a clear answer 
on its progress. I talked with Ken two weeks ago, and he said he'd confirm with 
and get back to me. I followed up, 
but still have heard nothing. Then, I talked with 
from IT on Friday morning, and he said that he would give 
a call 
Friday afternoon to check on the drive we had requested. He thought that it was still copying, but he was going to double 
check on its status. I followed up with IN Friday afternoon and again yesterday afternoon, but haven't heard anything 
back. I'll follow up again today and hopefully will get a responsel I'll keep you posted. 
Thank you for your patiencel Hopefully we'll get this resolved soon.

No rush at all, but I wanted to check in to see what the plan is for getting copies of all the identified Confidential 
images/videos from Epstein's devices over to the FBI. I'd like the case agents to have a complete set of those materials, 
but it is certainly not time sensitive. Whenever you get a chance to update me on the plan, I'd appreciate it. 
Thanks,

"Is the Epstein case going to cause a problem [for confirmation hearings]?" Acosta 
had been asked. Acosta had explained, breezily, apparently, that back in the day he'd 
had just one meeting on the Epstein case. He'd cut the non-prosecution deal with 
one of Epstein's attorneys because he had "been told" to back off, that Epstein was 
above his pay grade. "I was told Epstein `belonged to intelligence' and to leave it 
alone," he told his interviewers in the Trump transition, who evidently thought that 
was a sufficient answer and went ahead and hired Acosta. (The Labor Department 
had no comment when asked about this.)

This is very helpful. It does not look like we can share the Feb email with the Home Office without 
checking with Bloxsome first. If we share it, he will cite it as just one more reason the US cannot be 
trusted. 
Also, I think this process started before Jan 2020. I have my notes at the Embassy, but I think I started 
working with

dig out my notes when I am back in the office later this week. 
Let me draft an email to

be better in the first instance to deal with this diplomatically and then escalate if unsuccessful.

Dear 
Thank you for your email of 30 January 2020. 
On 10 January 2020 you personally assured me that any contact between the Duke of York and the DOJ was 
confidential and would remain confidential within the investigation team in the DOJ and FBI. You said: "We don't 
intend to share either the contents or the existence of the conversation beyond our chain of command in the DOJ. 
As well as our partners at the FBI. It is confidential within the investigation team and our supervisors." The note I 
made of what you said about the confidentiality of the interview process is as follows: "We do not publicise the 
content or existence of any of our interviews. We can't guarantee that anyone might not share it with some other 
person or it might be shared with other individuals who might come to have knowledge of its existence, but our 
office does not advise the press of the interview and doesn't advise other interviewees of the fact the interview has 
taken place or the contents of those discussions. For example, it was reported widely that our office was 
attempting to interview your client months ago which was inaccurate. We have been working on this request for 
several weeks now and it has not hit the press. That is consistent with our processes. We take confidentiality very 
seriously." 
At no point did you suggest that, because of a press statement made on behalf of the Duke in November 2019, you 
or your colleagues in the investigation team would feel able to provide a public commentary on the DOJ's views on 
the degree of cooperation provided by the Duke. DOJ's first contact of any kind with the Duke was in early January 
2020, and the first mention of any request for consideration of an interview came solely from you. 
I object to your wholly inaccurate statement that the Duke has created a public misimpression. The Duke has made 
it clear that he has a strong desire to cooperate fully with the ongoing investigation by the DOJ. The 
communications between us were intended to enable him to provide that co-operation. In order for this process 
to continue, I need to emphasise that we regard the confidential treatment of all contacts between the DOJ and 
the Duke as essential. We do not wish to have any public pronouncements on what we regard as a voluntary and 
confidential process. Please confirm that any further communications in connection with the requested voluntary 
interview will be treated as wholly confidential and the DOJ will offer no further commentary on the Duke's co-
operation.

Gary, 
On November 20, 2019, Prince Andrew publicly offered to cooperate with our investigation into Jeffrey Epstein's crimes, 
stating in a press release: "Of course, I am willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their 
investigations, if required." In early January 2020, our Office responded to the Prince's public offer by contacting you to 
set up the interview that the Prince claimed to be willing give us. More than three weeks after our initial contact with 
you, we still had no date for an interview, nor did we even have a commitment from you that the Prince in fact would 
agree to an interview. 
On January 27, 2020, at a press event held by Safe Horizon to which Mr. Berman was invited, Mr. Berman was asked: "As 
part of (the Epstein] investigation have you reached out to interview Prince Andrew, and has he been cooperative?" 
Mr. Berman responded: "Ordinarily, our office doesn't comment on whether an individual cooperates or doesn't 
cooperate with our investigation. However, in Prince Andrew's case, he publicly offered, indeed in a press release, 
offered to cooperate with law enforcement investigating the crimes committed by Jeffrey Epstein and his coconspirators. 
So I think in that context, it's fair for people to know whether Prince Andrew has followed through with that public 
commitment. So let me say that the Southern District of New York and the FBI have contacted Prince Andrew's attorneys 
and requested to interview Prince Andrew and to date, Prince Andrew has provided zero cooperation." 
Mr. Berman's statement corrected a public misimpression — created by the Prince himself — that the Prince is cooperating 
with our investigation. 
As soon as the Prince commits to a date for the interview that he so publicly offered to us more than two months ago, we 
would be prepared to announce that he has agreed to be interviewed.

Assistant U.S. Attorney

Dear,

Thank you for your email response claiming that US Attorney Berman's statements were factually accurate and 
did not create a misleading impression. 
We only have access to edited video and newspaper reporting of what the US Attorney said. Those reports 
suggest the US Attorney described the position of the Duke of York and his advisors in misleading, 
condemnatory and prejudicial terms. US Attorney Berman is quoted as having stated there has been "zero co-
operation". This is not an accurate statement of the position. The following are also false statements ascribed to 
Mr Berman and to the Dal/FBI: "F.B.I. agents and federal prosecutors in New York ... reached out to his lawyers 
EFTA00030193
--- PAGE 5 ---
and asked to interview him. There was no response at all, according to three people familiar with the 
investigation." (New York Times 27.01.20) and "Geoffrey Berman, a US attorney, said federal prosecutors and 
the FBI hod asked to interview Prince Andrew about the late paedophile billionaire, but had been met with a 
wall of silence"(The Telegraph 28.01.20). 
Please provide us with an accurate record of the statements made by The US Attorney and/or the DOJ/FBI 
including a transcript of any relevant questions and answers. 
We note from your email that you have not provided any response to our request that you confirm that the DOJ 
will not be making any further public statements about the Duke of York. We had understood from our 
conversations with you and from the rules governing media relations that DOJ personnel and the US Attorney 
would not comment on the nature or progress of any grand jury investigation and in particular would not 
comment on the willingness of any Subject to make a voluntary statement to the Dal. We ask you to confirm 
that there will be no further public comment on any contact between the Duke of York and the DO1.

The press are reporting that Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York has 
disclosed what we understood were confidential communications between us and 
and 
It has also been suggested that Geoffrey S. Berman has stated that the Duke of York has not co-operated with the 
Southern District. As you know we have made it very clear that the Duke of York has a strong desire to cooperate with 
the ongoing investigation by the DOJ and we are trying to reach a position where we are able to advise him to do so. 
We are concerned about the misleading impression that has been created and the effect this has on our ability to 
advise the Duke to proceed with any voluntary co-operation. Please confirm that the DOJ will not be making any further 
public statements on this topic.

Gary, 
Thank you for your response. It would be useful for us if you were able to help us understand the nature of the 
issues and procedures with which you are dealing, particularly as it sounds like it will take at least a couple 
additional weeks to address even minor preliminary issues, which suggests likely additional subsequent time to 
handle further processes—and without a response to the question of whether he is willing to speak with us, 
separate from a general desire to cooperate. Our investigation is moving forward expeditiously and so we would be 
grateful for some understanding of the relevant issues (especially, though not exclusively, to the extent we may be 
able to assist in their resolution) and would be happy to speak via phone if a real-time conversation would be more 
conducive to that discussion.

Thank you for your email. The Duke of York has made it clear to us that he has a strong desire to cooperate fully 
with the ongoing investigation by the DOJ. 
It is our responsibility to deal with the various issues and procedures that arise here that will need to be addressed 
to enable him to do so. We should be able to deal with at least some of the minor preliminary issues in the next two 
weeks and we will update you on our progress once we have done so.

Thank you for your response and for confirming your representation. To respond to your question generally, in 
connection with our investigation of conduct relating to Jeffrey Epstein and certain of his associates, we wish to 
request a consensual, voluntary law enforcement interview with your client. Generally, we would expect to 
inquire about his relationship and communications with Jeffrey Epstein and his associates, as well as certain 
allegations that have arisen publicly and in our investigation to date. 
Although we recognize we separately have the ability to convey such a request through diplomatic and law 
enforcement channels, we understand we may also alternatively inquire directly with counsel, when an 
individual has legal representation. Given your representation, we are inquiring directly with counsel in the 
first instance. 
Certainly we can discuss our request in more detail, but we hope this will provide the information you were 
seeking as a threshold matter, and we look forward to being in touch.

Subject: 
Supporting Documentation for Cardholder/Merchant Data Prepared for 
Law Enforcement 
*Disclaimer: the information provided in the accompanying spreadsheets and described below is 
provided solely for aiding investigation purposes and does not represent official American 
Express data from the respective systems of record. Official documents are maintained and have 
been/will be provided upon request.

2) AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD ACCOUNT ORGANIZATION 
Every American Express credit and charge card has a unique fifteen-digit number ("Card 
Number"). The first eleven digits of this number identify the credit card account ("Card Member 
Account") to which this card belongs. For each Card Member Account there is a primary card 
member who is responsible for paying the balance on all of the supplemental cards associated 
5/14/2019 
AXP Restricted 
Page 1 of 9 
EFTA00030207
--- PAGE 2 ---
with the account. Up to 99 supplemental cards may be associated with a single account. If a 
primary card member has 10 supplemental cards, all II cards would have the same first 11 
numbers. The last four digits of the 11 respective card accounts would be different. 
3) CARD DATA FORMAT (EXCEL SPREADSHEET TABS) 
For investigation purposes only, the Financial Intelligence Unit divides internal data on card 
members into several major categories: Demographic Information ("Demo"), Address, 
Telephone, Record of Charges ("ROC"), Payment, Wire Payments, Returned Payment, Airline, 
and IP Address. This data is displayed in the accompanying Excel spreadsheets with each 
category occupying its own tab. Within each tab, the relevant information is organized by 
labeled columns. If there is no information to report in a particular category, the tab will simply 
not appear on the spreadsheet. A general overview of the information within each tab is provided 
below. 
A. DEMO 
The Demo tab identifies account details and demographic information for both charge and/or 
credit card accounts, listing (where available) the cardholder's name, date of birth, and social 
security number as well as information about the particular credit card product (Gold, Platinum, 
etc.). 
B. ADDRESS 
The Address tab identifies all the addresses that have been associated with each credit card and 
identifies the type of address (home, business, etc.). 
C. TELEPHONE 
The Telephone tab identifies all the telephone numbers that have been associated with each 
credit card and identifies the type of number (Home, Business, ANI). An ANI number is a 
phone number from which the card member or another individual called an American Express 
customer service center about the subject account. The number is captured automatically and the 
date on which the call was made is provided. 
D. ROC (Record of Charges or Spend) 
The ROC tab identifies all completed charges (including credits/retums) a credit card has made 
over the past five years. The tab identifies the date and amount, in U.S. Dollars, of the charge. 
In addition, the tab identifies the merchant at which the charge was made (the unique merchant 
account number, legal and d/b/a name as well as address and industry type). 
E. AUTHORIZATION REQUEST ("CAS") 
The CAS tab identifies all the credit requests a credit card has made over the past one year. 
Every time a card is swiped or keyed into a card reader, a request for credit is sent to American 
Express and an approval code is returned. The request may be approved, denied, or pended. It is 
important to remember that while 90% of all credit requests are charged exactly as requested, 
some credit requests are not charged in the same amount or on the same day. For example, when 
booking a hotel room for four nights, your credit card is swiped and the amount of a four-night 
5/14/2019 
AXP Restricted 
Page 2 of 9 
EFTA00030208
--- PAGE 3 ---
stay is requested; however, your card is not charged at that time but rather at the time of check-
out, at which time your bill might be for more or less than the original credit request. This tab 
also identifies whether the payment attempt was made by swiping or keying the card (keying 
includes internet and phone charges). 
F. PAYMENT 
The Payment tab identifies all the payments that have been made against a credit card balance, 
including dates and amounts, and (where available) information on the bank account on which 
the payment was drawn. 
G. RETURNED PAYMENT 
The Returned Payment tab identifies payments that have been posted against a credit card 
balance and subsequently returned to the payment source. 
H. AIRLINE 
The Airline tab identifies airline ticket charges incurred on a credit card account and contains 
information provided at the time of purchase, including the passenger's name, departure date, 
origin airport, and destination airport. Connecting flight information, if applicable, is generally 
available in the "Itinerary" column. 
I. IP ADDRESS 
The IP Address tab identifies intemet protocol address information captured by American 
Express systems during online account activity (including some purchases, payments, and 
account changes). If an e-mail was sent through the American Express website, the e-mail and 
the IP address from which the customer logged in may have been captured. If a customer 
purchased an item online using an American Express card and provided the merchant with an e-
mail address as the point of contact, that address may also appear in this tab. 
4) PREPAID CARD ACCOUNT ORGANIZATION 
Every American Express prepaid card has a unique fifteen-digit number ("Card Number" or 
"CM15"). Reloadable prepaid card products allow a cardholder to add funds to the account, and 
some may be used to make ATM withdrawals, transfer money, and write checks. Prepaid card 
products also include gift cards, which are predenominated and not reloadable. Some prepaid 
products offer sub-accounts, which are established under the primarily, or "master" account for 
another person age 13 or older. The sub-account is linked to, funded by, and controlled by the 
master accountholder. 
5) RELOADABLE PREPAID DATA FORMAT (EXCEL SPREADSHEET TABS) 
For investigation purposes only, the Financial Intelligence Unit divides internal data on prepaid 
members into several major categories: Demographic Information ("Demo"), Address, 
Telephone, Peer to Peer Transactions ("P2P"), IP Address, Card Transactions, BillPay 
Transactions, Airline Transactions, Funds Load, Withdrawals, Disputes, and Customer Service 
Notes. 
5/14/2019 
AXP Restricted 
Page 3 of 9 
EFTA00030209
--- PAGE 4 ---
The Financial Intelligence Unit divides internal data on other prepaid card members into several 
major categories: Sale Info, Demographic Information ("Demo"), Redemptions ("OR REDE"), 
Authorizations ("OR_AUTH"), Web Balance Inquiry ("OR_WEBBAL"), Direct Deposits, IVR 
Inquiry, and Airlines. 
This data is displayed in the accompanying Excel spreadsheets with each category occupying its 
own tab. Within each tab, the relevant information is organized by labeled columns. If there is no 
information to report in a particular category, the tab will either be blank or not appear on the 
spreadsheet. A general overview of the information within each tab is provided below. 
A. DEMO 
The Demo tab for prepaid accounts associates an account with an individual, listing (where 
available) their name, date of birth, social security number, and email address, as well as 
information about the specific product, account status, and account type (Master, Sub, or 
PurposeDriven (a savings account, which is linked to a master account)). 
B. ADDRESS 
The Address tab identifies all addresses that have been associated with each account, and 
identifies the type of address (home, business, etc.). 
C. TELEPHONE 
The Telephone tab identifies all telephone numbers that have been associated with each account, 
and identifies the type of number (Home, Mobile, Business, ANI, etc.). An ANI number is a 
phone number from which the card member called an American Express customer service center. 
The number is captured automatically and the date on which the call was made is provided. 
D. P2P 
The P2P tab provides information on all P2P transfers (transfers between prepaid accounts) sent 
and received by a particular prepaid account, including account information for all senders and 
recipients. 
E. IP 
The IP Address tab identifies intemet protocol address information captured by American 
Express systems during online account activity. 
F. CARD TRANSACTIONS 
The Card Transactions tab provides information (amount, date, time, and location) on all 
transactions conducted using a prepaid account, including purchases, refunds, and ATM 
withdrawals. For purchases, the tab identifies the merchant where the card was redeemed. 
G. BILLPAY TRANSACTIONS 
The BillPay tab provides information on bills (e.g. credit cards, utilities, rent, etc.) paid by a 
customer using their prepaid account, including the date, transaction amount, and payee name. 
5/14/2019 
AXP Restricted 
Page 4 of 9 
EFTA00030210
--- PAGE 5 ---
H. AIRLINE TRANSACTIONS 
The Airline tab identifies airline ticket charges and contains information provided at the time of 
purchase relating to the departure date, originating airport, destination airport, and passenger 
names. 
I. FUNDS LOAD 
The Funds Load tab provides information on when, where, and how a prepaid account was 
funded (e.g. cash, direct deposit, credit/debit card load, etc.). Note — because in some instances 
the data is maintained by a third party, some credits labeled "cash" may not actually have been 
made via cash payment. For additional questions, please reach out to the Financial Intelligence 
Unit. 
J. WITHDRAWALS 
The Withdrawals tab provides information on money withdrawn from a prepaid account via 
check or ACH transfer, including the date, transaction amount, and transaction status, as well as 
the bank name, account number, and routing number (where applicable). 
K. DISPUTES 
The Disputes tab includes information on transactions disputed by the prepaid accountholder, 
including the dispute date, amount, reason, and resolution. 
L. CUSTOMER SERVICE NOTES 
The Customer Service Notes tab consists of notes recorded by customer service representatives, 
and often includes information regarding customer phone calls, promotional offers, changes to 
demographic information, and changes in account status. 
6) PREPAID GIFT CARDS DATA FORMAT (EXCEL SPREADSHEET TABS) 
A. DEMO 
The Demo tab for prepaid gift cards associates a prepaid card with an individual, and may, in 
limited circumstances, list their name, date of birth, social security number, address, phone 
number, and email address, as well as information about the product type (e.g. reloadable or 
single load) and the card status. 
B. SALE INFO 
The Sale Info tab explains when and where each prepaid card was purchased, as well the original 
load value. 
C. TRANSACTIONS 
The Transactions tab identifies transactions conducted using a prepaid card, including purchases, 
refunds, value loads, promotional credits, and maintenance fees. When money is added to a 
prepaid card, the amount will appear under "redeem amount" as a negative number (for example, 
a value load of $500.00 would be notated as -$500.00). 
5/14/2019 
AXP Restricted 
Page 5 of 9 
EFTA00030211
--- PAGE 6 ---
D. AUTHORIZATIONS 
The Authorizations tab identifies authorization requests submitted by prepaid cards, and whether 
these requests were approved or denied (due to insufficient funds, for example). This tab also 
identifies whether the payment attempt was made by swiping or keying the card (keying includes 
intemet and phone charges). 
E. DIRECT DEPOSIT 
The Direct Deposit tab provides additional information regarding value loads to the account 
made via direct deposit, including the business name and the employee name associated with the 
deposit. 
F. WEB BALANCE INQUIRY AND IVR INQUIRY 
The Web Balance and IVR ("Interactive Voice Response") Inquiry tabs indicate when a 
customer logs in online to review their account and when customer calls in to review their 
account, respectively. 
G. AIRLINES 
The Airline tab identifies airline ticket charges and contains information provided at the time of 
purchase relating to the departure date, originating airport, destination airport, and passenger 
names. 
7) AMERICAN EXPRESS MERCHANT ACCOUNT ORGANIZATION 
Merchant accounts are established for businesses that accept American Express cards, and each 
established merchant account is issued a unique ten-digit number ("merchant account number" or 
"SE10"). Please note that "SE" is frequently used as a synonym for "merchant"; SE stands for 
"Service Establishment." Merchant accounts are associated with an authorized signer and a 
corresponding bank account. The authorized signer serves as the point of contact for the 
merchant account, and that individual's identifying information is stored in internal American 
Express systems, along with the bank account number provided to American Express at account 
opening.' 
8) MERCHANT DATA FORMAT (EXCEL SPREADSHEET TABS 
For investigation purposes only, the Financial Intelligence Unit divides internal data on merchant 
accounts into several major categories: Demographic Information ("SE Demo"), Record of 
Charges ("SE ROC"), Authorization Request ("SE CAS"), Merchant Fraud ("SE Fraud"), 
Merchant Billed ROC ("SE Billed Roc"), Merchant IP ("SE IP"), and Merchant Disputes ("SE 
Disputes"). This data is displayed in the accompanying Excel spreadsheet with each category 
occupying its own tab. Within each tab, the relevant information is organized by labeled 
columns. If there is no information to report in a particular category, then the tab will simply not 
appear on the spreadsheet. A general overview of the information within each tab is provided 
below. 
I The availability of bank account information varies for international merchants. 
5/14/2019 
AXP Restricted 
Page 6 of 9 
EFTA00030212
--- PAGE 7 ---
A. MERCHANT DEMO (SE DEMO) 
The Merchant Demo tab lists the unique merchant account number, the legal name of the 
business, as well as a Doing Business As name (where available). In cases where the merchant 
relationship is not proprietary (i.e., a Seller or Location merchant), additional merchant data will 
be provided in the tab. If the merchant is a Seller Merchant (that is, a third-party merchant 
account that contracts with an "aggregator merchant" that contracts directly with American 
Express to bring merchants to the American Express network), then "Seller" will appear under 
the "Searched Merchant Type" field. If the merchant is a sub-merchant (i.e., acquired under a 
third party payment processor such as Paypal or Square), then "Location" will appear under the 
"Searched Merchant Type." The Merchant Demo tab also provides the reported address and 
telephone number for the business, as well as the name and social security number of the 
authorized signer(s) on the account. This tab further provides a correspondence address for the 
business, a general industry description of the business, and an indication of whether the account 
is open or closed.' Finally, the bank account number (if available based on merchant type) and 
corresponding routing number for each merchant account is listed in the last column to the right 
in the Merchant Demo tab of each spreadsheet. 
B. MERCHANT ROC (SE ROC — RECORD OF CHARGES OR SPEND AT THE 
MERCHANT) 
The Merchant ROC ("Record of Charge") tab identifies all completed American Express charges 
processed by the merchant. The tab identifies the timestamp and amount, in U.S. dollars as well 
as the local amount (if outside of the U.S.) of each charge processed by the merchant. In 
addition, the tab lists the card number and the name of the cardholder that made the purchase, as 
well as some demographic information regarding that cardholder and card (including, but not 
limited to, the cardholder's name, the card type and issuer). 
C. MERCHANT AUTHORIZATION REQUEST (SE CAS) 
This tab lists all credit authorizations sent by the merchant over the past two years. Every time a 
card is swiped or keyed into a card reader, a request for credit is sent to American Express and an 
approval code is returned. The request may be approved, denied, or pended. This tab identifies 
whether the merchant processed the transaction by swiping or keying the card (keying includes 
intemet and phone charges, while swiping typically indicates that the cardholder was physically 
present at the merchant at the time of the transaction). 
D. MERCHANT FRAUD (SE FRAUD) 
This tab identifies all transactions processed by the merchant that were ultimately reported as 
fraudulent by a respective American Express cardholder. 
E. DISPUTES (SE DISPUTES) 
The Disputes tab identifies all initiated charge disputes against a given merchant and the status of 
individual disputes. 
F. MERCHANT BILLED ROC (SE BILLED ROC) 
In the case of Seller and Location merchants, the status information reflects that of the Submitting merchant, and 
not the sub-merchants. 
Bank account information is not available for Seller and Location merchants.

--- PAGE 8 ---
The Merchant Billed ROC tab identifies all completed American Express charges processed by 
the merchant over the past five years. The tab identifies the date and amount, in U.S. dollars, of 
each charge processed by the merchant. In addition, the tab identifies the date and amount of the 
transaction, the card number and the name of the cardholder that made the purchase, as well as 
information regarding that cardholder (In the case of the merchant accounts pulled for the Texas 
Attorney General's Office, please note that due to the size of some of the spreadsheets, the 
BILLED ROC tab was not included. The majority of transactions will appear in the ROC tab). 
G. IP ADDRESS (SE IP) 
The IP tab identifies Internet protocol address information captured by American Express 
systems during online account activity. 
9) PERSONAL SAVINGS ACCOUNT ORGANIZATION 
American Express National Bank issues High-Yield Savings accounts ("HYSAs") and 
Certificates of Deposit ("CDs") to individuals. HYSAs and CDs are both referred to as Personal 
Savings Accounts ("PSAs"). Every PSA has a unique ten-digit or twelve-digit account number 
and may have up to two account holders — a primary account holder and a secondary account 
holder. Each account holder has a unique customer identification number ("Customer ID") and 
has equal access to the PSA. 
10) PERSONAL SAVINGS ACCOUNT DATA FORMAT (EXCEL SPREADSHEET 
TABSI 
For investigation purposes only, the Financial Intelligence Unit divides internal data on PSA 
account holders into several major categories: Demographic Information ("Demo"), Address, 
Notes, Stop-Holds, Transactions, IP Address, and Linked Accounts. 
This data is displayed in the accompanying Excel spreadsheets with each category occupying its 
own tab. Within each tab, the relevant information is organized by labeled columns. If there is no 
information to report in a particular category, the tab will either be blank or not appear on the 
spreadsheet. A general overview of the information within each tab is provided below. 
A. DEMO 
The Demo tab for PSAs associates an account holder with the Customer ID, account number, 
account type, name, date of birth, social security number, employer, job title, income, as well as 
the account status, open and close dates, and maturity or renewal dates for CDs, as applicable. 
B. ADDRESS 
The Address tab lists all addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses that have been 
associated with each account holder, and identifies the types of addresses (e.g., mailing, 
permanent, etc.) and phone numbers (e.g., home, cell, etc.).

AXP Restricted 
Page 8 of 9 
EFTA00030214
--- PAGE 9 ---
C. NOTES 
The Notes tab consists of notes recorded by customer service representatives, and often includes 
information regarding customer phone calls, changes to demographic information or account 
status, information regarding wire transfers, and returned transactions. 
D. STOP-HOLDS 
The Stop-Holds tab identifies deposits made to a PSA and their applicable hold period before the 
funds are available for withdrawal. 
E. TRANSACTIONS 
The Transactions tab provides information and dates for deposits, withdrawals, earned interest, 
internal transfers, account balance of the PSA(s), the method used to make the transactions, and 
external account numbers where available. 
F. IP 
The IP Address tab identifies intemet protocol address information captured by American 
Express systems during online account activity. 
G. LINKED ACCOUNTS 
The Linked Accounts tab includes information for external bank accounts currently or previously 
linked to the PSA(s), including the routing number and bank account number. Each account 
holder is authorized to link up to three external bank accounts to their PSA(s). Of note the 
column "Expiration Date" identifies the date any test transactions are to be conducted for 
verification purposes. Further, the column "Bank Name" displays the account name as chosen 
by the account holder for their own recordkeeping purposes.

Hi 
Hope you're doing well. In connection with the Epstein investigation, we were wondering if you could possibly send 
us the search warrant affidavit and order for the Epstein residence. We understand that it was executed by local 
authorities before the case was brought to the FBI, but we understand you have a copy in the files, and we can't seem 
to locate it in the materials we've reviewed. If you could please email it to us, that would be a big help. 
Thanks in advance for your help, we really appreciate it.

Hey PCU — As you likely may have seen/heard at this point, last evening, we arrested Jeffrey Epstein on sex trafficking 
charges. Epstein is in custody and will be presented and arraigned on an Indictment that will be unsealed tomorrow 
morning. 
The case is an incredibly important one — not only is the conduct extremely serious and deeply disturbing — but our 
charges ensure that dozens if not more of Epstein's victims, girls who were as young as 14 at the time they were abused, 
will finally have their day in court. It is an extraordinarily worthy prosecution and just the latest example of how this unit 
will never shy away from bringing tough cases against powerful people who have committed grievous crimes. 
Please join me and 
in extending a very well-deserved congratulations to the team, 
who 
have worked tirelessly to make this case happen (and happen so quickly). They have done us all proud, and if you are 
free, we hope you join us for the press conference formally announcing the charges, which should happen Monday 
morning at 11.

Mr. 
Thank you very much for taking the time today to speak to me regarding the Epstein case. As I mentioned Mr. 
Epstein is a registered Level 3 sex offender in the State Of New York and should he be released and establish 
residence in NYC he is legally obligated to appear at my office ever 90 days. In addition, he is required to have a 
new photo taken every 3 years (his current photo is 9 years old). If he is released his immediate appearance at 
my office should be mandatory. Please feel free to reach out to me should you have any additional questions or 
concerns in this matter.

Importance: Normal 
ov't Says Epstein Victims Can't Scrap Nonprosecution Deal 
By Carolina Bolado 
Share us on: 
Law360 (June 25, 2019, 4:07 PM EDT) -- Federal 
prosecutors said Monday that billionaire sex offender 
Jeffrey Epstein's victims are not entitled to the relief 
they're seeking — namely the reopening of the 
criminal case against Epstein and an apology — but 
offered to participate in a hearing at which victims 
can provide statements. 
The government said the Crime Victims Rights Act, 
under which two of Epstein's victims sued to 
challenge the nonprosecution agreement, does not 
provide for the relief they want, which includes a 
detailed explanation from prosecutors about their 
decision, an apology and monetary sanctions. 
The court found in the victims' favor in February and 
ruled that prosecutors, including then-U.S. Attorney 
and current Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta, 
violated the CVRA when they signed the 
nonprosecution agreement with Epstein without 
notifying his victims. 
In its response, the government admitted that it 
should have communicated with the victims in a 
more straightforward and transparent way but said 
that does not mean the decision to not prosecute 
Epstein was improper. The remedy should have a

epstein-victims-can-t-scrap-nonprosecution-deal 
EFTA00030231
--- PAGE 2 ---
nexus to the purpose of the CVRA, which is to give 
victims a voice but not to give them decision-making 
authority over prosecutors, according to the 
government. 
"The past cannot be undone; the government 
committed itself to the terms of the [nonprosecution 
agreement], and the parties have not disputed that 
Epstein complied with its provisions," the 
government said. "A number of Epstein's victims 
subsequently invoked the NPA to enter into civil 
settlements with Epstein and, in that respect, also 
relied on its terms. Any remedy for the CVRA 
violation should thus serve to give the victims a 
voice, even though the prosecution decision remains 
out of their hands." 
The government instead proposed a meeting with the 
two plaintiffs, as well as any other Epstein victims 
who want to attend, at which a U.S. Department of 
Justice representative will discuss the government's 
reasoning in resolving the Epstein case. 
The government said prosecutors would also 
participate in a public court proceeding at which any 
Epstein victims can make statements. In addition, all 
criminal prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's Office for 
the Southern District of Florida would undergo 
additional training on the CVRA and victim 
assistance issues. 
"While the court cannot unwind the past, the 
remedies proposed by the government would give the 
victims a meaningful opportunity to have their voices 
heard and to understand, if not accept the decisions 
made in this matter," the government said. 
"Petitioners' requested remedies, on the other hand, 
run afoul of the remedial scheme contemplated by the 
EFTA00030232
--- PAGE 3 ---
CVRA, are contrary to law, and may cause 
unintended harm to the victims whose interests are 
also protected by the CVRA." 
U.S. District Judge Kenneth A. Marra granted 
summary judgment in February to the two victims, 
listed as Jane Does, who sued the government in 
2008 alleging that prosecutors had violated the 
CVRA with the Epstein deal. The judge said the 
government's decision to hide its intentions and to 
tell victims to just be patient with the investigation 
was "particularly problematic." 
Judge Marra rejected the government's claim that the 
CVRA requires victims to be notified only of a plea 
bargain or a deferred prosecution agreement, both of 
which are more common than a nonprosecution 
agreement. That reading of the law is "inconsistent 
with the goal of the CVRA," according to the judge. 
"The expansive context of the CVRA lends itself to 
only one interpretation; namely, that victims should 
be notified of significant events resulting in 
resolution of their case without a trial," Judge Marra 
said. 
The CVRA grants crime victims a number of rights, 
including the right to be informed of public court 
proceedings and not to be excluded from those 
proceedings. The Miami Herald, in an investigative 
report published late last year, printed emails 
showing the alleged victims were deliberately 
excluded from the deal cut between Acosta, who was 
then the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of 
Florida, and Epstein's defense team. 
Brad Edwards, who represents the victims, said his 
clients are disappointed by the government's 
EFTA00030233
--- PAGE 4 ---
response. 
"After sifting through self-serving statistics and 
variations of the same excuses we have heard for 
years, the government took no responsibility for its 
clear wrongdoing and suggests that no remedy is the 
appropriate ruling," Edwards said. "In fact, it acts 
like it is doing the victims a favor by offering to have 
its attorneys voluntarily attend training courses. The 
pleading was the type of slap in the face that we 
expect to see from Mr. Epstein." 
Epstein's alleged victims — numbering in the dozens 
— claim he lured teenage girls to his Palm Beach, 
Florida, mansion to engage in sexual acts. They have 
not had the opportunity to testify in court in any 
proceeding thus far, according to the Herald report. 
Epstein pled guilty in 2008 to state charges involving 
solicitation of prostitution and procurement of minors 
for prostitution. He spent 13 months in prison and is 
registered as a sex offender. 
The victims are represented by Bradley Edwards 
of Edwards Pottinger LLC, Jay C. Howell of Jay 
Howell & Associates PA, John Scarola of Searcy 
Denney Scarola Barnhart & Shipley PA, and Paul G. 
Cassell of the University of Utah's S.J. Quinney 
College of Law. 
The government is represented by Byung J. Pak, Jill 
E. Steinberg and Nathan P. Kitchens of the U.S. 
Attorney's Office for the Northern District of 
Georgia. 
The case is Doe v. U.S., case number 9:08-cv-80736, 
in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of 
Florida.

U.S. Department of Justice 
United States Attorney 
Southern District of New York 
VIA ECF 
The Honorable Richard M. Berman 
United States District Court 
Southern District of New York 
United States Courthouse 
July 12, 2019 
Re: 
United States v. Jeffrey  Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 (RMB) 
Dear Judge Berman: 
The Government respectfully submits this letter in response to the defendant's Motion for 
Pretrial Release (the "Release Motion"), dated July 11, 2019 (Dkt. 6), and in further support of its 
Memorandum in Support of Detention (the "Detention Memo"), submitted to Magistrate Judge 
Pitman on July 8, 2019, which is attached hereto and incorporated herein (Ex. A). 
Simply put, the Release Motion misconstrues and misunderstands the relevant law, belittles 
and smears the many dozens of victims of the defendant's appalling sexual abuse, and utterly fails 
to meet its burden of rebutting the presumption that no condition or combination of conditions will 
reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as required and the safety of the community. 
Rather than even attempting to address the grave risks of releasing a defendant with extraordinary 
financial resources, the defendant instead proposes a bail package that is effectively an unsecured 
bond masquerading as a 14-point plan. The Court should reject the defendant's application and 
order him detained pending trial. 
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 
The defendant is a serial sexual predator who is charged with abusing underage girls for 
years. A grand jury has returned an indictment against him setting forth allegations that he abused 
dozens of minors, including girls as young as 14 years old, in multiple states. To this day, he is 
designated by New York State in the highest category of risk to reoffend, despite his attempts to 
lower that classification. And any doubt that he is unrepentant and unreformed was eliminated 
when law enforcement agents discovered a trove of nude images of young girls in his Manhattan 
mansion on the night of his arrest, more than a decade after he was first convicted of a sex crime 
involving a juvenile. 
The defendant faces substantial evidence of guilt founded on the corroborated testimony 
of numerous victims, and this case presents the very real possibility that he will be go to prison for 
the rest of his natural life. He has at his disposal a vast fortune, nearly all of which remains 
EFTA00030247
--- PAGE 2 ---
Honorable Richard M. Berman 
United States District Judge 
July 12, 2019 
Page 2 
concealed or obscured from the Court and the Government. The defendant also has a history of 
obstruction and manipulation of witnesses, including as recently as when his offenses reemerged 
in the media mere months ago. And he continues to show a shocking lack of understanding of the 
gravity of the harm he has perpetrated, including through the minimization of his conduct and 
casual disparagement of victims in his arguments. 
Against this backdrop of significant—and fast-growing—evidence, serious charges, and 
the prospect of a lengthy prison sentence, the defendant proposes to be released on conditions that 
are preposterously inadequate. While there are no conditions of bail that would reasonably assure 
the defendant's presence in court proceedings or protect the safety of the community, as further 
explained below, the defendant's proposal here is not a serious one. The defendant's Release 
Motion sets forth a woefully inadequate bail package that, among other things, offers to pledge as 
the only security against at least hundreds of millions of net worth a single property that has already 
been designated by the Government for forfeiture and is therefore of no value whatsoever as 
collateral. His proposed global waiver of extradition is unenforceable, and even if enforceable 
would be little comfort to victims forced to wait additional months or years while the defendant is 
located and returned to this country. The promise to "deregister or otherwise ground" his private 
jet is meaningless given his wealth and ability to secure other means of travel, and the two 
co-signers he proposes only reinforce his minimal community ties. Electronic monitoring would 
merely give the defendant less of a head start in fleeing. And the private security force he proposes 
to guard his gilded cage, a proposal already rejected by this Court in similar circumstances, simply 
reinforced the obvious fact that the defendant should be housed where he can be secured at all 
times: a federal correction center. 
The defendant faces a presumption of detention, Pretrial Services has recommended 
detention, and victims of the defendant seek his detention. The Court should order him detained. 
BACKGROUND 
A. Overview and Offense Conduct 
As previously set forth, a federal grand July in this District returned an indictment (the 
"Indictment") charging the defendant with violating Title 18, United States Code Section 1519, 
and conspiracy to commit the same. The defendant argues that the Government "labels this a `Sex 
Trafficking' case," as if the Government invented the term just for this defendant. Release Motion 
at 2. In fact, the title of the statute for which a grand jury has found probable cause to believe the 
defendant violated is: "Sex Trafficking of Children." 18 U.S.C. § 1591. 
As charged by the grand jury, the facts giving rise to those charges involve a years-long 
scheme to sexually abuse underage girls. Specifically, the defendant enticed and recruited dozens 
of minor girls to engage in sex acts with him, for which he paid the victims hundreds of dollars in 
cash, in at least two different states. Victims were initially recruited to provide "massages" to the 
defendant, which would be performed nude or partially nude, would become increasingly sexual 
in nature, and would typically include one or more sex acts, including groping and direct or indirect 
contact with victims' genitals. To perpetuate this exploitation of underage girls, the defendant 
EFTA00030248
--- PAGE 3 ---
Honorable Richard M. Berman 
United States District Judge 
July 12, 2019 
Page 3 
actively encouraged certain victims to recruit additional girls to be similarly sexually abused. He 
paid these victim-recruiters hundreds of dollars for each additional girl they brought to him, 
creating a vast network of underage victims for him to exploit in New York and Palm Beach. 
The defendant keeps making clear the he does not understand the gravity of the offenses 
with which he is charged, including his claim that he has "no criminal history"—other than a 
conviction for engaging in sexual conduct with a minor, precisely the same kind of conduct alleged 
here. And following that conviction, as described previously by the Government, the defendant 
continued to maintain a vast trove of hundreds or thousands of nude photos of young subjects. The 
defendant's victims in this case, often particularly vulnerable girls, were as young as 14 years old 
when he abused them. The defendant knew he was abusing minors, including because victims told 
him directly they were underage. And he abused these victims repeatedly—day after day, month 
after month, year after year. 
The defense calls these appalling acts "simple prostitution."' Mag. Tr. 12:12; see also 
D. Tr. at 6:15-19 ("This is basically the Feds today . . . redoing the same conduct that was 
investigated 10 years ago and calling it, instead of prostitution, calling it sex trafficking"). That 
offensive and horrible labeling of underage girls as prostitutes is unrecognized in federal law, 
which criminalizes commercial sex acts with minors irrespective of the presence or absence of 
force, fraud, or coercion. Defense counsel has already argued repeatedly that the Government's 
case is infirm because no threats or coercion is alleged. Mag. Tr. at 12 ("There was no coercion. 
There were no threats. There was no violence."), 17 ("there was no coercion. There was no 
intimidation. There is no deception."); Release Motion at 2 ("There are no allegations ... that he 
forced, coerced, defrauded, or enslaved anybody ...."). 
The most charitable explanation of this argument is that defense counsel may not yet realize 
with which offense the defendant has been charged, wrongly believing it to be the provision of the 
relevant statute that criminalizes recruitment or enticement of adults for commercial sex through 
means of force, threats of force, fraud, or coercion. The prong under which the defendant is 
charged, conversely, involves minors. As the indictment properly alleges, and the statute provides 
for, where victims are underage, the Government principally must prove that a minor is caused to 
engage in a commercial sex act. See United States v. Afrare, 632 F. App'x 272, 278 (6th Cir. 
2016) ("We hold that § 1591(a) criminalizes the sex trafficking of children (less than 18 years old) 
with or without any force, fraud, or coercion, and it also criminalizes the sex trafficking of adults 
(18 or older), but only if done by force, fraud, or coercion."). 
Here, incredibly, the defense has already effectively admitted that the Government will be 
able to present evidence of these primary elements—that the defendant engaged in sex acts for 
money with girls he knew were underage. See Release Motion at 2. If the defendant dislikes the 
state of federal sex trafficking law, he may petition any of the nine members of Congress who 
"Mag. Tr." refers to the transcript of the hearing before Magistrate Judge Pitman on July 8, 2019; 
"D. Tr." refers to the transcript of the hearing before this Court on July 8, 2019.

represent his places of residence; meanwhile, in the case that has actually been brought, his 
insistence that he is innocent of a crime with which he is not charged is irrelevant. 
B. The Defendant 
It might not occur to a reader of the Release Motion that the defendant is widely reported 
to be a billionaire—indeed, even the word "million" only appears once, to offer up as collateral a 
property the Government has already noticed for seizure and forfeiture. Release Motion at 4. 
Otherwise, there is not a single mention of net worth, income, or valuation of the defendant's vast 
assets. This is, at best, obscurative. 
Put plainly, the defendant is extraordinarily wealthy. According to records from a financial 
institution ("Institution-1") relating to the defendant, in or about 2017, the defendant's estimated 
net worth was listed as "$500 MM +" and his estimated annual income was $10 million. According 
to records from another financial institution ("Institution-2") relating to the defendant, from 2018 
through the present, the defendant's personal and business accounts have spent more than $10 
million on credit cards alone. 
The defendant has six residences, a private jet, an estimated net worth of at least a half a 
billion dollars. His extraordinary incentives to flee, as further discussed below, are equaled by his 
means to do so. 
ARGUMENT 
The Government agrees with Pretrial Services that the defendant should be detained 
pending trial. He is a tremendous risk of flight, and a danger to the community, and he cannot 
overcome the statutory presumption in favor of detention in this case. 
I. 
The Defendant's Proposal Does Nothing to Mitigate His Flight Risk 
Each of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk—the nature and circumstances 
of the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant—
counsel strongly in favor of detention, and the defendant's proposed package would do nothing 
whatsoever to mitigate that risk. 
A. The Defendant's Financial Resources 
As set forth in the Government's Detention Memo, the nature and circumstances of this 
offense and the strength of the evidence create an extraordinary risk of flight. The defendant faces 
up to 45 years of incarceration on the current counts with which he is charged, and the possibility 
of a severe sentence is a significant factor in assessing the risk of flight. See United States v. 
Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 7 (2d Cir. 1987). 
And the evidence of his guilt, already robust less than a week ago when the Indictment was 
unsealed, is growing stronger literally by the day. Several additional women have identified 
themselves to the Government as victims of the defendant. Pursuant to judicially-authorized 
EFTA00030250
--- PAGE 5 ---
Honorable Richard M. Berman 
United States District Judge 
July 12, 2019 
Page 5 
search warrants, the Government has discovered and seized vast amounts of photographs of nude 
and seminude young women and girls in the defendant's Manhattan residence, and is in the process 
of reviewing dozens of electronic discs that contain still more such photos. And dozens of 
individuals have called the Government to convey information regarding the defendant and his 
conduct. All this in less than a week, and all in addition to an Indictment that already alleges 
dozens of victims in New York and dozens of victims in Florida. 
Faced with significant and mounting evidence, the defendant's Release Motion does not 
even attempt to account for the numerous entities, accounts, and assets he controls in the United 
States and abroad. The Court cannot begin to evaluate the defendant's net worth, much less be 
aware of particular obscured, hidden, or foreign-based assets that would further demonstrate the 
defendant's ability to finance a comfortable life beyond the reach of United States authorities. The 
defendant's financial resources are indisputably a relevant aspect of his "history and 
characteristics." 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g)(3); See United States v. Patriarca, 948 F.2d 789, 795 (1st 
Cir. 1991) (explaining that a district court should consider the extent of a defendant's assets and 
net worth before determining the amount of property to be posted as forfeiture condition). 
In the first instance, because the defendant has refused to fill out a financial affidavit in 
connection with his application for bail, the Court simply does not have sufficient information to 
properly and accurately evaluate the defendant's risk of flight. Although the defendant continues 
to hide the true scope, nature, and amount of his assets, he has repeatedly been described as a 
billionaire in press reports, and is identified in documents of his own financial institution as having 
a net worth of $500 million or more. 
As described in the Government's Detention Memo, these resources, which remain 
unknown in scope and would be completely unfettered by the defendant's proposed bail package, 
give the defendant access to innumerable means to flee. The defendant is a frequent traveler and 
regularly travels to and from the United States, including approximately more than 20 flights in 
which he traveled to or from a foreign country since 2018. Extensive international travel of this 
nature further demonstrates a significant risk of flight. See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 384 
F. Supp. 2d 32, 36 (D.D.C. 2005). 
And not only does the defendant have the means to flee thanks to his vast wealth, crucially, 
even were he to sacrifice literally all of his current assets, there is every indication that he would 
immediately be able to resume making millions or tens of millions of dollars per year outside of 
the United States. He already earns an estimated $10,000,000 per year, according to records from 
Institution-1, while living in the U.S. Virgin Islands, traveling extensively abroad, and residing in 
part in Paris, France; there would be little to stop the defendant from fleeing, transferring his 
unknown assets abroad, and resuming whatever it is he does to earn his vast wealth from a 
computer terminal beyond the reach of extradition. 
The defendant is in a position to abandon millions of dollars in cash and property securing 
any potential bond and still live comfortably for the rest of his life. These resources, and the ease 
with which the defendant could flee and live outside the reach of law enforcement make the risk 
of flight unacceptably high.

B. The Defendant's Promise of "Consent" to Extradition is Unenforceable and Impractical 
The theoretical possibility of extradition does not support release, because extradition is 
never guaranteed, and rather is typically lengthy, complicated, and expensive. Additionally, the 
defendant's offer to sign a so-called "consent" to extradition provides no additional reassurance 
whatsoever. Numerous courts have recognized that such purported waivers are unenforceable and 
effectively meaningless. See, e.g., United States v. Morrison, No. 16-MR-118, 2016 WL 7421924, 
at *4 (W.D.N.Y. Dec. 23, 2016); United States v. Kazeem, No. 15 Cr. 172, 2015 WL 4645357, at 
*3 (D. Or. Aug. 3, 2015); United States v. Young, Nos. 12 Cr. 502, 12 Cr. 645, 2013 WL 12131300, 
at *7 (D. Utah Aug. 27, 2013); United States v. Cohen, No. C 10-00547, 2010 WL 5387757, at *9 
n. I I (N.D. Cal. Dec. 20, 2010); United States v. Bohn, 330 F. Supp. 2d 960, 961 (W.D. Tenn. 
2004); United States v. Stroh, No. 396 Cr. 139, 2000 WL 1832956, at *5 (D. Conn. Nov. 3, 2000); 
United States v. Botero, 604 F. Supp. 1028, 1035 (S.D. Fla. 1985). This is for very good reason: 
Any defendant who signs such a purported waiver and then flees will assuredly contest the validity 
and/or voluntariness of the waiver, and will get to do so in the jurisdiction of his choosing (i.e., the 
one to which he chose to flee). The Department of Justice's Office of International Affairs is 
unaware of any country anywhere in the world that would consider an anticipatory extradition 
waiver binding. 
C. Home Confinement and Electronic Monitoring Provide No Assurance 
The defendant's proposal of ankle-bracelet monitoring should be of no comfort to the 
Court. In particular, the defendant's endorsement of a GPS monitoring bracelet rather than a radio 
frequency bracelet is farcical—neither one is useful or effective after it has been removed. At 
best, home confinement and electronic monitoring would merely reduce his head start should he 
decide to flee. See United States v. Zarger, No. 00 Cr. 773, 2000 WL 1134364, at *1 (E.D.N.Y. 
Aug. 4, 2000) (Gleeson, J.) (rejecting defendant's application for bail in part because home 
detention with electronic monitoring "at best ... limits a fleeing defendant's head start"); see also 
United States v. Casteneda, No. 18 Cr. 047, 2018 WL 888744, at *9 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 2018) (same); 
United States v. Anderson, 384 F.Supp.2d 32, 41 (D.D.C. 2005) (same); United States v. Benatar, 
No. 02 Cr. 099, 2002 WL 31410262, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 10, 2002) (same). 
D. Private Security is Inadequate and Raises Numerous Questions and Challenges 
The defendant also proposes the use of a private security force to march him to and from 
court under the threat of deadly force. This proposal should be rejected. 
At the outset, it is far from clear that the defendant's private jail proposal, which seeks to 
replicate the conditions of a government-run detention facility in the defendant's home, is a 
condition of "release" that implicates the Bail Reform Act. "[T]here is a debate within the 
judiciary over whether a defendant, if she is able to perfectly replicate a private jail in her own 
home at her own cost, has a right to do so under the Bail Reform Act and the United States 
Constitution." United States v. Valerio, 9 F. Supp. 3d 283, 292 (E.D.N.Y. 2014) (Bianco, J.) 
(collecting cases). The Second Circuit has never directly addressed this issue. See United States 
v. Sabhnani, 493 F.3d 63, 78 n.18 (2d Cir. 2007) ("The government has not argued and, therefore, 
EFTA00030252

Honorable Richard M. Berman 
United States District Judge 
July 12, 2019 
Page 7 
we have no occasion to consider whether it would be `contrary to the principles of detention and 
release on bail' to allow wealthy defendants `to buy their way out by constructing a private jail." 
(citations omitted)). While "troubled by [the] possibility" of wealthy defendants being allowed to 
construct a private jail, the Second Circuit has not yet had occasion to decide whether district 
courts "routinely must consider the retention of self-paid private security guards as an acceptable 
condition of release before ordering detention." United States v. Banki, 369 Fed. App'x 152, 
153-54 (2d Cir. 2010) (unpublished); see Valerio, 9 F. Supp. 3d at 293-94 (noting that the Bail 
Reform Act addresses solely "conditions of release, not conditions of detention"). Indeed, a 
decision by this Court reasoned that "the very severe restrictions" in the private jail proposal 
presented to him did "not appear to contemplate `release' so much as it describes a very expensive 
form of private jail or detention." United States v. Zarrab, 2016 WL 3681423, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. 
June 16, 2016). 
Courts have long been troubled by private jail proposals like the defendant's which, "at 
best `elaborately replicate a detention facility without the confidence of security such a facility 
instills."' United States v. Orena, 986 F.2d 628, 632 (2d Cir. 1993) (quoting United States v. Gotti, 
776 F. Supp. 666, 672 (E.D.N.Y. 1991) (rejecting private jail proposal)); see also Valerio, 9 F. 
Supp. 3d at 295 ("The questions about the legal authorization for the private security firm to use 
force against defendant should he violate the terms of his release, and the questions over whether 
the guards can or should be armed, underscore the legal and practical uncertainties—indeed, the 
imperfections-of the private jail-like concept envisioned by defendant, as compared to the more 
secure option of an actual jail."). A private security firm simply cannot replicate the controlled 
environment of a federal correctional facility, in which, typically, all of the needs to the prisoner 
can be attended to without placing the prisoner in the community at large; the defendant's proposed 
private jail arrangement would have the effect of permanently placing him in just such a high-
flight-risk circumstance. The risk of a public escape attempt while in the community and involving 
armed private guards attempting to stop the defendant, potentially by force—rather than the 
defendant being in the environment of a federal facility—also greatly magnifies the danger of the 
defendant's flight to the public. See United States v. Boustani, 356 F. Supp. 3d 246, 257 (E.D.N.Y. 
2019) (in rejecting a private jail proposal, noting that it "raise[d] several issues related to use of 
force" including that any escape attempt would "present the risk of a confrontation of armed guards 
and Defendant . . . in the streets of New York city, which would mean that any reduction in the 
Defendant's flight risk from this proposal would be at least partially offset by a greater risk to the 
community") (citation omitted). "This is why, as the Government correctly notes, federal 
prisoners should be detained in facilities run by trained personnel from federal correctional 
facilities." Id. at 258 (citing Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 74 n.13 ("To the extent [armed private guards] 
implies an expectation that deadly force may need to be used to assure defendant['s] presence at 
trial... [s]uch a conclusion would, in fact, demand a defendant's detention")). 
In Banki, the Second Circuit has held that it is not legal error "for a district court to decline 
to accept," as "a substitute for detention," a defendant hiring private security guards to monitor 
him. 369 F. App'x at 154. In the same decision, the Second Circuit noted that it was "troubled" 
by the possibility of "allow[ing] wealthy defendants to buy their way out by constructing a private 
jail." (internal quotation marks omitted)). Accord, e.g., United States v. Cilins, No. 13 Cr. 315 
EFTA00030253
--- PAGE 8 ---
Honorable Richard M. Berman 
United States District Judge 
July 12, 2019 
Page 8 
(WHP), 2013 WL 3802012, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. July 19, 2013) ("It is contrary to underlying 
principles of detention and release on bail that individuals otherwise ineligible for release should 
be able to buy their way out by constructing a private jail, policed by security guards not trained 
or ultimately accountable to the Government, even if carefully selected'" (quoting Borodin v. 
Ashcroft, 136 F. Supp. 2d 125, 134 (E.D.N.Y. 2001))); Valerio, 9 F. Supp. 3d at 293-94 (E.D.N.Y. 
2014) ("There is nothing in the Bail Reform Act that would suggest that a defendant (or even, 
hypothetically, a group of defendants with private finding) has a statutory right to replicate or 
construct a private jail in a home or some other location."). 
The defendant's payment of his guards also raises the conflict of interest inherent in having 
the defendant having extraordinary influence over a private security company tasked with guarding 
him, leaving the company's incentives entirely aligned with the defendant. See, e.g., Boustani, 
356 F. Supp. 3d at 257 (in finding that private armed guards would not reasonably assure the 
appearance of a defendant, noting a "clear conflict of interest—private prison guards paid by an 
inmate" and noting that in a recent S.D.N.Y. case involving private security guards the defendant 
"was outside of his apartment virtually all day, every weekday; was vitited by a masseuse for a 
total of 160 hours in a 30-day period; and went on an unauthorized visit to a restaurant in 
Chinatown with his private guards in tow"); see also United States v. Tajideen, 17 Cr. 046, 2018 
WL 1342475, at *5-6 (D.D.C. Mar. 15, 2018) (Finding Zarrab "particularly instructive" and 
further noting: "While the Court has no reason to believe that the individuals selected for the 
defendant's security detail would intentionally violate federal law and assist the defendant in 
fleeing the Court's jurisdiction, it nonetheless is mindful of the power of money and its potential 
to corrupt or undermine laudable objectives. And although these realities cannot control the Court's 
ruling, they also cannot be absolutely discounted or ignored."). 
Finally, in Zarrab this Court found that "the Defendant's privately funded armed guard 
proposal is unreasonable because it helps to foster inequity and unequal treatment in favor of a 
very small cohort of criminal defendants who are extremely wealthy, such as Mr. Zarrab." 2016 
WL 3681423, at *13; see also Boustani, 356 F. Supp. 3d at 258 ("although this Defendant has vast 
financial resources to construct his own 'private prison,' the Court is not convinced 'disparate 
treatment based on wealth is permissible under the Bail Reform Act"') (quoting United States v. 
Bruno, 89 F. Supp. 3d 425, 432 (E.D.N.Y. 2015) ("Even if Defendant had the financial capacity 
to replicate a private jail within his own home, this Court is not convinced that such a set of 
conditions would be sufficiently effective in this case to protect the community from Defendant, 
or that such disparate treatment based on wealth is permissible under the Bail Act.")); Borodin, 
136 F. Supp. 2d at 134 (E.D.N.Y. 2001) (Nickerson, J.) ("It is contrary to underlying principles of 
detention and release on bail that individuals otherwise ineligible for release should be able to buy 
their way out by constructing a private jail, policed by security guards not trained or ultimately 
accountable to the government, even if carefully selected."). 
The defendant's appearance can only be assured through detention— not through bail 
granted based on hollow promises of an intent to clear his name in the face of weighty evidence 
and a sentence of up to 45 years in jail, not through release on the threat of forfeiture of a mere 
fraction of his wealth and property should he flee, and not through "detention" under the guard of 
individuals to be paid by the defendant himself. Indeed: "What more compelling case for an order 
EFTA00030254

of detention is there than a case in which only an armed guard and the threat of deadly force is 
sufficient to assure the defendant's appearance?" 
Zarrab, 2016 WL 3681432, at *12 
(quoting United States v. Valerio, 9 F. Supp. 3d at 295).

says she 
was told when she witnessed young girls coming to the NY mansion — that they were there for

it appears to be a female.

Hi Marty, 
We do expect to produce them as part of Rule 16 discovery. I expect we may reference financial information in 
connection with filings as necessary appropriate, as we did in Friday's submission, but we'll of course provide the full

Hi, 
Thanks so much for your email. Fully agree --Jenna is the best. This is for an attorney proffer and if possible, Jenna will 
probably join us. 
I'm not sure whether 
legally changed her name, or if I was just given her husband's last name 
her about it tonight. Also happy to ask her about phone numbers for anyone associated with Epstein.

That's great, thanks — and Jenna is fantastic, happy to have her involved. Just to clarify, and to help with our scheduling, I 
take it we'll start with an attorney proffer? Or let me know if I misinterpreted and we're talking about a meeting with the 
client. Either one totally fine but wanted to confirm— let me know and I'll circle back in timing, and will also send you a 
copy of our standard proffer agreement so you have it for your meeting with her this afternoon. 
Two other quick things — first, we know your client as 
but I think you mentioned her name has changed? 
Could you please let me know her current last name? 
And second, one very helpful thing for us would be to have any phone numbers she utilized with Epstein or anyone 
associated with him at that time, and/or numbers for him or others she communicated with in connection with him. 
Primarily, that could help to corroborate and confirm her recollections, and it's something we don't need to talk to her 
directly about to get started working on. If you think it would concern her to provide that at this stage, no problem at all, 
we can circle back to it later, but wanted to mention it. 
thanks,

Hi there, 
Sorry for the delay on our end. Robbie is going to be out of town, but Alex Hess (cc'd here) and I, and our colleague Jenna 
Dabbs (former member of your office), would love to do a proffer with you tomorrow or Friday. We can do it by phone or 
in person, but would prefer to do it in person. 
On Thursday, we are available from 9 to 11AM or after 4PM. On Friday, we are available any time after 11AM. 
What works best for you? 
Thanks!

Following up on our Brass meeting just now, It's that time of year when we need to do forfeiture funding requests. 
These are basically short write-ups of cases that may involve forfeiture and are also likely to incur significant 
investigative costs (e.g., traveling to Florida a dozen times, hiring a vendor retaining an expert). Could you guys do a 
super quick Epstein write up this afternoon and send it back to me (unfortunately need to get these done today — sorry 
for the short notice)? I've attached a blank form and a go-by (you'll see just how short these can be). 
Also, notwithstanding what the form says, please do NOT email it down to DC — please send it back to me.

Hi all, 
As you may already know, pursuant to the Crime Victims' Rights Act, specifically 18 U.S.C. 3771(a)(4), a crime victim has 
the right to be reasonably heard at certain public proceedings in the district court, including proceedings involving 
release. Accordingly, we wanted to be in touch consistent with our responsibilities and obligations—and your client's 
rights—under that statute, to see whether your client would like to be heard in any fashion, whether through a 
submission, a representation that we can include in our bail submission due Friday, or some other form. Of course no 
requirement or obligation, but we would be happy to discuss it if that would be useful. 
To the extent this information is useful in your consideration, I can say that while I don't want to prejudge the 
Would it make sense to set up a brief call sometime tomorrow, if any of you want to discuss? I should be able to make

1lope all is well at the Office. Would love to get together for lunch or something sometime soon. Just reaching 
out because I believe you are handling the Epstein case and that Berman is assigned. I assume you all know this, 
but Judge Berman had the Cameron Douglas case, which I handed with Jeff Brown at the time, and Cameron 
Douglas was granted bail with various requirements that he reside in his NY apartment with 24 hr surveillance 
paid for by him etc. He ultimately violated those conditions by smuggling drugs via an electric toothbrush. 
Berman is obviously well aware of the situation and it could be a helpful data point for you all if you don't 
already know about it (not sure anyone is left with the institutional knowledge of that case).

Hey =, 
So far so good here, thanks — just trying to deal with the tech issues of working from home (not to mention the inability to 
interview witnesses!) but really can't complain at all, the girlfriend and I are both healthy and distancing. Hope that's true 
for you and yours too. 
In terms of the issues below, unfortunately there isn't any progress — it's not a delay on our end, we've run the taint 
screen and so the AUSAs and agents all have access on Relativity to the materials that 
sent over in December. We 
also sent the privilege taint terms to the agents a couple weeks ago so they could run the screen on whatever programs 
they may be using — that's attached. We hadn't realized that they were impeded on their review due to any taint issue, 
we just thought they were using Relativity, same as us. 
More generally though, the issue we continue to have is the same one since February. We have absolutely no sense of 
what 
sent to us — it's not organized or identified by device or even by location, the documents aren't joined with 
their attachments (their "families" in the terms of doc review), we can't look at native files, etc. It's all the issues from my 
March 9 email, below, which 
never responded to. And it's only 1.4 million documents out of what are presumably 
tens of millions total — we haven't gotten any version of the rest (and don't know exactly what we're missing, because 
again, we have no way to track what we've been given so far). 
If 
(and/or others at CART) are teleworking, it would be great to get help on this, because obviously weeks are going 
by that we could be using to review. I had been trying to push my chiefs for a meeting in early March but then obviously 
the world imploded! So not sure what can be done currently, but happy to discuss with anybody that would be useful. 
thanks as always,

totally happy to chat, and it's exactly the same issues as we talked about on the phone a couple weeks ago when 
we first raised this -- I wonder if it makes sense to get in a room together? Otherwise it's a lot of games of telephone. 
But basically the way to think about it is, imagine if we had seized papers from approximately 100,000 filings cabinets in 
a dozen different office buildings. And then instead of keeping them organized or labeled by room, or even by office 
building, all 1.3 million documents (so far) just got dumped into one big pile — except before that, any documents that 
had multiple parts stapled together got separated. And then if any of those documents that was larger than about 100 
pages couldn't be opened. That's what we've got, just electronically.

Unfortunately I don't think this is very helpful to us. Did you take a look at the example spreadsheet I sent on 2/24? 
The excel file you sent has descriptions that don't match up to the items listed in the search warrant returns (that we 
sent on 2/23), and we don't have the 16 or CART numbers to be able to cross-reference. We also can't tell what you 
mean by "loose media" without a specific comparison to what was seized, we don't know which items you're referring 
to as "Windows machines," and we can't tell whether the entirety of any particular item has been transferred, or just 
partial. For example, it looks like we have gotten very, very few image files, which is surprising. 
We have also encountered some very significant problems in trying to review the more than 1 million documents we 
recently received: 
The data we've received has no way to put any emails and attachments together. So if an email says, "see the 
attached flight records," for example, we have no way of linking that up with the records themselves. Not only 
is that a big problem for us in review, it's going to be a huge problem for producing the documents to defense 
counsel. 
- 
The load file has no link to the native file, so when we load the data to the database, there's no way to have 
the native files show up in the database. Because many of the files are too large to open in the viewer, it 
effectively means that there are many files that are completely invisible to us. 
Related, the control numbers in the load file don't match up to the native files. So we have two sets of 
numbers and no way to match up anything—that is, even if we were to try to go hunt down every individual 
large file in the native files, it would be impossible. 
So the data that we most recently got, we need to get in a form that addresses those issues, and we likely will need to 
get a similar reproduction of the data we received a couple months ago. Otherwise we're sifting through more than a 
million documents without much rhyme or reason. 
I've re-attached the spreadsheet we sent last week — I think that's a good place to start in terms of our necessary 
record-keeping, and we need that info at the very least, as well as anything else you think would be useful. Also 
attaching the SW returns for reference. And again, we're happy to meet up anytime and hash all this out in person if 
that's useful. 
thanks,

Here is a listing of what I have already handed over in load files to the US Attorney's Office for taint review. Some points 
of clarification: There were 9 IDE hard drives found in the Manhattan apartment, they turned out to be 3 copies of 3 
drives (9 drives in total) from a July 2007 search on one of his properties. I only processed 3 (as they were all copies). All 
the loose media from the NY apartment is included. All the Windows machines from the NY apartment are included. 
Only 2 Macs from NY and 1 from the Island are included.

I will have to more closely coordinate with whoever is loading up Relativity with the remaining Macs as the 
tool they have to be processed with does not easily re-name the load files.

Totally understand about the network issues—we can relate. I do still think it will be helpful to all sit down together to 
have an in-person discussion, to make sure everybody is on the same page. Are folks available for that next week? And 
what I think would be most helpful to facilitate that would be a spreadsheet of each separate device referenced in the 
two search warrant returns, with columns for whether we've dumped the contents, whether they've been reviewed 
and/or transferred, what portions were transferred, etc. 
Something roughly like the attached, with any other categories you think would be useful — and the info on the 
attached is mostly hypothetical, obviously, just as examples. That will help us fully understand what's been reviewed, 
transferred, and received so far, and what remains. 
(Also just on the pictures, we do want copies of those as well, please including from the discs and the devices — I think 
FBI was going to do an initial screen to make sure no CP, and since I think the answer was no, we'll need to get those to 
be able to review them as well.)

Sorry for the delayed response. They are tearing out our old network and giving us a new one, they mandated 
we delete old stuff (about 400 TB worth). Now that they are working on replacing the network, we can do only 
local work. I should be able to give you an accounting of what is what. I can say, off the top of my head, that 
all windows based items from the NY search have been handed over as well as all loose media. The CDs from 
NY only contained pictures, no documents. There are still some Apple items from NY that need to be 
produced. As far as the Island stuff goes, the 1st item on your spreadsheet, the "kitchen" mac has been 
produced. Still working on the rest.

Following up on the below from last weekend, I'm still not sure how we're addressing this so I thought it would make 
sense for us to all schedule a (hopefully relatively brief) meeting to all get on the same page? We didn't hear back on 
which files had previously been provided, but our tech folks did their best to differentiate, and we got access to the 
materials yesterday and its well over a million documents, and we don't have any idea what we're looking at — i.e., 
EFTA00030313
--- PAGE 6 ---
which devices the materials came from, whether it's full or partial results, how many more devices we have coming, 
etc. 
Based on the attached search warrant returns, it looks like from the New York mansion (the PDF) there are 
approximately 40 devices that would have storage (computers, hard drives, thumb drives, etc.) and that's not even 
counting at least 60+ CDs. And then from the Virgin Islands (the Excel spreadsheet), at least more than 25 devices, 
including multiple servers / server racks. 
So we gotta know what we've already received, what remains, anticipated schedule, etc, and I know it's a lot of moving 
pieces on all sides so wanted to loop in everybody at once. The case team will be in California this coming week from 
Tuesday through Friday, but then I think generally around the first week of March, which will hopefully be plenty of 
time to schedule a productive meeting.

I'm not sure who's the exact right person to ask this, so wanted to get everybody on one email chain about it — I have 
the hard drive that 
dropped off that has new Epstein search warrant materials, but it looks like there are also 
old materials (that I think we had previously received and uploaded??) on the hard drive, and so I'm not sure what's 
new. 
Just generally, and 
and I talked about this last week too, but it's basically impossible for us to keep track of what 
we're getting, and what has been completed, without some kind of identification or labeling system, along with a list of 
which devices have been extracted and downloaded. 
So for example on the hard drive currently, there are 38 folders labeled "loadFiles" through "37loadFiles" with a 
modified date of 11/14/19, which I think we may have already previously received — but I'm not sure, because we 
haven't gotten any info on which folders match up to which devices, etc. And then there's another folder titled 
"NYC024362" that has a modified date of 1/27/20, so I think that may be the materials we hadn't previously received? 
That folder by itself has more than 600,000 items. 
I don't want to give 
anything that we've already previously received and uploaded, and I can't tell from the folder 
or file names whether everything on the drive is new, or whether just additional materials were saved onto it in 
addition to what we already have. =, 
are you able to give us some guidance on this? Ultimately what we really 
need is a spreadsheet of every device, whether it's been dumped (or partially dumped), and then identifying that same 
info — which device, and what materials from it — are being given to us with each data transfer. Otherwise I think 
organizationally and for review purposes it will be a total disaster for us. 
We're happy to have a meeting on this if that's helpful — and thanks everybody for the assistance.

Unfortunately I don't think this is very helpful to us. Did you take a look at the example spreadsheet I sent on 2/24? The 
excel file you sent has descriptions that don't match up to the items listed in the search warrant returns (that we sent on 
2/23), and we don't have the 1B or CART numbers to be able to cross-reference. We also can't tell what you mean by 
"loose media" without a specific comparison to what was seized, we don't know which items you're referring to as 
"Windows machines," and we can't tell whether the entirety of any particular item has been transferred, or just partial. 
For example, it looks like we have gotten very, very few image files, which is surprising. 
We have also encountered some very significant problems in trying to review the more than 1 million documents we 
recently received: 
The data we've received has no way to put any emails and attachments together. So if an email says, "see the 
attached flight records," for example, we have no way of linking that up with the records themselves. Not only is 
that a big problem for us in review, it's going to be a huge problem for producing the documents to defense 
counsel. 
The load file has no link to the native file, so when we load the data to the database, there's no way to have the 
native files show up in the database. Because many of the files are too large to open in the viewer, it effectively 
means that there are many files that are completely invisible to us. 
Related, the control numbers in the load file don't match up to the native files. So we have two sets of numbers 
and no way to match up anything—that is, even if we were to try to go hunt down every individual large file in the 
native files, it would be impossible. 
So the data that we most recently got, we need to get in a form that addresses those issues, and we likely will need to get 
a similar reproduction of the data we received a couple months ago. Otherwise we're sifting through more than a million 
documents without much rhyme or reason. 
I've re-attached the spreadsheet we sent last week — I think that's a good place to start in terms of our necessary record-
keeping, and we need that info at the very least, as well as anything else you think would be useful. Also attaching the SW 
returns for reference. And again, we're happy to meet up anytime and hash all this out in person if that's useful.

Totally understand about the network issues—we can relate. I do still think it will be helpful to all sit down together to 
have an in-person discussion, to make sure everybody is on the same page. Are folks available for that next week? And 
what I think would be most helpful to facilitate that would be a spreadsheet of each separate device referenced in the two 
search warrant returns, with columns for whether we've dumped the contents, whether they've been reviewed and/or 
transferred, what portions were transferred, etc. 
Something roughly like the attached, with any other categories you think would be useful — and the info on the attached is 
mostly hypothetical, obviously, just as examples. That will help us fully understand what's been reviewed, transferred, 
and received so far, and what remains. 
(Also just on the pictures, we do want copies of those as well, please including from the discs and the devices — I think FBI 
was going to do an initial screen to make sure no CP, and since I think the answer was no, we'll need to get those to be 
able to review them as well.)

Sony for the delayed response. They are tearing out our old network and giving us a new one, they mandated we 
delete old stuff (about 400 TB worth). Now that they are working on replacing the network, we can do only local 
work. I should be able to give you an accounting of what is what. I can say, off the top of my head, that all 
windows based items from the NY search have been handed over as well as all loose media. The CDs from NY 
only contained pictures, no documents. There are still some Apple items from NY that need to be produced. As

Following up on the below from last weekend, I'm still not sure how we're addressing this so I thought it would make 
sense for us to all schedule a (hopefully relatively brief) meeting to all get on the same page? We didn't hear back on 
which files had previously been provided, but our tech folks did their best to differentiate, and we got access to the 
materials yesterday and its well over a million documents, and we don't have any idea what we're looking at — i.e., which 
devices the materials came from, whether it's full or partial results, how many more devices we have coming, etc. 
Based on the attached search warrant returns, it looks like from the New York mansion (the PDF) there are approximately 
devices that would have storage (computers, hard drives, thumb drives, etc.) and that's not even counting at least 60+ 
CDs. And then from the Virgin Islands (the Excel spreadsheet), at least more than 25 devices, including multiple servers / 
server racks. 
So we gotta know what we've already received, what remains, anticipated schedule, etc, and I know it's a lot of moving 
pieces on all sides so wanted to loop in everybody at once. The case team will be in California this coming week from 
Tuesday through Friday, but then I think generally around the first week of March, which will hopefully be plenty of time 
to schedule a productive meeting.

I'm not sure who's the exact right person to ask this, so wanted to get everybody on one email chain about it — I have the 
hard drive that 
dropped off that has new Epstein search warrant materials, but it looks like there are also old 
materials (that I think we had previously received and uploaded??) on the hard drive, and so I'm not sure what's new. 
Just generally, and 
and I talked about this last week too, but it's basically impossible for us to keep track of what 
we're getting, and what has been completed, without some kind of identification or labeling system, along with a list of 
which devices have been extracted and downloaded. 
So for example on the hard drive currently, there are 38 folders labeled "loadFiles" through "37loadFiles" with a modified 
date of 11/14/19, which I think we may have already previously received — but I'm not sure, because we haven't gotten 
any info on which folders match up to which devices, etc. And then there's another folder titled "NYC024362" that has a 
modified date of 1/27/20, so I think that may be the materials we hadn't previously received? That folder by itself has 
more than 600,000 items. 
I don't want to give 
anything that we've already previously received and uploaded, and I can't tell from the folder or 
file names whether everything on the drive is new, or whether just additional materials were saved onto it in addition to 
what we already have. =, 
are you able to give us some guidance on this? Ultimately what we really need is a 
spreadsheet of every device, whether it's been dumped (or partially dumped), and then identifying that same info —
which device, and what materials from it — are being given to us with each data transfer. Otherwise I think 
organizationally and for review purposes it will be a total disaster for us. 
We're happy to have a meeting on this if that's helpful — and thanks everybody for the assistance.

any info on which folders match up to which devices, etc. And then there's another folder titled "NYCO24362" that has a 
EFTA00030333
--- PAGE 6 ---
modified date of 1/27/20, so I think that may be the materials we hadn't previously received? That folder by itself has 
more than 600,000 items. 
I don't want to give 
anything that we've already previously received and uploaded, and I can't tell from the folder or 
file names whether everything on the drive is new, or whether just additional materials were saved onto it in addition to 
what we already have. =, 
are you able to give us some guidance on this? Ultimately what we really need is a 
spreadsheet of every device, whether it's been dumped (or partially dumped), and then identifying that same info —
which device, and what materials from it — are being given to us with each data transfer. Otherwise I think 
organizationally and for review purposes it will be a total disaster for us. 
We're happy to have a meeting on this if that's helpful — and thanks everybody for the assistance.

No problem! Good luck with everything. I don't think there's any hard deadline on the request because we're not in court 
and they didn't send a subpoena. So the main constraint is Glassman's annoyance. I wrote him a brief note back last night, 
although I doubt that will keep him happy for very long. I try not to provide specific timelines on stuff like this, but if we 
need too much more time I can try letting him know a more specific sense of timing. Thanks!

Hey I apologize for the delay — our entire team has been absolutely swamped for the past two weeks; we indicted 
Ghislaine Maxwell yesterday and now are working on arrest plans, and it's been insane. I very much hope to be able to 
take care of this next week, it's just been one thing after another for a little while.

UNITED STATES ATTORNEY'S OFFICE 
Southern District of New York 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL CHARGED IN MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURT FOR 
CONSPIRING WITH JEFFREY EPSTEIN TO SEXUALLY ABUSE MINORS 
Maxwell is Alleged to Have Facilita- ted, Participated in Acts of Abuse 
Additionally Charged With Perjury in Connection With 2016 Depositions 
Audrey Strauss, the Acting United States Attorney- for the Southern District of New York, William F. 
Sweeney Jr., the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation ("FBI"), and Dermot Shea, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department ("NYPD"), 
announced that GHISLANE MAXWELL was arrested this morning and charged with enticing a minor to travel 
to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, 
conspiracy to commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. The Indictment 
unsealed today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 through 1997, MAXWELL and co-conspirator 
Jeffrey Epstein exploited girls as young as 14, including by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the 
purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference for young girls, 
MAXWELL played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations 
including New York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, MAXWELL made several false 
statements in sworn depositions in 2016. MAXWELL is expected to be presented this afternoon in the in federal 
court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan. 
Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated, aided, and 
participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then 
delivered them into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust. 
EFTA00030347
--- PAGE 2 ---
All the while, she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself. 
Today, after many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the 
most important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the 
law and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth into 
behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the quest for 
justice has been met with great disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. The 
example set by the women involved has been a powerful one. They persevered against the rich and connected, 
and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a subpoena - and they stood together. I have no doubt the bravery 
exhibited by the women involved here has empowered others to speak up about the crimes of which they've been 
subjected." 
NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said: "The heinous crimes these charges allege are, and always will 
be abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement 
partners, for their continuing commitment to bringing justice to the survivors of sexual assault, everywhere." 
If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, please contact 
the FBI at 1-800-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
According to the Indictment[l I unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated 
in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, 
which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies or 
taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at 
ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. 
Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to accept offers of 
financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. MAXWELL also 
normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, encouraging them to massage 
Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and 
susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between 
minor victims and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL 
was present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages 
during which a minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein 
involving a minor victim where MAXWELL was present. 
As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching 
of a victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to 
touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and 
Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as 
well as MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
EFTA00030348
--- PAGE 3 ---
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal 
sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to 
travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of 
transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, which carries a maximum sentence of 
years in prison, one count of conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual 
activity, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and two counts of perjury, each of which 
carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
The statutory maximum penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational 
purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be determined by the judge. 
Ms. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and the NYPD.

Southern District of New York 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL CHARGED IN MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURT FOR 
CONSPIRING WITH JEFFREY EPSTEIN TO SEXUALLY ABUSE MINORS 
Maxwell is Alleged to Have Facilita- ted, Participated in Acts of Abuse 
Additionally Charged With Perjury in Connection With 2016 Depositions 
Audrey Strauss, the Acting United States Attorney- for the Southern District of New York, William F. 
Sweeney Jr., the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation ("FBI"), and Dermot Shea, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department ("NYPD"), 
announced that GHISLANE MAXWELL was arrested this morning and charged with enticing a minor to travel 
to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, 
conspiracy to commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. The Indictment 
unsealed today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 through 1997, MAXWELL and co-conspirator 
Jeffrey Epstein exploited girls as young as 14, including by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the 
purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference for young girls, 
MAXWELL played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations 
including New York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, MAXWELL made several false 
statements in sworn depositions in 2016. MAXWELL is expected to be presented this afternoon in the in federal 
court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan. 
Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated, aided, and 
participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then 
delivered them into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust.

--- PAGE 2 ---
All the while, she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself. 
Today, after many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the 
most important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the 
law and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth into 
behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the quest for 
justice has been met with great disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. The 
example set by the women involved has been a powerful one. They persevered against the rich and connected, 
and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a subpoena - and they stood together. I have no doubt the bravery 
exhibited by the women involved here has empowered others to speak up about the crimes of which they've been 
subjected." 
NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said: "The heinous crimes these charges allege are, and always will 
be abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement 
partners, for their continuing commitment to bringing justice to the survivors of sexual assault, everywhere." 
If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, please contact 
the FBI at 1-800-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
According to the Indictment[l I unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated 
in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, 
which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies or 
taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at 
ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. 
Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to accept offers of 
financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. MAXWELL also 
normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, encouraging them to massage 
Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and 
susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between 
minor victims and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL 
was present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages 
during which a minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein 
involving a minor victim where MAXWELL was present. 
As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching 
of a victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to 
touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and 
Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as 
well as MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
EFTA00030354

GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal 
sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to 
travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of 
transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, which carries a maximum sentence of 
years in prison, one count of conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual 
activity, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and two counts of perjury, each of which 
carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
The statutory maximum penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational 
purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be determined by the judge. 
Ms. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and the NYPD.

and 
are in charge of the prosecution.

and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a subpoena - and they stood together. I have no doubt the bravery

subjected."

If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, please contact 
the FBI at 1-800-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
According to the Indictment[ I I unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated 
in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, 
which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies or 
taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at 
ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. 
Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to accept offers of 
financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. MAXWELL also 
normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, encouraging them to massage 
Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and 
susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between 
minor victims and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL 
was present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages 
during which a minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein 
involving a minor victim where MAXWELL was present.

As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching 
of a victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to 
touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and 
Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as 
well as MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal 
sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to 
travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of 
transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, which carries a maximum sentence of 
years in prison, one count of conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual 
activity, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and two counts of perjury, each of which 
carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
The statutory maximum penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational 
purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be determined by the judge. 
Ms. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and the NYPD. 
This case is being handled by the Office's Public Corruption Unit. Assistant U.S. Attorneys 
and 
are in charge of the prosecution. 
The charges contained in the Indictment are merely accusations. The defendant is presumed innocent 
unless and until proven guilty.

GHISLAINE MAXWELL CHARGED IN MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURT FOR 
CONSPIRING WITH JEFFREY EPSTEIN TO SEXUALLY ABUSE MINORS 
Maxwell is Alleged to Have Facilita- ted, Participated in Acts of Abuse 
Additionally Charged With Perjwy in Connection With 2016 Depositions 
Audrey Strauss, the Acting United States Attorney- for the Southern District of New York, William F. 
Sweeney Jr., the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation ("FBI"), and Dermot Shea, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department ("NYPD"), 
announced that GHISLANE MAXWELL was arrested this morning and charged with enticing a minor to travel 
to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, 
conspiracy to commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. The Indictment 
unsealed today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 through 1997, MAXWELL and co-conspirator 
Jeffrey Epstein exploited girls as young as 14, including by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the 
purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference for young girls, 
MAXWELL played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations 
including New York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, MAXWELL made several false 
statements in sworn depositions in 2016. MAXWELL is expected to be presented this afternoon in the in federal 
court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan. 
Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated, aided, and 
participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then 
delivered them into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust. 
All the while, she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself. 
Today, after many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the 
most important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the 
law and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth into 
behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the quest for 
justice has been met with great disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. The 
example set by the women involved has been a powerful one. They persevered against the rich and connected, 
and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a subpoena - and they stood together. I have no doubt the bravery 
exhibited by the women involved here has empowered others to speak up about the crimes of which they've been 
subjected." 
NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said: "The heinous crimes these charges allege are, and always will 
be abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement 
partners, for their continuing commitment to bringing justice to the survivors of sexual assault, everywhere."

UNITED STATES ATTORNEY'S OFFICE 
Southern District of New York 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL CHARGED IN MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURT FOR 
CONSPIRING WITH JEFFREY EPSTEIN TO SEXUALLY ABUSE MINORS 
Maxwell is Alleged to Have Facilita- ted, Participated in Acts of Abuse 
Additionally Charged With Perjwy in Connection With 2016 Depositions 
Audrey Strauss, the Acting United States Attorney- for the Southern District of New York, William F. 
Sweeney Jr., the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation ("FBI"), and Dermot Shea, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department ("NYPD"), 
announced that GHISLANE MAXWELL was arrested this morning and charged with enticing a minor to travel 
to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, 
conspiracy to commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. The Indictment 
unsealed today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 through 1997, MAXWELL and co-conspirator 
Jeffrey Epstein exploited girls as young as 14, including by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the 
purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference for young girls, 
EFTA00030381
--- PAGE 2 ---
MAXWELL played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations 
including New York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, MAXWELL made several false 
statements in sworn depositions in 2016. MAXWELL is expected to be presented this afternoon in the in federal 
court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan. 
Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated, aided, and 
participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then 
delivered them into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust. 
All the while, she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself. 
Today, after many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the 
most important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the 
law and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth into 
behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the quest for 
justice has been met with great disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. The 
example set by the women involved has been a powerful one. They persevered against the rich and connected, 
and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a subpoena - and they stood together. I have no doubt the bravery 
exhibited by the women involved here has empowered others to speak up about the crimes of which they've been 
subjected." 
NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said: "The heinous crimes these charges allege are, and always will 
be abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement 
partners, for their continuing commitment to bringing justice to the survivors of sexual assault, everywhere." 
If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, please contact 
the FBI at 1-800-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
According to the Indictment[ I I unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated 
in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, 
which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies or 
taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at 
ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. 
Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to accept offers of 
financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. MAXWELL also 
normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, encouraging them to massage 
Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and 
susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between 
minor victims and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL 
was present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages 
during which a minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein 
involving a minor victim where MAXWELL was present. 
EFTA00030382
--- PAGE 3 ---
As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching 
of a victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to 
touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and 
Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as 
well as MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal 
sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to 
travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of 
transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, which carries a maximum sentence of 
years in prison, one count of conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual 
activity, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and two counts of perjury, each of which 
carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
The statutory maximum penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational 
purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be determined by the judge. 
Ms. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and the NYPD. 
This case is being handled by the Office's Public Corruption Unit. Assistant U.S. Attorneys

been having additional afternoon calls, so that's helpful to know. Also helpful to know that you have not received

Apologies all, I just saw these emails. We are not providing weekend calls generally at this time, and counsel has been 
having 2 hour legal calls every afternoon in addition to the standing call set up in the morning. This is far more than 
almost every other inmate receives prior to an arraignment. Most other arraignments have been set up with one or two 
days notice, with only one call to counsel and one call to pretrial services. 
I have received no calls or emails from counsel, so I'm not sure where they have made these emergency requests. 
They will have another call with her tomorrow, and I can let staff know they will request the call on Tuesday as well.

Following up, we heard from defense counsel that they didn't receive a call this morning either and that they filed an 
emergency request but haven't heard back. Please let us know the status as soon as possible? They also wanted to 
confirm that they will have calls at 10:00 tomorrow and Tuesday. Again, we realize this is unusual but Fm not aware of 
any other defendants who are in this circumstance of having a bail hearing pending in just two days. Also copying 
in case he's aware of someone else we should contact.

Truly urgent requests can be sent to me, but unless there is a last minute, imminent court deadline,

Thank you so much, 
A 10am standing legal call every day before the arraignment on Tuesday 7/14 would be perfect if that's 
something you would be able to accommodate. Defense counsel will be available at that time, and they are 
very grateful for the time. 
We have also conveyed to defense counsel that they will need to follow the same protocols as other inmates' 
counsel following the arraignment. Thank you for letting us know about the lack of requests from defense 
counsel thus far. There appears to be some confusion on their end about how to submit requests to schedule 
legal calls. Would you be able to please share with us the procedure that they should follow, so that we can 
make sure they understand what steps to take going forward? 
Thank you again for all of your help—we really appreciate it.

You're welcome. 
Would 10 am work as a standing legal call through the end of this week (and Monday, if you think that's a good 
idea), in advance of the arraignment on Tuesday? However, after this, defense counsel should be required to 
follow the same protocols as all other inmates' counsel with respect to requesting legal calls. 
I also just want to make clear that defense counsel sent no requests yesterday that I am aware of, and we were 
able to facilitate a call yesterday evening following a request from your office, and today, I received one request, 
about mid-day, that we were again able to accommodate. So, I do not think it is fair at all to categorize this as 
defense counsel having difficulty scheduling legal calls.

Thanks, 
This is about the legal call today. In addition, because defense counsel his having difficulty 
scheduling legal calls, it would be helpful if MDC could schedule standing calls for the rest of this week to 
address this issue. Thanks very much.

Hope you're doing well. This evening, Judge Nathan directed the parties in the US v. Ghislaine Maxwell case to 
file a letter by 9pm today. Defense counsel need to speak with Ms. Maxwell this evening about the letter, but 
they have not been able to reach her. Would it be possible to allow Ms. Maxwell to make a legal call to her

Everything with the exception of a couple of items are ready. I will get you an actual number before I send it over. 
We can send it over tomorrow. There will be ReadMe files included so it will be easy to see where the items came from. I 
am a little worried about how the e-mail will present. While looking through on a spot check, the attachments are not 
connected to the e-mails in the forensic tool. I believe it is a function of the e-mail client they were using to begin with. I 
know that the attachments are a concern of yours. We may have to massage things a bit to get it right. Now that we are 
working every day, and everything has been processed, it shouldn't be too big a deal. So far the export is about 350 GB. It 
copies slowly because it is a ton of pretty small files. You are getting the whole ball of wax, here, Macs, Windows boxes, 
loose media, etc. There will be a few iPhone and iPad reports, but unsure if I can get you those tomorrow as they very 
often take a LONG time to copy. Again, lots of small files. If not tomorrow, the next day. 
Are you around tomorrow? Reach out to me when you get the production so we can correct any problems we might 
encounter. Thanks.

I understand that some number of the devices are ready to come to us as early as today or tomorrow. Could you please 
let us know the following information, so we can figure out who the hard drive should go to in the first instance: 
1. How many total devices are coming to us in this initial production? 
1. What are those devices — i.e., type of device and which ones, from the spreadsheets you've sent? 
2. What's the total volume of data coming in this round of production? 
Once we know that, I can let the agents know where the drive needs to go in the first instance.

You are getting both NY and USVI. The biggest stumbling block are the newer Mac items that are in APFS 
(there are a bunch from the Island,) so it is difficult to estimate how long those will take until I see how many 
items I have to export.

I am in the process of exporting the materials (documents, spreadsheets, emails, etc) for your review as per my 
discussions with 
. Most of the NY stuff is done, just Mac items left. This might take a few days as 1 item in 
particular has over 500,000 emails. We will be able to provide discovery once Defense Council has provided 
drives for us to copy items over to. This goes quicker as there is no processing involved. I'll let you know when 
everything is complete.

Also, the related critical question that I don't think we have clarity on is whether you're giving us a copy of everything that

We are going every other day now, ramping up to 75% week after next. I need drives to put things on like

Wanted to circle back on this and check in, particularly because we desperately need to get the results from the July and 
September searches before moving forward with possible additional charges in the case. I know you had mentioned you 
needed to push back your prior estimate of complete production by early June, by a couple weeks, so wanted to see what 
the current estimate is? I don't think we've started to get anything yet but please correct me if I'm wrong.

Unfortunately, recent events and our staffing levels have conspired to put a kink in just about everything. If we 
can't make heads or tails of the stuff I've already produced, we'll do it again. They have told us that our staffing 
levels will be steadily increasing over the next few weeks, but I'm going to have to push back my estimate by a 
week or 2. Sorry about that. My next day in the office is Thursday, so I'll be able to see if I can easily identify 
what I already gave you and many it to a reliable identifier.

Separately, to follow up on a question from the May 15 email below, the list has just five devices as still pending to be

And related to that question, are we still on track to get the full range of data in the next week or so? I don't think we've

Updated item descriptions. Just a side note, many thumb drives and SD cards will not have a serial number

Thanks for this, it's a helpful start. In terms of being able to write our search warrant, one additional piece of information 
we need is the serial number, or some other specific identifier, ideally for each device but at least for any device that there 
is more than one of the same thing. So for example, we need to be able to somehow differentiate the following devices — 
The two Dell power edge T310 hard drives (NYCO24323 and NYCO24324) 
The two Sony Vaio laptop / Fujitsu hdd (NYCO24336 and NYCO24337) 
EFTA00030399
--- PAGE 9 ---
the following loose storage devices: 
o Micro SD card (NYCO24339) 
o Flash Drive (generic) (NYCO24340) 
o Thumbdrive (Emtec) (NYCO24341) 
o hard drive (loose) (NYCO24342) 
o verbatim thumbdrive (NYCO24343) 
The four San Disk cruzer-thumbdrives (NYCO24344-47) 
The three Seagate IDE hard drives (NYCO24348-50) 
The camera SD card (NYCO24351) 
I think the rest of the devices are either specifically distinguishable and/or have an S/N listed. (By comparison, the USVI 
spreadsheet we have lists an s/n for about 20 of the 25(ish) devices. 
The other thing we're looking for is the location in the house (and ideally specific location) for each device, which the USVI 
list also has — is that info available? 
The list also has just five devices as still pending to be transferred to us, and I think it's right that the plan is to reproduce 
all the materials so that we can get them in searchable format, but just wanted to confirm? Currently, we aren't able to 
match any of the prior productions to specific devices — so if we're able to match them up by Bates number now, that

Here is The listing of all the evidence gathered in NY that I have. I added some columns to guide you to the 
unique numbers CART NY uses fro their evidence. The template wasn't a slam dunk over, so I did what I could to 
convey the information. If you are confused by anything, please let me know. In the column for approximate 
size, it is in GB, totaled at the bottom and converted to TB. In the materials contained column, I put what load 
file group the data was transferred over in (Mac, Windows, Loose Media, IDE, or Blacklight) If there is no entry 
in that column, that data has yet to be transferred. There are 2 Macs and a DVR you don't have as well as an 
iPhone and an iPad. IF the descriptions are a bit light, let me know and I'll do what I can to beef them up. I will 
get you the Island stuff tomorrow.

Respectfully, I think there are some miscommunications here — all we have asked is to receive the materials in a format 
such that we can view them using a system we have access to. We're not able to get web-enabled access through any FBI 
tool, so we asked for the materials to be transferred in a loadable format so we could put them on Relativity, which both 
we and the agents can access. We're required to have the files in a format that we can produce them to defense counsel. 
I've done that in many other cases and it hasn't previously been an issue. My understanding from 
is that the best 
way to do it now is just for us (the U.S. Attorney's Office) to get the original files, which our vendor will process—by which 
I just mean converting into file formats that are loadable onto Relativity. It doesn't really have anything to do with the 
taint review—we have to have access to the docs in our systems for discovery purposes. 
And we were happy to get the materials as they were processed, but when we received the 1.1 million documents earlier 
this year, they were in a format that wasn't usable for the reasons described in the email I sent on March 9. Again, I 
understand from 
that the best way forward is to just get copies of the materials in their original formats, which I 
understand will be segregated and designated by device. That should work for usl I was just trying to understand the 
approach, as well as the timeline. 
thanks,

Just to be clear. The US Attorney's Office (or it's contractors) are not "processing" anything. You are taking files 
that I will be extracting from processed evidence and putting them into an E-Discovery tool (Relativity) to do a 
taint review. 
Relativity is NOT a forensic tool. It is incapable of dealing with many things that are found forensically on a 
computer like free space, slack space, and system files to name a few. When we started this, and you insisted 
you do the taint review in Relativity, I warned you that it was adding months worth of work on top of what was 
already done, and that Relativity was incapable of viewing everything. You insisted we do it this way. So now 
and I have come up with a way to fit this round peg into this square hole. We will get it done. 
Sorry it has taken so long, but we are talking about terabytes worth of data over multiple forms of digital 
evidence. Phones, tablets, loose media, cameras, DVRs, servers, laptops, and desktop computers. We have 
gotten past encryption on multiple devices. When we review devices on such large cases, we usually do it piece 
by piece as things are processed, I was unaware that you didn't want to review as things were processed, that 
you wanted to do it "all at once", so that added to the delay. Sorry for that. Just a differentiation of 
methodology I suppose. 
EFTA00030401
--- PAGE 11 ---
and I feel confident that the method we have come up with will be more consistent and preserve the 
attribution of files to devices and links of e-mails to attachments that the load file generation that I did a while 
back was lacking.

Okay, so just to check, you both think that there is not a need to do a test run? You're both comfortable with just basically 
sending us copies of everything? I don't totally understand why we couldn't have done that eight months ago, but 
regardless of the passage of time, I want to make sure we understand so we can report to our supervisors. I assume that 
means that we (at the U.S. Attorney's Office and through contractors) will therefore need to do all the processing 
ourselves, correct? And thanks again to you both.

Understood, thanks—it will be great to get that list on Thursday. As a refresh, the info we are looking for is in the 
attached spreadsheet template. 
On the returns themselves, do the changes you mentioned mean that the estimate of a month from now for complete 
transmission of the search warrant returns is no longer likely? If so could you please let us know what the current 
estimate would be, so we can factor that in? Thanks very much.

Sony for the delay, they reduced us to 1 day a week, so things have been stretched out by a factor of 5. I will be

Following up on the below, I think you had said you expected to be able to get us a list of the devices seized from the

month (during our conference call a month ago) — so wanted to check if we can still expect that very soon? We're waiting 
on that list to be able to do an updated search warrant on all of those devices. Please let us know the current timeline —

Unfortunately I don't think this is very helpful to us. Did you take a look at the example spreadsheet I sent on 2/24? The 
excel file you sent has descriptions that don't match up to the items listed in the search warrant returns (that we sent on 
2/23), and we don't have the 1B or CART numbers to be able to cross-reference. We also can't tell what you mean by 
"loose media" without a specific comparison to what was seized, we don't know which items you're referring to as 
"Windows machines," and we can't tell whether the entirety of any particular item has been transferred, or just partial. 
For example, it looks like we have gotten very, very few image files, which is surprising. 
We have also encountered some very significant problems in trying to review the more than 1 million documents we 
recently received: 
The data we've received has no way to put any emails and attachments together. So if an email says, "see the 
attached flight records," for example, we have no way of linking that up with the records themselves. Not only is 
that a big problem for us in review, it's going to be a huge problem for producing the documents to defense 
counsel. 
The load file has no link to the native file, so when we load the data to the database, there's no way to have the 
native files show up in the database. Because many of the files are too large to open in the viewer, it effectively 
means that there are many files that are completely invisible to us. 
Related, the control numbers in the load file don't match up to the native files. So we have two sets of numbers 
and no way to match up anything—that is, even if we were to try to go hunt down every individual large file in the 
native files, it would be impossible. 
EFTA00030406
--- PAGE 16 ---
So the data that we most recently got, we need to get in a form that addresses those issues, and we likely will need to get 
a similar reproduction of the data we received a couple months ago. Otherwise we're sifting through more than a million 
documents without much rhyme or reason. 
I've re-attached the spreadsheet we sent last week — I think that's a good place to start in terms of our necessary record-
keeping, and we need that info at the very least, as well as anything else you think would be useful. Also attaching the SW 
returns for reference. And again, we're happy to meet up anytime and hash all this out in person if that's useful.

Here is a listing of what I have already handed over in load files to the US Attorney's Office for taint review. Some points of 
clarification: There were 9 IDE hard drives found in the Manhattan apartment, they turned out to be 3 copies of 3 drives 
(9 drives in total) from a July 2007 search on one of his properties. I only processed 3 (as they were all copies). All the 
loose media from the NY apartment is included. All the Windows machines from the NY apartment are included. Only 2 
Macs from NY and 1 from the Island are included. 
I will have to more closely coordinate with whoever is loading up Relativity with the remaining Macs as the tool 
they have to be processed with does not easily re-name the load files. 
Spreadsheet is attached.

Totally understand about the network issues—we can relate. I do still think it will be helpful to all sit down together to 
have an in-person discussion, to make sure everybody is on the same page. Are folks available for that next week? And 
what I think would be most helpful to facilitate that would be a spreadsheet of each separate device referenced in the two 
search warrant returns, with columns for whether we've dumped the contents, whether they've been reviewed and/or 
transferred, what portions were transferred, etc. 
Something roughly like the attached, with any other categories you think would be useful — and the info on the attached is 
mostly hypothetical, obviously, just as examples. That will help us fully understand what's been reviewed, transferred, 
and received so far, and what remains. 
(Also just on the pictures, we do want copies of those as well, please including from the discs and the devices — I think FBI 
was going to do an initial screen to make sure no CP, and since I think the answer was no, we'll need to get those to be 
able to review them as well.)

Sony for the delayed response. They are tearing out our old network and giving us a new one, they mandated we 
delete old stuff (about 400 TB worth). Now that they are working on replacing the network, we can do only local 
work. I should be able to give you an accounting of what is what. I can say, off the top of my head, that all 
windows based items from the NY search have been handed over as well as all loose media. The CDs from NY 
only contained pictures, no documents. There are still some Apple items from NY that need to be produced. As 
far as the Island stuff goes, the 1st item on your spreadsheet, the "kitchen" mac has been produced. Still working 
on the rest.

Following up on the below from last weekend, I'm still not sure how we're addressing this so I thought it would make 
sense for us to all schedule a (hopefully relatively brief) meeting to all get on the same page? We didn't hear back on 
which files had previously been provided, but our tech folks did their best to differentiate, and we got access to the 
materials yesterday and its well over a million documents, and we don't have any idea what we're looking at — i.e., which 
devices the materials came from, whether it's full or partial results, how many more devices we have coming, etc. 
Based on the attached search warrant returns, it looks like from the New York mansion (the PDF) there are approximately 
devices that would have storage (computers, hard drives, thumb drives, etc.) and that's not even counting at least 60+ 
CDs. And then from the Virgin Islands (the Excel spreadsheet), at least more than 25 devices, including multiple servers / 
server racks. 
So we gotta know what we've already received, what remains, anticipated schedule, etc, and I know it's a lot of moving 
pieces on all sides so wanted to loop in everybody at once. The case team will be in California this coming week from 
Tuesday through Friday, but then I think generally around the first week of March, which will hopefully be plenty of time 
to schedule a productive meeting.

I'm not sure who's the exact right person to ask this, so wanted to get everybody on one email chain about it — I have the 
hard drive that 
dropped off that has new Epstein search warrant materials, but it looks like there are also old 
materials (that I think we had previously received and uploaded??) on the hard drive, and so I'm not sure what's new. 
EFTA00030409
--- PAGE 19 ---
Just generally, and 
and I talked about this last week too, but it's basically impossible for us to keep track of what 
we're getting, and what has been completed, without some kind of identification or labeling system, along with a list of 
which devices have been extracted and downloaded. 
So for example on the hard drive currently, there are 38 folders labeled "loadFiles" through "37loadFiles" with a modified 
date of 11/14/19, which I think we may have already previously received — but I'm not sure, because we haven't gotten 
any info on which folders match up to which devices, etc. And then there's another folder titled "NYC024362" that has a 
modified date of 1/27/20, so I think that may be the materials we hadn't previously received? That folder by itself has 
more than 600,000 items. 
I don't want to give 
anything that we've already previously received and uploaded, and I can't tell from the folder or 
file names whether everything on the drive is new, or whether just additional materials were saved onto it in addition to 
what we already have. =, 
are you able to give us some guidance on this? Ultimately what we really need is a 
spreadsheet of every device, whether it's been dumped (or partially dumped), and then identifying that same info —
which device, and what materials from it — are being given to us with each data transfer. Otherwise I think 
organizationally and for review purposes it will be a total disaster for us. 
We're happy to have a meeting on this if that's helpful — and thanks everybody for the assistance.

Thanks again for speaking with us earlier. I spoke with MDC legal, and they're fine with our proposal. They said they could 
submit a letter to the Court by Friday. We'll let you know how our conversation with defense counsel goes—we haven't 
scheduled a call with them just yet. 
Thanks,

In particular, there appears to be a track change that is included in 
the second page, which we are hoping you could fix before we submit this 
to Judge Nathan. 
We also were hoping to chat about some other issues, but even if that's 
not possible, we're hoping we can provide the court with a clean copy

accompanying cover letters are attached. Would you please make sure 
Maxwell is given access to this drive? 
Would you please mail the broken drive back to our office? It can be

Sorry but I don't believe this voucher is accurate, similar to the prior one. First, it appears to allocate one night of the 
hotel to the travel card, which is incorrect—the entirety of the hotel was paid on my personal card (please see attached 
email and I'm again sending the hotel invoice). Additionally, it doesn't appear to include the hotel tax of $ 70.12, which I 
also paid on my personal credit card. 
Please let me know when it's corrected and I'll review again. Thanks.

2) 11/13, taxi from airport to hotel, $ 56.46 (taxi, personal credit card)

I understand you're supposed to be filing a response today (by 5:00?) to a defense motion to have Maxwell 
released to the general population at MDC, or at least to be detained under conditions they say would allow her 
greater access to a computer and the opportunity to review discovery materials? Main (OPA) is keenly interested 
because of the AG's response last summer to Epstein's suicide and his bow to overhaul BOP and ensure inmate 
safety, so a guy down there asked if we could send him what you file as soon as you do. (Apparently the AG is 
getting questions from Congressional Republicans about what's being done to ensure Maxwell's safety.)

Independent 
Epstein Victims' Compensation Program 
PROTOCOL 
DRAFT1
December 13, 2019 
I. 
Purpose and Overview 
The Epstein Victims' Compensation Program (the "Program") is a voluntary, independent Program that 
has been established to compensate and resolve the claims of victims/survivors of sexual abuse by Jeffrey 
Epstein ("Epstein"). 
The Estate of Jeffrey Epstein (the "Estate") has retained the services of nationally recognized claims 
administration experts Kenneth R. Feinberg, Camille S. Biros and Jordana H. Feldman to design the 
Program. Ms. Feldman will also serve as the Administrator of the Program (the "Administrator"). 
Through the Program, the Estate wishes to acknowledge the wrongs endured by victims/survivors and 
offer them an opportunity to voluntarily resolve their individual claims for such sexual abuse. 
The Program is governed by the following non-exclusive guiding principles: 
• The Program is purely voluntary. It does not affect any rights a victim may have 
unless and until the Claimant accepts the offered compensation and executes a 
Release. A Claimant may reject the offer of compensation and may stop participating 
in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time prior to execution of the Release. 
• The Program is independent and will in no way be administered, controlled or 
overseen by the Estate. The Administrator is responsible for all decisions relating to 
the review, processing and evaluation of individual claims submitted to the Program. 
The Administrator will have final, binding and exclusive authority to determine 
Claimant eligibility and the valuation of each eligible individual claim. Decisions of 
the Administrator made pursuant to this Protocol are not subject to review or 
modification in any way by the Estate or any other party or entity. 
• 
There is no cap or limitation on the aggregate amount of funds available to 
compensate all eligible Claimants or on the amount of compensation to be made to 
each individual Claimant. Each individual claim will be evaluated separately by the 
Administrator. The Administrator will determine, in her sole and exclusive discretion, 
issues of eligibility and the amount of compensation. 
' This document is a draft of the Protocol governing the Program and is subject to input from victims/survivors, their lawyers, 
other potentially interested parties, and representatives of the Estate. 
Wage 
EFTA00030441
--- PAGE 2 ---
• All Claimants will be treated with respect, dignity and fairness without regard to race, 
color, sexual orientation, national origin, religion, gender or disability. To ensure 
claims will be adjudicated fairly, the Administrator will manage the process so that 
all Claimants can equally access the Program's claim process. Individuals with 
disabilities will be given the opportunity to effectively communicate their claims and 
to request special process accommodations. 
The Program will be effective within 90 days of approval by the Superior Court of the U.S. Virgin Islands 
("Effective Date")2 and is available to all victims/survivors regardless of where they were harmed, when 
they were harmed, whether the claim is time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations, and whether 
they have previously filed a lawsuit against or settled with Epstein and/or the Estate. 
The exclusive claims period for filing a claim pursuant to this Protocol shall commence on the to-be-
determined Effective Date and shall conclude nine (9) months after that date ("Filing Deadline"). All 
individual claims filed with the Program must be postmarked within this period. 
II. 
Eligibility Requirements 
A. Eligibility Criteria 
The persons eligible to participate in this Program are individuals who allege they were sexually abused 
by Epstein. In addition, the following criteria apply: 
• 
The claim of sexual abuse must be directed against Epstein. 
• 
An individual whose claim is time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations may participate 
in the Program provided that other eligibility criteria are met. 
• 
An individual who previously entered into a settlement agreement resolving a claim of sexual 
abuse against Epstein may participate in the Program provided that other eligibility criteria are 
met. 
• 
An individual who allegedly assisted Epstein in procuring other victims/survivors may participate 
in the Program where there is a credible basis to determine that the individual acted under 
duress as a result of her own sexual abuse by Epstein, provided that other eligibility criteria are 
met. 
• 
If the Claimant chooses to accept the offered compensation, the Claimant must dismiss with 
prejudice any existing lawsuits or legal actions or claims filed against the Estate or related entities 
and/or individuals. The Claimant must provide proof of such dismissal along with or prior to the 
signed acceptance letter and executed Release in order to receive payment. 
The final version of the Protocol will include dates certain identifying the commencement date of the Program and 
registration and filing deadlines, as explained below. 
Wage 
EFTA00030442
--- PAGE 3 ---
B. Legal Representatives of Claimants 
An individual may file a claim on a victim's behalf where that individual has been granted legal authority 
to act in a representative capacity pursuant to appropriate law. The "Legal Representative" of an 
individual Claimant shall mean: (1) in the case of a Claimant who is currently a minor, a parent or legal 
guardian authorized by law to serve as the minor's legal representative; (2) in the case of an incompetent 
or legally incapacitated Claimant, a person who has been duly appointed as the Claimant's legal 
representative in accordance with applicable law; or (3) an attorney authorized to represent the Claimant 
for purposes of pursuing a claim through this Program. 
Legal Representatives must provide proper documentation demonstrating representative capacity. Such 
proof may include a power of attorney, documentation showing the individual's appointment as guardian 
or guardian ad litem, or a copy of a retainer agreement showing legal representation signed by both the 
Claimant and the attorney. 
Claims Administration - Submission, Evaluation and Determination 
A. Claims Submission Process 
Individuals who have filed a lawsuit, legal action or claim against Epstein and/or the Estate on or before 
the Effective Date will be sent a Claim Form and other relevant Program information, including 
Instructions for completion and submission of the Claim Form and a list of Frequently Asked Questions. 
Individuals who have not filed a lawsuit, legal action or claim against Epstein and/or the Estate on or 
before the Effective Date may register to participate in this Program on the Program's website at 
www.EpsteinVictimsCompensationProgram.com.3 To register, such individuals must complete a 
questionnaire setting forth their name, contact information, a summary description of the nature of the 
claim and other requested information. Upon registration, the Administrator will perform a preliminary 
review to consider if the individual is eligible to participate in the Program. If the Administrator deems 
that the individual is eligible to participate in the Program, she will then send that individual a Claim Form 
and other relevant Program information. 
Note: The fact that an individual is sent a Claim Form and other relevant Program information indicates 
that the Administrator has determined that such individual is eligible to participate in the Program. It 
does not indicate that the Administrator has determined that such individual is eligible to receive 
compensation. That determination is made only after a Claim Form and all required documentation has 
been submitted and evaluated by the Administrator. 
Registrations will be accepted by the Administrator from the Effective Date through a date that is 45 days 
prior to the Filing Deadline ("Registration Deadline"). It is important to note that the Registration Deadline 
is separate from, and precedes, the Filing Deadline. As explained above, all claims must be filed by the 
Filing Deadline. 
This website is in the process of being developed and is yet operational. 
Wage 
EFTA00030443
--- PAGE 4 ---
All Claim Forms must be completed and postmarked no later than the Filing Deadline. Claim Forms 
should be mailed via overnight courier (a pre-paid courier voucher will be included with each packet) to 
the Administrator at 
the following address 
or uploaded to the Program 
website at 
www.EosteinVictimsCompensationProgram.com:
Epstein Victims' Compensation Program 
Jordana H. Feldman, Administrator 
[Address - To Be Inserted] 
Claimants are invited to provide documentation identified in the Claim Form, and any other corroborating 
or supporting information sufficient to substantiate the claim, satisfy eligibility requirements, and allow 
the Administrator to review, process and evaluate the claim. If the claim is being presented by a Legal 
Representative, then the Legal Representative will be responsible for submitting the necessary 
documentation relating to the represented Claimant. 
Additional documentation may be requested at the discretion of the Administrator. Both the Claimant 
and the Estate will be afforded the opportunity to submit to the Administrator any information deemed 
relevant to the Administrator's evaluation and determination of the claim before the Administrator's final 
disposition of the claim. 
If a Claimant submits an incomplete or deficient claim, the Administrator will notify the Claimant, explain 
the additional information that is needed, and work with the Claimant or the Claimant's Legal 
Representative (where applicable) to assist in submitting a complete claim. 
B. Claims Evaluation and Determination 
Claims will be evaluated in the order in which they are received, with the Administrator evaluating each 
submitted individual claim in a prompt and fair manner. Claims will only be determined once all required 
documentation has been submitted to the Administrator 
1. Factors Considered in Evaluating Claims 
As to each individual claim, the Administrator will determine, in her sole discretion based upon all of the 
information available, whether the allegations of sexual abuse are credible. The Administrator will 
consider appropriate factors and corroborative support, including but not limited to: 
• 
The level of documentation, corroboration or other circumstantial evidence regarding the nature 
and extent of the abuse, the frequency, location and other details of the abuse, and the age of 
the victim at the time of the abuse. Non-exhaustive examples of such evidence include (i) 
medical 
or 
psychiatric 
counseling/therapy 
records 
relevant 
to 
the 
abuse, 
and 
(ii) contemporaneous written notification or other correspondence (e.g., letters, emails) of the 
abuse by the Claimant to law enforcement authorities, parents, friends or others. 
• 
Whether there exists any information and/or pertinent findings offered by the appropriate 
Office of the District Attorney or other law enforcement agency. 
4IPage 
EFTA00030444
--- PAGE 5 ---
• 
Whether the Administrator finds the claims of the individual to be credible after complete review 
of all relevant documentation and other evidence provided by the Claimant and the Estate. 
As to each individual claim, the Administrator will determine, in her sole discretion based upon all of the 
information available, the amount of compensation that should be offered to each eligible Claimant. The 
Administrator will consider appropriate factors and corroborative support, including but not limited to: 
• The nature, duration and extent of the sexual abuse suffered by the Claimant. 
• The age of the Claimant at the time of the sexual abuse. 
• The nature and extent of the Claimant's physical or psychological damage resulting from the 
sexual abuse, and the effect of the sexual abuse on the Claimant. 
• The credibility of the claim based upon all of the facts and circumstances, supporting 
documentation and corroborating evidence. 
• Whether the claim is time-barred under the applicable statute of limitations. 
• Whether the Claimant previously entered into a settlement agreement with Epstein and received 
a payment pursuant to such agreement. 
The Administrator will confidentially send the Claimant a compensation determination letter including the 
following: (1) the Administrator's eligibility decision regarding the claim; (2) the amount of compensation 
offered; (3) a Release to be signed by the Claimant if the Claimant accepts the offered compensation; and 
(4) a Payment Option Form. The Administrator's offer shall be valid for 60 days from the date of the 
compensation determination letter. 
The Administrator's determinations in this Program will not be binding on any potential criminal 
investigation involving the same or similar allegations or Claimant. 
2. Opportunities to be Heard 
The Claimant will be afforded an opportunity to be heard, either before or after the Administrator renders 
her determination. Upon request by the Claimant, the Administrator will be available to meet in person, 
by video conference/Skype, or by teleconference to further discuss the claim. These meetings are 
completely optional and voluntary. Requests to meet with the Administrator should be sent by email 
claimantservices@epsteinvictimscompensationprogram.com4 and will be scheduled at a mutually 
convenient time and location. The Administrator may also request a meeting with a Claimant or her Legal 
Representative at a reasonable mutually convenient time and location, though the Claimant is not 
obligated to attend any such meeting. 
This email address is not yet active. 
5IPage 
EFTA00030445
--- PAGE 6 ---
3. Release 
By submitting a claim to the Program, a Claimant is seeking to resolve all claims relating to allegations of 
sexual abuse against Epstein and/or the Estate, related entities and/or individuals. If a Claimant chooses 
to accept the offer of compensation pursuant to the Program, the Claimant will be required to sign and 
execute a full Release, in a form satisfactory to the Estate, of all past and future claims relating to such 
allegations of sexual abuse against the Estate, related entities and/or individuals. A Claimant may reject 
the offer of compensation and may stop participating in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time 
prior to the execution of the Release. 
The Release will waive any rights the Claimant and her heirs, descendants, legatees or beneficiaries 
may have to assert any claims relating to allegations of sexual abuse against the Estate, related entities 
and/or individuals, to file an individual legal action relating to such allegations, or to participate in any 
legal action associated with such allegations, except as a witness. However, the Release will not 
operate to preclude or limit the Claimant's ability to report and discuss allegations of sexual abuse with 
law enforcement officials or anyone else. 
Before signing a Release, the Claimant must consult with an attorney. If the Claimant is not represented 
by an attorney, the Program will provide an attorney to provide free legal counseling to the Claimant 
for the sole purpose of advising the Claimant concerning the language and binding nature of the 
Release. 
No one affiliated with the Program will provide tax or legal advice to those receiving payments under 
the Program. Claimants are urged to consult with a tax advisor concerning any questions regarding tax 
liability for payments pursuant to the Program. 
4. Payments 
Upon the Claimant's acceptance of the Administrator's determination, the Administrator's receipt of 
the Claimant's executed Release and, where applicable, dismissal with prejudice of any existing lawsuit 
or legal actions or claims against the Estate or related entities and/or individuals, the Administrator will 
initiate payment by check or electronic funds transfer to each eligible Claimant as directed by the 
Claimant. Checks will be sent to Claimants via overnight courier service. 
C. Program Integrity 
For the purpose of protecting both the integrity of the Program and financial resources for eligible 
Claimants, the Administrator will institute all necessary measures to prevent payment of fraudulent 
claims, including taking steps to verify claims and analyze submissions for inconsistencies, irregularities 
or duplication. 
6IPage 
EFTA00030446
--- PAGE 7 ---
Each Claimant who signs the Claim Form at the time of submission certifies that the information provided 
in the Claim Form is true and accurate to the best of the Claimant's knowledge, and that the Claimant 
understands that false statements or claims made in connection with such submission may result in fines, 
imprisonment and/or any other remedy available by law. Claims that appear to be potentially fraudulent 
or to contain false information will be forwarded to federal, state or local law enforcement agencies 
and/or the appropriate Office of the District Attorney for possible investigation and prosecution. 
D. Confidentiality/Privacy 
The Program is confidential. By filing a claim with the Program, the Claimant or her Legal 
Representative (where applicable) agrees that information submitted by the Claimant pursuant to the 
Program will be used and/or disclosed by the Administrator and her designees only for the following 
purposes: 
I) Processing and evaluating the Claimant's claim; 
2) Administering the Program and other Program-related work; and 
3) Reports to law enforcement where appropriate. 
When documents maintained or submitted by the Estate become part of a Claimant's file for purposes 
of the Program, such materials will be reviewed by the Administrator to assist in processing and 
evaluating the claim, but will otherwise remain confidential. These files are not available for inspection, 
review or copying by the Claimant or her representatives during or after the Program, and all pertinent 
settlement privileges and other privileges apply. 
To protect the privacy of Claimants participating in the Program, all personal information provided by 
the Claimant during this process will be returned or destroyed within one year after the conclusion of 
the Program. 
Individual Claimants are not bound by any rules of confidentiality. Claimants may, at their sole and 
voluntary option, disclose information in their possession regarding their claim, their compensation and 
their experience with the Program. 
All confidentiality requirements are subject to law, regulation and judicial process. 
The Administrator may, on a periodic basis, publish reports regarding the Program's claims processing or 
other activities in an effort to provide transparency. Such reports will report on an aggregate level only. 
No individual Claimant information will be published or disclosed in a way that compromises Claimant 
confidentiality.

Okay M, I know the issue. The TDY needs to be changed to Santa Monica, CA instead of Los Angeles, CA since you're 
actually staying in a hotel that's in Santa Monica, CA, which has a per diem of $248. Los Angeles, CA has a per diem of 
$181 only. I'll make the amendments and resend your Travel Authorization to Budget ASAP.

attorney-client privilege; 
(b)(6) - concerns material the release of which would constitute a clearly 
unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of third parties; 
(b)(7)(A) - concerns records or information compiled for law enforcement 
purposes the release of which could reasonably be expected to interfere with 
enforcement proceedings; 
(b)(7)(B) - concerns records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes the 
release of which would deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial 
adjudication 
(b)(7)(C) - concerns records or information compiled for law enforcement

Here are a few more things from your request. I have been unable to locate any watch calls or SROs from the requested 
time frame. I will continue to look for those documents. I have been told SROs were likely not completed during that time 
and also that most of the Control Center paperwork (originals), to include watch call sheets, were seized by the FBI and/or 
OIG shortly after the incident, and therefore are no longer in the institution. 
Please let me know if you have any questions or if I can be of any further assistance.

the purpose of ascertaining what hard-copy materials they still have related to the case down there and how we could

MI— Hope all is well. We had spoken last summer, after the Epstein case was charged, about some potential 
document/discovery requests related to the SDFL investigation and the NPA, in particular. Those conversations were 
largely at mooted at the time by Epstein's death, but as I'm sure you know, we've recently charged Ghislaine Maxwell and, 
anticipating potentially similar issues, we were hoping to revisit those conversations. Do you have time later this week 
for a quick call? If so, please let us know what might work for you.

Subject: Questions re Maxwell 
I just got a call froa 
and we discussed a number of issues regarding Maxwell. The two issues I wanted to follow up 
with you about are below: 
• 
Maxwell is reporting that a staff member named 
o.
 was part of the group that included a 
COVID positive individual but-is 
still working at the MDC. Would you please check on that for 
me? 
• 
Maxwell reported that a staff member entered her cell while she was inside it and took photographs of her cell 
today. Anything you can share with me about the purpose of that? 
More generall 
indicated that she believes Maxwell's mental health is deteriorating significantly because of the 
constant survei ance she is experiencing. She reports being awoken in the night by a light shining into her eyes multiple 
times a night, being searched more frequently than other inmates, and having a camera constantly pointed at her in a way 
that other inmates do not experience. Our office of course defers to BOP on decisions regarding what is necessary for 
safety and security, but I wanted to pass along the concern.

All, 
I hope my responses below serve to clear up some of the issues you had with the documentation that was provided. I 
continue to work to obtain the missing items and will send them as I receive any additional documents. Please let me 
know if you have further questions and I'll be happy to address anything that is still unclear. 
Many of the requests made, such as ICT agenda, cellmate policies and SHU policies are not one-stop-shops. 
These issues are covered in a number of different policies, therefore I tried to include all policies that 
reference those topics. 
1. We received unsigned Word versions of Program Statements 5511.08 and 5500.13. Are there finalized versions? 
Executive Assistant Lee Plourde handles the finalizing of the supplements. He's on leave and will 
address this upon his return on Monday, June 29, 2020. 
2. Why were we given the BOP Correctional Services Procedures Manual? Which of our requests is this responsive 
to? Section 310 of this policy covers inmate accountability in the SHU. You requested 5511.08 and 
this section in the CSPM overlaps some of those same policies. 
3. Why were we given the BOP Suicide Prevention Program Statement? Which of our requests is this responsive to? 
This policy covers staff training requirements for ICT and Quarterly SHU training. I included the 
policy because it directly correlated with other requests. 
4. We were also given a Powerpoint entitled Suicide Prevention for Inmates. Which of our requests is this responsive 
to? When is this document from? The slide show is the Psychology portion of the SHU Training you 
requested. It is dated 1/2/2014. I have requested an updated version that would have been used 
more closely to the time of 
assignment to SHU. I'm just waiting for Psychology staff to 
provide me whatever it is they used at that time. 
5. We were provided a document titled Introduction to Correctional Techniques from January 2020. Which of our 
requests is this responsive to? Is it the MCC institutional familiarization training outline? If so, we would request 
EFTA00030500
--- PAGE 2 ---
one from a time when the defendants were actively employed at MCC (so before August 2019). This is the 
Institutional Familiarization (IF) outline you requested. It hasn't been called IF for a few years. It 
is now Introduction to Correctional Techniques (ICT). An earlier version is attached here. 
6. We were provided with an undated slide presentation about the MCC SHU. Which of our requests is this 
responsive to? When is this document from? The slide show was created 1/2/2014 as a part of 
quarterly SHU training. The quarterly SHU training is primarily conducted through the BOP's online 
training platform that is a self-guided course that covers a number of topics related to SHU. The 
official SHU training course is not something I can send or save due to the nature of the course 
being automated by the training platform and not a hard file. 
7. The BOP Code of Ethics is highlighted below. Which document is this? Program Statement 3420.11 is the 
Standards of Employee Conduct, which covers the dos and don'ts of employment in the BOP. I've 
attached the DO] Ethics Handbook here. If there is something specific you're looking for, please let 
me know. 
8. We received digital lieutenant's logs. Is there also a hard copy book? There is no hard copy book of these 
logs. The logs are saved to a shared folder at the end of each shift. Although I have worked at 
places that print each log, the Lieutenant's here at NYM reported that that is not the practice here. 
The LTs here email their logs to the executive staff at the conclusion of each 24 hour period for 
review purposes. Thus, eliminating a hard copy record system. 
9. We were provided with a document called "SHU Logs MW" and a document called "SHU Logs." Can we confirm 
what these are? Our requests were for SHU Watch Call Logs and SHU Control Center Logs. Those are the 
digital log books from SHU for the Evening and Morning Watch shifts during the requested time 
period. I am working on obtaining the actual Watch Call tracking sheets from the main Control 
Center at MCC which is something different. However, the officer should be logging their watch 
calls into the digital log book every 30 minutes between 6a — 6p each day. 
10. Which document contains the BOP and MCC policy on SHU quarterly training, which is highlighted below as 
having been provided? PS 5270.11 as well as the Suicide Prevention policy covers the SHU quarterly 
training requirement. There is not a separate policy for that. 
11. We asked for P.S. 5270.10, but got P.S. 5270.11. Was P.S. 5270.10 provided to us in error? Or was our request 
incorrect? 5270.10 does not exist. 5270.11 is the policy covering SHU. 
12. Which document contains the BOP and MCC policy on cellmates? I am not aware of any such policy and 
have struggled to find even a mention of it in the policies I've reviewed. I will continue to search 
for a policy that references cellmate assignments. 
13. In the second email, there is a document called "Hot Lists" dated August 30, 2019. Which of our requests is this 
responsive to? The "Hot List" is the high risk list. Any inmate on that list who goes to SHU requires 
immediate notification to Psychology. This is the only "high risk" list the BOP has and I provided it 
in response to you.uest for "All High Risk Lists reviewed during weekly SHU meetings..." 
14. In the second email, 
mentioned that most of the control center paperwork was seized by FBI and/or 01G. 
Do you or FBI have that paperwork? Has it been provided to us? 
15. Finally, what is the status of the remaining requests? As I continue to work from home, I have not 
personally been able to physically search for the Watch Call sheets. As I previously mentioned, 
those logs were reportedly seized early on in this investigation. I continue to follow up on this. 
With regard to the SROs, those reviews are only electronically available for inmates who are 
currently in SHU and only for the period of their most recent admission to SHU. SROs, assuming 
they were completed, would then be printed and filed in the inmate's central file. I am currently 
trying to figure out where Epstein's file is to see if any SROs are in it. If you really want ALL SROs 
for the period of 
assignment to SHU, that will be an extremely lengthy process of tracking 
down inmate files, many of whom have released from the BOP or been transferred to any number 
of institutions across the country, and then requesting any SROs from the specified period of time 
that are contained in those files be scanned to us. I'm guessing Epstein's file was taken along with 
all of the other documentation shortly after his death, but I have not confirmed that yet.

I know this is a sensitive subject with the team, but do you think we have enough in the indictment to support the 
interstate travel component necessary to both sets of charges? We certainly allege that the victims were abused in 
multiple states which give rise to an inference of travel, but in terms of the enticing/causing to travel, this is about all we 
have: 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, and Jeffrey Epstein enticed and caused minor 
victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, which MAXWELL knew 
and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
That is probably sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss, but do you think it is worth pushing the team to try to add 
more?

Do you want to review those? Or should they go straight to Audrey? I confess, most of the ones we have done historically 
have been MC related, so they went straight to Audrey, but this one is on Epstein, so if you'd like to see first, let me know.

Thanks for letting us know about the possible meeting location change— please let us know once you've been able to

know so that she can cancel the car service. 
Regarding the court conference, we are unfortunately not able to reserve seats for anyone—the court manages court 
security and the crowd, so we don't have control over that. The other victim attorneys have been attending the 
conferences on their own, and although I don't know, I would guess that means that they have been arriving early.

Thank you very much for this information. I plan to attend this court this status conference on Wednesday. I am 
concerned that the courtroom may be full and no seat will be available for me . Would you be kind enough to have 
someone on your staff save a seat for me? Also, since the courthouse is very close to your office I have emailed 
to 
ask if she would be willing to meet at your office instead of at my hotel at 1P.M.Since her hotel is near to your office and 
near the courthouse and since I will be in the area now as well , if she feels comfortable meeting at your office instead of 
my hotel I am willing to meet at your office to save you and her the time to travel to my hotel. I will let you know when 
she responds.

Some ofJeffrey Epstein's victims don't want new 
charges in South Florida 
Is‘ Marc Freeman 
mil. III FLORIDA SUN SL: I INLL 
JUL 30. 2019 1 2:34 PM 
After the recent arrest of financier Jeffrey Epstein in New York on federal sex trafficking charges, a number 
of his victims want more. They want him to be prosecuted in South Florida as well. 
But according to federal prosecutors, some of the minor girls he abused at his Palm Beach mansion before 2008 
do not want to see him face new criminal counts here. And those government lawyers say they fully support that 
position.

The debate about prosecuting Epstein in South Florida will be resolved soon enough. A federal judge in West 
Palm Beach is considering whether to strike down parts of Epstein's controversial 2007 deal that gave him and 
unnamed co-conspirators immunity from federal charges. 
U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra ruled in February that Epstein's non-prosecution agreement 
violated the federal Crime Victims' Rights Act. Dozens of victims were improperly kept in the dark 
about it until after it had been finalized. 
Marra ust decide how to rectify this violation 12 years later, after receiving arguments from lawyers for 
two of Epstein's victims, prosecutors and Epstein. 
The victims in the case, cited as Jane Does, say the necessary remedy is for Epstein to face what they say are 
long overdue charges in Florida. 
EFTA00030511
--- PAGE 2 ---
"To be sure, Jane Doe 1 and 2 very much appreciate the laudable efforts of the diligent prosecutors in New 
York," their lawyers wrote. "But those New York charges, important though they are, still leave Epstein's crimes 
in Florida uncharged and all of his co-conspirators at large." 
Attorney Spencer Kuvin of West Palm Beach said he represents one victim who met with the U.S. Attorney's 
Office in April. 
"She said she'd like to see him prosecuted and put in jail," Kuvin said. "She said, `I don't know if that's a 
realistic possibility, but that's what I want.'" 
He said it's not surprising that other victims are less inclined to participate. 
"When you have so many victims, you're going to have just as many different opinions as to how it should be 
handled," Kuvin said. "But that shouldn't stop the prosecution of a predator. One victim that wants to come 
forward ... is enough to put him away." 
The federal prosecutors explained that while some victims "would like to see Epstein prosecuted for his crimes, 
they valued anonymity above all and were not willing to speak with law enforcement or otherwise participate in 
any criminal or civil litigation due to the risk that their involvement may become known to family, friends, or the 
public." 
This is not to say there aren't many victims who are eager to see Epstein face new charges in South Florida, 
wrote Byung J. Pak, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia, and Jill E. Steinberg and Nathan P. 
Kitchens, special attorneys for the Southern District of Florida. 
[Popular on SunSentinel.com]  Batter up: Here's the 2020 South Florida Fair's theme » 
But they conclude that reopening their cases against Epstein in South Florida still "exacerbates the harm to 
victims who have attempted to readjust their lives in the interim." 
Kuvin said he agrees, "It's a valid concern for some of the victims." 
Attorneys for two victims in the pending Crime Victims' Right Act litigation blasted the government's reasoning 
to leave Epstein's non-prosecution agreement in place. 
Lawyers Bradley Edwards, Paul Cassell and Jack Scarola say any South Florida victims who are not willing to 
prosecute Epstein because of privacy concerns can simply decline to do so and remain anonymous. 
The lawyers say there's no way that prosecuting Epstein for some victims would harm other victims unless the 
prosecutors somehow disclose their identities in the process. 
"The Government's argument thus boils down to a stop-us-before-we-do-something-bad claim that deserves no 
credence from the Court," wrote Edwards and his co-counsel on behalf of the two women, identified as Jane Doe 
I and Jane Doe 2.

--- PAGE 3 ---
They also pointed out that the prosecutors weren't asserting the alleged "risk" to some victims outweighs 
obtaining justice for their clients. 
"But in any event, on closer examination, the Government's argument turns out to be vaporous," they wrote this 
month. 
Epstein's lawyers told the judge they support the South Florida prosecutors' arguments that the once-secret deal 
shouldn't be blown up to allow new charges.

Jeff and George, 
Thank you both very much for your assistance in response to our subpoenas seeking records from Interlochen. In 
reviewing the documents you produced in response to the attached subpoena, a follow-up question arose. Would you 
please confirm that your production included all records of any tuition payments that Epstein (or his entities) made for 
any students at Interlochen? 
Our team is also happy to discuss this inquiry over the phone if that would be useful. I am starting a trial tomorrow and 
will have limited availability this week, but my colleagues

I have another search request for the Maxwell case, please. If there's any way to get these searches run before you're off 
tomorrow, I'd be very grateful. 
We need the following search terms run on all of the non-privileged files contained in the three folders entitled 
"NYC024328", "NYC024349", and "NYC024350" in the "US v Epstein (SW Returns)" database on Relativity: 
• Please run the search terms listed in the attached Word document entitled "Epstein Responsiveness Search Terms". 
Please tag all hits with a tag entitled "Potentially Responsive". I believe you modified these search terms when 
running them on a larger data set in the same database. Please feel free to use those modified terms on this 
search as well if that is easier. 
• For all of the email addresses listed in the attached Word document entitled "Epstein Responsiveness Email 
Addresses," please pull any email with any of those addresses in the header (TO, FROM, CC, or 8CC). Please tag all 
of those emails with the same tag entitled "Potentially Responsive". 
Please let me know when these searches are complete, so that I can review the Potentially Responsive hits. Once we have 
reviewed, we will let you know what should be produced from that database. 
Thanks very much,

Hi 
I hope you're doing well. Because of some discovery accessibility issues we're having in the Ghislaine Maxwell case, we 
would like to provide a clean laptop to Maxwell in MDC for discovery review purposes. The laptop need only permit 
review of standard files — word, pdf, .tif, .xls, etc. All other capabilities and programs can be disabled. I understand we 
did something similar in the Avenatti case, and I= like to do the same here. Would that be possible? It would be a 
huge help to us if you could possibly prep and provide us with a laptop for this purpose. 
Thanks so much—

I'm one of the federal prosecutors 
handling the case of United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, which is scheduled to go to trial on July 12, 
2021 in the Southern District of New York. We would be interested in speaking with you about your 
availability to testify as an expert witness at trial. Are you available for a call tomorrow or next week to 
discuss? 
Thanks

If you wish to inspect any of the physical evidence referenced in these materials, including 
items listed on search inventories, please let us know, and we will make arrangements for you to 
do so. 
The defendant also made oral statements when he was arrested on or about July 6, 2019. 
Notes memorializing those statements are included in this production and are marked with control 
number USAO 002273. 
The Government recognizes its obligations under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), 
and its progeny. Pursuant to those obligations, we are disclosing the information below. This 
disclosure should not be taken to indicate that the Government believes the enclosed information 
constitutes Brady material. 
Rather, we make this disclosure in an abundance of caution. 
Specifically, the Government discloses the following: 
• 
The victim identified in the Indictment as "Victim-1" received a grand jury subpoena 
from the Southern District of Florida ("SDFL") in or about 2008. However, Victim-1 
was never interviewed by law enforcement, including the West Palm Beach Police 
Department, Federal Bureau of investigation ("FBI"), or SDFL in connection with their 
investigation, and Victim-1 did not testify before the grand jury in SDFL. Victim-1 was 
first interviewed by law enforcement regarding the defendant in or about 2019, after FBI 
agents from the New York Field Office working with this Office approached Victim-1. 
The victims identified in the Indictment as "Victim-2" and "Victim-3" were both 
interviewed by law enforcement in connection with the SDFL investigation on multiple 
occasions between in or around 2006 and in or around 2008. Victim-2 and Vicitm-3 
were both identified as victims in the July 10, 2008 letter from SDFL to counsel for the 
defendant. Victim-1 was not included on that list. Please note that all three of these 
victims are currently represented by counsel. 
• 
During an interview with FBI agents in West Palm Beach, Florida in or around 2007, the 
victim identified in the Indictment as "Victim-2" stated that during her first contact with 
the defendant, she told the defendant that she had just turned eighteen, when in fact she 
was younger than eighteen at the time. In subsequent interviews, Victim-2 has told law 
enforcement that the first time she met the defendant, she told him that she was 16, when 
in fact she was younger than sixteen. Victim-2 further stated that she brought other 
victims to the defendant's residence for sexualized massages. She initially told these 
victims that they should tell the defendant that they were older than they in fact were. 
Over time, however, Victim-2 stopped telling other victims this because she came to 
understand that the defendant had a specific preference for underage girls. 
• 
During the Palm Beach Police Department's investigation of the defendant in 2005, a 
witness ("Witness-1") disclosed to detectives that the defendant had paid Witness-1 to 
bring girls for sexualized massages, and that the defendant told her: "the younger the 
better." Witness-1 described bringing multiple girls who were under the age of eighteen 
to the defendant's residence in Florida. Witness-1 recalled bringing a girl who was over 
eighteen, and that the defendant told Witness-1 that this girl was too old. Witness-1 
06.20.2018 
EFTA00030534
--- PAGE 4 ---
Page 4 
remarked of the defendant: "He likes the girls that are between the ages of 18 and 20." 
Please note that Witness-1 is also represented by counsel, Rita Glavin, 
The Government will provide material under Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 154 
(1972), and its progeny, in a timely manner prior to trial and consistent with the schedule agreed 
upon by the parties or set by the Court. 
Disclosure by the Defendant 
In light of your request for discovery in this case, the Government hereby requests 
reciprocal discovery under Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(b). Specifically, we request that you allow 
inspection and copying of: (1) any books, or copies or portions thereof, which are in the 
defendant's possession, custody or control, and which the defendant intends to introduce as 
evidence or otherwise rely on at trial; and (2) any results or reports of physical or mental 
examinations and of scientific tests or experiments made in connection with this case, or copies 
thereof, which are in the defendant's possession or control, and which the defendant intends to 
introduce as evidence or otherwise rely on at trial or which were prepared by a witness whom the 
defendant intends to call at trial. 
The Government also requests that the defendant disclose prior statements of witnesses he 
will call to testify. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 26.2; United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225 (1975). We 
request that such material be provided on the same basis upon which we agree to supply the 
defendant with 3500 material relating to Government witnesses. 
Sentence Reduction for Acceptance of Responsibility 
This Office will oppose the additional one-point reduction under the Sentencing Guidelines 
available for defendants who plead prior to the Government's initiation of trial preparations 
pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(b), in the event your client has not entered a plea of guilty six weeks 
prior to trial. We will follow this policy whether or not suppression or other pretrial motions 
remain outstanding after this date and even if the trial date has not been announced by the Court 
six weeks in advance of the trial. 
06.20.2018 
EFTA00030535
--- PAGE 5 ---
Page 5 
Finally, please be advised that pursuant to the policy of this Office concerning plea offers, 
no plea offer is effective unless and until made in writing and signed by authorized representatives 
of the Office. In particular, discussions regarding the pretrial disposition of a matter that are not 
reduced to writing and signed by authorized representatives of the Office cannot and do not 
constitute a "formal offer" or a "plea offer," as those terms are used in Lafier v. Cooper, 132 S. Ct. 
1376 (2012); Missouri v. Fiye, 132 S. Ct. 1399 (2012). 
Very truly yours,

Hi =, 
(USANYS) 
Hope you're doing well. Are you able to send us a report tomorrow summarizing the search terms you ran for the 
responsiveness review in the Epstein search warrant database? We want to see which terms are pulling in the highest 
volume of documents. 
If at all possible, we'd really appreciate this tomorrow morning, as we're on a tight turnaround for finalizing our review. 
Thanks so much—

In response to your request for any statements made by Mr. Tartaglione during interviews at the MCC related to the 
investigation into an event involving Jeffrey Epstein on or about July 23, 2019, we are producing to you a zip folder 
with reports of those statements. The zip folder also contains reports of statements attributed to Mr. Tartaglione 
that were conveyed to MCC staff by Mr. Epstein. These materials have been marked "sensitive" pursuant to the 
protective order in this case and should be treated accordingly. 
In response to your additional request for "all the reports and video regarding Mr. Epstein's attempted suicide on July 
22-23rd," we do not believe these materials are relevant to this case or covered under Rule 16, and therefore will not 
be producing them. If you would like to discuss further, please give us a call.

Hi all! 
Great news — after I've reviewed, the drive going to defense today has all the required items for production! I believe we 
will be uploading NYC024318 1871 (iPhone) to this drive (and I've noted the tentative bates number for that on the index, 
attached here and updated on the shared, and in the cover letter, attached) — but other than that, we are all set. 
I've attached a (very basic) cover letter for defense, for your review and relevant additions. Since we are reproducing so 
much to MDC, I also created a unique index for the MDC drive on the shared index. I can attach that chart to defense's 
cover letter when it goes out, if that would be helpful, or I can just keep the MDC index section for our internal 
organization. 
is still working on copying the MDC drive. Hopefully we'll have an update soon. I'm happy to make any changes 
within the cover letter and/or index as necessary. Thank you all!

We are continuing to review the requests in your letter, and we intend to provide you with a written response to those 
requests as soon as we are able. We note, though, that your letter makes dozens of broad requests — including at least 
one request that Judge Nathan has already denied. As a result, although we fully intend to respond in sufficient time to

Re: 
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
We write in response to your letter of October 13, 2020 setting forth "requests for 
discovery, inspection, and copying, in accordance with the guarantees of the Fourth, Fifth, and 
Sixth Amendments, Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Federal Rules of 
Evidence, and such other laws and rules as may be applicable." The letter lists 22 specific requests 
(the "Requests"). The letter also makes a general request for materials pursuant to Brady v. 
Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963) and Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419 (1995), followed by 10 "specific 
Brady requests." 
As an initial matter, we take seriously our disclosure obligations, including those arising 
under Rule 16, Brady and its progeny, and Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972) and its 
progeny, and we intend to comply fully with those obligations. We intend to do so irrespective of 
whether you specifically request such material, or how you characterize that material. Indeed, as 
you are aware, we have already made substantial productions pursuant to Rule 16 and otherwise 
in this case. The Government will continue to fulfill all of its obligations going forward. 
However, your unilateral assertion that particular items constitute "Brady materials" does 
not itself render those materials subject to disclosure, let alone immediate disclosure some nine 
months before trial. To the contrary, a substantial amount of the materials sought in the Requests 
are plainly material to which you are entitled, if at all, solely pursuant to Title 18, United States 
EFTA00030569
--- PAGE 2 ---
Code, Section 3500 (hereinafter "3500 material") or Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 105 (1972) 
and its progeny (hereinafter "Giglio material"). As you are aware, it is the standard practice in this 
District that such material is produced shortly in advance of trial, a practice that has been widely 
held to be sufficient to satisfy the requirement that Giglio be produced "in sufficient time that the 
defendant will have a reasonable opportunity to act upon the information efficaciously." United 
States v. Rodriguez, 496 F.3d 221, 226 (2d Cir. 2007). Immediate disclosure of such material is 
not warranted simply because the defendant prefers it. See, e.g., United States v. Wey, 15 Cr. 611 
(AJN), 2017 WL 237651, at *23 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 18, 2017) (denying defendant's motion for 
immediate disclosure of Giglio material as defendant "fails to articulate any persuasive reason why 
immediate disclosure is required in this case, and the Court otherwise sees no basis to deviate so 
substantially from the typical practice"); United States v. Thompson, 13 Cr. 378 (AJN), 2013 WL 
6246489, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3, 2013) (denying request for early production of Jencks Act 
material); United States v. Hernandez, No. 09 Cr. 625 (HB), 2010 WL 26544, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 
6, 2010) (declining to order immediate disclosure of Giglio material, because the Government 
stated it would provide both Giglio and Jencks Act material "shortly before trial"); United States 
v. Davis, No. 06 Cr. 911 (LBS), 2009 WL 637164, at *14 (S.D.N.Y. March 11, 2009) ("The Second 
Circuit has held that a request for immediate or early disclosure [of Giglio material] has no basis 
in the law."). 
Consistent with that well-established practice, we intend to begin producing any 3500 and 
Giglio material substantially closer to trial. As we have indicated in prior letters to you and the 
Court, the Government is prepared to produce all statements and impeachment material for 
witnesses it expects to call at trial as early as four weeks prior to trial. Additionally, the 
Government is prepared to produce any statements by witnesses who it does not expect to call at 
trial as early as eight weeks prior to trial, subject to restrictions to protect those individuals' privacy 
to be negotiated by the parties. We note that, to date, the parties have not engaged in any 
discussions about a schedule for pretrial disclosures, but we are prepared to discuss such a schedule 
at your convenience. 
In return, we reiterate our request that the defendant disclose prior statements of any 
witnesses she will call to testify. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 26.2; United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225 
(1975). We request that such material be provided on the same basis upon which we agree to 
supply the defendant with such material relating to Government witnesses, and we are amenable 
to discussing a schedule for all parties' pretrial disclosures. We also reiterate our request for 
reciprocal discovery under Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(b). 
With respect to your remaining requests, we endeavor to respond directly to those below. 
By voluntarily providing this information, the Government is not limiting its evidence, arguments, 
or legal theories at trial in any way. If you have any questions or would like to confer further, 
please let us know and we will be happy to arrange a call or meeting to confer further at a mutually 
convenient time. 
Request 1— Any Oral, Written, or Recorded Statements Made by the Defendant: As 
noted in your request, the Government has produced statements made by the defendant in prior 
civil proceedings, as well as statements made at the time of her arrest. The Government is not 
aware of any other statements the defendant has made to law enforcement. 
EFTA00030570
--- PAGE 3 ---
Request 2 — Statements of Alleged Co-Conspirators: To the extent that your request 
seeks disclosure and identification of any statements of alleged co-conspirators that the 
Government intends to introduce at trial, this request is premature and without legal basis. To the 
extent the materials the defendant seeks may fall within the Jencks Act, the Jencks Act provides 
that "[i]n any criminal prosecution brought by the United States, no statement or report in the 
possession of the United States which was made by a Government witness or prospective 
Government witness (other than the defendant) shall be the subject of subpoena, discovery, or 
inspection until said witness has testified on direct examination in the trial of the case." 18 U.S.C. 
§ 3500(a). In addition, Rule 16 exempts from production, prior to trial, the materials the defendant 
seeks: "[T]his rule does not authorize the discovery or inspection of reports, memoranda, or other 
internal government documents made by an attorney for the government or other government agent 
in connection with investigating or prosecuting the case. Nor does this rule authorize the discovery 
or inspection of statements made by prospective government witnesses except as provided in 18 
U.S.C. § 3500." Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(2). In light of these provisions, requests for discovery of 
Jencks Act materials in advance of trial are uniformly denied in this District. Indeed, there is no 
legal basis to order the disclosure of statements of Government witnesses before their direct 
testimony at trial. See In re U.S., 834 F.2d 283, 284-87 (2d Cir. 1987) (issuing a writ of mandamus 
reversing District Court's order directing the Government "to produce all oral statement made by 
the defendants and coconspirators that the Government planned to offer at trial as admissions of a 
defendant" under Fed. R. Evid. 801); United States ex rel. Lucas v. Regan, 503 F.2d 1, 3 n.I (2d 
Cir. 1974); United States v. Sebastian, 497 F.2d 1267, 1268-69 (2d Cir. 1974); United States v. 
Percevault, 490 F.2d 126, 132 (2d Cir. 1974). 
Further, disclosure of any statements of alleged co-conspirators would necessitate the 
identification of co-conspirators. 
You identify no authority for the proposition that the 
Government is required to identify all known co-conspirators in connection with the charged 
conspiracy that the Government may seek to prove at trial, and to the contrary, courts in this district 
routinely deny similar requests. See, e.g., United States v. Castro, No. 08 Cr. 268 (NRB), 2008 
WL 5062724, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2008) ("An indictment need not identify all alleged co-
conspirators, nor specify the nature, time and place of every overt act the defendant or others 
allegedly took in furtherance of a conspiracy, nor must it set forth all the evidence the government 
intends to introduce."); United States v. Trippe, 171 F. Supp. 2d 230, 240 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) 
("[D]emands for particular information with respect to where, when, and with whom the 
Government will charge the defendant with conspiring are routinely denied."); United States v. 
Fruchter, 104 F. Supp. 2d 289, 313 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (denying "Defendants' request for names of 
all alders, abettors, unindicted co-conspirators, and confidential informants" as "nothing more than 
a request for a witness list"). 
That said, as previously stated, we intend to produce all Jencks Act and Giglio material in 
advance of trial and remain available to confer generally regarding a mutual schedule for pretrial 
and trial-related disclosures, including witness statements or Giglio material. 
Request 3 — Prior Criminal Records of the Defendant: The Government is not aware 
of any prior convictions or arrests of the defendant. 
EFTA00030571
--- PAGE 4 ---
Request 4 — Any Books, Papers, Documents, Data, Photographs, Tangible Objects, 
Buildings, or Places, or Copies or Portions of Any of These Items: The Government did not 
seize any documents or tangible items from the defendant, including through a search warrant. As 
you are aware from discovery, the Government has obtained a number of tangible items during its 
investigation through various means, including search warrants executed at properties of Jeffrey 
Epstein. We have already produced copies of many of those items in discovery, and, as we 
previously advised in August 2020, if you wish to inspect any of the physical evidence referenced 
in the produced materials, including items listed on search inventories, please let us know, and we 
will make arrangements for you to do so. 
Request 5 — Results or Reports of Any Physical or Mental Examination and of Any 
Scientific Test or Experiment: 
The Government is unaware of any physical or mental 
examination or scientific tests or experiments to which you are entitled. The Government is 
continuing to review files and will produce such materials to which you are entitled at the 
appropriate time. 
Request 6 — A Written Summary of Any Testimony the Government Intends to 
Introduce at trial under Federal Rules of Evidence 702, 703, or 705: To the extent the 
Government intends to call any expert to testify at trial, the Government will provide appropriate 
notice reasonably before trial, as is the standard practice in this District. The Government is 
prepared to engage in good faith discussions with you about a mutual schedule for pretrial and 
trial-related disclosures, including expert notice. 
Request 7 — The Identities of Minor Victim-1, Minor Victim-2, and Minor Victim-3 
(the "Minor Victims"): Such disclosure would be entirely premature nine months before trial. 
Indeed, in August, after the defendant sought an order directing the Government to disclose to 
defense counsel the identifies of the Minor Victims, Judge Nathan ruled that the request was 
premature, noting that production of discovery had just begun and the "parties have not yet 
engaged in discussions regarding an appropriate schedule for pretrial disclosures, including 
witness lists and § 3500 material." (Dkt. 49 at 1). Judge Nathan ordered that the parties "meet 
and confer on an appropriate schedule" "[fjollowing the close of discovery." (Id. at 2). The 
deadline for the production of Rule 16 discovery set by the Court is November 9, 2020. (Dkt. 25). 
The Government is prepared to engage in good faith discussions with the defense about an 
appropriate schedule for disclosure of 3500 material. 
Request 8 — The Complete Birthdays of the Minor Victims: In our discovery transmittal 
letter dated August 13, 2020, the Government included the months and years of birth for each of 
the Minor Victims so as to enable the defendant to evaluate whether she will make any motions or 
legal arguments relating to the ages of the victims. You have not identified why you need 
additional information regarding each of the Minor Victims at this time, the relevance of such 
information to this case, or the basis under which such information would be subject to disclosure 
or discovery at this time. Such information will be included in 3500 material for the Minor Victims 
which will be produced reasonably in advance of trial. 
Request 9 — All Written and Oral Communications Concerning the Negotiations 
Relating to the Non-Prosecution Agreement ("NPA") Signed by Epstein on September 24, 
EFTA00030572
--- PAGE 5 ---
2007: Your request does not articulate a basis in law for your assertion that you are entitled to the 
materials listed in Request 9—including communications between various Government and law 
enforcement entities and Epstein's attorneys and communications between and among "any 
government employees"—or that such materials fall within the scope of Rule 16 or any other 
disclosure obligation. Nor is the Government aware of any basis in law for this request. We note, 
in this respect, that neither the defendant nor the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District 
of New York is a party or signatory to the NPA, nor is the defendant or this Office named therein. 
As noted in the Government's letter of October 7, 2020 (Dkt. 63), although the Government 
does not believe it has any obligation to gather or review emails sent or received by attorneys at 
the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida ("USAO-SDFL") as part 
of its separate, prior investigation and prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein, as set forth in greater detail 
in that letter, the Government intends to gather certain martials from USAO-SDFL and conduct 
targeted searches of that material aimed at identifying potential Giglio or 3500 material for victims 
or witnesses relevant to this prosecution. See Dkt. 63 at 7. To the extent that review reveals such 
material, it will be produced at the appropriate stage in the litigation and according to any schedule 
set for pre-trial disclosures. 
Request 10 — A Complete Copy of the Diary: The Government has produced all pages 
of the diary in the Government's possession. The Government has never reviewed or possessed 
any other portions of the diary. To the extent this request calls for information that is not currently 
in the Government's possession or which is not subject to disclosure, you identify no legal basis 
or authority for this request, and we are not aware of any authority requiring us to obtain and/or 
disclose this information. 
Request 11 — A Complete, Unredacted Copy of FBI 302 Bearing Bates Numbers 
SDNY_GM_00114982-00114993: The Government has produced this particular version of the 
document in the form in which it received the document in response to a subpoena, which included 
redactions. To the extent the Government separately has access to an unredacted version of the 
same FBI 302, the Government will produce that unredacted version, as well as all other statements 
and impeachment material for witnesses, at the appropriate time, as discussed herein. 
Request 12 — All Versions and Drafts of "The Billionaires Playboy Club": The 
Government has produced all versions of "The Billionaires Playboy Club" in the Government's 
possession of which we are currently aware. The Government has produced these materials in the 
form in which it received those materials in response to a subpoena. To the extent this request 
calls for information that is not currently in the Government's possession or which is not subject 
to disclosure, you identify no legal basis or authority for this request, and we are not aware of any 
authority requiring us to obtain and/or disclose this information. 
Request 13 — Documents and Materials Related to the Minor Victims: As to your 
requests for documents and materials under Requests 13(a) through (f), the Government has 
produced any such materials relating to the Minor Victims listed in the Indictment that are in the 
Government's possession and that fall within the scope of Rule 16. As noted in the Government's 
October 7, 2020 letter (Dkt. 63), the Government is continuing to review files created and 
maintained by other offices for material that may be responsive to these requests and will produce 
EFTA00030573
--- PAGE 6 ---
any material identified through that review as appropriate. Additionally, as you know, the 
Government is preparing a production of responsive materials from electronic devices seized 
during searches of Epstein's New York and Virgin Island residences. To the extent the 
Government identifies any additional materials that it intends to introduce at trial, the Government 
will promptly produce such materials. 
With regard to your many requests for material that might fall within the scope of the 
Government's Giglio obligations, as you know and as set forth above, the uniform practice in this 
District, which the Government intends to follow, is to produce Giglio and Jencks Act materials 
simultaneously and shortly before trial. As noted above, this practice has been widely held to be 
sufficient to satisfy the requirement that Giglio be produced "in sufficient time that the defendant 
will have a reasonable opportunity to act upon the information efficaciously." Rodriguez, 496 
F.3d at 226. Immediate disclosure of such material is not warranted simply because the defendant 
prefers it. See, e.g., Hernandez, 2010 WL 26544, at *6; Davis, 2009 WL 637164, at *14. As noted 
above, the Government is prepared to produce all statements and impeachment material for 
witnesses it expects to call at trial as early as four weeks prior to trial, and statements for witnesses 
who it does not expect to call at trial as early as eight weeks prior to trial. 
The Government notes that, in response to your request for any submissions to the Epstein 
Victims' Compensation Program made by the Minor Victims or any other witness who has alleged 
that the defendant engaged in or facilitated improper sexual conduct at any time, the Government 
plays no role in administering that program. As such, the Government is not in possession of any 
submissions to this program. To the extent this request calls for information that is not currently 
in the Government's possession or which is not subject to disclosure, you identify no legal basis 
or authority for this request, and we are not aware of any authority requiring us to obtain and/or 
disclose this information. 
You have also requested under Request 13(i) "[a]ll communications between or among 
[the Minor Victims or other witnesses who allege that the defendant engaged in or facilitated 
improper sexual conduct], or between these individuals and counsel for any other such individual, 
including but not limited to, emails, text messages, social media posts, and other correspondence." 
The Government does not understand the basis for this request, and you identify none. To the 
extent this request calls for materials that are not currently in the Government's possession or 
which are not subject to disclosure, you identify no legal basis or authority for this request, and we 
are not aware of any authority requiring us to obtain and/or disclose this information. 
As to your request for "public statements made by these individuals concerning" Epstein 
or the defendant, the Government is unaware of any authority that such material falls within the 
scope of Rule 16 or that the Government is otherwise required to collect and provide materials that 
are publicly available. 
As to your request for records or reports of any physical, medical, mental, or psychological 
examinations of these individuals, to the extent any such materials exist and are in the 
Government's possession, they will be produced as part of the Government's production of Jencks 
Act and Giglio material at the appropriate stage in the litigation. 
EFTA00030574
--- PAGE 7 ---
As to your request for all "written and oral communications between the government and 
the attorneys for those individuals [certain victims]," the Government is unaware of any authority 
that entitles you to these materials. To the extent such materials constitute Giglio or Jencks Act 
materials, the Government will produce such materials at the appropriate time. Your request does 
not articulate a basis in law for your assertion that you are entitled to such material at this time, or 
that you are entitled to any such communications that do not constitute Giglio or Jencks Act 
material. 
Request 14 — All Written and Oral Communications and Other Documents 
Concerning Meetings between the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District 
of New York and Specified Attorneys for the Minor Victims and Other Witnesses: Your 
request does not articulate a basis in law for your assertion that you are entitled to such material. 
The Government is unaware of any authority that entitles you to these materials. 
Request 15 — Complete FBI Case File Regarding the Investigation of 
for Obstruction of Justice: As noted in our discovery transmittal letter dated August 
21, 2020, this file has no relation to your client and has no bearing on the charges in this case. The 
Government is not aware of the relevance of such records to the conduct at issue in this case, and 
you have not identified the relevance of such records, although we are willing to discuss the basis 
for any such request at your convenience. 
Request 16 — Copies of the Prosecution Memo and Indictment Drafted as Part of the 
United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida (“USAO-SDFL"): The 
Government is unaware of any authority that entitles you to the documents that you seek under 
this request. To the contrary, Rule 16 exempts from disclosure "internal government documents 
made by an attorney for the government or other government agent in connection with 
investigating or prosecuting the case." Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(1)(F)(2); see also United States v. 
Annstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 463 (1996) ("[U]nder Rule 16(a)(2), [a defendant] may not examine 
Government work product in connection with his case."); United States v. Ghailani, 687 F. Supp. 
2d 365, 369 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (concluding that an internal government memorandum fell within 
Rule 16(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and was therefore "protected against 
disclosure regardless of its materiality."). 
Request 17 — E-mails, Text Messages, Letters, or Other Written Communications To 
or From the Defendant: To the extent the Government identifies material that is discoverable 
under Rule 16 and responsive to this request, the Government will promptly produce such 
materials. In particular, the Government has seized and worked to extract data from approximately 
electronic devices in connection with search warrants executed at Epstein's properties. As 
noted in the Government's discovery transmittal letter dated October 20, 2020, we anticipate 
producing only the materials designated responsive to the terms of the search warrants. The 
Government has directed its vendor to download these materials from the electronic database on 
which they are stored and to have those materials ready for production to you by November 9, 
2020. 
Request 18 — Medical Records or Reports Concerning Epstein: The Government is not 
aware of the relevance of such records to the conduct at issue in this case, and you have not 
EFTA00030575
--- PAGE 8 ---
identified the relevance of such records. The Government is unaware of any authority that entitles 
you to these materials, and you provide none. 
Request 19 — Subpoenas and Voluntary Requests for Production of Documents Issued 
in Connection with or Related to this Case, and All Evidence Obtained By Subpoena or 
Voluntary Production: The Government is unaware of any authority that entitles you to the 
grand jury subpoenas and voluntary requests for documents that you seek under this request, and 
you provide none. To the extent you seek evidence obtained by the Government "by subpoena or 
from voluntary production (to the extent it has not already been produced)," the Government has 
produced all subpoena returns that fall within the scope of Rule 16 that the Government has 
received through the date of the indictment. The Government has also endeavored to make clear 
in its productions which materials were obtained pursuant to subpoena. To the extent the 
Government identifies or receives additional subpoena returns, the Government will promptly turn 
over materials that fall within the scope of Rule 16. To the extent such subpoena returns contain 
Giglio material or 3500 material, the Government will produce that material at the appropriate 
time as agreed to by the parties and the Court. Similarly, the Government has produced and will 
continue to produce materials obtained by voluntary production to the extent such materials fall 
within Rule 16. To the extent such materials contain Giglio material or 3500 material, the 
Government will produce such materials closer to trial on the agreed upon schedule. 
Request 20 — Evidence the Government Intends to Introduce Pursuant to Federal 
Rule of Evidence 404(b) or as Background of the Conspiracies: With respect to any evidence 
the Government may seek to offer pursuant to Rule 404(b), as you are aware, Rule 404 requires 
only that "reasonable notice of the general nature of any such evidence" be provided sometime 
"before trial." Fed. R. Evid. 404(b)(2)(A)-(B). In this Circuit, that provision typically is construed 
to require notice several weeks before trial. See United States v. Giffen, 379 F. Supp. 2d 337, 345 
(S.D.N.Y. 2004) (in the "'absence of any threat to the safety of prospective witnesses and the .. . 
Rule 404(b) evidence [is important to] th[e] action,"' courts in this District have generally found 
that disclosures made approximately 30 to 45 days prior to trial constitute "reasonable notice" to 
defendants) (quoting United States v. Nachamie, 91 F. Supp. 2d 565, 577 (S.D.N.Y. 2000); Giffen, 
379 F. Supp. 2d at 344 (Rule 404 does not obligate the Government to provide "unduly early 
notice" because "early disclosure presents a significant burden on preparation of the Government's 
case."). 
Here, and consistent with the requirements of Rule 404, the Government intends to identify 
such evidence and provide notice substantially closer to trial. 
As noted throughout, the 
Government is amenable to a discussion about a joint schedule for pretrial disclosures, including 
404(b) notice, at your convenience. 
Requests 21 and 22 — Information about the Grand Jury that Indicted this Case: A 
grand jury sitting in White Plains, New York that was empaneled in November 2019 returned 
Indictment 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) and Superseding Indictment S 120 Cr. 330 (AJN). No grand jurors 
participated remotely in any session relevant to this case. To the extent your request seeks "a list 
of grand jurors, their attendance dates, [or] the reasons for any absence," as well as information on 
persons present during grand jury proceedings, the Government is not aware of any authority that 
entitles you to the information you seek under these requests. Grand jury proceedings are not 
EFTA00030576
--- PAGE 9 ---
governed by Rule 16 and therefore are not discoverable. Disclosure of information related to grand 
jury proceedings is not authorized by Rule 16 and is permitted only when "ordered upon a showing 
of particularized need." See United States v. Sells Engineering, 463 U.S. 418, 443 (1983) ("[w]e 
have consistently construed [Rule 6(e)] . .. to require a strong showing of particularized need for 
grand jury materials before any disclosure will be permitted"); see also Dennis v. United States, 
384 U.S. 855, 869-870 (1966). This is because grand jury proceedings are afforded a "presumption 
of regularity" that may be dispelled only by particularized proof of irregularities in the grand jury 
process. United States v. Leung, 40 F.3d 577, 581 (2d Cir. 1994). 
"[SI pecific Brady requests": The Government recognizes its obligations under Brady and 
its progeny and will provide timely disclosure if and when such material comes to light. With 
respect to your requests under the section titled "Exculpatory Evidence," the Government is not 
aware of any evidence suggesting that Maxwell was not involved in or aware of the conduct alleged 
in the Indictment. The Government will provide timely disclosure if it learns of any such material. 
Certain of your requests suggest your view that any evidence that Epstein sexually abused or 
assaulted a victim, but without the knowledge or participation of the defendant, is somehow 
exculpatory. We note that your request is neither limited in time to the period charged in the 
Indictment nor limited to victims who claim to have been minors at the time of their abuse. You 
identify no basis in law for such a broad request, nor is the Government aware of one. Your request 
fails to explain how, for example, evidence that a witness alleges that she was sexually abused by 
Epstein, "with or without the involvement" of the defendant, but who was not a minor at the time 
of the alleged sexual abuse, or who claims to have been abused years after the conduct charged in 
the Indictment, is somehow exculpatory. As noted in the Government's letter of October 20, 2020, 
the well-established law of this Circuit generally precludes a defendant from offering evidence 
that a defendant did not participate in criminal conduct on a particular occasion—or of their law-
abiding conduct during uncharged periods or uncharged events—to rebut the Government's 
evidence with respect to the charged crimes or events. Dkt. 65; see, e.g., United States v. Scarpa, 
897 F.2d 63, 70 (2d Cir. 1990) ("A defendant may not seek to establish his innocence . . . through 
proof of the absence of criminal acts on [other] specific occasions."). To the extent that you wish 
to provide us grounds or any authority as to why such information would be exculpatory, please 
do so. 
You also request evidence concerning witnesses who contacted the Government or law 
enforcement about sexual abuse by Epstein or the defendant who were determined not to be 
credible, as well as "negative" investigative efforts to verify information provided by any and all 
witnesses. We are unaware of any authority requiring the production of such information. If you 
would like to clarify your request, and the authority for it, we will consider it further. 
Many of your additional specific requests for material appear to fall within Giglio and 
Jencks Acts materials, rather than Brady, including, for example, the requests for impeachment 
evidence, Giglio information, evidence of bias or motive to lie, contradictory statements of any 
prospective government witness, and evidence of criminal investigations or misconduct of any 
government witness. As described above, the Government intends to follow the uniform practice 
in this District, and produce before trial Giglio and Jencks Act materials for witnesses it expects 
to call at trial, as well as any statements by witnesses who it does not expect to call at trial. The 
Government has noted a proposed schedule in this letter. We are amenable to discussing an 
EFTA00030577
--- PAGE 10 ---
alternative schedule for mutual pretrial disclosures. We also reiterate our request that the 
defendant disclose prior statements of witnesses she will call to testify. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 26.2; 
United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225 (1975). We request that such material be provided on the 
same basis upon which we agree to supply the defendant with such material relating to Government 
witnesses. 
To the extent you are requesting that the Government produce items beyond its Brady and 
Rule 16 obligations, the Government has no such obligation at this time. See Weatherford v. 
Bursey, 429 U.S. 545, 559 (1977). As you know, in all federal criminal cases, it is Rule 16 that 
principally governs pretrial discovery. Rule 16 is not "intended to provide the defendant with 
access to the entirety of the government's case against him." See, e.g., Percevault, 490 F.2d at 
130. Nor does Rule 16 "entitle a criminal defendant to a broad and blind fishing expedition among 
items possessed by the Government on the chance that something impeaching might turn up." 
United States v. Delacruz, No. 14 Cr. 815 (KBF), 2015 WL 2211943, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. May 12, 
2015) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
If there are any specific anticipated defenses that would bear upon the Government's 
ongoing review for items that may be material to preparing the defense, you are welcome to outline 
such defenses. 
Conclusion 
The Government remains available to confer further on any of the topics outlined above. 
The Government also requests that the defendant confirm whether she has, to date, met her 
reciprocal disclosure obligations under Rule 16(b) and we renew our request for reciprocal 
disclosure from the defendant. 
Very truly yours, 
Acting United States Attorney

Hi =, 
(USANYS) 
(USANYS) 
I hope you're doing well. Because of some discovery accessibility issues we're having in the Ghislaine Maxwell case, we 
would like to provide a clean laptop to Maxwell in MDC for discovery review purposes. The laptop need only permit 
review of standard files — word, pdf, .tif, .xls, etc. All other capabilities and programs can be disabled. I understand we 
did something similar in the Avenatti case, and we'd like to do the same here. Would that be possible? It would be a 
huge help to us if you could possibly prep and provide us with a laptop for this purpose. 
Thanks so much—

Hi 
I have finally got through to the sergeant at Wilton Manors and he does not have any records on me ever or Ron Eppinger or the guy 
that I was picked up with supposedly named Charlie. It could be that they have destroyed the records being a minor or some other 
legality that I am not aware of but I am in dire need of that information and have hit a road block. I know this is a long shot but is there 
any way that you would know this information? 
I can not express how sincerely apologetic I am to keep bothering you!! I am just hoping to finish what I have started and if I do... Trust 
me it will be well worth it in the end for so many other victims and future victims. 
Thank you so much for everything you have thus far helped me!!

Hi 
Thank you for getting back to me on your day off! 
I just remember when the tabloids sent their photographer out, they took note of the date on the back which was in 1997 and 
possibly took a picture of it but as I do not want to contact the tabloids right now, I just need the evidence to ensure that is 
correct. If you can, when you get back to the office, is there any chance you could have a look to see if there in fact a date 
mentioned or photographed, it would be very helpful and I would be more than appreciative. 
Have a nice day!!

than that we have been trying to make way for present day victims. It's astounding how much abuse & trafficking cases there really is 
going on. 
I was hoping that you might have had a chance to look into the Eppinger case or just the dates I was with him as it would help me

We will need to export the data from the database, but we will need to send a hard drive to the vendor as the file size of 
the production will be too large to place on a FTP site for download. I would also suggest getting a hard drive from counsel 
so you can copy the data on the hard drive. I can have the vendor start the export on Monday. Can you please see if you 
can get a 1 TB drive to send to PAE so they can copy the production on the drive.

Hey—, 
I leave it up to the AUSAs on your question regarding native files. The productions look good to me but I do have one 
question. The drive that we sent to be uploaded contained about 41,000 files. In these two productions I only see a total 
of about 22,000. Is that because there are some natives that couldn't be imaged and are thus not viewable on the

This seems right to me. First, this goes beyond what we said we would do or told the court we would do. 
Second, in any event they are separately gathering any potentially relevant emails from the agent with 
victims. Third, we have no reason to believe there were significant gaps in retention or collection for 
such that any of his emails would be in what we already have.

Today, we spoke with SA 
one of the original FBI agents from the Florida investigation of Epstein. 
told us he has a number of emails with AUSA 
regarding the case. Our view is that we do not need to 
collect those emails from 
because we have already received thousands of 
emails, which were 
collected by OPR and should encompass any emails with the FBI about the Epstein case. 
is going to send us 
any emails he received from victims or witnesses. We also discussed other documents 
has in his possession 
from the Epstein investigation and asked him to send us any that sounded potentially discoverable. 
Please let us know if this approach sounds right to you or if you would like to discuss. 
Thanks,

Thanks very much for talking this morning. As discussed, attached is a draft application for an amended search warrant 
correcting the FBI barcode numbers for 3 devices that were seized from Epstein's NY residence. In case it's useful, I'm also

Florence Hutner, Esq. 
General Counsel 
Office of the Chief Medical Examiner 
Re: Autopsy Report and File for Jeffrey Epstein 
Dear Ms. Hutner: 
By letter dated August 28, 2019, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern 
District of New York ("USAO") requested that the OCME withhold from disclosure to any third 
party (i) "any documents, evidence or information made available to OCME by the USAO or the 
FBI—including documents, records, or materials from the MCC—or created by OCME or within 
the OCME case file that include, reflect, or contain information made available to OCME by the 
USAO or FBI"; and (ii) "the names and identifying information of any federal law enforcement 
agents or employees who were interviewed by the OCME, along with the substance of any 
statements or interviews made by those agents or employees" (the "August 28 Letter"). 
At OCME's request, the USAO has made proposed redactions to the version of the OCME 
report and file for Jeffrey Epstein that was previously provided by OCME to the FBI, consistent 
with the requests set forth in the August 28 Letter. That redacted document is attached hereto. In 
order to preserve the integrity of the ongoing investigation, in addition to the requests set forth in 
the August 28 Letter, we also request that OCME withhold from disclosure to any third party this 
letter and its attachment, and the August 28 Letter. We appreciate your willingness to comply 
with these requests. Please contact us with any further questions. 
Very truly yours,

Is there an agenda for this? If so, I have no problem meeting in person, but if we just expect it to be like 10 minutes of 
introducing ourselves then I'd personally vote phone call.

Draft Pre-Voir Dire Remarks — November 2, 2021 
I 
United States v. Maxwell, 20cr330 
Preliminary Remarks Prior to Voir Dire 
To be recorded and played on 11/16-11/19 
Introduction 
Welcome back to the Southern District. Thank you again for your time and service. As I 
mentioned in my remarks to you when you filled out the questionnaire, I'm Judge Nathan and I 
am the judge who will preside over this case. The questionnaire you previously filled out was the 
first step in the July selection process. Today will be the second step. Some of you will be 
excused today and will not have to return for this case, although you may be directed to go 
to 
through a similar process in another case. Others may be directed to return tomorrow if 
necessary. And ultimately, some of you will return for the third and final step in the process. 
That will take place on November 29. In any event, after you complete this step of the process 
today, you will receive instructions on next steps that are particular to you. 
As you know from my prior remarks to you and from the questionnaire, we're here today 
to select a jury to serve in a criminal case, called the United States against Ghislaine Maxwell. As 
you read in the questionnaire, the Indictment alleges that Ghislaine Maxwell conspired with and 
aided and abetted Jeffrey Epstein to entice minor females to travel to engage in criminal sex 
I8 
activity, to transport minors to engage in criminal sexual activity, and to engage in sex trafficking 
of a minor. Ms. Maxwell has pled not guilty to all charges. Ms. Maxwell is presumed innocent, 
and before she can be found guilty on any charge, the jury must find that the Government has 
proven each element of that crime beyond a reasonable doubt. 
Thank you for participating in this process. The process of selecting a jury in a criminal 
case is a critical part of our justice system. The purpose of this process is to select those jurors who 
can be fair and impartial to both sides in this case. Some people find that they can be fair and 
EFTA00030633
--- PAGE 3 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 404 Filed 11/02/21 Page 3 of 6 
I 
impartial in one kind of case, but for various reasons, related to their own life experiences or views, 
can't be fair in another kind of case. The process that we use is designed to help us figure out 
whether you can be fair and impartial to both sides in this case. 
If during the course of this process you come to believe that because of something that 
you have experienced or because of something you've heard or read that you cannot be fair and 
impartial—that is that you would favor either the Government or the Defendant regardless of 
what the evidence shows—then you must tell me. It's not unusual, and there's no reason to be 
embarrassed about it. 
But the system only works if all of our citizens are willing and prepared to serve as jurors 
to 
when they can do so fairly and impartially. I do not expect that anybody would seek to avoid this 
it 
important duty for any but the most compelling reasons. 
As I mentioned in my prior remarks, the Court has taken a number of steps to help ensure 
the process for selected jurors is as safe and easy as possible. We have masking and distancing 
protocols. We have reconfigured courtrooms to enhance safety measures. The Court will 
provide transportation for selected jurors to and from the courthouse each day. Breakfast, 
snacks, and lunch will be provided for you. 
To conduct the next phase of the process, I will ask each of you some questions 
individually. We'll do that in a separate courtroom where I and the lawyers and the Defendant 
are sitting now. You all will be brought in the courtroom one at a time. Bear in mind that this is 
a public courtroom. To protect your privacy, I will only refer to you by your juror number. 
Please do not state any identifying information. For example, if we talk about your job you 
could say that you are a sales clerk at a large retail store, without stating the specific name of 
your employer. This is to protect your privacy. Even with those privacy protections in place, if 
EFTA00030634
--- PAGE 4 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 404 Filed 11/02/21 Page 4 of 6 
I 
there is something that would be too difficult or embarrassing for you to say on the public record, 
please let me know. And please keep in mind that if you are selected as a juror, we will continue 
to refer to you only by your juror number throughout the process. 
Now, if you are selected as a juror, your job is going to be to listen to the evidence and to 
my instructions on the law and to make a determination that's based only on the law. So I want to 
speak to you generally about some things to keep in mind. 
The first thing is, as Ms. Maxwell sits here now, she's presumed to be innocent. She is 
presumed innocent until and only if the July finds that she is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. 
As I just explained to you, she's been indicted for a number of crimes, but an indictment is just 
to 
an accusation. It is not evidence and it doesn't mean that Ms. Maxwell is guilty of anything. You 
I I 
can't assume that she is guilty or more likely to be guilty just because she's been charged with 
committing these crimes. That's the reason we have trials, to determine whether the Government 
can prove a defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. A defendant in a criminal case does not 
have to prove that she is not guilty. That means a defendant does not have to testify, or to put on 
any evidence and a juror can't hold that against a defendant if she makes that choice. 
The next thing is that as jurors you must follow the law as I give it to you, even if you 
don't agree with it or if you think the law should be different. 
You also have to base your verdict on the evidence, not on something that you've read in 
the newspapers or the intemet or seen on television or heard about on social media or in 
discussions with friends, family, or colleagues. And you can't base your decision in this case on 
something that you might have read or heard about another case. 
As I said before, there is significant media interest in this case. As jurors you are not 
permitted to read any news about this case. You cannot read or watch or listen to any accounts 
EFTA00030635
--- PAGE 5 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 404 Filed 11/02/21 Page 5 of 6 
I 
of this case at all. If you see something in the paper or online, you're just going to have to turn 
the page or close the browser. You can't read it. 
Equally important, you're not permitted to discuss this case with anyone else while the 
case is going on. Even with your fellow jurors, you can't discuss the case until you've heard all 
the evidence and I've given my instructions on the law. Again, that's because you can only 
consider the evidence that you hear in the courtroom, not anything outside of the courtroom. You 
have to keep an open mind. Nor may you discuss the case with friends or family until after your 
jury service is complete. You can tell them that you are a juror in a criminal case in federal court 
and that the judge has told you that you are not permitted to say anything further. 
to 
Similarly, until you are excused from jury service, you cannot post anything about your 
experience as a juror on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok or any kind of social media. 
Another instruction, you can't look up or google or do any other kind of search about anything 
related to the case or anyone involved in the case. 
The reason for these rules, as I am sure you understand, is they protect the integrity of the 
is 
trial and assure that both sides receive a fair trial. 
Jurors in criminal cases base their verdicts on the evidence that they hear in the 
courtroom, not on something that somebody else tells you, not on something that you see on TV 
Is 
or on social media. That's why if you're selected as a juror, I'll be reminding you of these rules 
regularly. You can't watch news accounts, look anything up or speak to anybody else about the 
case. You would be violating the oath you have taken as jurors and you would be violating my 
orders if you were to do that. 
Finally, you must report to me through my court deputy any effort by any person to speak 
with you about the case or to influence you about the case or to get information about the case.

I do want to thank all of you for the time you've invested already in this process. Our 
system cannot function unless we have good people like you who are willing to give up their 
time and to serve as jurors. 
Please sit quietly until your number is called and you are brought into the courtroom for 
questioning by me. Although you may use your electronic devices while you are waiting 
(bearing in mind of course all of my instructions that forbid you to do any research or engage in 
any communications about the case through any means), you must turn off and hand over any 
electronic devices to the Jury Department staff before you are brought into the courtroom. I look 
forward to meeting each of you in person soon. Thank you.
