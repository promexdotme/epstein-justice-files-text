From your standpoint I am pretty confident it is over. Roy Black called me and said: "before you hang up — it's all 
over with Epstein ... I just need to update things." 
called Roy back who, over course wanted more time but 
was told that there would be no extensions etc. Although I anticipate some last minute tinkering, since it is now Thursday, 
it is 50/50 whether they will make our Monday 5:00 pm deadline to plead, be sentenced and surrender. Thanks,

Just as a follow through: Since we sent our letter, it has been complete radio silence from defense counsel. We alerted 
the AG's office that it was likely that they might try to contact them, and we advised them that they should not take their 
calls. The AG was advised of the matter. What is the status for you folks? Thanks.

Dear Jay and Roy: 
We just finished our hearing with Judge Marra. He has ordered us to make the Agreement available to the 
plaintiffs in this case pursuant to a protective order limiting the disclosure to the victims and their counsel only. 
He further has ordered that we have to make the agreement available to any other identified victim and her 
attorney, so long as they also agree to be bound by the protective order. Judge Marra stated that the plaintiffs can 
litigate the issue of further disclosure directly with Mr. Epstein in the context of their civil suits. 
When I receive the Court's order and a signed protective order, I will provide them to you.

Importance: Normal 
Hi all — I spoke with someone from the Florida Bar this afternoon. She told me that they would be issuing a 
written opinion by the end of the week that was essentially a "non-opinion." In other words, the letter will say 
that she cannot advise us regarding our victim notification obligations under federal law. She did, however, tell 
me that the solicitation rules don't apply to our Office in a situation like this because we are not soliciting 
employment from the victims. I asked about whether the Office had reached a decision regarding Mr. 
Josefsberg's related inquiry, but she would not provide me with any information, citing the Bar's confidentiality 
rules. 
I am going to wait to hear from Mr. Josefsberg or Ms. Ezell regarding the response they receive from the Bar 
before I send out the final batch of letters so that I can revise them if necessary. 
On another note, Dexter, have you heard anything from Mr. Edwards regarding the resolution of the Doe v. 
United States case?

Alan, 
It was great seeing you and your beautiful family as well. As we were 
talking, I couldn't help but think that Don Rickles once referred to 
that same area as "G-d's waiting room." What a transformation! 
Hopefully, you'll be coming down for many years to come and I look 
forward to maintaining and growing our friendship. 
Regarding Mr. Epstein, the United States Attorney's Office will not 
interfere with how the Palm Beach Sheriffs Office administers the 
sentence imposed by the Court. That being said, this does not mean that 
the USAO condones or encourages PBSO to mitigate the terms and 
conditions of his sentence. Furthermore, it does not mean that, if 
contacted for our position concerning alternative custody or in-home 
detention, we would not object. To be clear, if contacted we will 
object. Naturally, I also expect that no one on behalf of Mr. Epstein 
will use my assurance to you to affirmatively represent to PBSO that the 
USAO does not object to an alternative custody or in-home detention. 
Have a safe trip back to Boston and I look forward to reading your new 
book. Take care,

Dear IN 
It was so nice having a relaxed drink and conversation on the porch of 
our neighborhood bistro. Now you see why we love this location so much 
and want to make it our second (and perhaps our first) home. I 
appreciate your kind words of advice, encouragement and friendship.

I also appreciate your candoir and directness about the difficult and 
emotioally exhausting case we both went through. I especially appreciate 
your assurance that the feds will not interfere with how the Palm Beach 
sheriff administers jefferey's sentence as long as he is treated like 
any similarly situated inmate. My understanding is that if the sheriff 
were to decide, in the normal course of events, that the circumstances 
warranted Jeffrey completing the custodial portion of his sentence under 
alternative custody/in-home detention, your office would not intrude. 
Thanks again for meeting me on such short notice. I will keep you 
apprised of our rental or purchase plans and am looking forward to 
spending time with you and your life when we return in November.

AFFIDAVIT OF JACK A. GOLDBERGER, ESQUIRE 
STATE OF FLORIDA 
) SS 
COUNTY OF PALM BEACH 
) 
BEFORE 
ME, 
the 
undersigned 
authority, 
personally 
appeared 
having personal knowledge and being duly sworn, deposes and says: 
1. 
I, Jack A. Goldberger, have personal knowledge of the matters set 
forth herein. I am an attorney licensed to practice in the State of Florida since 
1978. I am a partner with the law firm of Atterbury Goldberger & Weiss, P.A., 
located at One Clearlake Centre, Suite 1400, 250 Australian Avenue South, West 
Palm Beach, FL 33401. 
2. 
My practice includes and specializes in the defense of criminal 
matters. I am board certified in criminal law. I have been and currently am the 
criminal defense attorney for JEFFREY EPSTEIN. 
3. 
I represented Mr. EPSTEIN in the negotiation of and entering into a 
Non-Prosecution Agreement with the United States Attorney's Office (USAO) for 
the Federal Southern District of Florida. The terms and conditions of the Non-
Prosecution Agreement also entailed the entering of a Plea Agreement with the 
State Attorney's Office, Palm Beach County, State of Florida. 
(The Non-
Prosecution Agreement shall hereinafter be referred to as the "NPA"). 
4. 
By its terms, the NPA took effect on June 30, 2008. Also, pursuant 
to the terms of the NPA, any criminal prosecution against EPSTEIN is deferred 
as long as the terms and conditions of the NPA are fulfilled by EPSTEIN.

Case 9:08-cv-80119-KAM 
Document 65-3 
Entered on FLSD Docket 03/25/2009 
Page 2 of 3 
5. 
The criminal matters against EPSTEIN remain ongoing until the 
NPA expires by its terms in late 2010 and as long as the USAO determines 
EPSTEIN has complied with those terms and conditions. The threat of criminal 
prosecution against EPSTEIN by USAO in the Southern District of Florida 
continues presently and through late 2010. 
6. 
Pursuant to the terms of the NPA, the USAO possesses the right to 
declare that the agreement has been breached, give EPSTEIN's counsel notice, 
and attempt to move forward with a prosecution. As of the date of this Affidavit, 
the USAO has taken the position on a number of occasions that it might consider 
the following actions by EPSTEIN to be a breach of the NPA. 
• Investigation by EPSTEIN (by and through his attorneys) of this Plaintiff 
and the other Plaintiffs in other pending civil cases for purposes of 
defending the civil actions; 
• EPSTEIN's contesting damages in this action and other civil actions. 
• EPSTEIN or his legal representatives making statements to the press 
about this Plaintiff or the other Plaintiffs. 
• Using the word "jail" instead of "imprisonment" in the plea agreement with 
the Palm Beach County State Attorney's Office. 
7. 
EPSTEIN, through counsel, submitted a Freedom of Information 
Act request to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for documents relating to 
this and the other cases; the FBI denied the request stating the materials are at 
this time exempt from disclosure because they are in an investigative file, i.e. the 
matter is still an ongoing criminal investigation.

Re: Jeffrey Epstein 
Dear 
Facsimile: 
I appreciate your letter of June 17, 2009. I sincerely hope that any and all issues that 
could generate an adversarial relationship between Mr. Epstein and the United States Attorney's 
Office are in our past. Like you, we hope that the ongoing, complex, and at times vigorous 
litigation will not again require your involvement, nor result in any belief on your part that any 
legal position taken by Mr. Epstein's counsel conflicts with the Non-Prosecution Agreement 
("NPA"). 
In order to avoid future misunderstandings, however, I would like to have a discussion 
with you specifically about our ongoing obligations as you understand them under the NPA. As 
you know from past experience, and as Mr. Acosta previously acknowledged in letters to my 
partner Ken Starr (on December 4, 2007) and Lilly Ann Sanchez (on December 19, 2007), the 
language of ¶ 8 is "far from simple," and, in certain respects, subject to significant ambiguity. 
I believe it is both necessary and appropriate to seek immediate clarification from the 
goverment about its understanding of a few provisions in the NPA. It is likely by no fault of our 
own that these issues will come before a judge or an independent third party, whose job it will be 
to interpret the intent of the parties. In those circumstances, I think the court would most likely 
turn to both of us and directly seek our views, as the drafters of the agreement, before rendering 
its own opinion. Therefore, I believe it would bring about the finality that we both seek in a 
much reduced time frame if we could discuss several of the more ambiguous provisions 
contained in the NPA.

One specific example comes to mind. First, we clearly understood during the course of 
negotiating the NPA, and believe that both the language of the NPA and our prior 
correspondence with your Office confirm, that the waiver of liability set forth in Paragraph 8 at 
most was designed to allow an identified individual the right to assert a single violation of a 
section 2255 predicate. The waiver of liability does not embrace situations where a particular 
plaintiff asserts multiple violations. Thus, compliance with paragraph 8's waiver of liability 
would require at most that Mr. Epstein stipulate to the existence of a single enumerated predicate 
that would entitle an otherwise eligible plaintiff to actual damages (or the applicable statutory 
minimum damages where actual damages fall short of that floor), leaving aside the issue of 
whether the waiver is applicable to contested litigation or only the cases where there would be 
agreed damage resolutions. In addition, if we believe that a predicate act is time-barred, as 
indeed we understand was the case with respect to all such acts in relation to one plaintiff, a 
proper construction of the waiver of liability would not preclude the reliance on a statute of 
limitations defense. 
Given your Office's prior acknowledgements that the language of the NPA is far from 
clear, we very much would appreciate an opportunity to discuss Paragraph 8 with you in the very 
near future in order to clarify a few pivotal questions raised by the NPA. I assure you that 
Mr. Epstein intends to abide fully by the terms of the NPA. And it is my sincere hope that our 
discussion can avert future risks that anything we do will cause you to believe that there has been 
a breach of the NPA. 
Finally, I enclose a letter in response to your June 15 letter in order to provide you with 
our perspective on the issues you raised. I hope our differing views on certain events over the 
past several years as reflected in my letter will not in anyway divert us from a common goal of 
having Mr. Epstein complete his NPA obligations without further tension with your Office. 
Sincerely, 
P. 
Jay P. Lefkowitz, P.C.

E-Mail: 
Once again I need to send you a note about Jeffrey Epstein, mainly to keep 
you in the loop so we don't inadvertently violate any provision of his agreement 
with your office. As I am sure you are aware, Mr. Epstein has finished the 
incarceration portion of his sentence and is now serving the one year of 
community control as mandated by both his state plea and the terms of the non-
prosecution agreement with the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern 
District of Florida. 
Mr. Epstein is in compliance with all terms of his community control and 
is applying for transfer of his supervision from the State of Florida to his primary 
residence, the Virgin Islands. This transfer is being requested through the 
Intrastate Compact for Transfer of Adult Supervision (ICAOS). The ICAOS is the 
mechanism for which transfers of probation and community control are 
effectuated. The process requires the offender to seek the approval of the sending 
state (in this case Florida) and, if they agree, the receiving state (in this case the 
United States Virgin Islands) and the United States Virgin Islands after 
investigation has pre-approved the transfer under the same exact conditions of 
supervision as imposed in Mr. Epstein's community control sentence in the State 
of Florida. 
Even though Mr. Epstein is requesting the transfer he is still at the home

in Palm Beach following the rules of state community control. As Mr. Epstein's 
lawyers, we believe that his request to administratively transfer his community 
control is in full compliance with both his state plea agreement and the non-
prosecution agreement with the United States Attorney's Office. Nonetheless we 
have taken to heart your previous suggestion of erring on the side of caution and 
thus we are advising you of this request. 
I am happy to discuss this with you at any time. I did not want to set an 
appointment to see you on this issue since I imagine you have more pressing 
matters to deal with than a transfer of a state community control matter.

To the extent that we do want to say anything, I think (based upon earlier conversations with 
Alex) that our Office's position was that this started as a state case and Alex wanted it to stay a 
state case, but to provide for minimum protections for the victims, both in terms of jail time and 
compensation — in other words, this was a floor, not a ceiling. My personal opinion was that 
Alex wanted Barry Krischer to save face, but Alex never said that openly to me.

United States Attorney 
Southern District of Florida 
500 South Australian Ave., Suite 400 
West Palm Beach, FL 33401 
Facsimile: 
July 
, 
NOTIFICATION OF IDENTIFIED VICTIMS 
On June 30, 2008, Jeffrey Epstein (hereinafter referred to as "Epstein) entered a plea of 
guilty to violations of Florida Statutes Sections 796.07 (felony solicitation of prostitution) and 
796.03 (procurement of minors to engage in prostitution), in the 15th Judicial Circuit in and for 
Palm Beach County (Case Nos. 2006-cf-009495AXXXMB and 2008- 
) and 
was sentenced to a term of eighteen months' imprisonment to be followed by 
years of 
probation. 
In light of the entry of the guilty plea and sentence, and pursuant to the terms of the 
deferred prosecution agreement between Epstein and the United States Attorney's Office for the 
Southern District of Florida (hereinafter referred to as "the Office"), the Office hereby provides 
notice to Epstein that the following is a list of individuals whom the Office was prepared to name 
as victims in an Indictment charging Epstein with violations of federal statutes enumerated in 
Title 18, United States Code, Section 2255 (hereinafter referred to as "identified individuals"). 
The terms of the deferred prosecution agreement provide that the identified individuals 
shall have the same right to seek damages pursuant to Title 18, United States Code, Section 2255, 
as they would have had if Mr. Epstein had been tried and convicted of those enumerated offenses 
in a federal court. Section 2255 provides, in relevant part: 
Any person who, while a minor, was a victim of a violation of section . . . 2422, or 
2423 of this title and who suffers personal injury as a result of such violation, 
regardless of whether the injury occurred while such person was a minor, may sue 
in any appropriate United States District Court and shall recover the actual 
damages such person sustains and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable 
attorney's fee. Any person as described in the preceding sentence shall be deemed 
to have sustained damages of no less than $150,000 in value. 
Thus, pursuant to the deferred prosecution Agreement between the Office and Epstein, the 
Office hereby provides Notice to the identified individuals that each of them is a person who, 
while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an offense enumerated in Title 18, United States 
Code, Section 2255, committed by Epstein. The Office further provides Notice to the identified 
individuals that, pursuant to the Agreement between the Office and Epstein, a copy of this 
document may be introduced in a judicial proceeding between any such identified individual and 
Epstein, and that any judicial authority interpreting this Notification, including any authority 
determining what evidentiary burdens, if any, a plaintiff must meet, shall consider that it is the 
intent of Epstein and the Office to place the identified individuals in the same position as they 
would have been had Epstein been convicted of those federal offenses.

Hi I.- You might want to add that Epstein's publicist, Howard Rubenstein, is also the publicist for The New

Aaaargh. 
The statute of limitations issue is the state statute of limitations. I think 
says it is two years. The issue is implicated in two ways. First, 
because of the state's leniency for the first set of girls, the second set have been presented only to us for prosecution. If we cannot go 
forward, then there will be no prosecution of those crimes. (In response to the argument that in should just present them now, we believe 
that some of the victims are unknown to the defense and disclosing them further weakens our case by allowing them to depose and harass 
those victims.) 
Second, our "state resolution" of the case requires epstein to plead to something that hasn't been charged yet so further delay will allow him 
to escape one of the terms of the deal he signed several months ago. (There also is a sol on the private cause of action under 2255 pursuant 
to which he must pay damages to the girls. The delay will allow him to escape responsibility for that term, too.) 
Other reasons: 
The victims are getting older. Clearly one of epstein's arguments will be that he did not know they were minors. The older they are when 
they testify the more plausible epstein's argument becomes. 
The grand jury we are using will expire soon. We have already presented more than a dozen hours of testimony and the grand jury is 
invested and wants to indict. 
We promised the girls swift justice so they could move on with their lives. 
is a perfect example of why this is needed. The delay so 
far has led many to reach out to private lawyers which, in turn, let's e argue that they are only in it for money. 
Why give him more time? He has had more than a year's delay already for no reason other than the names of the attorneys he can afford to 
hire. This is not a white collar or other non-violent crime. This is a child exploitation crime with more than 20 known child victims. We are 
mandated by statute and doj policy to prosecute those cases vigorously and in a timely fashion - whether the children were prostitutes or 
unwilling victims. Why is this case being treated so differently?

Hey—, 
Sorry to bother you on your vacation. Apparently the DAG is inclined to allow Epstein's counsel to present further arguments. • 
has requested 
and Ito prepare, in email format, arguments to present to the DAG supporting why the case should not be 
stalled any further. 
mentioned statute of limitation issues. I don't know what the specific statute of limitations are (if there are 
any) for the various counts. Seems like the statute of limitations was for the life of the victim but I'm not certain. Other points that can be 
made include the private investigators continuing to contact the victims and the relocation of our victims to various parts of the country. 
Do you have any suggestions as to what would be our best course of persuasion? Thanks and happy travels.

Hi M. 
sent me an email about epstein wanting to do less time. I hope that his request will be denied. The original deal was 
supposed to be 2 years so he has already gotten a big break. Plus we have identified more victims since we agreed to the 18 months. Please 
keep me posted. Thanks.

Hi

I received■ e-mail stating that the DAG agreed to meet with epstein's people. Does this mean that Tuesday is off? I 
need to let the gj coordinator know. 
M
S
Also, I am sure thassimembe 
he was the person whom we initially classified as a victim until epstein's attorneys 
complained. Well,
as just in 
interviewed a girl who was 14 or 15 when she first went to epstein's house who reports that epstein told 
her that he had sex wits 
Mprobably would have been 15 or 16 when this conversation occurred.) The girl also reports that she 
told epstein her true age and epstein told her that he doesn't care about age. 
I know that epstein's people will, no doubt, continue to tell the dag and others that epstein didn't know about the girls' ages so I thought you 
should know. 
Mu
Please let me know about tuesday so I don't needlessly spoil

NOTIFICATION OF IDENTIFIED VICTIMS 
On June 30, 2008, Jeffrey Epstein (hereinafter referred to as "Epstein) entered a plea 
of guilty to violations of Florida Statutes Sections 796.07 (felony solicitation of prostitution) 
and 796.03 (procurement of minors to engage in prostitution), in the 15th Judicial Circuit in 
and for Palm Beach County (Case Nos. 2006-cf-009454AXXXMB and 2008-cf-
00938 1 AXXXMB) and was sentenced to a term of twelve months' imprisonment to be 
followed by an additional six months' imprisonment, followed by twelve months of 
Community Control 1, with conditions of community confinement imposed by the Court. 
In light of the entry of the guilty plea and sentence, the United States has agreed to 
defer federal prosecution in favor of this state plea and sentence, subject to certain 
conditions. 
One such condition to which Epstein has agreed is the following: 
"Any person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an offense 
enumerated in Title 18, United States Code, Section 2255, will have the same 
rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she would have had, if Mr. Epstein 
had been tried federally and convicted of an enumerated offense. For purposes 
of implementing this paragraph, the United States shall provide Mr. Epstein's 
attorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to name in an 
Indictment as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein. Any judicial 
authority interpreting this provision, including any authority determining 
which evidentiary burdens if any a plaintiff must meet, shall consider that it is 
the intent of the parties to place these identified victims in the same position 
as they would have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no 
less."

Facsimile: 
June 27, 2008 
Dear Messrs. Goldberger and Black: 
I write to follow up on my e-mail correspondence of June 24 and June 26, and my message 
this morning. As of 3:15 p.m., Friday, June 27, 2008, the Office still has not received a copy of a 
proposed plea agreement between Mr. Epstein and the State Attorney's Office, nor has the Office 
received notice of a date and time for a change of plea. 
As you know, the Non-Prosecution Agreement between Mr. Epstein and the Office called 
for Mr. Epstein to plead, be sentenced, and begin serving his sentence not later than January 4, 
2008-almost six months ago. The Office has continued that deadline to allow Mr. Epstein to raise 
various issues with the Department of Justice, but repeatedly advised that, once those appeals were 
completed, Mr. Epstein would need to perform the terms of the agreement within a short window 
thereafter. Now that those appeals have been exhausted, we promptly informed counsel for Mr. 
Epstein that he must enter his plea, be sentenced, and begin serving his sentence by 5:00 on Monday, 
June 30, 2008. 
This week I have sent two e-mails and left a message with Mr. Black's receptionist asking 
for the date and time of the change of plea and for a copy of the proposed plea agreement between 
Mr. Epstein and the State Attorney's Office in accordance with the terms of the Non-Prosecution 
Agreement. I have received no response to any of those requests.

I have received correspondence from counsel for a witness asking to cancel or continue the 
witness's appearance because he "understand[s] that there has been a recent development with 
respect to Mr. Epstein in that he intends to plead guilty in Florida state court on Monday pursuant 
to a deferred prosecution agreement with your office that has already been executed" and that he has 
"learned from Mr. Epstein's attorney that the plea is scheduled to take place on Monday morning." 
I also understand that there is an entry on Judge McSorley's docket that a hearing is scheduled for 
8:30 a.m. on Monday. 
Both parties have agreed that it is a material term of the Non-Prosecution Agreement that 
the United States shall have the right to review the terms of any agreements between Epstein and 
the State Attorney's Office prior to entering into those agreements. If, indeed, the change of plea 
is set for 8:30 Monday morning, the agreement with the State Attorney's Office must be provided 
to the Office by 4:30 today to allow adequate time to review and comment. Failure to provide this 
opportunity shall be deemed a breach of the Agreement. 
Accordingly, I again ask that you provide me with a copy of the Plea Agreement with the 
State Attorney's Office and notification of the date and time of the change of plea. 
Thank you. 
Sincerely, 
R. Alexander Acosta 
United States Attorney

Terms of the Agreement: 
1. 
Epstein shall plead guilty (not nob contendere) to the Indictment as 
currently pending against him in the 15th Judicial Circuit in and for 
Palm Beach County (Case No. 2006-cf-009495AVOCMB) charging 
one (1) count of solicitation of prostitution, in violation of FL Stat. § 
796.07. In addition, Epstein shall plead guilty to an Information filed 
by the State Attorney's Office charging Epstein with an offense that 
requires him to register as a sex offender, that is, the solicitation of 
minors to engage in prostitution, in violation of Florida Statutes Section 
796.03; 
2. 
Epstein shall make a binding recommendation that the Court impose a 
thirty (30) month sentence to be divided as follows: 
(a) 
Epstein shall be sentenced to consecutive tarns of twelve (12) 
months and six (6) months in county jail for all charges, without 
any opportunity for withholding adjudication or sentencing, and 
without probation or community control in lieu of 
imprisonment; and 
(b) 
Epstein shall be sentenced to a term of twelve (12) months of 
community control consecutive to his two terms in county jail 
as described in Term 2(a), supra. 
12. 
Epstein agrees that he will not be afforded any benefits with respect to 
gain time, other than the rights, opportunities, and benefits as any other 
inmate, including but not limited to, eligibility for gain time credit 
based on standard rules and regulations that apply in the State of 
Florida. At the United States' request, Epstein agrees to provide an 
accounting of the gain time he earned during his period of 
incarceration.

Hi 
- I am attaching the agreement, with addenda, for filing with the Court under seal. 
We also noticed a couple of "misstatements" during the change of plea and wanted to call them to your 
attention. First, the Division of Corporations' documents show that the Florida Science Foundation was 
incorporated in November 2007, not a "couple of years ago" as reported by Mr. Epstein. The address provided 
for the "office" of the Florida Science Foundation is Jack Goldberger's office suite, and neither the office 
building directory nor the office suite door reflects that such a business is located there, and neither the security 
guard nor any building tenant that FBI questioned knows of the existence of such a business. And, of course, 
Mr. Epstein could not have been working there "every day" when he hasn't been in Palm Beach County in the 
past six months. 
We will leave it to your discretion as to whether this should be brought to the Court's attention.

Hey we emailed MMOST:) of your comments re any further delays and added a few of our own. The US Atty Gen was here today in 
MM. I would love to know if Epstein came up. 
and Acosta were going to present to the DAG reasons not to delay any further. 
Hopefully they were successful and we r still on for Tues. We interviewed El today. She told Epstein her true age, she belvd was 14 or 15. 
Phone records show contact @ age 16. She said Epstein told her he did not care about age. She also said that' 
told her he had rad M. MI brought M. Anyways, I'll fill u in later. NY getting close to locating 
We have cell and good address. 
Keep your fingers crossed. Talk to u soon.

Aaaargh. 
The statute of limitations issue is the state statute of limitations. I think 
says it is two years. The issue is implicated in two ways. First, 
because of the state's leniency for the first set of girls, the second set have been presented only to us for prosecution. If we cannot go 
forward, then there will be no prosecution of those crimes. (In response to the argument that In should just present them now, we believe 
that some of the victims are unknown to the defense and disclosing them further weakens our case by allowing them to depose and harass 
those victims.) 
Second, our "state resolution" of the case requires epstein to plead to something that hasn't been charged yet so further delay will allow him 
to escape one of the terms of the deal he signed several months ago. (There also is a sol on the private cause of action under 2255 pursuant 
to which he must pay damages to the girls. The delay will allow him to escape responsibility for that term, too.) 
Other reasons: 
The victims are getting older. Clearly one of epstein's arguments will be that he did not know they were minors. The older they are when 
they testify the more plausible epstein's argument becomes. 
The grand jury we are using will expire soon. We have already presented more than a dozen hours of testimony and the grand jury is 
invested and wants to indict. 
We promised the girls swift justice so they could move on with their lives. 
is a perfect example of why this is needed. The delay so 
far has led many to reach out to private lawyers which, in turn, let's I argue that they are only in it for money. 
Why give him more time? He has had more than a year's delay already for no reason other than the names of the attorneys he can afford to 
hire. This is not a white collar or other non-violent crime. This is a child exploitation crime with more than 20 known child victims. We are 
mandated by statute and doj policy to prosecute those cases vigorously and in a timely fashion - whether the children were prostitutes or 
unwilling victims. Why is this case being treated so differently?

mentioned statute of limitation issues. I don't know what the specific statute of limitations are (if there are

Do you have any suggestions as to what would be our best course of persuasion? Thanks and happy travels.

Hi everyone — I still haven't heard from Roy, but in the meantime, I have been looking for correspondence that

First, as set forth below, prior to the change of plea, we informed Epstein's counsel that we took the position that 
we already have a binding agreement and that nothing further was required. (This was a June 24 e-mail) 
Dear Roy and Jack: 
I am just writing to re-state that it is the Government's position that we have a signed, binding agreement and 
that there is no need for further modification. 
Please keep us informed of the date and time of the change of plea and sentencing. 
Thank you. 
We took the same position in the e-mails thatIlland I sent to Jay Lefkowitz notifying him of Epstein's need to 
promptly perform their obligations following the various DOJ decisions. This was the language we used: 
Dear Mr. Lefkowitz: 
I understand that the Deputy Attorney General has completed his review of the Epstein matter and has 
determined that federal prosecution of Mr. Epstein's case is appropriate. 
Accordingly, Mr. Epstein has until the close of business on Monday, June 30, 2008, to comply with the terms and 
conditions of the agreement between the United States and Mr. Epstein (as modified by the U.S. Attorney's 
December 19th letter to Ms. M
CI, including entry of a guilty plea, sentencing, and surrendering to begin his 
sentence of imprisonment. 
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at the number shown below. 
(This was sent on June 23rd to Jay and June 24th to Roy.) Following this correspondence, Epstein entered his 
guilty plea. 
On June 30th, a couple of hours after the change of plea, the agents and I went to Jack Goldberger's office and 
met with Jack and Mike Tein. We provided them with the proposed Notification of Identified Victims. On the 
first page of that notice, we wrote the following: 
In light of the entry of the guilty plea and sentence, the United States has agreed to defer federal 
prosecution in favor of this state plea and sentence, subject to certain conditions. 
One such condition to which Epstein has agreed is the following: 
EFTA00013923
--- PAGE 2 ---
"Any person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an offense enumerated in 
Title 18, United States Code, Section 2255, will have the same rights to proceed under 
Section 2255 as she would have had, if Mr. Epstein had been tried federally and 
convicted of an enumerated offense. For purposes of implementing this paragraph, the 
United States shall provide Mr. Epstein's attorneys with a list of individuals whom it was 
prepared to name in an Indictment as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein. 
Any judicial authority interpreting this provision, including any authority determining 
which evidentiary burdens if any a plaintiff must meet, shall consider that it is the intent 
of the parties to place these identified victims in the same position as they would have 
been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less." 
On July 9, 2008, Jack Goldberger wrote me a letter with some objections to the Proposed Notification. Although 
he had several requests for changes, he stated: "Rather, a simple one page notification directed only to the 
recipient, and limited to the information currently on the first page of your draft memorandum would suffice." 
This, to me, is a written assent that the quoted language is, in fact, one of the conditions to which Epstein has 
agreed. So, I think that we do have a written, binding agreement comprised of the three documents that, as far as 
I know, were filed with the state court with Jack Goldberger's approval. (I am waiting to hear back from the 
ASA.) 
Here again is what I provided to the State Attorney's Office, for your records. 
<<Epstein Agrmt001.pdf>> 
I am concerned that we were adamant before Epstein's plea that we had a complete agreement and nothing more 
was necessary and now taking the position that we do not have an operative document (or set of documents). 
does the Black and Goldberger correspondence described above allay your concerns? Or would you still 
like me to raise this issue with Roy whenever he gets back to me? 
Thank you, sorry for the lengthy e-mail.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA 
CASE NO.: 08-80736-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON 
JANE DOE #1 AND JANE DOE #2, 
Petitioners, 
v. 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, 
Respondent. 
VICTIMS' RESPONSE TO GOVERNMENT'S "NOTICE TO COURT' REGARDING 
ABSENCE OF NEED FOR EVIDENTIARY HEARING" AND MOTION FOR 
PRODUCTION OF NON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENT AND OF REPORT OF 
INTERVIEW 
COME NOW the Petitioners, Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 (the "victims"), by and 
through their undersigned attorneys to file this Response to the Government's document styled as 
"Notice to Court Regarding Absence of Need for Evidentiary Hearing" as follows: 
INTRODUCTION 
At the conclusion of the oral argument on the victims' petition, victims Jane Doe #1 and 
Jane Doe #2 joined the Government in expressing to the Court a desire to work out a set of 
stipulated facts regarding this case. Towards that end, the Government sent a proposed set of 
stipulated facts to the victims' counsel (Exhibit 1 to this pleading) and, in turn, the victims' sent 
a responsive letter raising concerns about some of the Government's proposed stipulated facts 
and suggesting some additions and modifications (Exhibit 2 to this pleading). The victims also 
requested copies of two relevant documents from the Government: (1) the Non-Prosecution 
EFTA00013926

Page 2 of 16 
Agreement with defendant Epstein that is at the center of this litigation and (2) the FBI's report 
of interview concerning a meeting with Jane Doe #1. These requests were also made in several 
telephone conversations with the attorney for the Government. Remarkably, rather than respond 
to the victims' suggestions, the Government has now suddenly reversed course and filed a terse 
document claiming an "absence of a need" for an evidentiary hearing. If anything, however, the 
victims' discussions with the Government have made clear that the Court should not enter 
judgment for the Government but rather should enter immediate judgment for the victims that the 
Government violated their rights under the CVRA. The Court should then schedule a hearing to 
determine the proper remedy for the violation of the victims' rights. 
In particular, the Government now apparently admits that the Non-Prosecution 
Agreement it struck with Epstein in September 2007 contained an "express confidentiality 
provision." See Exhibit 1 to this pleading, Government's Proposed Stipulated Facts, at page 3, 
paragraph 6. Assuming that the Government honored its agreement with the defendant (a fact 
that the victims have proposed to stipulate to), the Government could not have "conferred" with 
the victims about the proposed arrangement over the next nine months because doing so would 
have violated its confidentiality obligations with the defendant. As a result, the Government 
plainly has not afforded the victims' their right to "confer" about the proposed arrangement under 
the Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA), 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(5). In addition, the Government 
effectively misled the victims that it had reached a Non-Prosecution Agreement with Epstein, 
plainly violating the victims' rights to be treated with "fairness" under the CVRA, 18 U.S.C. 
§3771(aX8). The Court should therefore find that the victims' rights have been violated. 
The Court should also order the Government to produce the Non-Prosecution Agreement 
EFTA00013927
--- PAGE 3 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM 
Document 19 
Entered on FLSD Docket 08/01/2008

to the victims. The victims are entitled to know what disposition has been made in their case. 
Moreover, that Agreement purportedly contains provisions pertaining to the civil liability of 
Epstein for crimes he has committed against Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2. Epstein obviously 
knows what those provisions are. The victims are entitled to see those provisions and the 
surrounding document as well. 
The Court should also order the Government to produce a report of interview with Jane 
Doe #1 from about October 26, 2007, during which the Government apparently claims that it 
discussed the plea arrangement with the victims. 
Finally, after these documents are produced to the victims and the Court enters judgment 
that the victims' rights have been violated, the Court should schedule a hearing to determine the 
appropriate remedy for the violations of the victims' rights. 
THE VICTIMS' PROFFERED FACTS 
The Government's latest submission takes the position that "after consideration" it is now 
unnecessary to hold an evidentiary hearing. The Government apparently believes that the Court 
could rule in its favor based on just two submitted undisputed facts. In taking this position, the 
Government apparently believes that there are no set of facts that could sustain judgment for the 
victims. To the contrary, however, the available facts require judgment for the victims that their 
rights under the CVRA have been violated. 
Having attempted to confer with the Government about the facts in this case, counsel for 
the victims respectfully submit the following — and more complete -- set of facts that, on 
information and belief, they could establish if given the opportunity to do so: 
In 2006, at the request of the Palm Beach Police Department, the Federal Bureau of

Investigation opened an investigation into allegations that Jeffrey Epstein had used facilities of 
interstate commerce to induce young girls between the ages of thirteen and seventeen to engage 
in prostitution (among other offenses). The case was presented to the United States Attorney's 
Office for the Southern District of Florida, which accepted the case for investigation. Jane Doe 
#1 and Jane Doe #2 were victims of sex crimes committed by Epstein while they were minors. 
The U.S. Attorney's Office's investigation soon revealed that Epstein had committed 
federal sex crimes against Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2. This made Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe 
#2 "victims" protected by the Crime Victim's Rights Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3771. Accordingly, the 
U.S. Attorney's Office arranged to have victim notification letters sent to Jane Doe #1 and Jane 
Doe #2. For example, on about June 7, 2007, Assistant U.S. Attorney A. Marie Villafafia sent a 
letter to Jane Doe #1 that began: "Pursuant to the [CVRA), as a victim and/or witness of a federal 
offense, you have a number of rights." The letter then listed the various rights of victims under 
the CVRA. The U.S. Attorney's Office would not have sent such a letter to Jane Doe #1 if it did 
not believe that she was a victim and was protected by the CVRA. 
By mid-2007, the U.S. Attorney's Office had ample information to file an indictment 
against Epstein charging multiple federal sex offenses. It elected not to file an indictment but 
instead to engage in pre-indictment plea discussions with Epstein. 
In September 2007, Epstein and the U.S. Attorney's Office reached an agreement 
blocking any federal prosecution of the federal offenses he had committed. 
This Non-
Prosecution Agreement barred federal charges for Epstein's sex offenses in favor of prosecution 
by Florida, so long as several preconditions were met. Those included a conviction on a state 
sex offense that reflected that the victims were minors at the time the crimes occurred and that

would require sex offender registration. 
While the Agreement barred federal criminal 
prosecution, it envisioned that the victims would pursue a civil rights action against Epstein for 
his sexual offenses against them. Most important for present purposes, the Agreement contained 
an express confidentiality provision, which prevented the Government from disclosing the terms 
of the Agreement to the victims or others before it was consummated. The Agreement was 
subsequently modified in October and December 2007. The Agreement has several addenda that 
are relevant to the Agreement. (To date, although requested to do so, the Government has 
refused to provide to the victims the final Non-Prosecution Agreement or any of its earlier 
versions.) Through his attorneys, Epstein was aware of the confidentiality provision and of the 
fact that it would block the Government from conferring with the victims about the plea 
arrangement. 
On about October 26, 2007, FBI Special Agents E. Nesbitt Kuyrkendall and Jason 
Richards met in person with Jane Doe #1 at a restaurant. The Special Agents explained that there 
had been discussions with Epstein about a possible resolution of the charges against him. 
Consistent with the express confidentiality provision in the Non-Prosecution Agreement, the 
Special Agents did not disclose that the arrangement would bar any federal prosecution of 
Epstein. Nor did the Agents disclose that the Non-Prosecution Agreement had been finalized. 
Jane Doe #1's reasonable perception of the meeting was that only the State part of the Epstein 
investigation had been resolved, and that the federal investigation would continue, possibly 
leading to a federal prosecution. (While the Government has a report of interview regarding this 
meeting with the victim that could confirm the victims' understanding of the facts, the 
Government has refused Jane Doe #1's request to see the report.)

Following the signing of the Non-Prosecution Agreement and the modifications thereto 
by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida, Epstein received an unusual 
benefit that the Government does not ordinarily provide to other criminal defendants: his 
performance was delayed while he was given an opportunity to seek higher level review within 
the Department of Justice in Washington, D.C. 
On around January 10, 2008, Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 received letters from the FBI 
advising them that "[t]his case is currently under investigation. This can be a lengthy process 
and we request you continued patience while we conduct a thorough investigation." The FBI 
sent these letters, under the direction of the U.S. Attorney's Office, because it believed that the 
CVRA applied to Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2. The FBI did not notify Jane Doe #1 or Jane 
Doe #2 that the Non-Prosecution Agreement had been concluded four months earlier. Jane Doe 
#1 and Jane Doe #2 reasonably understood that a federal criminal investigation of Epstein was 
on-going and that federal criminal charges were possibility. At the time, Jane Doe #1 and Jane 
Doe #2 believed that criminal prosecution of Epstein was extremely important. They also 
desired to be consulted by the FBI and/or other representatives of the federal government about 
the prosecution of Epstein. In light of the letters that they had received around January 10 
(among other things), they reasonably believed that they would be contacted before the federal 
government reached any final resolution of that investigation. 
In the spring 2008, Jane Doe #1 contacted the FBI because Epstein's counsel was 
attempting to take her deposition and private investigators were harassing her. Assistant U.S. 
Attorney A. Marie Villafafla secured pro bono counsel to represent Jane Doe #1 and several other 
identified victims in connection with the criminal investigation. Pro bono counsel was able to

assist Jane Doe #1 in avoiding the improper deposition. AUSA Villafana secured pro bono 
counsel by contacting Meg Garvin, Esq. of the National Crime Victims' Law Institute in 
Portland, Oregon, which is based in the Lewis & Clark College of Law. During the call, Ms. 
Garvin was not advised about the Non-Prosecution Agreement. 
In mid-June 2008, Mr. Edwards contacted Assistant U.S. Attorney Villafafia to inform her 
that he represented Jane Doe #1 and, later, Jane Doe #2. Mr. Edwards asked to meet to provide 
information about the federal crimes committed by Epstein, hoping to secure a significant federal 
indictment against Epstein. AUSA Villafafia and Mr. Edwards discussed the possibility of federal 
charges being filed. At the end of the call, AUSA Villafafia asked Mr. Edwards to send any 
information that he wanted considered by the U.S. Attorney's Office in determining whether to 
file federal charges. Because of the confidentiality provision in the Non-Prosecution Agreement, 
Mr. Edwards was not informed of the Agreement's existence. 
Mr. Edwards was also not 
informed that any resolution of the criminal matter was imminent. 
On July 3, 2008, Mr. Edwards sent to AUSA Villafafia a letter, a true and correct copy of 
which is attached as Exhibit 3. In the letter, Mr. Edwards indicated his desire that federal 
charges be filed against defendant Epstein. In particular, he wrote on behalf of his clients: "We 
urge the Attorney General and our United States Attorney to consider the fundamental import of 
the vigorous enforcement of our Federal laws. We urge you to move forward with the traditional 
indictments and criminal prosecution commensurate with the crimes Mr. Epstein has committed, 
and we further urge you to take the steps necessary to protect our children from this very 
dangerous sexual predator." When Mr. Edwards wrote this letter, he still had not been made 
aware that a Non-Prosecution Agreement had been reached with Epstein.

On about July 3, 2008, Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 learned, through telephones 
conversations had between Mr. Edwards and AUSA Villafaila, that the U.S. Attorney's Office 
and Epstein might be in the process of finalizing some sort of plea arrangement. Accordingly, 
they filed an emergency motion seeking to protect their rights under the CVRA, including in 
particular their right to confer about the proposed plea arrangement. 
Mr. Edwards — and thus his clients -- first learned of the Non-Prosecution Agreement on 
or after July 9, 2008, when the Government filed its responsive pleading to Jane Doe's 
emergency petition. That pleading was the first public mention of the non-prosecution agreement 
and the first disclosure to Mr. Edwards and his clients. Epstein, through his attorneys, knew that 
the victims had not been informed about the plea arrangement. 
On July 9, 2008, AUSA Villafafia sent a victim notification to Jane Doe #1 via her 
attorney, Mr. Edwards, which is attached as Exhibit 6 to the Villafafia Declaration. That 
notification contains a written explanation of some of the terms of the Non-Prosecution 
Agreement between Epstein and the U.S. Attorney's Office. A full copy of the terms was not 
provided. This was the first time that Jane Doe #1 was told that the arrangement blocked any 
possibility of federal criminal charges being filed against Epstein. A notification was not 
provided to Jane Doe #2 because the agreement limited Epstein's liability to victims whom the 
United States was prepared to name in an indictment. 
On July 11, 2008, the Court held a hearing on the victims' emergency motion. During the 
hearing, the Government discussed in open court various provisions of the Non-Prosecution 
Agreement. At the conclusion of the hearing, victims' counsel and the Government agreed to

confer in an effort to determine the undisputed facts of the fact. The Court took the motion under 
advisement. 
On July 16, 2008, the Government sent to Mr. Edwards a proposed set of undisputed 
facts, which is attached to this pleading as Exhibit 1. 
On July 17, 2008, Mr. Edwards sent a response to the Government, which is attached to 
this pleading as Exhibit 2. The response made various suggestions to the proposed undisputed 
facts. The response also requested a copy of the Non-Prosecution Agreement and the Report of 
Interview with Jane Doe #I. 
On July 29, 2008, rather than attempt to work with victims' counsel to draft a set of 
undisputed facts, the Government filed its "Notice to Court Regarding Absence of Need for 
Evidentiary Hearing." 
At all times material to this statement of facts, it would have been easily practical and 
feasible for the Federal Government to inform Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 of the details of any 
proposed plea agreement with Epstein, including in particular the details of the Non-Prosecution 
Agreement. The reason that AUSA Villafafia and the FBI agents acting with her did not provide 
this information to Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 was because of the express confidentiality 
provision that had been entered into by the Federal Government and Epstein. This provision 
was requested by Epstein. The Government was under no obligation to enter into such an 
arrangement and would have been statutorily forbidden from entering into such an arrangement 
by the CVRA's requirement that it "confer" with the victims about any disposition of their cases.

Page 10 of 16 
THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO CONFER WITH THE VICTIMS 
REGARDING THE UNDISPUTED FACTS OF THE CASE 
The Government should be directed to confer with the victims about the facts in this case, 
rather than allowed to obscure the facts with its proposed "notice" that an evidentiary hearing is 
unnecessary. The reason that the Government abruptly terminated discussions about the facts 
with the victims seem obvious: The facts, if revealed, would plainly demonstrate that the victims 
did not receive their right under the CVRA to confer with the Government and to be treated 
fairly. The victims will not repeat all of their arguments from their earlier pleadings but would 
simply highlight for the Court the point that this case already reeks of favored treatment for a 
billionaire sex offender who has substantial influence. Regardless of how the Court proceeds, it 
should at least do so on the basis of fully developed factual record so that the victims and the 
public can be assured that justice has been done. 
If anything, the facts in this case now call for immediate judgment in favor of the victims. 
Based on the Government's proposed stipulated facts (Exhibit 1 to this pleading), it is now 
obvious that the Government could not have fulfilled its statutory obligations to confer with the 
victims. As now admitted by the Government, in September 2007, it had entered into a Non-
Prosecution Agreement with Epstein containing what it describes as "an express confidentiality 
provision." While the Government has refused to disclose the text of this provision (or, indeed, 
the Non-Prosecution Agreement itself), it is apparent that the Government could not have 
conferred with the victims about the Agreement while abiding by the confidentiality provision. 
Likewise it is now apparent that the Government has not fulfilled its statutory obligation 
to treat the victims with fairness. The Government reached the Non-Prosecution Agreement with 
EFTA00013935
--- PAGE 11 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM 
Document 19

Page 11 of 16 
Epstein in September 2007, yet affirmatively concealed that Agreement from the victims through 
a series of misleading statements and representations over the next nine months. For example, 
on around January 10, 2008, Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 received letters from the FBI advising 
them that "[t]his case is currently under investigation. This can be a lengthy process and we 
request your continued patience while we conduct a thorough investigation." As the Government 
well knew, however, a Non-Prosecution Agreement had already been reached with Epstein at that 
time — a fact not disclosed in the letter. 
The victims therefore request judgment in their favor that their rights under the CVRA 
have been violated. 
In the alternative, the victims request that the Court direct that the 
Government confer in good faith with the victims to attempt to reach a set of stipulated facts that 
might form the basis for a final ruling in this case. As part of this conference, the victims request 
that the Government indicate which (if any) of the proposed facts set forth above it disputes. 
THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO PRODUCE 
THE NON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENT 
Remarkably, the Government has yet to disclose to the victims the very Non-Prosecution 
Agreement that lies at the heart of this case. This failure becomes even more curious when 
assessed against the Government's proposed stipulation of facts, which included the proposed 
fact that the victims had been told about the "full terms" of the Agreement. The proposed 
stipulated facts that the Government sent to the victims included this proposed stipulation: 
On July 9, 2008, AUSA Villafafia sent a victim notification to Jane Doe #1 via her 
attorney, Bradley Edwards, which is attached as Exhibit 6 to the Villafafia 
Declaration. That notification contains a written explanation of the full terms of 
the agreement between Epstein and the U.S. Attorney's Office. 
Contrary to its own proposed stipulation, the Government has never disclosed to the victims the 
EFTA00013936
--- PAGE 12 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM 
Document 19 
Entered on FLSD Docket 08/01/2008 
Page 12 of 16 
"full terms" of its Non-Prosecution Agreement with Epstein. To protect the victims' right to be 
treated with fairness, 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(8), it should be required to do so now. 
Congress' main concern in passing the CVRA was that crime victims were "treated as 
non-participants in a critical event in their lives. They were kept in the dark by prosecutors too 
busy to care enough ... and by a court system that simply did not have a place for them." 150 
CONG. REC. 54262 (Apr. 22, 2004) (statement of Sen. Feinstein). To remedy this problem, 
Congress gave victims "the simple right to know what is going on, to participate in the process 
where the information that victims and their families can provide may be material and relevant ... 
." Id. To date, Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 do not know what has happened to their case, 
because they have not been told how it has been resolved. Of course, no possible harm to the 
Government can come from the release of the Agreement, as this criminal matter is now 
concluded — at least from the Government's perspective. 
Production of the Non-Prosecution Agreement is also warranted because it has provisions 
in it that are designed to benefit Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2. As described by the Government, 
the Agreement contains provisions in it that preclude Epstein from contesting civil liability for 
the sex offenses committed against a number of the victims, including Jane Doe # I. Obviously, 
Jane Doe #1 cannot take advantage of this provision if her attorneys are not able to review it. 
Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 intend to file civil suits against Epstein within the next few days. 
Epstein knows what is in the Non-Prosecution Agreement that may be helpful to him. Jane Doe 
# I and Jane Doe #2 are entitled to see the Agreement for items that may be helpful to them. 
Finally, Epstein is apparently taking advantage of provisions in the Non-Prosecution 
Agreement to stall civil suits against him. For example, in Jane Doe v. Epstein et at, No. 08-
EFTA00013937
--- PAGE 13 ---

Document 19

Page 13 of 16 
80804-MARRA/JOHNSON (S.D. Fla. 2008), on July 25, 2008, Epstein filed a motion for a stay. 
That motion claims that the civil action is "a counterpart to a pending federal criminal action." 
The basis for that claim, so far as Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 can tell, is the federal Non-
Prosecution Agreement. Epstein should not be permitted to use provisions in the Agreement to 
his advantage in private litigation without disclosing those provisions to the parties he is 
opposing. Indeed, as a simple matter of fairness to the victims, see 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(5) 
(victims right to "fairness"), the provisions should be disclosed. 
In sum, the Court should direct the Government to reveal to the victims what it has done 
to resolve the case by ordering production of the full Non-Prosecution Agreement and any 
accompanying addenda to the agreement. 
THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO PRODUCE THE REPORT OF 
INTERVIEW WITH JANE DOE #1 
The Government apparently has a report of interview indicating that two named FBI 
agents met with Jane Doe #1 on about October 26, 2007. The Government, however, has 
declined to produce it. 
The Government should be directed to produce this information to Jane Doe #1. Of 
course, a criminal defendant would be entitled to such a report. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(1)(A) 
& (B). As an innocent victim in this matter, Jane Doe #1 should be treated with at least the same 
consideration. See 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(8) (victim's right to "be treated with fairness"). Jane 
Doe #1 requested this report in her letter regarding the proposed stipulated facts (see Exhibit 2 to 
this filing), a request that the Government has simply ignored.

AFTER ENTERING JUDGMENT FOR THE VICTIMS' ON THE VIOLATION OF THEIR 
RIGHTS, THE COURT SHOULD SCHEDULE A HEARING ON THE APPROPRIATE 
REMEDY 
For the reasons just explained, the Court should enter judgment for Jane Doe #1 and Jane 
Doe #2 on the violations of their rights under the CVRA and order the Government to produce 
the Non-Prosecution Agreement and the report of interview with Jane Doe #1. After doing that, 
the question then arises as to what is the proper remedy for the violations of victims' rights. 
To be clear, at this time, the victims seek two things: (1) a judicial declaration that the 
Government violated their rights under the CVRA and an apology from the Government; and (2) 
a hearing to discuss the appropriate remedy under the circumstances. At the same time, the 
victims are not asking to have any provision in the Non-Prosecution Agreement establishing 
liability in a civil suit to be vacated or declared invalid. 
Because the possible connection 
between these two things raises complex legal issues, the victims respectfully request that the 
Court order a hearing at which the appropriate remedy can be discussed. The victims also need 
to review the full text of the Non-Prosecution Agreement and any accompanying addenda to 
make an appropriate determination about the remedy that they wish to pursue. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court should find that the Government violated Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2's 
rights under the CVRA to confer and to be treated with fairness during the negotiation and 
consummation of the Non-Prosecution Agreement. In the alternative, the Court should direct the 
Government to confer with the victims regarding what facts are undisputed in this matter and, 
should material facts actually be disputed, hold an evidentiary hearing regarding those facts. So 
that the victims can discuss these matters with the Government, the Court should order the

Government to provide to the victims the full Non-Prosecution Agreement (and accompanying 
addenda) that is central to this litigation as well as a report of interview with Jane Doe #1 from 
about October 26, 2007. The Court should then hold a hearing on the proper remedy for the 
violations of the victims' rights.

Subject: RE: Draft Protective Order 
This is my proposed Order. I think it comports with the Judge's order from yesterday and I think it is slightly more 
thorough. It is very similar to your Motion. If you are more satisfied with your wording or layout for the motion, then please 
incorporate the additional points made in my proposed order. 
My only real problem with your proposed Order is paragraph C. This just further delays us from getting the agreement, and 
I do not believe the Judge placed this burden on us. I think, as I wrote in my proposed order, that it is my duty to instruct 
my clients on the protective order and its function and to otherwise ensure that it is not violated by my clients. Getting my 
clients to "acknowledge receipt of the order and agree to its terms" could take awhile and cause unnecessary delay. I plan 
to talk to my clients about "the agreement" and at the same time instruct them as to the rules outlined in the protective 
order. That is all the Judge indicated as needed to be done.

Re: Jeffrey Epstein-: 
AMENDED NOTIFICATION OF 
IDENTIFIED VICTIM 
Dear Mr. Dutko: 
By virtue of this letter, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of 
Florida asks that you provide the following amended notice to 
t, 
Some 
of the information contained in the July 20, 2008 letter to Ms. was 
inaccurate, so please 
advise her of the following changes. 
As you were previously advised, on June 30, 2008, Jeffrey Epstein (hereinafter referred to 
as "Epstein) entered a plea of guilty to violations of Florida Statutes Sections 796.07 (felony 
solicitation of prostitution) and 796.03 (procurement of minors to engage in prostitution), in the 
15th Judicial Circuit in and for Palm Beach County (Case Nos. 2006-cf-009454AXX.XMB and 
2008-cf-009381AXXXMB) and was sentenced to a term of twelve months' imprisonment to be 
followed by an additional six months' imprisonment, followed by twelve months of Community 
Control 1, with conditions of community confinement imposed by the Court. 
In light of the entry of the guilty plea and sentence, the United States has agreed to defer 
federal prosecution in favor of this state plea and sentence, subject to certain conditions, 
including the following: 
1. An independent Special Master was assigned the task of selecting an attorney 
representative to represent the victims in connection with civil litigation between 
the victims and Mr. Epstein. The Special Master selected Robert Josefsberg, Esq. 
of the firm Podhurst Orseck, P.A., a highly-respected and experienced attorney. 
Ms. 
is not obligated to use Mr. Josefsberg as her civil attorney, but, as 
explained in 
eater detail below, Mr. Josefsberg's services will be provided at no 
cost to Ms. 
'ecause Mr. Epstein is obligated to pay the costs and fees of the 
attorne -representative. Also, Mr. Epstein and his attorneys can only contact Ms. 
is Mr. Josefsberg, assuming that she would like Mr. Josefsberg to serve as 
her attorni 
2. If Ms. 
elects to file suit against Mr. Epstein pursuant to Title 18, United 
States Code, Section 2255, Mr. Epstein will not contest the jurisdiction of the 
United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida over his person 
and/or the subject matter, and Mr. Epstein waives his right to contest liability and 
also waives his right to contest damagesantn amount as agreed to between Ms. 
and Mr. Epstein, so long as Ms. 
elects to proceed exclusively under 
U.S.C. § 2255, and she waives any other claim for damages, whether pursuant to 
state, federal, or common law. Notwithstanding this waiver, Epstein's agreement 
EFTA00013947
--- PAGE 2 ---
with the United States, his waivers and failure to contest liability and such damages 
in any suit are not to be construed as an admission of any criminal or civil liability. 
3. As stated above, Mr. Epstein has agreed to pay the fees of the attorney 
representative selected by the independent third party. This provision, however, 
shall not obligate Epstein to pay the fees and costs of contested liti ation filed 
against him. Thus, if after consideration of potential settlements, Ms. 
and 
Mr. Josefsberg elect to file a contested lawsuit pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2255 or she 
elects to pursue any other contested remedy, the obligation to pay the costs of the 
attorney representative, as opposed to any statutory or other obligations to pay 
reasonable attorneys fees and costs such as those contained in Section 2255 to bear 
the costs of the attorney representative, shall cease. 
Mr. Josefsberg will be conta tin 
ou within the next week to explain these terms and to 
determine if he may contact Ms. 
irectly. If you would like to contact Mr. Josefsberg 
directly, he can be reached at
If Ms. 
has selected other counsel to represent her, or if she does so in the future, 
and she decides to pursue a claim against Jeffrey Epstein, his attorney, Jack Goldberger, asks that 
he be contacted at Atterbury Goldberger and Weiss, 250 Australian Avenue South, Suite 1400, 
West Palm Beach, FL 33401. 
In addition, a judge has ordered that the United States make available to any designated 
victim (and/or her attorney) a copy of the actual agreement between Mr. Epstein and the United 
States, so long as the victim (and/or her attorney reviews, signs, and agrees to be bound by a 
Protective Order entered by the Court. If Ms. 
would like to review the Agreement, 
please let me know, and I will forward a copy of the rotective Order for her signature. 
As I stated in my earlier notification, please understand that neither the U.S. Attorney's 
Office nor the Federal Bureau of Investigation can take part in or otherwise assist in civil 
litigation, but we again thank you and your client for all of her assistance during the course of 
this investigation.

Re: Jeffrey Epstein 
Dear Jay and Roy: 
Thank you for your response to my earlier letter. The U.S. Attorney's Office shares in 
your desire to implement all of the terms of the Non-Prosecution Agreement. As you are aware, 
the jointly-approved Special Master, Judge Davis, has already selected an attorney representative, 
Robert Josefsberg, who was accepted by both parties. The Office has conferred with Mr. 
Josefsberg, who has agreed to continue in that role. In October 2007, Mr. Josefsberg expended 
time, effort, and funds in preparing to serve as the attorney representative, and he will need a 
written confirmation from you that his future fees and expenses will be paid in accordance with 
the terms of the Non-Prosecution Agreement. 
Please provide me with a copy of that 
correspondence for my file. 
With that matter settled, I believe that the requirement for a joint written submission to the 
Special Master has been extinguished. Nonetheless, I have no objection to attempting to create a 
joint statement to assist Mr. Josefsberg in serving his duties. Regarding your suggestion that we 
ask Judge Davis to "offer the final word on how certain clauses should be interpreted and 
satisfied," I believe that the Agreement speaks for itself and any ambiguities that you perceive 
will be resolved with litigation with the intended third-party beneficiaries, i.e. , the listed victims. 
In light of the ongoing litigation between the United States and two of the victims, I am 
concerned that efforts to modify or even interpret the Agreement will require consultation with 
all of the victims, which will be unwieldy and extremely time consuming. 
As to your other points, I am happy to revert to the shorter list that was prepared as of the 
signing of the Non-Prosecution Agreement in September 2007, so long as the United States may 
proceed to prosecute your client for those victims identified after that date. If your position is 
that the Agreement covers all crimes related to victims known to the United States as of June 30, 
2008, then all of those victims should be entitled to compensation. Please advise me of your 
client's election by Friday morning so that the appropriate revised victim notifications may be 
distributed and I can prepare the final victim list. 
Copies of the victim notifications will continue to be provided to counsel for Mr. Epstein. 
Please let me know whether I should continue to list Mr. Goldberger as the point of contact for 
the civil litigation. Regarding your suggestion on the content of the notification letters, I intend 
to use the same format that was used in the letters previously approved by Messrs. Goldberger 
EFTA00013949
--- PAGE 2 ---
and Tein, except that I will include the language from the September and October agreements. I 
have enclosed a draft herewith. Because I previously provided the victims with incorrect 
information—albeit with the approval of Mr. Epstein's counsel—it is imperative that I correct the 
error promptly. Accordingly, if you have any substantive objections to the letter, please advise 
me by tomorrow afternoon.

I'm working on a story about the federal non-prosecution agreement that is part and parcel of the state plea 
agreement with Jeffrey Epstein. 
I'd like to know why the U.S. Attorney's Office decided not to prosecute Epstein - because I do know, according to 
court records, that if he violates any portion of his state agreement that he can be federally prosecuted. 
I wanted to know if I could speak with AUSA 
for an answer to this question, since she was the AUSA 
on the case. 
I am on deadline for today.

2, 2008. Please be advised that we strenuously object to your letters on various grounds, and believe 
that they arc in violation of the Florida Bar Rules. 
First, your letters attempt to steer the victims to a particular attorney, Mr. Josefsberg, and 
advise them that Mr. Josefsberg will be making an unsolicited contact to them in the next two weeks. 
This contact with prospective clients and solicitation reflected in your letters is contrary to Fla. Bar. 
Rule 4-7.4. Additionally, your letters are misleading in the following respects: (1) the action 
advocated to the victims in paragraph 2 refers generally to the victims' waiver o f "any other claim for 
damages", failing to advise them that this waiver may include a valuable claim to punitive damages 
against an alleged billionaire; and (2) the letters imply in paragraph 3 that Mr. Epstein's agreement to 
pay attorney fccs is a significant concession, when in fact a victim is entitled to reasonable attorneys' 
fees under the Statute upon proof of a violation, irrespective of Mr. Epstein's agreement. 
We accordingly demand that the U.S. Attorneys' office immediately cease and desist from 
directing unrepresented victims into unsolicited attorney contacts and misleading them about their 
rights in claims against Mr. Epstein. We demand that you instruct Mr. Josefsberg not to solicit 
victims, and to send letters to unrepresented victims correcting the misleading statements contained 
in your September 2, 2008 letters.

Hi 1M— I am attaching the agreement, with addenda, for filing with the Court under seal. 
We also noticed a couple of "misstatements" during the change of plea and wanted to call them to your 
attention. First, the Division of Corporations' documents show that the Florida Science Foundation was 
incorporated in November 2007, not a "couple of years ago" as reported by Mr. Epstein. The address provided 
for the "office" of the Florida Science Foundation is Jack Goldberger's office suite, and neither the office 
building directory nor the office suite door reflects that such a business is located there, and neither the security 
guard nor any building tenant that FBI questioned knows of the existence of such a business. And, of course, 
Mr. Epstein could not have been working there "every day" when he hasn't been in Palm Beach County in the 
past six months. 
We will leave it to your discretion as to whether this should be brought to the Court's attention.

Dear= 
I just wanted to let you know that 
and I spoke with Roy Black yesterday regarding the Epstein case. Roy 
asked whether there was a way to resolve the federal and state litigation simultaneously and mentioned your 
desire to wrap up the case before you retired. We informed him that the Office's position is that if Epstein 
promptly abides by the terms of the signed non-prosecution agreement entered into by the Office and Mr. 
Epstein, we will end our investigation. If Mr. Epstein chooses to go forward with a different plea in the State, 
that is his prerogative, but we will consider it a breach of the federal non-prosecution agreement and will proceed 
accordingly. 
The federal non-prosecution agreement signed by Mr. Epstein and his counsel requires Mr. Epstein to plead 
guilty to the current state indictment and also to an information charging a state offense that requires sex offender 
registration, specifically the charge of procuring minors to engage in prostitution, at least 18 months 
imprisonment, and an agreement that the victims can pursue damages claims as though Mr. Epstein had been 
convicted of the federal offenses. Our agreement does not address probationary periods following the term of 
incarceration. Those are statutorily set on the federal side, so we have left that issue to the defense to negotiate 
with you. 
If you have any questions, please let me know.

Hi 
Yes an agreement has been signed and has already been partially performed. The agreement is confidential and has been filed 
under seal in the state court proceedings. 
He could be filing his motion on behalf of 3 different Jane does= Was not fully identified until after the agreement was signed 
was notified and her notification resulted in claims of prosecutorial misconduct by Epstein's lawyers. I am checking to see if the third, 
was notified prior to the signing of the agreement.

Hi■— I just got an earful from the last of the victims' lawyers. He is a former Broward County ASA and he 
represents three victims. He says that his clients can name many more victims and wanted to know if we can get 
out of the deal. I told him that, at this time, assuming that Epstein performs the last piece of the agreement, we 
are bound. He asked that, if there is the slightest hesitation on Epstein's part of completing his performance, that 
he and his clients be allowed to consult with our office before making a decision. 
I also couldn't remember if I told you about our meeting with the Sheriff's Office about the jail. Epstein is out at 
the stockade, not the jail. Goldberger and some psychiatrist have already met with him and have told him that, if 
he receives any less favorable treatment than others, Ken Starr and the whole crew will sue. He also told me that 
Epstein was "brilliant" and that he has already offered to teach GED classes. I sort of cocked my head at the 
"brilliant" comment and said, you know he only has a high school diploma, right? (I used my best, "don't 
believe the hype" voice. He was clearly shocked, and I explained that Epstein usually claims to have at least a 
master's degree, but other than a few college courses, he had no education above a high school diploma, which I 
think makes him ineligible to teach a GED course.) He also told us that Epstein is eligible for work release and 
will be placed on work release — in direct contradiction to what he told the agents a few months ago.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA 
CASE NO.: 
IN RE: JANE DOE, 
Petitioner. 
VICTIM'S PETITION FOR ENFORCEMENT OF 
CRIME VICTIM'S RIGHTS ACT, 18 U.S.0 . SECTION 3771 
COMES NOW the Petitioner, JANE DOE (hereinafter "Petitioner"), by and through her 
undersigned attorneys, pursuant to the Crime Victim's Rights Act, 18 U.S.C. Section 3771 
("CVRA"), and files this Petition for Enforcement in the above styled action as follows: 
1. 
Petitioner, an adult, as a minor child was a victim of federal crimes committed by 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN (hereinafter "Defendant"). 
These crimes included sex trafficking of 
children by fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591, use of a means of interstate commerce to 
entice a minor to commit prostitution, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2422, as well as wire fraud, in 
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1343. The Defendant committed these crimes within the jurisdiction of 
the Southern District of Florida in Palm Beach County, Florida. 
2. 
Upon information and belief, the Defendant is the subject of a federal criminal 
investigation conducted by the United States of America in the Southern District of Florida. The 
Defendant has recently been prosecuted and pleaded guilty, on June 30, 2008, in the Circuit 
Court for Palm Beach County to various similar state offenses including solicitation of minors 
for prostitution. 
3. 
Upon information and belief, the Defendant is engaged in plea negotiations with 
the Office of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida concerning federal 
i 
EFTA00013976
--- PAGE 2 ---
crimes which he is alleged to have committed against minor children, including the Petitioner. 
Such negotiations may likely result in a disposition of the charges in the next several days. 
4. 
Under the CVRA, before any charges are filed against the Defendant, the 
Petitioner has the rights (among others) to notice of her rights under the CVRA, to confer with 
the prosecutors, and to be treated with fairness. As soon as charges are filed, the Petitioner has 
the rights (among others) to timely notice of court proceedings, the right not to be excluded from 
such proceedings, the right to be heard at such public proceedings regarding conditions of 
release, any plea, and any sentence, the right to confer with the attorney for the government, the 
right to restitution, and the right to be treated with fairness and with respect for her dignity and 
privacy. 
5. 
The Petitioner has been denied her rights in that she has received no consultation 
with the attorney for the government regarding the possible disposition of the charges, no notice 
of any public court proceedings, no information regarding her right to restitution, and no notice 
of rights under the CVRA, as required under law. 
6. 
The Petitioner is in jeopardy of losing her rights, as described above, if the 
government is able to negotiate a plea or agreement with the Defendant without her participation 
and knowledge. 
WHEREFORE, for the reasons outlined above, the Petitioner respectfully requests this 
Court to grant her Petition, and to order the United States Attorney to comply with the provisions 
of the CVRA prior to and including any plea or other agreement with the Defendant and any 
attendant proceedings.

MEMORANDUM 
I. 
THE CRIME VICTIMS' RIGHTS ACT MAKES CRIME VICTIMS 
INDEPENDENT 
PARTICIPANTS 
THROUGHOUT 
THE 
CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROCESS. 
In October 2004, Congress passed and the President signed into law the Crime Victims' 
Rights Act, Pub. L. No. 108-405, 118 Stat. 2251 (codified at 18 U.S.C. § 3771). Because this 
appears to be the first case involving the Act to come before this Court, a bit of background may 
be in order. 
A. 
The CVRA Gives Crime Victims Rights to Participate in the Criminal Justice 
Process. 
Congress passed the CVRA "to give crime victims enforceable rights to participate in 
federal criminal proceedings." Opinion at 14. Congress was concerned that in the federal system 
crime victims were "treated as non-participants in a critical event in their lives. They were kept 
in the dark by prosecutors too busy to care enough ... and by a court system that simply did not 
have a place for them." 150 CONG. REC. S4262 (Apr. 22, 2004) (statement of Sen. Feinstein). 
To remedy this problem, Congress gave victims "the simple right to know what is going on, to 
participate in the process where the information that victims and their families can provide may 
be material and relevant ... ." Id. 
The CVRA gives victims of federal crimes a series of rights, including the right to notice 
of court proceedings, to be heard at plea and sentencing hearings, and to reasonably "confer with 
the attorney for the Government in the case." 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a). Victims also have a "right 
of access to the terms of a plea agreement ... ." In re Interested Party 1, 530 F.Supp. 2d 136, 
2008 WL 134233 at *7 (D.D.C. 2008). The CVRA also assures victims broadly that they will 
"be treated with fairness." 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(8). 
EFTA00013978
--- PAGE 4 ---
Of course, these rights would be of little use to most crime victims unless they were told 
about them. To ensure that victims are notified of their rights, the CVRA directs employees of 
the Justice Department "and other departments and agencies of the United States engaged in the 
detection, investigation, or prosecution of crime" to use their "best efforts to see that crime 
victims are notified of... the rights described [in the CVRA]." 18 U.S.C. § 3771(c)(l) (emphasis 
added).1 
B. 
The CVRA Gives Victims Rights During the Investigation of a Crime. 
The CVRA gives victims rights during the investigation of a crime. The Fifth Circuit 
recently reached this conclusion, holding: 
The district court acknowledged that "[t]here are clearly rights 
under the CVRA that apply before any prosecution is underway." 
BP Prods., 2008 WL 501321 at *11, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12893, 
at *36. Logically, this includes the CVRA's establishment of 
victims' "reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the 
Government." 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(5). At least in the posture of 
this case (and we do not speculate on the applicability to other 
situations), the government should have fashioned a reasonable 
way to inform the victims of the likelihood of criminal charges and 
to ascertain the victims' views on the possible details of a plea 
bargain. 
In re Dean, 527 F.3d 391, 394 (5'h Cir. 2008). 
The position that CVRA rights apply before charges have been filed is consistent with the 
Justice Department regulations under the CVRA, which explain that government officials "must 
advise a victim [about their rights under the CVRA] ... at the earliest opportunity at which it may 
be done without interfering with an investigation." A.G. GUIDELINES FOR VICTIM AND WITNESS 
Further supporting this requirement is another statute, 42 U.S.C. § 10607(c)(3), which directs government officials 
to provide victims with "the earliest possible notice of," among other things, "the filing of charges against a 
suspected offender." 
EFTA00013979
--- PAGE 5 ---
ASSISTANCE 23 (May 2005). And the plain language of the CVRA undergirds this conclusion, as 
it applies not simply to prosecutors but to government agencies "engaged in the detection [and] 
investigation ... of crime ... ." 18 U.S.C. § 3771(c)(1). Indeed, if there were any doubt, the plain 
language of the CVRA extends victims' right to situations "in which no prosecution is 
underway." 18 U.S.C. § 3771(d)(3). 
II. 
PETITIONER IS A "VICTIM PROTECTED BY THE CVRA. 
Under the CVRA the crime victim is defined as "a person directly and proximately 
harmed as a result of the commission of a Federal offense ... ." 18 U.S.C. Section 3771(e). 
In 
particular, Defendant called Petitioner when she was a minor over a telephone (a means of 
interstate communication) requesting that she perform a massage in exchange for payment. As 
Defendant well knew, that request was fraudulent, as he not only intended to receive a massage, 
but also intended to have her perform sexual acts in exchange for a cash payment to Petitioner. 
Only when Petitioner arrived at a Defendant's mansion as directed by Defendant, did Defendant 
reveal his true purpose of obtaining sexual favors in exchange for payment. This conduct 
violated 18 U.S.C. § 2422, which forbids using a means of interstate commerce to knowingly 
"induce" or "entice" a minor "to engage in prostitution." In addition, this conduct was both a use 
of "fraud" to obtain a commercial sex act, in violation of 18 U.S.0 § 1591, and use of wire 
communications to perpetrate a "scheme and artifice to defraud," in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 
1343. 
It appears obvious that Petitioner was "directly and proximately" harmed by these crimes, 
thereby making her a victim under the CVRA. It should be emphasized that the CVRA "was 
designed to be a `broad and encompassing' statutory victims' bill of rights." United States v. 
EFTA00013980
--- PAGE 6 ---
Degenhardt, 405 F.Supp.2d 1341, 1342 (D. Utah 2005) (quoting 150 Cong. Rec. S4261 (daily 
ed. Apr. 22, 2004) (statement of Sen. Feinstein)). Congress intended the CVRA to dramatically 
rework the federal criminal justice system. In the course of construing the CVRA generously, the 
Ninth Circuit observed: "The criminal justice system has long functioned on the assumption that 
crime victims should behave like good Victorian children -- seen but not heard. The Crime 
Victims' Rights Act sought to change this by making victims independent participants in the 
criminal justice process." Kenna v. U.S. Dist. Court for C.D. Cal., 435 F.3d 1011, 1013 (9th Cir. 
2006). 
Accordingly, because the CVRA is remedial legislation, courts should interpret it 
"liberally to facilitate and accomplish its purposes and intent." 
Elliott Industries Ltd. 
Partnership v. BP America Production Co., 407 F.3d 1091, 1118 (10th Cir. 2005) (noting 
remedial legislation should be "interpreted liberally to facilitate and accomplish its purposes and 
intent"). The CVRA itself suggests this conclusion by requiring that courts must treat crime 
victims with "fairness." United States v. Patkar, 2008 WL 233062 at •3 (D. Haw. 2008) (citing 
United States v. Turner, 367 F.Supp.2d 319, 335 (E.D.N.Y. 2005)). 
Not only must the CVRA as a whole be interpreted liberally, but its definition of "crime 
victim" requires a generous construction. After reciting the direct-and-proximate-harm language 
at issue here, one of the Act's two co-sponsors -- Senator Kyl -- explained that "[t]his is an 
intentionally broad definition because all victims of crime deserve to have their rights protected 
." 150 Cong. Rec. 510912 (Oct. 9, 2004) (emphasis added). The description of the victim 
definition as "intentionally broad" was in the course of floor colloquy with the other primary 
sponsor of the CVRA and therefore deserves significant weight. See Kenna, 435 F.3d at 1015-16 
(discussing significance of CVRA sponsors= floor statements). 
EFTA00013981
--- PAGE 7 ---
The definition of "crime victims" must thus be construed broadly in favor of Petitioner. 
She obviously qualifies as a "victim" under the CVRA. 
III. 
PETITIONER IS ENTITLED TO NOTICE OF HER RIGHTS, AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO CONFER WITH THE PROSECUTORS AND 
TO BE TREATED WITH FAIRNESS. 
Because Petitioner is a "victim" under the CVRA, she has certain protected rights under 
the Act. Most important, the Act promises that she will have an opportunity to "confer with the 
attorney for the Government in the case." To date, Petitioner has not been given that right. This 
raises that very real possibility that the Government may negotiate and conclude a plea agreement 
with the Defendant without giving Petitioner her protected rights.2 
Petitioner is entitled to have this conference with prosecutors before any final plea 
agreement is reached. The Fifth Circuit reached exactly this conclusion in a very recent case. In 
In re Dean, 527 F.3d 391 (5th Cir. 2008), the Government negotiated a plea agreement with the 
well-heeled corporate defendant without conferring with the victims. When the Government's 
failure was challenged in the Fifth Circuit, the Fifth Circuit concluded that the Government had 
indeed violated the CVRA. The Fifth Circuit observed: "In passing the [CVRA], Congress 
made the policy decision-which we are bound to enforce-that the victims have a right to inform 
the plea negotiation process by conferring with prosecutors before a plea agreement is reached." 
Id. at 394. 
This Court is obligated to protect the rights of Petitioner. The CVRA directs that "[i]n 
any court proceeding involving an offense against a crime victim, the court shall ensure that the 
On information and belief, roughly the same crimes were committed against several other young females. These 
victims, too, are in danger of losing their right to confer under the CVRA. 
EFTA00013982
--- PAGE 8 ---
crime victim is afforded the rights described in [the CVRA]." 18 U.S.C. § 3771(b)(1). The 
CVRA also confers on crime victims the right to "assert the rights described in [the CVRA]." 18 
U.S.C. § 3771(d)(1). Therefore, this Court has its own independent obligation to intercede and 
ensure that the Government respects the rights of Petitioner under the CVRA. 
CONCLUSION 
The Petitioner requests the intervention of this Court to ensure that her rights are 
respected and accorded, as promised in the Crime Victims' Rights Act.

Esq. 
Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General 
Office of the Deputy Attorney General 
United States De . artment of Justice 
Dear Mr. 
Facsimile: 
Dir. Fax
I again want to thank you for this opportunity to explain why we believe that a federal 
prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein is unwarranted. I appreciate your having informed us that you 
already have our May 19 and May 27 communications to the Deputy Attorney General, as well 
as our prior written submissions to CEOS and to the Southern District of Florida. 
In light of the significant volume of our prior submissions and to facilitate your review, 
we have drafted four supplemental submissions that will provide a roadmap for your 
investigation of this matter. Given the bulk of these documents and their appended supporting 
attachments, you will receive this packet by messenger tomorrow. A brief description of each of 
the four submissions follows. First, I have included a succinct summary of the facts, law and 
policy issues at hand. This document sets forth a basic overview of the issues and summarizes 
our principal contentions as to why federal prosecution of this matter is neither appropriate nor 
warranted. 
The three other submissions include: a summary of the irregularities and misconduct that 
occurred during the federal investigation; a letter from former CEOS attorney 
that responds to CEOS's assessment of its limited rev
's case; and a point-by-
point rebuttal to First Assistant United States Attorney 
recent letter which we 
believe contains factual inaccuracies typical of our correspondence from the United States 
Attorney's Office in Miami (the "USAO"). Also, for your reference, the package you receive 
tomorrow will contain a binder including all documentation to which we refer in our 
submissions. Finally, we will be providing a detailed checklist of each submission or substantive 
communication to the USAO. Our intention is that you have copies of each such document to 
enhance your review. If there are any that you have not received from the USAO or CEOS, 
please advise and we will fedex them to you without delay.

As you are likely aware, the Department's prior review of this matter was incomplete 
and, by its own admission, not "de novo." See Tab 38, May 15, 2008 Letter from A. Oosterbaan. 
Without considering the Non Prosecution Agreement that left this matter to be resolved in the 
State or any of the misconduct, CEOS reviewers, tasked with reviewing some of their own 
previously expressed opinions, assessed only whether the United States Attorney would "abuse 
[his] discretion" if he pursued this case. While we appreciate CEOS's willingness to examine 
these limited issues, its conclusion that a prosecution would not be an "abuse of discretion" rings 
particularly hollow in light of CEOS's admirably candid concessions that we have raised 
"compelling" objections and that a prosecution on these facts would require "novel" applications 
of federal law. Indeed, even a brief review of CEOS's own mission statement reveals how 
inapposite a federal prosecution is to the facts in this case. 
Importantly, we note that the CEOS review was conducted prior to the Supreme Court's 
very recent decisions in Santos and Cuellar, which we believe—illuminating as they do the 
Court's interpretive methodology when it comes to federal criminal law—powerfully 
demonstrate the substantive vulnerability of the USAO's unprecedented employment of three 
federal laws. That Office's interpretation would never pass muster under the Supreme Court's 
recent pronouncements and should not be countenanced. That is all the more true under the 
circumstances where the duly appointed U.S. Attorney opined that, in effect, the "unitary" 
Executive Branch was driving this prosecution. We now know that is not so. 
What I respectfully request, and what I hope you will provide, is a truly "de novo" 
review that is, an independent assessment of whether federal prosecution of Mr. Epstein is both 
necessary and warranted in view of the legal and evidentiary hurdles that have been identified, 
the existence of a State felony plea and sentence that have been advocated by the State Attorney 
for Palm Beach County, and the many issues of prosecutorial misconduct and overzealousness 
that have permeated the investigation. I also request that you provide us with the opportunity 
during your review to meet with you in person to answer any questions you may have and to 
elucidate some of the issues in our submission. 
We believe that an independent review will confirm our strong belief that federal 
prosecutors would be required to stretch the plain meaning of each element of the enumerated 
statutes, and then to combine these distorted elements in a tenuous chain, in order to convict Mr. 
Epstein. Indeed, just this week iatu
fter two years of federal involvement in this matter), 
Assistant United States Attorney 
re-initiated the federal grand jury investigation—in 
direct contravention of the parties' Non Prosecution Agreement—and issued yet another 
subpoena seeking evidence in this case. See Tab 19, Subpoena to 
In the 
subpoena, AUSA 
directs 
to appear on July 1, 2008 to give testimony 
and produce documents to FGJ 07-103 West Palm Beach. The attachment to the subpoena seeks 
documents such as photographs, emails, telephone billing information, and contact information 
that relate to Mr. Epstein as well as specific other people who received protection from federal 
EFTA00013990

prosecution as a result of Mr. Epstein's having entered into the September 24, 2007 Non 
Prosecution Agreement with the USAO. 
Notably, the Non Prosecution Agreement contains the following agreed condition: 
Further, upon execution of this agreement and a plea agreement with the State Attorney's Office, 
the federal Grand Jury investigation will be suspende4 and all pending federal Grand Jury 
subpoenas will be held in abeyance unless and until the defendant violates any teen of this 
agreement. The defendant likewise agrees to withdraw his pending motion to intervene and to 
quash certain grand jury subpoenas. 
See Tab 21, September 24, 2007 Non Prosecution A reement. It also uarantees th 
identified in the Grand Jury subpoena such as 
and 
and others will not be prosecuted. The new Grand Jury subpoena clearly violates the Non-
Prosecution Agreement. 
Although Mr. Epstein has exercised his rights to appeal to the 
Department of Justice with the full consent and knowledge of the USAO, he has not breached the 
Agreement. The re-commencing of the Grand Jury is in violation of the Agreement. 
But further, the new investigation, which features a wide-ranging, fishing-expedition type 
to search in New York does nothing to satisfy the very essential elements of federal statutes that 
are lacking despite the intensity of an over two-year investigation in the Palm Beach area. 
Absent evidence of Internet luring, inducements while using the phone, travel for the purpose, 
fraud or coercion, the subject of the New York investigation is as lacking in the essential basis 
for converting a state case into a federal case as is the remainder of the Florida investigation. 
The reaching out to New York to fill the void emanating from the failures of the Florida 
investigation compellingly demonstrates the misuse of federal resources in an overzealous, over-
personalized, selective and extraordin 
attempt to expand federal law to where it is has never 
gone. This last-ditch attempt by Ms. ar 
einforces our belief that the USAO does not have 
facts that, without distortion, would justify a prosecution of Mr. Epstein. 
In view of the prosecution's often-verbalized desire to punish Mr. Epstein, we believe 
that the prosecution summary suffers from critical inaccuracies and aggregates the expected 
testimony of witnesses so as to reach a conclusion of guilt. Our contention is reinforced by the 
fact that key prosecution witnesses have provided evidence and testimony that directly 
undermines the prosecution's misleading and inaccurate summ 
of its case. Indeed, we now 
have received statements from three of the principal accusers 
(through a state 
criminal deposition , 
(through a federal FBI-USAO sworn and transcribed 
interview), and 
(through a defense—generated sworn transcribed interview). 
Each of these witnesses categorically denies each essential element that the prosecution will have 
to prove in order to convert this quintessential state-law case into a federal matter. 
EFTA00013991
--- PAGE 4 ---
KIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP 
Esq. 
June 19, 2008 
Page 4 
It thus is especially troubling that the USAO has not provided us with the transcript of 
Ms. 
s federal interview, nor the substance of the interviews with Ms. 
or Ms. 
nor any information generated by interviews with any of the approximately 40 alleged 
witnesses that the prosecution claims it has identified. Because the information provided by 
these women goes directly to the question of Mr. Epstein's guilt or innocence, it is classic Brady 
information. We understand that the U.S. Attorney might not want to disclose impeachment 
information about their witnesses prior to a charge or during plea negotiations. But we firmly 
believe that when the Government possesses information that goes directly to a target's factual 
guilt or innocence, the target should be informed about such heartland exculpatory evidence. 
Most importantly, aside from whether the Department believes Brady obligates 
disclosure to a target of a federal investigation prior to the target's formal accusation, no such 
limit should apply to a Department review. Accordingly, we request that you go beneath the face 
of any summary provided to you by the USAO and instead review the actual witness transcripts 
and FBI 302s, which are essential for you to be able to make a truly independent assessment of 
the strength and wisdom of any federal prosecution. 
After careful consideration of the record, and as much as it pains me to say this, I simply 
do not believe federal prosecutors would have been involved at all in this matter if not for Mr. 
Epstein's personal wealth and publicly-reported ties to former President Bill Clinton. A simple 
Internet search on Mr. Epstein reveals myriad articles and news stories about the former 
President's personal relationship with Mr. Epstein, including multi-page stories in New York 
Magazine and Vanity Fair. Mr. Epstein, in fact, only came to the public's attention a few years 
ago when he and the former President traveled for a week to Africa (using Mr. Epstein's 
airplane)—a trip that received a great deal of press coverage. I cannot imagine that the USAO 
ever would have contemplated a prosecution in this case if Mr. Epstein lacked this type of 
notoriety. 
That belief has been reinforced by the significant prosecutorial impropriety and 
misconduct throughout the course of this matter. While we describe the majority of these 
irregularities in another submission, two instances are particularly troubling. First, the USAO 
authorized the public disclosure of specific details of the open investigation to the New York 
Times—including descriptions of the prosecution's t
i  sh
n  of the case and specific terms of a plea 
negotiation between the parties. Second, AUSA 
attempted to enrich friends and close 
acquaintances by bringing them business in connection with this matter. Specifically, she 
attempted to appoint a close personal friend of her live-in boyfriend to serve as an attorney-
representative for the women involved in this case. 
It also bears mentioning that actions taken by FAUSA 
present an appearance of 
impropriety that gives us cause for concern. Mr. 
's former law partner is currently 
pursuing a handful of $50-million lawsuits against Mr. Epstein by some of the masseuses.

Page 5 
Finally, as you know, Mr. Epstein and the USAO entered into an agreement that deferred 
prosecution to the State. In this regard, I sprite 
that the manner in which this agreement 
was negotiated contrasts sharply with Mr. 
s current representation that "[The SDFL 
indicated a willingness to de er to the State the length of incarceration . . . " See Tab 1, May 19, 
2008 Letter fro.. 
p. 2. This statement is simply not true. Contrary to Ma's 
assertion, federal prosecutors refused to accept what the State believed to be appropriate as to 
Mr. Epstein's sentence and instead, insisted that Mr. Epstein be required serve a two-year term of 
imprisonment (which they later decreased to 18 months plus one year of house arrest). Federal 
prosecutors have not only involved themselves in what is quintessentially a state matter, but their 
actions have caused a critical appearance of impropriety that raises doubt as to their motivation 
for investigating and prosecuting Mr. Epstein in the first place. 
At bottom, we appreciate your willingness to review this matter with a fresh—and 
independent—set of eyes. To facilitate your review, I once again request the opportunity to 
make an oral presentation to supplement our written submissions, and we will promptly respond 
to any inquiries you may have.

Dear Roy: 
In accordance with paragraph 13 of the Non-Prosecution Agreement, lam providing notice of possible compulsory process commanding 
the disclosure of the Agreement. As I'm sure you know, two of Mr. Epstein's victims have filed suit against the United States alleging that 
the government violated their rights as victims by not consulting them prior to entering into the Non-Prosecution Agreement. 
As part of their response to one of the government's filings, the victims asked the Court to order the production of the Non-Prosecution 
Agreement. The deadline for the government to respond is August 15th and we intend to oppose the motion based upon the confidentiality 
provision. I have attached a copy of the victims' pleading for your review. 
In connection with this, we want to make certain that we are making consistent representations to the judiciary regarding the contents of 
the Agreement. I know that Jack Goldberger filed the Agreement under seal in the state court in accordance with the state judge's order. 
Can you provide us with a copy of what Jack filed, so that, if we are ordered by the federal court to disclose the agreement, it is exactly the 
same as what has been filed in the state court?

Colleagues, 
(USAFLS) 
The hearing this morning lasted 45 minutes. Judge Marra first heard argument from Brad Edwards, who 
harangued the government for permitting Epstein to get off with a light sentence in state court. He argued 
that the victims were entitled to be consulted before this agreement was reached, and the court should set the 
agreement aside. Edwards again argued that the rights in section 3771(a) accrue prior to the filing of any 
charges. 
In my portion of the argument, I advised the court of the status of Epstein's state case: (1) he entered pleas of 
guilty to two state charges on June 30, 2008; (2) he was sentenced to 18 months' incarceration and 1 year of 
community control; and (3) he was serving his sentence of incarceration. The court queried me on the Dean 
case and the government's position on when the rights in section 3371(a) applied. I distinguished Dean and 
argued that rights under 3771(a) does not accrue until a charge is filing in district court. 
I noted that the 
A/G's guidelines are applied with common sense, such that a victim claiming they were being threatened by a 
perpetrator would not be turned away since an indictment had not been returned. I also argued that 18 
U.S.C. 3771 did not grant authority to the court to set aside the agreement in the instant case, since it was not a 
plea agreement filed with court, which it had the discretion to accept or reject. The court had questions 
regarding the completion of the agreement in September 2007, but the plea was not entered until June 30, 
2008. I advised the court that Epstein's attorneys sought higher review of the agreement within the DOJ. 
As to the motion to seal the government's response, the court asked if that was necessary any more, since a 
public hearing had been held and much of what was filed had been discussed. 
I argued that the government 
had two bases for sealing: (1) protection of the privacy of the minor victims; and (2) confidentiality of 
negotiations with Epstein's attorneys and the confidentiality clause in the Agreement. 
Edwards waived any 
protection for his clients, two of whom were present in court I 
.) 
As to the confidentiality, the 
court found that the discussions regarding the potential impeachment of the victims because of the availability 
of relief under 18 U.S.C. 2255 had already been discussed at the hearing. I argued that the exact clause in the 
agreement pertaining to section 2255 had been cited in the notification letters to 
filed, and the government had agreed to notify Epstein before making any disclosure.

The court ordered the government's response, 
declaration, and the attachments, unsealed. Also, 
Edwards filed a reply, which is also a public record document. 
The court noted that, since Epstein had entered his plea and was sentenced, this was no longer an emergency. 
Both parties agreed. The court wanted to know if any evidentiary hearing need to be held. Since there is a 
dispute over what the FBI agents told 
in September 2007, I asked the court to permit the parties to speak 
to determine if there are any factual disputes which require a hearing. The court agreed. 
There was a reporter from the Sun Sentinel present in the audience.

RE: 
Jeffrey Epstein 
Dear 
Thank you for your letter of July 17, 2008. In it, you ask whether Mr. Epstein "intends to fully 
abide by the Non-Prosecution Agreement." The answer is yes. 
We confirm as you state in your letter that the Agreement requires that "the federal Grand Jury 
investigation will remain suspended, and all pending federal Grand Jury subpoenas will be held 
in abeyance unless and until [Mr. Epstein] violates any term of [the Non-Prosecution 
Agreement]." We also confirm that under the Agreement, "prosecution in this District for these 
offenses shall be deferred in favor of prosecution by the State of Florida, provided that Epstein 
abides by the . 
conditions and the requirements of th[e] Agreement." 
As you know, there is no provision in the Agreement refening in any way to Section 3509(k). 
By that statute, Congress imposed a mandatory obligation on federal district courts to stay 
certain civil cases. Its operation is not subject to the control or discretion of any party. Whether 
Title 18, United States Code, Section 3509(k) applies to this civil litigation is a question of law 
for resolution by Judge Marra. Accordingly, we are abiding by our ethical obligation to advise 
the Court of its statutory mandate under Section 3509(k). 
Finally, thank you for notifying me that our motion to quash teclmically remains outstanding. 
We had previously notified the Court that the parties did not wish to argue the issue. I agree that 
the Agreement requires its withdrawal and we will file a formal notice withdrawing it this week. 
Please do not hesitate to call me if you wish further clarification of our position or to discuss this 
matter in any way. Until then, I remain, 
Very truly yours,

Subject: Epstein 
Hi M— I just got an earful from the last of the victims' lawyers. He is a former Broward County ASA and he represents three victims. 
He says that his clients can name many more victims and wanted to know if we can get out of the deal. I told him that, at this time, 
assuming that Epstein performs the last piece of the agreement, we are bound. He asked that, if there is the slightest hesitation on Epstein's 
part of completing his performance, that he and his clients be allowed to consult with our office before making a decision. 
I also couldn't remember if I told you about our meeting with the Sheriff's Office about the jail. Epstein is out at the stockade, not the jail. 
Goldberger and some psychiatrist have already met with him and have told him that, if he receives any less favorable treatment than others, 
Ken Starr and the whole crew will sue. He also told me that Epstein was "brilliant" and that he has already offered to teach GED classes. I 
sort of cocked my head at the "brilliant" comment and said, you know he only has a high school diploma, right? (I used my best, "don't 
believe the hype" voice. He was clearly shocked, and I explained that Epstein usually claims to have at least a master's degree, but other 
than a few college courses, he had no education above a high school diploma, which I think makes him ineligible to teach a GED course.) 
He also told us that Epstein is eligible for work release and will be placed on work release — in direct contradiction to what he told the 
agents a few months ago.

& U.S. MAIL 
Ms. 
Assistant United States Attorney 
Southern District of Florida 
West Palm Beach, Florida 33401 
Re: 
Ethics Inquiry 28386 
Dear Ms. 
I received your request for an advisory ethics opinion dated September 18, 2008. You ask 
whether you violated Rule 4-7.4, Rules Regulating The Florida Bar, by complying with your 
statutory obligation to contact victims to inform them of the resolution of their matters and by 
complying with a court order to advise them that the services of an independent attorney-
representative would be offered to them free of charge. 
Unfortunately, I cannot provide the opinion you requested, because you are asking about your 
past conduct and legal questions that relate to your obligations under federal statutes and a court 
order. Florida Bar ethics attorneys are only authorized to provide opinions regarding an 
attorney's own future conduct. We are not authorized to render opinions concerning an 
attorney's past conduct or legal questions. See Procedures 2 (a)(1)(B) and 2(a)(1)(D), Florida 
Bar Procedures for Ruling on Questions of Ethics (www.floridabar.org ). 
Although I cannot provide an opinion, I can discuss the relevant rules. Generally speaking, Rule 
4-7.4 (a), prohibits an attorney from soliciting clients in person or through an agent, or in writing 
without complying with the attorney advertising rules, if the lawyer's primary motive is 
pecuniary gain, and states: 
(a) Solicitation. Except as provided in subdivision (b) of this rule, a lawyer 
shall not solicit professional employment from a prospective client with whom the 
lawyer has no family or prior professional relationship, in person or otherwise, 
when a significant motive for the lawyer's doing so is the lawyer's pecuniary 
gain. A lawyer shall not permit employees or agents of the lawyer to solicit in the 
lawyer's behalf. A lawyer shall not enter into an agreement for, charge, or collect 
a fee for professional employment obtained in violation of this rule. The term 
"solicit" includes contact in person, by telephone, telegraph, or facsimile, or by 
EFTA00014011
--- PAGE 2 ---
Ms. 
November 4, 2008 
Page 2 
other communication directed to a specific recipient and includes (i) any written 
form of communication directed to a specific recipient and not meeting the 
requirements of subdivision (b) of this rule, and (ii) any electronic mail 
communication directed to a specific recipient and not meeting the requirements 
of subdivision (c) of rule 4-7.6. 
Emphasis added. If your contact with victims is neither motivated by pecuniary gain nor to 
assist another lawyer whose significant motive is pecuniary gain, then it is unlikely that your 
contact with victims could be characterized as improper solicitation in violation of Rule 4-7.4 
(a). 
Although your letter does not reference Rule 4-4.2 ("Communication with Person Represented 
by Counsel"), this rule prohibits a lawyer from communicating directly with a person the lawyer 
knows is represented in a particular matter, and states: 
(a) In representing a client, a lawyer shall not communicate about the subject 
of the representation with a person the lawyer knows to be represented by another 
lawyer in the matter, unless the lawyer has the consent of the other lawyer. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, an attorney may, without such prior consent, 
communicate with another's client in order to meet the requirements of any 
court rule, statute or contract requiring notice or service of process directly on an 
adverse party, in which event the communication shall be strictly restricted to that 
required by the court rule, statute or contract, and a copy shall be provided to the 
adverse party's attorney. 
Emphasis added. It would be prudent for you to comply with this rule by limiting your contact 
to the lawyers of represented victims. Whether or not you were required to comply with this rule 
in the past, or whether you would be required to comply with it in the future, given your 
obligations under the federal statutes and the relevant court order involves legal questions 
beyond the scope of an ethics opinion. 
Finally, Rule 4-3.4, prohibits a lawyer from deliberately violating a court's order, and states: 
A lawyer shall not: 
(c) knowingly disobey an obligation under the rules of a tribunal except for an 
open refusal based on an assertion that no valid obligation exists; 
Emphasis added. 
EFTA00014012
--- PAGE 3 ---
Ms. 
November 4, 2008 
Page 3 
Thus, Rule 4-3.4 (c), requires you to comply with any orders issued by the court. Again, I can 
provide no opinion on how to accomplish compliance, because interpretation of the court order 
requires legal advice beyond the scope of an ethics opinion.

Re: 
Request for Written Staff Opinion 
Dear Sir or Madam: 
I am an Assistant United States Attorney and a member in good standing of the 
Florida Bar. I am writing to request a written staff opinion on an issue related to contact with 
unrepresented parties. 
As part of my employment, I have investigated and presented for prosecution a case 
involving the sexual abuse of several young women who were teenagers at the time of the 
abuse. There is a federal statute, 18 U.S.C. § 2255, that provides a civil cause of action for 
victims of the federal crimes that I investigated, which sets a minimum of $150,000 in 
damages. 
At the request of counsel for the putative defendant, the U.S. Attorney's Office 
entered into pre-indictment plea negotiations that resulted in the signing of a Non-
Prosecution Agreement ("Agreement"). The Agreement called for the putative defendant to 
plead guilty to state criminal offenses that would result in the defendant's designation as a 
sex offender. The Agreement also sought to place the victims in the same position where 
they would have been if the defendant had been convicted of the federal offenses. 
Accordingly, the Agreement required the defendant to agree to waive challenges to liability 
and damages related to claims brought pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2255. In light of the large 
'In addition to the general rules regarding confidentiality, this letter relates to a confidential 
Non-Prosecution Agreement, and, accordingly, I would ask that the information contained herein 
remain confidential.

number of young, vulnerable, and unsophisticated victims, the U.S. Attorney's Office also 
included agreement terms requiring the defendant to pay for the services of an independent 
attorney-representative, whose services would be offered (without obligation) to the victims 
free of charge. The U.S. Attorney's Office asked the former Chief United States District 
Judge to serve pro bono as a Special Master for the selection of the attorney-representative. 
The Special Master selected Robert Josefsberg and his firm, Podhurst Orseck, to serve as the 
attorney-representative. 
Under federal law, I have several obligations related to victims, including an 
obligation to confer with them and advise them of resolution of their matters. See, e.g., 18 
U.S.C. § 3771. Accordingly, I have prepared a letter informing the victims of how the matter 
was resolved, including the appointment of Mr. Josefsberg. The letter advises the victims 
that Mr. Josefsberg will be in contact with them shortly and invites the victims to contact Mr. 
Josefsberg directly if they so choose. A copy of the letter, with some identifying information 
redacted, is attached. This letter was reviewed by attorneys for the defendant before it was 
sent. 
During the pendency of the investigation, some of the victims retained civil attorneys 
to represent them in civil suits against the defendant. For those victims whom I knew to be 
represented, I sent a modified version of the letter to the attorney, rather than to the victim, 
and asked the attorney to convey the substance of the letter to the victim. In that letter, the 
discussion of contact with Mr. Josefsberg made clear that Mr. Josefsberg's contact would be 
with the attorney only, not directly with the victim. A copy of the letter for those victims 
already represented by counsel also is attached. 
I understand that you do not opine on past events, and some of these letters already 
have been distributed, but several victims have yet to be notified, and I need guidance on 
how to proceed. 
Unbeknownst to me, one victim had obtained counsel prior to receiving my letter. I 
have received a letter from that attorney asserting that my contact with the victims violates 
Florida Bar Rule 4-7.4. I have reviewed the rule and do not understand how it would apply 
to me because: (1) I am not soliciting employment from a prospective client; (2) I am not 
seeking pecuniary gain; (3) none of the victims has expressed a desire not to receive 
communications from me; (4) the letter does not involve coercion, duress, fraud, 
overreaching, harassment, intimidation, or undue influence; (5) the letter is not false, 
fraudulent, misleading, or deceptive; and (6) there is nothing about the mental or physical

PAGE 3 
states of the victims that leads me to believe that they cannot review and understand the 
information that is included in the letter. 
Can you provide me with a written opinion on this issue so that I may revise the letters 
that have not yet been distributed if you deem it necessary? 
I understand that the same attorney has made contact with Mr. Josefsberg, also 
accusing him of violating the same rule. Since the benefit to these victims will be lost if Mr. 
Josefsberg cannot advise them in detail of their rights under the Agreement, I understand that 
his firm will be contacting your Office for similar guidance. 
Please let me know if you need any additional information, and thank you for your 
kind assistance with this matter.

Re: 
IDefendantl/lVietiml: NOTIFICATION OF IDENTIFIED 
VICTIM 
Dear Ms. [Victim]: 
By virtue of this letter, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District 
of Florida provides you with the following notice because you are an identified victim of a 
federal offense. 
On June 30, 2008, [Defendant] entered a plea of guilty to violations of Florida Statutes 
Sections [insert case information] and was sentenced to a term of twelve months' 
imprisonment to be followed by an additional six months' imprisonment, followed by twelve 
months of Community Control 1, with conditions of community confinement imposed by the 
Court. 
In light of the entry of the guilty plea and sentence, the United States has agreed to 
defer federal prosecution in favor of this state plea and sentence, subject to certain 
conditions, including the following: 
1. 
An independent Special Master was assigned the task of selecting an 
attorney representative to represent the victims, including you, in 
connection with civil actions between the victims and [Defendant.] The 
Special Master selected Robert Josefsberg, Esq. of the firm Podhurst 
Orseck, P.A., a highly-respected and experienced attorney. You are not 
obligated to use Mr. Josefsberg as your civil attorney, but, as explained 
in greater detail below, Mr. Josefsberg's services will be provided at no 
cost to you because [Defendant] is obligated to pay the costs and fees 
of the attorney-representative. Also, [Defendant] and his attorneys can 
only contact you via Mr. Josefsberg, assuming that you would like Mr. 
Josefsberg to serve as your attorney.

2. 
If you elect to file suit against [Defendant] pursuant to Title 18, United 
States Code, Section 2255, [Defendant] will not contest the jurisdiction 
of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida 
over his person and/or the subject matter, and [Defendant] waives his 
right to contest liability and also waives his right to contest damages up 
to an amount as agreed to between you and [Defendant], so long as you 
elect to proceed exclusively under 18 U.S.C. § 2255, and you waive 
any other claim for damages, whether pursuant to state, federal, or 
common law. Notwithstanding this waiver, [Defendant's] agreement 
with the United States, his waivers and failure to contest liability and 
such damages in any suit are not to be construed as an admission of any 
criminal or civil liability. 
3. 
As stated above, [Defendant] has agreed to pay the fees of the attorney 
representative selected by the independent third party. This provision, 
however, shall not obligate [Defendant] to pay the fees and costs of 
contested litigation filed against him. Thus, if after consideration of 
potential settlements, you and Mr. Josefsberg elect to file a contested 
lawsuit pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2255 or you elect to pursue any other 
contested remedy, the obligation to pay the costs of the attorney 
representative, as opposed to any statutory or other obligations to pay 
reasonable attorneys fees and costs such as those contained in Section 
2255, shall cease. 
Mr. Josefsberg will be contacting you within the next two weeks to explain these 
terms. If you would like to contact Mr. Josefsberg directly, he can be reached at 
If you have already selected other counsel to represent you, or if you do so in the 
future, and you decide to file a claim against [Defendant], [Defendant's] attorney, [attorney 
name], asks that you have your attorney contact him at [firm name and address]. 
In addition, there has been litigation between the United States and two other victims 
regarding the disclosure of the entire agreement between the United States and [defendant]. 
Mr. Josefsberg can provide further guidance on this issue, or if you select another attorney 
to represent you, that attorney can review the Court's order in the matter of In re Jane Does

Not exactly. Mr. Epstein is only supposed to go directly from jail to work and back. If he deviates from that 
route, right now no alarms will go off unless, during that deviation, he enters an exclusionary zone. If, for 
example, his driver breaks the rules and takes him for a tour of Royal Palm Beach while en route to Mr. 
Goldberger's office, and that tour takes him near one of the programmed addresses, the alarm will go off. I don't 
know what the radius is for the exclusionary zone, but, if the alarm were to go off, Mr. Epstein would know that 
he is near one of the prohibited places, but wouldn't know whose address it was and whether the address was 
their home, place of work, or place of study. 
If you need more detail, I will need to reach out to Captain Sleeth, and I am happy to do so.

One of them makes clear that our office was not informed of the release until well after the fact. 
I told the Chief that we had written a letter to the Sheriff's Office and he said he would use a public records

Subject: Re: Jeffrey Epstein 
Po
since receipt of your letter I have looked into the situation and 
e 
lowing is what is happening: 
Mr. Epstein has not breached the Non-Prosecution Agreement 
(the "Agreement") by serving a portion of his 18-month 
sentence of imprisonment in the Palm Beach County Work 
Release Program. 
1. He is currently serving his sentence in the Palm 
Beach County Work Release Program, not in the 
State-Regulated Community Control Program. Thus he is not on community 
control. 
o The County Jail sentence he is presently serving is 
being served under the auspices of the Palm Beach 
County Sheriff's Office. 
o The Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office has a policy 
of allowing work release under certain criteria for 
those sentenced to the Palm Beach County Detention 
Center or Stockade. It has already been determined 
that Mr. Epstein qualifies under the Palm Beach County Sheriff's 
Office policy for work release. The Florida statute 
authorizing work release for someone imprisoned in 
county jail is at 951.24 (2Xa). 
o The statute provides that when punishment by 
imprisonment in the county jail is prescribed, the 
sentencing court, in its discretion, may at any time 
during the sentence consider granting the privilege to 
the prisoner to leave the confines of the jail or 
county facility during necessary and reasonable hours, 
EFTA00014038
--- PAGE 2 ---
subject to the rules and regulations prescribed by the 
court, to work at paid employment or to conduct his or 
her own business or profession. See Fla. Stat. § 
951.24(2)(a). 
o In Palm Beach County, the Sheriff's Office has 
discretion over work release. The local rules state 
that placement into House Arrest and Work Release "is 
at the discretion of the Sheriff and the presiding 
Judge" and offer no defined scope of the type of 
offenders that are eligible—or that are barred—from 
serving their time in Work Release." See Palm Beach 
County Department of Corrections Inmate Rule G-16. 
2. The Non Prosecution Agreement does not prohibit 
work release. 
o The Agreement does not regulate what programs Mr. Epstein can 
participate in while he is serving the County Jail 
sentence. 
3. The Agreement expressly provides that he is to be 
afforded the same benefits that any other inmate might 
receive. See ¶ 12 of the Agreement. 
5. Under Florida Law, work release is considered part 
of the confinement. See Rule 33.60L602, Fla. Admin. 
Code. (work release "allows inmates to work at paid 
employment in the community while continuing as inmates 
of the facility where they are confined.").So he is an inmate. 
6. 
recognized that Mr. Epstein 
might serve a portion of his sentence through the Work 
Release Program. 
o. On December 6, 2007, after the Agreement had been 
executed, counsel received a draft notification 
letter in which US Attorney 
expresses this 
intention. The draft document provides that the 
recipient is "entitled to notification when Mr. Epstein 
is released from imprisonment at the end of his prison 
term and/or if he is allowed to participate in a work 
release program." See December 6, 2007 letter to J. 
Lefkowitz from- 
attaching draft notification 
letter, p. 8. 
7. I am told that on July 3, 2008, you wrote an email 
to the Deputy Sherriff stating that the US Attorney's 
Office had no objection to work release as long as 
Epstein is treated as any similarly situated inmate. If anything 
he is being treated more harshly than any other inmate in 
the program. He can't leave the office. He has a guard 
and is wearing a GPS device. So his teens are not more lenientbut rather 
more restrictive than any other 
inmate in the program. 
Clearly we do not feel this is a violation of the agreement and we have 
no intent to violate it. We will meet with you and anyone in the 
executive office to resolve this matter. Certainly it would be best for 
us to meet and discuss.

Page 2 of 7 
EFTA00014047
--- PAGE 3 ---
Terms of the Agreement: 
1. 
Epstein shall plead guilty (not nolo contendere) to the Indictment as 
currently pending against him in the 15th Judicial Circuit in and for 
Palm Beach County (Case No. 2006-cf-009495AXXXMB) charging

796.07. In addition, Epstein shall plead guilty to an Information filed

2. 
Epstein shall make a binding recommendation that the Court impose a 
thirty (30) month sentence to be divided as follows: 
(a) 
Epstein shall be sentenced to consecutive terms of twelve (12) 
months and six (6) months in county jail for all charges, without 
any opportunity for withholding adjudication or sentencing, and 
without probation or community control in lieu of 
imprisonment; and 
(b) 
Epstein shall be sentenced to a term of twelve (12) months of 
community control consecutive to his two terms in county jail 
as described in Term 2(a), supra. 
3. 
This agreement is contingent upon a Judge of the 15th Judicial Circuit 
accepting and executing the sentence agreed upon between the State 
Attorney's Office and Epstein, the details of which are set forth in this 
agreement. 
4. 
The terms contained in paragraphs 1 and 2, supra, do not foreclose 
Epstein and the State Attorney's Office from agreeing to recommend 
any additional charge(s) or any additional term(s) of probation and/or 
incarceration. 
5. 
Epstein shall waive all challenges to the Information filed by the State 
Attorney's Office and shall waive the right to appeal his conviction and 
sentence, except a sentence that exceeds what is set forth in paragraph 
(2), supra. 
6. 
Epstein shall provide to the U.S. Attorney's Office copies of all 
Page 3 of 7 
EFTA00014048
--- PAGE 4 ---
proposed agreements with the State Attorney's Office prior to entering 
into those agreements. 
7. 
The United States shall provide Epstein's attorneys with a list of 
individuals whom it has identified as victims, as defined in 18 U.S.C. 
§ 2255, after Epstein has signed this agreement and been sentenced. 
Upon the execution of this agreement, the United States, in consultation 
with and subject to the good faith approval of Epstein's counsel, shall 
select an attorney representative for these persons, who shall be paid for 
by Epstein. Epstcin's counsel may contact the identified individuals 
through that representative. 
8. 
If any of the individuals referred to in paragraph (7), supra, elects to 
file suit pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2255, Epstein will not contest the 
jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District 
of Florida over his person and/or the subject matter, and Epstein waives 
his right to contest liability and also waives his right to contest damages 
up to an amount as agreed to between the identified individual and 
Epstein, so long as the identified individual elects to proceed 
exclusively under 18 U.S.C. § 2255, and agrees to waive any other 
claim for damages, whether pursuant to state, federal, or common law. 
Notwithstanding this waiver, as to those individuals whose names 
appear on the list provided by the United States, Epstein's signature on 
this agreement, his waivers and failures to contest liability and such 
damages in any suit are not to be construed as an admission of any 
criminal or civil liability. 
9. 
Epstein's signature on this agreement also is not to be construed as an 
admission of civil or criminal liability or a waiver of any jurisdictional 
or other defense as to any person whose name does not appear on the 
list provided by the United States. 
10. 
Except as to those individuals who elect to proceed exclusively under 
U.S.C. § 2255, as set forth in paragraph (8), supra, neither Epstein's 
signature on this agreement, nor its terms, nor any resulting waivers or 
settlements by Epstein are to be construed as admissions or evidence of 
civil or criminal liability or a waiver of any jurisdictional or other 
defense as to any person, whether or not her name appears on the list 
provided by the United States. 
11. 
Epstein shall use his best efforts to enter his guilty plea and be 
Page 4 of 7 
EFTA00014049
--- PAGE 5 ---
sentenced not later than October 26, 2007. The United States has no 
objection to Epstein self-reporting to begin serving his sentence not 
later than January 4, 2008. 
12. 
Epstein agrees that he will not be afforded any benefits with respect to 
gain time, other than the rights, opportunities, and benefits as any other 
inmate, including but not limited to, eligibility for gain time credit 
based on standard rules and regulations that apply in the State of 
Florida. At the United States' request, Epstein agrees to provide an 
accounting of the gain time he earned during his period of 
incarceration. 
13. 
The parties anticipate that this agreement will not be made part of any 
public record. If the United States receives a Freedom of Information 
Act request or any compulsory process commanding the disclosure of 
the agreement, it will provide notice to Epstein before making that 
disclosure. 
Epstein understands that the United States Attorney has no authority to require the 
State Attorney's Office to abide by any terms of this agreement. Epstein understands that 
it is his obligation to undertake discussions with the State Attorney's Office and to use his 
best efforts to ensure compliance with these procedures, which compliance will be necessary 
to satisfy the United States' interest. Epstein also understands that it is his obligation to use 
his best efforts to convince the Judge of the 15th Judicial Circuit to accept Epstein's binding 
recommendation regarding the sentence to be imposed, and understands that the failure to 
do so will be a breach of the agreement. 
In consideration of Epstein's agreement to plead guilty and to provide compensation 
in the manner described above, if Epstein successfully fulfills all of the terms and conditions 
of this agreement, the United States also agrees that it will not institute any criminal char cs 
• 
" 
ing but not limited to 
Further, upon execution of this 
agreement and a plea agreement with the State Attorney's Office, the federal Grand Jury 
investigation will be suspended, and all pending federal Grand Jury subpoenas will be held 
in abeyance unless and until the defendant violates any term of this agreement. The 
defendant likewise agrees to withdraw his pending motion to intervene and to quash certain 
grand jury subpoenas. Both parties agree to maintain their evidence, specifically evidence 
requested by or directly related to the grand jury subpoenas that have been issued, and 
including certain computer equipment, inviolate until all of the terms of this agreement have 
been satisfied. Upon the successful completion of the terms of this agreement, all 
outstanding grand jury subpoenas shall be deemed withdrawn. 
Page 5 of 7 
EFTA00014050
--- PAGE 6 ---
By signing this agreement, Epstein asserts and certifies that each of these terms is 
material to this agreement and is supported by independent consideration and that a breach 
of any one of these conditions allows the United States to elect to terminate the agreement 
and to investigate and prosecute Epstein and any other individual or entity for any and all 
federal offenses. 
By signing this agreement, Epstein asserts and certifies that he is aware of the fact that 
the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States provides that in all criminal 
prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial. Epstein further 
is aware that Rule 48(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that the Court 
may dismiss an indictment, information, or complaint for unnecessary delay in presenting 
a charge to the Grand Jury, filing an information, or in bringing a defendant to trial. Epstein 
hereby requests that the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida defer such 
prosecution. Epstein agrees and consents that any delay from the date of this Agreement to 
the date of initiation of prosecution, as provided for in the terms expressed herein, shall be 
deemed to be a necessary delay at his own request, and he hereby waives any defense to such 
prosecution on the ground that such delay operated to deny him rights under Rule 48(b) of 
the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the 
United States to a speedy trial or to bar the prosecution by reason of the running of the statute 
of limitations for a period of months equal to the period between the signing of this 
agreement and the breach of this agreement as to those offenses that were the subject of the 
grand jury's investigation. Epstein further asserts and certifies that he understands that the 
Fifth Amendment and Rule 7(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provide that all 
felonies must be charged in an indictment presented to a grand jury. Epstein hereby agrees 
and consents that, if a prosecution against him is instituted for any offense that was the 
subject of the grand jury's investigation, it may be by way of an Information signed and filed 
by the United States Attorney, and hereby waives his right to be indicted by a grand jury as 
to any such offense.

IN RE: 
INVESTIGATION OF 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN 
ADDENDUM TO THE NON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENT 
IT APPEARING that the panics seek to clarify certain provisions of page 4, paragraph 7 
of the Non-Prosecution Agreement (hereinafter "paragraph 7"), that agreement is modified as 
fol lows: 
7A. 
The United States has the right to assign to an independent third-party the responsibility 
for consulting with and, subject to the good faith approval of Epstein's counsel, selecting 
the attorney representative for the individuals identified under the Agreement. If the 
United States elects to assign this responsibility to an independent third-party, both the 
United States and Epstein retain the right to make good faith objections to the attorney 
representative suggested by the independent third-party prior to the final designation of 
the attorney representative. 
7B. 
The parties will jointly prepare a short written submission to the independent third•party 
regarding the role of the attorney representative and regarding Epstein's Agreement to 
pay such attorney representative his or her regular customary hourly rate for representing 
such victims subject to the provisions of paragraph C, infra. 
7C. 
Pursuant to additional paragraph 7A, Epstein has agreed to pay the fees of the attorney 
representative selected by the independent third party. This provision, however, shall not 
obligate Epstein to pay the foes and costs of contested litigation filed against him. Thus, 
if after consideration of potential settlements, an attorney representative elects to file a 
contested lawsuit pursuant to 18 U.S.C. s 2255 or elects to pursue any other contested 
remedy, the paragraph 7 obligation of the Agreement to pay the costs of the attorney 
representative, as opposed to any statutory or other obligations to pay reasonable 
attorneys fees and costs such as those contained in s 2255 to bear the costs of the attorney 
representative, shall cease.

Dear Roy and Jay: 
I am attaching the United States' Response to the Petitioners' Motion to Unseal the Non-Prosecution Agreement, 
which was filed in the victims' rights suit filed against the United States by Attorney Brad Edwards on behalf of 
two of the victims. In his motion to unseal, Attorney Edwards stated that he would provide notice of his motion 
to counsel for Mr. Epstein. I do not know if he actually did so. 
In our response, we oppose the Petitioners' motion, and point out that Mr. Edwards has filed a civil suit against 
Mr. Epstein and that litigation regarding the Non-Prosecution Agreement is more appropriate in that forum 
where the real party in interest (Mr. Epstein) is a party to the suit.

IN RE: 
SEARCH WARRANT APPLICATION 
MOTION TO FILE DOCUMENTS UNDER SEAL 
The United States of America, by and through the undersigned Assistant United States Attorney, hereby 
moves to seal its Application for Search Warrant for the following reasons: 
I. The attached documents contain information relating to an ongoing grand jury investigation; thus, 
pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)(6), all records and orders related to the grand-jury proceedings must be kept 
under seal to the extent and as long as necessary to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of a matter occurring 
before the grand jury. 
2. Public disclosure of this matter would jeopardize the criminal investigation, notify potential subjects 
and/or targets and undermine the public interest and the function of the grand jury. 
WHEREFORE, the United States respectfully requests that the aforementioned documents be sealed. 
Respectfully submitted,

Ms. Belohlavek, 
We represent The Palm Beach Daily News. The newspaper recently discovered that a non-prosecution agreement (and 
an addendum thereto) was filed under seal pursuant to an agreed order entered in the above-referenced case. Because 
the records are sealed, we cannot assess the propriety of the decision to seal them or even whether the newspaper is 
interested in the information contained therein. I was hoping you would discuss with me the nature of the agreement and 
the basis for sealing it so that we can advise our client on whether it should pursue an order unsealing the agreement. 
Please call me at your earliest convenience. 
Very truly yours,

This is my proposed Order. I think it comports with the Judge's order from yesterday and I think it is slightly more thorough. It 
is very similar to your Motion. If you are more satisfied with your wording or layout for the motion, then please incorporate the 
additional points made in my proposed order. 
My only real problem with your proposed Order is paragraph C. This just further delays us from getting the agreement, and I 
do not believe the Judge placed this burden on us. I think, as I wrote in my proposed order, that it is my duty to instruct my 
clients on the protective order and its function and to otherwise ensure that it is not violated by my clients. Getting my clients 
to "acknowledge receipt of the order and agree to its terms" could take awhile and cause unnecessary delay. I plan to talk to 
my clients about "the agreement" and at the same time instruct them as to the rules outlined in the protective order. That is all 
the Judge indicated as needed to be done.

It looks ok. Go ahead and submit it. While we would disagree with your statement that our proposed order goes well beyond 
what is at issue, since it actually covers very thoroughly the ruling by Judge Marra yesterday, at this point we feel that time is 
of the essence and we will agree with you submitting your proposed order as is. I think we all heard Judge Marra and are thus 
all clear as to the terms of the protective order and what is required. 
I would prefer that there is some language that the protective order is entered without prejudice to petitioners (seems like it 
would go in paragraph b), but if you are unable to incorporate it in your order, then I am sure there is a record from yesterday 
that could be used to help us get relief from the protective order at a later hearing. Anyway, thanks for preparing the order. 
We will look out for the "agreement". Thanks

referring to other victims, which also provides for petitioners' counsel to promptly provide a copy of the acknowledgment 
to the U.S. Attorney's Office. 
The government has no doubts that counsel for petitioners will ensure the authorized 
recipients are aware of the protective order and agree to abide by it, prior to disclosure. We do not require the 
acknowledgment in writing prior to the non-prosecution agreement being disclosed to an authorized recipient. 
We believe the petitioners' proposed protective order goes well beyond what is at issue, the government's disclosure of 
the non-prosecution agreement, conditioned on limited dissemination of the document upon receipt by petitioners. 
Consequently, we believe the attached proposed order, incorporating your revisions, is appropriate for the task at 
hand. Thanks.

Hello

First, I don't know if we've been formally introduced. Nice to meet you ... electronically at least.

Second, on the language -- As Brad mentioned, we need to see this document quite quickly in view of 
the Government's representations yesterday that Epstein is trying to ignore the agreement. As a result --
and in view of the difficulty of making immediate contact with our clients -- I propose one change. 
Instead of this: 
Prior to producing the documents to Petitioners' counsel, a copy of this Order must be provided to 
counsel and their clients, who must review and acknowledge their receipt of and agreement to abide by 
the terms of this Order, and who must provide a copy of that acknowledgment to the USAO. 
How about this: 
Before counsel for Petitioner's show the agreement to their clients or discuss the specific terms with 
them, they must provide a copy of this Order to Petitioners, who must review and acknowledge their 
receipt of and agreement to abide by the terms of this Order. Counsel for Petitioner's must promptly 
provide a copy of that acknowledgment to the USAO. 
I assume that the USAO is not concerned about us as attorneys somehow ignoring the Court's protective 
order, so this change would focus in on the non-law trained clients.

I have conferred with the lawyers on the team. They all thank you for agreeing to oppose any disclosure of the 9124107 agreement. 
We firmly believe this document is not discoverable in the civil cases. However if the court rules against you on this we request that you 
further ask that any disclosure be subject to a strong protective order prohibiting dissemination to anyone except counsel to the petitioners. 
We are particularly concerned because civil lawyers are more apt to publicize something like this than those of us who litigate on the 
criminal side of the docket. You may recall one lawyer standing on the bridge to palm beach railing over his misconceptions of the case. 
This is the typical vehicle they use to get more plaintiffs. You had also asked what documents were disclosed in the state court. As part of 
counsels obligation to fully disclose any promises or inducements which led to the plea agreement, the 9124107 agreement was filed with 
the court. It was filed under seal. Once again I want to re-assure you that Mr. Epstein and his counsel intend to stand by their agreements. If 
you or anyone in the USAO have any concern about a possible breach please call or email me again so we can discuss any dispute or 
misunderstanding and allay any concerns. Thanks again. Roy

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA 
CASE NO. 08-80736-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON 
IN RE: JANE DOE, 
Petitioner. 
GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE TO VICTIM'S EMERGENCY PETITION 
FOR ENFORCEMENT OF CRIME VICTIM RIGHTS ACT,  18 U.S.C.  § 3771 
The United States of America, by and through its undersigned counsel, files its Response to Victim's 
Emergency Petition for Enforcement of Victim Rights Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3771, and states: 
I. THERE IS NO "COURT PROCEEDING" UNDER 18 U.S.C.  § 3771(b) 
Petitioner complains that she has been denied her rights under the Crime Victims Rights Act, 18 U.S.C. § 
3771. In the emergency petition filed by the victim, she alleges the Government has denied her rights since she 
has received no consultation with the attorney for the government regarding possible disposition of the charges 
(18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(5)); no notice of any public court proceedings (18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(2)); no information 
regarding her right to restitution (18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(6)); and no notice of rights under the Crime Victim Rights 
Act (CVRA). Emergency Petition, ¶ 5. 
The instant case is unique in several respects. First, in 2006, Jeffrey Epstein was charged with felony 
solicitation of prostitution in the Circuit Court of the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, Palm Beach County, Florida. 
This charge was based upon the offenses alleged in paragraph 1 of the petition. Second, while Epstein has 
been under federal investigation, he has not been charged in the Southern District of Florida. 
Title 18, U.S.C., section 3771(b)(1) provides in pertinent part that, "[ijn any court proceeding involving 
an offense against a crime victim, the court shall ensure that the crime victim is afforded the rights described in 
subsection (a)." 
There is no "court proceeding" in the instant case since Epstein has not been charged with 
violation of any federal statute. No federal grand jury indictment has been returned, no has any criminal 
information been filed. 
In her memorandum, petitioner relies upon In Re Dean , 527 F.3d 391 (5 a  Cir. 2008), where the Fifth 
Circuit held that the CVRA required the government to "confer in some reasonable way with the victims before 
ultimately exercising its broad discretion." Id. at 395. In Dean , the government sought and obtained an ex 
parte order permitting it to negotiate a plea agreement with BP Products North America, without first consulting 
with the victims, individuals injured and survivors of those killed in a refinery explosion. 
A plea agreement 
was ultimately negotiated and the victims objected. The appellate court found that the CVRA granted a right to 
confer. However, the court declined to grant mandamus relief for prudential reasons, finding that the district 
EFTA00014077
--- PAGE 2 ---
court had the benefit of the views of the victims who chose to participate at the hearing held on whether the plea 
agreement should be accepted. Id. at 396. 
Dean is distinguishable because the government ultimately filed federal criminal charges in that case. In 
contrast, no charges have been filed in district court. The only "court proceeding" that has occurred is the one in 
state court. 
Petitioner argues that "the plain language of the CVRA extends victims' rights to situations `in which no 
prosecution is underway.'" Petition at 5, citing 18 U.S.C. § 3771(d)(3). Section 3771(d)(3) provides, in 
pertinent part, that: 
The rights described in subsection (a) shall be asserted in the district court in 
which a defendant is being prosecuted for the crime or, if no prosecution is 
underway, in the district court in the district in which the crime occurred ... 
This provision does not set forth when rights under CVRA accrue, but only designates the venue in which 
enforcement of any rights may occur. Congress has provided a venue for the assertion of purported rights under 
the CVRA, but because it provided for a venue for instances where no prosecution is underway, does not mean it 
intended to grant such rights. 
Certain rights granted under 18 U.S.C. 3771(a) likely do apply prior to the 
initiation of a federal criminal proceeding, such as the right to be reasonably protected from the accused (§ 
3771(a)(1)), and the right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay (§ 3771(a)(7)). It is also clear that other 
rights in § 377I(a) only apply after criminal proceedings have been initiated, since they refer to a "public court 
proceeding" or "public proceeding." § 3771(a)(2), (3), and (4). 
Whether § 3771(a)(5), the reasonable right to 
confer with the attorney for the Government in the case, applies in cases where a federal criminal proceeding is 
neither commenced nor even contemplated, can only be answered by looking to the text in § 3771(a), not the 
enforcement provision in § 3771(d)(3). Nothing in § 3771(a)(5) supports the petitioner's claim that she had a 
right to be consulted before the Government could enter into a non-prosecution agreement which defers federal 
prosecution in exchange for state court resolution of criminal liability, and a significant concession on an element 
of a claim for compensation under 18 U.S.C. § 2255. 
II. THE GOVERNMENT HAS USED ITS BEST EFFORTS TO COMPLY WITH 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a) 
The Epstein case was investigated initially by the Palm Beach Police Department in 2006. Exhibit A, 
Declaration of Assistant United States Attorney 
¶ 2. 
Subsequently, the Palm Beach Police 
Department sought the assistance of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Id. Throughout the 
investigation, when a victim was identified, victim notification letters were provided to the victim by both the 
FBI Victim-Witness Specialist and AUSA 
Id. , 1 3. Petitioner's counsel, Brad Edwards, Esq., 
currently represents 
and M. The victim notification letter to 
was hand-delivered by FBI agents. 
EFTA00014078
--- PAGE 3 ---
The letter to:M was hand-delivered by AUSA 
to her when she was interviewed in 
2007. 
Throughout the investigation, AUSA 
and the FBI's Victim-Witness Specialist had contact with 
Decl., ¶ 4. 
Earlier in the investigation, a 
was represented by James Eisenberg, Esq. 
Consequently, all contact with 
was made through Mr. Eisenberg. 
In mid-2007, Epstein's attorneys approached the U.S. Attorney's Office in an effort to resolve the federal 
investigation. At that time, Mr. Epstein had been charged by the State of Florida with solicitation of 
prostitution, in violation of Florida Statutes § 796.07. Mr. Epstein's attorneys sought a global resolution of this 
matter. The United States subsequently agreed to defer federal prosecution in favor of prosecution by the State 
of Florida, so long as certain basic preconditions were met. One of the key objectives for the Government was to 
preserve a federal remedy for the young girls which Epstein had sexually exploited. Thus, one condition of that 
agreement, notice of which was provided to the victims on July 9, 2008, is the following: 
"Any person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an offense 
enumerated in Title 18, United States Code, Section 2255, will have the 
same rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she would have had, if Mr. 
Epstein had been tried federally and convicted of an enumerated offense. 
For purposes of implementing this paragraph, the United States shall 
provide Mr. Epstein's attorneys with a list of individuals whom it was 
prepared to name in an Indictment as victims of an enumerated offense by 
Mr. Epstein. Any judicial authority interpreting this provision, including any 
authority determining which evidentiary burdens if any a plaintiff must 
meet, shall consider that it is the intent of the parties to place these identified 
victims in the same position as they would have been had Mr. Epstein been 
convicted at trial. No more; no less." 
The Attorney General Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance (May 2005), Article IV, Services to 
Victims and Witnesses, provides the following guidance for proposed plea agreements: 
(3) Proposed Plea Agreements. Responsible officials should make reasonable efforts to notify 
identified victims of, and consider victims' views about, prospective plea negotiations. In 
determining what is reasonable, the responsible official should consider factors relevant to the 
wisdom and practicality of giving notice and considering views in the context of the particular 
case, including, but not limited to, the following factors: 
(a) The impact on public safety and risks to personal safety. 
(b) The number of victims. 
(c) Whether time is of the essence in negotiating or entering a proposed plea. 
(d) Whether the proposed plea involves confidential information or conditions. 
(e) Whether there is another need for confidentiality. 
(0 Whether the victim is a possible witness in the case and the effect that relaying any information may 
have on the defendant's right to a fair trial. 
EFTA00014079
--- PAGE 4 ---
Throughout negotiations, Epstein's attorneys claimed that one reason victims came forward and pressed 
their claims was their desire for money. They argued that victims might have an inducement to fabricate or 
enhance their testimony, in order to maximize their opportunities to obtain financial recompense. The 
Government was extremely concerned that disclosure of the proposed terms would compromise the investigation 
by providing Epstein the means of impeaching the victim witnesses, should the parties fail to reach an 
agreement. In light of the fact (i) that the United States agreed to defer prosecution to a previously filed state 
criminal case; (ii) that as a result sentencing would take in state court before a state judge; (iii) that if the state 
resolution failed to meet minimum standards such that a federal prosecution was warranted, the victims would be 
witnesses and thus potential impeachment issues were of concern; and, (iv) the United States was already 
making efforts to secure for victims the right to proceed federally under 18 U.S.C. § 2255, even if prosecution 
took place in state court, the Government determined that its actions in proceeding with this agreement best 
balanced the dual position of the Jane Does as both victims and potential witnesses in a criminal proceeding. 
On Friday, June 27, 2008, at approximately 4:15 p.m., AUSA 
received a copy of the proposed 
state plea agreement, and learned the plea hearing was scheduled for Monday, June 30, 2008, at 8:30 a.m. 
Decl., ¶ 8. 
AUSA 
the FBI agents, and the Palm Beach Police Department, all attempted 
to provide notification to the victims. Id. AUSA 
called attorney Edwards to provide notice to his 
clients regarding the hearing. AUSA 
did this, even though she had no obligation to provide notice of 
a state court hearing. Mr. Edwards advised that he could not attend but that someone would be present at the 
hearing. Id. 
The Government has complied with 18 U.S.C. § 3771(c)(1) by using its best efforts to "see that crime 
victims are notified of, and accorded, the rights described in subsection (a)." Specifically, petitioner was 
afforded the reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the Government under 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(5). 
Disclosure of the specific terms of the negotiation were not disclosed prior to a final agreement being reached 
because the Government believed doing so would jeopardize and prejudice the prosecution in the event an 
agreement could not be made. 
Insofar as notice of any public court proceedings under 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(2), 
petitioner's counsel was notified on June 27, 2008, of the plea hearing in state court on June 30, 2008. 
Section 3771(d)(6) provides, in relevant part, that "[n]othing in this chapter shall be construed to impair 
the prosecutorial discretion of the Attorney General or any officer under his direction." The Government 
exercised its judgment and discretion in determining that there was a need for confidentiality in the negotiations 
with Epstein. 
The significant benefit of obtaining Epstein's concession that victims suing him under 18 U.S.C. 
EFTA00014080
--- PAGE 5 ---
§ 2255(a) were "victims" of the enumerated offenses, despite the fact he has not been convicted in federal court, 
was of sufficient importance to justify confidentiality of the negotiations. 
Petitioner's rights under the CVRA have not been violated. Therefore, her emergency petition should be 
denied.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA 
Case No. 08-80736-Civ-Marra/Johnson 
JANE DOE 
v. 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
DECLARATION OF A. 
1. 
I, 
do hereby declare that I am a member in good standing of the Bar 
of the State of Florida. I graduated from the University of California at Berkeley School of Law 
(Boalt Hall) in 1993. After serving as a judicial clerk to the 
in Sacramento, 
California, I was admitted to practice in California in 1995. I also am admitted to practice in all 
courts of the states of Minnesota and Florida, the Eighth, Eleventh, and Federal Circuit Courts of 
Appeals, and the U.S. District Courts for the Southern District of Florida, the District of Minnesota, 
and the Northern District of California. My bar admission status in California and Minnesota is 
currently inactive. I am currently employed as an Assistant United States Attorney in the Southern 
District of Florida and was so employed during all of the events described herein. 
2. 
I am the Assistant United States Attorney assigned to the investigation of Jeffrey 
Epstein. The case was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI"). The federal 
investigation was initiated in 2006 at the request of the Palm Beach Police Department ("PBPD") 
into allegations that Jeffrey Epstein and his personal assistants had used facilities of interstate 
commerce to induce young girls between the ages of thirteen and seventeen to engage in prostitution, 
amongst other offenses. PBPD had asked for federal assistance because of concerns regarding the 
manner in which the Palm Beach County State Attorney's Office ("State Attorney's Office") had 
handled the case. 
3. 
Throughout the investigation, when a victim was identified, victim notification letters 
were provided to her both from your Affiant and from the FBI's Victim-Witness Specialist. Attached 
hereto are copies of the letters provided to Bradley Edwards' three clients, 
Fl 
Your Affiant's letter to 
was hand-delivered by the FBI agents (Ex. 1). Your Affiant's letter to 
was hand-delivered by myself to 
at the time that she was interviewed (Ex. 2). Both 
andM also received letters from the FBI's Victim-Witness Specialist, which were dispatched on 
January 8, 2008 (Exs. 3 & 4). 
was initially identified in the PBPD's investigation. Her status as 
EFTA00014082
--- PAGE 2 ---
a victim of a federal offense was confirmed when she was interviewed by federal agents on May 28, 
2008. The FBI's Victim-Witness Specialist sent a letter to■ on May 30, 2008 (Ex. 5). 
4. 
Throughout the investigation, the FBI agents, the FBI's Victim-Witness Specialist, and 
your Affiant had contact with 
Attorney Edwards' other client, 
was represented 
by counsel and, accordingly, all contact with 
was made through that attorney. That attorney was 
James Eisenberg, and his fees were paid by Jeffrey Epstein, the target of the investigation. 
5. 
In the summer of 2007, Mr. Epstein and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern 
District of Florida ("the Office") entered into negotiations to resolve the investigation. 
At that time, 
Mr. Epstein had been charged by the State of Florida with solicitation of prostitution, in violation of Florida 
Statutes § 796.07. Mr. Epstein's attorneys sought a global resolution of the matter. The United States 
subsequently agreed to defer federal prosecution in favor of prosecution by the State of Florida, so long as 
certain basic preconditions were met. One of the key objectives for the Government was to preserve a federal 
remedy for the young girls which Epstein had sexually exploited. 
Thus, one condition of that agreement, 
notice of which was provided to the victims on July 9, 2008, is the following: 
"Any person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an offense enumerated in 
Title 18, United States Code, Section 2255, will have the same rights to proceed under 
Section 2255 as she would have had, if Mr. Epstein had been tried federally and convicted 
of an enumerated offense. For purposes of implementing this paragraph, the United States 
shall provide Mr. Epstein's attorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to 
name in an Indictment as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein. Any judicial 
authority interpreting this provision, including any authority determining which 
evidentiary burdens if any a plaintiff must meet, shall consider that it is the intent of the 
parties to place these identified victims in the same position as they would have been had 
Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less." 
An agreement was reached in September 2007. 
The Agreement contained an express confidentiality 
provision. 
6. Although individual victims were not consulted regarding the agreement, several had 
expressed concerns regarding the exposure of their identities at trial and they desired a prompt 
resolution of the matter. At the time the agreement was signed in September 2007, • 
was openly 
hostile to the prosecution of Epstein, and■ had refused to speak with federal investigators. None of 
Attorney Edwards' clients had expressed a desire to be consulted prior to the resolution of the federal 
investigation. 
7. As explained above, one of the terms of the agreement deferring prosecution to the State of 
Florida was securing a federal remedy for the victims. In October 2007, shortly after the agreement was 
EFTA00014083
--- PAGE 3 ---
signed, four victims were contacted by telephone and these provisions were discussed. One of those 
victims wasM. who, at the time, was not represented, was given notice of the agreement. Notice was 
also provided of an expected change of plea in October 2007. When Epstein's attorneys learned that 
some of the victims had been notified, they complained that the victims were receiving an incentive to 
overstate their involvement with Mr. Epstein in order to increase their damages claims. While your 
Affiant knew that the victims' statements had been taken and corroborated with independent evidence 
well before they were informed of the potential for damages, the agents and I concluded that informing 
additional victims could compromise the witnesses' credibility at trial if Epstein reneged on the 
agreement. 
8. In mid-June, Attorney Edwards contacted your Affiant to inform me that he represented 
and i. 
and asked to meet to provide me with information regarding Epstein. I invited Attorney 
Edwards to send to me any information that he wanted me to consider. Nothing was provided. I also 
advised Attorney Edwards that he should consider contacting the State Attorney's Office, if he so 
wished. I understand that no contact with that office was made. Attorney Edwards had alluded to 
so I advised him that, to my knowledge,.. was still represented by Attorney James Eisenberg. 
9. On Friday, June 27, 2008, at approximate 4:15 p.m., your Affiant received a copy of the proposed 
state plea agreement and learned that the plea was scheduled for 8:30 a.m., Monday, June 30, 2008. 
Your Affiant, the agents, and the Palm Beach Police Department all attempted to provide notification to 
the victims, and your Affiant specifically called Attorney Edwards to provide notice to his clients 
regarding the hearing. Your Affiant believes that it was during this conversation that Attorney Edwards 
notified me that he represented, and I asked him to pass on the notice to her, as well. Attorney 
Edwards informed your Affiant that he could not attend but that someone would be present at the 
hearing. Your Affiant attended the hearing, but none of Attorney Edwards' clients was present. 
10. On today's date, your Affiant provided the attached victim notifications to 
via their 
attorney, Bradley Edwards. A notification was not provided to 
because the U.S. Attorney's 
modification limited Epstein's liability to victims whom the United States was prepared to name in an 
indictment. In light oarior 
statements to law enforcement, your Affiant could not in good faith 
include ■ 
as a victim in an indictment and, accordingly, could not include her in the list provided to 
I 
Epstein's counsel. 
EFTA00014084
--- PAGE 4 ---
11. Furthermore, with respect to the Certification of Emergency, Attorney Edwards did not ever contact 
me prior to the filing of that Certification to demand the relief that he requests in his Emergency 
Petition. On the afternoon of July 7, 2008, after your Affiant had already received the Certification of 
Emergency and Emergency Petition, I received a letter from Attorney Edwards that had been sent, via 
Certified Mail, on July 3, 2008. While that letter urges the Attorney General and the United States 
Attorney to consider "vigorous enforcement" of federal laws with respect to Jeffrey Epstein, it contains 
no demand for the relief requested in the Emergency Petition. 
12. I declare under penalty of perjury, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746 that the foregoing is true and 
correct to the best of my knowledge and belief. 
Executed this 
day of July, 2008. 
A. Marie Villafafia, Esq. 
Attorney Edwards filed his Motion on behalf of "Jane Doe," without identifying which of his clients is 
the purported victim. Accordingly, I will address facts related to 
All three of those clients 
were victims of Jeffrey Epstein's while they were minors beginning when they were fifteen years old. 
L2The undersigned does not know when Mr. Edwards began representing 
or whether ■ 
ever 
formally terminated Mr. Eisenberg's representation.

Yes. The detail that wasn't included is that he has to pay damages to the girls — a minimum of $150,000 to each

Billionaire pleads to Fla. prostitution charge 
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WEST PALM BEACH, Ha. -- New York billionaire Jeffrey Epstein has pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution 
from underage girls in South Florida. 
Circuit Judge Deborah Dale Pucillo sentenced the 55-year-old money manager Monday to 18 months in the 
Palm Beach County jail, followed by a year of house arrest. He will also be designated a sex offender. 
Epstein was arrested two years ago. Authorities allege he paid several girls under the age of 18 $200 to $300 
each in return for naked massages at his Palm Beach home that sometimes became sexual. 
He also faces state and federal lawsuits filed by several women over similar allegations.

Hi 
Funny you should ask. I have been wondering the same thing. Here is the term sheet and guidelines 
calculation that we provided at the last meeting. You and 
and I had also discussed a possible federal plea to 
an Information charging a 371 conspiracy, with a Rule 11 plea with a two-year cap, but I think 
must have 
asked Alex about it and it was nixed. Just to be prepared for tomorrow, I was just starting to draft a Rule 11 plea 
agreement in case Alex changes his mind and a formal non-prosecution agreement containing the state plea 
terms. As soon as those are ready, I will e-mail them to you. 
<Con? Plea Negotiations final.wpd>> 
There are three concerns that I hope we can address tomorrow. First, that there is an absolute drop-dead date for 
accepting or rejecting because it is strategically important that we indict before the end of September, which 
means presenting the indictment on September 25th. Second, the agents and I have not reached out to the 
victims to get their approval, which as 
politely reminded me, is required under the law. And third, I do not 
want to make any promises about allowing Epstein to self-surrender because I still believe that we have a good 
chance of getting him detained. 
On another note, Junior got a call today from the Palm Beach Police Chief because he got information that there 
will be an article released tomorrow about our meeting and that Epstein is going to plead to a state charge and 
the Chief wanted to know if the victims had been consulted about the deal. There has been some coverage in the 
New York press about Ken Starr, but I haven't seen anything local yet.

Hi Mg- 
I sent you an e-mail earlier today letting you know that Goldberger agreed to my change, so it looks like Monday is going to 
happen. I have spoken with the Chief and he also spoke to the Sheriff about serving the time out at the jail. The Chief also is going to call 
some victims to inform them that he received a call from the State Attorney's Office about a plea hearing on Monday. 
I am very surprised that there has been no press coverage. 
Yes, can we meet on Monday morning. I want to have the victim list ready to go before we head to the hearing in case we can get him to 
sign it right then and there.

Just wanted to let you knowliMand I are working on the remaining 5 girls and getting everything ready for al. Did you ever hear back 
from Jack Goldberger? I spoke with Joe yesterday and he agreed with Dave, that the PBC Detention Center is the jail. He also mentioned 
any sentenced under a year is served at the jail. If over that, Epstein will be serving at the Dept of Correction which is the Stockade. Joe 
also mentioned that the Sheriff determines how the sentence is carried out. We have already met with the Colonel at the jail some months 
ago. If all goes well tomorrow, we should ALL meet with the Colonel again just to reiterate our position. We have not heard from AMOC 
but will let you know when we do. Give us a shout later today and let us know if you would like to meet us tomorrow morning prior to 
going to the courthouse.

I have conferred with a state court practitioner who stated that there is nothing that prohibits you from agreeing to a consecutive six-month 
sentence of incarceration followed by one year of community control as specified in the non-prosecution agreement. 
If you elect to proceed with the plea agreement as currently drafted, we ask that you insert the word "imprisoned" following the words "six 
months" in the second sentencing paragraph.

Dear Roy and Jack: 
I am just writing to re-state that it is the Government's position that we have a signed, binding agreement and that there is no need for 
further modification. 
Please keep us informed of the date and time of the change of plea and sentencing. 
Thank you.

Re: 
Jeffrey Epstein 
Dear Roy: 
West Palm Beach, FL 3340! 
Facsimile: 
November 24, 2008 
On Thursday I learned that Mr. Epstein applied for and was admitted to the Palm 
Beach County Sheriff's Office's work release program and that he has been on work release 
for the past few weeks. For the following reasons, the Office believes that Mr. Epstein's 
application to and participation in the work release program is a material breach of the Non-
Prosecution Agreement. Accordingly, the United States demands that Mr. Epstein withdraw 
his application to participate in the program and complete his eighteen-month term of 
imprisonment in accordance with the Non-Prosecution Agreement. 
The Non-Prosecution Agreement provides that Epstein "shall be sentenced to 
consecutive terms of twelve (12) months and six (6) months in county jail for all charges, 
without any opportunity for withholding adjudication or sentencing, and probation or 
community control in lieu of imprisonment." I have more than a dozen e-mails between 
myself and Jay Lefkowitz discussing the U.S. Attorney's insistence on eighteen months of 
incarceration. You will recall that at one meeting you and Ms. Sanchez raised the idea of Mr. 
Epstein hiring Sheriff's Deputies to guard him as equivalent to imprisonment. Mr. Acosta 
specifically rejected that suggestion. It is our understanding from the Sheriff's Office that 
Mr. Epstein is paying off-duty Sheriff's Deputies to guard him while he "works" at Mr. 
EFTA00014110

Goldberger's office building each day. 
As you remember, shortly before Mr. Epstein's change of plea, Mr. Goldberger sent 
me a copy of the proposed plea agreement with the state. On June 27, 2008, I sent a letter 
containing the following language to you and Mr. Goldberger: 
The U.S. Attorney's Office hereby provides Notice that the proposed sentencing 
provision does no comply with the terms of the Non-Prosecution Agreement. 
The second sentencing paragraph of the proposed plea agreement reads: 
On 08CF00938 1 AM B, the Defendant is sentenced to 18 months Community Control 
I (one). As a special condition of this Communes Control, the Defendant must serve 
the first 6 months in the Palm Beach County Detention Facility . 
The Non-Prosecution Agreement specifically provides: 
Epstein shall be sentenced to consecutive terms of twelve (12) months and six (6) 
months in county jail for all charges, ... without probation or community control in 
lieu of imprisonment. 
Thus, the proposed plea agreement with the State Attorney's Office does not comply 
with the terms of the Non-Prosecution Agreement. To comply with the Agreement, 
Mr. Epstein must make a binding recommendation of eighteen months imprisonment,
which means confinement twenty-four hours a day at the County Jail, and the judge 
must accept that recommendation. Community control must follow that term of 
incarceration. 
(Emphasis in original.) 
As I specified in that letter, the Non-Prosecution Agreement calls for "confinement 
twenty-four hours a day." In response to that letter, Mr. Goldberger agreed that he would 
revise the state plea agreement to include the word "imprisonment" to make clear that Mr. 
Epstein would be incarcerated for the full eighteen months and would change the language 
of the state agreement to match the language of the federal agreement. Mr. Goldberger and 
I also discussed the situation and he made clear that Mr. Epstein would not be asking for or 
receiving work release and would remain in jail "around the clock." 
In early August, 
and I raised the same issue with you when we heard 
EFTA00014111
--- PAGE 3 ---
ROY BLACK, ESQ. 
NOVEMBER 24, 2008 
PAGE 3 Or 4 
that Mr. Epstein was considering applying for work release. On August 6, 2008, Ms. 
and I had a conference call with you wherein you again stated that Mr. Epstein 
would not apply for or receive work release and would spend his eighteen months 
incarcerated twenty-four hours a day at the Palm Beach County Stockade. 
In preparation for this letter, I obtained a certified copy of Mr. Epstein's state court 
file. On June 30, 2008, on the procurement of minors charge, Judge Pucillo entered the 
following sentence: 
The defendant is hereby committed to the custody of the Sheriff of Palm Beach 
County, Florida for a term of 6 mos. It is further ordered that the Defendant 
shall be allowed a total of 1 days [sic] as credit for time incarcerated prior to 
imposition of this sentence. It is further ordered that the composite term of all 
sentences imposed for the counts specified in the order shall run consecutive 
to the following: Specific sentences: 2006CF9454AXX. 
. . . the following provisions apply to the sentence imposed: . . . Followed by 
a period of 12 mos on community control I under the supervision of the 
Department of Corrections . . . . 
As I learned on Friday when I received the state court file, you neglected to inform 
our Office that, on July 21, 2008, Judge McSorley modified the judgment nunc pro tune to 
an "Order of Community Control I." This same language was the basis for the objection in 
my letter of June 26, 2008 and directly contradicts the language of the Non-Prosecution 
Agreement. I also note that, on the state plea agreement, Mr. Goldberger did not insert the 
word "imprisonment" as agreed prior to the change of plea, instead the words "jail sentence" 
are included. 
The Office's Agreement not to prosecute Mr. Epstein was based upon its 
determination that eighteen months' incarceration (i.e., confinement twenty-four hours a day) 
was sufficient to satisfy the federal interest in Mr. Epstein's crimes. Accordingly, the U.S. 
Attorney's Office hereby gives notice that Mr. Epstein has violated the Non-Prosecution 
Agreement by failing to remain incarcerated twenty-four hours a day for the eighteen-month

term of imprisonment. The United States will exercise any and all rights it has under the 
Non-Prosecution Agreement unless Mr. Epstein immediately ceases and desists from his 
breach of this Agreement.

As I recall, we also believed that contacting the victims would compromise them as potential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully

This is the latest letter from Brad Edwards. They are willing to agree that there are no charges against Epstein in federal court, and he 
entered pleas of guilty in state court and is incarcerated in Palm Beach County. However, they ask us to also agree to two facts regarding 
the deferral of prosecution agreement and the reason why the victims were not consulted. 
As to the reasons why the victims were not consulted, the confidentiality provision would not seem to be the reason for not consulting, 
since there was no "agreement" until Epstein and our office reached agreement in September 2007. 
The confidentiality provision was 
not binding until there was an actual agreement. My understanding is that the victims were not consulted (with the exception of the FBI 
agents meeting with 
M

in September 2007), because we did not believe the Crime Victims Rights Act applied. 
They also still want a free transcript and any FBI 302's prepared for the meeting with 
I intend to call Edwards on Monday and tell him we cannot produce the agreement due to the confidentiality provision (and not due to a 
lack of courtesy on our part). I will then ask if he still wants to meet. I will be back from Columbia on Thursday, so I can meet with 
them on Thursday or Friday. Are you available on those dates 1='?

Given the non-disclosure agreement, aren't we left with telling the SAO that we have agreed to not disclose so it wouldn't 
be proper for us to now agree that unsealing is appropriate. Ultimately, it's the SAO's call because they will get the Florida 
Public Records Act request and they were not a signatory to the agreement. We should also notify defense counsel so 
that they can take whatever actions they believe are appropriate. Wait till others have had a chance to weigh in on this

We represent The Palm Beach Daily News. The newspaper recently discovered that a non-prosecution agreement (and

the records are sealed, we cannot assess the propriety of the decision to seal them or even whether the newspaper is

I have conferred with a state court practitioner who stated that there is nothing that prohibits you from agreeing to a consecutive six-month

If you elect to proceed with the plea agreement as currently drafted, we ask that you insert the word "imprisoned" following the words "six

I have conferred with the lawyers on the team. They all thank you for agreeing to oppose any disclosure of the 9/24/07 agreement. 
We firmly believe this document is not discoverable in the civil cases. However if the court rules against you on this we request that you 
further ask that any disclosure be subject to a strong protective order prohibiting dissemination to anyone except counsel to the petitioners. 
We are particularly concerned because civil lawyers are more apt to publicize something like this than those of us who litigate on the 
criminal side of the docket. You may recall one lawyer standing on the bridge to palm beach railing over his misconceptions of the case. 
This is the typical vehicle they use to get more plaintiffs. You had also asked what documents were disclosed in the state court. As part of 
counsels obligation to fully disclose any promises or inducements which led to the plea agreement, the 9/24/07 agreement was filed with 
the court. It was filed under seal. Once again I want to re-assure you that Mr. Epstein and his counsel intend to stand by their agreements. If 
you or anyone in the USAO have any concern about a possible breach please call or email me again so we can discuss any dispute or 
misunderstanding and allay any concerns. Thanks again. Roy

AUSA 
VIA FACSIMILE 
nited States Attorney's Office 
Miami, Florida 33132 
Dear Mr. s 
I have received your July 25, 2008 letter indicating a change of course by the U.S. 
Attorney's Office and an apparent decision not to attempt to work out the undisputed 
facts in this case. If you would like :o continue trying to work out the agreed facts then, 
of course, we are willing to continue to work with you towards that goal. If, as you 
suggested, that would be unproductive given the limited issues the Court needs to decide, 
then please consider some additional paints below that may help to expedite this matter 
for the Court. 
As indicated in your letter, your current position is that the victims' rights were 
not yet triggered because no case was filed against Jeffrey Epstein. Consequently, your 
letter indicates that you will be presenting only two facts to the Court, namely: 
there are no charges in the District Court filed against Jeffrey Epstein; and 
(2) 
Jeffrey Epstein entered pleas of guilty in Florida State Court on June 30, 
2008, was sentenced, and is now imprisoned in Palm Beach County. 
We can certainly agree to those two facts. I am writing to see whether you would 
also be willing to include two additional uncontested facts in your Notice to the Court. 
The facts we would like you to include are: 
(3) 
As a result of the guilty pleas in Florida State Court entered on June 30, 
2008, there is currently in place a "non-prosecution" agreement between Jeffrey Epstein 
and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida that precludes filing of 
federal criminal charges against Jeffrey Epstein for federal sex crimes committed against 
the victims in this matter. 
(4) 
While this non-prosecution agreement was negotiated between the U.S. 
Attorney's Office and Jeffrey Epstein in September 2007 (and amended twice more 
during that year), the victims and their attorneys were not told about the non-prosecution 
agreement until after June 30, 2008, because of an express confidentiality provision in the 
agreement that the U.S. Attorney's Office, the FBI, and other federal agents all complied 
with.

In suggesting these stipulations, I am not foreclosing presenting other facts on 
behalf of the victims if the Court determines that other facts are necessary to have before 
the Court in order to effectively rule on these issues. It just seems to me that points (3) 
and (4) are so obviously uncontested, that your office would be willing to stipulate to 
them and make those facts available to the Court for consideration. 
It is unclear from your recent letter whether you intend to give the victims the 
courtesy of seeing the fiill and complete non-prosecution agreement that was signed by 
the parties and that now covers their case. 
Your previous proposed stipulation of 
undisputed facts stated: "On July 9, 2008, AUSA 
sent a victim notification to 
Jane Doe #1 via her attorney, Bradley Edwards, which is attached as Exhibit 6 to the 
Declaration. That notification contains a written explanation of the full terms 
of the agreement between Epstein and the U.S. Attorney's Office." While it appears by 
this statement to have been your intent to provide the victims with a true and accurate 
copy of that non-prosecution agreement, that agreement has not yet been produced to 
them. While it is likely a mere oversight on your part, we would again request a true and 
accurate copy of the complete non-prosecution agreement that apparently bars federal 
prosecution of the man who committed sexual crimes against my clients. 
Additionally, we would request again that if statements of my clients were taken 
by FBI agents or your office, that those interview reports containing those statements he 
produced to us. Finally, I continue to request that you assist the victims in this case by 
securing a transcript of the hearing on their petition. Your letter did not address that 
request, and we would hope that your office would assist the innocent and indigent 
victims in this ease by providing that transcript. 
Thank you for your attention to these concerns. 
Sincerely, 
BE/sg

Dear 
, This is a message I tried to send on the 20th. I got a notification back that it did not go through, so I'm trying 
this different address. 
In your notification letter about JE's work release that you wrote to the victims you mentioned the possibility of their 
notifying you if they wanted any of their addresses made off limits on his mechanical device that restricts him. First, if he is 
only going to and from that office address, why does he need to be mechanically otherwise restricted? Second, should one 
of the victims want to designate an address where she lives or works to be programmed as off limits, is it possible for him 
to then have access to the name of the victim and the specific location from which he is being restricted? 
Wishing you a peaceful and happy holiday! Kathy

I would feel more comfortable with something that says: 
Thank you for your letter. The Office is involved in the criminal investigation of Mr. Epstein and is neither a party to nor 
involved in any civil suits against him. If you have any documentary evidence thatyou believe establishes a breach of the 
Non-Prosecution Agreement, you can forward that evidence to AUS 
The Office will then conduct its 
own review in accordance with the terms of the Non-Prosecution Agreement. 
And leave it at that. What do you all think?

Judge Cassell and Brad, 
I have incorporated the change suggested by Judge Cassell to paragraph (c). I also added language in paragraph (e), 
referring to other victims, which also provides for petitioners' counsel to promptly provide a copy of the acknowledgment 
to the U.S. Attorney's Office. 
The government has no doubts that counsel for petitioners will ensure the authorized 
recipients are aware of the protective order and agree to abide by it, prior to disclosure. We do not require the 
acknowledgment in writing prior to the non-prosecution agreement being disclosed to an authorized recipient. 
We believe the petitioners' proposed protective order goes well beyond what is at issue, the government's disclosure of 
the non-prosecution agreement, conditioned on limited dissemination of the document upon receipt by petitioners. 
Consequently, we believe the attached proposed order, incorporating your revisions, is appropriate for the task at 
hand. Thanks.

Hello 
and 
First, I don't know if we've been formally introduced. Nice to meet you ... electronically at least. 
Second, on the language -- As Brad mentioned, we need to see this document quite quickly in view of 
the Government's representations yesterday that Epstein is trying to ignore the agreement. As a result --
and in view of the difficulty of making immediate contact with our clients -- I propose one change. 
Instead of this: 
Prior to producing the documents to Petitioners' counsel, a copy of this Order must be provided to 
counsel and their clients, who must review and acknowledge their receipt of and agreement to abide by 
the terms of this Order, and who must provide a copy of that acknowledgment to the USAO. 
How about this: 
Before counsel for Petitioner's show the agreement to their clients or discuss the specific terms with 
them, they must provide a copy of this Order to Petitioners, who must review and acknowledge their 
EFTA00014133
--- PAGE 2 ---
receipt of and agreement to abide by the terms of this Order. Counsel for Petitioner's must promptly 
provide a copy of that acknowledgment to the USAO. 
I assume that the USAO is not concerned about us as attorneys somehow ignoring the Court's protective 
order, so this change would focus in on the non-law trained clients.

Dear Colonel Gauger: 
Thank you for taking the time to meet with us on Tuesday. As we discussed, I have attached the pertinent portion of Mr. Epstein's 
agreement with the U.S. Attorney's Office. 
«Epstein Agrmt Portion.pdf» 
I also wanted to call to your attention a couple of items regarding the issue of Work Release. During the change of plea, Mr. Epstein stated 
that he would be working at the Florida Science Foundation, located at 250 Australian Avenue, Suite 1400, that the Foundation had been in 
existence for a "couple of years," and that he had been working there "every day" prior to the plea. The Division of Corporations' 
documents show that the Florida Science Foundation was incorporated in November 2007, not a "couple of years ago." The address 
provided for the "office" of the Florida Science Foundation is Jack Goldberger's office suite, and neither the office building directory nor 
the office suite door reflects that such a business is located there, and neither the security guard nor any building tenant that FBI questioned 
knows of the existence of such a business. Mr. Epstein also could not have been working there "every day" when he hadn't been in Palm 
Beach County in the past six months. 
I would appreciate the opportunity to review the work release regulations. If Mr. Epstein truly is eligible for the program, we have no 
objection to him being treated like any other similarly situated prisoner, but sitting in his attorney's office suite making telephone calls, 
web-surfing, and having food delivered to him is probably not in accordance with the objectives of imprisonment. Obviously, the decision 
is left entirely within your discretion, but I wanted to make sure that you had a complete picture before you made that decision. 
Thank you again, and have a wonderful 4th of July.

Dear Mr. White: 
Please feel free to make your own travel arrangements, but if you would like Ms. 
travel costs to be 
reimbursed, they must be made through the government's approved agency on the approved carriers. 
Regarding the immunity, at this point, without a written proffer from you regarding the substance of her 
anticipated testimony, I believe that the more prudent course will be to question Ms. 
to determine the 
limits of her Fifth Amendment exposure and, if necessary, to apply to the Court at that time. If you provide 
me with a written proffer that summarizes her anticipated testimony and explains how she will be exposed to 
criminal liability, then I can make the motion ahead of time. Your written statement would be treated as an 
attorney statement made in the course of confidential plea discussions and related negotiations, and would be 
governed by Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(0 and Fed. R. Evid. 410.

Re: Jeffrey Epstein 
Dear Jay and Roy: 
Thank you for your letter of August 22nd. I write to follow up on some of the points that 
you raised. 
The list of thirty-two victims that was provided to Mr. Goldberger via certified mail on 
July 10, 2008 is the final list. As I mentioned, copies of the notification letters to each victim will 
be carbon-copied to an attorney for Mr. Epstein and Mr. Josefsberg. I asked you to advise me 
whether Mr. Goldberger should continue to be listed as the contact person for the civil litigation 
in the amended victim notification letters and whether he should receive the carbon copies of 
those letters as they are sent. 
I also asked you to provide me with written confirmation of your agreement to pay Mr. 
Josefsberg's fees. Please provide me with that confirmation so that Mr. Josefsberg can begin his 
representation. 
I have conferred with the lead AUSA in the case of Jane Doe 1 and 2 v. United States , and 
he agrees that, based upon the discussion with Judge Marra during the hearing on the plaintiffs' 
motion, a notification of the judge's ruling is required. I will, however, change the language 
slightly to direct the victims to discuss the matter with Mr. Josefsberg. 
With regard to your concerns with my "open-ended description of Mr. Epstein's 
responsibilities regarding civil restitution," I agree that the resolution of civil damages claims is 
as stated in paragraphs 7 and 8 of the Agreement and Addendum. That is why the language in the 
notification is taken verbatim from paragraphs 7, 8, and 7C of the Agreement and Addendum, 
except that the victim's name is used in place of "identified individual." As I mentioned in my 
earlier letter, if you have any proposed substantive changes, please provide them to me. 
Mr. Goldberger and Mr. Tein explicitly approved the language in my earlier victim 
notification letter, even though they apparently were taking the position that the December 19, 
2007 letter was not part of the Agreement, so that misinformation was provided to the victims 
with the approval of Mr. Epstein's attorneys. 
With regard to your sixth and seventh points, I reiterate that it is the Office's position that 
the Agreement and Addendum speak for themselves. Let me also reiterate that, while the Office 
does not intend to involve itself in any civil negotiations or litigation, if it comes to our attention 
EFTA00014144
--- PAGE 2 ---
that Mr. Epstein has breached the terms of the Agreement, the Office intends to enforce its right 
to indict Mr. Epstein. 
I would appreciate a prompt response to the question regarding which of Mr. Epstein's 
attorneys should be named in and receive copies of the notification letters, as well as 
documentation of your commitment to paying Mr. Josefsberg's fees so that I may begin 
distributing the revised victim notifications on Wednesday morning. 
Sincerely, 
R. Alexander Acosta

I am the Assistant United States Attorney assigned to the investigation of Jeffrey 
Epstein. The case was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI"). The federal 
investigation was initiated in 2006 at the request of the Palm Beach Police Department ("PBPD") 
into allegations that Jeffrey Epstein and his personal assistants had used facilities of interstate 
commerce to induce young girls between the ages of thirteen and seventeen to engage in prostitution, 
amongst other offenses. 
Throughout the investigation, when a victim was identified, victim notification letters 
were provided to her both from your Affiant and from the FBI's Victim-Witness Specialist. Attached 
hereto are copies of the letters provided to Bradley Edwards' three clients, 
Your Affiant's letter to IM was provided by the FBI. (Ex. 1). Your Affiant's letter to 
was 
hand-delivered by myself to 
at the time that she was interviewed (Ex. 2). F2 Both Eland 
also received letters from the FBI's Victim-Witness Specialist, which were sent on January 10, 
2008 (Exs. 3 & 4). ■was identified via the FBI's investigation in 2007, but she initially refused to 
speak with investigators. 
s status as a victim of a federal offense was confirmed when she was 
EFTA00014146
--- PAGE 2 ---
interviewed by federal agents on May 28, 2008. The FBI's Victim-Witness Specialist sent a letter to 
M. on May 30, 2008 (Ex. 5). 
3. 
Throughout the investigation, the FBI agents, the FBI's Victim-Witness Specialist, and 
your Affiant had contact with Mland 
Attorney Edwards' other client, MI, was represented 
by counsel and, accordingly, all contact with 
was made through that attorney. That attorney was 
James Eisenberg, and his fees were paid by Jeffrey Epstein, the target of the investigation. Fs 
4. 
In the summer of 2007, Mr. Epstein and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern 
District of Florida ("the Office") entered into negotiations to resolve the investigation. At that time, 
Mr. Epstein had been charged by the State of Florida with solicitation of prostitution, in violation of 
Florida Statutes § 796.07. Mr. Epstein's attorneys sought a global resolution of the matter. The 
United States subsequently agreed to defer federal prosecution in favor of prosecution by the State of 
Florida, so long as certain basic preconditions were met. One of the key objectives for the 
Government was to preserve a federal remedy for the young girls whom Epstein had sexually 
exploited. Thus, one condition of that agreement, notice of which was provided to the victims on 
July 9, 2008, is the following: 
"Any person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an offense enumerated in 
Title 18, United States Code, Section 2255, will have the same rights to proceed under 
Section 2255 as she would have had, if Mr. Epstein had been tried federally and convicted 
of an enumerated offense. For purposes of implementing this paragraph, the United States 
shall provide Mr. Epstein's attorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to 
name in an Indictment as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein. Any judicial 
authority interpreting this provision, including any authority determining which 
evidentiary burdens if any a plaintiff must meet, shall consider that it is the intent of the 
parties to place these identified victims in the same position as they would have been had 
Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less." 
1. 
An agreement was reached in September 2007. The Agreement contained an express 
confidentiality provision. 
2. 
Although individual victims were not consulted regarding the agreement, several had 
expressed concerns regarding the exposure of their identities at trial and they desired a prompt 
resolution of the matter. At the time the agreement was signed in September 2007, 
was openly 
hostile to the prosecution of Epstein. The FBI attempted to interview ■in 
October 2007, at which 
time she refused to provide any information regarding Jeffrey Epstein. None of Attorney Edwards' 
clients had expressed a desire to be consulted prior to the resolution of the federal investigation. 
EFTA00014147
--- PAGE 3 ---
3. 
As explained above, one of the terms of the agreement deferring prosecution to the 
State of Florida was securing a federal remedy for the victims. In October 2007, shortly after the 
agreement was signed, four victims were contacted and these provisions were discussed. One of 
those victims was ■ 
who at the time was not represented, and she was given notice of the 
agreement. Notice was also provided of an expected change of plea in October 2007. When 
Epstein's attorneys learned that some of the victims had been notified, they complained that the 
victims were receiving an incentive to overstate their involvement with Mr. Epstein in order to 
increase their damages claims. While your Affiant knew that the victims' statements had been taken 
and corroborated with independent evidence well before they were informed of the potential for 
damages, the agents and I concluded that informing additional victims could compromise the 
witnesses' credibility at trial if Epstein reneged on the agreement. 
4. 
After 
had been notified of the terms of the agreement, but before Epstein 
performed his obligations, 
contacted the FBI because Epstein's counsel was attempting to take 
her deposition and private investigators were harassing her. Your Affiant secured pro bono counsel to 
represent 
and several other identified victims. Pro bono counsel was able to assist 
in 
avoiding the improper deposition. That pro bono counsel did not express to your Affiant that 
was dissatisfied with the resolution of the matter. 
5. 
In mid-June 2008, Attorney Edwards contacted your Affiant to inform me that he 
represented 
and 
and asked to meet to provide me with information regarding Epstein. I 
invited Attorney Edwards to send to me any information that he wanted me to consider. Nothing was 
provided. I also advised Attorney Edwards that he should consider contacting the State Attorney's 
Office, if he so wished. I understand that no contact with that office was made. Attorney Edwards 
had alluded to
 so I advised him that, to my knowledge, ■ 
was still represented by Attorney 
James Eisenberg. 
6. 
On Friday, June 27, 2008, at approximate 4:15 p.m., your Affiant received a copy of the 
proposed state plea agreement and learned that the plea was scheduled for 8:30 a.m., Monday, June 
30, 2008. Your Affiant and the Palm Beach Police Department attempted to provide notification to 
victims in the short time that Epstein's counsel had given us. Although all known victims were not 
notified, your Affiant specifically called attorney Edwards to provide notice to his clients regarding 
the hearing. 
Your Affiant believes that it was during this conversation that Attorney Edwards 
EFTA00014148
--- PAGE 4 ---
notified me that he represented 
and I assumed that he would pass on the notice to her, as well. 
Attorney Edwards informed your Affiant that he could not attend but that someone would be present 
at the hearing. Your Affiant attended the hearing, but none of Attorney Edwards' clients was present. 
7. 
On today's date, your Affiant provided the attached victim notifications to 
and 
■ 
via their attorney, Bradley Edwards. A notification was not provided to 
because the U.S. 
Attorney's modification limited Epstein's liability to victims whom the United States was prepared to 
name in an indictment. In light of -s 
prior statements to law enforcement, your Affiant could not 
in good faith include■ as a victim in an indictment and, accordingly, could not include her in the 
list provided to Epstein's counsel. 
8. 
Furthermore, with respect to the Certification of Emergency, Attorney Edwards did not 
ever contact me prior to the filing of that Certification to demand the relief that he requests in his 
Emergency Petition. On the afternoon of July 7, 2008, after your Affiant had already received the 
Certification of Emergency and Emergency Petition, I received a letter from Attorney Edwards that 
had been sent, via Certified Mail, on July 3, 2008. While that letter urges the Attorney General and 
the United States Attorney to consider "vigorous 
enforcement" of federal laws with respect to Jeffrey Epstein, it contains no demand for the relief 
requested in the Emergency Petition. 
1. 
I declare under penalty of perjury, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746 that the foregoing is 
true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief. 
Executed this 
day of July, 2008. 
Attorney Edwards filed his Motion on behalf of "Jane Doe," without identi ing which of his clients is 
the purported victim. Accordingly, I will address facts related to 
All three of those clients 
were victims of Jeffrey Epstein's while they were minors beginning when they were fifteen years old. 
aPlease note that the dates on the U.S. Attorney's Office letters to 
I are not the dates that 
the letters were actually delivered. Letters to all known victims were prepared early in the investigation and 
delivered as each victim was contacted. 
F3The undersigned does not know when Mr. Edwards began representing 
or whether 
ever 
formally terminated Mr. Eisenberg's representation.

EPSTEIN EYES SEX-RAP RELIEF 
October 9, 2007 -- LAWYERS for Jeffrey Epstein - the billionaire Manhattan 
investment manager who's agreed to plead guilty to soliciting underage 
prostitutes at his Palm Beach mansion in exchange for just 18 months in the 
slammer - are mulling asking federal prosecutors to drop their demand that he 
register as a sex offender. In a letter drafted, but not sent, to U.S. Attomey 
Alexander Costa and obtained by Page Six, Epstein's lawyer, Gerald 
Lefcourt, writes, "Doing so will have a profound impact [on Epstein] both 
immediately and forever after. Not only will he be restricted to a wholly 
inappropriate penal facility, but he will be required for the rest of his life to 
account for his whereabouts." Epstein, a former business partner of Daily 
News owner Mort Zuckerman, pleaded guilty to a state charge in exchange 
for the feds' dropping their probe into possible federal criminal violations. 
Lefcourt argues that only the feds have demanded that Epstein register, 
"despite the fact that the state was of the view that Mr. Epstein's conduct did 
not warrant registration? A rep for Epstein had no comment.

Hi Barry — The Non-Prosecution Agreement contains a confidentiality provision that requires us to inform Mr. 
Epstein's counsel before making any disclosure — even a compulsory disclosure. I am cc'ing you on a letter to 
Jay Lefkowitz, Roy Black, and Jack Goldberger informing them of the request and asking them, as parties to the 
criminal case, to contact you regarding a possible suit by the Shiny Sheet. 
On another note, I also will be informing them that I believe that they still have not filed the complete agreement 
with the Court, as required by the Judge at the hearing. 
Thank you very much for reaching out to us when you received this request, and if you need any help from us, 
please let us know.

Subject: Epstein -- Upcoming Court Dates and Motion filed by Palm Beach Post 
Hi all — It is the summer, so Epstein must be back in full swing. There are two court hearings next week that we 
have been given notice of (one of which we have been "invited" to attend), and we need to discuss our position 
before I attend. Here are the most recent items: 
1. Judge Marra has asked us to appear on Friday, June 12th to address whether "Epstein's defense of the 
civil suits breaches the Non-Prosecution Agreement." 
2. The Palm Beach Post has filed a motion to intervene in one of the state court civil suits in order to ask the 
judge to unseal the Non-Prosecution Agreement. 
3. A hearing on the motion to unseal in state court is set for Wednesday, June 10'h. We have been given 
notice of that hearing, along with Michael McAuliffe from the State Attorney's Office. 
4. On May 26, 2009, Epstein's counsel filed a pleading in federal court that essentially argues that the civil 
claims filed under 18 USC 2255 must all be dismissed (i.e., that he can never be held liable under that 
statute) because he was not convicted of any federal offense. This directly contradicts the Non-
Prosecution Agreement, wherein Epstein agreed that if any identified victim elects to file suit pursuant to 
USC 2255, "Epstein will not contest the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the 
Southern District of Florida over his person and/or the subject matter, and Epstein waives his right to 
contest liability . . ." At this point, I believe that Epstein is probably in breach of the Agreement. I will 
gather the documentation related to this for your review. We are required to provide him with "timely 
notice" of his breach and file an indictment within 60 days of learning of the breach. That means that we 
need to indict by July 24th — my= birthday! 
5. Several litigants have asked Judge Marra to unseal the Non-Prosecution Agreement. No hearing has been 
set on those motions. 
Can we do a conference call on Thursday afternoon or Friday morning to discuss? There are a number of things 
that we have to do before we provide notice of breach, so time is of the essence. I can drive down to Miami on

Subject: Epstein issue with State Attorney's Office 
Date: Tue, 04 Aug 2009 17:16:38 +0000 
Importance: Normal 
It is Tuesday, so there must be a new issue with Epstein. This one potentially involves the Palm Beach County 
State Attorney's Office so I included poor 
on the email chain. 
Here are the two issues: 
First, I have heard from several sources that Epstein is trying to convince (or perhaps has already convinced) the 
SAO to give him "cooperation credit" to shorten the length of his home confinement based upon "cooperation" 
that he is giving to the Feds in the Bernie Madoff case. As you probably remember, a couple of weeks ago some 
newspapers reported that Epstein is cooperating with FBI in the Madoff prosecution and that was the real reason 
for him receiving such a light sentence. After those newspaper reports came out, the AUSA prosecuting the 
Madoff case called me asking who Epstein was and stating in no uncertain terms that Epstein is not cooperating. 
Nonetheless, I can imagine our good friends (Goldberger, Lefkowitz, and others) telling the SAO that Epstein 
actually is cooperating and that the USA() agrees that he should have his sentence reduced. Now, this could all 
be rumor, but 
and I have heard it from so many different places (Town of Palm Beach PD, plaintiffs' 
attorneys, etc.), that it seems like someone should reach out to the SAO to make sure that they aren't beinr, 
any lies. I, of course, am happy to do so, but I didn't know if you felt that the contact should be made by 
Or 
I also just pulled the state docket sheet and found another motion to "correct" Epstein's sentence that we were 
never told about. Docket entry 7 in the procurement of child prostitution case reads: "Agreed Order that the 
Order of Community Control is Corrected to Delete Special Condition #26 and #27." Something tells me that 
there was no "correction," this was a "change" that takes out things we considered important. 
Can 
you get this from the courthouse and fax it to me? Case number is 502008CF009381AXXXMB. 
Second, if new allegations or new victims come to light, are we allowed to investigate their claims? If we 
cannot, or if there is jurisdiction in another district, can we refer to allegations to another USAO to investigate? 
There are two very specific items that I would like to investigate further that relate to the S.D.FI.. Also, as you 
recall, we never were able to advance our investigation regarding the New York victims, and none of them were 
included in our list of identified victims. The prosecutors on the Madoff case have asked if they can use some of 
our evidence — or at least speak with me and the FBI agents -- to prosecute Epstein regarding conduct in New 
York. 
Thank you.

Hi all — I have attached a letter I just received from Roy Black. The odd thing about this is that it is addressed 
directly to me. Roy (and Epstein's team) always sends everything to Jeff or someone far more important than me. 
I haven't seen the Complaint against the Rothstein firm yet, but I did have a voicemail from Brad Edwards this 
morning, which I haven't responded to. 
Can someone fill me in on any developments? When I receive the criminal complaint I will send the copies out

E-Mail: 
You emailed me a letter on November 2, asking whether Jeffrey Epstein's 
place of employment remained constant. It has. I reviewed a Google map to 
confirm that the distance between that place of employment and the location 
where he was stopped by Palm Beach Police is less than 3 miles (and that the 
location where he was walking was on a direct mute to his place of work). 
It has taken us a while to respond to your letter because other matters have 
consumed our time and effort. Over the past five weeks, the massive billion-dollar 
conspiracy created and run by Scott Rothstein has been exposed. On Monday, 
Mr. Epstein filed a state civil RICO lawsuit charging Rothstein, his partner Brad 
Edwards, and others with tortuous and fraudulent abuses of process that resulted 
in serious injury to Mr. Epstein. A copy of the Complaint is enclosed with this 
letter. 
As ou know, Rothstein's firm represents 
and 
three of the plaintiffs who have brought civil actions against Mr. 
Epstein. The Rothstein firm was a criminal enterprise that used the litigation 
against Mr. Epstein to lure investors into its billion-dollar ponzi scheme. We 
believe that Rothstein and his co-conspirators used the government's criminal 
investigation as a means to perpetrate and further their fraud. For example:

1. The Rothstein lawyers sought disclosure of the NPA to prove who the 
victims were, and used the NPA to "corroborate" their false claims. 
2. Rothstein and his co-conspirators abused the legal process in other 
cases. They forged the signature of judges, and even forged an Eleventh Circuit 
opinion. 
3. Rothstein lawyers demanded phony protective orders. 
4. In our case, they sought discovery of Epstein's plane logs to fish for 
celebrities to extort and convince investors that huge amounts of settlement 
money was available from them. 
5. Rothstein lawyers litigated claims using Jane Doe names to make the 
phony settlements appear plausible to investors, and also to prevent any 
investigation into the claims by the investors. 
6. Rothstein and others told investors that your office directed the women 
to the Rothstein firm. 
7. Rothstein and his co-conspirators gathered information illegally, and 
shared it with the other plaintiffs' attorneys in this case. 
8. Rothstein deceived investors into believing that he had the confidential 
victim list you prepared, and that he had a copy of the NPA. 
9. 
Rothstein told investors that his investigators had sophisticated 
electronic bugging equipment to gather evidence against Epstein. 
10. Rothstein told investors that Epstein had offered to settle the cases for 
$200 million, when there have been no such discussions about any settlement at 
any price. 
And it does not stop there. Rothstein, his partners, and his employees 
investigated and litigated the M, 
and 
cases with funds derived 
from their criminal enterprise and their fraud and misrepresentations to investors. 
But we have been stymied from debunking fraudulent claims brought by the 
Rothstein criminal enterprise because you have threatened that such action on 
Black Srebnick. Komspan & Stumpf, PA

our part would constitute a breach of the NPA. So the Rothstein lawyers, once 
again, are using the power of the federal government to perpetrate and further 
their fraud. And the expense of litigating these cases has been extreme. For 
example, 
who I do not believe was aware of the Rothstein crimes, 
is now demanding over $2 million in legal fees. 
As a lawsuit brought by some of the investors' claims, Rothstein and his 
partner Edwards used Jeffrey Epstein as bait. The litigation strategy, media 
pronouncements, and investigatory initiatives of Rothstein and Edwards were 
calculated to support Rothstein's deceptions rather than to advance the position 
of his clients. I bring these facts to your attention so that if you had contact with 
Edwards or those associated with him in the past concerning Mr. Epstein, you 
consider not continuing communications with any of them in the future. 
I would like a short conference with you in person to talk about Mr. 
Epstein's progress through the state criminal justice system, to discuss several 
outstanding issues that I want to make sure you have accurate information about, 
and, from my perspective, most importantly, so that I can provide Mr. Epstein 
with proper counsel going forward. If you email me some dates when you are 
available this month, we can schedule a short meeting in your office hopefully 
before the year ends.

Case 9:08-cv-80119-KAM 
Document 34 
Entered on FLSD Docket 08705:2008 
Page 1 of 2 
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA 
NO. 08-80119-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON 
JANE DOE NO. 2, 
Plaintiff, 
v. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
Defendant. 
ORDER DENYING MOTION TO SEAL 
THIS CAUSE comes before the Court on Defendant Jeffrey Epstein's Motion to File 
Under Seal, filed July 28, 2008. Defendant seeks to file his reply to his Motion to Stay under 
seal.' The Court has carefully considered the motion and the record and is otherwise fully 
advised in the premises. 
As the Court has previously explained to the parties, the Local Rules for the Southern 
District of Florida state that "proceedings in the United States District Court are public and Court 
filings are matters of public record." S.D. Fla. L.R. 5.4(A). It is well settled that the media and 
the public in general possess a common-law right to inspect and copy judicial records. See Nixon 
v. Warner Communications, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 597 (1978). "The right to inspect and copy 
records is not absolute, however. As with other forms of access, it may interfere with the 
administration of justice and hence may have to be curtailed." Newman v. Graddick, 696 F.2d 
'The parties are reminded that all documents filed conventionally (including those filed 
under seal) must be filed with the Clerk's Office in West Palm Beach, Florida. 
EFTA00014185
--- PAGE 2 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80119-KAM 
Document 34 
Entered on FLSD Docket 08/05/2008 
Page 2 of 2 
796, 803 (11th Cir.1983). This right of access creates a presumption in favor of openness of court 
records, which "must be balanced against any competing interest advanced." United States v. 
Noriega, 752 F. Supp. 1037, 1040 (S.D. Fla.1990). For example, courts may look to see whether 
the records sought are for illegitimate purposes. Newman, 696 F.2d at 803. Likewise, the Court 
may consider whether "the press has already been permitted substantial access to the contents of 
the records." Id. 
In his motion to seal, Defendant states that he seeks to file this document under seal "to 
comply with the confidentiality clause" in the agreement between Defendant and the U.S. 
Attorney cited in his brief. (Def. Mot. 2.) The Court is familiar with the U.S. Attorney's 
objections to unsealing any part of the agreement, see In re: Jane Doe, No. 08-80736-CIV (S.D. 
Fla. July 11, 2008). However, as the Court has previously held, the U.S. Attorney's objections 
do not outweigh the public interest in having access to court records. Further, the details of the 
agreement contained in Defendant's Reply brief have, in large part, already been unsealed and 
released to the public. The Court finds no justification to keep these documents under seal. 
Accordingly, it is ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that Defendant's Motion to File 
Under Seal is DENIED. The Clerk shall UNSEAL docket entries 29 and 30 and make them 
available for public inspection through CM/ECF at the earliest possible time. 
DONE AND ORDERED in Chambers at West Palm Beach, Palm Beach County, 
Florida, this 4ih day of August, 2008.

JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
Defendant. 
ORDER DENYING MOTION TO STAY 
THIS CAUSE comes before the Court on Defendant Jeffrey Epstein's Motion to Stay 
(DE 12), filed June 20, 2008. The motion is now fully briefed and is ripe for review. The Court 
has carefully considered the motion and is otherwise fully advised in the premises. 
Defendant Jeffrey Epstein ("Defendant") seeks a stay of this civil action under a federal 
statute which reads, in pertinent part, as follows: 
If, at any time that a cause of action for recovery of compensation for 
damage or injury to the person of a child exists, a criminal action is 
pending which arises out of the same occurrence and in which the child is 
the victim, the civil action shall be stayed until the end of all phases of the 
criminal action and any mention of the civil action during the criminal 
proceeding is prohibited. As used in this subsection, a criminal action is 
pending until its final adjudication in the trial court. 
U.S.C. § 3509 (k). In his motion, Defendant cites a state case, Florida v. Epstein, No. 2006

CF 09454AXX (Fla. Cir. Ct. 2008)' and a federal case, hr re Grand Jury, No. FGJ 07-103(WPB) 
(S.D. Fla.), that arise out of the same occurrences and are pending and thus require a stay of this 
civil case. The federal "case," according to Defendant, involves a "deferred-prosecution" 
agreement whereby the U.S. Attorney agreed to suspend its investigation of Defendant while 
"retaining the right to reactivate the grand jury." (DE 24.) Defendant essentially reasons, 
because the U.S. Attorney could bring criminal charges against Defendant, that a criminal action 
is "pending." The Court rejects this definition of a "pending criminal action." 
When interpreting the text of a statute, the Court begins with the plain meaning of the 
text. In re Hedrick, 524 F.3d 1175, 1186 (11'h Cir. 2008). If the plain meaning of a statute is 
clear, the Court should not deviate from that interpretation. Id. Pending is defined as "remaining 
undecided" and "awaiting decision." Blacks Law Dictionary (81h ed. 2004).2 Likewise, an 
'As Defendant recognizes, the state court case was "finally adjudicated" and thus no 
longer pending as of June 30, 2008. (See DE 12.) 
'Defendant attempts to argue that the fact that grand jury subpoenas are still 
"outstanding" and "not withdrawn" and that the grand jury will not be dismissed until Defendant 
completes his obligations under the state plea agreement means that a "criminal action" is 
"pending." (Def. Reply 4.) Defendant misunderstands the purpose of a grand jury. A grand 
jury, as Blackstone writes, is composed of citizens who "inquire, upon their oaths, whether there 
be sufficient cause to call upon the party to answer" the charge of criminal activity. Beavers v. 
Henkel, 194 U.S. 73, 84 (1904) (quoting William Blackstone, 4 Commentaries *303). The grand 
jury's sole purpose is to inquire into whether there is probable cause to bring an individual before 
a tribunal to determine his guilt or innocence of an alleged crime. Id. The grand jury is simply 
an investigative body. See U.S v. Aired, 144, F.3d 1405, 1413 (111h Cir. 1998). A "criminal 
action" is not instigated by the calling of a grand jury, because a grand jury is convened "to 
determine whether a crime has been committed and whether criminal proceedings should be 
instituted against any person." U.S. v. Calandra, 414 U.S. 338, 344 (1974). An "action" is 
commenced against a person after the grand jury actually finds probable cause to make an 
individual answer specific charges and renders a bill of indictment against that individual. Until 
a grand jury's investigation is complete and there has been a determination by a lawful authority 
that probable cause exists, there can be no criminal action.

"action" is defined as a "criminal judicial proceeding." Id. Because the U.S. Attorney has not 
filed an indictment or an information against Defendant, the Court fails to see how there is an 
undecided judicial proceeding in federal court against Defendant. 
Defendant argues that this statute should be read to include the definition of "criminal 
action" used in 18 U.S.C. § I595(b)(2), which reads as follows: "In this subsection, a 'criminal 
action' includes investigation and prosecution and is pending until final adjudication in the trial 
court." Defendant argues that "Congress specifically intended that the term 'criminal action' 
would be applied extremely broadly" under § 1595, so Congress "took pains to ensure that courts 
would give it the broadest possible construction" and defined "criminal action" as including 
investigatory stages. (Def. Reply 4.) Defendants argue that the Court should borrow this 
definition. 
The Court disagrees. The Court believes that Congress's inclusion of this broader 
definition under § 1595 evinces Congressional intent to depart from the normal meaning of the 
term "criminal action."' This addition to the text suggests that Congress knows the plain 
meaning of the term "criminal action" and that Congress decided, under § 1595, that the 
definition of "criminal action" should be broader. In contrast, Congress could have made such an 
addition to § 3509 had it intended the mandatory stay provision to apply to pre-indictment 
investigations, but it did not. In other words, by not broadening the definition of "criminal 
action" § 3509, Congress intended that the term should only have its ordinary meaning: that an 
indictment or information has been filed naming a specific defendant. Instead, it seems clear that 
'In fact, Congress made this intent clear by stating that this broader definition of a 
"criminal action" applied only "in this subsection."

Congress intended that these two statutory provisions should each have a different scope. 
Defendant's argument of statutory construction fails. 
The single case cited by Defendant in support of his motion is not on point. In Doe 1 v. 
Francis, No. 5:03CV260/MCR/WCS, 2005 WL 517847 (N.D. Fla. Feb. 10, 2005), the stay was 
entered because criminal charges had been filed against the defendant in a state court several 
months earlier (i.e., the defendants had been indicted by the state attorney). See Memorandum in 
Support of Motion to Stay Proceedings Pending Outcome of Parallel Criminal Proceedings at 3, 
Doe 1 v. Francis, No. 5:03CV260/MCRIWCS (N.D. Fla. Dec. 2, 2003). The Court agrees with 
Defendant that a stay under § 3509(k) is mandatory when a criminal action is pending; the Court 
simply disagrees that the "deferred-prosecution agreement" constitutes a pending criminal action. 
The Court also does not believe a discretionary stay is warranted. Defendant did not seek 
this relief in his motion; including such a request in the reply brief is inappropriate. Further, the 
Court sees no reason to delay this litigation for the next thirty-three months. After all, Defendant 
is in control of his own destiny - it is up to him (and him alone) whether the plea agreement 
reached with the State of Florida is breached. If Defendant does not breach the agreement, then 
he should have no concerns regarding his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. The 
fact that the U.S. Attorney (or other law enforcement officials) may object to some discovery in 
these civil cases is not, in an of itself, a reason to stay the civil action. Any such issues shall be 
resolved as they arise in the course of this litigation. 
Accordingly, it is ORDERED AND ADJUDGED as follows: 
I. Defendant's Motion to Stay (DE 12) is DENIED. 
2. Defendant's Motion for Hearing (DE 27) is DENIED AS MOOT.

I scheduled this hearing for very limited issues 
which, as you all know, there's been a motion by Mr. Epstein to 
stay the civil proceedings against him. The one issue I have 
concern about is Mr. Epstein's contention or assertion that by 
defending against the allegations in the civil proceedings, he

may expose himself to an allegation by the United States in the 
non-prosecution agreement that he's violated that agreement and 
therefore would subject himself to potential federal charges. 
I had asked for some briefing on this. I asked the 
United States to present its position to me. And I received 
the Government's written response, which I frankly didn't find 
very helpful. And I still am not sure I understand what the 
Government's position is on it. 
So first let me hear from Mr. Epstein's attorneys as 
to what do you believe the concern is. I don't believe the 
non-prosecution agreement has ever been filed in this Court; am 
I correct? 
MR. CRITTON: To my knowledge, Your Honor, it has not. 
THE COURT: So I don't believe I've ever seen the 
entire agreement. I've seen portions of it. 
MR. EDWARDS: Your Honor, I believe that it was filed 
under Jane Doe 1 and 2 vs. United States of America, case under 
seal in your court. 
THE COURT: Okay. 
MR. EDWARDS: In a separate case. 
THE COURT: In that case, okay. Was it actually filed 
in that case? 
MR. EDWARDS: I filed it under seal. 
THE COURT: In any event, what's Mr. Epstein's concern 
about if you defend the civil actions, you're going to expose

yourself to a claim for a breach by the United States of the 
non-prosecution agreement? 
MR. CRITTON: Robert Critton. 
Your Honor, our position on this case is, I'd say is 
somewhat different. When this issue originally came before the 
Court, as you are aware prior to my firm's involvement in the 
case, there was a motion filed on behalf of Mr. Epstein seeking 
a stay. And I think it was in Jane Doe 102 and then 
subsequently Jane Doe 2 through 5 because all of those cases 
were filed on or about the same time. 
And at that time the Court looked at the issue and it 
was based upon a statutory provision at that time. And the 
Court said I don't find that it's applicable, or for whatever 
reason I think the Court said I don't consider that to be a 
pending proceeding or a proceeding at that particular time. 
In that same order, which was in Jane Doe 2, I 
believe it's -- not I believe, I know it's docket entry 33, the 
Court also went on to talk about at that particular point in 
time dealt with the issue of the discretionary stay. 
And the Court said at that time, I'm paraphrasing, but 
the Court also does not believe a discretionary stay is 
warranted. And what the Court went on to say is that if 
defendant does not breach the agreement, then he should have no 
concerns regarding his Fifth Amendment right against 
self-incrimination.

The fact that the U.S. Attorney or other law 
enforcement officials may object to some discovery in these 
civil cases is not in and of itself a reason to stay the civil 
litigation, so that any such issue shall be resolved as they 
arise in the course of the litigation. 
And I would respectfully submit to the Court that the 
position that the Government has taken in its most recent 
filings changes the playing field dramatically. Because what 
the Government in essence has said as distinct from the U.S. 
saying is, well, we object to some discovery, or we may object 
to some discovery in the civil cases. 
What they have, in essence, said is if you take some 
action, Mr. Epstein, that we believe unilaterally, and this is 
on pages 13 and 14 of their pleading or of their response memo 
to the Court's inquiry, they say if Mr. Epstein breaches the 
agreement. They said it's basically like a contract, and if 
one side breaches, the other side can sue. 
In this instance what the Government will do is if we 
believe that Mr. Epstein has breached the agreement, we'll 
indict him. We will indict him. And his remedy under that 
circumstance, which is an incredible and catastrophic catch 22 
is, we'll indict him and then he can move to dismiss. That's a 
great option. 
In this particular instance my mandate in defending --
and that's a dramatic change in the Government's position, 
TOTAL ACCESS COURTROOM NETWORK REALTIME TRANSCRIPTION 
EFTA00014198
--- PAGE 8 ---
Case 9:08-cv 80119-KAM 
Document 180 
Entered on FLSD Docket 06/24/2009 
Page 8 of 51 
because the Government is not saying, and the Court was pretty 
specific in what you asked the Government for in its response 
is, in essence, and it's the same question in a more limited 
fashion you're posing today is whether Mr. Epstein's defense of 
the civil action violates the NPA agreement, the 
non-prosecution agreement, between the U.S. and Mr. Epstein. 
And the Government refuses to answer that question. 
They won't come out and say, yes, it will, or no, it won't. 
What they're doing is they want to sit on the sideline, and as 
their papers suggest is, they want us to lay in wait and that 
if, in fact, they believe he violates a provision of the NPA as 
it relates to the defense of this case or these multitude of 
cases, then they can come in and indict him -- no notice, no 
opportunity to cure. 
We don't think that's what the NPA says, but that's 
certainly what their papers say. We'll indict him, no notice, 
no opportunity to cure. We will indict him, and his remedy 
under that circumstance is that he can move to dismiss the 
indictment. 
Well, that's great except Mr. Epstein, his mandate to 
me and I know his mandate to his criminal lawyers, is: Make 
certain I don't do anything, in particular in these civil cases 
that would in any way suggest that I am in willful violation of 
the NPA. 
Now, in the Court's prior ruling in the docket entry 
TOTAL ACCESS COURTROOM NETWORK REALTIME TRANSCRIPTION 
EFTA00014199
--- PAGE 9 ---
Case 9:08-cv 80119-KAM 
Document 180 
Entered on FLSD Docket 06/24/2009 
Page 9 of 51 
33, certainly some aspects of the NPA are within Mr. Epstein's 
control. There's no question about that. But aspects that 
relate to the defense of these cases, either in terms of the 
civil lawyers who are defending these, I think there's 12 or 13 
pending cases in front of you, there's another four cases in 
the state court, is the risk is substantial, it's real, and it 
presents a chilling effect for the civil lawyers in moving 
forward to determine whether or not we're taking some action 
that in some way may be a violation of the NPA. 
And the Government's, again, refusal or non-position 
with regard to past acts that have been taken in the civil case 
with regard to the defense or future acts that we may take with 
regard to these contested litigation casts an extraordinary 
cloud of doubt and uncertainty and fear that the defense of 
these cases could jeopardize Mr. Epstein and put him in the 
irreparable position of violating the NPA and then subsequently 
being indicted. 
In this particular instance, again, Mr. Epstein has no 
intention of willfully violating the NPA, but it's of great 
concern to him. And I'd say with the position that the 
Government has taken, no notice, no cure period, no opportunity 
to discuss. Again, we think that's not what the NPA provides, 
it's not what the deal was between the two contracting parties, 
the United States and Mr. Epstein. But that's clearly what 
their papers say under the circumstances, and it would create

Case 9:08-cv-80119-KAM 
Document 180 
Entered on FLSD Docket 06;24:2009 
Page 10 of 51 10
this irreparable harm to Mr. Epstein under the circumstances. 
In essence, we're left with a catch 22 in defending 
the civil cases. We have a mandate to take no action, to take 
any action which may be deemed to be a violation of the NPA, 
either in the past or in the future, which would in any way 
risk Mr. Epstein being indicted by the United States. 
He has the clear risk of an indictment based upon the 
papers that the Government filed. It's real, it's not remote, 
and it's not speculative. It chills the action of the defense 
in this instance of both Mr. Epstein and his attorneys in 
trying to defend these cases and decide under the circumstances 
can we do this, can we take this position with regard to 
depositions, can we take this legal position with regard to 
motions to dismiss, with regard to responses, with regard to 
replies? 
And we send out paper discovery. Is this in some way 
if we contact someone who may be an associate of these 
individuals as part of our investigation, is that potentially 
in any way a violation of the NPA? Again, we don't think so. 
And, obviously, again, my direction has been from my 
client: Don't take any action that would result in me being 
indicted under the NPA. Well, that's great. But, generally, 
civil lawyers or civil lawyers in defending a personal injury 
case or a tort case, which is exactly what these are, and from 
a practical standpoint, we use various tools to do discovery.

They're standard. They're specific. They're very temporary. 
Very typical. 
But in this instance, as the Court knows, things are 
not typical with regard to this case in any way, shape or form. 
We can't even serve subpoenaes, there's objections and there's 
-- we can't even serve objections to third parties so we can 
obtain documents unless we have to filter it through the 
plaintiffs' attorneys. They won't allow us to use their 
clients' names, even in a subpoena that would never be filed in 
the court. 
How do we do a deposition of a third party? We wanted 
to take the deposition of Jane Doe 4. Well, who is she? Well, 
we can't tell you that. Well, who's the defendant? Well, we 
can't tell you that because nobody wants anybody to know 
anything about the case. They want to present it strictly 
through rose-colored glasses. 
And in this particular instance, we simply can't 
defend this case or take certain action with the spector 
hanging over us that, in fact, the Government may deem it to be 
a violation of the NPA, because very clearly in their response 
papers, they don't say. They say we don't take the position, 
and then they take a substantial position is we think there's 
not all that substantial factors that would entitle him to a 
stay. 
Except for the one major issue which the Court posed

EFTA00014202

Case 9:08-cv-80119-KAM 
Document 180 
Entered on FLSD Docket 06/24/2009 
Page 12 of 51 12 
in the question is, is can he defend these cases? That's what 
I really want to know. Can he defend these cases and, in 
essence, what he has done in the past or what his defense team 
has done in the past and what they're going to do in the 
future, can you give him, Epstein, assurances that the 
Government under this situation, whatever he does, based on 
advice of counsel, that that cannot be a willful violation of 
the NPA, which they can -- they, the U.S. -- can then turn 
around and say that's a violation of the agreement and, 
therefore, we're going to go proceed to indict you under the 
circumstances. 
Our position is, Your Honor, is that the U.S. has now 
cavalierly suggested that, as they did in picking up on the 
court's docket entry or prior order, is, look, compliance with 
the NPA is solely up to Mr. Epstein. In this type of balance 
of equities, it doesn't speak in favor of a stay. 
Well, that's great. And maybe that was the position 
back in '08, on August 5th of '08, when the issue came up in 
front of the Court with regard to the initial stay. 
But the Government's papers under these circumstances 
suggested a very different set of circumstances. Their own 
unilateral, which is the issue that we argued in the motion for 
stay, is that the Government's position is that we can 
unilaterally indict this man if we think he's breached the NPA. 
We don't think that's right, but we have no buffer

between us and the Government. They'll say, and as the Court 
knows, the Government has substantial power. The Government 
does what it wants. Most of the time hopefully they're right. 
Sometimes they make mistakes. 
But in this particular instance, my client has rights. 
We think that there's notice provisions, we think there's cure 
provisions under the NPA. That's not what their paper says 
under the circumstances. 
And what we'd like to know from the Government, and 
maybe the answer is basically what the Court asks is, let the 
Government come forward today and say, based on the knowledge 
that we have, or as of today's date, June 12th, 2009, we, the 
Government, agree that there is no set of circumstances, not 
that we're not aware of, but as of today's date, there is 
nothing that exists that would be a violation of the NPA. 
THE COURT: Well, that's way beyond what I'm 
interested in. I don't know what Mr. Epstein may have done 
outside the context of defending this case that may constitute 
a violation. And if he has done something outside the context 
of defending this case that's a violation, I don't care. 
That's between the United States and Mr. Epstein. 
I'm only concerned about whether anything he does in 
defending these civil actions is going to be a violation of the 
non-prosecution agreement. If he has done something else, it's 
none of my business, and I don't care, and I'm not going to

even ask the Government to give you an assurance that he hasn't 
done anything that might have violated the agreement up till 
today. I'm only interested in defending these civil actions. 
MR. CRITTON: Then I would respectfully submit to the 
Court that the Government be asked in that limited context, are 
they as of today, whether there were or not, but as of today is 
there anything that has been done or will you take the 
position, the United States, that any position that Mr. Epstein 
has taken with regard to defending these civil cases is in any 
way a violation of the NPA? 
THE COURT: Well, I'm not sure what they're going to 
say, but that might -- that cures the problem up to this point. 
But then we have to deal with what's going to happen from here 
on in. And that's another issue that we have to deal with. 
So I understand your position. 
But has anyone suggested to you on behalf of the 
United States that there is something that you've done in 
defending this case that they believe may or could be construed 
as a violation of the non-prosecution agreement? Has anyone 
pointed to anything that you've done? For example, the fact 
that you've wanted to take their -- I don't know if you've 
noticed depositions or not in this case, but if you've sent 
notice of taking deposition, if you sent requests for 
production of documents, if you sent interrogatories, if you 
issued third party subpoenas? Is anything you've done thus far

Document 180 
Entered on FLSD Docket 06/24/2009 
Page 15 of 51 is 
in the context of this case been brought to your attention as a 
potential violation? 
MR. CRITTON: I have received no notification nor am I 
aware that we've received any notification of any action that 
we have taken today. As I suggested to the Court, I don't know 
when they've done or not. And in their papers they suggested, 
well, we don't know everything that's gone on in the civil 
litigation. 
But from a practical standpoint, it was a number of 
comments that were made in their papers is, we can indict, we 
can see if there's a breach. 
Judge, I may have some --
THE COURT: Before you go on. 
MR. CRITTON: I'm sorry. 
THE COURT: You've focused a great deal on the 
Government's response to my inquiry as supporting your position 
that you're in jeopardy. But you've made the suggestion, even 
before this brief was filed, that defending the case was going 
to potentially result in an assertion or allegation that you 
breached the non-prosecution agreement. 
So what was it that caused you to make that initial 
assertion? Because that's what caught my attention, was not 
this brief that the Government has filed was in response to 
something that you filed initially in your most recent motion 
for a stay which raised the issue.

Page 16 of 51 16 
So what was it that gave you some concern to even 
raise the issue that defending this case is going to constitute 
a breach? 
MR. CRITTON: Because there are other instances where 
counsel other than myself, not in the civil aspects, where 
allegations have been made and letters have been sent by the 
United States suggesting that there's been a violation of the 
NPA. And under those circumstances, some notification was 
provided. 
THE COURT: Did it have anything to do with defending 
the civil actions? 
MR. CRITTON: It did not. 
THE COURT: So then why was that issue raised by you 
in the first instance? 
MR. CRITTON: Because of the prospect that the 
defendant could take, that the U.S. would take the position 
under the circumstances that a position that we took with 
regard to the contested litigation may well impact, that the 
Government may have a very different view of what the 
interpretation of the agreement is. 
And as an example is a number of the parties, and I 
know the Court doesn't want to get into a discussion, the issue 
is, is under 2255 is that from the defendant's perspective the 
deal that was cut on that, it was a very specific deal. It 
dealt with both consensual and contested litigation. It dealt

Case 9:08-cv-80119-KAM 
Document 180

Page 17 of 51 
with a secret list of individuals who we had no idea who was on 
the list, and a commitment that he would under certain 
circumstances be required to pay a minimum amount of damages, 
which our position is under 2255 based upon the statute that 
was in effect at the time, a $50,000 as to anyone who wanted --
who came forward who was on the list and met certain criteria. 
The position that now has been asserted by a number of 
the plaintiffs under the circumstances, and it's been pled, and 
actually a number of the complainants is, is Epstein agreed, 
and they cite to a letter that was sent by Ms. 
from 
the Government, that says he has to plead guilty or he can't 
contest liability. That may be true under very, very limited 
or specific circumstances. 
But what the plaintiffs have done in a number of the 
cases, and these are pending motions, is they've said is, well, 
we think C.M.A. cases is a good example, they've pled 30 
separate counts of 2255 alleged violations. And they're saying 
under the circumstances is, therefore, we have 2255 violations, 
there's 30 of them, so 30 times 150, or should be, or whether 
it's 150, that's the amount of money that we want, so maybe $15 
million, or whatever the number is. 
Some of the other plaintiffs' lawyers have been even 
more creative. They've said is, well, we'll agree that it's 
only one cause of action but that each number of violations; 
that is, if 20 alleged incidents occurred, that we would

Case 9:08-cv-80119-KAM 
Document 180

Page 18 of 51 18 
consider to be, or that we will argue are violations, then we 
can take 20 times the 50, or the 150, depending on which 
statute is applicable. 
So the Government under that set of circumstance could 
say, and, again, this is one of the reasons that we raised it, 
they could say, look, our deal with you was that you couldn't 
contest liability, that you were waiving liability, or your 
ability to contest an enumerated offense under 2255. 
Again, part of the deal was as to an enumerated 
offense. Okay. Well, what's that mean? What did he plead to? 
Well, he really didn't plead to anything, which is another 
issue associated with the 2255. But if the Government comes in 
and says, no, wait a minute, our position was, is that you're 
stuck with 2255 and the language within the NPA. And, 
therefore, whether it's an offense or whether it's multiple 
offenses or violations or each one represents an individual 
cause of action, if the Government takes the position that's 
adverse to what we think the clear reading of the agreement was 
under those circumstances, they could claim a violation. 
And as a result -- and that's one of the reasons we 
put -- that was the most glaring one to us, so we raised that 
issue. And then when the Government's response came with 
regard to, is we can just proceed to indict if we think that 
there's been a breach of the agreement. 
That puts us at substantial risk and chills our

ability to move forward. Thank you, Your Honor. 
THE COURT: Thank you. Who wants to be heard from the 
plaintiffs first? 
Is there any plaintiff's attorney who is contending 
that the defense of these civil actions by Mr. Epstein is going 
to constitute a breach of the non-prosecution agreement? 
MR. JOSEFSBERG: Your Honor, this is Bob Josefsberg. 
May I speak? 
THE COURT: Yes, sir. 
MR. JOSEFSBERG: We're not quite confident that any 
breaches of any agreement, which were third-party 
beneficiaries, should be resolved by you. We're not saying it 
shouldn't. But we have not raised any breach of agreement. We 
think that is between the United States and Mr. Epstein. 
What I find incredulous and disingenuous is that 
Mr. Epstein is saying that he wants a stay because he may be 
forced into taking actions in the defense of this case that 
would violate the agreement. 
And let me make our position clear on that. If he 
wants to move to take depositions, interrogatories, production, 
and they are according to your rulings appropriate, not 
invasive of the privacy of someone, and they are relevant, then 
I don't know how those could in any way be violations of the 
agreement. 
What I find hypocritical is that there are two parts 
TOTAL ACCESS COURTROOM NETWORK REALTIME TRANSCRIPTION 
EFTA00014210
--- PAGE 20 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80119-KAM 
Document 180 
Entered on FLSD Docket 06/242009 
Page 20 of 51 20 
to the agreement that I am a beneficiary of. One of them is 
that he has agreed that on any action brought in the 2255, he 
will admit to liability. 
And I received on May 26 a motion to dismiss, which 
we're prepared to respond to and disagree with, but totally 
contesting liability, saying that the statute doesn't apply 
because the girls are no longer minors and saying, and this is 
the great one, saying that the predicate of the conviction 
under 2255 has not been satisfied. 
Now, the understanding that I have is the agreement 
between the Government and Mr. Epstein was that the Government 
desired to see these victims made whole, and wanted them to be 
in the same position as if Mr. Epstein had been prosecuted and 
pled or convicted. And they would be able to have the 
predicate of that criminal conviction, which just as a matter 
of liability would just be introduced as proof that he's done 
this. 
They, under the agreement, are supposed to admit to 
liability on limited something that's under 2255. He has 
filed, but since there is no conviction, there can be no civil 
suit under 2255, with which we disagree. But it is totally in 
opposite of the NPA. 
The second part is there are many young ladies, and 
this perhaps he can use this to his great advantage, who are 
humiliated about this entire situation. Some of them won't

Case 9:08-cv-80119-KAM 
Document 180

Page 21 of 51 2 
come forward. 
We were appointed by Judge Davis as a Special Master 
to represent these young ladies. And some of them don't even 
want to file suit. They don't even want to be known as Jane 
Doe 103. They don't want any of the risks for these motions 
that are pending. 
And part of the agreement was that if we represented 
them and they settle, Mr. Epstein would pay our fees. And he 
has written us as of yesterday that he is under no obligation 
to pay our fees on settling cases. 
Now, those two matters, I believe, may be breaches. 
But I am not asking this Court at this time to do anything 
about them. Nor am I telling the Government, I'm not running 
to the Government and saying indict him because I want you to 
pressure him to do what he agreed to. 
I'm a third-party beneficiary for that agreement, and 
I may move to enforce certain parts of it. But as far as the 
issue of staying the litigation, that is the exact opposite of 
the intent and the letter of the NPA. The purpose of the NPA 
was so that these 34 young ladies, these victims who have been 
severely traumatized, may move on with their lives. 
And to stay this action would be the exact opposite of 
the purpose of that agreement and would be horrible 
psychologically for all of my clients. 
THE COURT: Mr. Josefsberg, I understand your

EFTA00014212
--- PAGE 22 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80119-KAM 
Document 180

position. And I don't want to argue the merits of whether a 
stay should or should not be granted. 
I'm just trying to understand what the ground rules 
are going to be if I grant a stay or if I deny a stay. And 
I've already denied a stay once. I have to decide this current 
motion, and I just want to know what is going to happen if I 
deny the stay in terms of Mr. Epstein's exposure under the 
non-prosecution agreement. That's my concern. 
So if you're telling me that you're not going to urge 
the United States, on behalf of any of your clients, to take 
the position that he's breached the agreement because he's 
taking depositions, because he's pursuing discovery, because 
he's conducting investigations that anyone in any other type of 
civil litigation might conduct with respect to plaintiffs that 
are pursuing claims against a defendant, that those typical 
types of actions, in your judgment, are not breaches of the 
agreement and that he can go forward and defend the case as any 
other defendant could defend, and you're not going to run to 
the United States and say, hey, he's breaching the agreement by 
taking depositions and he's breaching the agreement by issuing 
subpoenas to third parties in order to gather information 
necessary to defend, then I don't have a problem. But if he's 
going to be accused of breaching the agreement because he sends 
out a notice of deposition of one of your clients, how is he 
supposed to defend the case?

Page 23 of 51 23 
MR. JOSEFSBERG: Your Honor, you're totally correct. 
He can depose my client. That's not a problem. But the 
problem is that these are not typical clients and this is not a 
typical case. He has written in his pleadings that he wants to 
publish the names of these girls in the newspapers so that 
other people may come forward to discuss their sexual 
activities with these different plaintiffs. That's not your 
typical case. But are rulings that you'll make in this case, 
and they're not part of the NPA. 
As far as my going to the Government is concerned, I 
find it very uncomfortable for me to use the Government to try 
to pursue my financial interest in litigation. And I know that 
Mr. Epstein and his counsel will make much ado about it. So
am not going to be running there. 
However, if they start taking depositions regarding 
liability, I will consider that to be a breach because they're 
supposed to have admitted liability. 
THE COURT: But, again, I don't have the agreement and 
I don't remember reading the agreement. But what I'm being 
told is the part of the agreement that admits liability is only 
as to a 2255 claim, and there are numerous other personal 
injury tort claims other than 2255 claims. 
And there's a limit of damages on the 2255 claim, as I 
understand it, but I presume that all the plaintiffs are going 
to seek more than the limited or capped amount of damages in 
TOTAL ACCESS COURTROOM NETWORK REALTIME TRANSCRIPTION 
EFTA00014214
--- PAGE 24 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80119-KAM 
Document 180 
Entered on FLSD Docket 06,24/2009 
Page 24 of 51 2 
the non-prosecution agreement as to the other claims. 
And so why aren't they entitled to defend and limit 
the amount of damages that your client is seeking on the 
non-2255 tort claims? 
MR. JOSEFSBERG: Your Honor, you are correct. On 
non-2255 tort claims, they are permitted to do the defense, 
whatever is appropriate. 
My cases are pure 2255 on which liability under the 
agreement is supposed to be admitted. Now, as to the amount of 
damages, there are legal issues that will be before you and 
under the C.M.A. cases that are getting before you, as to 
whether it is 50 or 150. That has nothing to do with the NPA. 
There are legal issues that are before you as to 
whether it is per statute, per count or per incident or per 
plaintiff. Those have nothing to do with the NPA. There is no 
amount in NPA. Those will be resolved. 
Anyone who has brought a case that is outside of 2255, 
the defense is permitted to contest liability under the NPA. 
That's no violation. 
Under the NPA if someone brought a case under just 
2255, Mr. Epstein, if he is to keep his word, cannot contest 
liability. And there would no need to stay this. Because it 
is a self-fulfilling agreement. He can contest liability. A:R1 
as far as the amount of damages, anyone that wants to go over 
the statutory minimums, of course, he can contest that in any 
TOTAL ACCESS COURTROOM NETWORK REALTIME TRANSCRIPTION 
EFTA00014215
--- PAGE 25 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80119-KAM 
Document 180 
Entered on FLSD Docket 06 24 2009 
Page 25 of 51 25 
way that is proper under the Rules of Evidence and your 
rulings. The NPA has no limitation on his contesting damages 
above the minimum statutory amount. 
The only thing that he has done is in his actions of 
refusing to pay for settling defendants, and in his saying that 
he has no liability under 2255, those appear to be contrary to 
what's in the NPA. 
But I'm not in any position right now to claim a 
breach, and I don't know whether I'd be claiming a breach or 
enforcing it in front of you, suing him for fees, asking you to 
have him admit liability, or complaining to the Government. 
And that's why I'm not that helpful in this situation because I 
think it's the Government's role. 
But I do not waive the right to be a third-party 
beneficiary because pursuant to my appointment, which was 
agreed to by Mr. Epstein, I and my clients have certain rights, 
and we want to enforce them. 
But his defending this lawsuit will not in any way be 
a violation. His getting this lawsuit stayed would be a 
violation of the spirit of taking care of these girls, and 
there would be other issues. Like if there is a stay, Your 
Honor, would he be posting a bond? 
THE COURT: We don't need to talk about those issues. 
That's not my concern. 
MR. JOSEFSBERG: I agree, Your Honor, we don't.

THE COURT: That's not my concern. So, again, I just 
want to make sure that if the cases go forward and if 
Mr. Epstein defends the case as someone ordinarily would defend 
a case that's being prosecuted against him or her, that that in 
and of itself is not going to cause him to be subject to 
criminal prosecution. 
MR. JOSEFSBERG: I agree, Your Honor. 
THE COURT: Any other plaintiff's counsel want to 
chime in? 
MR. WILLITS: Richard Willits on behalf of C.M.A.. 
would join, to weigh in on what Mr. Josefsberg said. 
MR. JOSEFSBERG: Your Honor, I could not hear. 
THE COURT: We'll get him to a microphone. 
Mr. Willits is speaking. 
MR. WILLITS: On behalf of my client, C.M.A., we join 
in what Mr. Josefsberg said, and we also want to point out 
something to the Court. 
First, we want to make a representation to the Court, 
we have no intention of complaining to the U.S. Attorney's 
Office, never had that intention, don't have that intention in 
the future, but, of course, subject to what occurs in the 
future. 
I want to point out to the Court that Mr. Epstein went 
into this situation with his eyes wide open, represented by 
counsel, knowing that civil suits had to be coming. If he

didn't know it, his lawyers knew it. 
He appears to be having second thoughts now about he 
could have negotiated this way or he could have negotiated that 
way with the U.S. Attorney's Office. And they want to impose 
their second thoughts on the innocent plaintiffs. We don't 
think that's fair. We think it's in the nature of invited 
error, if there was any error whatsoever. 
Thank you. 
THE COURT: You agree he should be able to take the 
ordinary steps that a defendant in a civil action can take and 
not be concerned about having to be prosecuted? 
MR. WILLITS: Of course. And we say the same thing 
Mr. Josefsberg said. It's all subject to your rulings and the 
direction of this Court as to what is proper and what is not 
proper. And we're prepared to abide by the rulings of this 
Court, and we have no intention of running to the State's 
Attorney. 
THE COURT: The U.S. Attorney? 
MR. WILLITS: I'm sorry. The U.S. Attorney. 
THE COURT: Mr. Garcia. 
MR. GARCIA: Thank you, Your Honor. 
If I may briefly, I think perhaps defense counsel 
forgot about this, but on pages 17 and 19 of my memorandum of 
law in opposition to the motion to dismiss, I did make 
reference to the non-prosecution agreement, and I did say that 
TOTAL ACCESS COURTROOM NETWORK REALTIME TRANSCRIPTION 
EFTA00014218
--- PAGE 28 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80119-KAM 
Document 180 
Entered on FLSD Docket 06/24/2009 
Page 28 of 51 28 
the contesting of the jurisdiction of this Court was a 
potential breach of the non-prosecution agreement. 
So my client happens to have, and they have filed with 
the Court a copy of her state court complaint, given the fact 
that the non-prosecution agreement limits the non-contesting of 
jurisdiction to claims exclusively brought under the federal 
statute. 
I'm going to go ahead and withdraw those contentions 
on pages 17 and 19 of my memo of law because it doesn't apply 
to my case. So to the extent that I raised this issue with 
defense counsel and the Court, I'm going to withdraw that 
aspect of it. 
THE COURT: Can you file something in writing on that 
point with the Court? 
MR. GARCIA: Yes. 
THE COURT: What do you say about this issue that 
we're here on today? 
MR. GARCIA: I think that the problem that I have with 
it is that this non-prosecution agreement is being used by 
defense counsel for the exact opposite purpose that it was 
intended. My perception of this thing, and I wasn't around, is 
that Mr. Epstein essentially bought his way out of a criminal 
prosecution, which is wonderful for the victims in a way, and 
wonderful for him, too. 
Now he's trying to use the non-prosecution agreement 
TOTAL ACCESS COURTROOM NETWORK REALTIME TRANSCRIPTION 
EFTA00014219
--- PAGE 29 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80119-KAM 
Document 180

Page 29 of 51 29 
as a shield against the plaintiffs that he was supposed to make 
restitution for. 
And, certainly, he can take my client's depo. He's 
done extensive discovery in the state court case -- very 
intrusive, I might add. And we don't care, because we can win 
this case with the prosecution agreement or without the 
prosecution agreement. We are ready to go forward. 
THE COURT: You're not going to assert to the United 
States Government that what he's doing in defending the case is 
a violation for which he should be further prosecuted? 
MR. GARCIA: Absolutely not. 
THE COURT: Anyone else for the plaintiffs? 
MR. HOROWITZ: Judge, Adam Horowitz, counsel for 
plaintiffs Jane Doe 2 through 7. 
I just wanted to address a point that I think you've 
articulated it. I just want to make sure it's crystal clear, 
which is that we can't paint a broad brush for all of the 
cases. 
The provision relating to Mr. Epstein being unable to 
contest liability pertains only to those plaintiffs who have 
chosen as their sole remedy the federal statute. My clients, 
Jane Doe 2 through 7, have elected to bring additional causes 
of action, and it's for that reason we were silent when you 
said does anyone here find Mr. Epstein to be in breach of the 
non-prosecution agreement. That provision, as we understand

it, it doesn't relate to our clients. 
THE COURT: Okay. But, again, you're in agreement 
with everyone else so far that's spoken on behalf of a 
plaintiff that defending the case in the normal course of 
conducting discovery and filing motions would not be a breach? 
MR. HOROWITZ: Subject to your rulings, of course, 
yes. 
THE COURT: Thank you. 
Anyone else have anything to say from the plaintiffs? 
Ms. 
, if you would be so kind as to maybe 
help us out. I appreciate the fact that you're here, and I 
know you're not a party to these cases and under no obligation 
to respond to my inquiries. But as I indicated, it would be 
helpful for me to understand the Government's position. 
MS. 
: Thank you, Your Honor. And we, of 
course, are always happy to try to help the Court as much as 
possible. But we are not a party to any of these lawsuits, and 
in some ways we are at a disadvantage because we don't have 
access. My access is limited to what's on Pacer. So I don't 
really know what positions Mr. Epstein may have taken either in 
correspondence or in discovery responses that aren't filed in 
the case file. 
But your first order was really just what do you think 
about a stay, and then the second order related to this hearing 
and asked a much more specific question, which is whether we

believe that Mr. Epstein's defense was a breach of the 
agreement. 
And I've tried to review as many of the pleadings as 
possible. As you know, they're extremely voluminous. And I 
haven't been through all of them. But we do believe that there 
has been a breach in the filing that Mr. Josefsberg referred 
to, and contrary to Mr. Critton, we do understand that we have 
an obligation to provide notice, and we are providing notice to 
Mr. Epstein today. 
The pleading that we found to be in breach -- the 
non-prosecution agreement, sought to do one thing, which was to 
place the victims in the same position they would have been if 
Mr. Epstein had been convicted of the federal offenses for 
which he was investigated. 
And that if he had been federally prosecuted and 
convicted, the victims would have been entitled to restitution, 
regardless of how long ago the crimes were committed, 
regardless of how old they were at the time, and how old they 
are today, or at the time of the conviction. 
And it also would have made them eligible for damages 
under 2255. 
And so our idea was, our hope was that we could set up 
a system that would allow these victims to get that restitution 
without having to go through what civil litigation will expose 
them to.

You have a number of girls who were very hesitant 
about even speaking to authorities about this because of the 
trauma that they have suffered and about the embarrassment that 
they were afraid would be brought upon themselves and upon 
their families. 
So we did through the non-prosecution agreement tried 
to protect their rights while also protecting their privacy. 
So, pursuant to the non-prosecution agreement -- on the other 
hand, we weren't trying to hand them a jackpot or a key to a 
bank. It was solely to sort of put them in that same position. 
So we developed this language that said if -- that 
provided for an attorney to represent them. Most of the 
victims, as you know from the pleadings, come from not wealthy 
circumstances, may not have known any attorneys who would be in 
a position to help them. 
So we went through the Special Master procedure that 
resulted in the appointment of Mr. Josefsberg, and the goal was 
that they would be able to try to negotiate with Mr. Epstein 
for a fair amount of restitution/damages. And if Mr. Epstein 
took the position, which apparently he has, which is that the 
$50,000 or $150,000 floor under 2255 also would be a cap. Tn-t. 
if they were to proceed to file suit in Federal Court to get 
fair damages under 2255, Mr. Epstein would admit liability, but 
he, of course, could fight the damages portion, which means 
that, of course, he would be entitled to depositions; of

Page 33 of 51 33 
course, he would be entitled to take discovery, and we don't 
believe that any of that violates the non-prosecution 
agreement. 
The issue with the pleading that he filed, the motion 
to dismiss the case, I believe it's Jane Doe 101, represented 
by Mr. Josefsberg, is that that is a case that was filed 
exclusively under 18 U.S.C., Section 2255. She met that 
requirement. Mr. Epstein is moving to dismiss it, not on the 
basis of damages, he is saying that he cannot be held liable 
under 2255 because he was not convicted of an offense. 
The reason why he was not convicted of an offense is 
because he entered into the non-prosecution agreement. So that 
we do believe is a breach. 
The issue really that was raised in the motion to stay 
and that I addressed in our response to the motion to stay is 
that Mr. Epstein's -- Mr. Epstein wants to stay the litigation 
in order to leave, in order to sort of attack the cases of the 
victims whether they are fully within the non-prosecution or 
not, non-prosecution agreement or not, and leave the Government 
without a remedy if he does, in fact, breach those terms. And 
that is why we opposed the stay. 
THE COURT: I'm not sure what you mean by that last 
statement. 
MS. 
: Well, because this issue related to 
the motion to dismiss on Mr. Josefsberg's client came up after

we had filed that response. And what we said in the response 
to the motion to stay is that the reason why he wants to stay 
the litigation is so that the non-prosecution agreement 
terminates based on a period of time, as he puts it. And then 
afterwards he would be able to come in here and make all of 
these arguments that clearly violate the non-prosecution 
agreement but we would be without remedy. 
THE COURT: But you're not taking the position that 
other than possibly doing something in litigation which is a 
violation of an express provision of the non-prosecution 
agreement, any other discovery, motion practice, investigations 
that someone would ordinarily do in the course of defending a 
civil case would constitute a violation of the agreement? 
MS. 
: No, Your Honor. I mean, civil 
litigation is civil litigation, and being able to take 
discovery is part of what civil litigation is about. And while 
there may be, for example, if someone were to try to subpoena 
the Government, we would obviously resist under statutory 
reasons, all that sort of stuff. But, no, Mr. Epstein is 
entitled to take the deposition of a plaintiff and to subpoena 
records, etc. 
THE COURT: And even if he seeks discovery from a 
Government agency, you have the right to resist it under the 
rules of procedure but that would not constitute a violation, 
again unless there's a provision in the prosecution agreement

that says I can't do this? 
MS. 
: 
Correct. 
THE COURT: That's your position? 
MS. 
: 
Yes. 
THE COURT: Thank you. 
MS. 
: 
Thank you, Your Honor. 
THE COURT: Mr. Critton, did you want to add anything? 
MR. CRITTON: Yes, sir. Just a few responses to some 
of the issues that have been raised. 
The most glaring, at least from our perspective, is 
both Mr. Josefsberg's comments that he believes that there's -t 
violation of the NPA as well as Ms. 
with regard to 
Jane Doe 101. 
Mr. Josefsberg, while he was the attorney rep who was 
selected by Judge Davis to represent a number of individuals, 
alleged victims that may have been on the list, he represents 
many of them. And the type of response that was filed in 101 
would probably be very similar to what we will file if he 
files -- and he filed 102 as well. But if he files 103, 104 
and 105, or whatever number he files, we may well take that 
same legal position in our motions and in our response or in 
reply. 
And what we've been, in essence, told today is we 
consider that to be a violation of the NPA under the 
circumstances.

Document 180

Page 36 of 51 36 
102 is a perfect example that he filed is, we have 
e-mails going back and forth between the Government and my 
clients' attorneys at the time that suggested that 102 probably 
doesn't even fit within the statute of limitations. 
So under Mr. Josefsberg's argument is as well, we've 
only brought a 2255 claim. We don't care whether she's within 
or is outside the statute of limitations. Because she was on 
the list and under the circumstances, he has to admit 
liability, which we contest is under that set of circumstances 
you're stuck with it. You can fight damages if you can, but 
she's a real person and you can't raise statute of limitations. 
The other point that kind of strikes out is there's 
probably a difference. And I'm happy to provide a copy of the 
NPA or a redacted portion of the NPA which deals with the civil 
issues, which are paragraphs 7, 8, 9 and 10, and the entire 
addenda in camera for the Court to look at, if plaintiff's 
counsel and the Government, I guess, really, because they're 
not a party, is if they have no objection because they all have 
access based on a prior court order to the non-prosecution 
agreement. 
So I'm happy to provide that to the Court today and 
show it to counsel so that the Court can review that. 
But our position with regard to the 2255 claims is 
that -- there were two types of claims that could be filed, one 
was consensual litigation, the second was contested litigation.

Document 180

Page 37 of 51 37 
And under the consensual, in essence, which Mr. Epstein did, is 
he's offered $50,000 of the statutory minimum for that time 
period to all of those individuals. 
THE COURT: Can I interrupt you a second? 
MR. CRITTON: Yes, sir. 
THE COURT: I'm not here, and I don't believe it's my 
role to decide whether or not there is or is not a breach of 
the agreement. I'm just trying to understand what the 
Government's position is regarding your defending these cases. 
Now, I'm just saying this as an example. If, for 
example, in the non-prosecution agreement there was a provision 
that said explicitly: Jeffrey Epstein shall not move to 
dismiss any claim brought under 2255 by any victim no matter 
how long ago the allegations or the acts took place, period. 
If that was in the agreement and you filed a motion to 
dismiss by someone who brought a claim, it might sound like it 
might be a violation. 
MR. CRITTON: I agree. 
THE COURT: So you would know that when you filed your 
motion because it was right there for you to read. 
And so to stay the case because I want to do something 
that the contract expressly prohibits me from doing, so stay 
the case until the agreement expires so then I can do something 
that the agreement said I couldn't do so you won't be in fear 
of prosecuting, I'm not sure that that is what I'm concerned

about. 
I'm concerned about discovery, investigation, motion 
practice, that's not prohibited by a provision of the 
agreement. If there's something that's prohibited by the 
agreement that you, knowing what the agreement says, go ahead 
and do, anyway, I guess that's a risk you're going to have to 
take. If there's a legitimate dispute about it, I guess some 
arbiter is going to decide whether it's a breach or not. 
But, again, that's something you and Mr. Burman, 
Mr. Goldberger, and you are all very good lawyers, and he's got 
a whole list of lawyers representing him, and you've got the 
agreement and you're going to make legal decisions on how to 
proceed, and you're going to have to go and make your own 
decisions. 
I'm concerned about things that aren't in the 
agreement, that aren't covered, that you're going to be accused 
of violating because, again, you take depositions, you send out 
subpoenas, you file motions that are not prohibited by the 
agreement. And that's what I'm concerned about. 
MR. CRITTON: And I understand that, Your Honor. 
But at the same time, it's as if the lawyers and the 
clients, based upon our interpretation of the agreement, and, 
believe me, we would not have filed 101, the motion to dismiss, 
but for believing that there was a good faith basis to do that 
under the circumstances.

Page 39 of 51 39 
And now, in essence, we're being accused not only by 
-- not accused, but it's been suggested that there's a breach 
of the NPA, not only by Mr. Josefsberg on behalf of 101, but as 
well Ms. 
on behalf of the United States. 
That's the perfect example. They're basically saying 
we think you violated. We may send you notice under the 
circumstances. So does that mean that on 101 we have to back 
off of it because we think in good faith that it's a motion and 
is that something that this Court ultimately will rule? 
THE COURT: I don't know that I'm the one who is going 
to make that decision. Again, that's not the kind of thing 
that I was concerned about. I was more concerned about the 
normal, ordinary course of conducting and defending a case that 
would not otherwise expressly be covered under the agreement, 
that you're going to then have someone say, ah, he's sent a 
notice of deposition, he's harassing the plaintiffs. I don't 
know if there's a no contact provision in the agreement or no 
harassment type of provision in the agreement. Ah, this is a 
breach because you sent discovery, or he's issuing subpoenas to 
third parties trying to find out about these victims' 
backgrounds, he's breaching the agreement. 
Those are the kind of things that I was worried about. 
MR. CRITTON: The concern that we have is as part of 
doing this general civil litigation, it's not just the 
discovery process. And I understand the issues that the Court

EFTA00014230

Case 9:08-cv-80119-KAM 
Document 180

Page 40 of 51 40 
has raised. 
But part of it is that often cases are disposed of 
either on a summary basis or certainly legal issues that come 
before the Court during the course of the case, just like in a 
criminal case. That's clearly part of the, I'd say the defense 
of the case under the circumstances; and if, in fact, an 
individual can't legally bring a cause of action for certain 
reasons, such as has been suggested in 101, and may be 
suggested in 102 when that pleading is filed, that certainly is 
a position that puts my client at risk. 
As another example that I use with C.M.A., that they 
filed this 30-count complaint. Now, they have the state court 
claims as well. But they, in essence, have said they filed 
another pleading with the Court that says depending on what the 
Court rules, in essence, on whether we can file multiple claims 
or one cause of action with multiple violations, we may dump 
the state court claims and, therefore, we'll just ride along on 
that. That's a very different --
Mr. Epstein would never have entered into, nor would 
his attorneys have allowed him to enter into that agreement 
under those circumstances where he had this unlimited 
liability. That clearly was never envisioned by any of the 
defendants -- by the defendant or any of his lawyers under the 
circumstances. 
And if that's claimed to be a violation, either by the

attorneys; i.e., he's not recapitulating on liability under the 
2255, and that's all we have now. That's our exclusive remedy. 
And the Government says, yeah, that's right, that's a 
violation of the NPA. It again chills us from moving forward, 
filing the necessary motion papers and taking legal positions 
that may put my client at risk for violating the NPA and then 
creating the irreparable harm of, after having been in jail, 
after having pled guilty to the state court counts, after 
registering on release as a sex offender, he's complied and 
done everything, taken extraordinary efforts to comply with the 
NPA, puts him at substantial risk. And that's what our worry 
is moving forward. 
MR. JOSEFSBERG: Your Honor, may I be heard. May I 
make three comments? It will take less than a minute. 
THE COURT: Yes, sir. 
MR. JOSEFSBERG: Mr. Critton refers to the alleged 
victims. I want you to know that our position is that pursuant 
to the NPA they're not alleged victims. They are actual, real 
victims, admitted victims. 
Secondly, he argues about the statute of limitations 
on 102. I know that you don't want to hear about that, and I'm 
not going to comment about it. But please don't take our lack 
of argument about this as being we agree with anything. 
Last and most important, we totally agree with 
Mr. Critton in his suggestion that he hand you a copy of the

NPA. I think that many of the questions you asked will be 
answered when you read the NPA, and I think it's very unfair of 
everyone who is sitting in front of you who have the NPA to be 
discussing with you whether it's being breached, whether there 
should be a stay when you're not that familiar with it. 
If we would give you a copy of it, I think it would be 
much more helpful in making your ruling. 
THE COURT: Maybe Judge Colvat will resolve this issue 
for me. 
MR. JOSEFSBERG: Even if he doesn't, Your Honor, I 
believe we are allowed to show it to you. 
THE COURT: I'll tell you what: I'll wait for Judge 
Colvat to rule, and then if he rules that it should remain 
sealed, then I'll consider whether or not I want to have it 
submitted to me in camera. 
Anything else, Mr. Josefsberg? 
MR. JOSEFSBERG: No. I thank you on behalf of myself 
and the other counsel on the phone for permitting us to appear 
by phone. 
THE COURT: All right. Anyone else have anything they 
want to add? 
MR. EDWARDS: Brad Edwards on behalf of Jane Doe. 
I only had one issue here, and when I read your motion 
that you wanted to hear on the narrow issue of just defense in 
the civil actions filed against him violates the

non-prosecution agreement, I was expecting that we were going 
to hear something from the Government similar to the affidavit 
that was filed by Mr. Epstein's attorneys wherein he indicates 
as of the day of this affidavit attached to the motion to stay, 
the U.S. Attorney's Office has taken the position that Epstein 
has breached the non-prosecution agreement and it names 
specifically investigation by Epstein of this plaintiff and 
other plaintiffs, Epstein's contesting damages in this action. 
Epstein, or his legal representatives, making statements to the 
press. And we didn't hear any of those things. 
So that's what I was expecting that the U.S. 
Attorney's Office was going to expound on and say, yes, we've 
made some communications to Epstein. He's violating. 
What we're hearing right now, today, just so that I'm 
clear, and I think the Court is clear now, is that the 
non-prosecution agreement is what it is. There have been no 
violations, but for maybe what Mr. Josefsberg brought up. 
But there are very few restrictions on Mr. Epstein. 
He went into this eyes wide open. And whether or not I agree 
with the agreement, how it came to be in the first place, is 
neither here nor there. 
But there have been no violations or breaches up to 
this point. And his affidavit that was filed, I'm just 
troubled by where it even came from. I mean, it's making 
specific allegations that the U.S. Attorney's Office is

threatening a breach, and this is part of the motion to stay, 
which we're all battling here. 
So I just wanted to indicate to the Court or remind 
the Court that there have been specific allegations made, the 
United States Attorney's Office is making these allegations of 
breach, which we haven't heard any of the evidence of. 
Thank you. 
THE COURT: All right. 
Ms. 
, did you want to respond to that 
suggestion that there were other allegations of breach besides 
the one that you've just mentioned today? 
MS. 
: 
No, Your Honor. 
THE COURT: Thank you. I appreciate your giving me 
the information, which I think has been very helpful today, and 
I'll try and get an order out as soon as possible.

Prince Andrew 'shut the door' on Epstein probe cooperation: U.S. prosecutor 
Reuters 
By Brendan Pierson and Mark Hosenball 
3/9/2020 
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Britain's Prince Andrew has declined to cooperate with a U.S. investigation into possible co-
conspirators of deceased financier and accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, a U.S. prosecutor said on Monday. 
"Contrary to Prince Andrew's very public offer to cooperate with our investigation into Epstein's co-conspirators, an 
offer that was conveyed via press release, Prince Andrew has now completely shut the door on voluntary cooperation 
and our office is considering its options," U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman said when asked about Epstein at a news 
conference about an unrelated case. 
Berman's spokesman James Margolin declined comment on the options being considered. He said the prince's lawyers 
had said Andrew would not submit voluntarily to an interview. He said this was after Jan. 27, when Berman told a news 
conference Andrew had not offered any cooperation. 
Andrew, 60, had said in a public statement in November that he was stepping down from public duties and would be 
willing to help "any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required." 
A friend of Epstein's, the prince has not been accused of criminal wrongdoing. He has described his association with the 
financier as "ill-judged." A spokeswoman for the royal family declined comment. 
Clare Montgomery, a senior London barrister who British news reports say represents Andrew on matters related to 
Epstein, also declined to comment, citing professional rules limiting her ability to speak publicly about legal issues. 
Andrew, Queen Elizabeth's second son, has denied an accusation by a woman who said she was trafficked by Epstein 
and forced to have sex with his friends, including the prince, when she was 17. 
A U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation probe is focusing on British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, a longtime associate of 
Epstein's, and others who facilitated the wealthy financier's alleged trafficking of underage girls, law enforcement 
sources told Reuters in December. 
Epstein had socialized with the prince and other high-profile figures including U.S. President Donald Trump and former 
president Bill Clinton. 
Epstein's suicide in Manhattan's Metropolitan Correctional Center in August, at age 66, occurred little over a month 
after he was arrested and charged with trafficking dozens of underage girls as young as 14 from at least 2002 to 2005. 
Prosecutors said he recruited girls to give him massages, which became sexual in nature. Epstein had pleaded not guilty.

Jail captain in charge when Jeffrey Epstein hanged himself to be transferred: sources 
NY Daily News 
By Stephen Rex Brown 
3/9/2020 
He's certainly no stranger to emergencies. 
The Metropolitan Correctional Center captain in charge when Jeffrey Epstein hanged himself is expected to be 
transferred to a new lockup where he will serve as "emergency preparedness officer," sources tell the Daily News. 
Jermaine Darden's move to FCI Fort Dix, a low-security prison in Burlington County, N.J., was delayed due to the ongoing 
lockdown at the dysfunctional jail in lower Manhattan, according to a source. 
As captain, Darden oversees lieutenants and correctional officers at MCC. Among those under his command were 
Officers Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, who are accused of sleeping on the job and falsifying records the night of 
Epstein's death. 
A source doubted that Darden was at the jail when Epstein was found hanging in his cell at 6:30 a.m. on Aug. 10 but was 
confident he was one of the first people called about it. 
Thomas' attorney Montell Figgins said Darden's transfer and new title was yet another example of the upper ranks of 
the Metropolitan Correctional Center facing no consequences for systemic Bureau of Prisons failures that allowed the 
accused sex trafficker to avoid facing justice. 
"It shows you the hubris of the system," Figgins said. "They couldn't care less about the reality of what they're dong. 
They would take this person, who was involved in this incident, and give him another title?" 
Darden, 48, declined to comment. 
The transfer follows a pattern similar to that of Lamine N'Diaye, the correctional center warden during the Epstein 
debacle. N'Diaye was moved to a desk job at a regional office in Pennsylvania days after the suicide. He was expected to 
assume a leadership role at Fort Dix in February until U.S. Attorney General William Barr intervened and ordered the 
transfer be put on hold while investigations into Epstein's death continue, The Associated Press reported. 
Darden's new title at Fort Dix could come with a pay raise, a source said. 
Working at the low-security lockup in New Jersey should be less stressful than at the Metropolitan Correctional Center. 
The 12-story jail next door to Manhattan Federal Court has been reeling since Epstein's suicide. The building's 
infrastructure is crumbling. Morale is at rock bottom following the arrests of Thomas and Noel. A gun smuggled into the 
jail prompted an ongoing lockdown and forced overworked staff to put in even longer hours. The FBI is investigating the 
flow of contraband into the facility.

The FBI is investigating the flow of contraband into the facility. 
Figgins made the case that Darden's leadership was one of many problems at the Metropolitan Correctional Center at 
the time of Epstein's suicide. 
"They don't have any pictures of what happened that night because they didn't follow proper protocol," Figgins said. 
"And yet he gets another position." 
The Bureau of Prisons declined to comment on personnel decisions. 
Thomas and Noel have pleaded not guilty to charges including filing false records, which carries a maximum sentence of 
five years.

Horse racing trainers and veterinarians charged in international doping scandal 
NBC 
By Tom Winter and David K. Li 
3/9/2020 
More than two dozen trainers, veterinarians and others in horse racing were charged in a widespread doping scheme 
that "amounted to nothing less than abuse," federal officials and court papers revealed Monday. 
The defendants ran horses at tracks in New York, New Jersey, Florida, Ohio, Kentucky and the United Arab Emirates, 
federal prosecutors in New York City said. 
"Over the course of the scheme, participants manufactured, purchased, sold, shipped, delivered, received and 
administered thousands of units" of performance-enhancing drugs, or PEDs, for use on racehorses, U.S. Attorney 
Geoffrey Berman wrote in charging documents against 19 of 27 defendants. 
The indicted included 11 trainers, seven veterinarians and nine drug suppliers and distributors, according to Berman. 
"All involved in the cruel and systematic doping of racehorses across the United States and indeed around the world 
using misbranded, adulated and dangerous performance-enhancing drugs," Berman told reporters in New York. 
"This is the most far-reaching prosecution of racehorse doping in the history of the Department of Justice." 
William F. Sweeney Jr., the FBI's assistant director in charge of the New York office, said this practice forced horses to 
run faster than they really could, putting them in grave danger. 
"These substances stimulated endurance, deadened nerves, increased oxygen intake and reduced inflammation," 
Sweeney told reporters. "What actually happened to these horses amounted to nothing less than abuse." 
He added: "They experienced cardiac issues, overexertion leading to leg fractures, increased risk of injury and in some 
cases death." 
As of now, investigators said they have not found any evidence that defendants told anyone about their doping scheme 
so to make bets on juiced horses. But they allegedly profited on hefty prize money. 
"Conversely, the human beings in the scheme continued to line their purses as they manipulated this multiple-billion-
dollar horse racing industry across the globe," Sweeney said. "People are rightfully disturbed by the mistreatment of 
animals who have absolutely no means of defense." 
Prosecutors said trainer Jorge Navarro "orchestrated" this scheme by "using PEDs designed to evade drug tests, 
physically concealing containers of PEDs and drug paraphernalia from state regulators and racing officials."

One of Navarro's most prized thoroughbreds, X Y Jet, died of an apparent heart attack this year after receiving a 
significant amount of PEDs, in one instance 50 injections, according to the indictment. 
X Y Jet won the prestigious Dubai Golden Shaheen at Meydan Racecourse in Dubai in March 2019, which paid $1.5 
million to the winner, highlighting a career of 12 victories and more than $3 million in earnings. The horse won that race 
and another contest in February of last year in Florida after receiving adulterated and misbranded PEDs before both 
races, according to the indictment. 
While in the UAE for the Dubai race, Navarro "personally administered various adulterated and misbranded PEDs to X Y 
Jet, including a substance Navarro referred to as 'monkey,' " according to the indictment. 
"Monkey" is a commonly used code word for a drug that can "boost a racehorse's red blood cell count in order to 
stimulate endurance during a race and improve race recover," according to the indictment. 
But those drugs, "when combined with intense physical exertion, thicken the horse's blood, thereby causing increased 
cardiac exertion and pressure, which can lead to cardiac issues or death," the indictment said. 
Navarro and another high profile trainer, Jason Servis, were both indicted on a count of conspiracy of drug adulteration 
and misbranding. 
Navarro allegedly told Servis in an intercepted phone call on March 5 last year that he particularly liked a PED called SGF-
1000. 
"I've been using it on everything almost," Navarro told Servis. Navarro ended the phone call a short time later, saying, "I 
don't want to talk about this s--- on the phone, OK," according to prosecutors. 
Servis is the trainer of Maximum Security, who crossed the finish line first at last year's Kentucky Derby but was 
disqualified minutes later after stewards ruled that the horse had impeded the paths of others; Country House was 
declared the winner. Maximum Security won the Eclipse Award as horse racing's top 3-year-old colt in 2019. 
Before a race later that year at Monmouth Park in Oceanport, New Jersey, Servis was caught on an intercepted 
telephone call with veterinarian and co-defendant Kristian Rhein, according to the indictment. The veterinarian assured 
Servis that a PED given to Maximum Security wouldn't show up on a test. 
"They don't even have a test for it," Rhein told Servis, the indictment alleged. "There's no test for it in America." 
Federal agents specializing in organize crime probes were investigating a "different case, on a different topic all 
together" before they tripped on to the doping scheme and "one thing led to another," according to Sweeney. 
"We had one agent in particular (who) was actually an expert in this industry from (a) prior life," Sweeney said. "He was 
part of the team and they did great work." 
The indictments show how widespread illegal drugs are in horse racing, according to People for the Ethical Treatment of 
Animals.

"This sweeping federal investigation has exposed that illegal doping is still ubiquitous in horse racing, including at the 
highest levels," PETA Senior Vice President Kathy Guillermo said in a statement. 
"These crimes cheat bettors of billions of dollars and are egregiously cruel to horses, resulting in rampant injuries, pain, 
and deaths, such as those cited in the indictment."

Maximum Security trainer among 27 indicted in racehorse doping scheme 
NY Post 
By Gabrielle Fonrouge 
3/9/2020 
The trainer behind the world's best racehorse, Maximum Security, along with 26 others have been indicted in the largest 
crackdown on racehorse doping the Department of Justice has ever seen, Manhattan federal prosecutors announced 
Monday. 
Jason Servis, who just led Maximum Security to a $10 million victory in last month's Saudi Cup, allegedly used everything 
from customized painkillers to blood thickeners on "virtually all of the racehorses under his control" to make them 
"unnaturally fast," prosecutors alleged. 
"These defendants engaged in this conduct not for the love of the sport, and certainly not out of concern for the horses, 
but for money," US Attorney for the Southern District of New York Geoffrey Berman said Monday. "And it was the 
racehorses that paid the price for the defendants' unbridled greed." 
Prosecutors alleged the international scheme spanned racetracks in New York, New Jersey, Florida, Ohio, Kentucky and 
the United Arab Emirates and could have killed a number of horses. 
"You know how many [expletive] horses he [Navarro] [expletive] killed and broke down that I made disappear? ... You 
know how much trouble he could get in ... if they found out ... the six horses we killed?" Nicholas Surick, one of the 
indicted trainers, wrote in a text message about co-conspirator Jorge Navarro, another high-profile horse trainer. 
One of Navarro's award-winning steeds, X Y Jet, died of an apparent heart attack in January after receiving over 50 
injections of performance-enhancing drugs, an indictment against Navarro alleges. 
Berman said X Y Jet's death is still under investigation. 
The probe, started two years ago by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, turned up a total of nine trainers, nine 
suppliers and seven crooked veterinarians who used blood thickeners, painkillers and bronchodilators to dope the 
horses. 
"These substances stimulated endurance, deadened nerves, increased oxygen intake and reduced inflammation," 
William Sweeney, assistant director in charge of the FBI's New York office, said at a press conference. 
"What actually happened to these horses amounted to nothing less than abuse." 
Sweeney said the PEDs caused the horses to have "cardiac issues" and led to "overexertion," which can cause leg 
fractures and death. 
One of the indicted veterinarians, Dr. Louis Grasso, who'd previously been investigated for a racehorse doping scheme, 
allegedly distributed "cobra venom" to trainers as a painkiller and filled out prescriptions under the names of canine 
patients to keep investigators off his tail, according to court records and Paulick Report. 
"I don't give a f—k what it is," Grasso allegedly told co-conspirator and fellow racehorse trainer Thomas Guido III when 
saying he charges "$100 per script," according to an indictment against him. 
Grasso then allegedly boasted to an undercover officer that he could get "a script for anything," records show. 
Investigators alleged Grasso submitted false prescriptions to over 10 pharmacies in at least seven states in 2019 alone 
and was caught counseling Guido after one of his horses died, the indictment states.

"It happens ... [the trainer] probably over juiced him," Grasso allegedly said. "I've seen that happen 20 times." 
A total of 26 out of the 27 defendants were arrested Monday while another defendant, Seth Fishman, was previously 
arrested in October. Servis got hit with a charge of misbranding conspiracy, which relates to mislabeling drugs. 
They collectively face a total of 105 years in prison, prosecutors said.

Schulte 
Trial of Programmer Accused in C.I.A. Leak Ends in Hung Jury 
NYT 
By Nicole Hong 
3/9/2020 
An office of the Central Intelligence Agency outside Washington turned into a crime scene on March 7, 2017. 
WikiLeaks had just published a trove of confidential C.I.A. documents that revealed secret methods the spy agency used 
to penetrate the computer networks of foreign governments and terrorists. 
Investigators scrambled to find the culprit, seizing more than 1,000 devices from the C.I.A. as top-secret operations and 
computer networks shut down. Eventually, they arrested Joshua Schulte, 31, who worked as a computer engineer for 
the agency. 
But on Monday, in a muddled outcome for the government, a federal jury in Manhattan could not agree on whether to 
convict Mr. Schulte of the biggest theft of classified documents in C.I.A. history. 
After hearing four weeks of testimony, the jurors deadlocked on eight counts, including illegal gathering and 
transmission of national defense information. They did convict Mr. Schulte on two other counts — contempt of court 
and making false statements to the F.B.I. 
The motivation for the alleged theft, prosecutors said, was Mr. Schulte's belief that C.I.A. management did not take his 
workplace complaints seriously. His feuding with co-workers led to his resignation in November 2016 to join Bloomberg 
L.P. as a software engineer. 
The partial verdict came after six days of chaotic deliberations. One juror was dismissed in the middle of the discussions 
because she violated the judge's orders by researching the case, and then shared that information with the jury. The 
judge declined to replace her with an alternate, leaving a panel of 11 people. 
The jury also complained in a note about a separate juror who was not participating in the group discussion, raising 
concerns about "her attitude." 
After the verdict, one juror said the deliberations were a "horrible experience," her eyes welling with tears as she 
walked away from reporters. 
Mr. Schulte's legal troubles are not over. The government could retry the case. In addition, during the investigation, 
federal agents found more than 10,000 images and videos of child pornography on electronic devices in Mr. Schulte's 
home. He faces a separate federal trial on those charges. 
The verdict showed that the jury had doubts about the government's most important evidence, which came from a 
C.I.A. server. Trial witnesses guided jurors through a complicated maze of forensic analysis that, according to 
prosecutors, showed Mr. Schulte's work machine accessing an old backup file one evening in April 2016.

SDNY News Clips, Monday, March 9, 2020 
He did so, prosecutors said, by reinstating his administrator-level access that the C.I.A. had removed after his workplace 
disputes. The file matched the documents posted by WikiLeaks, the anti-secrecy organization, nearly a year later, 
according to the government. 
The defense argued that the C.I.A. computer network had weak passwords and widely known security vulnerabilities, 
and that it was possible other C.I.A. employees or foreign adversaries had breached the system. 
Mr. Schulte's lawyers pointed to an internal C.I.A. report commissioned after the WikiLeaks debacle that found the 
agency did not know the files had been stolen until a year later. 
In particular, the defense zeroed in on a C.I.A. employee identified only as Michael. On the night of the alleged theft, 
Michael and Mr. Schulte, who were close friends, left the office together, according to a government court filing. 
The C.I.A. placed Michael on administrative leave in August because he was not cooperating with the criminal 
investigation into the data theft and had declined to take a polygraph test. 
But the government did not notify the defense about Michael's employment status until six months later, the night 
before he took the stand at trial as a government witness. 
Mr. Schulte's lawyer, Sabrina Shroff, asked in her closing argument why prosecutors had "kept this information about 
Michael to themselves." 
"It shows their doubt about the case against Mr. Schulte," she told jurors. 
During deliberations, some of the notes sent by the jury signaled it was exploring alternate culprits who might have 
committed the theft. 
The government had no direct proof that Mr. Schulte sent the files to WikiLeaks. Instead, prosecutors relied on 
circumstantial evidence. For instance, Mr. Schulte downloaded the same program onto his home computer that 
WikiLeaks recommends as a safe way to submit documents to the organization. 
Prosecutors said that after stealing the documents and sending them to WikiLeaks, Mr. Schulte "nuked" his hard drive at 
home to erase any trace of his submission. 
The trial provided a rare glimpse inside the top-secret cyberoperations of the C.I.A. Mr. Schulte was a coder in the 
agency's Engineering Development Group, which builds tools that allow C.I.A. officers to extract files from foreign 
computers without detection. 
On the witness stand, C.I.A. employees — who testified under pseudonyms or only first names — publicly 
acknowledged for the first time some of the hacking tools that had been developed by the agency. 
"Foreign governments do not want us on their networks and would complain, to put it lightly, if they caught us doing 
this," testified a C.I.A. employee, who used the pseudonym Jeremy Weber.

--- PAGE 12 ---
SDNY News Clips, Monday, March 9, 2020 
Prosecutors were careful to avoid details about specific operations. During cross-examination, Ms. Shroff asked one 
C.I.A. witness: "Do you recall a time when the C.I.A. covertly tried to read Angela Merkel's emails?" referring to the 
German chancellor. 
The government objected, and the judge stopped the witness from answering. 
The testimony revealed the scramble inside C.I.A. headquarters when the files leaked. Sean Roche, a top C.I.A. official at 
the time, said he got a call from another C.I.A. director who was out of breath. "It was the equivalent of a digital Pearl 
Harbor," he testified. 
Mr. Schulte immediately became a suspect. His personnel file indicated a willingness to violate C.I.A. policy, and his 
resignation letter accused the agency of "deep injustices and illegal behavior," witnesses testified. 
Much of the trial felt like a rehash of a workplace complaint gone horribly wrong. Mr. Schulte's primary grievance was 
with another co-worker, identified only as Amol. Their group at the C.I.A., predominantly male coders, was known for 
shooting Nerf guns and playing pranks. 
Days after the first WikiLeaks disclosure, Mr. Schulte was scheduled to fly to Mexico. 
Federal agents approached Mr. Schulte as he was leaving work at Bloomberg and took him to a cafe near Grand Central 
Terminal in New York. Mr. Schulte gave them advice about finding the leaker. His hands trembled during the 
conversation, an F.BI. agent testified. 
That night, Mr. Schulte stayed in a hotel room as F.B.I. agents, who had a search warrant, seized large volumes of data 
from his apartment. 
The defense argued that investigators were quick to scapegoat Mr. Schulte because he was an easy target; after all, he 
had antagonized virtually all of his co-workers at the C.I.A. 
Prosecutors showed jurors detailed notebooks that Mr. Schulte kept in jail while awaiting trial. His bail was revoked after 
he used the internet without the judge's permission, in violation of court orders. 
While in jail, Mr. Schulte obtained a contraband cellphone from another inmate and set up a Twitter account called 
@freejasonbourne, referring to the fictional C.I.A. operative played by the actor Matt Damon. He emailed reporters 
sensitive information about his case from an encrypted account, resulting in his conviction for contempt of court. 
In one notebook, prosecutors showed Mr. Schulte wrote a to-do list for himself, including "delete suspicious emails."

Ray 
Lawrence Ray Is the Latest Defendant To Be Convicted Before He Goes to Trial 
Frank Report 
By K.R. Claviger 
3/8/2020 
To some extent, it's always been this way: prosecutors like to get as much media coverage as possible when they 
announce arrests and indictments — especially if the defendant is well known or the alleged crime is especially 
abhorrent. 
But with the advent of 24/7 news and the spread of social media, the reality is that many cases are now being 
adjudicated in the court of public opinion long before they show up in the court of law. 
Lawrence Ray — the man who allegedly forced at least one of his daughter's friends from Sarah Lawrence College into 
prostitution — is the latest example of this rapidly increasing phenomenon. 
According to Geoffrey Berman, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York (SDNY), Ray was arrested on 
February 10th at his home in Piscataway, NJ — and charged with sex trafficking, forced labor, and extortion. 
At the time of his arrest, Ray was in bed with one of his daughter's former college roommates — a woman for whom he 
had been named guardian (I plan to do more research on that situation). 
According to Berman, Ray had groomed the woman to be a prostitute — and had kept most of the money she earned 
from her trysts. 
Alleged Prostitute's Earnings Are Extraordinary 
At Ray's arraignment on February 11th, Assistant U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon described ledgers that were confiscated 
from Ray's home at the time of his arrest. 
According to Sassoon, those ledgers indicated that Ray's alleged victim generated $700,000 in earnings in 2017 — and 
$1,000,000 in 2018. 
Let's just take a look at those numbers to see if they make any sense. 
If the alleged victim was charging an average of $500 per hookup, that would mean that she had 1,400 hookups in 2017 
— and 2,000 hookups in 2018. 
That's somewhere between 27 and 39 per week — or between 4 and 5 per day — with no days off. 
And even if the alleged victim was somehow able to charge an average of $1,000 per hookup — which seems somewhat 
unlikely — that would mean she had more than 900 hookups in 2017 and at least 1,000 in 2018.

While all of the cited figures are mathematically and physically possible, they nevertheless seem extraordinary and 
almost unimaginable. 
And should they prove to be true, they will likely cause a lot of coeds at Sarah Lawrence College and elsewhere to 
reconsider their career options. 
The Whole Story Is Somewhat Unimaginable 
According to prosecutors, the exploitation began in 2010 when Ray moved into an on-campus dorm with his daughter 
and several of her sophomore classmates at the college. 
As outlined in his indictment, "Ray began 'therapy' sessions with some roommates purportedly to help them with their 
psychological problems, and presented himself as a father figure to the roommates". 
The indictment further alleges that Ray spent almost a decade physically, psychologically and sexually abusing his 
victims. 
Some of his alleged victims were required to perform unpaid labor at Ray's behest — while others were forced to drain 
money from their personal bank accounts and those of their parents. 
Prosecutors indicated that the alleged crimes involved as many as five victims — and that they took place in Westchester 
County, Manhattan, and North Carolina. 
Ray has been charged with a total of nine felony counts — and could be facing more than 100 years in federal prison if he 
were to be found guilty of all of them. 
Allegations First Emerged in 2019 
Adding to the story's unbelievability is the fact that in April 2019, New York magazine published a story that included 
many of the same accusations that are set forth in the indictment. 
According to a statement that was released by Sarah Lawrence College at the time of Ray's arrest, it undertook an 
"internal investigation" of the specific activities that were described in the New York magazine article but did not 
substantiate any of those claims. 
In that same statement, the college indicated that "We have not been contacted by the Southern District of New York, 
but will, of course, cooperate in their investigation to the full extent of the law if invited to do so". 
Why the SDNY investigators would not have discussed the matter with college officials is just one of the many mysteries 
surrounding this case. 
This May Be Another Case Where the Results Are OK but Not the Process 
Maybe Lawrence Ray is a total scumbag who deserves to spend the rest of his life in prison.

SDNY News Clips, Monday, March 9, 2020 
But the way in which this case has been handled thus far — with the salacious claims made by the U.D. Attorney for the 
SDNY at the press conference it held to announce Ray's arrest and the subsequent leaks to the media concerning the 
materials that were seized at Ray's home — it's starting to look a lot like the script that's been followed in other recent 
high-profile prosecutions. 
What the hell has happened to due process — and the presumption of innocence before someone is found guilty? 
Why do prosecutors feel it's necessary to try their cases in the court of public opinion before they go to trial? 
How is it possible to select objective jurors who have not formed an opinion about cases like this when everyone who 
watches TV and/or who has an internet connection is bombarded for months with news about the case before it goes to 
trial? 
Have we reached a point where trials are no longer necessary — and we're ready to just let prosecutors decide who's 
guilty of committing a crime? 
Is this really what the founders of America had in mind when they were drafting the U.S. Constitution?

US Attorney Geoffrey Berman asserts independence from Justice Department 
CNN 
By Kara Scannell 
3/9/2020 
(CNN) — Geoffrey Berman, the US attorney in Manhattan, asserted his office's independence from politics on Monday in 
his first public comments since career prosecutors have clashed with Justice Department leadership over the handling of 
politically sensitive cases. 
Berman's rare remarks follow actions taken by Attorney General William Barr, from his characterization of former 
special counsel Robert Mueller's investigative conclusions to the sentencing of Trump ally Roger Stone, that have raised 
concerns among current and former prosecutors that Barr is doing the bidding of the President and politicizing the 
Justice Department. 
Berman, who was appointed by President Donald Trump, was asked by a reporter at a press conference whether the 
Justice Department had interfered in his office's investigation of Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, two associates of Rudy 
Giuliani, Trump's personal attorney. 
Parnas and Fruman, who were charged with campaign finance violations, worked with Giuliani in his effort to dig up dirt 
on former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter's activities in Ukraine. Prosecutors are also investigating Giuliani's 
efforts in Ukraine, including his attempt to remove then-US ambassador Marie Yovanovitch. 
"The Southern District of New York has a long history of integrity and pursuing cases and declining to pursue cases based 
only on the facts and the law and the equities, without regard to partisan political concerns. My primary commitment is 
and has been to maintain those core values and that's how our office is operating," Berman said. 
Berman's statement is the first time he has spoken out about the independence of the US Attorney's Office for the 
Southern District of New York, which has had a long history of operating apart from the Justice Department and often 
handles high-profile cases. 
Since Barr became attorney general last year, there has been tension between him and Berman. Barr has attempted to a 
micromanage certain cases by asking more questions than his predecessors, according to people familiar with the 
relationship. Berman has pushed back, these people say, and recently moved to indict a Turkish bank over Barr's efforts 
to reach a settlement that would have avoided an indictment. 
Barr clashed with federal prosecutors in recent weeks over the handling of two high-profile cases that touch the 
President, the sentencing of Stone and the oversight of the prosecution of Michael Flynn, Trump's former national 
security adviser. Barr assigned the US attorney from St. Louis with re-examining the Flynn investigation, among others. 
He also created a new framework for investigations relating to Ukraine with the appointment of the US attorney in 
Brooklyn to coordinate any existing investigations and approve the "widening and expansion of existing matters," 
according to an internal Justice Department memorandum.

That move was perceived by some former prosecutors as an attempt to assert more control over investigations tied to 
Ukraine, especially those carried out by the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York. In addition to the 
Giuliani investigation, prosecutors are also looking into whether foreign money flowed into Trump's inaugural 
committee. The office also prosecuted Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal attorney, for violating campaign finance 
laws in connection to payments made to two women who alleged affairs with Trump.

Barr 
Judge's blistering opinion reveals William Barr's unfitness 
CNN 
By Elie Honig 
3/9/2020 
(CNN) — As a Justice Department prosecutor, I was taught that all you have is your credibility and your independence. 
Without those two attributes, you're lost. But in a scalding opinion, federal District Court Judge Reggie Walton called 
into serious doubt whether Attorney General William Barr possesses either of these golden prosecutorial virtues (and 
before anyone cries politics, Judge Walton was nominated to the bench by President George W. Bush, a Republican, in 
2001). 
Judge Walton's opinion pulls no punches. He finds that "the Court cannot reconcile certain public representations made 
by Attorney General Barr with the findings in the Mueller Report." (Judge Walton is hardly alone in this assessment; 
Mueller himself castigated Barr for "not fully captur[ing] the context, nature, and substance of this Office's work and 
conclusions.") The judge notes Barr's "lack of candor" which "call[s] into question Attorney General Barr's credibility and 
in turn, the Department's representation" that it had properly redacted the Mueller report in the Freedom of 
Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit before the Court. 
The Justice Department released a statement taking issue with the judge's ruling, noting that its attorneys worked with 
Mueller's team to redact the report. But it completely misses the point. Judge Walton criticizes Barr not for the 
redactions made to the Mueller report, but rather for Barr's misleading public comments about it. The Justice 
Department is silent on this issue. 
Having already trashed Barr's credibility, Judge Walton then turned his fire on Barr's lack of political independence, 
noting that Barr's public "inconsistencies" with the Mueller report -- at a time when the public did not have access to the 
report itself -- "cause the Court to seriously question whether Attorney General Barr made a calculated attempt to 
influence public discourse about the Mueller Report in favor of President Trump..." 
For a former Justice Department prosecutor like myself, this is a jaw-dropper. Not only does a Republican-nominated 
federal judge call out Barr for fudging the truth, but he further questions whether Barr did it to protect the President --
precisely the opposite of what the Justice Department is, and should be, about. 
Judge Walton's scathing decision has led to a humiliating result not just for Barr but for the entire Justice Department. In 
a FOIA lawsuit, a judge typically defers heavily to the Department to make necessary and appropriate redactions to any 
materials before they are released to the public. Here, however, Judge Walton has essentially said: I don't trust you to 
do this honestly, so I'll have to babysit you and review your work first. (Fool me once...) 
A ruling like Judge Walton's would derail the career of any line-level prosecutor. In my 14 years as a federal and state 
prosecutor, neither I nor any of my hundreds of colleagues were ever called out anywhere near so bluntly and forcefully 
by a judge. Judge Walton's powerful words confirm what thousands of former Justice Department prosecutors and 
officials (including me) already firmly believe: Barr is unfit to serve as Attorney General.

Harvey Weinstein injured in Rikers Island jail, his publicist says 
CNN 
By Chloe Melas and Ralph Ellis 
3/9/2020 
(CNN) — Convicted rapist Harvey Weinstein fell sometime Sunday morning while at Rikers Island jail, his spokesperson 
Juda Englemayer told CNN. 
Englemayer said Weinstein was dizzy before he fell. 
"Harvey says his head throbs all the time and thinks he has a concussion. He has not been officially diagnosed," 
Englemayer said. 
Englemayer, who spoke to Weinstein by phone Sunday evening, says Weinstein has "had a lot of time to think about his 
life and what he's done," adding, "He said he wasn't a nice guy and that's how he got here." 
Movie mogul Weinstein doesn't walk steadily and doesn't have a walker in jail, Englemayer said. During his recent trial, 
Weinstein used a walker to get in and out of court. 
After Weinstein was convicted of sex crimes February 24, paramedics determined he had a heart issue and transported 
him to Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan. 
Weinstein, 67, had a heart procedure last Wednesday during which doctors inserted a stent, Engelmayer told CNN 
recently. He was moved Thursday to the infirmary unit at Rikers Island, New York's main jail complex, Engelmayer said. 
He's expected to be sentenced March 11 in New York State Supreme Court. He faces a minimum of five years and a 
maximum of more than two decades in prison. 
A New York jury convicted Weinstein of committing a criminal sex act in the first degree involving one woman and 
another count of rape in the third degree.

SDNY Courthouses Ban Entry To Any Exposed To Coronavirus 
Law360 
By Frank G. Runyeon 
3/9/2020 
Law360, New York (March 9, 2020, 11:10 AM EDT) -- The Southern District of New York on Monday enacted new 
restrictions on who may enter the courts due to the coronavirus outbreak, barring entry to anyone who recently 
traveled to countries that are hardest hit by the virus or those who have come into contact with it. 
In an order, Chief Judge Colleen McMahon said the ban applies to anyone who has traveled to China, South Korea, 
Japan, Italy or Iran in the past 14 days. Also banned are people who live with or have come into close contact with 
anyone who has been in one of those countries during that period; people who have been asked to self-quarantine; and 
those who have either been diagnosed with the virus — called COVID-19 — or come into contact with someone who has 
been diagnosed. 
The order cited guidance by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control that the best way to avoid illness is by avoiding the 
virus altogether. 
"Anyone attempting to enter in violation of these protocols will be denied entry by a court security officer," Judge 
McMahon wrote. She added that the restrictions would "remain in place temporarily until it is determined to be safe to 
remove them."

Prince Andrew 'shut the door' on Epstein probe cooperation: U.S. prosecutor 
Reuters 
By Brendan Pierson and Mark Hosenball 
3/9/2020 
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Britain's Prince Andrew has declined to cooperate with a U.S. investigation into possible co-
conspirators of deceased financier and accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, a U.S. prosecutor said on Monday. 
"Contrary to Prince Andrew's very public offer to cooperate with our investigation into Epstein's co-conspirators, an 
offer that was conveyed via press release, Prince Andrew has now completely shut the door on voluntary cooperation 
and our office is considering its options," U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman said when asked about Epstein at a news 
conference about an unrelated case. 
Berman's spokesman James Margolin declined comment on the options being considered. He said the prince's lawyers 
had said Andrew would not submit voluntarily to an interview. He said this was after Jan. 27, when Berman told a news 
conference Andrew had not offered any cooperation. 
Andrew, 60, had said in a public statement in November that he was stepping down from public duties and would be 
willing to help "any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required." 
A friend of Epstein's, the prince has not been accused of criminal wrongdoing. He has described his association with the 
financier as "ill-judged." A spokeswoman for the royal family declined comment. 
Clare Montgomery, a senior London barrister who British news reports say represents Andrew on matters related to 
Epstein, also declined to comment, citing professional rules limiting her ability to speak publicly about legal issues. 
Andrew, Queen Elizabeth's second son, has denied an accusation by a woman who said she was trafficked by Epstein 
and forced to have sex with his friends, including the prince, when she was 17. 
A U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation probe is focusing on British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, a longtime associate of 
Epstein's, and others who facilitated the wealthy financier's alleged trafficking of underage girls, law enforcement 
sources told Reuters in December. 
Epstein had socialized with the prince and other high-profile figures including U.S. President Donald Trump and former 
president Bill Clinton. 
Epstein's suicide in Manhattan's Metropolitan Correctional Center in August, at age 66, occurred little over a month 
after he was arrested and charged with trafficking dozens of underage girls as young as 14 from at least 2002 to 2005. 
Prosecutors said he recruited girls to give him massages, which became sexual in nature. Epstein had pleaded not guilty.

Jail captain in charge when Jeffrey Epstein hanged himself to be transferred: sources 
NY Daily News 
By Stephen Rex Brown 
3/9/2020 
He's certainly no stranger to emergencies. 
The Metropolitan Correctional Center captain in charge when Jeffrey Epstein hanged himself is expected to be 
transferred to a new lockup where he will serve as "emergency preparedness officer," sources tell the Daily News. 
Jermaine Darden's move to FCI Fort Dix, a low-security prison in Burlington County, N.J., was delayed due to the ongoing 
lockdown at the dysfunctional jail in lower Manhattan, according to a source. 
As captain, Darden oversees lieutenants and correctional officers at MCC. Among those under his command were 
Officers Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, who are accused of sleeping on the job and falsifying records the night of 
Epstein's death. 
A source doubted that Darden was at the jail when Epstein was found hanging in his cell at 6:30 a.m. on Aug. 10 but was 
confident he was one of the first people called about it. 
Thomas' attorney Montell Figgins said Darden's transfer and new title was yet another example of the upper ranks of 
the Metropolitan Correctional Center facing no consequences for systemic Bureau of Prisons failures that allowed the 
accused sex trafficker to avoid facing justice. 
"It shows you the hubris of the system," Figgins said. "They couldn't care less about the reality of what they're dong. 
They would take this person, who was involved in this incident, and give him another title?" 
Darden, 48, declined to comment. 
The transfer follows a pattern similar to that of Lamine N'Diaye, the correctional center warden during the Epstein 
debacle. N'Diaye was moved to a desk job at a regional office in Pennsylvania days after the suicide. He was expected to 
assume a leadership role at Fort Dix in February until U.S. Attorney General William Barr intervened and ordered the 
transfer be put on hold while investigations into Epstein's death continue, The Associated Press reported. 
Darden's new title at Fort Dix could come with a pay raise, a source said. 
Working at the low-security lockup in New Jersey should be less stressful than at the Metropolitan Correctional Center. 
The 12-story jail next door to Manhattan Federal Court has been reeling since Epstein's suicide. The building's 
infrastructure is crumbling. Morale is at rock bottom following the arrests of Thomas and Noel. A gun smuggled into the 
jail prompted an ongoing lockdown and forced overworked staff to put in even longer hours. The FBI is investigating the 
flow of contraband into the facility.

A gun smuggled into the jail prompted an ongoing lockdown and forced overworked staff to put in even longer hours. 
The FBI is investigating the flow of contraband into the facility. 
Figgins made the case that Darden's leadership was one of many problems at the Metropolitan Correctional Center at 
the time of Epstein's suicide. 
"They don't have any pictures of what happened that night because they didn't follow proper protocol," Figgins said. 
"And yet he gets another position." 
The Bureau of Prisons declined to comment on personnel decisions. 
Thomas and Noel have pleaded not guilty to charges including filing false records, which carries a maximum sentence of 
five years.

Navarro 
Horse racing trainers and veterinarians charged in international doping scandal 
NBC 
By Tom Winter and David K. Li 
3/9/2020 
More than two dozen trainers, veterinarians and others in horse racing were charged in a widespread doping scheme 
that "amounted to nothing less than abuse," federal officials and court papers revealed Monday. 
The defendants ran horses at tracks in New York, New Jersey, Florida, Ohio, Kentucky and the United Arab Emirates, 
federal prosecutors in New York City said. 
"Over the course of the scheme, participants manufactured, purchased, sold, shipped, delivered, received and 
administered thousands of units" of performance-enhancing drugs, or PEDs, for use on racehorses, U.S. Attorney 
Geoffrey Berman wrote in charging documents against 19 of 27 defendants. 
The indicted included 11 trainers, seven veterinarians and nine drug suppliers and distributors, according to Berman. 
"All involved in the cruel and systematic doping of racehorses across the United States and indeed around the world 
using misbranded, adulated and dangerous performance-enhancing drugs," Berman told reporters in New York. 
"This is the most far-reaching prosecution of racehorse doping in the history of the Department of Justice." 
William F. Sweeney Jr., the FBI's assistant director in charge of the New York office, said this practice forced horses to 
run faster than they really could, putting them in grave danger. 
"These substances stimulated endurance, deadened nerves, increased oxygen intake and reduced inflammation," 
Sweeney told reporters. "What actually happened to these horses amounted to nothing less than abuse." 
He added: "They experienced cardiac issues, overexertion leading to leg fractures, increased risk of injury and in some 
cases death." 
As of now, investigators said they have not found any evidence that defendants told anyone about their doping scheme 
so to make bets on juiced horses. But they allegedly profited on hefty prize money. 
"Conversely, the human beings in the scheme continued to line their purses as they manipulated this multiple-billion-
dollar horse racing industry across the globe," Sweeney said. "People are rightfully disturbed by the mistreatment of 
animals who have absolutely no means of defense." 
Prosecutors said trainer Jorge Navarro "orchestrated" this scheme by "using PEDs designed to evade drug tests, 
physically concealing containers of PEDs and drug paraphernalia from state regulators and racing officials."

One of Navarro's most prized thoroughbreds, X Y Jet, died of an apparent heart attack this year after receiving a 
significant amount of PEDs, in one instance 50 injections, according to the indictment. 
X Y Jet won the prestigious Dubai Golden Shaheen at Meydan Racecourse in Dubai in March 2019, which paid $1.5 
million to the winner, highlighting a career of 12 victories and more than $3 million in earnings. The horse won that race 
and another contest in February of last year in Florida after receiving adulterated and misbranded PEDs before both 
races, according to the indictment. 
While in the UAE for the Dubai race, Navarro "personally administered various adulterated and misbranded PEDs to X Y 
Jet, including a substance Navarro referred to as 'monkey,' " according to the indictment. 
"Monkey" is a commonly used code word for a drug that can "boost a racehorse's red blood cell count in order to 
stimulate endurance during a race and improve race recover," according to the indictment. 
But those drugs, "when combined with intense physical exertion, thicken the horse's blood, thereby causing increased 
cardiac exertion and pressure, which can lead to cardiac issues or death," the indictment said. 
Navarro and another high profile trainer, Jason Servis, were both indicted on a count of conspiracy of drug adulteration 
and misbranding. 
Navarro allegedly told Servis in an intercepted phone call on March 5 last year that he particularly liked a PED called SGF-
1000. 
"I've been using it on everything almost," Navarro told Servis. Navarro ended the phone call a short time later, saying, "I 
don't want to talk about this s--- on the phone, OK," according to prosecutors. 
Servis is the trainer of Maximum Security, who crossed the finish line first at last year's Kentucky Derby but was 
disqualified minutes later after stewards ruled that the horse had impeded the paths of others; Country House was 
declared the winner. Maximum Security won the Eclipse Award as horse racing's top 3-year-old colt in 2019. 
Before a race later that year at Monmouth Park in Oceanport, New Jersey, Servis was caught on an intercepted 
telephone call with veterinarian and co-defendant Kristian Rhein, according to the indictment. The veterinarian assured 
Servis that a PED given to Maximum Security wouldn't show up on a test. 
"They don't even have a test for it," Rhein told Servis, the indictment alleged. "There's no test for it in America." 
Federal agents specializing in organize crime probes were investigating a "different case, on a different topic all 
together" before they tripped on to the doping scheme and "one thing led to another," according to Sweeney. 
"We had one agent in particular (who) was actually an expert in this industry from (a) prior life," Sweeney said. "He was 
part of the team and they did great work." 
The indictments show how widespread illegal drugs are in horse racing, according to People for the Ethical Treatment of 
Animals.

"This sweeping federal investigation has exposed that illegal doping is still ubiquitous in horse racing, including at the 
highest levels," PETA Senior Vice President Kathy Guillermo said in a statement. 
"These crimes cheat bettors of billions of dollars and are egregiously cruel to horses, resulting in rampant injuries, pain, 
and deaths, such as those cited in the indictment."

Maximum Security trainer among 27 indicted in racehorse doping scheme 
NY Post 
By Gabrielle Fonrouge 
3/9/2020 
The trainer behind the world's best racehorse, Maximum Security, along with 26 others have been indicted in the largest 
crackdown on racehorse doping the Department of Justice has ever seen, Manhattan federal prosecutors announced 
Monday. 
Jason Servis, who just led Maximum Security to a 510 million victory in last month's Saudi Cup, allegedly used everything 
from customized painkillers to blood thickeners on "virtually all of the racehorses under his control" to make them 
"unnaturally fast," prosecutors alleged. 
"These defendants engaged in this conduct not for the love of the sport, and certainly not out of concern for the horses, 
but for money," US Attorney for the Southern District of New York Geoffrey Berman said Monday. "And it was the 
racehorses that paid the price for the defendants' unbridled greed." 
Prosecutors alleged the international scheme spanned racetracks in New York, New Jersey, Florida, Ohio, Kentucky and 
the United Arab Emirates and could have killed a number of horses. 
"You know how many [expletive] horses he [Navarro] [expletive] killed and broke down that I made disappear? ... You 
know how much trouble he could get in ... if they found out ... the six horses we killed?" Nicholas Surick, one of the 
indicted trainers, wrote in a text message about co-conspirator Jorge Navarro, another high-profile horse trainer. 
One of Navarro's award-winning steeds, X Y Jet, died of an apparent heart attack in January after receiving over 50 
injections of performance-enhancing drugs, an indictment against Navarro alleges. 
Berman said X Y Jet's death is still under investigation. 
The probe, started two years ago by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, turned up a total of nine trainers, nine 
suppliers and seven crooked veterinarians who used blood thickeners, painkillers and bronchodilators to dope the 
horses. 
"These substances stimulated endurance, deadened nerves, increased oxygen intake and reduced inflammation," 
William Sweeney, assistant director in charge of the FBI's New York office, said at a press conference. 
"What actually happened to these horses amounted to nothing less than abuse." 
Sweeney said the PEDs caused the horses to have "cardiac issues" and led to "overexertion," which can cause leg 
fractures and death. 
One of the indicted veterinarians, Dr. Louis Grasso, who'd previously been investigated for a racehorse doping scheme, 
allegedly distributed "cobra venom" to trainers as a painkiller and filled out prescriptions under the names of canine 
patients to keep investigators off his tail, according to court records and Paulick Report. 
"I don't give a f—k what it is," Grasso allegedly told co-conspirator and fellow racehorse trainer Thomas Guido III when 
saying he charges "5100 per script," according to an indictment against him. 
Grasso then allegedly boasted to an undercover officer that he could get "a script for anything," records show. 
Investigators alleged Grasso submitted false prescriptions to over 10 pharmacies in at least seven states in 2019 alone 
and was caught counseling Guido after one of his horses died, the indictment states.

SONY News Clips, Monday, March 9, 2020 
"It happens ... [the trainer] probably over juiced him," Grasso allegedly said. "I've seen that happen 20 times." 
A total of 26 out of the 27 defendants were arrested Monday while another defendant, Seth Fishman, was previously 
arrested in October. Servis got hit with a charge of misbranding conspiracy, which relates to mislabeling drugs. 
They collectively face a total of 105 years in prison, prosecutors said.

Terrorism and International Narcotics 
Schulte 
Trial of Programmer Accused in C.I.A. Leak Ends in Hung Jury 
NYT 
By Nicole Hong 
3/9/2020 
An office of the Central Intelligence Agency outside Washington turned into a crime scene on March 7, 2017. 
WikiLeaks had just published a trove of confidential C.I.A. documents that revealed secret methods the spy agency used 
to penetrate the computer networks of foreign governments and terrorists. 
Investigators scrambled to find the culprit, seizing more than 1,000 devices from the C.I.A. as top-secret operations and 
computer networks shut down. Eventually, they arrested Joshua Schulte, 31, who worked as a computer engineer for 
the agency. 
But on Monday, in a muddled outcome for the government, a federal jury in Manhattan could not agree on whether to 
convict Mr. Schulte of the biggest theft of classified documents in C.I.A. history. 
After hearing four weeks of testimony, the jurors deadlocked on eight counts, including illegal gathering and 
transmission of national defense information. They did convict Mr. Schulte on two other counts — contempt of court 
and making false statements to the F.B.I. 
The motivation for the alleged theft, prosecutors said, was Mr. Schulte's belief that C.I.A. management did not take his 
workplace complaints seriously. His feuding with co-workers led to his resignation in November 2016 to join Bloomberg 
L.P. as a software engineer. 
The partial verdict came after six days of chaotic deliberations. One juror was dismissed in the middle of the discussions 
because she violated the judge's orders by researching the case, and then shared that information with the jury. The 
judge declined to replace her with an alternate, leaving a panel of 11 people. 
The jury also complained in a note about a separate juror who was not participating in the group discussion, raising 
concerns about "her attitude." 
After the verdict, one juror said the deliberations were a "horrible experience," her eyes welling with tears as she 
walked away from reporters. 
Mr. Schulte's legal troubles are not over. The government could retry the case. In addition, during the investigation, 
federal agents found more than 10,000 images and videos of child pornography on electronic devices in Mr. Schulte's 
home. He faces a separate federal trial on those charges. 
The verdict showed that the jury had doubts about the government's most important evidence, which came from a 
C.I.A. server. Trial witnesses guided jurors through a complicated maze of forensic analysis that, according to 
prosecutors, showed Mr. Schulte's work machine accessing an old backup file one evening in April 2016.

SDNY News Clips, Monday, March 9, 2020 
He did so, prosecutors said, by reinstating his administrator-level access that the C.I.A. had removed after his workplace 
disputes. The file matched the documents posted by WikiLeaks, the anti-secrecy organization, nearly a year later, 
according to the government. 
The defense argued that the C.I.A. computer network had weak passwords and widely known security vulnerabilities, 
and that it was possible other C.I.A. employees or foreign adversaries had breached the system. 
Mr. Schulte's lawyers pointed to an internal C.I.A. report commissioned after the WikiLeaks debacle that found the 
agency did not know the files had been stolen until a year later. 
In particular, the defense zeroed in on a C.I.A. employee identified only as Michael. On the night of the alleged theft, 
Michael and Mr. Schulte, who were close friends, left the office together, according to a government court filing. 
The C.I.A. placed Michael on administrative leave in August because he was not cooperating with the criminal 
investigation into the data theft and had declined to take a polygraph test. 
But the government did not notify the defense about Michael's employment status until six months later, the night 
before he took the stand at trial as a government witness. 
Mr. Schulte's lawyer, Sabrina Shroff, asked in her closing argument why prosecutors had "kept this information about 
Michael to themselves." 
"It shows their doubt about the case against Mr. Schulte," she told jurors. 
During deliberations, some of the notes sent by the jury signaled it was exploring alternate culprits who might have 
committed the theft. 
The government had no direct proof that Mr. Schulte sent the files to WikiLeaks. Instead, prosecutors relied on 
circumstantial evidence. For instance, Mr. Schulte downloaded the same program onto his home computer that 
WikiLeaks recommends as a safe way to submit documents to the organization. 
Prosecutors said that after stealing the documents and sending them to WikiLeaks, Mr. Schulte "nuked" his hard drive at 
home to erase any trace of his submission. 
The trial provided a rare glimpse inside the top-secret cyberoperations of the C.I.A. Mr. Schulte was a coder in the 
agency's Engineering Development Group, which builds tools that allow C.I.A. officers to extract files from foreign 
computers without detection. 
On the witness stand, C.I.A. employees — who testified under pseudonyms or only first names — publicly 
acknowledged for the first time some of the hacking tools that had been developed by the agency. 
"Foreign governments do not want us on their networks and would complain, to put it lightly, if they caught us doing 
this," testified a C.I.A. employee, who used the pseudonym Jeremy Weber. 
EFTA00014273

SDNY News Clips, Monday, March 9, 2020 
Prosecutors were careful to avoid details about specific operations. During cross-examination, Ms. Shroff asked one 
C.I.A. witness: "Do you recall a time when the C.I.A. covertly tried to read Angela Merkel's emails?" referring to the 
German chancellor. 
The government objected, and the judge stopped the witness from answering. 
The testimony revealed the scramble inside C.I.A. headquarters when the files leaked. Sean Roche, a top C.I.A. official at 
the time, said he got a call from another C.I.A. director who was out of breath. "It was the equivalent of a digital Pearl 
Harbor," he testified. 
Mr. Schulte immediately became a suspect. His personnel file indicated a willingness to violate C.I.A. policy, and his 
resignation letter accused the agency of "deep injustices and illegal behavior," witnesses testified. 
Much of the trial felt like a rehash of a workplace complaint gone horribly wrong. Mr. Schulte's primary grievance was 
with another co-worker, identified only as Amol. Their group at the C.I.A., predominantly male coders, was known for 
shooting Nerf guns and playing pranks. 
Days after the first WikiLeaks disclosure, Mr. Schulte was scheduled to fly to Mexico. 
Federal agents approached Mr. Schulte as he was leaving work at Bloomberg and took him to a cafe near Grand Central 
Terminal in New York. Mr. Schulte gave them advice about finding the leaker. His hands trembled during the 
conversation, an F.BI. agent testified. 
That night, Mr. Schulte stayed in a hotel room as F.B.I. agents, who had a search warrant, seized large volumes of data 
from his apartment. 
The defense argued that investigators were quick to scapegoat Mr. Schulte because he was an easy target; after all, he 
had antagonized virtually all of his co-workers at the C.I.A. 
Prosecutors showed jurors detailed notebooks that Mr. Schulte kept in jail while awaiting trial. His bail was revoked after 
he used the internet without the judge's permission, in violation of court orders. 
While in jail, Mr. Schulte obtained a contraband cellphone from another inmate and set up a Twitter account called 
@freejasonbourne, referring to the fictional C.I.A. operative played by the actor Matt Damon. He emailed reporters 
sensitive information about his case from an encrypted account, resulting in his conviction for contempt of court. 
In one notebook, prosecutors showed Mr. Schulte wrote a to-do list for himself, including "delete suspicious emails."

Violent and Organized Crime 
Ray 
Lawrence Ray Is the Latest Defendant To Be Convicted Before He Goes to Trial 
Frank Report 
By K.R. Claviger 
3/8/2020 
To some extent, it's always been this way: prosecutors like to get as much media coverage as possible when they 
announce arrests and indictments — especially if the defendant is well known or the alleged crime is especially 
abhorrent. 
But with the advent of 24/7 news and the spread of social media, the reality is that many cases are now being 
adjudicated in the court of public opinion long before they show up in the court of law. 
Lawrence Ray — the man who allegedly forced at least one of his daughter's friends from Sarah Lawrence College into 
prostitution — is the latest example of this rapidly increasing phenomenon. 
According to Geoffrey Berman, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York (SDNY), Ray was arrested on 
February 10th at his home in Piscataway, NJ — and charged with sex trafficking, forced labor, and extortion. 
At the time of his arrest, Ray was in bed with one of his daughter's former college roommates — a woman for whom he 
had been named guardian (I plan to do more research on that situation). 
According to Berman, Ray had groomed the woman to be a prostitute — and had kept most of the money she earned 
from her trysts. 
Alleged Prostitute's Earnings Are Extraordinary 
At Ray's arraignment on February 11th, Assistant U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon described ledgers that were confiscated 
from Ray's home at the time of his arrest. 
According to Sassoon, those ledgers indicated that Ray's alleged victim generated $700,000 in earnings in 2017 — and 
$1,000,000 in 2018. 
Let's just take a look at those numbers to see if they make any sense. 
If the alleged victim was charging an average of $500 per hookup, that would mean that she had 1,400 hookups in 2017 
— and 2,000 hookups in 2018. 
That's somewhere between 27 and 39 per week — or between 4 and 5 per day — with no days off. 
And even if the alleged victim was somehow able to charge an average of $1,000 per hookup — which seems somewhat 
unlikely — that would mean she had more than 900 hookups in 2017 and at least 1,000 in 2018. 
EFTA00014275

SDNY News Clips, Monday, March 9, 2020 
While all of the cited figures are mathematically and physically possible, they nevertheless seem extraordinary and 
almost unimaginable. 
And should they prove to be true, they will likely cause a lot of coeds at Sarah Lawrence College and elsewhere to 
reconsider their career options. 
The Whole Story Is Somewhat Unimaginable 
According to prosecutors, the exploitation began in 2010 when Ray moved into an on-campus dorm with his daughter 
and several of her sophomore classmates at the college. 
As outlined in his indictment, "Ray began 'therapy' sessions with some roommates purportedly to help them with their 
psychological problems, and presented himself as a father figure to the roommates". 
The indictment further alleges that Ray spent almost a decade physically, psychologically and sexually abusing his 
victims. 
Some of his alleged victims were required to perform unpaid labor at Ray's behest — while others were forced to drain 
money from their personal bank accounts and those of their parents. 
Prosecutors indicated that the alleged crimes involved as many as five victims — and that they took place in Westchester 
County, Manhattan, and North Carolina. 
Ray has been charged with a total of nine felony counts — and could be facing more than 100 years in federal prison if he 
were to be found guilty of all of them. 
Allegations First Emerged in 2019 
Adding to the story's unbelievability is the fact that in April 2019, New York magazine published a story that included 
many of the same accusations that are set forth in the indictment. 
According to a statement that was released by Sarah Lawrence College at the time of Ray's arrest, it undertook an 
"internal investigation" of the specific activities that were described in the New York magazine article but did not 
substantiate any of those claims. 
In that same statement, the college indicated that "We have not been contacted by the Southern District of New York, 
but will, of course, cooperate in their investigation to the full extent of the law if invited to do so". 
Why the SDNY investigators would not have discussed the matter with college officials is just one of the many mysteries 
surrounding this case. 
This May Be Another Case Where the Results Are OK but Not the Process 
Maybe Lawrence Ray is a total scumbag who deserves to spend the rest of his life in prison. 
EFTA00014276

SDNY News Clips, Monday, March 9, 2020 
But the way in which this case has been handled thus far — with the salacious claims made by the U.D. Attorney for the 
SDNY at the press conference it held to announce Ray's arrest and the subsequent leaks to the media concerning the 
materials that were seized at Ray's home — it's starting to look a lot like the script that's been followed in other recent 
high-profile prosecutions. 
What the hell has happened to due process — and the presumption of innocence before someone is found guilty? 
Why do prosecutors feel it's necessary to try their cases in the court of public opinion before they go to trial? 
How is it possible to select objective jurors who have not formed an opinion about cases like this when everyone who 
watches TV and/or who has an internet connection is bombarded for months with news about the case before it goes to 
trial? 
Have we reached a point where trials are no longer necessary — and we're ready to just let prosecutors decide who's 
guilty of committing a crime? 
Is this really what the founders of America had in mind when they were drafting the U.S. Constitution?

US Attorney Geoffrey Berman asserts independence from Justice Department 
CNN 
By Kara Scannell 
3/9/2020 
(CNN) — Geoffrey Berman, the US attorney in Manhattan, asserted his office's independence from politics on Monday in 
his first public comments since career prosecutors have clashed with Justice Department leadership over the handling of 
politically sensitive cases. 
Berman's rare remarks follow actions taken by Attorney General William Barr, from his characterization of former 
special counsel Robert Mueller's investigative conclusions to the sentencing of Trump ally Roger Stone, that have raised 
concerns among current and former prosecutors that Barr is doing the bidding of the President and politicizing the 
Justice Department. 
Berman, who was appointed by President Donald Trump, was asked by a reporter at a press conference whether the 
Justice Department had interfered in his office's investigation of Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, two associates of Rudy 
Giuliani, Trump's personal attorney. 
Parnas and Fruman, who were charged with campaign finance violations, worked with Giuliani in his effort to dig up dirt 
on former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter's activities in Ukraine. Prosecutors are also investigating Giuliani's 
efforts in Ukraine, including his attempt to remove then-US ambassador Marie Yovanovitch. 
"The Southern District of New York has a long history of integrity and pursuing cases and declining to pursue cases based 
only on the facts and the law and the equities, without regard to partisan political concerns. My primary commitment is 
and has been to maintain those core values and that's how our office is operating," Berman said. 
Berman's statement is the first time he has spoken out about the independence of the US Attorney's Office for the 
Southern District of New York, which has had a long history of operating apart from the Justice Department and often 
handles high-profile cases. 
Since Barr became attorney general last year, there has been tension between him and Berman. Barr has attempted to a 
micromanage certain cases by asking more questions than his predecessors, according to people familiar with the 
relationship. Berman has pushed back, these people say, and recently moved to indict a Turkish bank over Barr's efforts 
to reach a settlement that would have avoided an indictment. 
Barr clashed with federal prosecutors in recent weeks over the handling of two high-profile cases that touch the 
President, the sentencing of Stone and the oversight of the prosecution of Michael Flynn, Trump's former national 
security adviser. Barr assigned the US attorney from St. Louis with re-examining the Flynn investigation, among others. 
He also created a new framework for investigations relating to Ukraine with the appointment of the US attorney in 
Brooklyn to coordinate any existing investigations and approve the "widening and expansion of existing matters," 
according to an internal Justice Department memorandum.

That move was perceived by some former prosecutors as an attempt to assert more control over investigations tied to 
Ukraine, especially those carried out by the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York. In addition to the 
Giuliani investigation, prosecutors are also looking into whether foreign money flowed into Trump's inaugural 
committee. The office also prosecuted Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal attorney, for violating campaign finance 
laws in connection to payments made to two women who alleged affairs with Trump.

Judge's blistering opinion reveals William Barr's unfitness 
CNN 
By Elie Honig 
3/9/2020 
(CNN) — As a Justice Department prosecutor, I was taught that all you have is your credibility and your independence. 
Without those two attributes, you're lost. But in a scalding opinion, federal District Court Judge Reggie Walton called 
into serious doubt whether Attorney General William Barr possesses either of these golden prosecutorial virtues (and 
before anyone cries politics, Judge Walton was nominated to the bench by President George W. Bush, a Republican, in 
2001). 
Judge Walton's opinion pulls no punches. He finds that "the Court cannot reconcile certain public representations made 
by Attorney General Barr with the findings in the Mueller Report." (Judge Walton is hardly alone in this assessment; 
Mueller himself castigated Barr for "not fully captur[ingj the context, nature, and substance of this Office's work and 
conclusions.") The judge notes Barr's "lack of candor" which "call[s) into question Attorney General Barr's credibility and 
in turn, the Department's representation" that it had properly redacted the Mueller report in the Freedom of 
Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit before the Court. 
The Justice Department released a statement taking issue with the judge's ruling, noting that its attorneys worked with 
Mueller's team to redact the report. But it completely misses the point. Judge Walton criticizes Barr not for the 
redactions made to the Mueller report, but rather for Barr's misleading public comments about it. The Justice 
Department is silent on this issue. 
Having already trashed Barr's credibility, Judge Walton then turned his fire on Barr's lack of political independence, 
noting that Barr's public "inconsistencies" with the Mueller report -- at a time when the public did not have access to the 
report itself -- "cause the Court to seriously question whether Attorney General Barr made a calculated attempt to 
influence public discourse about the Mueller Report in favor of President Trump..." 
For a former Justice Department prosecutor like myself, this is a jaw-dropper. Not only does a Republican-nominated 
federal judge call out Barr for fudging the truth, but he further questions whether Barr did it to protect the President --
precisely the opposite of what the Justice Department is, and should be, about. 
Judge Walton's scathing decision has led to a humiliating result not just for Barr but for the entire Justice Department. In 
a FOIA lawsuit, a judge typically defers heavily to the Department to make necessary and appropriate redactions to any 
materials before they are released to the public. Here, however, Judge Walton has essentially said: I don't trust you to 
do this honestly, so I'll have to babysit you and review your work first. (Fool me once...) 
A ruling like Judge Walton's would derail the career of any line-level prosecutor. In my 14 years as a federal and state 
prosecutor, neither I nor any of my hundreds of colleagues were ever called out anywhere near so bluntly and forcefully 
by a judge. Judge Walton's powerful words confirm what thousands of former Justice Department prosecutors and 
officials (including me) already firmly believe: Barr is unfit to serve as Attorney General.

Weinstein 
Harvey Weinstein injured in Rikers Island jail, his publicist says 
CNN 
By Chloe Melas and Ralph Ellis 
3/9/2020 
(CNN) — Convicted rapist Harvey Weinstein fell sometime Sunday morning while at Rikers Island jail, his spokesperson 
Juda Englemayer told CNN. 
Englemayer said Weinstein was dizzy before he fell. 
"Harvey says his head throbs all the time and thinks he has a concussion. He has not been officially diagnosed," 
Englemayer said. 
Englemayer, who spoke to Weinstein by phone Sunday evening, says Weinstein has "had a lot of time to think about his 
life and what he's done," adding, "He said he wasn't a nice guy and that's how he got here." 
Movie mogul Weinstein doesn't walk steadily and doesn't have a walker in jail, Englemayer said. During his recent trial, 
Weinstein used a walker to get in and out of court. 
After Weinstein was convicted of sex crimes February 24, paramedics determined he had a heart issue and transported 
him to Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan. 
Weinstein, 67, had a heart procedure last Wednesday during which doctors inserted a stent, Engelmayer told CNN 
recently. He was moved Thursday to the infirmary unit at Rikers Island, New York's main jail complex, Engelmayer said. 
He's expected to be sentenced March 11 in New York State Supreme Court. He faces a minimum of five years and a 
maximum of more than two decades in prison. 
A New York jury convicted Weinstein of committing a criminal sex act in the first degree involving one woman and 
another count of rape in the third degree.

Coronavirus 
SDNY Courthouses Ban Entry To Any Exposed To Coronavirus 
Law360 
By Frank G. Runyeon 
3/9/2020 
Law360, New York (March 9, 2020, 11:10 AM EDT) -- The Southern District of New York on Monday enacted new 
restrictions on who may enter the courts due to the coronavirus outbreak, barring entry to anyone who recently 
traveled to countries that are hardest hit by the virus or those who have come into contact with it. 
In an order, Chief Judge Colleen McMahon said the ban applies to anyone who has traveled to China, South Korea, 
Japan, Italy or Iran in the past 14 days. Also banned are people who live with or have come into close contact with 
anyone who has been in one of those countries during that period; people who have been asked to self-quarantine; and 
those who have either been diagnosed with the virus — called COVID-19 — or come into contact with someone who has 
been diagnosed. 
The order cited guidance by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control that the best way to avoid illness is by avoiding the 
virus altogether. 
"Anyone attempting to enter in violation of these protocols will be denied entry by a court security officer," Judge 
McMahon wrote. She added that the restrictions would "remain in place temporarily until it is determined to be safe to 
remove them."

Again in connection with the Epstein investigation (2018R01618), we'd like to please request permission to travel next 
week for a victim interview in Los Angeles. As of now we tentatively expect to fly down Wednesday and return no later 
than Friday (and will keep the timeframe as short as scheduling allows). The trip will be some combination of me, M, 
and/or 
as previously. And also same as last time, we'd like to ask permission to reserve a conference room at 
the hotel on Thursday for the interview, please.

Again in connection with the Epstein investigation, we'd like to please request permission to travel for approximately 
three days next week for meetings and interviews in West Palm Beach, Florida. As of now we tentatively expect to fly 
down Tuesday night and return on Wednesday or Thursday (and will keep the timeframe as short as scheduling allows). 
Unfortunately we're still trying to pin down timing for interviewing the victims, so depending on the timing it will either 
be me and

I, but we wanted to ask for permission now either way so we weren't doing it

We stamped "Confidential" on every page of the particular production

Court-ordered protective order. Per my conversation with IN just now, I will send • 
a copy of one page of that

Security people have complained in the past that the rubric "confidential" should be reserved for classified

I am including everyone in this email because this situation has the potential to spin further out of control. 
I just received a call from 
the computer security chief at EOUSA. They have been continuing to look at this 
situation. They have been reviewing the documents that were sent and have found documents that are stamped, 
"CONFIDENTIAL". Such a stamping to them indicates the documents might be classified. He also said these documents 
were not redacted and relate to Epstein. I told him they do relate to Epstein. MI instructed me to have the Criminal 
Chief or the AUSA contact the FBI to have them look at the documents and determine if they are classified. He wants this 
done asap so that we can have a call later in the day with him and others, include the General Counsel's Office. He also 
told me to notify the Contracting Officer on the this contract (she is at the Justice Management Division) and notify her of 
a potential classified spill by a contractor. I told him I would do that if it is determined there was a classified spill.

Yes - usually just once something is seized or someone is charged, but each case gets a paralegal for forfeiture support, 
based on unit. For PC it's

Hi all, 
As you may already know, pursuant to the Crime Victims' Rights Act, specifically 18 U.S.C. 3771(a)(4), a crime victim has 
the right to be reasonably heard at certain public proceedings in the district court, including proceedings involving 
release. Accordingly, we wanted to be in touch consistent with our responsibilities and obligations—and your client's 
rights—under that statute, to see whether your client would like to be heard in any fashion, whether through a 
submission, a representation that we can include in our bail submission due Friday, or some other form. Of course no 
requirement or obligation, but we would be happy to discuss it if that would be useful. 
To the extent this information is useful in your consideration, I can say that while I don't want to prejudge the 
Would it make sense to set up a brief call sometime tomorrow, if any of you want to discuss? I should be able to make 
myself available whenever is convenient for you (and likely will be just me, as the remainder of the team will be traveling). 
thank you, 
Assistant U.S. Attorney

In our experience it's rarely a waste of time to talk, and we would be available on Monday morning. And we'll be in the

It is frankly unbelievable to me that BOP is issuing public press releases on this before telling us basic 
information so that we can relay it to his attorneys who can relay it to his family. When can we expect to get 
either some sort of statement we can pass along to counsel as accurate and reliable or have a call with 
someone? 
I understand from the Marshals that they have been unsuccessful in reaching anyone with authority at BOP, 
and given the BOP press release that was just put out I assume we need to speak with someone there. Please 
advise. 
Thank you.

As you might imagine, we are getting increasingly frantic calls from defense counsel who continue to be 
seeing information in the press that we—the U.S. Attorney's Office—haven't yet received. We need to 
know as soon as possible the very basic facts, such as time and cause of death at the absolute minimum. It 
has now been hours since this was reported publicly. Please advise when we can expect to receive either a 
written report on those basic facts or when we can have a call to get that information to relay to his 
counsel. It is extraordinarily frustrating to have to tell them that we have less information than the press. 
Please advise.

I've generally reviewed the PDF file creations and indices and overall I think they look good. A couple notes for the next 
round of materials — most importantly, for any phone bills or invoices, in the index they create, please have them list the 
phone number in the index along with the rest of the description of the file or document (so we can more easily search, 
rather than having to rely on the OCR versions in Relativity). And then second, if in the index they can create a tab that 
contains a column with just the document description (rather than the entire file extension, which it looks like they did for 
these ones). 
For this round, though, it looks good, and we'll have our paralegals make those changes for these docs. Accordingly, these 
records can be uploaded into Relativity under the general folder "Florida investigation FOIA files". (Due to the events of 
this weekend we no longer have active discovery obligations, but we will be reviewing the documents in connection with 
the ongoing investigation.) Your door was locked so I put the envelope with the flash drive right outside your office. 
The next round of materials is the set of discs we've been discussing over the past several days. Unfortunately for us, 
there's likely to be a lot of overlap in this round of materials and the previous documents, because in theory they all come 
from the same place, but we want to process all of them to make sure we're ultimately meeting any and all obligations. In 
EFTA00014355
--- PAGE 2 ---
terms of the vendor, this newer set of docs should be easier because they should be already broken up into component 
parts, but as discussed we'd like them to double-check that — and also to do the same type of index creation as in the last 
round. 
Please let us know if any other questions or issues, let me know if I'm forgetting anything, and thanks as always.

Subject: RE: Richardson 
Hey I spoke to 
and 
about this, but just to keep everyone in the loop, I did talk to Jeff on Sunday and did 
(what I thought was) a fairly standard witness / subject / target distinction, noting we didn't have sufficient information to 
put him into the witness or target boxes, and that we didn't currently intend to subpoena him or request to speak with 
him based on the investigation at this time. So I didn't specifically say he was a subject, but I noted the three categories 
and said we didn't have enough information for witness or target. I also said that there weren't specific allegations that 
we need to hear his side of at this time, and I think my intended point was conveyed, which was that we weren't currently 
asking for anything from him—not that there are no allegations at all, which obviously there are, publicly. I did not say 
that there is no allegation that the government is actively investigating; I just would never say to an attorney what we are 
or aren't investigating. In any event, my contemporaneous notes are attached, I typed and sent them less than ten 
minutes after our conversation, which lasted all of four minutes. I'm really sorry for any difficulties this causes us. 
After talking with 
about it, I also just spoke to Jeff and expressed my view that the statement does not fully 
accurately reflect our conversation, and that our press office could respond to questions about it or he could clarify, and 
he said he would get back to me with how he proposed to address the discrepancies.

--- PAGE 2 ---
Governor Bill Richardson offered his assistance in the Jeffrey Epstein investigation - through his lawyer, Jeff Brown of 
Dechert LLP - to the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York. In response to this offer, Mr. Brown was informed 
by the Assistant US Attorney responsible for the case that Governor Richardson is neither a target, subject, nor witness in 
the case and that there is no allegation against Governor Richardson that the government is actively investigating. 
"It's fair to conclude that the federal prosecutors investigating this matter do not believe the Governor participated in or 
witnessed the criminal activity Jeffrey Epstein is alleged to have committed," said Mr. Brown. 
Governor Richardson hopes that the investigation continues so that Epstein's victims can finally have their day in court 
and see the justice they deserve.

- calling in connection with 
allegation / testimony released in the civil papers 
- deposition says, in sum and substance, was ordered to, but doesn't appear to say that anything actually happened 
- counsel asked what category Richardson is in w/r/t our investigation — witness / subject/ target 
o I advised that in the general sense, anyone who we don't have reason to know has no exposure (witness), or 
believe does have exposure (target), would be a subject; more specifically here, we do not currently 
intend to subpoena or request to speak with Richardson based on our investigation at this time, and there 
are not specific allegations that we need to hear his side of at this time. 
o I further advised that it would be helpful to get an attorney proffer about any knowledge or information 
pertaining to Epstein that Richardson might have; counsel said he believed that would be possible to do 
but he expected client would not have any knowledge regarding the charged conduct 
- I advised that if in the course of our investigation we did want to speak with Richardson, or inquire for additional 
information, we would be in touch with counsel

I hope you're both well! I just wanted to follow up with you both, as I hadn't received an answer from 
yet and 
wanted to make sure the drives (below) were dealt with today if they're time-sensitive. I received both drives today in the

I wanted to let you know that the vendor has finished the stamping of part 5 of the production. Parts 1— 3 have been 
exported from Relativity. The vendor will start the stamping of part 6 of the production shortly. 
The vendor has also been able to load the data for the USAO-SDFL files into the other Epstein database:

Looking on Relativity, it appears that part 4 is at least stamped now, which puts us more 
than halfway through the stamping. We are planning to ask Judge Nathan for an extension, but given how quickly the 
stamping and export appeared to go today, I am hopeful that this may be ready sooner than the November 19th date 
we've been discussing.

Hello, 
The vendor had to break up the production into seven parts. As of right now the vendor has finished parts 1— 3 and is 
about to start on the stamping of documents for part 4. The vendor has exported part one to the hard drive and is 
currently working on exporting part to two the hard drive right now. Part three just finished about 10 minutes ago and 
the export has not started yet. You can review the productions by going to the following searches:

Thank you for this lovely and heartfelt note. It has been a pleasure working with you on some of the Office's 
most important cases, which would not have been possible without your tenacity and intelligence. I hope I am 
able to see you before too long.

I very much look forward to a time when I can say this to you in person, but in the interim, thank you so, so much for 
having the fortitude and courage to stand up for what is right for the interests of justice and the Office, both over the 
course of years and especially in recent days. It obviously is no exaggeration to say that you have made the difference 
between continuity and consistent principled leadership at SDNY and an entirely unknown alternative. It is truly 
extraordinary. 
More generally, although I'm dismayed that you won't be physically present for the charging and resolution of so many 
cases you've put your heart and soul into, I am immensely grateful to have worked for you and we are all determined to 
see through the cases that have been built during your tenure. And in particular, I'm personally so grateful for your 
support, encouragement, and input on the Epstein case. A different U.S. Attorney might very well have said was too 
difficult to pursue, or too aggressive to charge, or too old to relitigate — and instead, you have been with us every step of 
the way. Even in challenging moments, when we all felt the immense pressure of the circumstances, it was always clear 
that you were focused on the interests of justice and the interests of the victims. In a case that was incredibly tough but 
even more rewarding, I hope you will take great pride in what the Office accomplished — and what we will continue to 
attempt to achieve going forward. 
And with all our cases, you always prioritized the most important parts of our work and upheld the best traditions of the 
Office. On a personal note, I remember meeting you in the very first day or two you were on the job, when you walked 
around the 8th floor on a weekend, introducing yourself and your family and wanting to connect with the AUSAs right 
away. And you were the exact same up until what ended up being some of the last days, walking around on 8, checking 
in on the people who came in for the first day of the readiness phase, and talking about the importance of integrating 
people who wouldn't be able to be physically present for a while. Very fitting bookends. 
I look forward to reunions for many years to come, I hope you and your family stay well given all the current 
circumstances, and thank you very much for your leadership.

I just wanted to briefly add to what I know is an outpouring of support, both within and outside our Office — yesterday's 
events were unconscionable, and not least because of, and perhaps prompted by, your steadfast integrity and 
leadership. You have consistently supported and upheld the highest standards of the Office, both substantively for our 
work and also in terms of our processes and morale (I can't believe it was just Tuesday that we talking about how 
thorough and effective the SDNY approach has been to COVID). Thank you for standing up for what is right, and for your 
leadership now and in the future.

Team, just as an FYI, no obligation at all for anybody else to do this, but I switched my L.A. hotel to a different spot for 
our upcoming visit — at least through our booking systems, the DoubleTree in Santa Monica during that time is over our 
allowable daily price for whatever reason — but even more importantly, last time we were there the front desk told me 
that construction there was going to be a complete nightmare from January through at least March (i.e., all the drilling 
from last time, but much worse). And I didn't see any other normal / decent business hotels in that area that were 
within our per diem (with the possible exception of the Le Meridien). 
However, for the first time in any of the trips we've ever been out there, the Beverly Hilton is listed within our per diem 
($181 for the AUSAs), and it's less than a ten minute drive from both 
attorney's office and 
attorney's 
office (and we could of course get a conference room there for 
). It's not the fanciest hotel in the world, but it's a 
normal Hilton, the location is perfect, and no drilling (I), so I went for it and wanted to recommend it and let everybody 
know. No worries if people prefer elsewhere, but it's an option.

just FYI, in connection with this trip to Los Angeles, I just made a reservation for a hotel on E2 (see attached) —
if I did anything wrong, it can be changed, but it's a hotel that is almost never available for us so I wanted to make the 
reservation tonight just in case. And will follow up with flights in the coming days. Happy to chat if that's useful, and 
thanks very much.

Thanks for circling back, and we'll do our best to answer these questions. In terms of who would be in the room, the 
most likely answer is that it would be two of the prosecutors and the two law enforcement officers on the case. The 
only reason I saw "most likely" rather than having a definitive answer is that when we're interviewing in a foreign 
country, it sometimes is the case the local law enforcement also insists on having representatives present. I don't 
believe that's required in the U.K., but we can check on it and give you a definitive answer in the coming days if that's 
useful. (Also, if she preferred to be interviewed in the U.S., we certainly could guarantee that the room would be just 
the case team, and we could arrange for travel and lodging for her. Let us know if that's the case, but otherwise we're of 
course happy to travel to her.) 
Regarding access to notes, it would principally be the investigative team—so again, the prosecutors and the FBI team 
working on the case. Our respective supervisors also theoretically have access to our files, but the reports are not 
generally widely disseminated. The basic logistics are that an agent takes notes during an interview, and then types up 
those notes into a formal report (called an FBI Form 302). We don't ordinarily share notes with other entities, but I can 
also check on that to see if I can make a more specific representation with respect to your client. 
With respect to anonymity, I confess that I'm not familiar with the distinction you're referring to. In terms of our 
investigation, we don't publicly disclose the names of individuals we meet with, and we don't disclose to any other 
witnesses, for example, the identities of victims or witnesses we are meeting with. (And our policies on that don't 
change even for individuals who are in the position of your client, who have been widely publicly reported to have been 
connected to Epstein and/or his employees or associates). But if that doesn't answer your question, we're of course 
happy to discuss further. Let me know if it might be useful to have a call? Or if not, also happy to address any follow-up 
via email.

Hi 
Thanks for this. I've been asked who would be in the room and thereafter who would have access to any notes 
made. Would her permission be sought before disclosing to any other parties or officials? 
As you know there is a real difficulty in relation to her anonymity in the US versus the UK. Are you able to 
provide any comfort on this?

Thank you again for speaking with us earlier today regarding our interest in talking with your client in connection with 
our investigation into the conduct of Jeffrey Epstein. 
As requested, we wanted to briefly memorialize our current views and understandings of your client, and also to 
reiterate our interest in approaching any discussion with great care and sensitivity, particularly to avoid adding to her 
trauma or causing re-victimization. 
As we mentioned on the phone, your client is not a target of our investigation—it sounds like the analogue in the U.K. 
may be the "suspect" category—and we currently do not have reason to believe that she has committed any U.S. 
federal crime. As we discussed, our knowledge of your client specifically is somewhat limited, having never spoken to 
her—and therefore knowing about her only through other witnesses and records—but it certainly has been our 
experience that the overwhelming majority of young women and girls who were in the orbit of Jeffrey Epstein during 
the relevant periods were subject to his abuse. It does not surprise us, nor do we have any trouble believing, that your 
client was similarly a victim. I hope that is helpful in understanding the capacity in which we hope to speak with her. 
Separately, and as we also discussed, any discussion with our team would be entirely voluntary—and that extends not 
just to whether she would be willing to meet with us at all, but also including her ability to decline to discuss particular 
topics or even particular questions, and to talk with her counsel at any time, to take any breaks that would be 
beneficial while we're meeting, etc. 
In terms of topic areas, we would be hoping to learn about the general narrative of her interactions with Epstein and 
his other associates and employees, including Ghislaine Maxwell, whom we understand she may have worked directly 
for. That would broadly include how she came to be in contact with them, the nature and scope of her employment, 
any instructions she was given relating to other women or girls, and just generally her experiences and observations in 
interacting with them. We ordinarily would also be interested in understanding the general nature of the abuse she 
was subjected to, but I want to emphasize that we would not need to discuss with her the specifics if she weren't 
comfortable with that, and in particular we often don't even broach that subject in a first meeting. 
Please let us know if you have any additional questions, and in particular whether any other information from us 
would be useful, and we look forward to speaking with you again soon. 
Regards,

Apologies for the slight delay yesterday on this travel, we had a witness scheduling issue so the travel will be a day later 
than originally anticipated. The city is Pensacola, Florida, and it will be me and 
(rather than 
and 
if you could please book me on the following flights: 
Feb. 19: Delta, LGA to PNS, 9:00 a.m. (arriving 12:49 p.m.) 
Feb. 20: Delta, PNS to LGA, 4:06 p.m. (arriving 9:41 p.m.) 
And the following hotel, for the night of Feb. 19: 
- 
Hilton Garden Inn (listed in E2 as "HGI PENSACOLA AIRPORT MEDICAL") 
We will also need a conference room at the Hilton Garden Inn for February 19, starting at 5:00 p.m. for three hours (or 
for the entire day, if that's the only way they'll do it). 
Please let us know if any questions or issues, and thanks as always.

Also based on our discussion earlier we'll be mindful of looking for domestic (or domestic-flagged) carrier flights, as

three days next week for meetings and interviews in West Palm Beach, Florida. As of now we tentatively expect to

just FYI, in connection with this trip to Los Angeles, I just made a reservation for a hotel on E2 (see attached) — if I 
did anything wrong, it can be changed, but it's a hotel that is almost never available for us so I wanted to make the 
reservation tonight just in case. And will follow up with flights in the coming days. Happy to chat if that's useful, and

In an effort to reduce the number of things we'll have to scramble to do whenever the arrest occurs, there are a couple 
new saved does in the share for whichever one of us ends up handling particular random things — in the Grand Jury/ 
Indictment materials folder is an unsealing request and proposed order, since we'll want to do that immediately upon 
arrest. 
Also, I created a new "Victim notification" folder and added a draft of what I think we should put up on a victim 
notification page on our website (like ), 
which we can add updates to as the case goes along. 
can put that up 
when it's time. 
Neither is any rush at the moment, obviously, but they're attached in case anybody wants to take a look and have any 
comments / corrections / edits so they're ready to go when necessary. And if either of you can think of anything else we 
should be doing now to save ourselves a few minutes down the road, say the word I Thx.

Re: 
Request for Information Relating to Jeffrey Epstein 
Dear Mr. Glassman: 
I write in response to your letter dated June 8, 2020, seeking documents from the 
Department of Justice ("DOJ") related to Jeffrey Epstein and plaintiff Jane Doe in Jane Doe v. 
Indyke et at, No. 20-cv-484 (S.D.N.Y.). Because your request seeks information from 
Department of Justice (the "Department") employees acquired during and as part of their 
performance of their official duties, your request is governed by certain Department 
regulations—commonly referred to as Told°, regulations—which, inter alia, prohibit any 
Department employee from disclosing such information "without prior approval of the proper 
Department official in accordance with §§ 16.24 and 16.25 of this part." 28 C.F.R. § 16.22(a); 
see also United States ex reL Told°, v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951); 28 C.F.R. § 16.21 et seq. 
The "proper official" in this case is Audrey Strauss, the Acting United States Attorney for the 
Southern District of New York. 
The applicable Touhy regulations direct the Department to consider inter alia, "[w]hether 
... disclosure is appropriate under the rules of procedure governing the case or matter in which 
the demand arose." 28 C.F.R. § 16.26(a)(1). The Department understands that there is an initial 
pretrial conference scheduled for August 5, 2020, in Doe v. Indyke and that the parties in that 
matter have already exchanged discovery demands and responses. See Scheduling Order dated 
July 21, 2020, ECF No. 57, Doe v. Indyke et aL, No. 20-cv-484 (S.D.N.Y.). In light of the 
potential for formal discovery demands to issue in connection with Doe v. hidyke, the 
Department has determined that disclosures in response to your pending request are appropriate 
at this time and in lieu of any formal discovery request. 
The applicable Touhy regulations forbid, inter alia, "[d]isclosure [which] would violate a 
statute . . . or a rule of procedure, such as the grand jury secrecy rule," 28 U.S.C. § 16.26(b)(1). 
Accordingly, the Department cannot provide any documents in its possession governed by the

Acosta Defends Epstein Plea At Labor Committee Hearing 
By kin Gurrieri 
https://www.law360.com/articles/1153080/acosta-
defends-e stein-plea-at-labor-committee-hearing
Share us on: 
Law360 (May I, 2019, 6:35 PM EDT) -- U.S. 
Secretary of Labor Alex Acosta forcefully pushed 
back Wednesday as Democratic lawmakers voiced 
concerns that his alleged mishandling of a decade-old 
sex crime case against millionaire Jeffrey Epstein 
meant he might also let employers off easy for 
workplace law violations. 
At a wide-ranging hearing before the House 
Committee on Education and Labor, lawmakers 
quizzed Acosta on a variety of issues facing the U.S. 
Department of Labor, ranging from the agency's 
budget to regulatory initiatives and enforcement 
priorities. But one area where Acosta received 
strident criticism was over a nonprosecution deal he 
struck with Epstein in a teen sex trafficking case 
when he was the U.S. attorney for the Southern 
District of Florida about a decade before he became 
labor secretary. 
U.S. District Judge Kenneth A. Marra found in 
February that Acosta and other prosecutors had 
misled Epstein's victims about the existence of the 
nonprosecution agreement, thereby violating their 
right to be informed under the Crime Victims' Rights 
Act. That decision came several months after The 
Miami Herald published an investigative series that 
said Acosta gave Epstein the deal in exchange for a 
guilty plea to lesser state charges. The unusually 
EFTA00014454
--- PAGE 2 ---
lenient agreement called off potential federal charges 
not only against Epstein but also against alleged co-
conspirators. 
Democratic Rep. Frederica Wilson of Florida 
expressed concern during Wednesday's hearing that 
Acosta's alleged mishandling of the Epstein case was 
an indication that he won't adequately protect 
workers' interests over those of industry. 
But that assertion drew a sharp rebuke from Acosta, 
who said the U.S. Department of Justice has long 
taken the position that the Crime Victims' Rights Act 
wasn't violated in the Epstein case. 
"I understand that the judge disagreed with the 
[DOJ's] position, but we acted consistent with DOJ 
protocol, rules and regulations and that's the position 
of the department based on my understanding of the 
litigation," Acosta said, adding that the DOJ's 
position hasn't changed across different 
administrations and attorneys general. 
"This matter was appealed all the way up to the 
deputy attorney general's office, and not because we 
weren't doing enough, but because the contention was 
that we were too aggressive," Acosta added. 
Besides the Epstein case, Acosta also fielded pointed 
questions from committee Democrats on various 
recent regulatory initiatives by the DOL, with most 
of the queries focusing on the Labor 
Department's recent proposal to overhaul its white-
collar overtime exemption regulations. 
The proposed regulation would update the Fair Labor 
Standards Act's overtime exemptions for executive, 
administrative and professional, or EAP, workers, 
replacing a previous version issued by the Obama 
administration. 
EFTA00014455
--- PAGE 3 ---
If it is finalized without major changes, the rule will 
hike the DOL's salary threshold for white collar 
workers to qualify for one of the EAP exemptions to 
$35,308 per year or $679 per week — up from the 
$23,660 annual salary that was set when the rule was 
last updated in 2004, but lower than the $47,000 
cutoff the Obama administration had proposed in 
2016. 
Rep. Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, the top 
Republican on the committee, expressed concern that 
the Obama-era overtime regulation is still pending at 
the Fifth Circuit and could conceivably be revived 
before the DOL is done with the current rulemaking 
process to replace it. 
Acosta, however, sidestepped her request for 
"assurances" that the proposed replacement rule 
would be finalized "in a timely manner," with the 
labor secretary simply reiterating that the proposed 
regulation has been issued and the public notice-and-
comment period is ongoing. 
In response to a question on the overtime rule from 
Democratic Rep. Mark Takano of California, Acosta 
defended the DOL's decision to appeal a ruling that 
blocked the Obama administration's version of the 
rule — the same one the DOL is currently trying to 
replace — to protect the agency's ability to issue such 
a rule at all. 
"I think it's important when these rules are called into 
question, the U.S. government should defend them 
where appropriate," Acosta told Takano. "We can 
disagree with the policy underlying the rule and we 
can still appeal the rule." 
In a notable regulatory tidbit, Acosta divulged to 
lawmakers that the agency is working with the U.S. 
EFTA00014456
--- PAGE 4 ---
Securities and Exchange Commission on a new 
fiduciary rule. 
An Obama-era version of the rule issued by the DOL 
requiring retirement advisers to put their clients' 
interests before their own when selling retirement 
investments was struck down by the courts. 
"Based on our collaborative work we will be issuing 
new rules in this area," Acosta said, but declined to 
offer a time frame for when any such rules might be 
issued. 
Acosta also addressed several other hot-button 
employment topics during the hearing. He weighed in 
on the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark decision last 
year in Janus v. AFSCME 2., which deemed it 
unconstitutional for public-sector unions to collect 
so-called agency fees from nonunion workers that 
cover the costs associated with collective bargaining 
without their explicit consent. 
The labor secretary told lawmakers he believes Janus 
was a "correct and appropriate" decision, and that the 
DOL is enforcing the law in the wake of Janus "to the 
extent that it comes within our authority." 
Acosta also responded to a question about the 
minimum wage from the Education and Labor 
Committee chairman, Democratic Rep. Bobby Scott 
of Virginia, by saying the Trump administration 
doesn't "support a change to the federal minimum 
wage at this time."

US: Once-secret Jeffrey Epstein 
sex offender deal must stand 
By Curt Anderson I AP 
June 25 at 10:23 AM 
MIAMI — Federal prosecutors say a once-secret plea deal reached over a decade 
ago with wealthy convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein must stand, despite 
objections from many of his victims. 
Prosecutors said in a new court filing that a violation of the Crime Victims' Rights 
Act does not allow for the agreement to be voided. 
Some of the victims claim it should be thrown out at least partially, because they 
were not consulted as required. 
Now it's up to a federal judge to decide what to do. 
The 2008 deal ended a federal investigation. It allowed Epstein to plead guilty to 
lesser state charges that resulted in a 13-month jail sentence. It also required 
financial settlements to dozens of his once-teenage victims and that he register as 
a sex offender.

Yeah we're one step ahead -- the Marius Fortelni who lives in Southampton says on his website that he lived for a 
time in Saudi Arabia, so given his nationality, the fact that the "residence" on the passport is Saudi Arabia, and 
the fact that the age roughly appears to match up, we asked the agents to try to confirm the DOB but also to just 
reach out to Mr. Fortelni and see if he has any knowledge of why a passport from his country, with his name and 
former residence country, might be in Jeffrey Epstein's safe and with Jeffrey Epstein's face on it.

Hi 
M
,
Hope you're doing well! I'm a reporter with The Daily Beast and have been covering Jeffrey Epstein. 
Today, attorneys for Mr. Epstein's victims said Mr. Epstein sexually abused a young woman while he was out on work 
release in 2008-09. 
Here is our story. Would love to get your insight: haps://www.thedailybeast com effrey-epstein-abused-victims-while-
serving-time-in-florida-lawyer-brad-edwards-says
Would you be able to comment on this? Did SDNY hear any complaints about Mr. Epstein's activities while on work 
release? Could this perhaps factor into the case—especially as Mr. Epstein's legal team is trying to get him out on bail? 
Alternately, could you provide any comment on background? 
Please drop me a line or give me a call. My cell is

Filing our letter now. Here's their passport explanation, from the defense filing: 
Eighth, as for the Austrian passport the government trumpets, it expired 32 years 
ago. And the government offers nothing to suggest — and certainly no evidence —
that Epstein ever used it. In any case, Epstein — an affluent member of the Jewish 
faith — acquired the passport in the 1980s, when hijackings were prevalent, in 
connection to Middle East travel. The passport was for personal protection in the 
event of travel to dangerous areas, only to be presented to potential kidnapers, 
hijackers or terrorists should violent episodes occur.

FYI all, this was sent from chambers to defense counsel a short while ago. The relevant provision of their letter reads: 
Fifth, in response to the Court's inquiry about Epstein's New Mexico registration status, the 
state's Public Safety Department formally advised in August 2010 that "you are not required to 
register with the State of New Mexico ... for your 2008 Florida conviction of Procuring Person 
Under 18 for Prostitution." Nonetheless, in an abundance of caution and as an extra precaution, 
Epstein consistently notified the appropriate New Mexico official, Detective 
when he spent any time at his residence there. (The underlying documents are available upon 
request.) 
Perhaps the issue of bail turns entirely upon whether the defendant notified New Mexico when he was in the state!

Re: US v. Epstein, 19 CR 490 (SDNY) 
Dear Judge Berman: 
In response to requests from the Court and certain arguments made 
yesterday by the government, we write to supplement Jeffrey Epstein's 
request for bail. 
First, make no mistake about the crux of the government's 
detention argument and its necessary implications. Stripped to its core, 
the government's position — as urged in its letters and echoed again 
yesterday — distills to this: the nominally rebuttable remand 
presumption (connected with 18 USC § 1591 charges) 1 plus Mr. 
To be clear, Epstein contends that § 1591 and the concomitant remand presumption 
do not contemplate or cover the core conduct at issue here: performing sexual

Page 2 
Epstein's wealth creates an irrebuttable presumption whereby no 
condition(s) can reasonably assure personal appearance or protect the 
public. The Court should reject the government's misguided effort to 
effectively create a per se rule. 2 Indeed, for the government, there's 
literally nothing a person of Epstein's means could say, do or pledge to 
rebut the operative presumption and make himself eligible for release. 
That cannot be the law. Such a construction turns the statute's 
massages for money. See Fierro u. Taylor, No. 11-CV8573, 2012 WL 13042630, at *3 
(SDNY July 2, 2012) (holding that sex purchasers from minors fall outside § 1591's 
ambit). 
E.g., 7/15/19 Tr. 11 ("even if the defense were able at some point to rebut the 
presumption by providing some more information, there simply is no way that they 
can meet the standard here"); 7/12/19 Ltr. 5 ("even assuming the defendant's assets 
are presently in the United States, nothing ... would prevent the defendant from 
transferring liquid assets out of the country quickly and in anticipation of flight or 
relocation. The defendant is an incredibly sophisticated financial actor with decades 
of experience in the industry and significant ties to financial institutions and actors 
around the world. He could easily transfer funds and holdings on a moment's [notice] 
to places where the [g]overnment would never find them so as to ensure he could live 
comfortably while a fugitive."); id. ("even were the defendant to sacrifice literally all 
of his current assets, there is every indication that he would immediately be able to 
resume making ... tens of millions of dollars per year outside of the United States.... 
[T]here would be little to stop the defendant from fleeing, transferring his unknown 
assets abroad, and then continuing to ... earn his vast wealth from a computer 
terminal beyond the reach of extradition.") (footnote omitted); id. 7 ("the notion that 
any individual co-signer could meaningfully secure a bond for this defendant strains 
credulity").

Page 3 
plain text — expressly providing that the presumption is "[s]ubject to 
rebuttal," and otherwise mandating bail on the "least restrictive" 
conditions that reasonably assure the defendant's presence and 
community safety — on its head. It defies legislative intent. It thwarts the 
presumption of innocence. And it violates the Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth 
amendment rights to due process, counsel, a defense and equal 
protection, not to mention the Eighth Amendment guarantee of bail — all 
based on a suspect if not invidious classification. To be sure, wealthy 
defendants do not deserve preferential treatment. But they certainly 
shouldn't be singled out for worse treatment — in effect, categorically 
disqualified from bail, at least in a presumption case — on the basis of 
their net worth. 
Second, it bears emphasis that the presumption is hardly an 
insurmountable bar to release in a § 1591 prosecution.3 To the contrary, 
courts have determined that there are suitable conditions under which

defendants accused of trafficking minors are bailed — notwithstanding 
the remand presumption. 
Third, as apparent from Mr. Epstein's initial financial disclosure, 
Mr. Epstein's finances are fairly complex. It would be impossible for Mr. 
Epstein — given, among other impediments, his detention, inability to 
quickly access pertinent records, and inability to quickly make a precise 
valuation of particular assets — to provide a sufficient financial statement 
by the Court's 5pm deadline. Mr. Epstein certainly recognizes the Court's 
request for further transparency and is committed to providing a 
complete and accurate disclosure. Accordingly, we propose that the Court 
preliminarily accept the initial disclosure proffered last Friday and, if 
intending to grant bail, include a release condition directing Mr. Epstein 
to tender a comprehensive forensic accounting of his finances as 
expeditiously as practicable. Joel Podgor, Partner Emeritus at prominent 
Manhattan accounting firm Baker Tilly Virchow Krause, LLP, has 
agreed to conduct the forensic investigation and prepare a report rapidly. 
As counsel said during the July 15 argument, Epstein will agree to any

monetary condition — consistent with his Sixth Amendment need to 
retain counsel and pay ordinary expenses, which, at the Court's 
discretion, could be subject to supervision by a Court-appointed trustee — 
that collateralizes his assets as a condition of release. 
Fourth, to the extent the government complains Epstein lacks 
meaningful domestic ties, we clarify and emphasize that his brother 
Mark, a U.S. resident, stands prepared to co-sign and secure a release 
bond in the full amount of his "own net worth,"4 which exceeds $100 
million — tangible proof of his certainty that Epstein will appear as 
necessary. 
Fifth, in response to the Court's inquiry about Epstein's New 
Mexico registration status, the state's Public Safety Department formally 
advised in August 2010 that "you are not required to register with the 
State of New Mexico ... for your 2008 Florida conviction of Procuring 
Person Under 18 for Prostitution." Nonetheless, in an abundance of 
caution and as an extra precaution, Epstein consistently notified the

spent any time at his ranch there. (The underlying documents are 
available upon request.) 
Sixth, though some studies may well indicate that sex offender 
recidivism rates "actually gofl up at 15 years," as Your Honor suggested 
from the bench,5 others reach the opposite conclusion. For example, a 
respected study found that the relapse risk drops substantially the longer 
a person remains sex-offense free in the community. 6 Another 
determined that it's mistaken to think of anyone who's been offense-free 
for 15 years as high-risk.?

is wrong. As explained in Court, the recipients were "long-time [Epstein] 
friends and employees" 10 — not putative victims — and they never 
cooperated with Mr. Boies. To the contrary, each invoked the Fifth 
Amendment and refused to testify when civilly deposed, respectively, in 
prior New York federal and Florida state civil proceedings. Subject to the 
protective orders in these proceedings, we would be pleased to provide 
relevant deposition transcripts. 
Eighth, as for the Austrian passport the government trumpets, it 
expired 32 years ago. And the government offers nothing to suggest — and 
certainly no evidence — that Epstein ever used it. In any case, Epstein — 
an affluent member of the Jewish faith — acquired the passport in the

travel. The passport was for personal protection in the event of travel to

or terrorists should violent episodes occur. 
Ninth, the Court is undoubtedly aware of the highly charged 
context surrounding this prosecution. In November 2018, media reports 
suggested that Epstein received a plea deal that amounted to a "slap on 
the wrist." Putting aside the robust negotiations leading to the non-
prosecution agreement (NPA) and the prison sentence that Epstein 
completed, there can be no dispute that certain witnesses through their 
attorney representatives,11 the media — e.g., The Miami Herald — and 
the public were all clamoring for his re-prosecution, Epstein traveled 
extensively over these eight months and invariably returned to the 
United States. That inescapable reality emphatically proves he won't flee 
and entitles him to release — on any and all conditions the Court deems 
appropriate. 
See, e.g., Doe u. US, CV 807-36 (SD Fla.).

UNDER SEAL 
Re: 
United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 (RMB) 
Dear Judge Berman: 
The Government respectfully submits this letter to provide the Court with additional 
information in response to the Court's questions at the detention hearing held on July 15, 2019 
(the "Detention Hearing"). 
I. Payments to Potential Witnesses' 
In a July 12, 2019 letter, the Government informed the Court that the Government had 
recently obtained records from a financial institution ("Institution-1") that appeared to show the 
defendant had made suspicious payments shortly after the Miami Herald began publishing, on 
approximately November 28, 2018, a series of articles relating to the defendant, his alleged sexual 
misconduct, and the circumstances under which he entered into a non-prosecution agreement 
("NPA") with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida in 2007. The same 
series highlighted the involvement of several of Epstein's former employees and associates in the 
alleged sexual abuse. At the Detention Hearing, the Court asked the Government to provide 
additional information about the individuals to whom these payments appear to have been made. 
First, records from Institution-1 show that on or about November 30, 2018, or two days 
after the series in the Miami Herald began, the defendant wired $100,000 from a trust account he 
controlled to 
, an individual named as 
a potential co-conspirator—and for whom Epstein obtained protection in—the NPA. This 
individual was also named and featured prominently in the Herald series. 
Second, the same records show that just three days later, on or about December 3, 2018, 
the defendant wired $250,000 from the same trust account to 
, who was 
For the reasons set forth at the Detention Hearing, and with the consent of the Court, the 
Government is redacting the identities of these individuals in the publicly filed version of this 
letter.

also named as a potential co-conspirator—and for whom Epstein also obtained protection in—the 
NPA. This individual is also one of the employees identified in the Indictment, which alleges that 
she and two other identified employees facilitated the defendant's trafficking of minors by, among 
other things, contacting victims and scheduling their sexual encounters with the defendant at his 
residences in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Florida. This individual was also named and featured 
prominently in the Herald series. 
II. Police Report 
During the Detention Hearing, the parties referenced a redacted copy of a Palm Beach 
police report, which was annexed to the Government's July 12, 2019 detention memorandum. At 
the Court's request, the Government has provided a supplemental copy of the police report 
previously filed, with information referred to in open court unredacted. The updated copy of the 
police report is attached as Exhibit A. 
III. Foreign Passport 
During the Detention Hearing, the Government informed the Court that it had recently 
learned that law enforcement agents had seized what appears to be an expired foreign passport (the 
"Foreign Passport") from a safe in the defendant's Manhattan residence during the execution of a 
search warrant on or about July 6, 2019. The Foreign Passport has a photograph that appears to 
depict the defendant, but lists a different name. Photographs of that passport are annexed hereto 
as Exhibit B. In the same safe, agents discovered what appears to be an expired United States 
passport issued to the defendant, in his true name, within three years of the date on the Foreign 
Passport. A photograph of that United States passport is annexed hereto as Exhibit C, so that the 
Court may compare the passports, both of which appear to depict the defendant. Because Exhibits 
B and C contain personally identifiable information and sensitive information relevant to the 
ongoing investigation, the Government respectfully requests that Exhibits B and C be filed under 
seal. 
The Government is attempting to obtain additional information about the Foreign Passport, 
including how it was obtained and whether the passport is genuine or fabricated. But the 
defendant's possession of what purports to be a foreign passport issued under an alias gives rise to 
the inference the defendant knows how to obtain false travel documents and/or assume other, 
foreign identities. This adds to the serious risk of flight posed by the defendant.' 
The Government has asked defense counsel to advise whether the defendant is currently, or has 
been in the past, a citizen or legal permanent resident of a country other than the United States. To 
date, defense counsel has declined to respond. Certainly if the defendant is, or has been, a citizen 
or permanent resident of another country, that would add significantly to the overwhelming 
evidence of risk of flight.

IV. Cash and Diamonds 
At the Detention Hearing, the Government informed the Court that diamonds and cash 
were seized from a safe in the defendant's Manhattan residence. The Court inquired as to the value 
of these items. After conferring with law enforcement agents who have reviewed the materials 
from the safe, the Government has learned that the safe contained more than $70,000 in cash. In 
addition, the safe contained 48 loose diamond stones, ranging in size from approximately 1 carat 
to 2.38 carats, as well as a large diamond ring. The Government is currently unaware of whether 
the defendant maintains similar stashes of cash and/or jewels at his multiple properties, or in other 
locations. Such ready cash and loose diamonds are consistent with the capability to leave the 
jurisdiction at a moment's notice. 
V. Conclusion 
For the reasons set forth herein, in the Government's July 8, 2019 and July 12, 2019 
detention memoranda, and on the record at the Detention Hearing, the Court should order that the 
defendant be detained pending trial. The defendant cannot meet his burden of overcoming the 
presumption that there is no combination of conditions that would reasonably assure his continued 
appearance in this case or protect the safety of the community were he to be released.

With apologies for the bother, and understanding that we've been in the midst of holidays, do you have a sense of when 
we might be able to receive the list of clients represented MI 
you / BSF currently represent? We're in the process of 
planning a possible trip to Florida potentially as early as the beginning of next week and we think a meeting would be 
most productive if we can do some groundwork on relevant individuals in advance, ideally today or tomorrow if at all 
possible. Similarly, if we're able to get the confidentiality / protective order this week, we can consider what steps we can 
take in the coming days regarding those issues as well. 
If it would be helpful for us to do a call with 
to make the requests directly, or to talk through any issues, we are also 
very happy to do that, that's no problem at all. And if we are able to get that information this week, and we can get 
permission and funding to travel next week, we can set up a meeting with him as well. We're on the starters blocks here 
and very ready to start running (again, fully recognizing that the past couple weeks have been holidays and vacation time 
for most folks). 
thanks again,

Thanks very much, this is helpful, and in terms of follow up, the absolute most helpful thing for us at this stage — and this 
may be forthcoming, but just wanted to reiterate — would be to have a list of the names of the victims currently 
represented by you / BSF /=. 
If that needs to wait until 
is back from vacation, that's no problem at all, but it 
would just be, I think, the names of the plaintiffs in the VRA lawsuit (unless there are other civil suit clients separate from 
that case and in addition to the two SDNY cases we've already discussed).

Subject: Requested Info 
In further reply to your asks, here is some information that may be of help: 
1. MI has a list of all known victims of JE who were victims during the period of his trafficking in Florida. 
also 
knows the names of the lawyers who represent the girls. You have a number of lawyers' names from yesterday, 
but 
can match them up to specific clients, by names. He said that the USA also has that information—that is, 
attorney names and their client names—so that may be how you prefer to proceed. He said there are 40 names 
attached to the NPA, which I assume you have—or have access to. But MI also has the names of additional girls, 
beyond the 40, and will provide them to you. (He may be the only person who has these additional names. Not 
sure that the USA or the Bureau has them.) 
2. I will be receiving a copy of Judge Sweet's confidentiality order in 
v. Maxwell and will forward it to you when 
I get it. (Vacations this week are slowing things a bit.) 
3. With regard to lawyers who represent, or did at one time, various victims and actors, here are their names as 
recalled by 
from his hammock on a beach with his wife and kids in Costa Rica, mojito (I am guessing) in hand: 
LAWYERS FOR EPSTEIN: ALAN DERSHOWITZ, ROY BLACK. GUY LEWIS. MICHAEL TIEN. MARTY WEINBERG. BOB 
CRITTON. MIKE PIKE. SCOTT LINK. REID WEINGARTEN. GERRY LEFCOURT. JAY LEFKOWITZ. KEN STARR. CHET 
BREWER. JACK GOLDBERGER. FRED HADDAD. TONJA HADDAD. LIKLY SANCHEZ. JOE ACKERMAN. CHRIS KNIGHT. 
MICHAEL MILLER. JUSTIN CHU. THERE WERE A COUPLE MORE INSIGNIFICANT ONES. 
LAWYERS FOR PILOTS, JE HOUSE STAFF, AND 
- All represented by BRUCE REINHART (now a 
federal magistrate judge); ERICA DUBNO. JOHN STEPHENSON. (Make a note to discuss Erica Dubno, NYC attorney, 
when we talk. I wonder if she might not be of some help.) 
LAWYERS FOR GHISLAINE MAXWELL: REPRESENTED BY COHEN GRESSER FIRM FIRST, THEN LAURA MENNINGER, 
DENVER, COLO. 
OTHER ATTORNEYS PAID BY EPSTEIN WHO TO REPRESENT VARIOUS WITNESSES: MIKE DUTKO. "THERE ARE SEVERAL 
OTHERS THAT SLIP MY MIND BUT ILL REMEMBER AND SEND THEM."

PROTECTIVE ORDER 
Upon a showing of good cause in support of the entry of a protective order to 
protect the discovery and dissemination of confidential information or information which 
will improperly annoy, embarrass, or oppress any party, witness, or person providing 
discovery in this case, IT IS ORDERED: 
1. 
This Protective Order shall apply to all documents, materials, and information, 
including without limitation, documents produced, answers to interrogatories, 
responses to requests for admission, deposition testimony, and other 
information disclosed pursuant to the disclosure or discovery duties created by 
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. 
2. 
As used in this Protective Order, "document" is defined as provided in 
FED.R.CIv.P. 34(a). A draft or non-identical copy is a separate document 
within the meaning of this term.

confidential and implicates common law and statutory privacy interests of (a) 
plaintiff 
and (b) defendant Ghislaine Maxwell. 
4. 
CONFIDENTIAL information shall not be disclosed or used for any purpose 
except the preparation and trial of this case. 
5. 
CONFIDENTIAL documents, materials, and/or information (collectively 
"CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION") shall not, without the consent of the 
party producing it or further Order of the Court, be disclosed except that such 
information may be disclosed to: 
a. attorneys actively working on this case;

working on this case whose assistance is required by said attorneys in the 
preparation for trial, at trial, or at other proceedings in this case;

h. other persons by written agreement of the parties. 
6. 
Prior to disclosing any CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION to any person 
listed above (other than counsel, persons employed by counsel, Court 
Personnel and stenographic reporters), counsel shall provide such person with 
a copy of this Protective Order and obtain from such person a written 
acknowledgment stating that he or she has read this Protective Order and 
agrees to be bound by its provisions. All such acknowledgments shall be 
retained by counsel and shall be subject to in camera review by the Court if 
good cause for review is demonstrated by opposing counsel. 
7. 
Documents are designated as CONFIDENTIAL by placing or affixing on them 
(in a manner that will not interfere with their legibility) the following or other 
appropriate notice: "CONFIDENTIAL." 
Discovery material designated 
CONFIDENTIAL shall be identified by Bates number. To the extent practical, 
the respective legend shall be placed near the Bates number. 
8. 
Designation of a document as CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION shall 
constitute a representation that such document has been reviewed by an 
attorney for the designating party, that there is a valid and good faith basis for 
such designation, made at the time of disclosure or production to the receiving 
party, and that disclosure of such information to persons other than those 
permitted access to such material would cause a privacy harm to the 
designating party.

9. 
Whenever a deposition involves the disclosure of CONFIDENTIAL 
INFORMATION, the deposition or portions thereof shall be designated as 
CONFIDENTIAL and shall be subject to the provisions of this Protective 
Order. Such designation shall be made on the record during the deposition 
whenever possible, but a party may designate portions of depositions as 
CONFIDENTIAL after transcription, provided written notice of the 
designation is promptly given to all counsel of record within thirty (30) days 
after notice by the court reporter of the completion of the transcript, and until 
the expiration of such thirty (30) days after notice by the court reporter of the 
completion of the transcript, no party or counsel for any such party may share 
the contents of the deposition outside the limitations of this Protective Order. 
10. 
Whenever a party seeks to file any document or material containing 
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION with the Court in this matter, it shall be 
accompanied by a Motion to Seal pursuant to Section 6.2 of the Electronic 
Case Filing Rules & Instructions for the Southern District of New York. 
11. 
A party may object to the designation of particular CONFIDENTIAL 
INFORMATION by giving written notice to the party designating the disputed 
information. The written notice shall identify the information to which the 
objection is made. If the parties cannot resolve the objection within ten (10) 
business days after the time the notice is received, it shall be the obligation of 
the party designating the information as CONFIDENTIAL to file an

appropriate motion requesting that the Court determine whether the disputed 
information should be subject to the tenns of this Protective Order. If such a 
motion is timely filed, the disputed information shall be treated as 
CONFIDENTIAL under the terms of this Protective Order until the Court rules 
on the motion. If the designating party fails to file such a motion within the 
prescribed time, the disputed information shall lose its designation as 
CONFIDENTIAL and shall not thereafter be treated as CONFIDENTIAL in 
accordance with this Protective Order. In connection with a motion filed under 
this provision, the party designating the information as CONFIDENTIAL shall 
bear the burden of establishing that good cause exists for the disputed 
information to be treated as CONFIDENTIAL. 
12. 
At the conclusion of this case, unless other arrangements arc agreed upon, each 
document and all copies thereof which have been designated as 
CONFIDENTIAL shall be returned to the party that designated it 
CONFIDENTIAL, or the parties may elect to destroy CONFIDENTIAL 
documents. Where the parties agree to destroy CONFIDENTIAL documents, 
the destroying party shall provide all parties with an affidavit confirming the 
destruction.

This Protective Order shall have no force and effect on the use of any 
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION at trial in this matter.

Mike, 
I think it would be useful to get a better understanding of your position—it would be helpful for us to know, 
for example, how much time you propose to take to evaluate matters, and whether we can provide any 
additional information that might be useful for that process of evaluation. That likely will affect our 
determination regarding the grand jury appearance, at which we would expect, were we to call 
to 
ask her a number of questions we would expect to argue to the court do not implicate a fifth am n m n

Victoria's Secret Models 
Over the years, though Epstein was never employed by L Brands, he corresponded and met with company executives. He attended 
Victoria's Secret fashion shows; some of the models were guests on his private island, according to a former Epstein employee. 
Epstein courted young women through the Miami modeling agency MC2, putting them up in an apartment he owned on 66th Street in 
Manhattan, a former agency bookkeeper said in a 2010 deposition in a civil case. L Brands has employed models from MC2 over the years. 
A spokeswoman for L Brands declined to comment on whether any were tied to Epstein. 
Models were an Epstein theme,  according  to William Mook, head of Mok Industries in Columbus. 
an investment opportunity in September 2005 to Ed Razek, an L Brands executive who helps select Victoria's Secret models. Epstein invited 
the two men to the Manhattan mansion and when he and Razek showed up, Mook said, they were welcomed by young women who 
said they were working as models for Epstein. An L Brands spokeswoman didn't respond to a request for an interview with Razek. Much 
like the mansion, the Boeing 727, on which Epstein shuttled famous friends including Bill Clinton, was also a hand-me-down from Wexner, 
records show. Epstein had the tags changed to a vanity plate ending in "JE," according to documents obtained by JetTrack. 
Epstein used the jet on at least one occasion in the 1990s to travel to Abigail Plantation in Georgia, a quail-hunting preserve Wexner named 
for his wife, according to a person familiar with the itinerary. The two men went hunting and Epstein came back empty-handed, the person 
said. 
In Epstein's infamous "Little Black Book" of contacts, first published by the now-defunct website Gawker in 2015, there are hundreds of 
names. Dozens of phone numbers are listed for Wexner -- for his home, the plantation, residences in London and Aspen as well as for 
various vehicles and staff associated with each property, plus more for executives at Wexner's companies. 
These former ties could be liabilities for Wexner, who in a 2003 Vanity Fair article praised Epstein for his "combination of excellent 
judgment and unusually high standards." What's more, Wexner said, "he is always a most loyal friend." 
He said he met Epstein after pitching

Thanks for letting us know about the possible meeting location change— please let us know once you've been able to 
confirm with your client, and we can let 
know so that she can cancel the car service. 
Regarding the court conference, we are unfortunately not able to reserve seats for anyone—the court manages court 
security and the crowd, so we don't have control over that. The other victim attorneys have been attending the 
conferences on their own, and although I don't know, I would guess that means that they have been arriving early.

Our first discovery production will include approximately 12 GB of data. As a result, we need to request that you please 
provide us with a drive (or drives if you would like multiple copies) on which to load the discovery for you. You can either 
bring the drive(s) to tomorrow's conference, or you can send them to our office at the below address to my attention. 
Once we receive a drive (or drives) from you, we will get it loaded and sent back out to you as quickly as possible. 
Additionally, if you would like Mr. Epstein to receive his own electronic copy of the discovery to review at the MCC, please

Subject: RE: Briefing in Florida regarding whether the Florida NPA extends to New York 
Hi 
I wanted to make you aware of a recent filing (on Tuesday) by Jane Doe 1 and 2 in the Florida CVRA case. See attached. 
You may find interesting our argument at pp. 3-6, in which we explain why Judge Marra must craft remedies in the case 
that relate solely to Florida crimes and Florida victims ... because the NPA only covers Florida. 
We filed our reply brief on remedies on Tuesday — and that should have brought all briefing on remedies for the CVRA 
violation to a close. But yesterday Epstein's lawyer (Marty Weinberg) filed a motion for a sur-reply. See attached. In 
point (a) on page 2, he argues that he should have an opportunity to file a sur-reply discussing, among other things, the 
scope of the NPA. On Monday, we will be filing an opposition to Weinberg extending the briefing further. It appears 
that Judge Marra is poised to rule rapidly on the motion for a sur-reply, as he asked for us to respond quickly. 
I wanted to make you aware of these developments. My clients were told back in 2013 that the NPA did not extend to 
New York or other jurisdictions — and that is the point we are making to Judge Marra.

THE COURT: So, today's conference was scheduled at 
the end of the July 18 court conference hearing on that date. 
I thought that we would devote at least the -- well, probably 
most of today's proceeding to talking about the schedule in 
this case, and I asked the lawyers to get together and see if 
they could come up with a mutually agreeable schedule, which 
would include trial date, motion practice, discovery, etc. 
Does anybody want to let me know how you made out? 
: Yes, your Honor. 
We have conferred with defense counsel and talked 
about a proposed schedule for this case. So we are prepared to 
propose to the court today a schedule for discovery, for 
discovery-related motions, for pretrial motions, and we are 
also prepared to talk about setting a possible trial date. 
THE COURT: Okay. What have you got in mind? 
: So, with respect to discovery, we would 
propose a discovery deadline of October 31 to complete 
discovery, with one exception. There are materials from 
devices seized from the defendant's residence in New York, and 
the F.B.I. is beginning the process of reviewing that data. 
In discussing that with defense counsel, we have begun 
to discuss a process for a privilege-review protocol. It's 
possible that process may take longer than October 31. But 
aside from that universe of documents, we would propose setting 
a schedule of October 31 as a deadline for discovery. 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00014547
--- PAGE 3 ---

j7v2espC kjc 
For discovery-related motions, we would propose that 
the defense file any motions that they are aware of relating to 
discovery, to include motions relating to the nonprosecution 
agreement, by September 13 --
THE COURT: By when? 
: September 13, your Honor. 
-- that the government be permitted to respond by 
October 4; with any reply due on October 11, as necessary. 
Of course we understand that if the defense comes to 
have additional motions related to discovery based on the 
ongoing discovery process that we will confer and propose an 
additional briefing schedule beyond that, as necessary. But 
with respect to motions that the defense is already aware of, 
including the NPA, that is the schedule that we would propose 
at this time. 
Regarding pretrial motions, your Honor, we would 
propose that the defense file their motions by January 10, that 
the government be permitted to respond by February 10, and that 
any replies be due on or before February 24. 
THE COURT: Got it. 
: And finally, your Honor, we are prepared to 
discuss a trial date in this case. The government is asking 
the court to set a trial date in this matter. We would propose 
that the court schedule this matter for trial in June of next 
year, and we estimate that the trial would take approximately 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00014548
--- PAGE 4 ---
j7v2espC kjc 
four to six weeks, and so that trial date would carry into 
July. And I understand that the defense has some comments 
about that proposal, but that's the government's proposal with 
respect to a trial date. 
THE COURT: Okay. Let me hear from the defense. 
Do I understand it correctly that, with the exception 
of the trial date, those dates are agreeable? 
MR. WEINBERG: Those dates are agreeable, your Honor. 
THE COURT: Counsel, whatever you wish to add, that 
would be fine. 
MR. WEINBERG: We would ask the court to set a 
preliminary trial date immediately after Labor Day. I say 
preliminary because we want time to assess Mr. Epstein's 
THE COURT: This year? 
MR. WEINBERG: Yes. 
THE COURT: This Labor Day. Okay. 
MR. WEINBERG: We want time to assess Mr. Epstein's 
ability to . . 
(Counsel confer) 
MR. WEINBERG: I'm sorry. I am being told that your 
Honor was inquiring as to the year. Let me --
THE COURT: Yes. I thought you wanted a speedy trial, 
and so --
MR. WEINBERG: Not with a four- to six-week trial with 
discovery coming in October, Judge. I apologize for being 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00014549
--- PAGE 5 ---
j7v2espC kjc 
imprecise. Labor Day 2020 or immediately thereafter. And I 
make that recommendation -- we haven't received the discovery 
yet. Understandably, it is coming, and I'm not in any way 
contesting that there has been a delay, but we haven't had an 
opportunity to start reviewing what the government has 
predicted to be over a million pages of discovery with 
Mr. Epstein and to assess Mr. Epstein's ability to exercise his 
constitutional right, while at MCC, in assisting counsel 
prepare for a very difficult case that addresses events that it 
is alleged occurred 14 to 17 years ago. 
THE COURT: Okay. 
MR. WEINBERG: So, we need time to receive a million 
pages of discovery and to prepare to defend a four- to six-week 
trial, when a lot of the immediate attention is going to be on 
the very unique and complex constitutional issues connected to 
the nonprosecution agreement, our contention that the 
government's allegations are inextricably intertwined and 
constitutionally barred by the NPA. There are double jeopardy 
issues both connected to the conspiracy count, which looks to 
be an overlap with one of the charges that was expressly within 
the immunity provisions in the NPA. We are going to be 
spending a lot of time, and that's why I agreed with the 
government that we should make early discovery motions on the 
NPA-related issues, on double-jeopardy-related issues, so that 
we could not only facially brief the motion to dismiss, but 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00014550
--- PAGE 6 ---
j7v2espC kjc 
have the discovery, the subfacial discovery, if you will, so 
that we could make a comprehensive briefing along the lines of 
the schedule for motions. 
THE COURT: That's what I was going to suggest, if 
there is a time period when you could put it all together, as 
it were, and there is a lot of flexibility. So I will leave 
these dates, you know, for now. 
With respect to the trial date, I could accommodate 
either June or September of 2020. The issue is not so much as, 
from my point of view, when you are all ready, but what part of 
the calendar I block out. So is it realistic to block out time 
in June? 
MR. WEINBERG: I think it is -- I don't want to have 
the court block out a six-week time and then come to the court 
in March and say we need a continuance and risk a September 
date. 
THE COURT: Got it. Okay. So a September date, you 
are saying, sounds like it certainly is realistic. 
MR. WEINBERG: Thirteen months sounds like the amount 
of time that we would ordinarily need to prepare a case of this 
magnitude and scope. 
THE COURT: All right. That is fine for me. 
Just while we are taking care of details, a speedy 
trial issue or application? Why don't we extend it to 
September of 2020? 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00014551
--- PAGE 7 ---
j7v2espC kjc 
MR. WEINBERG: This case certainly meets all of the 
statutory criteria for complexity and we would agree to that 
extension, Judge. 
: Your Honor, may I briefly be heard with 
respect to the trial date? 
THE COURT: Oh, sure. You know, it does sound like it 
is kind of premature, but I'm happy to hear you. It is often 
the defense that is ahead of the government, or not often, but 
equally, but here it is the other way around. So if the 
defense is not ready, it would be my practice to defer to the 
defense, but I don't know that it is fixed in stone either way. 
But, sure, I am happy to hear you. 
: Your Honor, by way of background, we had 
initially proposed to the defense a May trial date. We think 
that there is a public interest in bringing this case to trial 
as swiftly as manageable. We understand, given their concerns 
in wanting to have more time, we proposed a date in June as a 
compromise position. We understand if the defense has 
indicated that they need additional time. We are sensitive to 
those concerns. But we do have a concern about the notion of 
setting a September trial date and that that trial would be 
preliminary or as a placeholder. Thirteen months is a 
considerable amount of time for a case of this nature to go to 
trial; and, again, given the time period of the charged conduct 
and the length of time that's passed, we do think that there is 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00014552
--- PAGE 8 ---
j7v2espC kjc 
a public interest in scheduling a fixed trial date in this 
case. Of course we understand if issues arise in the interim, 
we will address that as it occurs, but we do think it makes 
sense at this juncture to set a firm trial date. We don't 
think that any delay in this case is in the public interest. 
THE COURT: Counsel. 
MR. WEINBERG: We think that the delay in bringing 
this charge, your Honor, the natural corollary of that is to 
make it more difficult, not easier, for us to defend 
Mr. Epstein. For instance, there are certain sealed files for 
potential witnesses that we would have to go to other courts to 
seek to unseal. There is an NPA to litigate. This case is not 
your ordinary 1591 case. A case of four to six weeks is not 
the ordinary amount of time the government takes to prosecute, 
whether it is old or new cases. We need 13 months. I'm trying 
to make a principled argument, Judge, that that would be a 
schedule that we would try our best to meet, conditioned on our 
ability to work with Mr. Epstein under the current conditions. 
Thank you, sir. 
THE COURT: Okay. 
So, we are going to monitor the case from now until 
then anyway, so I think everybody will be in a better position 
to know what is realistic with respect to a trial date. I will 
exclude time from today through, let's say, June 8, but that, 
of course, is without prejudice to hearing from the defense and 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00014553
--- PAGE 9 ---
j7v2espC kjc 
the government as to actually where things stand. Long before 
then we will know. So we will have a conference, or several, 
between now and then. Let's see where everybody is as the 
months go by, and then we will know when we can effectively 
hold the trial. 
So I am going to find, under 18 United States Code 
3161, that the request for adjournment, joined in by both 
sides, is appropriate and warrants exclusion of the adjourned 
time from Speedy Trial calculations. I further find that the 
exclusion is designed to prevent any possible miscarriage of 
justice, to facilitate these proceedings, including extensive 
pretrial preparation, and to guarantee effective representation 
of and preparation by counsel for both sides, and thus the need 
for exclusion and the ends of justice outweigh the interests of 
the public and the defendant in a speedy trial pursuant to 18 
United States Code E. 3161(h)(7)(A) and (B). So that exclusion 
goes to June 8, 2020 preliminarily. 
Counsel, is it your thought that these motions would 
be on submission or did you want to have oral argument with 
respect to any aspect of them? 
MR. WEINBERG: We would seek oral argument, your 
Honor. 
THE COURT: So let's set October 28, 2019 for oral 
argument, and I am tentatively reserving some time on my 
calendar, as I said before, on June 8, 2020, but I will have 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00014554
--- PAGE 10 ---
IC 
j7v2espC kjc 
much better feel for where things are long before that and 
certainly I would say on October 28 we would have a much 
clearer picture of how things stand. 
So there you have it. Did you have 
go ahead. 
: Just to clarify, your Honor, what time would 
the court like the parties to appear on October 28? 
THE COURT: 10 a.m. 
: Thank you, your Honor. 
THE COURT: And the June 8 date is 9 a.m. Okay? 
MR. WEINBERG: Would your Honor want to schedule an 
argument on the substantive motions that will be fully briefed 
before the court on February 24? 
THE COURT: Yup. 
So let's schedule that oral argument for March 12, 
2020, at 10 a.m. 
Great. So anything anybody else has to talk about? 
MR. WEINBERG: Not from the defense, your Honor. 
: Not from the government, your Honor. Thank 
you. 
THE COURT: Okay. 
MR. WEINBERG: Thank you very much, sir. 
THE COURT: Nice to see you all. 
oOo

Following up on our phone conversation earlier today, thank you for being in touch and advising us of your 
representation of 
in connection with Mreceipt of a grand jury subpoena. So you have contact info 
for our full team, we're all reachable anytime at the copied emails or by phone at: 
As we briefly discussed, the documentary materials we are seeking from 
in the first instance are any flight 
manifests, flight plans, or other documents reflecting passengers and/or travel records, dating back to 2000. And we 
would like to hear from IIIIIIaboutMobservations, if any, of young women or girls on flights, as well as any discussions 
with Mr. Epstein about his relationships with young women or girls, or his legal issues relating to those relationships. 
We are also interested to know the identities of Epstein's employees and staff whom 
is aware of, current 
and previous. 
As I mentioned on the phone, given the prospect of attorney proffer information and/or a possible voluntary interview, 
we are prepared to hold in abeyance the current subpoena return date of July 22, 2019. 
thank you,

Subject: Epstein Arrest Seizure Items 
Hi 
Sorry to bug you while you may be working on a bail reply. 
I'm having trouble reaching Agent 
to coordinate pickup of the cellphone and other items seized upon Epstein's 
arrest. She said she'd be out in the field, but I don't hear from the intermediary agent — identity unknown — who was 
supposed to handle it in her absence. Can you step in and try to move this along? 
Thanks a lot.

Apologies for the delay on this, and thanks for following up. The best way to coordinate this is to contact the case 
agent directly — I just spoke to her so she'll be expecting your call. They're running around, so if you reach out and 
aren't able to connect today please let me know, but hopefully we can get it coordinated. The contact is Special 
Agent 
and she can be reached at

person upon arrest. Marty's returning to Boston shortly. Can you arrange for me to take possession of those items?

I think it would be useful to get a better understanding of your position—it would be helpful for us to 
know, for example, how much time you propose to take to evaluate matters, and whether we can provide 
any additional information that might be useful for that process of evaluation. That likely will affect ur 
determination regarding the grand jury appearance, at which we would expect, were we to cal 
to ask her a number of questions we would expect to argue to the court do not implicate a fifth amen ment 
privilege—i.e., that she couldn't simply blanket invoke. Would it be useful to discuss via phone?

Epstein and/or his agents to perform a personal massage on him at his private residence, located at

Counsel, 
The Government's first discovery production in this case has been loaded onto the drive you provided this afternoon and 
is ready for pickup at our office. If you are sending a runner to pick up the production, he or she should just ask for the 
envelope with Michael Miller's name on it. I've also attached a copy of the accompanying discovery and disclosure letter 
to this email. 
Please let me know if you have any difficulty accessing the discovery on the drive.

hi ghislaine, 
it was good to hear from you the other day. i thought i d fill you in 
on my situation and see how we can work together. 
i am still dancing, pilates-ing and teaching. i am very interested to 
keep training jeffery as we work well together and i enjoy working with 
him. 
i understand he likes to work with a variety of beautiful, talented 
young women and i think that training with lots of people can be a very 
good thing. i understand what i am looking for in other people to 
train / work with him, and it's quite a tall order, which is why i know 
that you need some help you find people. they don't come along every 
day. 
i need to use my time effectively; to continue with my dance classes, 
learning, training and also earning money to pay for it all. 
if i am looking for girls i will need to go to a wide variety of 
classes, whereas at the moment i tend to stick to the one's i like. 
(not necessarily the one's to find suitable girls). 
so if you want me to be actively looking, then we will need to reach a 
financial arrangement as this will be my job. or if you just want me to 
let you know if i come across someone suitable on my travels, then what 
will you pay me for this? as i am effectively 'doing myself out of a 
job'. 
i would just like to have a good idea of where i stand, and if i will 
be getting more work from you, or if you can put me in touch with other 
people who may want a trainer. or if i can make 'looking for other 
people' my main source of income. 
as i am here properly now, i have bills and rent to pay, i need to find 
something somewhat stable. 
i can be available to travel, but if i am 'on call' i need to know and 
be paid accordingly. 
i have a couple of girls in mind, so let me know what arrangement we 
will have, and i will do my best to help. 
i am appreciative of any work you can throw my way. 
i look forward to seeing you when you're back in nyc. give my best to 
rainy england! 
love

I think it would be useful to get a better understanding of your position—it would be helpful for us to 
know, for example, how much time you propose to take to evaluate matters, and whether we can provide 
any additional information that might be useful for that process of evaluation. That likely will affect our 
determination regarding the grand jury appearance, at which we would expect, were we to call

his caller got directed to call the 1-2500 intake line (wrongly, as that is just for law

H. DORN WILLIAMS JR. 
Attorney at Law 
Over 45 Years' Experience 
Martindale-Hubbell "AV" Rated 
Trials & Appeals. State & Federal Courts 
July 19, 2019 
U.S. Attorney's Office 
Re: 
USA v. Jeffrey Epstein 
Dear 
The bullet Epstein dodged that no one is talking about. He did so because of the combined 
actions of former U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta, former Palm Beach County State Attorney 
Barry Krischer, the Palm Beach County Sheriffs Office, and the assistant state attorney(s) that 
handled Jeffrey Epstein's criminal pr9secution in state court. 
At his plea and sentencing, the judge asked why Epstein was going to serve his sentence in 
the Palm Beach County stockade instead of in a Florida state prison, like most sex offenders. 
The response was we just decided that was the best way to accomplish what needed to be 
done here and agreed that the sentence satisfied everyone's requirements. 
His carefully constructed plea and sentence accomplished Epstein avoiding the Jimmy Ryce 
Act, relating to the indefinite civil commitment of sexual predators. If he had been eligible for 
Jimmy Ryce commitment, there is a substantial likelihood that he would have been indefinitely 
committed and warehoused with other sexual predators. 
Epstein was charged with two felony offenses: (1) procuring a person under the age of 18 for 
prostitution, a second-degree felony, punishable by 15 years in prison, and (2) felony 
solicitation of prostitution, a third-degree felony, punishable by 5 years in prison. He was facing 
a maximum consecutive sentence of 20 years in prison. 
Florida, like the Federal Courts, has sentencing guidelines. Epstein's guidelines calculated the 
"lowest permissible prison sentence of 21.5 months," or almost two years in state prison. In 
Florida, the court can go below the lowest permissible range via a motion for downward 
departure, or plea bargain. Epstein avoided a 21.5-month prison system via plea bargain. 
EFTA00014615
--- PAGE 2 ---
To understand how he avoided the Jimmy Ryce Act, you need to look at his carefully 
constructed sentence. According to the plea sheet he signed, regarding his conviction for felony 
solicitation of prostitution, he was sentenced to 12 months in the county jail. Regarding is 
conviction for procuring a person under the age of 18 for prostitution, a second-degree felony, 
he was sentenced to 6 months county jail consecutive to the above 12-month sentence, and 
that term of incarceration was to be followed 12 months community control. In other words, he 
was sentenced to 18 months incarceration in the county jail. 
What if he had been sentenced to 18 months in prison, instead of the county jail? In 2008, the 
Jimmy Ryce provided that to be eligible for indefinite civil commitment as a sexual predator the 
person had to be: 
. .'.serving a sentence in the custody of the Department of Corrections, a 
person who was adjudicated delinquent and is committed to the custody of the 
Department of Juvenile Justice, or a person who was involuntarily committed 
to the custody of the Department of Children and Family Services upon an 
adjudication of not guilty by reason of insanity. §394.912(1), Fla. Stat. (2008). 
Defendants that might satisfy the definition of a sexual predator were excluded from 
consideration if they were serving their time in a county Jail. I have defended sex offenders and 
men being prosecuted under the Jimmy Ryce Act In 2005-2006, as an assistant public 
defender, I defended about 25 men; being prosecuted under the Jimmy Ryce Act. I advised 
young public defenders to have sex crime offenders to take time in the county jail for this very 
reason. 
In 2008, an experienced sex crimes prosecutor would have been aware of this county jail 
loophole.' If they say they were not aware of this loophole, they are incompetent or untruthful. 
In 2014, this loophole was closed. The above section was amended to include, ". .. a person 
who is serving a sentence in a county or municipal jail for a sexually violent offense. . ." 
§394.912(1), Fla. Stat. (2014). Now, :a defendant cannot avoid the Jimmy Ryce Act by doing 
his time in the county jail, like Epstein. 
For purposes of the Jimmy Ryce Act a "sexually violent offense" includes any criminal act that 
is subsequently determined to be pripven beyond a reasonable doubt to have been "sexually 
motivated." A "sexually motivatedi crime is one whose purpose, in part, was for sexual 
gratification. Certainly, prostitution related offenses, and particularly with the facts of his case 
were committed in part for sexual gratification. The misnomer is that violence does not have 
to be an element of the crime. 
If Epstein had been in prison, instead of the county jail, the Department of Children and Family's 
Multidisciplinary Team would have evaluated Epstein and submitted its written assessment 
and recommendation to State Attorney Barry Krischer. Epstein would have been back in the 
A defense attorney cannot be faulted for getting a disposition that avoids Jimmy Ryce 
consequences, because his duty is to his client. 
EFTA00014616
--- PAGE 3 ---
State Attorney's lap for the filing a petition to seek his indefinite civil commitment. Once a 
petition is filed, the offender is held in custody at the Florida Civil Commitment Center. There 
is no bond/bail. 
Having tired these cases, representing the defendant, the case is a battle of experts. The six-
person jury must unanimously find by clear and convincing evidence whether the person 
has the requisite prior conviction, has a mental abnormality affecting a person's emotional 
or volitional capacity which predispopes the person to a sex offense, and is likely to engage 
in further sex crime to such a degreeas to pose a menace to the health and safety of others, 
unless he is indefinitely confined for treatment. 
This potential "rabbit hole" was avoided simply by where Epstein was incarcerated. 
In determining whether Epstein would satisfy the criteria for the State Attorney to file a petition 
for involuntary commitment, the psychologist/psychiatrist evaluators use a diagnostic tool 
known as Static-99. It is used throughout the United States and Canada. See the attached 
Static-99 form. Plus, the evaluators can go behind the mere charges that he pled to. 
Having a familiarity with Static-99 evaluation forms while representing men who had petitions 
filed against them, based on the Static-99, Epstein arguably qualified for the filing of a petition. 
I am not an expert, but I rough calculated his score, using the score sheet applicable at the 
time of his plea, as 4, which translates to a moderate to high risk of re-offending. 
If Epstein was sentenced to state prison by the State Attorney Krischner, there is a likelihood 
he would have been back in front of that same State Attorney for potential indefinite civil 
commitment. Instead of recently returning from France, Epstein might still be at the facility in 
Arcadia, Florida, with over 600 other sexual predators. Florida has more people committed 
than any other state. 
There are other anomalies in the handling of this case. He was indicted for the first charge 
(2006CF9454). In the Federal system, felony prosecution is initiated by Indictment, or the 
prosecutor and the defense agree to the file of an Information charging a specific crime(s). In 
Florida, the only crime that requires an Indictment is first-degree murder. In Florida, the State 
Attorney is referred to an a "one-man grand jury because the State Attorney can with the stroke 
of a pen initiate a criminal prosecution for any crime, other than first-degree murder. Over 98% 
of crimes in Florida are charged by Information filed by an assistant state attorney. 
According to The Miami Herald  article, Detective Recarey also told The Miami Herald that in 
May 2006, he drew up probable cause affidavits that charged Epstein and three associates 
with a slew of sex crimes. But instead of pushing forward with the case, Krischer referred the 
case to the grand jury, which returned an Indictment on a single count of soliciting prostitution. 
In Florida state court, the prosecutor frames the charge it wants the grand jury to consider and 
brings an Indictment and the applicable law and instructions.2
I would be curious how many indictments in Palm Beach County in 2005-2006 were returned 
for crimes other than first-degree murder cases? How many sex crimes prosecutions were 
As an assistant state attorney, I presented Indictments to the grand jury. 
EFTA00014617
--- PAGE 4 ---
initiated by indictment? These questions a federal prosecutor unfamiliar with our state court 
system night not ask. 
Regarding the first case, there are over 140 docket entries. A demand for discovery was never 
filed. If it had been filed, the State Attorney would have to file an answer. Under Florida law, 
the answer is a public record, as well as most of the documents produced in conjunction with 
the answer. This kept the facts out of the public eye.3
Regarding the second case (2008CF009381). an Information was filed June 26, 2008. But the 
usual probable cause affidavit setting forth the facts of the crime was not filed.4 He plead guilty 
four days later. Does the transcript of the plea colloquy set forth a factual basis, or did he 
stipulate there was a factual basis? 
In summary, with no probable cause affidavit in either case, or demand for discovery the public 
has no idea about the facts supporting the charges. Epstein was sex offender like my former 
public defender clients. But money. powerful friends, the U.S. Attorney, the Palm Beach State 
Attorney and Sheriffs Office agreed to an unusual sentence structure whereby Epstein avoided 
potential Jimmy Ryce Act indefinite civil commitment. Ask for proof that any other serial sex 
offender was sentenced to more than 365 days incarceration and was permitted to serve his 
time in the Palm Beach County Jail I am not a hypocrite, as a criminal defense attorney. I too 
would have sought to structure a sentence to avoid the Jimmy Ryce Act. 
The defense obtained a spectacular outcome. But, the outcome was only possible because (1) 
a U.S. Attorney's Office was apparently afraid to try a case that was less than a slam dunk 
winner, (2) a state court prosecutor was apparently afraid to try a case that was less than a 
slam dunk winner, and (3) a Sheriff who went along with the sentencing scheme. Ask the 
sheriff how many times he has honored this type of sentencing arrangement. 
Sincerely yours,

I'll follow up but the harassment is getting worse 
She is getting text messages and the like from reporters still which she ignores 
The only concerning thing I have was today someone sent her a video of Jeffrey Epstein to her YouTube account. 
She didn't know she had one until she got a notice about it. 
I don't know what can be done to get these reporters and media people to stop as they seem to not understand the 
answer "'no"

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

J7irepsd 
(Case called) 
THE COURT: I had hoped to have a written decision and 
order by now, which I don't, one that is regarding the 
release/remand of Mr. Epstein, which has been the subject of 
multiple written submissions and, as you all know, an in-court 
hearing on Monday, July 15, 2019. It is not quite physically 
produced yet and it needs to be cite checked, but I should have 
it on the docket in the next hour, two hours at most. What 
will do, however, is state the conclusions in the decision and 
order, which I had said I would do, and summarize very briefly 
the contents of the ruling for you. 
Starting with my conclusions, the government's 
application for continued remand is hereby granted and the 
defense application for pretrial release is respectfully hereby 
denied. Written opinion to follow. 
In that opinion I will deal with all, I'll try to, all 
the principal issues which have been briefed. Even though it 
is not entirely necessary or legally required to consider both 
dangerousness to others and to the community as well as risk of 
flight, I have done so. I also deal with the defense's 
proposed bail package. There is obviously significant public 
interest in all of these legal issues, so I tried to cover them 
all as best I could. 
There are the following headings in the decision and 
order. First is a background section, followed by counsel's 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00014630
--- PAGE 3 ---
J7irepsd 
submissions. Those are the written submissions: principally 
the indictment, the legal principles governing release versus 
remand, the presumption of remand in 18 U.S.C. section 1591 
cases, danger to others and the community. This topic has 
seven subsections and fills over ten pages of the decision and 
order. I think it is fair to say that it is the heart of this 
decision, that is to say, dealing with danger to others and to 
the community. 
Then I deal with risk of flight. That has four 
subsections or factors, which are substantially the same 
factors that are used to analyze dangerousness. 
Then, finally, the bail package proposed by the 
defense. Specifically, I find in the decision and order that 
the government has established dangerousness to others and to 
the community by clear and convincing evidence and also that 
the government has established risk of flight by a 
preponderance of the evidence. I also reject the proposed bail 
package as irretrievably inadequate and go on in some detail 
concerning what I consider to be its deficiencies. 
Incidentally, I am not suggesting that a different 
bail package would be appropriate because I doubt that any b[_i_ 
package can overcome danger to the community. 
I focus then on dangerousness to others, most 
certainly including the minor victims in this case and 
prospective victims as well. I cite and quote, for example, 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00014631
--- PAGE 4 ---
J7irepsd 
the compelling testimony of 
, who 
testified that they fear for their safety and the safety of 
others if Mr. Epstein were to be released. 
I also point out that the presumption of remand, as 
opposed to the presumption of release, is unusual in our 
jurisprudence and that it attaches only to very serious crimes, 
such as sex trafficking involving minor victims, as in this 
case some allegedly as young as age 14. 
I also discuss evidence of intimidation and threats 
and compensation paid to potential witnesses and the facts 
surrounding whether or not Mr. Epstein has been compliant with 
his legal obligations as a registered sex offender. 
When discussing risk of flight, which you obviously 
can tell comes after, in my analysis, dangerousness to the 
community, when discussing that aspect, risk of flight, the 
decision speaks to the seriousness of the charged crimes, to 
Mr. Epstein's great wealth and his vast resources, which 
include private planes and frequent international travel and 
also a foreign residence in Paris. 
I mention the items very recently seized from Mr. 
Epstein's New York City mansion pursuant to lawful search 
warrants, which include sexually explicit photos and discs, 
some $70,000 in cash, diamonds, and an expired Austrian 
passport with Mr. Epstein's photo but with a name that is 
different from Jeffrey Epstein, and also contains a reference 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00014632
--- PAGE 5 ---
J7irepsd 
to Saudi Arabia as a residence. 
I think I have given you a fair account of the 
decision and order. As I said before, the written version in 
its complete form, which will be about 30 to 34 pages long I 
imagine, I hope will be available reasonably soon. 
One piece of business in light of today's ruling. 
thought I would schedule a conference with the parties for 
Wednesday, July 31, at 11:00 a.m. That is not fixed in stone. 
If you all want to meet and confer and let me know if that is a 
convenient date, or I'm happy to accommodate you with another 
date as well. 
For the moment, I'll tentatively schedule a conference 
for July 31st at 11:00 a.m. and ask if there is an application 
for exclusion of speedy trial. 
: Yes, your Honor. The government moves to 
exclude time under the Speedy Trial Act from today's date until 
July 31st. 
THE COURT: I am going to find under 18 United States 
Code section 3161 that adjournment to and including July 31 at 
11:00 a.m. is appropriate and warrants exclusion of the 
adjourned time from speedy trial calculations. I further find 
that the exclusion is designed to prevent any possible 
miscarriage of justice, to facilitate these proceedings, and to 
guarantee effective representation of and preparation by all 
counsel for both parties, both sides. Thus, the need for 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00014633
--- PAGE 6 ---
J7irepsd 
exclusion and the ends of justice outweigh the interests of the 
public and the defendant in a speedy trial pursuant to 18 
U.S.C. section 3161(h)(7)(A) and (B). 
Finally, a word about the proposed conference. From 
my point of view, it would be more or less a scheduling/case 
management type conference, but I'm happy to consider any 
issues that you might have at that time. 
I think that's it. Everybody, thank you for being 
here. We are adjourned.

The parties respectfully and jointly write to request an extension of time to file a letter in 
response to the Court's Order of May 11, 2021, requiring the parties to submit a joint letter 
regarding the overall pretrial schedule. (Dkt. No. 277). The joint letter is currently due on May

for an extension of this deadline have been made.

The parties seek this extension in order to permit continuation of productive discussions 
that the parties have already initiated regarding the pretrial schedule. The parties conferred 
yesterday for approximately 45 minutes by telephone on that topic. Although the conversation 
was productive, there remain multiple points of disagreement. The requested extension will permit 
the parties to consider each other's proposals as to certain deadlines, and to further confer with the 
aim of minimizing the points of disagreement that will need to be resolved by the Court.

UNITED STATES ATTORNEY'S OFFICE

U.S. ATTORNEY GEOFFREY S. BERMAN 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
Monday, July 8, 2019 
NYPD 
Phil Walzak 
CONTACT: U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE 
FBI 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN CHARGED IN MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURT 
WITH SEX TRAFFICKING OF MINORS 
Alleged Conduct Occurred in both New York and Florida over Multiple Years, 
Involving Dozens of Victims 
Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, 
., the Assistant Director in Char e of the New York Field Office of the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI"), and 
Commissioner of the New York 
City Police Department ("NYPD"), announced that JEFFREY EPSTEIN was arrested Saturday 
and charged with sex trafficking of minors and conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors. 
The indictment unsealed today alleges that, between 2002 through 2005, EPSTEIN sexually 
exploited and abused dozens of underage girls by enticing them to engage in sex acts with him in 
exchange for money. Epstein allegedly worked with several employees and associates to ensure 
that he had a steady supply of minor victims to abuse, and paid several of those victims 
themselves to recruit other underage girls to engage in similar sex acts for money. He committed 
these offenses in locations including New York, New York, and Palm Beach, Florida. EPSTEIN 
is expected to be presented in Manhattan federal court this afternoon before U.S. Magistrate 
Judge Henry B. Pitman. The case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Richard M. Berman. 
U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said: "As alleged, Jeffrey Epstein abused underage 
girls for years, operating a scheme in which girls he victimized would recruit others for Epstein 
to exploit and abuse. Epstein exploited girls who were vulnerable to abuse, enticed them with 
cash payments, and escalated his conduct to include sex acts, often occurring at his residence on 
the Upper East Side of Manhattan. While the charged conduct is from a number of years ago, 
the victims — then children and now young women — are no less entitled to their day in court. 
My Office is proud to stand up for these victims by bringing this indictment." 
EFTA00014638
--- PAGE 2 ---
FBI Assistant Director 
said: "We are asking anyone who may 
have been victimized by Jeffery Epstein, or anyone who may have information about his alleged 
criminal behavior, to please call us. The number is 1-800-CALL-FBI. We want to hear from 
you, regardless of the age you are now, or whatever age you were then, no matter the incident 
that took place. The bravery it takes to call us might empower others to speak out about the 
crimes committed against them. It is important to remember there was never, nor will there ever 
be an excuse for this type of behavior. In the eyes of the FBI, the victims will always come 
first." 
NYPD Commissioner 
said: "Today's charges serve as a warning to 
individuals who continue to prey upon some of our society's most vulnerable population: we are 
coming for you. I thank and commend the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District and 
the FBI for their tireless efforts to ensure child predators are taken off our streets. The NYPD 
will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to eradicate the trafficking of children 
in our city and nation and work to bring justice to victims of these heinous crimes." 
If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, 
please contact the FBI at 1-800-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
According to the Indictment' unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
From at least 2002 through at least 2005, JEFFREY EPSTEIN enticed and recruited, and 
caused to be enticed and recruited, dozens of minor girls to visit his mansion in New York, New 
York (the "New York Residence"), and his estate in Palm Beach, Florida (the "Palm Beach 
Residence"), to engage in sex acts with him, after which he would give the victims hundreds of 
dollars in cash. In order to maintain and increase his supply of victims, EPSTEIN also paid 
certain victims to recruit additional underage girls whom he could similarly abuse. In this way, 
EPSTEIN created a vast network of underage victims for him to sexually exploit, often on a 
daily basis, in locations including New York and Palm Beach. 
EPSTEIN's victims were as young as 14 at the time he abused them, and were, for 
various reasons, often particularly vulnerable to exploitation. Moreover, EPSTEIN knew that 
many of his victims were under 18, including because, in some instances, victims expressly told 
him they were underage. 
In creating and maintaining this network of minor victims in multiple states to abuse and 
exploit sexually, EPSTEIN worked with others, including employees and associates who 
facilitated his conduct by, among other things, contacting victims and scheduling their sexual 
encounters with EPSTEIN at the New York Residence and at the Palm Beach Residence. 
In both New York and Florida, EPSTEIN perpetuated this abuse in similar ways. 
Victims were initially recruited to provide "massages" to EPSTEIN, which became increasingly 
sexual in nature and would typically include one or more sex acts. EPSTEIN paid his victims 
hundreds of dollars in cash for each encounter. 
I As the introductory phrase signifies, the entirety of the text of the Indictment, and the description of the Indictment 
set forth herein, constitute only allegations, and every fact described therein should be treated as an allegation. 
EFTA00014639
--- PAGE 3 ---
In particular, during encounters at the New York Residence, victims would be taken to a 
room where they would perform a massage on EPSTEIN, during which EPSTEIN would 
frequently escalate the nature and scope of physical contact with his victims to include, among 
other things, sex acts such as groping and direct and indirect contact with the victims' genitals. 
In connection with the encounters, EPSTEIN, or one of his employees or associates, typically 
paid each victim hundreds of dollars in cash. Once minor victims were recruited, EPSTEIN or 
his employees or associates would contact victims to schedule appointments for "massages." As 
a result, many victims were abused by EPSTEIN on multiple subsequent occasions. 
To further enable him to abuse underage girls, EPSTEIN asked and enticed certain of his 
victims to recruit additional minor girls to perform "massages" and similarly engage in sex acts 
with EPSTEIN. When a victim would recruit another underage girl for EPSTEIN, he paid both 
the victim-recruiter and the new victim hundreds of dollars in cash. Through these victim-
recruiters, EPSTEIN maintained a steady supply of new victims to exploit, and gained access to

Hey Chris, 
Following up on our conversation today regarding the stip, would you agree to have the sentence say that the document is 
a "true and accurate copy of the transcript of one witness's trial testimony, but not the full trial transcript, given on 
February 26 ... ."? If so, we are fine with the stip — and, of course, happy to consider other language that makes the same 
point.

• 
People who came to give JE massages did not wear uniforms; they wore casual clothes 
(jeans, t-shirts, sneakers, sweatpants) 
• 
People giving massages were female; they were not professional, trained masseuses; they 
did not show up with equipment to give massages 
• 
saw some females waiting outside house, In thought they were waiting for someone to 
pick them up after massage 
• 
sometimes saw females walking to ring doorbell; most of the time heard doorbell and let 
females in 
• 
Sometimes more than one female came at a time; 
remembers one time when two girls 
came, one girl waited in the kitchen and one went upstairs; 
doesn't remember what the 
girls looked like; the two girls seemed like friends; came together and left together after 
certain period of time; they were young girls (high school age)

Exhibit 52, Dkt. No. 457, and the Defendant&#8217;s response, which has been temporarily filed

hereby ORDERED to file a reply to Defendant&#8217;s response on or before 12:00 p.m. on 
November 21, 2021. The letter reply should address the Defendant&#8217;s argument that 
Employee-1 cannot authenticate Government Exhibit 52 because Mr.

working for Mr. Epstein. The parties are FURTHER ORDERED to file any proposed redactions to

Re: 
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) 
Dear Counsel: 
Today the Government is producing additional materials, including Jencks Act and 
Giglio material, regarding witnesses who may be called to testify at trial in the above-referenced 
case. Enclosed please find an index detailing the materials included in today's production. 
The Government is also producing today certain materials relating to individuals the 
Government does not currently intend to call as witnesses at trial in the above-referenced case. 
These materials do not contain a comprehensive set of Jencks Act and Giglio materials, as the 
Government does not expect to call these individuals to testify at trial. Instead, these materials 
contain, among other things, certain witness statements. Enclosed please find an index detailing 
these materials. This production should not be taken to indicate that the Government believes it 
has any obligation to provide all of these materials; rather, we make this production as a courtesy. 
Moreover, although the Government presently does not intend to call the individuals listed in the 
enclosed index, we reserve the right to do so and will notify you should the Government determine 
that it intends to call any of these individuals at trial. 
EFTA00014650
--- PAGE 2 ---
Page 2 
Please note that this letter, the enclosed index, and the enclosed materials are governed 
by the July 31, 2020 Protective Order in this case. In particular, the materials are designated 
as "confidential" under the Protective Order. The index is itself designated as "confidential," 
because it includes information regarding records designated as "confidential" under the 
Protective Order. The Department of Justice directed this office to cease the dissemination of 
materials marked with the word "confidential" in order to avoid potential confusion with markings 
reserved for classified documents. Accordingly, in order to note the appropriate designation of 
this production under the operative Protective Order in this case, the materials being produced 
today are marked with the following label: "SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER 
PARAGRAPHS 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, and 17." This marking directly refers to the specific paragraphs 
of the Protective Order that govern today's production.

Laura, 
I'm attaching a corrected cover letter for the discovery production. The letter inadvertently listed SDNY_GM_02774195 
instead of SDNY_GM_02774105. We have sent a hard drive to your office in Colorado (the FedEx tracking number is 8166 
1429 9380). We have also sent a hard drive to your client at the MDC via FedEx. The tracking number for the drive is 
8166 1445 3318, and the tracking number for the password is 8166 1445 3307. We are leaving a hard drive at our office 
for pickup under Chris's name. 
We have uploaded the production except for SDNY_GM_02774100-SDNY_GM_02774104 to USAfx. We could not upload 
SDNY_GM_02774100-SDNY_GM_02774104 due to size limitations. The materials have been added to the same USAfx 
production folder 
shared with you earlier today.

Counsel, 
We have an additional discovery production ready to send to you. Attached please find the accompanying cover letter. 
That will be produced on a hard drive to you. In addition, a supplemental production of testifying witness and non-
testifying witness material and exhibits are also ready to send to you. Attached please find the accompanying cover letter 
and indices. Those materials will be on the hard drive as well. We will also produce the testifying witness and non-
testifying witness material and exhibits via USAfx. 
Please let us know if you would like to pick up the drive today or if you would like us to FedEx it (and if so, to where). 
Please let us know if you would like us to send today via FedEx a hard drive with these materials to Ms. Maxwell at the

Counsel, 
To our knowledge, Spencer Kuvin does not represent any of the witnesses the Government expects to call at trial in this 
case. Because this individual does not represent any witnesses in this case, we do not see a need to raise this issue with 
the Court. 
We agree that compliance with Local Rule 23.1 is important. To that end, we note that David Markus, an attorney who 
has filed a notice of appearance in the Second Circuit on behalf of Ms. Maxwell, and who was present for the arraignment 
before Judge Nathan last month, has also made public statements to the press regarding this case, which run the risk of 
violating the rule. See, e.g., https://nypost.com/2021/05/05/ghislaine-maxwell-on-enhanced-security-schedule-lockup-
fecIst 
Our hope is that by alerting you to this concern now, there will not be a need in the future to raise the issue with the 
Court. 
Best,

Subject: Conferral Regarding Possible Violation of Local Criminal Rule 23.1 
Counsel — 
The linked article by the Sun dated yesterday contains a number of statements which, if made by a lawyer associated with 
a witness in this case, appear to violate Local Criminal Rule 23.1. See also Dkt. No. 28 (expectation of strict compliance 
with Rule 23.1 by "counsel for all involved parties"). The rule applies by its terms to any "lawyer participating in or 
associated with the investigation (including ... lawyers for targets, subjects, and witnesses in the investigation...):' 
https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/14875477/ghislaine-maxwell-plea-deal-same-fate-as-epstein/ 
I am writing to confer with you prior to bringing this to the Court's attention. Please let me know if you believe Mr. 
Spencer Kuvin represents any witness in this case. 
Given the urgency of this situation, I would appreciate a response by close of business Monday.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
United States of America, 
—v—
Ghislaine Maxwell, 
Defendant. 
USDC SDNY 
DOCUMENT 
ELECTRONICALLY FILED 
DOC  
DATE FILED: 5/11/21
20-CR-330 (MN) 
ORDER 
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
The Court has considered the parties' proposals regarding the commencement of trial. 
Dkt. Nos. 275, 276. For the reasons stated in the Government's letter, the Court will request 
November 29, 2021 from the Clerk's Office as the trial start date—that is the date (pending 
approval from the Clerk's Office consistent with the SDNY COVID protocols) that opening 
statements will be made to the jury. However, the Court will also request from the Clerk's 
Office that jury selection occur during the week of November 15. Counsel shall plan 
accordingly. 
The Court grants the Government's motion to exclude time until November 29, 2021. 
The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting an exclusion from speedy trial 
computations for the period from today's date through November 29, 2021, outweigh the 
interests of the public and the Defendant in a speedy trial, because this time is necessary to 
permit the defense to continue to review discovery and other materials in light of the superseding 
indictment; to permit the parties to prepare and file motions in limine; to permit the parties to 
make and review additional pretrial disclosures; and to allow adequate time for the parties to 
prepare for trial. Time is therefore excluded under the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. § 
3161(h)(7)(A), until November 29, 2021. 
EFTA00014666

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 277 Filed 05/11/21 Page 2 of 2 
In order to ensure that there is no delay in the commencement of trial, the Court will 
adjust the current pm-trial schedule. So that the Court can resolve motions in limine in advance 
of the November 29th trial commencement date, any such motions shall be fully briefed no later 
than four weeks in advance of the anticipated trial commencement date of November 29. The 
parties shall meet and confer to propose adjustments to other pre-trial disclosures accordingly. 
The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer for at least 30 minutes by phone 
regarding the overall pretrial disclosure schedule and submit a joint letter by May 14, 2021. The 
Court will accept only a joint letter with a joint proposal or with each side's views briefly stated. 
The letter must attest to the meet and confer. Any separately filed letters will be struck. 
SO ORDERED.

Re: 
Response to Government Letters dated May 4, and May 6, 2021 Regarding F.R. Crim. P. 
17(c) Subpoena, United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) 
Dear Judge Nathan, 
On March 15, 2021, Ms. Maxwell asked the Court to issue a F.R.Crim.P. 17(c)(3) 
subpoena for production of evidence controlled by Boies, Schiller, and Flexner ("BSF") lawyers 
working with the government on behalf of alleged (now-adult) witnesses. In her ex-parte 
application, Ms. Maxwell provided reasons for requesting certain items of evidence, including 
that the government either failed to secure the evidence or refused to produce it to Ms. Maxwell; 
she also disclosed theories related to her defense, strategy, and work product. 
After considering the application and BSF's response, the Court invited comment from 
the government regarding subpoenaed items 9 (a journal), 10 (boots), and 11(photographs). 
Specifically, the Court directed the government "to notify the Court of its views as to Requests 9 
through 11." Dkt. 252. 
The government's position is consistent with its general approach to evidence in this case 
which is to blindly accept information it considers unfavorable to Ms. Maxwell, begrudgingly 
EFTA00014671
--- PAGE 2 ---
The Honorable Alison J. Nathan 
May 12, 2021 
Page 2 
produce Brady material with various disclaimers such as "although the government is not 
obligated to do so" (Dkt. 269 pp. 8, 9), and obfuscate the importance of legitimate defense 
requests for discovery. The government repeatedly demonstrates that it views this process not as 
a search for the truth, but for a conviction at any cost, including the truth. 
Request 9, The Journal 
Accuser-2 has been represented by BSF since approximately 2016. She sued Ms. 
Maxwell and participated in the Epstein Victim Compensation Fund. She claims to have kept a 
journal for a period in 1996 in which she described various events, including her interactions 
with Jeffrey Epstein. Seven (7) photocopied pages of this journal, two of which are the front and 
back covers, were selectively produced by BSF in discovery during civil litigation to counsel for 
Ms. Maxwell, apparently as support for her claims against Epstein. The civil litigation was 
stayed and ultimately dismissed prior to resolution of questions related to the failure to produce 
the entire journal. Accuser-2 relied on select portions of the journal in public discussions with 
various representatives of the media and claims to have looked at the journal to "refresh [her] 
memory about this time." See, e.g., Michael Baker, "The First Women to Report Jeffrey 
Epstein," The Daily Podcast, NY Times (Aug. 26, 2019), Tr. at 2 ("When I was looking, trying 
to refresh my memory about this time, I came across this journal entry. [Host] [Accuser-2] has 
this journal from that time period. It's a spiral journal with a picture of two sisters on the 
front.").' 
When it suits its purpose, such as arguing against bail, the government touts the journal 
as powerful evidence, to wit, "Contemporaneous journal entries corroborate details of another 
Podcast audio and transcript located at https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/26/podcasts/the-
daily/epstein-rnaxwell 
?showTranscript=1.

--- PAGE 3 ---
The Honorable Alison J. Nathan 
May 12, 2021 
Page 3 
victim's account, including the details of when, where, and how that victim came to meet 
Epstein." Dkt. 100 p. II. And, the government has signaled its intent to introduce these pages at 
trial, arguing that there is no "basis for doubting the authenticity of the documents which the 
Government expects that [Accuser-2] will be able to properly authenticate at trial." Dkt. 268, p. 
5. 
What did, or did not, happen "about this time" and what Accuser-2 recorded, and did not 
record "about this time" is relevant, exculpatory, evidence. The government admits it does not 
have the remaining pages of the journal and admits that it has made no effort to read the 
remaining pages of the journal. This does not stop the government, however, from expressing 
baseless opinions about the journal's content, relevance, or admissibility because, in the blind 
search for a conviction regardless of the truth, ignorance is indeed bliss. The government 
implies that the journal, here, has "been evaluated for Brady material" (Dkt. 269 p. 4) which is 
not true. Free from any actual knowledge, the government liberally makes unfounded and 
misleading claims like: 
• 
"The remainder of the diary consists of [Accuser-2's] unrelated personal diary 
entries;" (Id., p.3) 
• 
"[T]he diary contains no relevant material;" (Id., p. 4) 
• 
The diary is "full of [Accuser-2's] personal and unrelated information;" (Id., p. 4 
n.1) 
• 
The diary is "likely to sweep in a significant period of [Accuser-2's] life before 
[she] met Epstein...." (Id., p. 6) 
The government makes additional questionable, contradictory, statements regarding the 
journal. The government offers that it "understands" that the item requested is Accuser-2's 
"entire diary from her teenage years." (Id., p.2) The "understanding" has no factual attribution 
EFTA00014673
--- PAGE 4 ---
The Honorable Alison J. Nathan 
May 12, 2021 
Page 4 
and is belied by an "understanding" months earlier where the government represented that 
Accuser-2 "stopped writing in her journal about a month after" her meeting with Epstein, Dkt. 
100, p.11 n.2. 
Incredibly, the government has never examined or taken possession of the journal and is 
relying on the representations of lawyers adverse to Ms. Maxwell in multiple civil litigations, the 
same lawyers who have taken an active role in providing the government with selective pieces of 
evidence and who regularly bash Ms. Maxwell in the media, hardly a reliable source.' 
It is fundamentally wrong to use a part of a writing to, for example, deny bail, or refresh 
recollection, or as a past-recollection recorded, or as a prior-consistent statement, and at the same 
time ignore the remainder of the writing. The government should know what is in the remainder 
of the journal; it simply chooses selective ignorance and relies on lawyers adverse to Ms. Maxwell 
for cover. This type of selective disclosure of information is routinely rejected by courts, including 
the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. Known as the "fairness doctrine," when one party makes 
assertions about parts of a communication or writing the entire communication loses protected 
status and requires disclosure to the opposing party. The aim of the doctrine is to protect the adverse 
"party, the factfinder, and the judicial process from selectively disclosed and potentially misleading 
evidence." In re von Bulow, 828 F.2d 94, 102 (2d Cir. 1987); see also United States v. 
Bilzerian, 926 F.2d 1285, 1292 (2d Cir. 1991); Joy v. North, 692 F.2d 880, 893-94 (2d Cir. 1982); 
Teachers Ins. & Annuity Assin of America v. Shamrock Broadcasting Co., 521 F.Supp. 638 
(S.D.N.Y. 1981). 
As Ms. Maxwell previously pointed out, another of BSFs clients confessed to creating a fake 
"diary" to sell to a tabloid news journalist, fifteen years after the fact, and while represented by 
BSF. See Dkt. 244 at 10 n.4. 
EFTA00014674
--- PAGE 5 ---
The Honorable Alison J. Nathan 
May 12, 2021 
Page 5 
Given that Accuser-2, the putative witness, has publicly claimed to rely on the journal to 
"refresh" her memory and the government's apparent intention to introduce the pages at trial other 
evidentiary principles related to fairness come into play. F.R.E. 106, the Rule of Completeness, 
allows that "Ulf a party introduces all or part of a writing or recorded statement, an adverse party 
may require the introduction, at that time, of any other part--or any other writing or recorded 
statement--that in fairness ought to be considered at the same time." 
Federal Rule of Evidence 612 is also applicable here and states: 
(a) Scope. This rule gives an adverse party certain options when a witness 
uses a writing to refresh memory: 
(1) while testifying; or 
(2) before testifying, if the court decides that justice requires the party to 
have those options. 
(b) Adverse Party's Options; Deleting Unrelated Matter. Unless 18 U.S.C. 
§ 3500 provides otherwise in a criminal case, an adverse party is entitled to 
have the writing produced at the hearing, to inspect it, to cross-examine the 
witness about it, and to introduce in evidence any portion that relates to the 
witness's testimony. If the producing party claims that the writing includes 
unrelated matter, the court must examine the writing in camera, delete any 
unrelated portion, and order that the rest be delivered to the adverse party. 
Any portion deleted over objection must be preserved for the record. 
(c) Failure to Produce or Deliver the Writing. If a writing is not produced or 
is not delivered as ordered, the court may issue any appropriate order. But if 
the prosecution does not comply in a criminal case, the court must strike the 
witness's testimony or--if justice so requires--declare a mistrial. 
The witness has admitted using the journal to refresh her memory. Title 18 of U.S. Code 
§ 3500 is inapplicable here by its very terms because the remainder of the journal is, admittedly, 
not in the possession of the government. See 18 U.S.C. § 3500(a) (applies exclusively to 
statements "in the possession of the United States"); see also United States v. Bin Laden, 397 F. 
Supp. 2d 465, 491 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) ("The statute thus establishes three essential elements 
EFTA00014675
--- PAGE 6 ---
The Honorable Alison J. Nathan 
May 12, 2021 
Page 6 
of 3500 Material: (1) a statement by the witness, (2) in the possession of the United States, (3) 
that relates to the subject matter of the witness's testimony."). 
This case now involves a ten-year time period beginning 27 years ago. The indictment 
and the accusers are vague regarding when things happened, what things happened and who may 
have been present when anything is alleged to have happened. Accuser-2's journal contains 
dated entries that place events in context with other alleged events. Accuser-2's journal from 
1996 purports to document encounters with Epstein in New York. The S2 indictment, paragraph 
9(b), claims that "Maxwell interacted with [Accuser-2] on at least one occasion in or about 1996 
at Epstein's residence in New Mexico...." The journal references other dates, places, and events 
in 1996. The absence of any mention of Ms. Maxwell in context with other recorded events is 
both relevant and exculpatory. 
As a piece of physical evidence, the journal is subject to inspection and testing. See F. R. 
Crim. P. 17(c)(1). Moreover, were the journal in the possession of the government it would be 
subject to inspection under F. R. Crim. P. 16 (a) (1) (E) which provides, in relevant part: 
Upon a defendant's request, the government must permit the defendant to 
inspect and to copy or photograph books, papers, documents, data, 
photographs, tangible objects, buildings or places, or copies or portions of 
any of these items, if the item is within the government's possession, 
custody, or control and: 
(i) the item is material to preparing the defense; 
(ii) the government intends to use the item in its case-in-chief at trial[.] 
To avoid any disclosure obligations, the government has simply accepted partisan 
photocopies of five substantive pages without questioning the provenance of an exhibit it intends 
to introduce at trial. Comparison of one of the five pages demonstrates the problem. Attached as 
exhibit A is a photocopy of a journal entry first produced during the civil litigation. A photocopy

of the same entry, produced in the criminal discovery and attached as exhibit B, is obviously, and 
noticeably, different. The remaining six pages are identical except for the identifying bate ranges. 
Examination of the original document would answer legitimate questions about whether the 
document has been manipulated, altered, or fabricated. Disclosure of the document in advance of 
trial would prevent the unnecessary delay of having a qualified forensic document examiner take 
possession of the document, run tests, and offer an opinion during the middle of trial. 
Request 10, the Boots 
The Court directed the government "to notify the Court of its views" regarding item 10. 
Instead of notifying the Court of its "views" the government, however, has taken steps to 
circumvent the pending defense subpoena request; it is "working to moot request 10" by having 
the FBI secure the boots, Dkt. 269, p.2. This is an interference with Ms. Maxwell's ability to 
investigate her defense without interference from the government. Ms. Maxwell's original 
request was ex pane, now the government is taking possession of the very things subject to Ms. 
Maxwell's subpoena. The government's actions demonstrate a willingness to take control of 
evidence when it is tactically advantageous to do so but resist disclosure when it is not. Ms. 
Maxwell requests that the court order production of the boots to her lawyers pursuant to the 
subpoena, not to the government. 
Request 11, the Photographs 
Regarding item 11, the photographs, the government offers inconsistent and illogical 
positions. In its letter of May 4, 2021, the government first advised the Court that it obtained 
"copies of the complete set of requested photographs" which it then produced to the defense. 
Two days later it admitted that "some of the original photographs are currently in the Prosecution 
Team's possession" and that it would "make them available to the defendant upon request."

The Honorable Alison J. Nathan 
May 12, 2021 
Page 8 
(Dkt. 271, p.1) Tripping over its own largess, the "Prosecution Team" neglected to mention that 
Ms. Maxwell and her lawyers traveled to New York to review all of the physical evidence, 
including original photographs, in person, at considerable expense from April 12 to April 16, 
2021. The government does not explain which original photographs it has in its possession nor 
does it offer any reason why these photographs were not made available "upon request." 
Attempts to confer with the government to explain these discrepancies have gone unanswered for 
days. 
Photocopies, in most cases, (and most certainly in this case) are not adequate substitutes 
for originals, particularly when the photocopies are produced by lawyers adverse to Ms. 
Maxwell, were not collected by law enforcement directly from the source, and are subject to 
manipulation. Any original photographs will have markings that identify when the film was 
developed and other indicia indicating whether they are genuine or not. Again, like the journal, 
the government has outsourced the fact and truth finding function regarding the photographs to 
partisan advocates. If the government possessed the originals Ms. Maxwell would have the Rule 
right to inspect them, just like the many photographs she inspected between April 12 and 
April 16, 2021. 
Finally, the government devotes much of its submission attempting to bait Ms. Maxwell 
into revealing defense strategy and work product. Ms. Maxwell is happy to address any questions 
regarding relevance and admissibility ex-parte should the Court need any additional information. 
Respectfully Submitted,

Hey Chris, 
Following up on our conversation today regarding the stip, would you agree to have the sentence say that the document is 
a "true and accurate copy of the transcript of one witness's trial testimony, but not the full trial transcript, given on 
February 26 . . . ."? If so, we are fine with the stip — and, of course, happy to consider other language that makes the same 
point. 
Thanks,

Counsel, 
Today, we are supposed to docket redacted versions of (1) the briefing on birth certificates, (2) the remaining briefing on 
GX-52, and (3) the Government's motion to quash. See Dkt. Nos. 473, 474, and 476. 
Attached are our proposed redactions. We have no redactions to our motion to quash. Our understanding is that the 
defense is not proposing any redactions. 
We propose that we will file a cover letter on the docket and send these all to the Court. After that, we'll file the redacted 
versions of our motions and you can file your responses, and we'll wait for you to file your redacted GX-52 brief before we 
file our reply. 
Please let us know if that works for you.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
United States of America, 
—v—
Ghislaine Maxwell, 
Defendant. 
USDC SDNY 
DOCUMENT 
ELECTRONICALLY FILED 
DOC 0: 
DATE FILED: 11/22/21 
20-CR-330 (MN) 
MEMORANDUM 
OPINION & ORDER 
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
The Defense on November 1, 2021, noticed eight expert witnesses. Def. Br., Ex. I 
("Notice"). Two of those experts, Dr. Park Dietz and Dr. Elizabeth Loftus, are expected to offer 
opinions that rebut opinions of the Government's expert witness, Dr. Lisa Rocchio. The 
Government on November 8, 2021, filed a motion to partially preclude the testimony of Dr. 
Dietz and Dr. Loftus. Dkt. No. 424. The Court has already addressed that motion. 
On November 15, 2021, the Government moved to fully or partially preclude the 
testimony of the remaining six experts. The Defense filed a response on November 19, 2021. 
The Court addressed the admissibility of Dr. Ryan Hall in a separate written opinion. In 
this opinion, the Court addresses the preliminary admissibility of Bennett Gershman based on the 
parties' current proffers. 
I. 
Legal standard 
Federal Rule of Evidence 702 governs the admissibility of expert testimony. That rule 
states: 
A witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or 
education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if: 
EFTA00014701
--- PAGE 2 ---
(a) the expert's scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help the trier 
of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue; 
(b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data; 
(c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and 
(d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case. 
The Court exercises a "gatekeeper function" in assessing the admissibility of expert 
testimony. Restivo v. Hessernann, 846 F.3d 547, 575 (2d Cir. 2017). To determine whether an 
expert's method is reliable, the Court considers the non-exhaustive list provided by the Supreme 
Court in Daubert, including whether the expert's method has been tested, whether it has been 
subjected to peer review, the rate of error, standards controlling the method's operation, and 
whether the method is accepted by the expert community. United States v. Kidd, 385 F. Supp. 3d 
259, 263 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (citing Daubert v. Merrell Dow Phanns., Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 593-94 
(1993)). 
But Rule 702 ultimately sets a "liberal" and "permissive" standard of admissibility. 
Nimely v. City of New York, 414 F.3d 381, 395-96 (2d Cir. 2005). In particular, not every expert 
admissible under Daubert need rely on a method that conforms with "the exactness of hard 
science methodologies." E.E.O.C. v. Bloomberg L.P., No. 07-CV-8383 (LAP), 2010 WL 
3466370, at *13-14 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 31, 2010) (quoting United States v. Simmons, 470 F.3d 
1115, 1123 (5th Cir. 2006)). 
Additionally, the procedure for disclosing expert witnesses is governed by Federal Rule 
of Criminal Procedure 16. That rule states that when the Government makes a request, the 
Defense "must ... give to the government a written summary of any testimony that the 
defendant intends to use under Rule[ ] 702.... This summary must describe the witness's 
EFTA00014702
--- PAGE 3 ---
opinions, the bases and reasons for those opinions, and the witness's qualifications." Fed. R. 
Crim. P. 16(b)(1)(C). The purpose of this rule is to "minimize surprise that often results from 
unexpected expert testimony, reduce the need for continuances, and to provide the opponent with 
a fair opportunity to test the merit of the expert's testimony through focused cross-examination." 
Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b)(1)(C) advisory committee's note to 1993 amendment. Thus, to satisfy Rule 
16, a notice must not merely describe the "general topics" on which experts will testify but 
actually "summarize the experts' opinions about those topics" and "describe the bases for the 
experts' opinions." United States v. Ulbricht, 858 F.3d 71, 115 (2d Cir. 2017) (emphasis added); 
United States v. Valle, No. 12-CR-847 (PGG), 2013 WL 440687, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 2, 2013) 
("Merely identifying the general topics about which the expert will testify is insufficient; rather, 
the summary must reveal the expert's actual opinions."). 
If the Defense's disclosure of an expert witness does not satisfy Rule 16, the Court has 
"broad discretion" to fashion an appropriate remedy. Ulbricht, 858 F.3d at 115. That discretion 
is guided by factors including "why disclosure was not made, the extent of the prejudice, if any, 
to the opposing party, the feasibility of rectifying that prejudice by a continuance, and any other 
relevant circumstances." Id. (quoting United States v. Lee, 834 F.3d 145, 159 (2d Cir. 2016)). 
When a disclosure merely lists general topics on which the expert might testify, the Second 
Circuit has several times held that the district court has discretion to exclude the expert entirely. 
See id. at 118; United States v. Vaccarelli, No. 20-3768-CR, 2021 WL 4805218, at *2 (2d Cir. 
Oct. 15, 2021). 
II. 
Discussion 
As a preliminary matter, the Defense argues that the Government's motion is 
"premature" because the Government's arguments are about the relevance and prejudice of the 
EFTA00014703
--- PAGE 4 ---
witnesses' testimony, not their qualifications or the reliability of their methods under Rule 702. 
Def. Br. at 1, 5-6. But one aspect of the Rule 702 and Daubert inquiry is "fit," which asks 
"whether expert testimony proffered in the case is sufficiently tied to the facts of the case that it 
will aid the jury in resolving a factual dispute." Alto v. Sun Phann. Indus., Inc., No. 1:19-CV-
09758 (GHW), 2021 WL 4803582, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 13, 2021) (quoting Daubed, 509 U.S. at 
591). Fit is satisfied if the expert's opinion would assist the jury's decision on a relevant 
question of fact without "usurp[ing] either the role of the trial judge in instructing the jury as to 
the applicable law or the role of the jury in applying that law to the facts before it." Id. (quoting 
United States v. Duncan, 42 F.3d 97, 101 (2d Cir. 1994)). The Court finds that at least some of 
the Government's arguments that go to fit are ripe for preliminary resolution now. Other aspects 
of the Government's motion can be resolved only with additional information and the context of 
trial. 
The Government moves to exclude the testimony of Bennett Gershman in its entirety. As 
explained in the notice, Professor Gershman "is a leading authority on prosecutorial 
misconduct." Notice at 12. The Defense expects that he will testify "on best practices to ensure 
the integrity of any prosecution, focusing on investigation, witness preparation, media contact, 
neutrality, obligations to provide accurate information, and relationship with crime victims, their 
counsel, and case-related civil litigation." Id. 
The Court will grant the Government's motion and exclude Gershman. First, his 
expected testimony is irrelevant. At the November 1 pretrial conference, the Court ruled that it 
would "preclude affirmative evidence by the defense that goes to the thoroughness of the 
investigation." Nov. 1 Tr. at 17. As the Court explained, "[t]he length of the investigation, the 
investigative techniques used, and the fact that the defendant was not initially a target of the 
EFTA00014704
--- PAGE 5 ---
investigation are all irrelevant" to Ms. Maxwell's guilt. Id. at 19 (quoting United States v. 
Duncan, No. 18-CR-289, 2019 WL 2210663 (S.D.N.Y. 2019)). The Court concludes that the 
expected topics of Gershman's testimony—investigation, witness preparation, media contact, 
being neutral and accurate, and relationships with victims-all fall within the rubric of attacking 
the thoroughness of the investigation rather than being probative of Ms. Maxwell's guilt of the 
crimes charged. In short, this testimony would run afoul of the instruction that the jury will 
receive that "the government is not on trial." Id. at 23 (quoting United States v. Knox, 687 F. 
App'x 51, 54 (2d Cir. 2017)). 
The Court notes that a court in this district recently excluded Gershman's testimony in a 
civil case in which he would have similarly criticized the SEC's investigation, including the use 
of cooperating witnesses. SEC v. Collector's Coffee Inc., No. 19-CV-4355 (VM) (GWG), 2021 
WL 3418829 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 5, 2021). That case differs from this one in several respects, but 
that court's basic reasoning informs and supports the Court's decision here. 
The Defense argues that the Court "expressly denied" prohibiting the Defense from 
calling an expert witness like Gershman. Def. Br. at 17. Tellingly, the Defense quotes no 
language from the Court for this proposition and instead cites only those pages of the Court's 
oral ruling in which the Court explained that it "will permit relevant cross-examination of the 
government's witnesses." Nov. 1 Tr. at 27. This language in no fashion supports the Defense's 
request to admit an expert to testify about government investigative techniques. The Court 
reiterates, however, that it will permit the Defense to pursue "lines of cross-examination of 
government witnesses [that] would be relevant to impeach a witness by suggesting bias or 
otherwise implicating their credibility," which could include the Defense's theory of witnesses' 
motives for "implicating Ms. Maxwell after Jeffrey Epstein's death." Id. at 28-29. 
EFTA00014705
--- PAGE 6 ---
Second, even if Gershman's testimony was relevant, Rule 403 prejudice would 
substantially outweigh for the reasons given at the November 1 conference. Id. at 21-24. 
Gershman's testimony would be likely to confuse the jury by suggesting that the Government's 
choices of investigative techniques are relevant to guilt, it would conflict with the Court's 
anticipated jury instruction that the Government is not on trial, it would substantially delay the 
trial, and it would, at most, be cumulative of the Defense's arguments that there is inadequate 
evidence on which to find Ms. Maxwell guilty. Indeed, placing an expert imprimatur on these 
arguments would only enhance the Rule 403 prejudice. 
Third, apart from Rule 401 and 403, the Defense's disclosure of Gershman does not 
satisfy Rule 16. The Defense has listed only the general topics on which Gershman will testify, 
like "investigation," "media contact," and "neutrality." Notice at 12. It does not mention 
Gershman's actual opinions on these topics or the bases for those opinions. Nor does the 
Defense's response brief add any detail about the content of Gershman's opinions. Def. Br. at 
18. Indeed, the Defense's briefing on this issue mentions very little of Gershman's anticipated 
testimony. Therefore, even if Rules 401 and 403 were satisfied, the Court would exclude 
Gershman's testimony because the Defense has not yet satisfied Rule 16. 
III. 
Conclusion 
The Court therefore grants the Government's motion to preclude Gershman's expert 
testimony. Because this is a preliminary pre-trial ruling, it is possible that facts and 
circumstances at trial would alter the Court's analysis. In that event, the Defense must re-raise 
its request to admit Gershman as an expert witness.

Nice note about the trial 
For a preview piece I am going to write about Maxwell's most prominent public accuser, 
not 
bein 
art of this case; no charges based on her allegations and not expect to be a witness for Gov. And also 
; not being on witness list; 
Assume no comment but any issues there?

Those are the addresses I have for him. I would try Stacey, his lawyer. She is usually very responsive. Thanks for 
handling this

FYI, since the Times article came out today about Epstein's incarceration and death, BOP has been receiving multiple 
new requests for the records released in the FOIA matter (ABC, CNN, MuckRack). BOP plans to respond to those 
requests quickly and release the same records. 
One minor wrinkle: the FOIA specialist at BOP has tried to contact Mark Epstein a couple times regarding his 
communications from about a month ago. But so far he has not responded to her. She has asked if we have contact info 
for him. What I have is this phone number 
and these emails Mark Epstein 
and 
STACEY RICHMAN 
. I am going to confirm BOP has these, but please let me know if there is 
some other way to contact him.

Hi M, 
Thanks very much for flagging. Our protocol in this case has been to forward all tips to the FBI-- our case agents

most likely, rather than the order of proof order (which is premised on the fastest imaginable version of the trial).

Dear 
In response to the above-referenced subpoenas and to your request by email on 
November 22, 2021, on behalf of our client JPMorgan Chase ("JPMorgan" or the "Finn"), we 
submit the enclosed encrypted zip file containing account documentation bates labeled JPM-
SDNY-00065519 through JPM-SDNY-00065530. 
As discussed on November 22, 2021, this production includes account documentation 
related to account numb 
in the name of ASW Holdings, Inc. 
We also wanted to provide the following additional information about the documents in 
our November 22, 2021 production. The November 22, 2021 production included account 
documentation related to account numbei 
in the name of Financial Trust 
Company, Inc. (JPM-SDNY-00065487 through JPM-SDNY-00065493); account documentation 
related to account number 
in the name of Jeffrey Epstein (JPM-SDNY-00065494 
throw h JPM-SDNY-00065499); and account documentation related to account number 
in the name of Ghislaine Maxwell (JPM-SDNY-00065500 through JPM-SDNY-
00065518). 
Should you require any additional materials, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act ("FOIA"), 5 U.S.C. § 552, 28 C.F.R. § 16.8, 
and any other applicable law, rule, or regulation, Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Don LLP 
requests on behalf of JPMorgan that confidential treatment be accorded to this letter (Bates 
numbered JPM-SDNY-CL-012-0001 through JPM-SDNY-CL-012-0003) and the referenced 
materials (Bates numbered JPM-SDNY-00065519 through JPM-SDNY-00065530 on JPM-

SDNY-VOL-012) (collectively, the "Confidential Material"). Accordingly, the Confidential 
Material has been marked "Confidential Treatment Requested by JPMorgan Chase." The 
Confidential Material contains confidential business information concerning JPMorgan. 
Furthermore, public disclosure of the Confidential Material could reasonably be expected to 
cause substantial competitive harm to JPMorgan. Accordingly, the Confidential Material is 
subject to, without limitation, Exemption 4 of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4), and the Trade 
Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1905, and will continue to remain exempt from mandatory disclosure 
even after the conclusion of the Department of Justice's ("Department") consideration of this 
matter. 
We note further that, since the Confidential Material constitutes investigatory records 
obtained by the Department in connection with a potential law enforcement proceeding, such 
records are subject, at least at present, to the exemption from mandatory disclosure under 
Exemption 7(A) of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(A).' Since the documents pertain to the 
activities of JPMorgan, its employees, and its clients and their employees and agents, and not to 
the activities of any federal agency, JPMorgan also believes the documents are exempt from 
disclosure pursuant to Exemption 7(C) of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(C).2
Should any third person request the opportunity to inspect or copy the Confidential 
Material pursuant to the FOIA or otherwise, we request on behalf of JPMorgan that the 
undersigned immediately be notified of such request and be furnished with a copy of all written 
materials pertaining to such request (including but not limited to the request and any agency 
determination with respect to such request). JPMorgan expects that it will be given an 
opportunity to object to such disclosure. And, should the Department be inclined to grant any 
such request, it is JPMorgan's expectation that, pursuant to the procedures required by 28 C.F.R. 
§ 16.8, and Exec. Order 12,600, 52 Fed. Reg. 23,781 (1987), we will be given reasonable 
advance notice of any such decision to enable our client to pursue any remedy that may be 
available to it.' In such event, we request that you telephone the undersigned rather than rely 
upon the United States mail for such notice. If the Department is not satisfied that the 
submission is exempt from disclosure pursuant to the FOIA, we stand ready to supply further 
particulars. 
The requests set forth in the preceding paragraphs also apply to any memoranda, notes, 
recordings, or other writings of any sort whatsoever which are made by, or at the request of, any 
employee of the Department (or any other government agency) and which (I) incorporate, 
include, or relate to any of the information contained in the Confidential Material; or (2) refer to 
any conference, meeting, telephone conversation, or interview between (a) our client's current or 
former employees, associates, representatives, agents, auditors, or counsel and (b) employees of 
the Department (or any other government agency). 
See, e.g., NLRB v. Robbins Tire & Rubber Co., 437 U.S. 214 (1978). 
See Dept ofJustice v. Reports Comm. For Freedom of Press, 489 U.S. 749 (1989). 
See, e.g., Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U.S. 281 (1979).

Hi Alison, 
I wanted to alert you to a recent development. 
was recently served with a subpoena for a de osition in Melissa 
Selinger v. Kimera Labs,_, 
Alexander Jelinek (20-cv-24267). 
ex-husband 
s being sued by a 
former employee on several grounds including sex discrimination, battery and IIED. 
is getting dragged in because 
they want to connect 
to 
actions while working for Epstein. 
The depo was set for November 30. The Defendants filed a motion to quash (attached), which the court granted and 
stayed the depo. The Plaintiff has filed a motion to reconsider (attached), and the Court has ordered the Defendant to 
respond. The Plaintiffs have included a copy of the NPA, 
depo and have made numerous factual allegations 
related to Epstein in their motion. 
I'll keep you updated as I learn more. 
Have a Happy Thanksgiving, 
Joe

I have attached several articles of mine that provide a sense of my research findings, especially on long-term 
memory for child sexual abuse experiences. I selected publications that are fairly "quick reads." I hope you find 
them of interest. I can follow this up with my vita and some associated information later tonight. Thank you, and 
Happy Thanksgiving!

REOUEST TO BE FILED UNDER SEAL 
BY EMAIL 
The Honorable Alison J. Nathan 
United States District Court 
Southern District of New York 
United States Courthouse 
Foley Square 
New York, New York 10007 
Re: 
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
The Government respectfully submits this letter in response to the Court's directive at the 
November 23, 2021 final pretrial conference that the Government provide its anticipated order of 
witnesses for the upcoming trial in the above-referenced matter.' Consistent with the Court's 
instruction, below is the order of witnesses that the Government currently expects to call during 
the first two to three days of trial: 
2. 
3. 
4. 
testifying under the pseudonym "Jane") 
(testifying under the pseudonym "O") 
The Government has also attempted to approximate the order in which its remaining 
witnesses will testify at trial. The Government notes, however, that this order may change, 
' The Government respectfully requests that this letter be filed under seal. Because this letter does 
not seek any relief or require any ruling by the Court, it is arguably not a judicial document subject 
to the common law presumption of access. Moreover, this letter contains the identities of 
witnesses, including witnesses whom the Court has authorized to testify using pseudonyms or their 
first names. 
EFTA00014889
--- PAGE 2 ---
Page 2 
depending on, among other factors, the pace of trial. Many of the below-listed witnesses will be 
traveling from out of state, and many witnesses have personal and/or professional obligations 
around which the Government is attempting to schedule. Accordingly, it is possible that the 
Government may call some of these witnesses in a different order than that indicated below. 
Additionally, the Government reserves the right to call additional witnesses should unexpected 
developments arise during trial. 
With those understandings, the Government currently expects to call its remaining 
witnesses in the following order: 
6. 
7. 
8. 
9. 
under the pseudonym "=") 
ther (testifying under the pseudonym '="2) 
ying only under his first name, "a) 
Eying only under her first name, "a) 
tifying only under her first name, "a") 
Eying under her full name, ' 
The Government previously indicated that this witness would testify under the pseudonym 
"John." Because defense counsel expressed concerns about confusion that could arise from that 
name, the Government has changed this pseudonym to "= 
EFTA00014890
--- PAGE 3 ---
Page 3 
Finally, the Government notes that it may elect not to call some of the above-listed 
witnesses as trial progresses. The Government will promptly inform the Court and defense counsel 
if it determines that any witness will not be called in the Government's case-in-chief. 
Respectfully submitted, 
DAMIAN WILLIAMS

SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
PHONE 
DISTRICT POC: 
Audrey Strauss U.S. Attorney 
Phone: 
SYNOPSIS: 
In connection with USAO-SDNY's defense of the Bureau of Prisons ("BOP") in ongoing Freedom of Information Act 
("FOIA") litigation against The New York Times, on Friday, July 2, 2021, the USAO-SDNY plans to release approximately 
2,700 pages of BOP documents related to Jeffrey Epstein's incarceration and suicide at the Metropolitan Correctional 
Center ("MCC"). These records were previously withheld due to the ongoing criminal prosecution against Tova Noel and 
Michael Thomas for falsifying records on the night of Epstein's suicide. As noted in UMR #2021-05-66021, USAO-SDNY 
entered into deferred prosecution agreements with Noel and Thomas in May 2021 and as such, USAO-SDNY no longer 
plans to assert a FOIA exception related to that criminal prosecution. The BOP documents the USAO-SDNY plans to 
release to The New York Times, which will be immediately available for publication by the Times, include: (i) internal BOP 
memoranda describing the events and circumstances of Epstein's incarceration and suicide, including the numerous 
failures that allowed Epstein the opportunity to kill himself; (ii) Epstein's psychological records from MCC; (iii) the autopsy 
report prepared by the New York City Office of the Medical Examiner ("OCME"); and (iv) internal emails within BOP and 
between BOP and USAO-SDNY from the day of Epstein's suicide reflecting generally a lack of understanding of what had 
happened. USAO-SDNY has notified our counterparts at the BOP and DOJ-OIG about the pending release. 
DESCRIPTION: 
On August 10, 2019, inmate Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide while housed in the Special Housing Unit at the 
MCC. USAO-SDNY is currently defending the BOP in connection with ongoing FOIA litigation filed by The New York Times 
seeking documents regarding Epstein. Previously, BOP had withheld a number of documents based on the pendency of 
the criminal prosecution of Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, the two guards on duty the night of Epstein's suicide who 
EFTA00014902
--- PAGE 2 ---
were accused of falsely indicating on BOP forms that they had completed required institutional counts and rounds. As 
noted in UMR # 2021-05-66021, in May 2021 USAO-SDNY entered into deferred prosecution agreements with Noel and 
Thomas and as such, USAO-SDNY has notified the presiding Judge in the FOIA litigation that BOP no longer plans to assert 
a FOIA exception related to that criminal prosecution. Accordingly, pursuant to Court-ordered deadlines in the FOIA 
litigation, the USAO-SDNY must produce the previously-withheld documents, which number approximately 2,700 pages, 
by July 2, 2021 to The New York Times, who will then be free to publish those materials. 
The materials primarily consist of internal BOP memoranda, reports, emails, and documents, as well as emails with USAO-
SDNY, as well as the autopsy report prepared by OCME. As noted above, the documents include the following topics and 
materials: (i) internal BOP memoranda from the day and night of Epstein's suicide; (ii) a photograph of a sign that was 
hung in the Special Housing Unit that stated that rounds on Epstein were mandatory, signed "God;' which had been 
defaced to include a question mark after "mandatory"; (iii) Epstein's psychological records at MCC, which generally show 
that he claimed not to be suicidal, attempted to manipulate staff, and received some special treatment at MCC; (iv) 
internal BOP memoranda evaluating the circumstances and failures that led to the conditions in which Epstein could kill 
himself, including the failure to reassign a cellmate, to perform counts or rounds, to ensure adequate staffing at MCC, and 
other failures at the institution; (v) emails within BOP and between BOP and USAO-SDNY from the day of Epstein's suicide 
which show efforts to find out what was happening at MCC and frustration that MCC was not providing information; (vi) 
emails showing that Main Justice took an interest following Epstein's suicide, and sent individuals to tour MCC; and (vii) 
the OCME autopsy report concluding that Epstein committed suicide by hanging. Pursuant to established case law, BOP 
plans to redact photographs of Epstein's corpse and photographs from the autopsy, as well as the names of AUSAs and 
lower-level BOP staff members. As noted above, USAO-SDNY has notified our counterparts at the BOP and DOJ-OIG 
regarding this pending release.

Thanks very much for passing this along. The permitted attorney contact on the list below only includes Vogelman 
without reference to her New York counsel. Would it be possible to add her two New York attorneys—Chris Everdell and 
Mark Cohen—to the list of people Maxwell can speak with on the phone, please? 
Ideally, we would like to get them added today so that they can speak with their client over the weekend to facilitate our 
discussions with them about next steps in the case. 
Thanks,

Attached is the corrected SW binder, which FBI informs me they are comfortable with. The only difference from the last 
binder I sent you is to change the date and time that the cell site simulator revealed that the phone is located at the 
subject premises from last night at 10:15pm to this morning at 7:36am. This should be ready to swear out as soon as the

The biggest thing he was asking about is what are the devices we will be reviewing (once it's split

Dear Counsel, 
Pursuant to the Court's November 1, 2021 Order we write to note our good faith

examples: 
Regarding the first, third, and fourth' designated categories, there are two issues for 
conferral. First, we assume that these proffered statements are limited to those individuals 
specifically identified by the government as "minor victims" in the indictment or correspondence 
to defense counsel dated October 11, 2021. There were many alleged minor victims in the 
Southern Florida state and federal investigations. To the extent that the government intends to 
include statements made to other alleged "minor victims" not specifically identified, Ms. 
"Statements made by Epstein to friends and Family of Minor Victims," "Statements 
made by CC-2 to friends and Family of Minor Victims," and "Statements made by Jeffrey 
Epstein to the Minor Victims or in their presence."

Maxwell objects. In addition, these categories do not contain any temporal limitations and we 
object to any statements allegedly made outside the dates of the alleged conspiracy. 
Category 2, "Statements made by Jeffrey Epstein to his employees" appears to, primarily, 
relate to statements that post-date any alleged conspiracy. The first exemplar is a statement 
allegedly from Epstein to CC-1 claiming that Ms. Maxwell "used to find girls for him." This 
statement, or statements like it, cannot have been made either in the course of or in furtherance 
of any conspiracy at issue here and are no more than "idle chatter." United States v. Lieberman, 
637 F.2d 95, 102 (2d Cir.1980) (challenged testimony "smack[ed] of nothing more than casual 
conversation about past events. It is difficult to envision how it would have furthered the 
conspiracy"). Similarly, the second example concerns direction from Epstein and CC-2 to CC-1 
to "help someone who was coming to take the computers...." Again, this statement does not 
appear to be during or in furtherance of any conspiracy alleged in the indictment. See Lutwak v. 
United States, 344 U.S. 604 (1953); Kruleivitch v. United States, 336 U.S. 440 (1949). We 
assume the third example relates to the time period alleged in the indictment. To the extent it 
does not we object. 
Best Regards, 
Jeffrey S. Pagliuca

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
INDICTMENT 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
TOVA NOEL, and 
MICHAEL THOMAS, 
Defendants. 
X 
The Grand Jury charges: 
INTRODUCTION 
1. 
On or about August 10, 2019, TOVA NOEL and MICHAEL 
THOMAS, the defendants, while on duty as correctional officers at 
the Manhattan Correctional Center ("MCC"), repeatedly chose not to 
do mandated counts of prisoners under their watch in the MCC's 
special housing unit ("SHU"). Instead, for substantial portions 
of their shifts, NOEL and THOMAS sat at their desk, slept, and 
browsed the internet. To conceal the deliberate dereliction of 
their responsibilities, NOEL and THOMAS repeatedly signed false 
certifications attesting to counts of inmates they never did. As 
a result of those false statements, the MCC believed prisoners in 
the SHU were being regularly monitored and accounted for when, in 
fact, as a result of the defendants' conduct, no correctional 
officer conducted any count or round of the SHU from approximately 
10:30 p.m. on August 9 until approximately 6:30 a.m. on August 10, 
EFTA00014985
--- PAGE 2 ---
at which time, as alleged herein, NOEL and THOMAS discovered the 
body of an MCC inmate, Jeffrey Epstein, who had committed suicide 
while unobserved earlier that morning. 
RELEVANT INDIVIDUALS AND ENTITIES 
2. 
The 
MCC is 
federal 
administrative 
detention 
facility located in Manhattan that is run by the Bureau of Prisons 
("BOP"). The MCC is one of several facilities used to house 
inmates who have been charged with federal crimes in the Southern 
District of New York, but who are awaiting trial. The MCC employs 
correctional officers, and their primary duty is to ensure the 
care, custody, and control of the inmate population of the MCC. 
3. 
TOVA NOEL, the defendant, has been employed as a 
federal correctional officer at the MCC since approximately 2016. 
As of August 2019, NOEL's primary assignment was the SHU. 
On 
August 9, 2019, NOEL worked a regular shift from 4 p.m. to 12 a.m. 
in the SHU, and then worked an overtime shift from 12 a.m. to 6 
a.m. on August 10, 2019, also in the SHU. 
4. 
MICHAEL THOMAS, the defendant, has been employed as 
a correctional officer at the MCC by the BOP since approximately 
2007. Beginning in approximately 2013, THOMAS was assigned to work 
as a materials handler supervisor, which is a non-custodial 
position, although THOMAS regularly worked overtime shifts as a 
EFTA00014986
--- PAGE 3 ---
correctional officer. THOMAS worked an overtime shift in the SHU 
on August 10, 2019, from 12 a.m. to 6 a.m. 
5. 
As 
detailed 
herein, 
Jeffrey 
Epstein 
was 
incarcerated at the MCC between his arrest on July 6, 2019, and 
his suicide on August 10, 2019. Epstein was detained pending trial 
in the Southern District of New York on sex trafficking charges. 
THE MCC AND INSTITUTIONAL COUNTS 
6. 
The MCC, which houses approximately 750 inmates at 
any time, assigns inmates to various housing units within the MCC, 
including general population and the SHU. The SHU is located on 
the ninth floor of the MCC and access to the SHU is controlled by 
a single locked door, which can only be opened remotely by an 
officer in the MCC's centralized control center (the "Control 
Center"). Within the SHU, inmates are assigned to six separate 
tiers, each of which can be accessed only via a single locked door 
to which the correctional officers assigned to the SHU have keys. 
Each tier has eight cells, each of which can house either one or 
two prisoners, and each individual cell - which is made of cement 
and metal - is accessed only through a single, locked door, to 
which correctional officers assigned to the SHU have keys. 
7. Correctional officers assigned to guard inmates at 
the MCC are required to conduct institution-wide counts of inmates 
at regular, scheduled intervals to ensure that each inmate is alive 
EFTA00014987
--- PAGE 4 ---
and accounted for within the MCC (the "institutional count"). On 
weekdays, the MCC conducts five institutional counts at 4 p.m., 10 
p.m., 12 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. Performing an institutional 
count is one of the most basic and essential aspects of a 
correctional officer's job, and the count is one of the most basic 
and essential functions of daily operation of the MCC. 
Two 
officers are required to complete the institutional count for each 
housing unit, including the SHU, and are further required to 
document their performance of the count on an official MCC form 
called a count slip. 
8. Specifically, on the count slip, both correctional 
officers are required to fill in the date and time the count was 
performed, write the total number of inmates physically present in 
the unit counted, and then each sign the form. The forms are then 
collected and delivered to the Control Center, where they are 
compared to the institution's inmate roster to ensure that each 
inmate is accounted for. 
Only after all the count slips are 
collected from each housing unit, and the numbers on the slips are 
matched to the institution's inmate roster, can the institutional 
count be deemed "cleared" or completed. 
Records of each 
institutional count, including the count slips, are provided to a 
supervising official and retained by the MCC. 
EFTA00014988
--- PAGE 5 ---
9. 
In 
addition 
to 
the 
institutional 
count, 
correctional officers assigned to the SHU are required to complete 
rounds every thirty minutes ("30-minute rounds"). 
Like the 
institutional counts, the 30-minute rounds are conducted to ensure 
that each inmate is alive and accounted for within their cell. 
Correctional officers working in the SHU are required to complete 
a form, which is reviewed and signed by their supervisor, 
documenting the date and time of each 30-minute round in each tier 
of the SHU. 
EPSTEIN'S PRIOR APPARENT SUICIDE ATTEMPT 
10. On July 6, 2019, inmate Jeffrey Epstein was 
arrested and detained at the MCC on sex trafficking charges. On 
July 10, 2019, Epstein was assigned to the SHU due to, among other 
things, risk factors for suicidality and safety concerns. 
11. On July 23, 2019, while housed in the SHU, MCC 
officers responded to an emergency call, and found Epstein on the 
floor of his cell with a strip of bedsheet around his neck. MICHAEL 
THOMAS, the defendant, was one of the MCC officers who responded 
to the incident. Although Epstein claimed that he did not recall 
how the sheet ended up around his neck, Epstein was subsequently 
transferred out of SHU to suicide watch. 
Inmates assigned to 
suicide watch are housed in a cell on the hospital wing floor, and 
EFTA00014989
--- PAGE 6 ---
are watched twenty-four hours a day by a staff member or a 
specially trained inmate companion. 
12. Epstein remained on suicide watch for approximately 
twenty-four hours, and then was transferred to psychological 
observation, until July 30, 2019. Psychological observation is 
less restrictive than suicide watch, but inmates are still housed 
in the hospital wing and watched twenty-four hours a day. 
13. On July 30, 2019, Epstein was transferred back to 
the SHU, and, at the direction of MCC's psychological staff, was 
assigned a cellmate, in order to ensure Epstein remained under the 
observation of another inmate at all times. 
Epstein was also 
assigned to the cell closest to the correctional officers' desk in 
the common area of the SHU, which was approximately fifteen feet 
from the cell. Correctional officers assigned to the SHU were also 
told to keep a close watch of Epstein in light of his prior apparent 
suicide attempt. 
EVENTS OF AUGUST 9-10, 2019 
14. On 
August 
9, 
2019, 
Epstein's 
cellmate 
was 
transferred out of the MCC at approximately 8:00 a.m. Despite the 
directions described above that Epstein have a cellmate, no new 
cellmate was assigned to Epstein's cell. 
15. TOVA NOEL, the defendant, was one of the assigned 
officers duty in the SHU from 4:00 p.m. on August 9, 2019 to 8 
EFTA00014990
--- PAGE 7 ---
a.m. on August 10. From 4:00 p.m. to 12:00 a.m., two other officers 
were on duty with NOEL in the SHU: one officer was assigned to 
work from 2 p.m. to 10 p.m. ("Officer-1"), and one officer was 
assigned to work from 4:00 p.m. to 12 a.m. ("Officer-2"). MICHAEL 
THOMAS, the defendant, started his shift in the SHU at 12:00 a.m. 
on August 10. From 12:00 a.m. until 8:00 a.m. NOEL and THOMAS were 
the only two officers on duty in the SHU. 
16. During the time period from 4 p.m. on August 9 to 8 
a.m. on August 10, officers on duty in the SHU, including TOVA 
NOEL and MICHAEL THOMAS, the defendants, were responsible for 
conducting five institutional counts: 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. on August 
9; and 12 a.m., 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. on August 10. NOEL, THOMAS and 
the other guards on duty were also responsible for completing 
paperwork attesting to each of those counts. While, as detailed 
herein, count slips were completed for each institutional count, 
in fact, not a single one of those institutional counts was done. 
17. TOVA NOEL, the defendant, and Officer-1 were 
responsible for conducting the 4 p.m. institutional count in the 
SHU. As video from the MCC's internal video surveillance system 
makes clear, NOEL and Officer-1 did not complete the 4 p.m. count. 
NOEL and Officer-1 did, however, complete and sign a count slip 
that falsely stated that the 4 p.m. institutional count had been 
completed. 
In reliance on that falsified count slip, at 
EFTA00014991
--- PAGE 8 ---
approximately 5:03 p.m., the Control Center cleared the 4 p.m. 
count. 
18. By or before 10 p.m., all inmates in the MCC were 
locked in their cells for the night. At or around that time, TOVA 
NOEL, the defendant, and Officer-2 were responsible for conducting 
the 10 p.m. institutional count in the SHU. However, video from 
the MCC's internal video surveillance system shows that NOEL and 
Officer-2 did not complete the 10 p.m. count. Nonetheless, NOEL 
and Officer-2 completed and signed a count slip falsely stating 
that the 10 p.m. institutional count had been completed. In 
reliance on that falsified count slip, at approximately 10:36 p.m., 
the Control Center cleared the 10 p.m. count. 
19. At approximately 10:30 p.m. on August 9, 2019, 
after TOVA NOEL, the defendant, had signed and submitted the 10 
p.m. count slip and the institutional count had been completed, 
TOVA NOEL, the defendant, briefly walked up to, and then walked 
back from, the door to the tier in which Epstein was housed. 
According to video obtained from the MCC's internal video 
surveillance system, this was the last time anyone, including any 
correctional officer, walked up to, let alone entered, the tier in 
which Epstein was housed until approximately 6:30 a.m. on August 
10. 
EFTA00014992
--- PAGE 9 ---
20. Officer-l's shift ended at approximately 10 p.m., 
and at approximately 12 a.m., MICHAEL THOMAS, the defendant, 
replaced Officer-2. 
TOVA NOEL, the defendant, and THOMAS were 
responsible for conducting the 12 a.m. institutional count in the 
SHU. 
As confirmed by video from the MCC's internal video 
surveillance system, NOEL and THOMAS did not complete the 12 a.m. 
count. Nonetheless, NOEL and THOMAS completed and signed a count 
slip for the 12 a.m. count that falsely stated that the 
institutional count had been completed. 
In reliance on that 
falsified count slip, at approximately 12:49 a.m., the Control 
Center cleared the 12 a.m. count. 
21. TOVA NOEL and MICHAEL THOMAS, the defendants, were 
additionally responsible for conducting the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. 
institutional counts in the SHU. As confirmed by video from the 
MCC's internal video surveillance system, NOEL and THOMAS did not 
complete either the 3 a.m. or the 5 a.m. count. NOEL and THOMAS 
nonetheless completed and signed count slips for both counts that 
falsely stated that they had completed the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. 
institutional counts. In reliance on that falsified count slip, 
at approximately 3:24 a.m. and 5:30 a.m., the Control Center 
cleared the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. counts, respectively. 
22. Moreover, despite the requirement that guards on 
duty in the SHU conduct and document regular, 30-minte rounds, 
EFTA00014993
--- PAGE 10 ---
TOVA NOEL and MICHAEL THOMAS, the defendants, did not perform any 
of the required 30-minute rounds during their shift between 
approximately 12 a.m. and 6:30 a.m. Nonetheless, the defendants 
completed, and NOEL signed, numerous 30-minute round reports 
falsely affirming that they had, in fact, conducted such rounds. 
23. During the night, instead of completing the 
required counts and rounds, TOVA NOEL and MICHAEL THOMAS, the 
defendants, were seated at the correctional officers' desk in the 
SHU common area, using the computers, and moving around the SHU 
common area. NOEL used the computer periodically throughout the 
night, including to search the internet for furniture sales and 
benefit websites. THOMAS used the computer briefly around 1 a.m., 
a.m., and 6 a.m. to search for motorcycle sales and sports news. 
Throughout much of the night, NOEL and THOMAS sat in their chairs 
and, at various points, appeared to be asleep. 
24. At approximately 4 a.m., the overnight supervisor 
briefly visited NOEL and THOMAS in the SHU, conferring with NOEL 
and THOMAS who were seated at and around the officers' desk, before 
leaving. At approximately 5:30 a.m., another correctional officer 
briefly visited the SHU, conferring with NOEL and THOMAS in the 
common area of the SHU before leaving. 
Aside from those two 
officers, no one else entered the SHU - and no one conducted any 
counts or rounds - the entire night. 
EFTA00014994
--- PAGE 11 ---
25. Shortly after 6:30 a.m., MICHAEL THOMAS and TOVA 
NOEL, the defendants, walked up to the tier in which Epstein was 
housed to serve breakfast. Epstein was alone in his cell and not 
responsive. A noose was around Epstein's neck. At approximately 
6:33 a.m., an alarm was activated in the SHU. 
A supervising 
correctional officer who had just started his shift ("Supervisor-
1") responded to the alarm, and as NOEL approached the door to the 
SHU to meet Supervisor-1, NOEL told Supervisor-1 that "Epstein 
hung himself." Epstein was transferred to a local hospital where 
he was declared dead shortly thereafter. 
A subsequent autopsy 
determined that Epstein had committed suicide by hanging himself. 
26. After arriving in the SHU, Supervisor-1 spoke with 
MICHAEL THOMAS and TOVA NOEL, the defendants. 
NOEL told 
Supervisor-1 "we did not complete the 3am nor 5 am rounds." THOMAS 
stated, "we messed up," "I messed up, she's not to blame, we didn't 
do any rounds." 
COUNT ONE 
(Conspiracy) 
27. In or about August 2019, in the Southern District of 
New York and elsewhere, TOVA NOEL and MICHAEL THOMAS, the 
defendants, knowingly conspired with each other and with others 
known and unknown to:

It was good, for the most part. Making progress. 
and I interviewed two witnesses on Friday at the BSF office in Fort 
Lauderdale. The third witness we were supposed to interview decided not to come at the last minute, because she 
decided she didn't want to be involved in the case after all this time has passed. She was not someone we were focused 
on at this stage, so while we may circle back at another time to see if she comes in, right now it's fine. 
We had a call with an attorney who represented FL victims a decade ago, and we're coordinating with him to schedule 
follow up interviews with two of the witnesses who were approached and said they weren't sure how the civil case their 
lawyer handled affected if they could talk to us. 
had a call with Robbie Kaplan right before the trip, and the upshot is we are making baby steps towards an interview 
with 
. They are concerned about her exposure, so we are discussing ways of addressing that, and the next 
step will likely be an attorney proffer.

We will be joined by two FBI agents who are focusing on the CBP topics that we have previously discussed. I expect one 
of those agents will take the lead on questioning Mr. 
The topics we expect to cover include: 
• The identities of any CBP employees Mr. 
recalls interacting with Jeffrey Epstein in the Virgin Islands. 
• Any steps Mr. 
recalls any CBP employees in the Virgin Islands taking to help Epstein and those traveling with 
Epstein to enter the country, including any steps that allowed Epstein or those traveling with him to avoid 
processing that travelers would normally undergo. 
• Any favors Mr. 
recalls Epstein doing for CBP employees in the Virgin Islands, such as trips to Epstein's island.

I apologize for the delay on this — I've added the relevant language about revocations to both the application and the 
order, and corrected a stray typo, so that stuff is good to go. But two quick things to note, not to belabor this, but — it 
doesn't look like there's any reference to the Trust Two documents —that may be because they're not referenced in any 
will? At a glance I don't see Trust Two in any of the wills, but I'd want to go back and look more thoroughly unless 
somebody already made the decision on that basis. And second, it references a 2019 Trust but I don't see any documents 
on that? I have to run out tonight but can certainly circle up with 
and/or 
tomorrow on any of this, or just ignore 
it if I've misread. 
thanks,

M, is it the intent to share those? If so, I'll just add it to every mention of each document, but if not then it's 
unnecessary. I don't think those are substantive dots but I defer.

Yes, I think this document accurately describes the materials we've received, with just a note that it doesn't appear to 
include revocations, so to the extent those are intended to be shared, I think that word may need to be added.

— I've updated the sharing order application to be one to share the additional trust and will documents we have now 
received. Would you take a look when you can? 
— I've tried to describe the various materials we have gotten from the estate attorneys over the last two weeks. 
Would you mind taking a look (or asking a paralegal to take a look) to make sure I've accurately described/characterized 
the new stuff we're looking to share? 
Thanks,

Dear_, 
It was lovely to meet you outside Kinnerton St the other day, although I think we may 
have met before sometime. 
I am booked to come to NYC on the 15th through the 21st of October and would be 
delighted if there might be a place for me to stay. 
Please let me know asap. 
I may also be coming to Paris this weekend and wondered if team Epstein will still be 
there?

Good evening-
As of this writing, Ms. Maxwell has not received legal mail which I 
personally placed in the 
East Building legal mailbox on Saturday, October 2. On that same day, 
in that same mailbox, 
I deposited legal mail for a client housed in the west building. That 
client confirmed that he received his legal mail. 
Ms. Maxwell has not. 
Please explain why delivery of Ms. Maxwell's mail has been delayed. 
Time is of the essence. Her trial begins on November 29th. 
Every delay caused by the MDC interferes with her ability to prepare 
for trial. 
Your prompt response is requested.

Hi 
As we're preparing our disclosures, we wanted to check with you about two things: 
• Did SDNY pay for flights for 
for the August 2019 hearing? What about the hotel? 
• Did SDNY pay for any travel related expenses for 
for the August 2019 hearing? What about 
the hotel? 
• When 
travelled here in September 2021, our understanding is that the office paid for her flights. 
Did the office pay for her hotel? We recall some correspondence about her booking her own hotel but wanted to 
confirm. 
Thanks!

Hi team, 
Draft letter attached. Please review for accuracy and let me know if you have any edits. I included the language about 
ere, but thought it might read a little strange here? We could otherwise have the paralegals include it in the 
3500 index in a footnote on the witness log document.

The report we discussed is attached. The first four pages concern activities in 2001-2002, but the reports that follow 
appear to have similar reference numbers through 2004, so I'm including for context in case that assists you in sorting this 
out tomorrow. The contact to reach out to is Sgt. 
. His work number is 
but if he said if you can't 
reach him on that number please call his personal number: 
We recognize you're still working out logistics for travel tomorrow morning, but whenever you have a sense of timing and 
which one of you will by flying out, please let us know when you can. 
Thanks,

Via email to: 
Re: 
Request for asset forfeiture of property acquired by Jeffrey Epstein to commit 
human trafficking in New Mexico at Zorro Ranch 
Acting United States Attorney M, 
Our office has provided investigative evidence regarding Jeffrey Epstein's use of the Zorro 
Ranch, located 
in Stanley, New Mexico, to assist federal prosecutors. In furtherance of 
achieving some measure of justice for victims of Epstein and his acolytes, I ask that any interests 
belonging to Epstein's estate or co-conspirators be seized by federal authorities. We believe that 
this ranch was used by Epstein and others to facilitate the commission and prolonged 
concealment of his trafficking of children, such that seizure may be pursued in conjunction with 
the pending criminal prosecution of Epstein's associates and co-conspirators. 
My priority is to assist federal prosecution efforts in identifying any and all assets used by 
Epstein and others in New Mexico to facilitate the commission and concealment of his crimes. 
To this end, we call upon your office to include the improvements of this property and any 
substitute assets as part of the civil forfeiture of property associated with any pending cases 
against Epstein's estate or involved with the criminal prosecution of his co-conspirators. 
In the event you need assistance investigating or eventually pursuing this avenue, I will gladly 
offer the resources my office has available to ensure that all survivors of crimes committed in 
New Mexico receive some measure of justice, closure, and eventual restitution.

IG, 
This was a blatant attempt to intimidate a whistleblower. "HE" (I think a male although very effeminate voice) 
was an anonymous, coward, scumbag who threatened me. AND then called me another 11/12 times after that. 
This is a VERY serious matter. Felony. I intend to see "him" prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Within 
weeks of filing a complaint against the SEC and you. 
I obviously have hit a nerve.

"If a company is a dark company and listed in the OTC market

be quoted or offered to retail investors," Redfearn said ...

See my comment letters on this subject. 
The SEC INTENTIONALLY puts the investing public at risk of frauds like this and thousands others like it. 
The core biz at NITE/VIRT,CDEL etc and the reason WHY the OTCM exists: Abusive naked shorting publicly

thank you for the kind words, and to express appreciation for your support of this investigation, not only in the 
initial Epstein prosecution but through the new angle on Maxwell and follow-up on other individuals as well. 
Everyone all the way up the chain has really cared about this the whole way through, and it was a team effort to 
work through the byzantine legal issues, the challenges with various witnesses, and all the other ancillary things 
that came up along the way. As one of the victim's counsel said to us recently, it has helped to right two wrongs -
- the initial wrong of what Epstein and Maxwell did, and the secondary wrong of how it was approached by the 
government the first time around. So, thank you again, and we're looking forward to the next stages.

from Jeffrey Epstein's devices for discovery in the Ghislaine Maxwell case. Thank you so much for being willing to help out

I found the discs and was able to match up some of them as containing the contents of discs whose labels were scanned 
into Relativity. But there are several that I cannot match up with the "CANNOT BE SCANNED" sheets on Relativity (this is 
primarily because several of the "CANNOT BE SCANED" sheets just say "1 CD" or "3 CDs" without any way of identifying 
what is on the unscanned CD). 
Is there a way to know which of these CDs were loaded onto Relativity and which were not? Any luck finding the index?

I actually found the answers to some of this morning's questions. They're a few emails below (but I'm including the chain 
for context). The answer from 
on the discs—the highlights below are her responses; you guys should have that 
email in your records as well—is that they did not extract the contents of the discs that were "scattered throughout" the 
boxes. They made copies of them, like actual digital copies, but did not extract them onto the DVDs that were the "scans" 
of the boxes. So those discs will still need to be extracted / uploaded to be reviewed. 
The one wrinkle on those discs is, keep in mind that we sent all the discs that 
Lave us to be unitized and uploaded 
to Relativity by our own vendor. So if it happens to be that what we sent to our vendor was (1) a bunch of discs that 
included scanned hard copies, and (2) some discs that were just copies of discs, our vendor may actually have solved this 
problem for us. I think the way to check that is to ask 
how those four-set-discs were labeled, and also to ask 
if there are any discs still in the boxes (if not, we've already had them scanned and uploaded to Relativity). I should 
say, I ave something due tomorrow so I'm in the office, so I just looked at the discs themselves, and to me there's no 
obvious way to check this on what we have — e.g., no discs are marked "1 of 4". 
I also asked at the time about any images that were not scanned, and she said at the time she would check on those and 
get back to us. She never did. The context to that is, I think, that this was all in mid- and late-July 2019. There then were a 
number of technical issues on getting the data from the DVDs sent by the FBI uploaded to Relativity, which went into the 
first week or so of Au ust. And then of course on August 10, our world changed, and we were no longer doing discovery. 
In any event, I'll email 
now on two questions: First, the discs that we supposedly received four copies of, how were 
they labeled (and are they included in the approximately 55 discs we received back, or were they put into the boxes with 
the hard copy files)? And second, the question of any hard copy documents they didn't scan. (And will also email 
andMo see where the boxes physically are now.) 
Obviously I don't have a vote, but personally, unless FBI did some very specific notations in the originals that are easily 
accessible, it's just 23 boxes — we could, and should, just send those boxes to a vendor now. They'd be back in your hands 
in a week or two, and you'd actually have everything you need.

!Pleat, 
thanks very much for all your and your team's work and for the update. That makes sense regarding the lAs, 
thanks. 
With respect to the images that were not scanned, is there any way to flag them in the original hard copies somehow, so 
that we can easily find them and refer to them when the hard copy documents are sent back to New York? Just to avoid 
needing to try to flip through all the original documents to find them. Let me check and see if a notation was made as to 
where these images were located or if I can readily/easily find them in output. 
Regarding the discs, I'm not sure I totally understand — when you say four copies each, were there just four discs total? Or 
possibly I'm just misunderstanding the explanation. And related, is it right that those discs were not processed (just 
copied) so we'll need to look at those separate for our review? Sorry I should have been clearer. We just copied the discs —
not processed and made four copies each which is our standard. The thought being when we burn output we always give 
a complete set that in theory would go to the defense, AUSA, and two copies to the Agent (one for him/and a back-up). 
The discs we found in the files contain pdfs (searchable), jpgs, gifs, and tif files 
And final question is just how all the scanned materials will be transmitted, so we can plan how most efficiently to receive 
them and get them processed here. We will send everything back to you on dvds. 
thanks again,

Good Afternoon! 
Here is the latest. We have finished scanning! 
In the course of going through the paper it was discovered that at some point in time (perhaps between 2013 and 2015 
when it was last digitized) three 1As failed to make it back into their respective file jackets. It's not clear what happened or 
who is at fault. I can tell you that we were able to conduct a search of our local network and retrieve the images. I spoke 
with our Field Evidence Unit who recommended that prior to inserting the images we create a cover sheet that reflected 
that the images were not a part of the "original" paper rather they were regenerated from a digital copy. The 1As in 
questions are 1A10, 1A28, 1A84 as well as two missing serials in 31E-MM-108062-al SEC 001 SER 1-45. My digital team is 
addressing this matter and has assured me I'll be able to burn the output first thing Monday so that we can get everything 
returned to you. 
A few other items to point out. There were some pornographic images of young girls. These were not imaged per our 
protocols. You As you review the content anywhere these images may have been you will see a DocLab kicksheet that 
states "possible child pornography" DO NOT SCAN. The original documents are still in their original location — they were 
just not scanned. 
EFTA00015213

Finally, there were a number of discs scattered throughout. We made physical copies — one for one ratio of each (four 
copies each) to go along with the physical paper scanned. These wil be sent along with the discs we will generate. 
Please let me know if you have any questions. I'll be in bright and early Monday morning.

I just wanted to give you a quick update. 
We finished inventorying all 22 boxes and released everything to DocLab last evening for scanning. As of this writing we 
are looking good for meeting the original deadline — give or take a day. We still have a few things to tweak, but I'm 
confident that things are looking good and we'll have this wrapped up within the next day or two. I'll send you a more

Thanks very much for the update - I think unless you guys can confirm that any prior scans were absolutely 100% done 
correctly (and separated by document, etc.), we'd prefer to have them just done in one full set now—particularly knowing 
that this will all be the subject of discovery, which definitely wouldn't have been the case in 2013.

Happy 4th of July Eve. We just received 22 boxes about 5 minutes ago. We discovered that the Miami Field Office had 
requested DocLab to scan a number of them back in 2013. I'm hoping (fingers crossed) that the images are available on 
our internal network so that I can access them and just simply reprocess the digital output, if not we'll re-prep and scan 
accordingly. We will keep you posted. 
Take care and have a great holiday.

We're under time pressure but I think the most important thing is that your folks have the time you need to do the job in 
a way you're comfortable with—being able to scan each document separately, dealing with any random scraps of paper,

I got the scan request thanks. 
How much wiggle room can I get on the deadline we originally talked about of 7/10? I'm concerned that with the boxes 
going from 15 to 22 and now not showing up until sometime tomorrow and Thursday a holiday the 10th is going to be 
extremely tight. Can I extend out at all to the 16th? If not I understand and we'll work to make it work somehow.

Plaintiffs, 
v. 
FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION, 
Defendant. 
Civil Action No. 1:17-cv-03956-PGG 
DECLARATION OF MICHAEL G. SEIDEL 
I, Michael G. Seidel, declare as follows: 
(1) 
I am the Section Chief of the Record/Information Dissemination Section 
("RIDS"), Information Management Division ("IMD"), Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI"), 
Winchester, Virginia. I joined the FBI in September 2011, and prior to my current position, I 
was the Acting Section Chief from May 26, 2020 to July 26, 2020; Assistant Section Chief of 
RIDS from June 2016 to May 25, 2020; Unit Chief, RIDS Litigation Support Unit from 
November 2012 to June 2016; and an Assistant General Counsel, FBI Office of General Counsel, 
Freedom of Information Act ("FOIA") Litigation Unit, from September 2011 to November 2012. 
In those capacities, I had management oversight or agency counsel responsibility for FBI FOIA 
and Privacy Act ("FOIPA") litigation cases nationwide. Prior to my joining the FBI, I served as 
a Senior Attorney, U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration ("DEA") from September 2006 to 
September 2011, where among myriad legal responsibilities, I advised on FOIPA matters and 
served as agency counsel representing the DEA in FOIPA suits nationwide. I also served as a

September 2006 culminating in my assignment as Chief, General Litigation Branch, U.S. Army 
Litigation Division where I oversaw FOIPA litigation for the U.S. Army. I am an attorney 
registered in the State of Ohio and the District of Columbia. 
(2) 
In my official capacity as Section Chief of RIDS, I supervise approximately 237 
FBI employees, supported by approximately 91 contractors, who staff a total of ten (10) FBI 
Headquarters ("FBIHQ") units and two (2) field operational service center units whose collective 
mission is to effectively plan, develop, direct, and manage responses to requests for access to 
FBI records and information pursuant to the FOIA as amended by the OPEN Government Act of 
2007, the OPEN FOIA Act of 2009, and the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016; the Privacy Act of 
1974; Executive Order 13,526; Presidential, Attorney General, and FBI policies and procedures; 
judicial decisions; and Presidential and Congressional directives. The statements contained in 
this declaration are based upon my personal knowledge, upon information provided to me in my 
official capacity, and upon conclusions and determinations reached and made in accordance 
therewith. 
(3) 
Because of the nature of my official duties, I am familiar with the procedures 
followed by the FBI in responding to requests for information from its files pursuant to the 
provisions of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. § 552, and the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. § 552a. 
Specifically, I am aware of the FBI's handling of Plaintiff James Robertson's FOIA request for 
records related to the FBI's investigation and prosecution of financier Jeffrey Edward Epstein. 
In response to Plaintiff's request, the FBI processed on a document-by-document basis a total of 
11,571 pages of responsive records. Of these pages, the FBI released 181 pages in full, released 
1,051 pages in part, and withheld 10,339 pages in full for the following reasons: the information 
in those pages was exempt from disclosure pursuant to one or more applicable FOIA

Exemption(s); the pages were found to be duplicative of other pages accounted for elsewhere in 
the FBI's production; and/or the pages are sealed pursuant to United States Court order and thus 
unavailable for release through the FOIA. In addition to the 11,571 processed pages, the FBI 
also categorically withheld additional records pursuant to Exemption 7(A). See infra FN 7.

In accordance with Vaughn v. Rosen, 424 F.2d 820 (D.C. Cir. 1973), this 
declaration is being submitted in support of Defendant's motion for summary judgment, and 
provides the Court with a summary of the administrative history of Plaintiff's request; the 
procedures used to search for, review, and process responsive records; the FBI's justification for 
withholding information in part or in full pursuant to FOIA Exemptions 3, 5, 6, 7(A), 7(C), 7(D), 
and 7(E), 5 U.S.C. §§ 552(b)(3), (b)(5), (b)(6), (b)(7)(A), (bX7)(C), (b)(7)(D), and (b)(7)(E); and

BACKGROUND INFORMATION CONCERNING JEFFREY EDWARD EPSTEIN 
(5) 
In June 2008, Jeffrey Epstein pled guilty to a criminal charge of procuring 
prostitution of a minor. Epstein served 13 months of his 18-month sentence. On July 2, 2019, 
Jeffrey Epstein was indicted by a federal grand jury in the United States District Court for the 
Southern District of New York on one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking, in violation 
of 18 U.S.C. § 371, and one count of sex trafficking, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591(a), (b)(2), 
and 2. United States v. Epstein, No. 19 Cr. 490 (RMB) (S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. No. 2. Based on the

By electronic FOIA ("eFOIA")1 dated April 20, 2017, Plaintiff Robertson 
submitted a FOIPA request to the FBI seeking "all documents relating to the FBI's investigation 
and prosecution of financier Jeffrey Edward Epstein . . ." Additionally, he requested a fee 
waiver and expedited processing. (Ex. A.) 
(7) 
By letter dated April 28, 2017, the FBI acknowledged receipt of Plaintiff's FOIA 
request, and notified Plaintiff it had assigned his request FBI FOIPA Request Number 1372398-
000. The FBI informed Plaintiff that, because he requested information on one or more third 
party individuals, the FBI would neither confirm nor deny the existence of such records pursuant 
to FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7(C), 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(6) and (b)(7)(C). The FBI's response 
explained that the mere acknowledgement of the existence of FBI records on third party 
individuals could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal 
privacy. Additionally, the FBI advised it was closing Plaintiffs' request. The FBI instructed 
Plaintiff to visit www.fbi.gov, select "Services," "Information Management," and "Freedom of 
Information/Privacy Act" for more information about making requests for records on third party 
individuals (living or deceased). Finally, the FBI informed Plaintiffs they could appeal the FBI's 
response to the DOJ, Office of Information Policy ("OIP") within ninety (90) days of its letter, 
contact the FBI's public liaison, and or seek dispute resolution services by contacting the Office 
of Government Information Services ("OGIS"). (Ex. B.)

remaining responsive documents, at a rate of no less than 500 per month, and cited all applicable 
underlying exemptions. The FBI withheld in full all remaining responsive records pursuant to 
FOIA Exemption 7(A). Information in those records was also withheld pursuant to FOIA

By letter dated January 31, 2020, the FBI released additional responsive records 
Jeffrey Epstein was arrested on July 6, 2019, on federal charges for the sex trafficking of 
minors. RIDS reached out to an Assistant United States Attorney in SDNY, who confirmed that 
additional release of responsive material could negatively impact the pending prosecution. With 
this new development—a re-opened investigation—the further release of any responsive records 
was now reasonably anticipated to cause harm to the ongoing enforcement proceedings; thus, 
Exemption 7(A) became a properly asserted exemption claim over all previously protected 
information. 
During a categorical review, the FBI reviews each document and determines if the release of 
the documents would interfere with ongoing law enforcement proceedings. If processing a 
document for release could interfere with any law enforcement proceeding, the FOIA analyst 
will assert Exemption 7(A) and all underlying exemptions. This review process is explained in 
detail in 9¶ 65-75 infra. 
The FBI began processing documents in response to Plaintiffs' request long before Mr. Epstein 
was arrested in 2019. When Mr. Epstein's arrest and the ongoing investigation became public in 
July 2019, the FBI began to assert Exemption 7(B) given that (1) a trial or adjudication was 
pending or truly imminent and (2) it was more probable than not that disclosure of the records 
would seriously interfere with the fairness of those proceedings. Mr. Epstein's death on August 
10, 2019, arguably negated the application of Exemption 7(B). However, the records withheld 
pursuant to Exemption 7(B) were additionally withheld pursuant to Exemptions 3, 6, 7(A), 7(C), 
and 7(D), and remain properly withheld despite Mr. Epstein's death.

THE FBI'S CENTRAL RECORDS SYSTEM 
(32) 
The Central Records System ("CRS") is an extensive system of records consisting 
of applicant, investigative, intelligence, personnel, administrative, and general files compiled and 
maintained by the FBI in the course of fulfilling its integrated missions and functions as a law 
enforcement, counterterrorism, and intelligence agency to include performance of administrative 
and personnel functions. The CRS spans the entire FBI organization and encompasses the 
records of FBI Headquarters ("FBIHQ"), FBI Field Offices, and FBI Legal Attaché Offices 
("Legats") worldwide. 
(33) 
The CRS consists of a numerical sequence of files, called FBI "classifications," 
which are organized according to designated subject categories. The broad array of CRS file 
classification categories include types of criminal conduct and investigations conducted by the 
FBI, as well as categorical subjects pertaining to counterterrorism, intelligence, 
counterintelligence, personnel, and administrative matters. For identification and retrieval 
purposes across the FBI, when a case file is opened, it is assigned a Universal Case File Number 
("UCFN") consisting of three sequential components: (a) the CRS file classification number, (b) 
the abbreviation of the FBI Office of Origin ("OO") initiating the file, and (c) the assigned 
individual case file number for that particular subject matter.? Within each case file, pertinent 
documents of interest are "serialized," or assigned a document number in the order which the 
For example, in a fictitious file number of "I I Z-HQ-56789;" the "I IZ" component indicates 
the file classification, "HQ" indicates that FBI Headquarters is the FBI 00 of the file, and 
"56789"is the assigned case specific file number.

document is added to the file, typically in chronological order. 
THE CRS GENERAL INDICES AND INDEXING 
(34) 
The general indices to the CRS are the index or "key" to locating records within 
the enormous amount of information contained in the CRS. The CRS is indexed in a manner 
which meets the FBI's investigative needs and priorities and allows FBI personnel to reasonably 
and adequately locate pertinent files in the performance of their law enforcement duties. The 
general indices are arranged in alphabetical order and comprise an index on a variety of subject 
matters to include individuals, organizations, events, or other subjects of investigative interest 
that are indexed for future retrieval. The entries in the general indices fall into two category 
types: 
A. Main entry. A main index entry is a created for each individual or non-individual 
that is the subject or focus of an investigation. The main subject(s) are identified 
in the case title of most documents in a file. 
B. Reference entry. A reference index entry is created for individuals or non-
individuals associated with the case but are not the main subject(s) or focus of an 
investigation. Reference subjects are typically not identified in the case title of a 
file.

FBI employees may index information in the CRS by individual (persons), by 
organization (organizational entities, places, and things), and by event (e.g., a terrorist attack or 
bank robbery). Indexing information in the CRS is done at the discretion of FBI investigators 
when information is deemed of sufficient significance to warrant indexing for future retrieval. 
Accordingly, the FBI does not index every individual name or other subject matter in the general 
indices. 
AUTOMATED CASE SUPPORT 
(36) 
Automated Case Support ("ACS") was an electronic, integrated case management 
system that became effective for FBIHQ and all FBI Field Offices and Legats on October 1,

1995. As part of the ACS implementation process, over 105 million CRS records were 
converted from automated systems previously utilized by the FBI into a single, consolidated case 
management system accessible by all FBI offices. ACS had an operational purpose and design 
to enable the FBI to locate, retrieve, and maintain information in its files in the performance of 
its myriad missions and functions.8
(37) 
The Universal Index ("UNI") was the automated index of the CRS and provided 
all offices of the FBI a centralized, electronic means of indexing pertinent investigative 
information to FBI files for future retrieval via index searching. Individual names were recorded 
with applicable identifying information such as date of birth, race, sex, locality, Social Security 
Number, address, and/or date of an event. Moreover, ACS implementation built upon and 
incorporated prior automated FBI indices; therefore, a search employing the UNI application of 
ACS encompassed data that was already indexed into the prior automated systems superseded by 
ACS. As such, a UNI index search in ACS was capable of locating FBI records created before 
its 1995 FBI-wide implementation in both paper and electronic fonnat.9
ACS AND SENTINEL 
(38) 
Sentinel is the FBI's next generation case management system that became 
effective FBI-wide on July 1, 2012. Sentinel provides a web-based interface to FBI users, and it 
includes the same automated applications that were utilized in ACS. After July 1, 2012, all FBI 
ACS was, and the next generation Sentinel system is, relied upon by the FBI daily to fulfill 
essential functions such as conducting criminal, counterterrorism, and national security 
investigations; background investigations; citizenship and employment queries, and security 
screening, to include Presidential protection. 
Older CRS records that were not indexed into UNI as a result of the 1995 ACS consolidation 
remain searchable by manual review of index cards, known as the "manual indices."

generated records are created electronically in case files via Sentinel; however, Sentinel did not 
replace ACS and its relevance as an important FBI search mechanism. Just as pertinent 
information was indexed into UNI for records generated in ACS before July 1, 2012, when a 
record is generated in Sentinel, information is indexed for future retrieval. 
(39) 
On August 1, 2018, the ACS case management system was decommissioned and 
ACS data was migrated into Sentinel including the ACS indices data and digitized investigative 
records formerly available in ACS. Moreover, Sentinel retains the index search methodology 
and function whereby the CRS is queried via Sentinel for pertinent indexed main or reference 
entries in case files. All CRS index data from the UNI application previously searched via ACS 
is now searched through the "ACS Search" function within Sentinel. 
(40) 
Upon receipt of FOIPA requests where the subject matter predates the 
implementation of Sentinel, RIDS predominately begins its FOIPA searching efforts by 
conducting index searches via the "ACS Search" function in Sentinel. RIDS then builds on its 
ACS index search by conducting an index search of Sentinel records to ensure it captures all 
relevant data indexed after the implementation of Sentinel. The CRS automated indices, 
available within Sentinel and the ACS search function in Sentinel, in most cases represent the 
most reasonable means for the FBI to locate records potentially responsive to FOIPA requests. 
This is because these automated indices offer access to a comprehensive, agency-wide set of 
indexed data on a wide variety of investigative and administrative subjects. Currently, these 
automated indices consist of millions of searchable records and are updated daily with material 
newly indexed in Sentinel. 
(41) 
However, the location of records indexed to the subject of a FOIPA request does 
not automatically mean the indexed records are responsive to the subject. Index searches are the

means by which potentially responsive records are located, but ultimately, a FOIPA analyst must 
consider potentially responsive indexed records against the specific parameters of individual 
requests. Responsiveness determinations are made once indexed records are gathered, analyzed, 
and sorted by FOIPA analysts, who then review the records to determine which are responsive to 
an individual request. 
ADEQUACY OF SEARCH 
(42) 
Scope of Search and Results. RIDS conducted a search reasonably calculated to 
locate records responsive to Plaintiffs' request, specifically "documents relating to FBI's 
investigation and prosecution of financier Jeffrey Edward Epstein .. . ." Prior to conducting a 
search of the CRS, and particularly in matters of heightened public interest, RIDS typically 
conducts a preliminary search of the FOIA Document Processing System ("FDPS") to determine 
if a subject has been previously requested or is currently being processed in response to another 
request. This helps to avoid duplication of efforts and is an efficient means of getting more 
records to more requesters, while conserving RIDS limited resources. As a result of the FBI's 
search of FDPS, RIDS located documents responsive to Plaintiffs' request in a first-party FOIPA 
request1 ' made on behalf of Jeffrey Epstein, which had been identified by an index search of the 
CRS. The documents responsive to Epstein's FOIPA were also responsive to the Plaintiffs' 
request; they had already been retrieved at the time RIDS did its inquiry and processing of those 
records was underway. To ensure all responsive records were located from within the CRS, 
RIDS conducted a supplemental search utilizing the search term "Jeffrey Epstein", and no 
additional records were located responsive to Plaintiffs' request.

to November 25, 2012, on Jeffrey Epstein.

JUSTIFICATION FOR NONDISCLOSURE UNDER THE FOIA 
(43) 
The FBI began processing documents in response to Plaintiffs' request long 
before Mr. Epstein was arrested in 2019. Therefore, the FBI initially processed the records 
without reference to an ongoing investigation. After Mr. Epstein's arrest and the ongoing 
investigation became public in July 2019, the FBI began to assert Exemption 7(A) with respect 
to withheld information. In addition, the FBI asserted Exemption 7(A) over all information that 
had been withheld under other exemptions prior to that date, as noted in footnote 5, supra. Thus, 
while Exemption 7(A) was not included on the face of the documents that were processed and 
released in part prior to July 2019, it has been added to the index for all such documents. See 
Exhibit EE. As to those records that warranted categorical denial after the arrest of Mr. Epstein 
in July 2019, the review is more fully explained in paragraphs 67 through 79, infra. 
(44) 
The FBI processed all documents responsive to Plaintiffs' request to achieve 
maximum disclosure consistent with the access provisions of the FOIA. Every effort was made 
to provide Plaintiffs with all material in the public domain and with all reasonably segregable, 
non-exempt information. The FBI did not withhold any reasonably segregable, nonexempt 
portions from Plaintiffs. Further description of the information withheld, beyond what is 
provided in this declaration, could identify the actual exempt information protected by the FBI. 
The FBI Bates-stamped all pages that it processed prior to July 2019 consecutively as "03956-1 
through 03956-11571." These records are referred to in this declaration collectively as the 
Bates-stamped or Bates-numbered records.' I On the pages released in full or in part, these 
" In contrast, records processed after July 2019 were not Bates-stamped, as those records were 
subject to categorical withholding per Exemption 7(A). Thus, when I refer to the Bates-
numbered records, I am not including the records processed after July 2019 that were subject to 
categorical withholding. Those records, which will sometimes be referred to collectively as the 
categorically withheld records, are more fully addressed in q¶ 67 through 79, infra.

numbers are typically located at the bottom of each page. Attached to this declaration as Exhibit 
EE is an index of the Bates-stamped records that have been withheld in full or in part, with an 
explanation of the basis for each withholding.12
(45) 
Additionally, with respect to the Bates-stamped records, the FBI further 
categorized its application of exemptions to provide additional detail regarding the nature of the 
information withheld. Specifically, the FBI applied numerical codes that coincide with various 
categories of exempt information. These coded categories are provided to aid the Court's and 
Plaintiffs' review of the FBI's explanations of the FOIA exemptions it has asserted to withhold 
the material. The uses of these codes, together with the information provided in this declaration, 
demonstrate that all material withheld by the FBI is exempt from disclosure pursuant to the cited 
FOIA exemptions, or is so intertwined with protected material that segregation is not possible 
without revealing the underlying protected material. 
(46) 
Each instance of information withheld pursuant to a FOIA Exemption is 
accompanied by a coded designation that corresponds to the categories listed below. For 
example, if "(b)(7)(C)-1" appears on a document, the "(b)(7)(C)" designation refers to FOIA 
Exemption 7(C) protecting against unwarranted invasions of personal privacy. The numerical 
designation of "1" following the "(b)(7)(C)" narrows the main category into a more specific 
subcategory, such as "Names and Identifying Information of Third Parties of Investigative 
Interest." 
FBI provided Plaintiffs a draft copy of the index. After the index was shared with Plaintiffs, 
FBI discovered a number of documents that were stamped with previously-used Bates numbers. 
As a result, the documents that were previously Bates-stamped 03956-10980 through 03956-
11029 have been renumbered to 03956-11522 through 03956-11571. Exhibit EE has been edited 
to reflect the corrected Bates-numbers.

EXEMPTION 3 - INFORMATION PROTECTED BY STATUTE 
(48) 
U.S.C. § 552 (b)(3) exempts from disclosure information which is: 
specifically exempted from disclosure by statute . . . if that statute (A)(i) requires 
that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no 
discretion on the issue; or (A)(ii) establishes particular criteria for withholding or 
refers to particular types of matters to be withheld; and (B) if enacted after the date 
of enactment of the Open FOIA Act of 2009, specifically cites to this paragraph. 
(b)(3)-1: Child Victims' and Child Witnesses' Rights Act, 18 US.C. § 3509 
(49) 
In Exemption category (b)(3)-1, the FBI protected information pertaining to child 
victims and witnesses. The privacy protection measures enacted in 1990, within the Child 
Victims' and Child Witnesses' Rights Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3509, were created to protect minor 
children involved in criminal proceedings. This statute was enacted well before the Open FOIA 
Act of 2009. Moreover, it refers to particular types of matters that must be withheld from public 
disclosure. Specifically, 18 U.S.C. § 3509(d) protects from disclosure certain records containing 
identifying information pertaining to children involved in criminal proceedings. A child is 
defined in 18 U.S.C. § 3509(a)(2) as "a person who is under the age of 18, who is or is alleged to 
be (A) a victim of a crime of physical abuse, sexual abuse, or exploitation; or (B) a witness to a 
crime committed against another person." Accordingly, the FBI asserted Exemption 3, at times 
in conjunction with Exemptions 6, 7(C) and 7(D), to protect names, images, and identifying 
information of minor children victims and witnesses within the child prostitution investigation of

Jeffrey Epstein. 
(b)(3)-2: Federal Grand Jury Infonnation — Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure (6)(e) 
(50) 
In Exemption category (b)(3)-2, the FBI protected Federal Grand Jury 
information pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e). As relevant to 5 U.S.C. § 
552(b)(3)(B), Rule 6(e) is a statute14 enacted before the date of enactment of the OPEN FOIA 
Act of 2009.15 It is well-established that Rule 6(e) embodies a broad, sweeping policy of 
preserving the secrecy of grand jury material regardless of the substance in which the material is 
contained. Records responsive to Plaintiffs' request details matters occurring before one or more 
federal grand juries empaneled in relation to the investigations at issue. Specifically, the 
investigative files contain information about the names of recipients of federal grand jury 
subpoenas; information that identifies specific records subpoenaed by a federal grand jury; and 
copies of specific records provided pursuant to federal grand jury subpoenas. Wherever the FBI 
protected this information, it found a clear nexus to federal grand jury proceedings on the face of 
the responsive documents. Any disclosure of this information would clearly violate the secrecy 
of the grand jury proceedings and could reveal the inner workings of a federal grand jury. Thus, 
the FBI properly withheld this information pursuant to Exemption 3, in conjunction with Rule 
As prescribed by 18 U.S.C. § 3771 (subsequently repealed by Pub.L. 100-702, Title IV, § 
404(a)(1) (Nov. 19, 1988) and replaced by 28 U.S.C. § 2074), proposed rules become effective 
ninety days after the Chief Justice reports them to Congress. By order of April 26, 1976, the 
Supreme Court adopted amendments to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure which included 
Rule 6(e) and reported the amendments to Congress. Congress voted to delay the effective date 
of several of the proposed rules, to include Rule 6(e), "until August 1, 1977, or until and to the 
extent approved by Act of Congress, whichever is earlier." Pub. L. No. 94-349 § 1, 90 Stat. 822

6(e). 
(b)(3)-3: Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Act — 18 U.S.C. § 5038 
(51) 
The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Act, 18 U.S.C. § 5038, protects from 
disclosure all information and records relating to any juvenile delinquency proceeding, unless the 
release is necessary to meet certain circumstances described within the statute. This statute was 
enacted before the Open FOIA Act of 2009, but meets the standards of 5 U.S.C. 552 § (A)(ii) as 
it establishes particular criteria for withholding and describes particular types of matters to be 
withheld. The records at issue here contain arrest information and criminal history of third party 
juveniles. Plaintiffs' request does not meet the specific circumstances set forth in the statute for 
disclosure; therefore, the records are properly withheld pursuant to Exemption category (b)(3)-3. 
Additionally, the FBI also asserted Exemptions 6 and 7(C) over all information that falls within 
this category. 
EXEMPTION 5 — PRIVILEGED INFORMATION 
(52) 
FOIA Exemption 5 has been construed to exempt documents or information 
normally privileged in the civil discovery context and incorporates the deliberative process 
privilege and attorney work product doctrine. In order to apply Exemption 5, agencies must first 
satisfy the threshold requirement — i.e., show that the information protected consists of "inter-
agency or intra-agency" information. Once the threshold is satisfied, agencies must satisfy the 
elements of the pertinent privilege. (b)(5)-1: Deliberative Process Privilege 
(53) 
In Exemption Category (b)(5)-1, the FBI protected privileged, deliberative 
materials. The deliberative process privilege protects predecisional, deliberative 
communications that are part of a process by which agency decisions are made. It therefore 
encompasses opinions, advice, evaluations, deliberations, analyses, proposals, or

Deliberative Process/Attorney-Client/Attorney Work Product Privileged 
recommendations that form part of an agency decision-making process. The privilege also 
protects records and information that if disclosed, would reveal the agency's collection of 
multitudinous facts, and the selection, sorting, evaluation, and analysis of those facts relied upon 
as part of the decision-making process. Agencies must show that the withheld information was 
both predecisional — i.e., antecedent to a final agency decision — and deliberative — i.e., part of 
the process in which the agency engaged in an effort to reach a final decision (whether or not any 
final decision was ever reached). 
(54) 
Exemption 5, when asserted in conjunction with the deliberative process 
privilege, is predicated on the recognition that release of this privileged information would 
inhibit the government's development of policy and stifle its decision-making process. 
Furthermore, exempting such documents from disclosure also protects against public confusion 
that might result from preliminary disclosure of opinions and information that do not, in fact, 
reflect the final views or policies of the FBI. The exemption and privilege together protect not 
only documents but also the integrity of the deliberative process itself where exposure of the 
process would result in harm. The FBI invokes Exemption 5 and the deliberative process 
privilege because FBI employees would hesitate to offer their candid and conscientious opinions 
to superiors or coworkers if they knew that their opinions of the moment might be made a matter 
of public record at some future date, and because such self-censorship would, in turn, degrade 
the quality of agency decisions by depriving the decision-makers of fully-explored options 
developed from robust debate. 
(55) 
As described in more detail below, the FBI relied on Exemption 5 and the 
deliberative process privilege to protect internal deliberative communications and draft 
documents. These materials reflect deliberations integral to reaching final agency decisions or

were key to a decision-making process aimed at developing policy/best agency decisions. The 
communications and drafts are deliberative and pre-decisional. Additionally, as contemplated by 
the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016, all of the protected material was created less than 25 years 
before the submission of Plaintiff's request. 
Deliberative Communications 
(56) 
The FBI asserted Exemption 5 to withhold deliberative communications. These 
communications contain or consist of material related to deliberations by DOJ employees who 
are making proposals and/or working to come to a consensus on final agency decisions. 
Specifically, this material includes FBI and the United States Attorney ("AUSA") discussions on 
the handling of Jeffrey Epstein's asset forfeiture and his pending indictment. The material 
protected is pre-decisional in that it discusses proposed actions and considerations and does not 
reflect final agency decisions. The harm in release here would be a chilling effect on agency 
employees' willingness to share raw, unrefined ideas and candid feedback should they know it 
could become subject to public disclosure. Release could set a dangerous precedent as the FBI 
would be seen as unwilling to shield its employees' deliberations from public scrutiny and could 
result in hesitancy to participate fully in such deliberations by FBI employees during future 
deliberations. Additionally, release of this material would create public confusion as this 
material predates final agency decisions. It could potentially cast doubt on the accuracy of 
actual, final agency decisions/policies or cause public misunderstanding as to what are the actual 
FBI policies/decisions. 
Draft Materials 
(57) 
The FBI also asserted Exemption 5 to withhold draft documents that are clearly 
marked as strictly confidential, draft for discussions only. These draft documents are legal

Deliberative Process/Attorney-Client/Attorney Work Product Privileged 
documents created during the prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein and are inherently part of the 
deliberative process. They predate final agency decisions and reflect the give-and-take of 
deliberations, through the editing process, which leads to final, refined products. In the instances 
where the FBI withheld draft material pursuant to Exemption 5, the FBI found the draft material 
was shared between FBI and DOJ, was pre-decisional, was deliberative (the material was shared 
to solicit feedback/edits), and release could potentially harm agency deliberations. The harm 
here would be a chilling effect on agency employees' willingness to share such drafts if they 
knew their unrefined ideas would be subject to public disclosure. Furthermore, there would be a 
risk of public confusion in that these drafts do not reflect final agency decisions. 
(58) 
For the reasons discussed above, the FBI properly protected two types of 
deliberative materials described under Exemption 5, in conjunction with the deliberative process 
privilege. The FBI endeavored to segregate non-deliberative facts, whenever possible, and only 
withheld such material when it found it was inextricably intertwined with agency deliberations. 
(b)(5)-2: Attorney Work Product Privilege 
(59) 
In Exemption category (b)(5)-2, the FBI protected information subject to the 
attorney work product doctrine. The attorney work product privilege protects such tangible and 
intangible items as interviews, memoranda, correspondence, mental impressions, and personal 
beliefs prepared or developed by an attorney, or at the direction of an attorney, in reasonable 
anticipation of litigation. The privilege is predicated on the recognition that proper preparation 
of a case depends on an attorney's ability to assemble information, sort relevant from irrelevant 
facts, and prepare his/her legal theories and strategies without intrusive or needless scrutiny. 
(60) 
The FBI relied on the attorney work product privilege to protect inter-agency 
materials created at the direction of an attorney in reasonable anticipation of litigation.

Specifically, the FBI protected information regarding legal strategy and evidence gathering 
conducted by the FBI SAs assigned to the criminal investigation into activities of Jeffrey 
Epstein, at the direction of an AUSA, in March 2007. This guidance and documents compiled, 
provides details of the AUSA's prosecutorial strategy and the inner workings of how the AUSA 
planned to build the legal framework to support an indictment of Jeffrey Epstein. This 
information satisfies Exemption 5's threshold of being inter-agency because these records were 
exchanged within Department of Justice (i.e., between the FBI and U.S. Attorney's Office). 
Furthermore, these records are quintessential attorney work products and readily satisfy the 
elements of the attorney work product privilege because they were created for an attorney 
working to build a legal case to seek indictment and prosecution of a child prostitution criminal 
case. As described supra, release of this type of information would interfere with the 
government attorney's ability to properly prepare their legal theories and strategies and hinder 
them in providing the best possible representation of their clients [the government]. Finally, 
because the attorney work product privilege protects both factual and deliberative material, 
segregation is not required. Accordingly, the FBI properly withheld this information pursuant to 
Exemption 5. 
EXEMPTION 7 THRESHOLD 
(61) 
Before an agency can invoke any of the harms enumerated in Exemption (b)(7), it 
must first demonstrate that the records or information at issue were compiled for law 
enforcement purposes. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 533, 534, and Executive Order 12,333 as 
implemented by the Attorney General's Guidelines for Domestic FBI Operations (AGG-DOM) 
and 28 CFR § 0.85, the FBI is the primary investigative agency of the federal government with 
authority and responsibility to investigate all violations of federal law not exclusively assigned

to another agency, to conduct investigations and activities to protect the United States and its 
people from terrorism and threats to national security, and further the foreign intelligence 
objectives of the United States. Under this investigative authority, the responsive records herein 
were compiled in furtherance of the FBI's investigation of criminal child prostitution involving 
Jeffrey Epstein. As these records were compiled as part of the FBI's investigation of potential 
federal crimes, they were compiled for law enforcement purposes. 
EXEMPTION 7(A) 
PENDING LAW ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS

U.S.C. § 552 (bX7)(A) exempts from disclosure: 
records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but 
only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement

information could reasonably be expected to interfere with the enforcement proceeding. Often, 
the FBI asserts Exemption 7(A) categorically to withhold a variety of different documents in an 
investigative file, which the FBI then groups into functional categories and describes in greater 
detail. In this case, however, the FBI asserted Exemption 7(A) to protect the ongoing 
prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein and then later, of his potential co-conspirators. The release of this 
information would reveal unknown information concerning pending enforcement procedures. 
The FBI determined release of any of this material would provide criminals with information 
about the government's investigation/enforcement strategies in ongoing matters, allow them to 
predict and potentially thwart these strategies, and/or allow them to discover/tamper with 
witnesses and/or destroy evidence. As such, revealing this information could reasonably be

PROCESSING OF RECORDS AFTER ARREST OF MR. EPSTEIN ON JULY 6, 2019 
Types of Documents Categorically Denied Pursuant to FOIA Exemption 7(A)

Providing a document-by-document description or listing of the records 
responsive to Plaintiff's request falling in the categorically denied records would undermine the 
very interests that the FBI seeks to protect under Exemption (b)(7)(A), in addition to the other 
exemptions identified below. In order to protect these interests, the FBI has described the types 
of responsive records from the pending investigative files, which are being withheld in full 
pursuant to FOIA Exemption (bX7)(A). The pending investigative files contain the following 
types of documents: 
(a) FD-105716 - Electronic Communication ("EC"): FD-1057s and ECs replaced the 
traditional FBI correspondence (i.e., Memoranda and Letters) as the primary vehicle 
of correspondence within the FBI. The purpose of an EC is to communicate within 
the FBI in a consistent format that can be uploaded by the originating Division or 
office, transmitted, and downloaded by recipient Divisions or offices within the FBI's 
internal computer network. These forms are often utilized to record and disseminate 
intelligence/investigative information and for general investigation administration 
purposes. 
The designation "FD-" is attached to forms created and utilized internally by the FBI.

(b) Interview Forms (FD-302): FD-302s are internal FBI forms in which evidence is 
often documented, usually as a result of FBI interviews. Such evidence and/or 
interview information may later be used as testimony or evidence in court 
proceedings/trials. Additionally, these evidence/interview forms are often 
incorporated in other FBI documents that may be used to disseminate 
intelligence/investigative information and can be utilized to set leads in furtherance of 
the FBI's investigative efforts. 
(c) Handwritten Interview Notes: These are the original handwritten notes of FBI 
personnel who conducted interviews in the course of FBI investigations. These notes 
are almost always transposed into FD-302s and are utilized by the FBI in the same 
manner. 
(d) State and Local Law Enforcement Documents: This category consists of documents 
provided to the FBI by state and local law enforcement agencies. These documents 
can be used as evidence in court proceedings, are often incorporated in other FBI 
documents that may be used to disseminate intelligence/investigative information, 
and can be utilized to set leads in furtherance of the FBI's investigative efforts. 
(e) Documents Implementing Sensitive Investigative Techniques: These documents were 
utilized to implement a specific, sensitive, investigative technique. Describing these 
documents further would reveal this technique or sensitive data concerning this 
technique.

(g) FD-340, IA Envelopes: These envelopes are used to organize and store documents 
that need to be stored separately from the FBI file to which they are attached, due to 
their size. They usually contain handwritten notes of interviews, photographs, and 
other various evidentiary documents. 
(h) Other Investigative Documents: The FBI uses various types of forms throughout a 
criminal investigation that do not fit into an official government format. Documents 
included in this category may include, but is not limited to, storage envelopes, bulky 
exhibit cover sheets, transmittal forms (e.g., facsimile cover sheets), letters, and 
routing slips. Additionally, this category consists of various types of documents 
reflecting information and evidence gathered during an FBI investigation, the sources 
from/by which such information and evidence was gathered, methods used to obtain 
the information and evidence, and methods used to analyze the information and 
evidence. To describe these investigative documents in this category any more 
specifically would reveal the scope of the FBI's investigations, as well as the sources 
and methods being utilized by the FBI.

The FBI has reviewed and categorized the types of exempt records into three 
categories - Evidentiary/Investigative Materials, Administrative Materials and Public 
Source/Non-Investigative Harm Materials. The categories will be discussed in more detail 
below. 
(66) 
A record can fall into one or more functional categories as described in the below 
paragraphs. For example, a record, such as an FBI Investigative Report, may serve several 
purposes and may contain multiple categories of information, such as witness statements, 
administrative directions, and/or evidentiary materials. Therefore, the information in each record 
could be included in multiple categories. 
Category 1: Evidentiary/Investigative Materials 
(67) 
This category includes copies of records or evidence, analyses of evidence, and 
derivative communications discussing or incorporating evidence. A derivative communication 
describes, verbatim or in summary, the contents of the original record, how it was obtained, and 
how it relates to the investigation. Other derivative communications report this information to 
other FBI field offices, other law enforcement agencies, or other Federal agencies, either to 
advise them about the progress of the investigation, or to elicit their assistance in handling 
investigative leads. The following subparagraphs describe the types of evidentiary materials in 
the responsive records and the anticipated harm that could reasonably result from the release of 
the materials. 
(68) 
Confidential Witness Statements: Confidential witness statements are one of the 
principal tools used in proving the facts which form the basis for a prosecution. These 
statements contain information obtained from confidential witnesses who have knowledge of the 
criminal activities that resulted in the investigation. If the FBI were to release this information,

the witnesses that have chosen to cooperate with law enforcement could be subjected to 
retaliation, intimidation, or physical or mental harm. This could have a chilling effect on the 
future prosecution of this case inasmuch as potential witnesses might fear exposure and reprisals 
from the subjects of this investigation. Implicit in conducting interviews in an investigation of 
this nature is the notion that an individual's identity and the information provided by them will 
be afforded confidentiality. The FBI goes to great lengths to protect and maintain an individual's 
confidentiality since it is an integral part of a successful investigation and prosecution. The 
release of witness statements would disrupt and harm potential investigative and/or prosecutorial 
actions. 
(69) 
Exchange of Information between FBI and Local Law Enforcement Agencies: 
Release of information exchanged between the FBI and its local law enforcement partners would 
disclose evidence, investigative information, and criminal intelligence developed by various 
agencies that have cooperated with—and provided information and records to—the FBI in this 
ongoing investigation. Release of information would identify the investigative interest of 
particular individuals; identify and tip off individuals who are of interest to law enforcement; and 
provide suspects or targets the opportunity to destroy evidence and/or alter their behavior to 
avoid detection. 
Category 2: Administrative Materials 
(70) 
Materials falling within this category include items such as case captions, 
identities of FBI field offices, dates of investigations, and detailed instructions designed to 
ensure that investigative procedures are conducted within the appropriate FBI and DOJ 
guidelines. The following subparagraphs describe the types of administrative materials 
contained in the files and the anticipated harms that could reasonably result from the disclosure

of such materials in the midst of this ongoing investigation, and prior to any prospective 
prosecutions. In many instances, administrative information is contained at the beginning or end 
of correspondence or documents that fall within other categories of documents; therefore, to 
release details on this category of information would also reveal the investigative interests of the 
FBI and could enable suspects to discern a "road map" of the investigation. 
(71) 
Reporting Communications: These communications permit an agency to monitor 
the progress of the investigation and to facilitate its conduct. These communications have the 
potential to reveal or confirm the cooperation of other local or state government agencies in this 
investigation. These communications are replete with detailed information about the FBI's 
investigative activities as well as detailed information about potential witnesses/confidential 
sources for interview. Additionally, they contain background information about third-party 
individuals, the origins of pertinent information connecting them to the investigation, and their 
connections to subjects and their relationship with the pending investigation. The release of this 
information would reveal the nature and scope of the ongoing investigation by revealing: the 
investigative steps taken to obtain witness and source interviews; techniques and investigative 
methods used to compile and/or solicit information from various sources; and any potential or 
perceived challenges in the investigations. 
(72) 
Miscellaneous Administrative Documents: These materials include items such as 
transmittal forms and standardized forms used for a variety of purposes. These types of 
materials have been used throughout this investigation for many routine purposes; however, the 
manner in which they have been used and organized in the files also reveals information of 
investigative value. The disclosure of this information could undermine this pending and 
ongoing investigation as well as pending and prospective prosecutions.

Category 3: Public Source/Non-Investigative Harm Materials 
(73) 
The FBI released 46 pages to Plaintiffs of public source material not posing an 
investigative harm from within the investigative files. Prior to the shift in processing to the 
categorical review, the FBI released an additional 135 pages in full to Plaintiffs. The FBI 
determined that this information could be released without harm to the ongoing investigations, as 
the information is already known to the public and is not reasonably expected to interfere with 
pending criminal law enforcement proceedings or prosecutions. Thus, the disclosure of this 
information would not result in any of the various harms under Exemption 7(A) as described 
herein. 
(74) 
During the course of an FBI investigation, including this one, relevant and 
pertinent articles in newspapers, magazines or other periodicals are placed by FBI employees 
into the investigative file. These materials contain information obtained from public sources 
such as newspapers, on-line material, court transcripts, criminal affidavits, and other court 
filings. FBI employees place these public source materials into the file for background and 
review purposes. In this case, the public source material released to Plaintiffs consisted of news 
articles and various public court documents from Epstein's criminal case. Because the FBI had 
determined that the release of these specific public source documents would not harm or 
otherwise jeopardize the ongoing criminal investigation, the FBI did not withhold these 
documents from the Plaintiffs. 
EXEMPTIONS 6 AND 7(C) 
CLEARLY UNWARRANTED INVASION OF PERSONAL PRIVACY

privacy." 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(6). All information that applies to a particular person falls within 
the scope of Exemption 6. 
(76) 
Exemption 7(C) similarly exempts from disclosure "records or information 
compiled for law enforcement purposes [when disclosure] could reasonably be expected to 
constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy." 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(C),I7
(77) 
When withholding information pursuant to these two exemptions, the FBI is 
required to balance the privacy interests of the individuals mentioned in these records against any 
public interest in disclosure. In asserting these exemptions, each piece of information was 
scrutinized to determine the nature and strength of the privacy interest of every individual whose 
name and/or identifying information appears in the documents at issue. When withholding the 
information, the individual's privacy interest was balanced against the public's interest in 
disclosure. For purposes of these exemptions, a public interest exists only when information 
about an individual, their name, or other factors that could potentially identify the individual's 
would shed light on the FBI's performance of its mission to protect and defend the United States 
against terrorist and foreign intelligence threats, to uphold and enforce the criminal laws of the 
United States, and to provide leadership and criminal justice services to federal, state, municipal, 
The practice of the FBI is to assert Exemption 6 in conjunction with Exemption 7(C). 
Although the balancing test for Exemption 6 uses a "would constitute a clearly unwarranted 
invasion of personal privacy" standard and the test for Exemption 7(C) uses the lower standard 
of "could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy," the 
analysis and balancing required by both exemptions is sufficiently similar to warrant a 
consolidated discussion. The privacy interests are balanced against the public's interest in 
disclosure under both exemptions. 
IS As used herein, identifying information includes the following: dates of birth, places of birth, 
residences, telephone numbers, social security numbers, singular professional titles, statements, 
unique locations, and/or other information that is identifiable to an individual.

and international agencies and partners. In each instance wherein information was withheld 
pursuant to Exemptions 6 and 7(C), the FBI determined that the individuals' privacy interests 
outweighed any public interest in disclosure. 
(78) 
Furthermore, since privacy concerns are typically obviated once an individual is 
deceased,19 the FBI takes several steps, during FOIA processing, to ascertain the current 
life/death status of the individuals whose names are withheld. The FBI uses the birth date and/or 
the date of the investigation to determine whether an individual is living or deceased, to the 
extent either or both of these pieces of information are discernable from the file. The date of 
birth is used to apply the judicially-recognized "100-year rule," i.e., if the individual was born 
more than 100 years ago, the FBI presumes that he or she is dead and the name and/or 
identifying information is released. The FBI also uses institutional knowledge gained from prior 
FOIA requests or internal records. By using institutional knowledge, the FBI can identify with 
sufficient certainty the life/death status of certain individuals. If the FBI is unable to determine 
the life/death status of an individual through the use of these methods, the name and identifying 
information of the individual is withheld pursuant to Exemptions 6 and 7(C), when it finds 
disclosure would constitute an unwarranted invasion of those individuals' privacy should they 
still be living and no public interest would be served in releasing the names. It is also the FBI's 
policy to release all names of high-ranking FBI officials in policy-making positions, as well as 
individuals in public positions, as they do not have privacy rights while acting in their official 
capacity. This policy is applied to the individual's position at the time of the creation of the 
document, and not the present. 
In some circumstances, surviving relatives of a deceased individual retain privacy interests in 
their information, even after the individual's death. See generally National Archives v. Favish, 
124 S. Ct. 1570 (2004).

(b)(6)-1 and (b)(7)(C)-1: Names and Identifying Information of 
Third Parties of Investigative Interest 
(79) 
Within Exemption category (b)(6)-1 and (b)(7)(C)-1, the FBI protected the names 
and identifying information of third parties who were of investigative interest to the FBI. Being 
identified as a subject of FBI investigative interest carries a strong negative connotation and a 
stigma, whether or not these individuals ever committed criminal acts. Release of the identities 
of these individuals to the public could subject them to harassment or embarrassment, as well as 
undue public attention. Furthermore, it could result in professional and social repercussions, due 
to resulting negative stigmas. Accordingly, the FBI determined these individuals maintain 
substantial privacy interests in not having their identities disclosed. In contrast, disclosing 
personal information about these individuals would not significantly increase the public's 
understanding of the FBI's performance of its mission and so the FBI concluded that there was 
no public interest here sufficient to override these individuals' substantial privacy interests. For 
these reasons, the FBI properly withheld this information pursuant to Exemptions 6 and 7(C). 
(b)(6)-2 and (b)(7)(C)-2: Names and Identifying Information of 
FBI Special Agents and Victim Specialists 
(80) 
Within Exemption category (b)(6)-2 and (b)(7XC)-2, the FBI protected the names 
and identifying information of FBI Special Agents ("SAs") and Victim Specialists. These FBI 
personnel were responsible for conducting, supervising, and/or maintaining the 
investigation/investigative activities related to the child prostitution investigation of Jeffrey 
Epstein, reflected in the documents responsive to Plaintiffs' request. These responsibilities 
included, but are not limited to, the following: coordinating/completing tasks in support of the 
FBI's investigative and administrative functions, compiling information, and/or reporting on the 
status of the investigation.

(81) 
Assignments of SAs to any particular investigation are not by choice. Publicity, 
adverse or otherwise, arising from a particular investigation, may seriously prejudice their 
effectiveness in conducting other investigations or performing their day-to-day work. The 
privacy consideration is also applied to protect FBI SAs, as individuals, from unnecessary, 
unofficial questioning as to the conduct of this or other investigations/investigative activities, 
whether or not they are currently employed by the FBI. FBI SAs conduct official inquiries into 
various criminal and national security violation cases. The publicity associated with the release 
of an SA's identity in connection with a particular investigation could trigger hostility toward a 
particular SA. During the course of an investigation, an SA may engage with all strata of 
society, conducting searches and making arrests, both of which result in reasonable but 
nonetheless serious disturbances to people and their lives. Persons targeted by such 
investigations/investigative activities, and/or those sympathetic to those targeted, could seek to 
inflict violence on an SA based on their participation in an investigation. This is because an 
individual targeted by such law enforcement actions may carry a grudge against those involved 
with the investigation, which may last for years. These individuals may seek revenge on SAs 
and other federal employees involved in a particular investigation. There is no public interest 
served by disclosing the identities of the SAs because their identities would not, themselves, 
significantly increase the public's understanding of the FBI's operations and activities. 
(82) 
The role of a Victim Specialist is to aid with those who suffered through physical, 
emotional, or financial harm as a result of a crime. A standard service provided by a Victim 
Specialist, specifically within these documents is to accompany SAs to interviews and provide as 
a critical link between the SAs and the victims for the Victim Assistance Program ("VAP"). 
VAP helps the victims cope and recover from the harm they have endured while allowing the

SAs to continue forward with their investigations. Protection of the Victim Specialists' identities 
is not only imperative for their safety, but also the victims' safety and allows the victims to 
confide to the FBI personnel involved in the investigation. Thus, disclosure of this information 
would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of their personal privacy; and the FBI properly 
withheld the names and identifying information of FBI SAs and Victim Specialists pursuant to 
Exemptions 6 and 7(C). 
(b)(6)-3 and (b)(7)(C)-3: Names and Identifring Information Regarding 
Third Party Victims 
(83) 
In Exemption category (b)(6)-3 and (b)(7)(C)-3, the FBI protected the names and 
identifying information of third-party victims. Releasing these individuals' identities in the 
context of these investigative records would cause embarrassment, as well as unsolicited and 
unnecessary attention to be focused on these individuals. Such a release could force them to 
relive emotionally trying events, causing further invasion of their privacy, in excess of the harms 
they have already been forced to endure. Thus, these victims maintain strong privacy interests in 
the protection of such personal information. Furthermore, there is no legitimate public interest to 
be served by releasing the identities of these victims because their identities, themselves, would 
not shed light on the operations and activities of the FBI. The FBI determined disclosure of this 
information would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of these individuals' personal 
privacy, and consequently withheld this information pursuant to FOIA Exemptions 6 and 7(C). 
Accordingly, the FBI asserted this Exemption category, at times in conjunction with Exemptions

these local law enforcement employees. Release of the identities of these law enforcement 
employees could subject them as individuals to unnecessary and unwelcome harassment that

disclosure of this information would serve no public interest because it would not shed light on

pursuant to Exemptions 6 and 7(C). 
(b)(6)-5 and (b)(7)(C)-5: Names and Identifying Information of 
Third Parties Merely Mentioned 
(85) 
In Exemption category (b)(6)-5 and (bX7)(C)-5, the FBI protected the names and 
identifying information of third parties who were merely mentioned in the investigative records 
responsive to Plaintiffs' request. The FBI has information about these third parties in its files 
because these individuals were tangentially mentioned in conjunction with FBI investigative 
efforts. These individuals were not of investigative interest to the FBI. These third parties 
maintain substantial and legitimate privacy interests in not having this information disclosed and 
thus, being connected with an FBI law enforcement matters. Considering the FBI is an 
investigative and intelligence agency, disclosure of these third parties' names and/or identifying 
information in connection with an FBI record carries an extremely negative connotation. 
Disclosure of their identities would subject these individuals to possible harassment or criticism 
and focus derogatory inferences and suspicion on them. The FBI then considered whether there 
was any public interest that would override these privacy interests, and concluded that disclosing

Exemptions 6 and 7(C). 
(b)(6)-6 and (b)(7)(C)-6: Names and Identifying Information of 
Non-FBI Federal Government Personnel 
(86) 
In Exemption category (b)(6)-6 and (b)(7)(C)-6, the FBI protected the names and 
identifying information of personnel from non-FBI, federal government agencies who provided 
information to or otherwise assisted the FBI in its investigation ofJeffrey Epstein. The rationale 
for protecting the identities of other government employees is the same as the rationale for 
protecting the identities of FBI employees. See g¶ 81-83, supra. Publicity, adverse or otherwise, 
concerning the assistance of these other agency employees in an FBI investigation would 
seriously impair their effectiveness in assisting or participating in future FBI investigations. The 
privacy consideration also protects these individuals from unnecessary, unofficial questioning as 
to the FBI investigation. It is possible for a person targeted by law enforcement action to carry a 
grudge which may last for years, and to seek revenge on the personnel involved in the 
investigation at issue in these FBI records. The publicity associated with the release of their 
names and/or identifying information in connection with this investigation could trigger hostility 
towards them by such persons. Therefore, these employees maintain substantial privacy interests 
in not having their identities disclosed in this context. In contrast, there is no public interest to be

In Exemption category (b)(6)-7 and (b)(7)(C)-7 the FBI protected the names and 
identifying information of local government personnel employees. The rationale for protecting 
the identities of local law enforcement personnel discussed in ¶ 85, supra, applies equally to the 
names and identifying information of these local government employees. Release of the 
identities of these local government employees could subject them as individuals to unnecessary 
and unwelcome harassment that would invade their privacy and could cause them to be targeted

The FBI has found information provided by individuals based on their personal 
knowledge is one of the most productive investigative tools for law enforcement agencies. The 
largest obstacle to successfully obtaining such information critical to FBI investigations, through 
an interview or otherwise, is fear by the individuals providing the information their identities will 
be exposed. Such exposure, in conjunction with their cooperation with law enforcement, could 
lead to harassment, intimidation by investigative subjects, legal or economic detriment, possible 
physical harm, or even death. In order to surmount their fear of reprisal, and the resulting

tendency to withhold information, persons who provide such information to the FBI must be 
assured their names and personally-identifying information will be held in the strictest 
confidence. Thus, the FBI has determined these individuals maintain substantial privacy 
interests in not having their identities disclosed. In contrast, the FBI could identify no public 
interest in the disclosure of this information because disclosure of these third parties' names and 
identifying information would not shed light on or significantly increase the public's 
understanding of the operations and activities of the FBI. Furthermore, the continued access by 
the FBI to persons willing to honestly relate pertinent facts bearing upon a particular 
investigation far outweighs any benefit the public might derive from disclosure of the names of 
those who cooperated with the FBI. Accordingly, the FBI properly protected these individuals' 
privacy interests pursuant to Exemptions 6 and 7(C). The FBI is also relying on Exemption 
7(D) to protect this information in many instances. 
EXEMPTION 7(D) — CONFIDENTIAL SOURCE INFORMATION 
(90) 
Exemption 7(D) protects "records or information compiled for law enforcement 
purposes" when disclosure: 
could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a 
confidential source, including a State, local or foreign agency or

compiled by a criminal law enforcement agency conducting a lawful 
national security intelligence investigation, information furnished 
by a confidential source. 
U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(D).

Numerous confidential sources report to the FBI on a regular basis; they provide 
information under express assurances of confidentiality and are "informants" within the common 
meaning of the term. Others are interviewed and/or provide information under implied

assurances of confidentiality (La, under circumstances from which assurances of confidentiality 
may be inferred). In either situation, these sources are considered to be confidential because they 
furnish information only with the understanding that their identities and the information they 
provided will not be divulged outside the FBI. Information provided by these sources is singular 
in nature, such that it is often distinct and traceable to a specific individual and if released, could 
reveal their identities. The FBI has learned through experience that sources assisting, 
cooperating with, and providing information to the FBI must be free to do so without fear of 
reprisal. The FBI has also learned that sources must be free to furnish information to the FBI 
with complete candor and without the understandable tendency to hedge or withhold information 
because of fear that their cooperation with the FBI will later be made public. Sources providing 
information to the FBI should be secure in the knowledge that their assistance and their identities 
will be held in confidence. 
(92) 
The release of a source's identity would forever eliminate that source as a future 
means of obtaining information. In addition, when the identity of one source is revealed, that 
revelation has a chilling effect on the activities and cooperation of other sources. Such a result 
undermines one of the FBI's most important means of collecting information and could thereby 
severely hamper law enforcement efforts to detect and apprehend individuals engaged in the 
violation of federal criminal laws. 
(b)(7)(D)-I: Names, Identifring Information of and Information Provided by Individuals under 
Implied Assurances of Confidentiality 
(93) 
In Exemption category (b)(7)(D)-1, the FBI protected the names, identifying 
information of, and information provided by third parties under circumstances in which 
confidentiality can be inferred. These third parties provided information concerning the 
activities of subjects who were of investigative interest to the FBI. Considering 1) the singularity

of the information provided and the likelihood these individuals could be identified through 
release of this information by those familiar with the events described; 2) the proximity of these 
sources to the investigative subjects and events they described; 3) and the nature of the criminal 
acts they described, the FBI inferred these individuals provided this information to the FBI only 
because they believed their cooperation with the FBI, and the information they provided, would 
remain confidential. 
(94) 
The FBI protected the identifying information of, and information provided by, 
individuals who conveyed critical information regarding criminal acts. These individuals were 
in unique positions allowing them ready access to and/or knowledge about investigative targets 
and others involved in child prostitution or trafficking of a minor. Such access exposed them to 
potentially significant harms should their association and cooperation with the FBI be publicly 
disclosed. One reason they risked harm when cooperating is they were within the orbit of 
suspected criminals, and such criminals (in the FBI's experience) typically seek to deter 
informants' cooperation with law enforcement through reprisal. Such reprisal can take many 
forms, to include defamation of the source's character among their peers/family; economic 
reprisal (deprivation of employment/business opportunities); violent threats aimed at instilling 
fear and doubt; or even violence itself. Even amidst these potential harms, these third-party 
sources provided specific, detailed information that is singular in nature — i.e., only a few 
individuals would be privy to such information. Thus, the FBI determined disclosure of the 
identities of these sources and the information they provided could subject these third parties, as 
well as their families, to retaliation or backlash, should their information be disclosed. 
(95) 
Considering the circumstances described above, it is reasonable to infer these 
third parties cooperated with the FBI only because they expected their identities and the

information they provided would be held in confidence. Therefore, the FBI properly protected 
the sources' identities and the information they provided pursuant to Exemption 7(D). 
(b)(7)(D)-2: Names, Identifying Information of and Information Provided by Individuals 
under Expressed Assurances of Confidentiality 
(96) 
Within Exemption category (b)(7)(D)-2, the FBI protected the names, identifying 
information of, and information provided by third parties to the FBI under express grants of 
confidentiality. When processing the records at issue, the FBI found evidence these individuals, 
who provided specific and detailed information that is singular in nature, either requested their 
identities not be revealed; and/or FBI investigators would have, by standard practice, expressly 
promised these third parties their identities and the information they provided would remain 
confidential. 
(97) 
Providing express assurances of confidentiality is essential to the FBI's ability to 
obtain relevant and accurate information from Cooperating Witnesses ("CWs"). This 
designation of CW is a positive indication these individuals entered into official, confidential 
relationships with the FBI in which they would have, by standard FBI practice, been provided 
with express assurances of confidentiality. In sum, the FBI relied on certain individuals who 
supplied information to the FBI with express assurance their names, identifying information, and 
the information they provided would be held in confidence. Release of such information would 
endanger these confidential sources and cause great detriment to the FBI's ability to recruit and 
maintain reliable confidential sources; thus, the FBI protected this information pursuant to 
Exemption 7(D). 
(b)(7)(D)-3: Foreign Government Agency Information under Implied Confidentiality

In Exemption category (b)(7)(D)-3, the FBI protected information provided to the 
FBI from a foreign agency under circumstances in which confidentiality can be inferred. The

FBI, in connection with a wide variety of criminal and national security investigations, solicits 
and receives information regularly from state, local, and foreign agencies and authorities. 
Inherent in the cooperative effort is the mutual understanding that the identity of such a source 
and the information provided by it will be held in confidence by the FBI, and not released 
pursuant to FOIA requests. If disclosure of the information provided in confidence were to be 
made public pursuant to FOIA requests, cooperation between the FBI and the foreign agencies 
and authorities would be greatly diminished, causing great detriment to effective law 
enforcement. The release of official United States Government documents that reveal the 
existence of a confidential relationship with a foreign government reasonably could be expected 
to strain relations between the United States and the foreign government and lead to diplomatic, 
political or economic retaliations. A breach of this relationship can be expected to have at least a 
chilling effect on the free flow of vital information to the United States law enforcement 
agencies, which may substantially reduce their effectiveness. Accordingly, the FBI properly 
withheld this information under FOIA Exemption 7(D). 
(b)(7)(D)-4: Information Provided by Local Law Enforcement Agency 
(99) 
Within Exemption category (b)(7)(D)-4, the FBI protected the names, identifying 
information of, and information provided by local law enforcement personnel under an implied 
assurance of confidentiality. Certainly, the FBI does not infer that all state or local law 
enforcement authorities who cooperate in federal investigations do so with expectations of 
confidentiality. However, under some circumstances, such an expectation may be inferred. 
Here, law enforcement authorities provided specific detailed information of value to the FBI, that 
is singular in nature, concerning Jeffrey Epstein. The FBI inferred these personnel provided this 
information to the FBI with an expectation their involvement in the investigation, and/or the

information they provided, would remain confidential due to the following: the information 
provided pertains to unknown investigations pursued by these agencies; or the information would 
expose the agency's personnel to undue public scrutiny based on their involvement with these 
particular matters. 
(100) The FBI relies heavily on assistance from its state and local law enforcement 
partners in pursuing its law enforcement and intelligence gathering missions. The disclosure of 
this information could have disastrous consequences. If this information were released to the 
public under FOIA, these agencies would be less likely to freely share sensitive information with 
the FBI. It could also harm the FBI's ability to seek support and or assistance from these 
agencies during joint investigations. Additionally, the FBI's disclosure of such information 
could 1) jeopardize these agencies' investigative techniques and procedures as disclosure would 
allow criminals to predict and circumvent use of these techniques and procedures; 2) discredit 
these state and local law enforcement authorities with current and future confidential sources, 
and greatly hinder their ability to recruit their own valuable sources; and 3) would jeopardize 
unknown investigations pursued by these agencies. Accordingly, it is reasonable for the FBI to 
infer these state and local law enforcement authorities provided this information to the FBI under 
circumstances in which an assurance of confidentiality can be implied. Thus, this information is 
exempt from disclosure pursuant to FOIA Exemption 7(D). 
EXEMPTION 7(E) 
INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES AND PROCEDURES 
(101) 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(E) provides protection for: 
law enforcement records [which]...would disclose techniques and 
procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or 
would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or 
prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk 
circumvention of the law.

(102) Exemption (b)(7)(E) has been asserted to protect information from these records, 
the release of which would disclose techniques and/or procedures for law enforcement 
investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations 
or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law. 
(103) Within the responsive documents, the FBI applied Exemption (b)(7)(E) to non-
public investigative techniques and procedures utilized by the FBI to pursue its law enforcement 
mission, and also to non-public details about techniques and procedures that are otherwise 
known to the public. Specifically, the FBI asserted Exemption 7(E) to protect the following 
categories of information. 
(6)(7)(E)-1: Collection and Analysis of Information 
(104) In Exemption category (b)(7)(E)-1, the FBI protected the methods the FBI uses to 
collect and analyze information it obtains for investigative purposes. The release of this 
information would disclose the identity of methods used in the collection and analysis of 
information, including how and from where the FBI collects information and the methodologies 
employed to analyze it once collected. Such disclosures would enable subjects of FBI 
investigations to circumvent similar currently used techniques. The relative utility of these 
techniques could be diminished if the actual techniques were released in this matter. This in turn 
would facilitate the accumulation of information by investigative subjects regarding the 
circumstances under which the specific techniques were used or requested and the usefulness of 
the information obtained. Release of this type of information would enable criminals to educate 
themselves about the techniques employed for the collection and analysis of information and 
therefore allow these individuals to take countermeasures to circumvent the effectiveness of 
these techniques and to continue to violate the law and engage in intelligence, terrorist, and

criminal activities. Accordingly, the FBI has properly withheld this information pursuant to 
FOIA Exemption 7(E). 
(b)(7)(E)-3: Sensitive File Numbers 
(105) In Exemption category (b)(7)(E)-3, the FBI protected sensitive investigative file 
numbers. The FBI determined this Exemption is appropriate for protecting these file numbers as 
the release of file numbering convention identifies the investigative interest or priority given to 
such matters. The file numbers the FBI protected are not known to the general public. These file 
numbers contain three separate portions. The first portions of these file numbers consist of FBI 
file classification numbers which indicate the types of investigative/intelligence gathering 
programs to which these files pertain. Many of the FBI's classification numbers are public, 
which makes disclosure of this information even more telling. Release of known file 
classification numbers in the context of investigative records would immediately reveal the types 
of investigations being pursued, and thus the types of investigative techniques and procedures 
available to FBI investigators, and/or non-public facets of the FBI's investigative strategies. For 
example, revealing that the FBI has a money laundering investigative file on a subject who was 
only known to be investigated for crimes related to public corruption would reveal key non-
public information about the FBI's investigative strategies and gathered evidence. Additionally, 
releasing non-public FBI file classification numbers would reveal critical information about non-
public investigative techniques and procedures, and provide criminals and foreign adversaries the 
ability to discern the types of highly sensitive investigative strategies the FBI is pursuing 
whenever such file classification numbers are present within these and other sensitive FBI 
investigative records. 
(106) The protected investigative file numbers also contain two letter office of

origination codes, indicating which FBI field office or overseas FBI legal attaché originated the 
investigations at issue. Providing this information, in many instances, would provide critical 
information about where and how the FBI detected particular criminal behaviors or national 
security threats, and reveal key pieces about the FBI's non-public FBI investigations or 
intelligence/evidence gathering sources and methods. Revealing this information could also risk 
disclosing unknown FBI investigations or intelligence gathering initiatives, by revealing interests 
in varying areas of FBI investigative responsibility. Releasing this information could also 
possibly provide significant information about the FBI's failure to detect certain types of 
criminal behavior. For example, a criminal operating out of San Francisco, California with ties 
to a criminal organization under investigation in the FBI's Seattle Field Office could request the 
FBI's Seattle Field Office's investigative file. If the FBI were to reveal all of the originating 
office codes in the investigative files present in Seattle's file, and there was no indication the FBI 
ever pursued an investigation in San Francisco, the criminal could reasonably assume the FBI 
failed to locate any evidence of their wrongdoing, emboldening them to continue their activities, 
undeterred. 
(107) The third portion of these investigative files consists of the numbers given to the 
unique investigative initiatives these files were created to memorialize. Releasing these singular 
file numbers would provide criminals and foreign adversaries with a tracking mechanism by 
which they can place particular files/investigations within the context of larger FBI investigative 
efforts. Continued release of sensitive investigative file numbers would provide criminals with 
an idea of how FBI investigations may be interrelated and when, why, and how the FBI pursued 
different investigative strategies. This would provide criminals with a means of judging where 
the FBI allocates its limited investigative resources, how the FBI responds to different

investigative circumstances, what the FBI knows and when/how they obtained the knowledge, 
and if there are knowledge-gaps in the FBI's gathered intelligence. 
(108) In summary, repeatedly releasing sensitive FBI investigative file numbers would 
allow determined criminals and foreign adversaries to obtain an exceptional understanding of the 
body of investigative intelligence available to the FBI; and where, who, what and how it is 
investigating certain detected activities. Release of this information would enable these 
criminals and foreign adversaries to predict FBI investigations and structure their behavior to 
avoid detection and disruption by FBI investigators, enabling them to circumvent the law. 
Accordingly, the FBI properly asserted FOIA Exemption 7(E) to protect this type of information. 
(b)(7)(E)-4: Dates/Types of Investigations 
(109) In Exemption category (b)(7)(E)-4, the FBI protected information pertaining to 
the type of investigation referenced in the records at issue in this case. Specifically, some of the 
information withheld, when referenced in connection with an actual investigation and not in 
general discussion, pertains to the type of investigation, whether it is a "preliminary" or "full" 
investigation and the dates the FBI initiated the investigations. Disclosure of this information 
would inform criminals the types of activities that would trigger a full investigation as opposed 
to a preliminary investigation, and the particular dates the investigations cover. Additionally, 
this information would also give criminals valuable insight into how the FBI develops its 
investigations. Release of this information would allow investigative subjects to predict FBI 
investigative strategies and adjust their behavior accordingly. Moreover, revealing that a specific 
activity in general warrants investigation could likewise cause individuals to adjust their conduct 
to avoid investigative scrutiny by the FBI. Disclosure of information related to the type of 
investigation could enable criminals to time and structure their illegal activities accordingly to

circumvent the FBI's attempts to enforce federal laws; therefore, the FBI has properly withheld 
this information pursuant to Exemption 7(E). Accordingly, the FBI asserted this Exemption 
category, at times in conjunction with Exemptions 3, 6, and 7(C) to protect names and 
identifying information of third parties. 
(b)(7)(E)-5: Information Regarding Target, Dates, and Scope of Surveillance 
(110) In Exemption category (b)(7)(E)-5, the FBI protected information concerning the 
target, dates, and scope of the surveillance operation conducted by the FBI in relation to the 
investigation at issue here. The FBI utilized this surveillance operation to obtain investigative 
intelligence relevant to the investigation of Jeffrey Epstein. Certainly, it is publicly known that 
the FBI and other law enforcement agencies engage in different types of surveillance in 
investigations. However, disclosure of non-public details about who, when, how, and under 
what circumstances the FBI conducts surveillance would allow current and future subjects of 
FBI investigations and other potential criminals to develop and utilize countermeasures to defeat 
or avoid different types of surveillance operations, thus rendering the techniques useless to the 
FBI and other law enforcement agencies. This is especially true because the success of 
investigative surveillance hinges on investigators' abilities to remain undetected. Revealing any 
non-public details about the FBI's methodology for conducting surveillance could potentially 
jeopardize the FBI's ability to operate surveillance covertly, and risks circumvention of the law. 
Accordingly, the FBI properly asserted Exemption 7(E) to withhold this information. 
(b)(7)(E)-6: Information Contained in Effectiveness Rating FD-515 
(111) In Exemption category (b)(7)(E)-6, the FBI protected certain sensitive 
investigative information located within standardized FBI FD-515 forms. FD-515's are forms 
used by FBI personnel to report investigative accomplishments. FD-515s are submitted at

various stages of an investigation to report important events such as an arrest, conviction, 
sentencing, asset seizure, and disruption/dismantlement of a criminal enterprise. The FBI 
asserted Exemption 7(E) to protect from disclosure statistical information concerning 
effectiveness ratings assigned to various FBI investigative techniques. At the upper right-hand 
side of this form is a block captioned "Investigative Assistance and Techniques Used." This 
block lists numerous publicly known investigative techniques and assistances, some of which 
were used by the investigative personnel during the FBI's investigation of Jeffrey Epstein. 
Opposite each investigative technique and assistance is a rating column which records a 
numerical rating from 1 to 4 to rate each technique/assistance used by investigative personnel 
during the course of the investigation. The numerical rating evaluates the effectiveness of each 
technique/assistance used in bringing the investigation to a successful conclusion. The entire 
rating column has been deleted to protect from release the various techniques and assistance 
used, and their effectiveness in the investigation. If the rating columns were released along with 
the ratings of each technique and assistance used, others involved in similar criminal activities 
could change their methods and modus operandi in order to circumvent and avoid detection 
and/or disruption by FBI investigators, through the use of these techniques, in the future. The 
protection of these rating columns is essential to prevent future circumvention of the law by 
criminals. Therefore, the FBI properly protected this information pursuant to FOIA Exemption 
7(E). 
(112) Additionally, the FBI asserted Exemption 7(E) to withhold the "Assisting 
Agencies" portions of the FD-515s within the responsive records. This was done to neither 
confirm nor deny if any other federal, state, or local agencies assisted the FBI in law enforcement 
activities. This is standard RIDS processing policy for all FD-515 Accomplishment Reports and

associated documents. Affirmatively acknowledging which law enforcement agencies (whether 
state, local, or federal) assisted the FBI in its investigative efforts of the subjects of FD-515s 
risks confirming unknown investigative interests of other law enforcement agencies by revealing 
these other agencies' interests in the subject. Such revelations would allow subjects to predict 
law enforcement actions, modify their behavior in a manner which avoids the investigative 
efforts of law enforcement, and enable them to circumvent the law. Furthermore, if this portion 
of the FD-515 is blank, thus revealing no other agencies assisted the FBI, criminals would be 
able to discern if some of their criminal behaviors have gone undetected. This risks emboldening 
such criminals to continue undetected criminal activities. It would also allow them to judge law 
enforcement agencies' strengths and weaknesses in regards to detecting/disrupting particular 
criminal activities; structure their activities to exploit this knowledge; and successfully evade law 
enforcement agencies' efforts to enforce the law. Accordingly, only by employing the practice 
of always redacting this portion of FD-515s is the FBI able to avoid the substantial law 
enforcement circumvention risks enumerated above; thus, the FBI properly withheld this 
information pursuant to FOIA Exemption 7(E). 
(b)(7)(E)-7: Database Identifiers/Printouts 
(113) In Exemption category (b)(7)(E)-7, the FBI protected the identities of sensitive 
investigative databases and database search results located through queries of these non-public 
databases used for official law enforcement purposes by the FBI. Releasing the identities of 
these databases and any information located through queries of these databases would give 
criminals insight into the available tools and resources the FBI uses to conduct criminal and 
national security investigations (Le., the scope of information stored within the databases, how 
the FBI uses the databases to support its investigations, the types of information most valued by

the FBI for particular investigations, and vulnerabilities of the databases). 
(114) Revealing the use of these databases in the context of FBI investigative records, 
and the information generated through queries of these databases, would reveal the nature of 
their utility to FBI investigators and the scope of information stored within the databases. 
Disclosing when and why the FBI queries these databases would reveal key information about 
FBI investigative strategies. This is because different investigative databases contain varying 
datasets and revealing the types of data sought by investigators in particular investigative 
circumstances would reveal the FBI strategies employed in response to different investigative 
circumstances. Additionally, disclosing the search results for particular subjects would provide 
criminals with an understanding of the scope of FBI collected intelligence on particular subjects. 
It would expose possible intelligence gaps and/or intelligence gathering strengths. This would 
allow criminals to make informed decisions on how they might structure their behavior to exploit 
these strengths and weaknesses and avoid detection and/or disruption by the FBI. 
(115) Revealing the types of information stored in these databases would also reveal the 
types of information most useful to FBI investigators. This would provide criminals with an 
understanding of how they might structure their behavior and/or deploy countermeasures to 
deprive the FBI of useful intelligence/evidence, thus jeopardizing the FBI's investigative 
mission. 
(116) Finally, revealing the identities of these databases could jeopardize the FBI's 
investigative mission by revealing exactly where the FBI is storing and obtaining valuable 
investigative data. Knowing the database names makes the original source data an attractive 
target for compromise. It would allow criminals who gain access to FBI systems an idea of 
where they can go to discover what the FBI knows, how it gathered the information, and possible

information regarding the FBI's investigative strategies. It would also offer these criminals the 
opportunity to corrupt or destroy information stored within these databases. 
(117) In summary, release of this information relative to FBI investigation databases 
impedes the FBI's effectiveness and potentially aids in circumvention of valuable investigative 
techniques. Therefore, the FBI withheld this information pursuant to Exemption 7(E). 
(b)(7)(E)-9: Monetary Payments/Funding for Investigative Purposes 
(118) In Exemption category (b)(7)(E)-9, the FBI protected information about monetary 
amounts requested by FBI personnel and/or paid by the FBI in order to implement particular 
investigative techniques. The FBI has limited resources that it must allocate strategically in 
order to effectively pursue its law enforcement and intelligence gathering missions. Revealing 
the amount of money the FBI has paid or plans to pay in order to implement certain investigative 
techniques would reveal the FBI's level of focus on certain types of law enforcement or 
intelligence gathering efforts and priority given to certain investigative matters. Revealing this 
level of focus would reveal how the FBI plans to allocate its limited resources and essentially 
paint a picture as to where the FBI's strengths and weaknesses lie within the spectrum of illegal 
activities it is mandated to investigate. Releasing this information would give criminals the 
opportunity to structure their activities in a manner which avoids the FBI's strengths and exploits 
its weaknesses. Because release of this type of information would enable criminals to 
circumvent the law, this information has been properly withheld pursuant to Exemption 7(E).

("PACER"), and the records responsive to Plaintiffs' request are still sealed. Therefore, the FBI 
withheld responsive information subject to the sealing order, which precludes release of the 
following pages by the FBI: Bates pages 03956-1033 through 03956-1070. Due to the sealing 
order, these pages were not reviewed for applicable FOIA exemptions. Should the court lift the 
sealing order, the FBI respectfully requests an opportunity to assert applicable FOIA exemptions. 
SEGREGABILITY 
(120) As discussed in ¶ 4 supra, the FBI processed a total of 11,571 responsive pages 
within the category of Bates-stamped records: 181 were released in full ("RIF"), 1,051 were 
released in part ("RIP"), and 10,339 were withheld in full ("WIF"). Each of these categories is 
discussed below to further address segregability. 
a. Pages RIF. Following its segregability review, RIDS determined 181 
pages could be released in full without redaction as there was no 
foreseeable harm to an interest protected by a FOIA exemption. 
b. Pages RIP. Following its segregability review, RIDS determined 1,051 
pages could be released in part with redactions per the identified FOIA 
exemptions herein. These pages comprise a mixture of material that could 
be segregated for release and material that was withheld as release would 
trigger foreseeable harm to one or more interests protected by the cited 
FOIA exemptions on these pages. 
c. Pages WIF. Following its segregability review, RIDS determined 10,339 
pages required withholding in their entirety. RIDS determined all

these pages was so intertwined with exempt material, no information could 
be reasonably segregated for release. Any further segregation of this 
intertwined material would employ finite resources only to produce 
disjointed words, phrases, or sentences, that taken separately or together, 
would have minimal or no informational content. Additionally, the FBI 
withheld 38 pages because they were deemed to be currently sealed 
pursuant to a United States District Court order, as described at ¶ 113, 
supra. Also, the FBI withheld 123 pages because they were duplicates of 
pages accounted for elsewhere in the FBI's production. It is the FBI's 
standard practice not to process duplicate pages, as doing so expends finite 
processing resources with a net result of no additional information being 
released to requesters. 
CONCLUSION 
(121) The FBI performed adequate and reasonable searches for responsive records; 
processed all such records and released all reasonably segregable non-exempt information from 
documents responsive to Plaintiffs' FOIA request that are subject to FOIA. The FBI processed 
the records under the access provisions of the FOIA to achieve maximum disclosure. 
Information was properly withheld pursuant to FOIA Exemptions 3, 5, 6, 7(A), 7(C), 7(D), and 
7(E). The FBI carefully examined the documents and determined the information withheld from 
Plaintiffs in this case, if disclosed, would reveal statutorily protected information; would reveal 
privileged information; could reasonably be expected to interfere with pending or prospective 
enforcement proceedings; would cause a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, or 
could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; could

Thanks, 
The problem is the stuff that is coming today is stuff the team asked PAE to process in early September. I 
realize that this is a big project and that there's only so much that can be done, but it poses almost insurmountable timing 
hurdles for our team if it is taking 1-2 months for PAE to get us stuff we ask for out of Relativity. In most of our cases, this 
one included, that eats up a huge chunk of the time we have available to produce discovery. 
We'll follow up early next week to see if there is a more concrete update, but I think this may require a broader or higher 
level explanation to the Court. I am concerned about requiring our team to take the hit with Judge Nathan for missing 
this deadline.

Some of the data is being sent to use today by FedEX. However, there is a ton of stuff still being processed. That stuff is 
still being imaged. Then it gets marked. Then copied to us. I have spoken to 
He thinks it is not possible to 
meet the November 9 date. He thinks the next step might be done on Tuesday, and then a better estimate of completion 
might be possible.

To the extent anybody in this small group is willing to share, are any of you folks' teams / cases getting significant pressure 
from the chiefs on memos or other written product this week, whether for the brass or otherwise? I'm just curious 
whether it's just the Epstein case (where we're getting near-daily prodding about imminent deadlines for memos that are 
both extremely time-intensive and also couldn't possibly be acted upon for weeks, given the circumstances of the world) 
or if it's something broader in the unit. I just sent the chiefs a pretty crabby email about being bugged daily about lengthy, 
detailed work product and it made me wonder whether this is a trend or an isolated incident. 
More importantly, hope y'all and families are all staying healthy ...

Ghislaine Maxwell moves under the Fourth Amendment, Martindell v. Intl TeL & TeL 
Corp., 594 F.2d 291 (2d Cir. 1979), and the Fifth Amendment, to suppress all evidence the 
government obtained from a grand jury subpoena it issued to
arid to 
dismiss Counts Five and Six, which are the fruits of that unlawful subpoena. 
FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
Ms. Maxwell's Motion under the Due Process Clause to Suppress and Dismiss Counts 5 
and 6 sets forth the facts relevant to this motion. Ms. Maxwell incorporates those facts by 
reference here. 
In summary, the government obtain 
file, including thr
by way of a grand jury subpoena enforced through an ex pane 
proceeding 
Although the government claimed not to know what was in 
file and that 
had no role in instigating the investigation of 
Maxwell, both of these representations tol
lwere false. 
In turn, the government issue 
in the 
See Motion under the Due Process Clause to Suppress and 
Dismiss Counts 5 and 6, Ex. C, at 3. The government could have been, but was not, more 
targeted in its approach. The government has not provided Maxwell with a copy of the subpoena, 
but the record shows that the subpoena was incredibly broad and, as explained below, ultimately 
unlawful. 
The subpoena violated the Fourth Amendment because it was overbroad and because it 
effected a warrantless search and seizure of material in which Maxwell had a reasonable 
expectation of privacy. Moreover, by securing a modification of the Protective Order through a 
secret, ex pane proceeding, the government violated Martindell v. hit? Tel. & Tel. Cap., 594 
I 
EFTA00015307
--- PAGE 6 ---
F.2d 291 (2d Cir. 1979), which required the government to give Maxwell notice and an 
opportunity to be heard on its request. And in bypassing Martindell and eviscerating the 
guarantee of confidentiality provided by the Protective Order, the government trampled on 
Maxwell's Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, which she declined to invoke 
in reliance on the protections afforded her by Martindell and the Protective Order. 
This Court should (I) suppress all evidence the government obtained fro 
and any other evidence derived therefrom; or (2) suppress the April and July 2016 depositions 
and all evidence derived therefrom; and (3) dismiss Counts Five and Six. 
ARGUMENT 
I. The government's violation of the Fourth Amendment requires suppression. 
The Fourth Amendment provides: "The right of the people to be secure in their persons, 
houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and 
no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and 
particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized." U.S. 
CONST. amend. IV. The "Fourth Amendment provides protection against a grand jury subpoena 
duces tecum too sweeping in its terms `to be regarded as reasonable.' United States v. Dionisio, 
410 U.S. 1, 11-12 (1973) (quoting Hale v. Henkel, 201 U.S. 43, 76 (1906), abrogated in part on 
other grounds by Murphy v. Waterfront Comm'n of New York Harbor, 378 U.S. 52, 68 (1964)). 
The government engages in a "search" for Fourth Amendment purposes when its conduct 
encroaches on an individual's legitimate expectation of privacy. See Katz v. United States, 389 
U.S. 347, 351 (1967) ("[T]he Fourth Amendment protects people, not places."). Absent an 
exception to the warrant requirement, a governmental search is unconstitutional unless the 
government conducts it under a warrant issued based on probable cause to believe a crime has 
been committed and that evidence of the crime is likely to be found in the place searched. 
EFTA00015308
--- PAGE 7 ---
Carpenter v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 2206, 2213 (2018) (holding that an "official intrusion into 
[the] private sphere generally qualifies as a search and requires a warrant supported by probable 
cause"). "[A] compulsory production of ... private books and papers ... is the equivalent of a 
search and seizure—and an unreasonable search and seizure—within the meaning of the fourth 
amendment." Boyd v United States, 116 U.S. 616, 634-35 (1886), overriding in part on other 
grounds as recognized in Fisher v. United States, 425 U.S. 391, 407-08 (1976). 
Finally, "The Fourth Amendment protects `effects' as well as people from unreasonable 
searches and seizures." United States v. Place, 462 U.S. 696, 716 (1983) (Brennan, J. 
concurring). It thus "protects two different interests of the citizen—the interest in retaining 
possession of property and the interest in maintaining personal privacy." Id. (cleaned up). "A 
seizure threatens the former, a search the latter." Id. Like a search, a seizure is "per se 
unreasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment unless it is accomplished pursuant to 
a judicial warrant issued upon probable cause and particularly describing the items to be seized." 
Id. at 701; see Colorado v. Bannister, 449 U.S. 1, 3 (1980). 
Here, the grand jury subpoena was unconstitutionally overbroad because it sought 
production of
entire file and was therefore akin to a general warrant. Moreover, 
there is no dispute the government did not establish probable cause to believe that= 
file contained evidence of a crime. 
Nor is there a dispute that the government lacked a warrant. 
Since the government had neither 
probable cause nor a warrant, the 
must be suppressed because the subpoena to-
EFTA00015309
--- PAGE 8 ---
was in fact a Fourth Amendment search. And even if the government's conduct did not 
amount to a search, it constituted a seizure, which likewise should have been supported by 
probable cause and warrant. 
A. The subpoena violated the Fourth Amendment because it was 
unconstitutionally overbroad. 
The subpoena to 
was unconstitutionally overbroad, and this Court should 
suppress all evidence produced in response. 
"[A]n order for the production of books and papers may constitute an unreasonable 
search and seizure within the 4th Amendment." Hale, 201 U.S. at 76. Because the Fourth 
Amendment was drafted with a particular eye to the abuse of general warrants, id. at 71, a 
subpoena that is "unreasonably overbroad" effects an unreasonable search under the Fourth 
Amendment, In re Grand Jury Subpoena, JK- I 5-029, 828 F.3d 1083, 1088 (9th Cir. 2016). An 
overbroad subpoena is "equally indefensible as a search warrant would be if couched in similar 
terms." Id. (quoting Hale, 201 U.S. at 77). A subpoena is overbroad when the government fails 
to make a "reasonable effort to request only those documents that are relevant and non-
privileged, consistent with the extent of its knowledge about the matter tinder investigation." Id. 
Here, the government by its own admission made no effort—must less a reasonable 
effort—to tailor and target the subpoena 
As the prosecutor said to-
EFTA00015310
--- PAGE 9 ---
See Motion under the Due Process Clause to Suppress and Dismiss Counts 5 and 6, Ex. D, at 17 
(emphasis added). The government's representations to 
were, of course, false. 
The government met witlabefore 
it issued the subpoena, it knew what was in 
-file 
and who was
, and it 
nevertheless disclaimed any ability to narrowly tailor any subpoena. Given "its knowledge about 
the matter under investigation," the government's failure to make any effort, much less a 
"reasonable effort," to request "only those documents that are relevant and non-privileged," 
renders the subpoena overbroad and unconstitutional. See In re Grand Jury Subpoena, JK-I 5-
029, 828 F.3d at 1088. 
So overbroad was the subpoena that 
actually produced to the government 
It is obvious why the Fourth Amendment requires suppression Id. at 1089. This type of 
overbroad subpoena is exactly what the Fourth Amendment is designed to prohibit: searches that 
invade "the privacies of life" from "arbitrary" power and "police surveillance" that is "too 
permeating." See Carpenter, 138 S. Ct. at 2213 (quoting Smith v. Maryland, 442 U.S. 735, 740 
(1979)). Otherwise, "when the government seeks all material of a broad generic type that a party 
possesses—every piece of paper in a corporation's files, for example, or, as in this case," every 
piece of paper in 
file, "a reasonable possibility that some of that material would be 
relevant would suffice to validate the subpoena, no matter how vast its sweep, and no matter the 
EFTA00015311
--- PAGE 10 ---
degree to which the subpoena would reach private material of no pertinence to the grand jury's 
inquiry." See In re Grand Jury Subpoena, JK-15-029, 828 F.3d at 1089. The Fourth Amendment 
does not allow such a sweeping search, which would be nothing but a modern-day general 
warrant. Id. at 1088.' This Court should suppress all evidence the government obtained from the 
subpoena toM=I 
B. The government's subpoena to
was an unconstitutional 
warrantless Fourth Amendment search. 
Apart from its overbreadth, the subpoena violated the Fourth Amendment because it 
amounted to a warrantless search without probable cause. 
The Fourth Amendment protects people, not places. Katz, 389 U.S. at 351. Thus, "when 
an individual 'seeks to preserve something as private,' and [her] expectation of privacy is `one 
that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable,' . . . that official intrusion into that private 
sphere generally qualifies as a search and requires a warrant supported by probable cause." 
Carpenter, 138 S. Ct. at 2213 (quoting Smith, 442 U.S. at 740). This definition of a what 
constitutes a "search" "seeks to secure `the privacies of life' against `arbitrary power' and "to 
place obstacles in the way of a too permeating police surveillance." Id. at 2214 (quoting Boyd, 
116 U.S. at 630; United States v. Di Re, 332 U.S. 581, 595 (1948)). A "grand jury is . . . 'without 
power to invade a legitimate privacy interest protected by the Fourth Amendment.' United 
States v. Thomas, 736 F.3d 54, 61 (1st Cir. 2013) (quoting United States v. Calandra, 414 U.S. 
338, 346 (1974)). 
' It is for this reason that this Court should grant Maxwell's Motion for Discovery of every grand 
jury subpoena. Without being able to examine the grand jury subpoenas, Maxwell cannot evaluate 
whether other subpoenas issued b the rand jury in connection with this case are unconstitutionally 
overbroad, as the subpoena to 
is. 
EFTA00015312
--- PAGE 11 ---
Maxwell had a legitimate expectation of privacy in he
 because 
she reasonably sought to preserve them as private. Both of he 
were 
confidential under the Protective Order, which prohibited
from sharing 
them with third parties, including law enforcement. The Protective Order deliberately excluded a 
law enforcement exception. While the Protective Order did not apply to evidence produced at 
trial, the parties settled the defamation action before trial, conclusively establishing the privacy 
of Maxwell's deposition testimony. Indeed, under the plain terms of the Protective Order, 
were required to return or destroy all confidential information at the 
conclusion of the case, including Maxwell's deposition transcripts 
refused to do 
so although ordered to do so by Judge Sweet.' 
In its application to 
the governmen 
Not only did the government misunderstand how the Protective Order worked, 
but its argument also supports rather than undermines Maxwell's legitimate expectation of 
privacy in her deposition transcripts. 
To be sure, the Protective Order did not apply to evidence produced at trial. That is 
entirely unremarkable, however, because trials are open to the public and the press. What matters 
is that the civil case did not go to trial; it settled before trial, and under the Protective Order's 
terms, 
Not to mention all the other material she designated as "Confidential" under the Protective 
Order. 
Ascribing a legitimate expectation of privacy to
also fits 
Martindell's admonition that the government may not "insinuate itself into a private civil lawsuit between 
others." 594 F.2d at 294. 
EFTA00015313
--- PAGE 12 ---
including Maxwell' 
and not to share Confidential information with law 
enforcement 
Motion under the Due Process Clause to Suppress and Dismiss Counts 5 and 6, Ex. F, at 11 
(emphases in original). 
Maxwell thus had a reasonable expectation of privacy in he 
and 
everything else she designated as "Confidential" under the Protective Order.' Obtaining that 
confidential material by subpoena therefore amounted to a search under the Fourth Amendment. 
Because the government had neither probable cause nor a warrant, this Court should suppress the 
MIMIand all material Maxwell designated as Confidential. 
1. The third-party doctrine does not compel a different result. 
It is irrelevant that Maxwell' s
MElwere in the possession of 
and not her own attorneys. The third-party doctrine does not apply here because 
This argument adheres to Martindell's holdin that the overnment there should have either 
moved to intervene or issued a subpoena to obtain th 
. For one thing, the Fourth 
Amendment was not at issue in Manindell, so the Court had no occasion to decide whether a warrant 
might have been required. For another, Martindell does not speak to what showing would have been 
required for the issuance of a subpoena, probable cause or something less. Even if a warrant weren't 
required here, a showing of probable cause was. See People v. Mason, 989 P.2d 757, 760 (Colo. 1999) 
(noting jurisdictions that recognize an expectation of privacy in subpoenaed materials and that require a 
subpoena duces tenon of such records to be supported by probable cause). Finally, of course, the 
government didn't comply with Manindell because it never gave Maxwell notice and an opportunity to 
quash the subpoena and to challenge the government's misrepresentations through the adversary process. 
EFTA00015314
--- PAGE 13 ---
Maxwell did not voluntarily share anything with=and because every other circumstance 
supported Maxwell's expectation that he 
would be private. 
The Supreme Court has held that "a person has no legitimate expectation of privacy in 
information [she] voluntarily turns over to third parties." Smith, 442 U.S. at 743-44. "That 
remains true `even if the information is revealed on the assumption that it will be used only for a 
limited purpose.'" Carpenter, 138 S. Ct. at 2216 (quoting United States v. Miller, 425 U.S. 435, 
443 (1976)). 
In Smith v. Maryland, the Court ruled that the government's use of a pen register—a 
device used by telephone companies to record the outgoing phone numbers dialed on a landline 
telephone—was not a search. By placing calls from his landline, the Court reasoned, Smith 
"voluntarily conveyed" the dialed numbers to the telephone company by "expos[ing] that 
information to its equipment in the ordinary course of business." 442 U.S. at 744. The Court held 
that Smith has "assumed the risk" that the telephone company's records "would be divulged to 
police." Id. at 745. 
Similarly, in United States v. Miller, the Court ruled that the government could subpoena 
an individual's bank records, including several months of canceled checks, deposit slips, and 
monthly statements. The Court explained that because the checks were "not confidential 
communications but negotiable instruments to be used in commercial transactions," and because 
the bank statements contained information "exposed to [bank] employees in the ordinary course 
of business," Miller had only a limited expectation of privacy. 425 U.S. at 442. The Court 
determined that Miller had "take[n] the risk, in revealing his affairs to another, that the 
information [would] be conveyed by that person to the Government." Id. at 443.

None of this was voluntary. 
Second, Maxwell's expectation of privacy in he 
is not limited in 
the way Miller's expectation of privacy was limited in his bank records. To the contrary, both 
Maxwell'- 
were confidential under the Protective Order. And while the Protective 
Order did not apply to evidence produced at trial, the case settled before trial, thereby confirming 
Maxwell's legitimate expectation that th

Third, Maxwell reasonably understood that the

proposed a law enforcement exception to the Protective 
Order's confidentiality requirement, but Maxwell rejected the exception and the district court 
never adopted it. Unlike in Smith and Miller, Maxwell did not "assume the risk" that her

Had the government obtained the 
from Maxwell's attorneys, there 
would be no question that the government's conduct would constitute a Fourth Amendment 
search. "[C]lients of an attorney maintain a legitimate expectation of privacy in their client files." 
DeMassa v. Nunez, 770 F.2d 1505, 1506 (9th Cir. 1985); see Doe v. Broderick, 225 F.3d 440, 
450-52 (4th Cir. 2000) (holding that detective's examination of a patient file held by a 
methadone clinic was a search and, without probable cause, violated the patient's Fourth

Amendment rights); see also People v. Gutierrez, 222 P.3d 925, 936 (Colo. 2009) (concluding 
that a taxpayer has a reasonable expectation of privacy in information conveyed to his tax 
preparer because "state and federal laws ... shield a taxpayer's return from unfettered access by 
government officials"). Because she did not voluntarily offe 
and 
because she reasonably believednas 
and would remain private under the 
Protective Order, Maxwell had a legitimate and reasonable expectation of privacy in her 
even though the government obtained them from a third party other than 
her attorneys. See In re Grand Jury Subpoena, JK-15-029, 828 F.3d at 1090 ("DAS's current 
possession of [Kitzhaber's] emails does not vitiate that claim. The Fourth Amendment protects 
people, not places. Kitzhaber's interests therefore attach to the things seized, not merely to the 
place where they are located." (cleaned up)). 
C. The government's subpoena to
was an unconstitutional 
Fourth Amendment seizure. 
Although Fourth Amendment challenges typically involve "the subsequent search of the 
container rather than to its initial seizure by the authorities, ... a seizure of personal property is 
per se unreasonable" under the "Fourth Amendment unless it is accomplished pursuant to a 
judicial warrant issued upon probable cause and particularly describing the items to be seized." 
Smith, 462 U.S. at 701-02. Here, the government 
The government did not obtain a warrant, nor did it 
establish probable cause for the seizure. For this additional reason, this Court should suppress the 
and all material Maxwell designated as confidential. 
II. The government's violation of Martindell requires suppression. 
By issuing 
the government circumvented the Second Circuit's 
II 
EFTA00015317
--- PAGE 16 ---
decision in Martindell v. International Telephone & Telegraph Corp. and violated Maxwell's 
rights. 
In Martindell, the government tried to obtain deposition transcripts of twelve individuals 
deposed in a private shareholders' derivative lawsuit. 594 F.2d at 292-93. All twelve depositions 
were taken "pursuant to a court-approved stipulation to the effect that the depositions should be 
treated as confidential and used solely by the parties for prosecution or defense of the action." Id. 
at 292. Without seeking to intervene, and without serving a subpoena or warrant, the government 
called and then wrote to the district court to request access to the deposition transcripts. Id. at 
293. The government claimed that the deposition transcripts were relevant to its investigation of 
perjury, subordination of perjury, and conspiracy related to the 1970 presidential election in 
Chile. Id. The government, "moreover, feared that unless it could obtain the deposition 
transcripts, it would be unable to secure statements from the witnesses because they would claim 
their Fifth Amendment rights in any investigative interviews." Id. The district court denied the 
government's request, "holding that the deposition testimony had been given in reliance upon the 
protective order, thus rendering unnecessary invocation by the witnesses of their Fifth 
Amendment rights, that the requested turnover would raise constitutional issues, and that 
principles of fairness mandated enforcement of the protective order." Id. The government 
appealed, and the Second Circuit affirmed. 
The Second Circuit was blunt in explaining the government's missteps: 
The government may not ... simply by picking up the telephone or writing a letter 
to the court (as was the case here), insinuate itself into a private civil lawsuit 
between others. The proper procedure, as the government should know, was either 
to subpoena the deposition transcripts for use in a pending proceeding such as a 
grand jury investigation or trial, in which the issue could be raised by motion to 
quash or modify the subpoena, see Rule 17(c), or to seek permissive intervention 
in the private action pursuant to Rule 24(b), for the purpose of obtaining vacation 
or modification of the protective order. 
EFTA00015318
--- PAGE 17 ---
Id. at 294. Either avenue, explained the Court, would provide the real party in interest notice of 
the government's request and an opportunity to be heard, either by moving to quash the 
subpoena or opposing intervention and modification of the protective order. Id. 
The Court also rejected the government's argument that the district court was too 
solicitous of the witnesses' Fifth Amendment rights. Id. at 295. According to the Government, 
the witnesses were under no compulsion to testify, and having given testimony, they voluntarily 
waived any Fifth Amendment right they may have had. Id. But as the Second Circuit explained, 
the government's argument ignored the reality of civil litigation: 
Unless a valid Rule 26(c) protective order is to be fully and fairly enforceable, 
witnesses relying upon such orders will be inhibited from giving essential 
testimony in civil litigation, thus undermining a procedural system that has been 
successfully developed over the years for disposition of civil differences. In short, 
witnesses might be expected frequently to refuse to testify pursuant to protective 
orders if their testimony were to be made available to the government for criminal 
investigatory purposes in disregard of those orders. 
Id. at 295-96. The Court thus held: 
[A]bsent a showing of improvidence in the grant of a Rule 26(c) protective order 
or some extraordinary circumstance or compelling need, none of which appear here, 
a witness should be entitled to rely upon the enforceability of a protective order 
against any third parties, including the Government, and that such an order should 
not be vacated or modified merely to accommodate the government's desire to 
inspect protected testimony for possible use in a criminal investigation, either as 
evidence or as the subject of a possible perjury charge. 
Id. at 296. 
Maxwell did not even know the government had he 
until after she was 
EFTA00015319
--- PAGE 18 ---
indicted, and she didn't know for a month more ju 
Martindeli has been binding Second Circuit law for more than forty years, and the 
government's violation of its holding is no trivial matte 
In Palmieri v. State of New York, the federal magistrate issued two sealing orders 
protecting the confidentiality of settlement discussions of a private antitrust case. 779 F.2d 861, 
863-64 (2d Cir. 1985). Because the subject matter of the antitrust case overlapped with an 
ongoing state criminal antitrust case, the state Attorney General moved to intervene in the private 
antitrust case, to modify the seal orders, to access the settlement material, and to present the 
material and testimony to a state grand jury. Id. at 862. The district court granted the Attorney 
General's request, but the Second Circuit, applying Martindell, reversed. Id. The Second Circuit 
recognized that the state Attorney General, like the federal government, "enjoys a similarly 
privileged position with respect to its investigatory powers." Id. at 866. Those powers, in turn, 
"raise[d] a rebuttable presumption against modification of the orders." Id. Indeed, given the 
parties' reliance on the sealing orders, the Attorney General's "burden [was] heavier than it 
might otherwise be." Id. at 865. 
EFTA00015320
--- PAGE 19 ---
Here, the government did not even attempt the Martindell process the Attorney General 
attempted in Palmieri 
III. The government's violation of the Fifth Amendment requires suppression. 
The Fifth Amendment provides: "No person ... shall be compelled in any criminal case 
to be a witness against himself." U.S. CoNsT. amend. V. For three separate reasons,■ 
violates the Fifth Amendment. 
First, the Fifth Amendment "proscribe[s] the compelled production of ... a Testimonial 
Communication that is incriminating." Fisher, 425 U.S. at 408; see Dionisio, 410 U.S. at 11 
("The grand jury cannot require a witness to testify against himself."). The subpoena to= 
contravenes this proscription because it literally "compels production" of Maxwell's 
incriminating testimony 
Second, "a compulsory production of the private books and papers . . . [also) is 
compelling ... him to be a witness against himself, within the meaning of the fifth amendment." 
Boyd, 116 U.S. at 634-35. Even if the subpoena does not literally require Maxwell to "testify 
against herself," Dionisio, 410 U.S. at 11, Maxwell's 
were private and 
confidential under the Protective Order. Supra Part I.B. Compelling production of these 
"private" papers is itself a Fifth Amendment violation. 
Third, the government's circumvention of Martindell unconstitutionally burdens 
Maxwell's Fifth Amendment rights. 
ut Martindell protects Maxwell from 
the government's conduct, and it authorized her to give
under the shield of 
the Protective Order without worrying whether the government could "insinuate itself" into the 
EFTA00015321
--- PAGE 20 ---
case and use her own words against her. 594 F.2d at 294. The Fifth Amendment would mean 
nothing if an individual were told by a district court that she need not invoke its protections 
because the government could not use her testimony against her—or at least could not do so 
without notice and an opportunity to be heard—only to find out that the testimony she offered 
with the district court's blessing was the primary evidence against her in a criminal case and the 
basis of perjury charges. 
That is the lesson of United States v. Oshatz, in which this Court quashed a government 
subpoena issued to a court reporter for a transcript of a deposition offered by the defendant in a 
civil proceeding. 700 F. Supp. 696, 697 (S.D.N.Y. 1988). Oshatz (who had been indicted at the 
time of his deposition) was deposed and did not invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege against 
self-incrimination on "the understanding that a protective order would preserve his Fifth 
Amendment rights." Id. at 699. Applying Martindell, this Court quashed the government's 
subpoena and refused to release the deposition transcript because the "government [had] not 
argued that the protective order was improvidently granted or that there [were] some 
extraordinary circumstances or compelling need." Id. at 701. 
Here, as in Oshatz, Maxwell was deposed on "the understanding that a protective order 
would preserve" the confidentiality of her testimony. And even though Maxwell had not been 
indicted at the time of her depositions, the threat of an investigation was obvious, and that threat 
was the very reason the Protective Order deliberately excluded a law-enforcement exception. 
(Moreover, Maxwell moved the court to requireMto disclose any law enforcement 
investigation of which she was aware.) As in Oshatz, the Protective Order was designed to 
preserve Maxwell's Fifth Amendment rights. Where this Court in Oshatz granted a motion to 
quash, here it should grant a motion to suppress.

Amendment.

opens 
There are prosecutors who would be afraid to charge a case that would require them to prove sex crimes that took 
place in 1994. If you want to find them, you'll have to go to Florida. This is the Southern District of New York. 
It is never too late for justice. Sometimes, you just have to have faith in the power of the truth and hope twelve jurors 
will do the right thing. At this trial, brave women will take the witness stand and the truth will come out: Ghislaine 
Maxwell sexually exploited underage girls. She caused unspeakable harm to vulnerable kids. It is time to hold her 
accountable. 
will open in the morning. Please come support. Details below. Updates to follow. 
Main courtroom: 40 Foley, courtroom 318 
Overflow courtrooms: 110, 506, 905, and 906. There is also a conference room on the first floor (room 130) that has a 
very small monitor with a live feed just for our office. 
Timing: we'll start at 8:30 a.m. with peremptory challenges, and we expect to go straight to preliminary instructions 
and opening statements. In order to get a seat, we'd recommend that you go over early.

Dear Ms. 
and Mr. Pecorino: 
I represent 
a victim of the sex trafficking crimes alleged to have been perpetrated by Jeffrey 
Epstein and his alleged lieutenant Ghislaine Maxwell. Ms. 
was one of the Epstein victims who spoke to 
deliver a victim impact statement in front of Judge Berman on August 29, 2019, when Judge Berman dismissed 
the Epstein indictment due to Epstein's apparent suicide. 
As you know, the criminal trial of Ms. Maxwell is scheduled to commence on November 29, 2021 before Judge 
Nathan. Ms. 
would like to attend the trial. Could you please advise me as to what protocols will be 
followed for obtaining admission to the trial either in the courtroom or the overflow rooms. Ms. 
is 
travelling from 
so it is important that there be some reasonable likelihood that she will be able to 
attend the trial once here.

UNITED STATES ATTORNEY'S OFFICE

FFI E 
FBI 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN CHARGED IN MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURT 
WITH SEX TRAFFICKING OF MINORS 
Alleged Conduct Occurred in both New York and Florida over Multiple Years, 
Involving Dozens of Victims 
Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, 
, the Assistant Director in Charge of the New York Field Office of the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI"), and James P. O'Neill, Commissioner of the New York 
City Police Department ("NYPD"), announced that JEFFREY EPSTEIN was arrested Saturday 
and charged with sex trafficking of minors and conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors. 
The indictment unsealed today alleges that, between 2002 through 2005, EPSTEIN sexually 
exploited and abused dozens of underage girls by enticing them to engage in sex acts with him in 
exchange for money. Epstein allegedly worked with several employees and associates to ensure 
that he had a steady supply of minor victims to abuse, and paid several of those victims 
themselves to recruit other underage girls to engage in similar sex acts for money. He committed 
these offenses in locations including New York, New York, and Palm Beach, Florida. EPSTEIN 
is expected to be presented in Manhattan federal court this afternoon before U.S. Magistrate 
Judge Henry B. Pitman. The case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Richard M. Berman. 
U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said: "As alleged, Jeffrey Epstein abused underage 
girls for years, operating a scheme in which girls he victimized would recruit others for Epstein 
to exploit and abuse. Epstein exploited girls who were vulnerable to abuse, enticed them with 
cash payments, and escalated his conduct to include sex acts, often occurring at his residence on 
the Upper East Side of Manhattan. While the charged conduct is from a number of years ago, 
the victims — then children and now young women — are no less entitled to their day in court. 
My Office is proud to stand up for these victims by bringing this indictment." 
EFTA00015350
--- PAGE 2 ---
FBI Assistant Director 
. said: "We are asking anyone who may 
have been victimized by Jeffrey Epstein, or anyone who may have information about his alleged 
criminal behavior, to please call us. The number is 1-800-CALL-FBI. We want to hear from 
you, regardless of the age you are now, or whatever age you were then, no matter where the 
incident took place. The bravery it takes to call us might empower others to speak out about the 
crimes committed against them. It is important to remember there was never, nor will there ever 
be an excuse for this type of behavior. In the eyes of the FBI, the victims will always come 
first." 
NYPD Commissioner James P. O'Neill said: "Today's charges serve as a warning to 
individuals who continue to prey upon some of our society's most vulnerable population: we are 
coming for you. I thank and commend the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District and 
the FBI for their tireless efforts to ensure child predators are taken off our streets. The NYPD 
will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to eradicate the trafficking of children 
in our city and nation and work to bring justice to victims of these heinous crimes." 
If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, 
please contact the FBI at 1-800-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
According to the Indictment' unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
From at least 2002 through at least 2005, JEFFREY EPSTEIN enticed and recruited, and 
caused to be enticed and recruited, dozens of minor girls to visit his mansion in New York, New 
York (the "New York Residence"), and his estate in Palm Beach, Florida (the "Palm Beach 
Residence"), to engage in sex acts with him, after which he would give the victims hundreds of 
dollars in cash. In order to maintain and increase his supply of victims, EPSTEIN also paid 
certain victims to recruit additional underage girls whom he could similarly abuse. In this way, 
EPSTEIN created a vast network of underage victims for him to sexually exploit, often on a 
daily basis, in locations including New York and Palm Beach. 
EPSTEIN's victims were as young as 14 at the time he abused them, and were, for 
various reasons, often particularly vulnerable to exploitation. Moreover, EPSTEIN knew that 
many of his victims were under 18, including because, in some instances, victims expressly told 
him they were underage. 
In creating and maintaining this network of minor victims in multiple states to abuse and 
exploit sexually, EPSTEIN worked with others, including employees and associates who 
facilitated his conduct by, among other things, contacting victims and scheduling their sexual 
encounters with EPSTEIN at the New York Residence and at the Palm Beach Residence. 
In both New York and Florida, EPSTEIN perpetuated this abuse in similar ways. 
Victims were initially recruited to provide "massages" to EPSTEIN, which became increasingly 
sexual in nature and would typically include one or more sex acts. EPSTEIN paid his victims 
hundreds of dollars in cash for each encounter. 
As the introductory phrase signifies, the entirety of the text of the Indictment, and the description of the Indictment 
set forth herein, constitute only allegations, and every fact described therein should be treated as an allegation. 
EFTA00015351
--- PAGE 3 ---
In particular, during encounters at the New York Residence, victims would be taken to a 
room where they would perform a massage on EPSTEIN, during which EPSTEIN would 
frequently escalate the nature and scope of physical contact with his victims to include, among 
other things, sex acts such as groping and direct and indirect contact with the victims' genitals. 
In connection with the encounters, EPSTEIN, or one of his employees or associates, typically 
paid each victim hundreds of dollars in cash. Once minor victims were recruited, EPSTEIN or 
his employees or associates would contact victims to schedule appointments for "massages." As 
a result, many victims were abused by EPSTEIN on multiple subsequent occasions. 
To further enable him to abuse underage girls, EPSTEIN asked and enticed certain of his 
victims to recruit additional minor girls to perform "massages" and similarly engage in sex acts 
with EPSTEIN. When a victim would recruit another underage girl for EPSTEIN, he paid both 
the victim-recruiter and the new victim hundreds of dollars in cash. Through these victim-
recruiters, EPSTEIN maintained a steady supply of new victims to exploit, and gained access to 
dozens of additional underage girls to abuse. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 66, is charged with one count of sex trafficking of minors, which 
carries a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison, and one count of conspiracy to engage in sex 
trafficking of minors, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
The statutory maximum and mandatory penalties are prescribed by Congress and are 
provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be 
determined by the judge. 
Mr. Berman praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and the NYPD. He 
also thanked the U.S. Customs and Border Protection for their assistance. 
This case is bein handled b the Office's Public 
rruption Unit. Assistant U.S. 
Attorneys 
are in char 
ecution, 
with assistance from the Office's Human Trafficking Co-Coordinator, 
e of the ros
The charges contained in the Indictment are merely accusations. The defendant is 
presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

I just got off the phone with 
from the FBI 
press office, inquiring about the logistics of that. I think they can get chairs for press, check with GSA on their Covid 
protocols (capacity, etc.), provide a "step-and-repeat" (a portable background with "FBI" and their seal) to reduce glare 
from the windows on the Duane Street side. The concerns are the acoustics (as you know, that space is cavernous, with 
all hard surfaces and a high ceiling) and their lack of a podium (so we'd have to lug ours over there). Is our lobby 
preferable? I can call 
back and call off the dogs.

The International Court of Trade has said no, so it looks like we're likely at Plan B (Plan Z?) option of using our whole lobby 
space in an effort to create some social distance. 
With apologies for adding to your full plate, Audrey asked if you could please come up with a paragraph to put at the top 
of tomorrow's press advisory, notifying the press of safety protocols—masks, social distancing, etc.—and asking them to 
please leave extra time to get into the building (which may mean we should also send out the advisory earlier than

It's tough to be more precise until we pin down a venue, but what do you think about a little more specificity regarding 
protocols as a placeholder, e.g.: MANDATORY COVID-19 SAFETY PROTOCOLS WILL BE 
IN PLACE,  INCLUDING MASKS AND SOCIAL DISTANCING. We can add some more 
language once we know if it'll be here or 
to reflect any other relevant particulars. 
As an update on arrest timing, the latest thinking is that tomorrow remains possible but that we may well be pushing to 
Thursday. We'll of course keep you posted.

Thanks very much,. Looping in 
and MI Please do keep exploring the IM 
option. If it's doable it might 
beat out our lobby—definitely seems like a stronger visual. On that note, if it was possible for one of you to take Audrey 
on a walk-through of 
as we figure it out, she'd appreciate it.

Wait, I thought we were now targeting the lobby of 
I just got off the phone with 
from the FBI 
press office, inquiring about the logistics of that. I think they can get chairs for press, check with GSA on their Covid 
protocols (capacity, etc.), provide a "step-and-repeat" (a portable background with "FBI" and their seal) to reduce glare 
from the windows on the Duane Street side. The concerns are the acoustics (as you know, that space is cavernous, with 
all hard surfaces and a high ceiling) and their lack of a podium (so we'd have to lug ours over there). Is our lobby 
preferable? I can call 
back and call off the dogs.

The International Court of Trade has said no, so it looks like we're likely at Plan B (Plan Z?) option of using our whole lobby 
space in an effort to create some social distance. 
With apologies for adding to your full plate, Audrey asked if you could please come up with a paragraph to put at the top 
of tomorrow's press advisory, notifying the press of safety protocols—masks, social distancing, etc.—and asking them to 
please leave extra time to get into the building (which may mean we should also send out the advisory earlier than 
usual). I've attached our safety protocols and am cc'ing

coordinate with them on how press screening will work. Happy of course to talk or help in any way.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
THE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY, 
Plaintiff, 
v. 
FEDERAL BUREAU OF PRISONS, 
Defendant. 
20-CV-00833 (PAE) 
DECLARATION OF KARA CHRISTENSON 
I, Kara Christenson, declare as follows: 
I. I am employed by the United States Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons 
("BOP"), as a Government Information Specialist ("GIS") for Central Office, stationed at the 
Federal Medical Center in Rochester, Minnesota ("FMC Rochester"). I have been assigned to 
Central Office since August 2016. Prior to that time, I served as a Paralegal for the North Central 
Regional Office ("NCRO") from September 2008 to August 2016. From June of 1994 through 
September of 2008, I served in various legal support positions for the Legal Department at the 
Federal Medical Center (FMC) in Rochester, MN. I have been employed by the BOP since March 
1992. 
2. As a Government Information Specialist, my duties include serving as a Freedom of 
Information Act (FOIA) Specialist responsible for all facets of processing FOIA and Privacy Act 
(PA) requests, with primary responsibility for analysis of, responses to, and monitoring of requests 
for BOP records pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552. I also provide litigation support for the FOIA 
EFTA00015361

Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 24 Filed 08/05/20 Page 2 of 34 
requests assigned to me. In addition to these responsibilities, I am authorized to review for final 
BOP disposition the FOIA determination responses prepared by other GIS staff in my office. 
3. 
I submit this declaration in support of the BOP's motion for summary judgment, to 
describe BOP's search for records responsive to the FOIA requests submitted by Plaintiff, review 
of responsive records, and application of exemptions to responsive records. 
4. 
The statements made in this declaration are based upon my personal knowledge 
and information available to me in my official capacity and about which I have become 
knowledgeable.

In an email dated August 13, 2019, the BOP received a FOIA request from Plaintiff. 
The FOIA request sought documents "about Jeffrey Epstein who died at the Metropolitan 
Correctional Center (MCC) on Aug. 10, 2019." See Attachment 1, Plaintiff's FOIA request dated 
August 13, 2019. Specifically, Plaintiff sought the following records: 
(1) 
The signed log in the Special Housing Unit at MCC that shows 
when prison staff did rounds on July 22 and 23, and Aug. 9 and 10; 
(2) 
All quarter entries (showing which cells he was housed in) for 
Jeffrey Epstein at MCC;

(5) 
The intake screening form for Jeffrey Epstein at MCC; 
(6) 
The security designation records for Jeffrey Epstein at MCC; 
(7) 
The inmate profile for Jeffrey Epstein at MCC;

(9)

(12) 
All records generated from the meeting at MCC during which it 
was decided that Jeffrey Epstein would be taken off suicide watch; 
(13) 
The Post-Watch report compiled in order to take Jeffrey Epstein 
off suicide watch; 
(14) 
The overtime sign-up sheets for the Special Housing Unit (9 
South) at MCC for Aug. 9 and 10, and on July 22 and 23; and 
(15) 
Documents showing which staff were augmented at MCC and 
what positions they worked in on Aug. 9 and 10, and on July 22 
and 23. 
See id. 
6. 
In a separate email, also dated August 13, 2019, the BOP received a second 
FOIA request from Plaintiff for documents "about Jeffrey Epstein who died at the 
Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) on Aug. 10, 2019." 
See Attachment 2, 
Plaintiff's FOIA request dated August 13, 2019, Email 2. Specifically, Plaintiff sought 
the following records: 
(1) 
All video camera footage at MCC pertinent to the Jeffrey Epstein 
suicide and the first suicide attempt; 
(2) 
All BOP documents pertaining to Jeffrey Epstein's suicide and first 
suicide attempt; 
(3) 
All BOP documents, including email correspondence and meeting 
minutes, pertaining to the decision to remove Jeffrey Epstein from 
suicide watch; 
EFTA00015363
--- PAGE 4 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 24 Filed 08/05/20 Page 4 of 34 
(4) 
All BOP special investigation reports mentioning Jeffrey Epstein; 
and 
(5) 
All BOP correspondence with the U.S. Attorney's Office regarding 
Jeffrey Epstein. 
See id. 
7. 
Because these two email requests from the Plaintiff were dated the same date and 
received by the BOP on the same date, the BOP consolidated the requests as one request and 
assigned this consolidated request FOIA Request Number 2019-05665. On September 23, 2019, 
the BOP issued its final determination response regarding FOIA Request 2019-05665. See 
Attachment 3, Determination Response for FOIA Request 2019-05665. In its final determination 
response, the BOP categorically denied the request because "any records responsive to your 
request are categorically exempt from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, 5 
U.S.C. §§ 552 (b)(5); (b)(6); (b)(7)(A); (b)(7)(C); (b)(7)(E); and (b)(7)(F). Id. The BOP also 
advised Plaintiff, as to exemption (b)(7)(A), the application of the exemption was temporarily 
utilized "to protect active and on-going law enforcement proceedings." Id. 
8. 
Plaintiff appealed the BOP's determination response to the Office of Information 
Policy ("OIP"), and in response, OIP affirmed the BOP's determination response on partially 
modified grounds. See Attachment 4, OIP Determination Response on Plaintiff's Appeal. 
Specifically, OIP determined the "BOP properly withheld this information in full because it is 
protected from disclosure under the FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(A) and it is reasonably 
foreseeable that disclosure of this information would harm the interests protected by this 
provision." Id. OIP did not adjudicate the applicability of the other exemptions asserted by the 
BOP. Id.

In an email dated December 12, 2019, the BOP received a third FOIA request from 
Plaintiff for documents "about Jeffrey Epstein who died at the Metropolitan Correctional Center 
(MCC) on Aug. 10, 2019." See Attachment 5, Plaintiff's FOIA request dated December 12, 2019. 
Specifically, Plaintiff sought the following records: 
(1) 
The full log of Mr. Epstein's phone calls to and from the MCC; 
(2) 
All email correspondence to and from Mr. Epstein while he was at the MCC 
(including any correspondence through the Corrlinks system or any other 
email system he had access to); 
(3) 
The full log of people who visited Epstein while he was at the MCC when 
they visited; 
(4) 
The full list of people that Mr. Epstein had requested to be on his 
approved visitor list; 
(5) 
The full list of people that Mr. Epstein had requested to be on his 
approved email correspondence list; and 
(6) 
The full list of people that Mr. Epstein had requested to be on his 
approved call list. 
See id. 
10. In an email dated January 2, 2020, the BOP received a fourth FOIA request from 
Plaintiff for documents "about Jeffrey Epstein who died at the Metropolitan Correctional Center 
(MCC) on Aug. 10, 2019." See Attachment 6, Plaintiff's FOIA request dated January 2, 2020. 
Specifically, Plaintiff sought the following records: 
See id. 
(1) 
The full recordings of the last three phone conversations that Mr. Epstein 
had. 
11. 
In a response to the Plaintiff dated January 9, 2020, the BOP advised Plaintiff that 
the January 2, 2020, request and the December 19, 2020, request were aggregated under FOIA 
EFTA00015365
--- PAGE 6 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 24 Filed 08/05/20 Page 6 of 34 
Request Number 2020-01336. See Attachment 7, January 9, 2020, Aggregation of Requests 
Response Letter. The BOP did not issue a final determination response concerning FOIA Request 
2020-01336 prior to the filing of this action. On January 30, 2020, Plaintiff filed its Complaint in 
this case. 
II. 
SEARCH FOR RECORDS 
12. 
The BOP initiated a search of its records systems to identify records and other 
information potentially responsive to Plaintiff's FOIA requests. This search process entailed my 
consulting with staff across BOP divisions, offices, and facilities regarding the various items 
requested in Plaintiff's FOIA requests, and determining which BOP divisions, offices or facilities 
likely maintained potentially responsive records; staff undertaking searches for records; and staff 
subsequently forwarding any potentially responsive records to me for review to determine whether 
the records were responsive to the request, whether any records were duplicates of any other 
records received in response to the search; whether any records were exempt in whole or in part 
pursuant to any FOIA exemption; and whether any non-exempt information could be reasonably 
segregated from otherwise exempt records pursuant to FOIA to provide maximum release of the 
records. 
A. 
BOP's Search for Records and Records Retrieved 
13. 
SHU LOGS — Based the experience and training of myself and other staff involved 
in searching for records, it was determined that the SHU at MCC New York is the most likely 
place to locate records responsive to the request for "[t]he signed log in the Special Housing 
Unit at MCC that shows when prison staff did rounds on July 22 and 23, and Aug. 9 and I." 
EFTA00015366
--- PAGE 7 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 24 Filed 08/05/20 Page 7 of 34 
However, the SHU log books in question were handed over to the Office of the Inspector 
General ("OIG") on or about August 22, 2019. Therefore, the BOP is no longer in possession 
of the log books that are the subject of the FOIA request, and no responsive records were 
located. Scanned copies of certain log book pages, count slips, or other records showing when 
staff conducted rounds in the SHU were retained in the electronic files of certain individual 
staff members at MCC and were located through their searches for these documents. 
14. 
SENTRY QUARTER'S HISTORY - Based on the experience and training of 
myself and other staff involved in searching for records, it was determined that the SENTRY 
database was the most likely place where records responsive to the request for "[a]ll quarter entries 
(showing which cells he was housed in) for Jeffrey Epstein at MCC" would be located. The BOP 
SENTRY database is a real-time information system consisting of various applications for 
processing sensitive but unclassified (SBU) inmate information and for property management. 
Data collected and stored in the system include information relating to the care, classification, 
subsistence, protection, discipline, and programs of federal inmates. To search SENTRY for 
responsive information, staff used Jeffrey Epstein's unique inmate register number of 76318-054 
and the transaction code of PP37 for Quarters history. The search returned the Inmate History 
Quarters for inmate Epstein, which was produced to Plaintiff on June 22, 2019, with redactions. 
15. 
CIM CLEARANCE SHEET/SEPARATEE DATA - Based on the experience 
and training of myself and other staff involved in searching for records, it was determined that the 
SENTRY database was the most likely place where the "CIM Clearance and Separatee data sheet 
for Jeffrey Epstein at MCC" would be located. To search SENTRY for responsive information, 
staff used Jeffrey Epstein's unique inmate register number of 76318-054 and the transaction code 
EFTA00015367
--- PAGE 8 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 24 Filed 08/05/20 Page 8 of 34 
of PPIO for am and Separatee information. This SENTRY search returned the CIM Clearance 
and Separatee data sheet for inmate Epstein, which was produced to Plaintiff in full on June 22, 
2019. 
16. 
DISCIPLINARY RECORDS - Based on the experience and training of myself 
and other staff involved in searching for records, it was determined that the SENTRY database 
was the most likely place where the "chronological disciplinary records for Jeffrey Epstein at 
MCC" would be located. To search SENTRY for responsive information, staff used Jeffrey 
Epstein's unique inmate Register Number of 76318-054 and the transaction code of PD15 for 
disciplinary history. 
This SENTRY search returned the disciplinary history for inmate Epstein 
which was produced to Plaintiff in full on June 22, 2019, and one incident report for Epstein, which 
was withheld in full as noted in the attached index at Entry 1. 
17. 
INTAKE SCREENING FORM - Based on the experience and training of myself 
and other staff involved in searching for records, it was determined that the DROP File was where 
records responsive to the request for "the intake screening form for Jeffrey Epstein at MCC" would 
be located. A DROP File is a temporary, condensed version of a typical inmate Central File. 
(Program Statement 5800.17, Inmate Central Files, Privacy Folder and Parole Mini-Files) Only 
inmates in pre-trial status have their records maintained in a DROP File. Upon an inmate's 
sentencing, the DROP File records are incorporated into a regular Central File that follows the 
inmate for the remainder of incarceration. The DROP File contains records such as remand 
orders, some displinary information, personal property records and routine custody related records. 
Based on my experience, I requested staff at MCC New York conduct a search of inmate Epstein's 
DROP file for a copy of his Intake Screening Form as that is the location most reasonably expected 
EFTA00015368
--- PAGE 9 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 24 Filed 08/05/20 Page 9 of 34 
to locate the form. A review of inmate Epstein's DROP file did not produce records responsive to 
Plaintiff's request for the Intake Screening Form. Based on my own experience and conversations 
with MCC staff, there are no other locations reasonably expected to produce results. 
18. 
SECURITY DESIGNATION - Based on the experience and training of myself 
and other staff involved in searching for records, it was determined that the SENTRY database 
was the most likely place where "the security designation records for Jeffrey Epstein at MCC" 
would be located. To search SENTRY for responsive information, staff used Jeffrey Epstein's 
unique inmate register number of 76318-054 and the transaction codes of PPGO for Security 
Designation and PPG6 for Classification. The search returned the security designation for inmate 
Epstein, and produced to Plaintiff in full on June 22, 2019. 
19. 
INMATE PROFILE - Based on the experience and training of myself and other 
staff involved in searching for records, it was determined that the SENTRY database was the most 
likely place where "the inmate profile for Jeffrey Epstein at MCC" would be located. To search 
SENTRY for responsive information, staff used Jeffrey Epstein's unique inmate register number 
of 76318-054 and the transaction code of PP44 for Inmate Profile. The search returned the inmate 
profile security designation for inmate Epstein, and produced to Plaintiff in full on June 22, 2019. 
20. 
INCIDENT REPORTS - Based on the experience and training of myself and 
other staff involved in searching for records, it was determined that the SENTRY database was the 
most likely place where "[a]ll incident reports related to Jeffrey Epstein at MCC" would be located. 
To search SENTRY for responsive information, staff used Jeffrey Epstein's unique inmate register 
number of 76318-054 and the transaction code of PD15 for disciplinary history. This SENTRY 
search returned the disciplinary history for inmate Epstein which was produced to Plaintiff in full 
EFTA00015369
--- PAGE 10 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 24 Filed 08/05/20 Page 10 of 34 
on June 22, 2019, and one incident report for Epstein, which was withheld in full as noted in the 
attached index at Entry I. 
21. 
MEDICAL REPORTS - Based on the experience and training of myself and other 
staff involved in searching for records, it was determined that the Bureau Electronic Medical 
Record (BEMR) was the most likely place where "all medical reports related to Jeffrey Epstein at 
MCC." BEMR is the electronic medical records repository for the BOP that contains all medical 
records for inmates in BOP custody. To search BEMR for inmate related information, staff used 
Jeffrey Epstein's unique inmate register number of 76318-054 to retrieve all of his medical records. 
The search returned any medical, dental, optical and/or psychological records for inmate Epstein. 
The psychological records were withheld in full, as noted on the attached index at Entry 19. BOP 
is currently revewing the remaining BEMR records to segregate non-exempt information and 
intends to release the records in part. 
22. 
VISITOR LOG - Based on the experience and training of myself and other staff 
involved in searching for records, it was determined that the TRUVIEW database was the most 
likely place where visitor log information for inmate Epstein would be located. TRUVIEW is a 
BOP database that combines several inmate information databases (i.e., inmate finances, call lists, 
messaging, visiting, and volunteer management) into one program. Regarding inmate visitors, 
the TRUVIEW contains a log of all inmate visits. To search TRUVIEW for inmate related 
information, staff used Jeffrey Epstein's unique inmate register number of 76318-054 to retrieve 
all 
of 
his 
visitor 
information. 
The search 
returned 
the 
Federal 
Bureau 
of 
Prisons/TRUVIEW/Inmate Center Report for inmate Epstein, produced to Plaintiff with redactions 
on June 22, 2019. Scanned copies of certain log book pages showing visitors to Epstein were 
EFTA00015370
--- PAGE 11 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 24 Filed 08/05/20 Page 11 of 34 
retained in the electronic files of certain individual staff members at MCC and were located 
through their searches for these documents. The search returned two pages of scanned visitor 
logs, which BOP is reviewing for segregable non-exempt information and intends to release in 
part. 
23. 
MEETING DOCUMENTS - Based on the experience and training of myself and 
other staff involved in searching for records, it was determined that a search of staff emails would 
be the most likely way to locate records responsive to the request for "[d]ocuments showing when 
MCC staff held meetings regarding Jeffrey Epstein, and who attended." The email search is 
described in Paragraphs 44-46, infra. Additional searches for meetings documents are described 
in the Declaraton of Nicole McFarland (the "McFarland Declaration"). 
24. 
SUICIDE WATCH REMOVAL MEETING DOCUMENTS - Based on the 
experience and training of myself and other staff involved in searching for records, it was 
determined that a search of staff emails would be the most likely way to locate records responsive 
to the request for "[a]ll records generated from the meeting at MCC during which it was decided 
that Jeffrey Epstein would be taken off suicide watch." The email search is described in 
Paragraphs 44-46, infra. Additional searches for meetings documents are described in the 
McFarland Declaration. 
25. 
POST- WATCH REPORT - Based on the experience and training of myself and 
other staff involved in searching for records, it was determined that a search of staff emails and 
BEMR were the most likely ways to locate "the Post-Watch report compiled in order to take Jeffrey 
Epstein off suicide watch." The email search is described in Paragraphs 44-46, infra and the 
BEMR search is described in Paragraph 21 supra. The BOP located the psychological records 
EFTA00015371
--- PAGE 12 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 24 Filed 08/05/20 Page 12 of 34 
for Epstein from BEMR, including a post-suicide watch report for Epstein prepared as part of his 
removal from suicide watch, which was withheld in full, as noted in the attached index at Entry 
19. 
26. 
OVERTIME SIGN-UP SHEETS - Based on the experience and training of 
myself and other staff involved in searching for records, it was determined that a search of the 
Roster/Overtime Program was the most likely place where "[t]he overtime sign-up sheets for the 
Special Housing Unit (9 South) at MCC for Aug. 9 and 10, and on July 22 and 23" would be 
located. The Roster/Overtime Program is a web based program that allows staff to submit 
overtime requests, submit Quarterly Preferences, view Daily Assignments, and view the 
Mandatory Overtime List. The search returned the MCC daily assignment rosters for August 9 
and 10, 2019, and July 22 and 23, 2019, which were withheld in full, except for one page released 
in part from each roster on June 22, 2020, as noted in the attached index at Entries 7-9. 
27. 
STAFF AUGMENTING RECORDS - Based on the experience and training of 
myself and other staff involved in searching for records, it was determined that a search of the 
Roster/Overtime Program was the most likely place where "Documents showing which staff were 
augmented at MCC and what positions they worked in on Aug. 9 and 10, and on July 22 and 23" 
would be located. The search returned the MCC daily assignment rosters for August 9 and 10, 
2019, and July 22 and 23, 2019, which were withheld in full, except for one page released in part 
from each roster on June 22, 2020, as noted in the attached index at Entries 7-9. 
28. 
VIDEO CAMERA FOOTAGE - Based on the experience and training of myself 
and other staff involved in searching for records, it was determined that the Special Investigativer 
Agent's (SIA) office was the most likely place where video camera footage responsive to the 
EFTA00015372
--- PAGE 13 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 24 Filed 08/05/20 Page 13 of 34 
request for lap video camera footage at MCC pertinent to the Jeffrey Epstein suicide and the 
first suicide attempt" would be located. After consulting with the custodian for such records, it 
was determined that the BOP does not have possession of responsive records because all 
video/NICE vision equipment was handed over to the FBI on or about August 10, 2019. 
29. 
The BOP sought to preserve video footage from July 23, 2019, the night of 
Epstein's apparent suicide attempt, pursuant to a preservation request in a criminal case. 
However, the BOP inadvertently preserved footage showing a different area within MCC, and the 
video footage from the SHU at MCC no longer exists on the backup system because of a technical 
error. See Letter from the Government dated January 9, 2020, Dkt. No. 182, United States v. 
Tartaglione, No. 16-cr-832 (KMK). 
30. 
SUICIDE ATTEMPT AND SUICIDE RECORDS - Based on the experience 
and training of myself and other staff involved in searching for records, it was determined that a 
search of the Bureau Electronic Medical Record (BEMR) and a search for Forms 583 and related 
documents were the best methods to locate records responsive to the request for "[Ill BOP 
documents pertaining to Jeffrey Epstein's suicide and first suicide attempt." To locate medical 
and psychological records responsive to this request, BOP searched BEMR. GOP's BEMR 
search is detailed supra at Paragraph 21. The psychological records were withheld in full, as noted 
on the attached index at Entry 19. BOP is currently revewing the remaining BEMR records to 
segregate non-exempt information and intends to release the records in part. 
31. 
With regard to the Form 583 and related documents, MCC Staff located the Form 
583 and related documents concerning Epstein's apparent suicide attempt on July 23, 2019 as 
described in the McFarland Declaration. Because staff at MCC New York did not have access to 
EFTA00015373
--- PAGE 14 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 24 Filed 08/05/20 Page 14 of 34 
the Form 583 and related documents concerning Epstein's suicide on August 10, 2019, I requested 
these records from the Correctional Programs Division in the Central Office of the Bureau of 
Prisons (BOP). Based on my knowledge and experience, I am aware that the Correctional 
Programs Division (CPD) has access to all Form 583s and related documents regardless of the 
institution that created the Form 583 as they are the Division that has overall responsibility for all 
Correctional Services Departments in the BOP. Accordingly, once I became aware staff at MCC 
New York no longer had access to the Form 583 and related documents from August 10, 2019, 
knowing that the CPD was the location most reasonably expected to maintain the Form 583 and 
related documents concerning Epstein's suicide on August 10, 2019, I requested, and received, the 
records from them. The 583 Forms were withheld in full, as noted in the attached Index at Entries 
and 18. 
32. 
BOP staff also located additional reports prepared following Epstein's apparent 
suicide attempt and Epstein's suicide, including a psychological reconstruction of inmate death 
and responses thereto, including a memorandum; a document titled MCC New York Updates; draft 
letters to Epstein's brother, Chief Judge McMahon and Judge Berman; a letter to the MCC warden 
dated August 14, 2019; photo sheets from Epstein's July 23, 2019 apparent suicide attempt and 
Epstein's August 10, 2019 suicide, a chain of custody form from Epstein's July 23 apparent suicide 
attempt, reports of the July 23, 2019 apparent suicide attempt, memoranda and reports of Epstein's 
August 10, 2019 suicide. MCC staff located these documents by manually searching their files for 
records pertaining to Epstein's July 23, 2019 apparent suicide attempt and Epstein's August 10, 
2019 suicide. These records were withheld in full or withheld in part as noted in the attached Index 
at Entries 2, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 20, 35, and 36.

Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 24 Filed 08/05/20 Page 15 of 34 
33. 
SUICIDE WATCH REMOVAL DOCUMENTS - Based on the experience and 
training of myself and other staff involved in searching for records, it was determined that, in 
addition to any records that may exist in the BEMR for inmate Epstein, a search of staff emails 
was the other place where records responsive to the request for 101 BOP documents, including 
email correspondence and meeting minutes, pertaining to the decision to remove Jeffrey Epstein 
from suicide watch" would be. The email search is described in Paragraphs 44-46, infra and the 
scope and results of the BEMR search are described in Paragraph 28 supra. These records were 
withheld in full as noted in the attached Index at Entries 19 and 52. Additional searches for 
documents pertaining to the decision to remove Epstein from suicide watch are described in the 
McFarland Declaration. 
34. 
SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE REPORTS - Based on the experience and training 
of myself and other staff involved in searching for records, it was determined that a search of the 
BOP Special Investigative Section ("SIS") database known as TRUINTEL was the best way to 
locate records responsive to the request for "[a]ll BOP special investigation reports mentioning 
Jeffrey Epstein." The SIS database contains information related to investigation of both inmates 
and staff. To search the SIS database for special investigation reports about inmate Epstein, staff 
used inmate Epstein's unique inmate register number of 76318-054 to retrieve any and all special 
investigative reports maintained by the BOP about inmate Epstein. The search returned one 
Inmate Investigative Report for inmate Epstein, which was withheld in full, as noted on the 
attached index at Entry 9. 
35. 
CORRESPONDENCE - Based on the experience and training of myself and other 
staff involved in searching for records, it was determined that a search of staff emails was the most 
EFTA00015375
--- PAGE 16 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 24 Filed 08/05/20 Page 16 of 34 
effective way to locate records responsive to the request for "[a]It BOP correspondence with the 
U.S. Attorney's Office regarding Jeffrey Epstein." The email search is described in Paragraphs 
44-46, infra. 
36. 
PHONE LOGS - Based on the experience and training of myself and other staff 
involved in searching for records, it was determined that a search of the TRUVIEW database was 
the most likely place where a "full log of Mr. Epstein's phone calls to and from the MCC" would 
be located. Regarding inmate telephone calls, TRUVIEW contains a list of all people who were 
approved to be on inmate Epstein's telephone list, and it also has a log of all inmate telephone calls 
not made on a legal line. To search TRUVIEW for inmate related information, staff used Jeffrey 
Epstein's unique inmate register number of 76318-054 to retrieve all of his telephone call 
information. The search returned the Federal Bureau of Prisons/TRUVIEW/Inmate Center 
Report for inmate Epstein, produced to Plaintiff with redactions on June 22, 2019. 
37. 
EMAIL COMMUNICATIONS - Based on the experience and training of myself 
and other staff involved in searching for records, it was determined that the TRULINCS database 
was the most likely place where "[a]ll email correspondence to and from Mr. Epstein while he was 
at the MCC (including any correspondence through the Corrlinks system or any other email system 
he had access to[]" would be located. TRULINCS is a BOP database that is comprised of two 
main components. One component is the inmate application used solely by the inmates and 
provides inmates the capability to manage their contact list for emails, communicate with members 
of the public on an inmate's contact list via email, and communicate with staff. To search 
TRULINCS for inmate related information, staff used Jeffrey Epstein's unique inmate register 
number of 76318-054 to check for email communications to and from inmate Epstein. The search 
EFTA00015376
--- PAGE 17 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 24 Filed 08/05/20 Page 17 of 34 
did not return any results for emails to/from Epstein's TRULINCS account - either to/from any 
member of the public or to/from staff. 
38. 
VISITOR LOGS - Based on the experience and training of myself and other staff 
involved in searching for records, it was determined that a search of the TRUVIEW database was 
the most likely place where "[t]he full log of people who visited Mr. Epstein while he was at the 
MCC and when they visited" would be located. Regarding inmate visitors, the TRUVIEW 
contains a log of all inmate visits. To search TRUVIEW for inmate related information, staff 
used Jeffrey Epstein's unique inmate register number of 76318-054 to retrieve all of his visitor 
information. The search returned the Federal Bureau of Prisons/TRUVIEW/Inmate Center Report 
for inmate Epstein, produced to Plaintiff with redactions on June 22, 2019. 
39. 
In addition, staff at MCC searched for physical visitor logs and located one log 
book showing a visitor for Jeffrey Epstein on July 30, 2019. A copy of the page from the log 
book showing this visit was produced to the Plaintif with redactions on June 22, 2019. All other 
physical visitor logs were handed over to the OIG on or about August 22, 2019, and the BOP is no 
longer in possession of these logs. 
40. 
VISITOR LISTS - Based on the experience and training of myself and other staff 
involved in searching for records, it was determined that a search of the TRUVIEW database was 
the most likely place where "[t]he full list of people that Mr. Epstein had requested to be on his 
approved visitor list." would be located. To search TRUVIEW for inmate related information, 
staff used Jeffrey Epstein's unique inmate register number of 76318-054 to retrieve all of his visitor 
information. The search returned the Federal Bureau of Prisons/TRUVIEW/Inmate Center 
Report for inmate Epstein, produced to Plaintiff with redactions on June 22, 2019.

41. 
EMAIL LIST - Based on the experience and training of myself and other staff 
involved in searching for records, it was determined that a search of the TRUVIEW database was 
the most likely place where "[t]he full list of people that Mr. Epstein had requested to be on his 
approved email correspondence list" would be located. To search TRUVIEW for inmate related 
information, staff used Jeffrey Epstein's unique inmate register number of 76318-054 to retrieve 
all 
of 
his 
visitor 
information. 
The search 
returned 
the 
Federal 
Bureau 
of 
Prisons/TRUVIEW/Inmate Center Report for inmate Epstein, produced to Plaintiff with redactions 
on June 22, 2019. 
42. 
APPROVED CALL LIST- Based on the experience and training of myself and 
other staff involved in searching for records, it was determined that a search of the TRUVIEW 
database was the most likely place where "[t]he full list of people that Mr. Epstein had requested 
to be on his approved call list" would be located. Regarding inmate approved call lists, the 
TRUVIEW database contains a log of all people who are approved to be on an inmate's call list. 
To search TRUVIEW for inmate related information, staff used Jeffrey Epstein's unique inmate 
register number of 76318-054 to retrieve all of his visitor information. The search returned the 
Federal Bureau of Prisons/TRUVIEW/Inmate Center Report for inmate Epstein, produced to 
Plaintiff with redactions on June 22, 2019. 
43. 
RECORDINGS OF TELEPHONE CALLS - Based on the experience and 
training of myself and other staff involved in searching for records, it was determined that the 
TRUVIEW database was the most likely place where the approved call list information for inmate 
Epstein would be located to determine if there were any "recordings of the last three phone 
conversations that Mr. Epstein had." To search TRUVIEW for inmate related information. staff 
EFTA00015378
--- PAGE 19 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 24 Filed 08/05/20 Page 19 of 34 
used Jeffrey Epstein's unique inmate register number of 76318-054 to retrieve all of his call 
information. The search returned the Federal Bureau of Prisons/TRUVIEW/Inmate Center 
Report for inmate Epstein, produced to Plaintiff with redactions on June 22, 2019. Epstein did 
not have any calls listed there, and so no recordings of Epstein's calls were located. As noted 
above, Epstein did make telephone calls on the legal line at the MCC, but these calls were 
unmonitored, unrecorded and not logged in TRUVIEW, such that there is no system to search for 
records of them. 
III. BOP'S EMAIL SEARCH 
44. 
Below is a description of the email search for records as it relates to requests for 
which a search of email records was conducted, as noted above. Based on the experience and 
training of myself and other staff involved in searching for records, it was determined that a 
search of the BOP's GROUPWISE email system was appropriate as GROUPWISE is the BOP's 
email client platform for staff. Based on the scope of the requests, the GROUPWISE email 
accounts for the below identified BOP staff was the most likely place where communications 
about inmate Epstein would likely be located, as these BOP staff were key decision makers at 
the institution, regional, and central office levels of the BOP and were likely involved and likely 
made recommendations about Mr. Epstein's classification while he was confined at MCC New 
York. The email search was conducted using both the staff member's name and his or her 
unique BOP identifier and other particularized search terms based on the Plaintiff's FOIA 
Requests. The staff whose emails were searched were as follows: 
(1) 
Acting Director Hurwitz; 
(2) 
Former Regional Director Johnathan Ray Ormond; 
(3) 
Regional Counsel Darrin Howard; 
EFTA00015379

(4) 
Deputy Regional Counsel Adam Johnson; 
(5) 
Correctional Programs Administrator Sukenna Stokes; 
(6) 
Warden Laraine N'Diaye; 
(7) 
Associate Warden Shirley Skipper Scott; 
(8) 
Associate Warden Charisma Edge; 
(9) 
Associate Warden Brian Best; 
(10) 
Executive Assistant Lee Plourde; 
(11) 
Supervisory Attorney Nicole McFarland; 
12) 
Captain Jermaine Darden; and 
(13) 
Chief of Psychology Elissa Miller. 
45. 
Based on the scope of the FOIA request, the search terms used for the search and 
the date range for the search were as follows: 
(1) 
Jeffrey Epstein, 76318-054, MCC, New York, meetings, suicide watch, 
suicide, AUSA, USAO and 
(2) 
7/6/2019 (Date Epstein went into custody at MCC) through 1/9/2020 (the 
date of Complainant's last FOIA Request). 
46. 
The email search produced 1911 records, which totaled 18,062 pages. After 
review of the records, it was determined that 3176 pages of these records were responsive and 
non-duplicative. 
III. APPLICATION OF EXEMPTIONS 
Segregability 
47. I and other FOIA staff reviewed and continue to review the records located in 
response to Plaintiff's FOIA requests to determine whether or not there is any non-exempt 
information in the records that could be reasonably segregated and released. We have already 
determind that 584 pages contain such information, and those pages were released, with 
appropriate redactions, to Plaintiff on June 22, July 7, and July 10. Other than these 584 pages 
EFTA00015380
--- PAGE 21 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 24 Filed 08/05/20 Page 21 of 34 
and the records listed as withheld in full on the attached index, I and other FOIA staff continue to 
review the remaining records because we currently believe that they contain segregable 
information, such that the additional records could be released in part. Each of the records 
withheld in full includes exempt information that is inextricably intertwined with any non-
exempt information in the document, such that segregating any non-exempt information would 
be of little to no informational value. 
48. All of the responsive records withheld in full by BOP are withheld under FOIA 
Exemption 7(A), except for the 2 pages of draft letters at Entry 11 of the attached index and the 
pages of email records at Entry 54 of the attached index, withheld under Exemption 5 and 
discussed below. The basis for withholdings under Exemption 7(A) is explained in the 
accompanying declaration of Counsel to the Acting United States Attorney Russell Capone. In 
addition to the withholdings in full under Exemptions 7(A) and 5, BOP has also withheld certain 
records or portions of records under Exemptions 5, 6, 7(A), 7(C), 7(E), and 7(F). 
A. 
Withholdings under Exemption 5 
49. 
Title 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(5) ("Exemption 5") excludes from disclosure "inter-
agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party . 
.. in litigation with the agency." 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(5). Exemption 5 incorporates all the normal 
civil discovery privileges, including the deliberative process privilege andand the attorney-client 
privilege. BOP has withheld records in full and in part under the deliberative process privilege. 
As noted in the attached index, BOP has withheld in full under the deliberative process privilege 
the incident report for Epstein's July 23, 2019 apparent suicide attempt, the psychological 
EFTA00015381
--- PAGE 22 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 24 Filed 08/05/20 Page 22 of 34 
reconstruction of Epstein's suicide and responses thereto, and draft letters to Epstein's brother 
and Chief Judge McMahon and Judge Berman. 
a. The incident report for Epstein's July 23, 2019, apparent suicide attempt is 
predecisional because it preceded the decisions to remove Epstein from 
suicide watch and to house him in a particular cell in the SHU with a cellmate. 
Decisions concerning cell designation for inmates and whether to cell an 
inmate with another inmate or with a particular inmate are policy decisions 
involving open and frank conversations by senior BOP staff to include 
security staff, medical staff, unit staff, and executive staff. These discussions 
are particularly amplified when dealing with high profile inmates and for 
which the inmate's incarceration with the BOP is the subject of great media 
and public attention. Thus, the incident report was prepared to assist BOP in 
making those decisions because it documents details of Epstein's apparent 
suicide attempt that were relevant to the determination of whether he would be 
removed from suicide watch and how and where he would be housed 
thereafter. It was deliberative because it bears on the exercise of a policy-
oriented judgment by assisting in the application of GOP's policies of 
releasing certin inmates from suicide watch and housing them in specific 
circumstances based on details of their psychological profile and any suicide 
attempt. Release of the incident report would hamper BOP employees' 
abilities to frankly discuss the circumstances of suicide attempts and assess 
GOP's suicide prevention policies. 
b. The psychological reconstruction of Epstein's suicide and responses thereto 
are predecisional because they preceded GOP's decisions regarding how to 
respond to Epstein's suicide and was prepared to assist in deciding which 
actions to take. Specifically, the psychological reconstruction report was part 
of a review by BOP following Epstein's suicide of MCC's suicide prevention 
policies, including a determination of whether MCC's suicide prevention 
policies needed to be changed. It was also part of a review to determine 
whether or not wider changes, such as changes in personnel or leadership at 
MCC, were necessary. Further, the purpose of the report is to provide Senior 
BOP staff information for which to consider future policy considerations 
throughout the BOP concerning the care and custody of inmates. Thus, these 
reports are ultimately recommendations in that they not only point out factual 
information, but with this factual information Senior BOP staff are able to 
consider strategic initiatives. The report is deliberative because it contains 
multiple recommendations—and responses to certain recommendations-for 
how MCC should change its suicide preventation policies and measures, 
including, for example, recommendations about double-ceiling and direct 
observation of inmates, duration of suicide watches, how to structure such 
EFTA00015382
--- PAGE 23 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 24 Filed 08/05/20 Page 23 of 34 
watches. These recommendations are used by Senior BOP officials in terms 
of policy considerations that impact BOP operations across facilities. 
Further, any such recommendations are discussed by Senior BOP officials and 
as such requires the frank and open assessment by these officials in reaching a 
decision to adopt a policy recommendation. Release of the report would 
hamper frank and open discussions and assessments by these officials in 
reaching policy decisions. 
c. The draft letters are predecisional because they were prepared in advance of 
final letters sent to individuals and to assist in determining the content of the 
final letters, Agency formal letters are purposed as final Agency policy 
directives and members of the public and press view Agency letters no 
differently than officially adopted policy statements. As such, draft letters 
are not the Agency's final response and like other policy related documents, 
Agency letters are not an official statement of the Agency until a final letter is 
prepared and dispatched They are deliberative because they bear on the 
exercise of a policy-oriented judgment in that they are part of BOP's 
determination of how best to inform family members and other relevant 
parties of the death of an inmate. Their release would harm BOP's ability to 
determine how best to inform family members and other relevant parties of 
the death of an inmate. 
Certain email records have also been withheld in part under the 
deliberative process privilege. 
d. One category of emails pertains to Epstein's July 23, 2019, apparent suicide 
attempt and incarceration. These emails are predecisional because they were 
prepared to assist BOP in making decisions about Epstien's incarceration, 
including whether he would remain -on suicide watch and whether he would 
be housed with a cellmate. They are deliberative because they bear on the 
exercise of a policy-oriented judgment, namely the application of BOP's 
policies of releasing certin inmates from suicide watch and housing them 
under particularized housing measures, including based on details of their 
psychological profile and any suicide attempt. The decision to place an 
inmate on suicide watch or to remove an inmate from suicide watch involves 
involves policy deliberations from several BOP senior level stakteholders 
from medical staff, psychology staff, Correctional Program Division Staff, 
security staff, and executive staff. Release of the information in these emails 
would hamper BOP's employees' ability to frankly discuss decisions 
regarding placing inmates on and removing inmates from suicide watch and to 
discuss suicide prevention policies. 
EFTA00015383
--- PAGE 24 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 24 Filed 08/05/20 Page 24 of 34 
e. One category of emails pertains to press inquiries concerning Epstein and his 
death and how BOP will respond to them. They are predecisional because 
they were prepared in advance of GOP's decisions regarding whether and how 
to change policies at MCC, including suicide prevent policies, following 
Epstein's death and in advance of GOP's decisions regarding whether and 
how to respond to press inquiries about Epstein. They were prepared to assist 
in how deciding how BOP would respond to inquiries because they are 
communications, including deliberations, between BOP employees about how 
to respond. They are deliberative because they consist of GOP's 
considerations of how to respond and include drafts of responses to press 
inquiries and discusions of what responses should be provided. They are also 
deliberative because they bear on GOP's decisions regarding whether and how 
polcies at MCC, including suicide prevention policies, should change, in that 
they include details of Epstein's death, the response or reaction of BOP 
employees to details of Epstein's death, and discussion of steps taken at MCC 
following Epstein's death, including responding to press inquiries. Release of 
the information in these emails would hamper GOP's decisionmaking 
processes in determining how to communicate with the press and its 
assessment of policies at facilities where suicides occur. 
f. One category of emails pertains to Epstein's suicide and GOP's response to 
Epstein's suicide. They are predecisional because they preceded GOP's 
decisions regarding how to respond to Epstein's suicide and were prepared to 
assist in deciding -areas of policy consideration for the GOP's suicide 
preventation strategies. 
Specifically, they relate to deliberations within BOP 
and MCC following Epstein's suicide about MCC's policies, including its 
suicide prevention policies. They are deliberative because they include 
communications that were part of a review to determine whether or not policy 
changes, such as changes in suicide perevention policies, personnel or 
leadership at MCC, were necessary. Release of the emails would hamper BOP 
employees' frank discussion of suicide prevention policies (and leadership 
and personnel decisions) at its facilities and whether it is necessary to change 
these policies (or leadership or personnel). 
50. As indicated at Entry 54 in the attached index, one 56-page set of emails was 
withheld in full under the attorney-client privilege. This group of withheld emails consists of 
communications between BOP employees and GOP's attorneys, Assistant United States 
Attorneys in the Civil Division of the USAO-SDNY, concerning requests for documents related 
EFTA00015384
--- PAGE 25 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 24 Filed 08/05/20 Page 25 of 34 
to Epstein, preservation of documents related to Epstein, and how to respond to requests pursuant 
to Department of Justice regulations (known as Touhy regulations). As communications 
between attorneys and a client, these emails were properly withheld under Exemption 5. Release 
of these emails would negatively affect BOP's ability to seek out and receive frank legal counsel. 
Threshold Justification For Application of Exemption 7 
51. As a threshold to applying Exemption 7, an agency has to demonstrate that the 
"records or information [were] compiled for law enforcement purposes." 5 U.S.C. §552(b)(7). 
52. The BOP is a law enforcement agency. The term "law enforcement officer" is defined 
as "an employee of the Bureau of Prisons or Federal Prison Industries, Inc." See, e.g, 5 U.S.C. 
§ 8401(17)(D)(i). Furthermore, BOP employees perform law enforcement functions. They 
possess the authority to make arrests, 18 U.S.C. § 3050; seize evidence, 18 U.S.C. § 4012; and 
execute searches on inmates and visitors to the institution, 28 C.F.R. §§ 511.10-511.12, 552.10-
552.14. 
Additionally, the BOP is tasked with the law enforcement mission of protecting inmates, 
staff, and the community. See 18 U.S.C. § 4042(a)(1)-(3) ("The Bureau of Prisons, under the 
direction of the Attorney General, shall (1) have charge of the management and regulation of all 
Federal penal and correctional institutions; (2) provide suitable quarters and provide for the 
safekeeping, care, and subsistence of all persons charged with or convicted of offenses against the 
United States, or held as witnesses or otherwise; (3) provide for the protection, instruction, and 
discipline of all persons charged with or convicted of offenses against the United States . . . ."). 
53. All of the records withheld in full or in part were compiled for law enforcement 
purposes because they were compiled in the exercise of BOP's statutory authority to detain 
arrested individuals before trial pursuant to a judicial order. All of these records relate to a 
EFTA00015385
--- PAGE 26 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 24 Filed 08/05/20 Page 26 of 34 
specifically identified inmate and concern the conditions of his incarceration (including his 
housing location, medical records, visitor lists, security designation, staff decisions concerning 
the inmate's status at MCC New York, and the like). They were compiled in order to carry out 
BOP's responsibilities to protect the safety, security, and orderly operation of BOP facilities, 
specifically MCC New York, to protect the public, and/or to protect the safety and care of the 
inmate who is the subject of the records in question. In addition, some of the records were 
compiled as part of the investigations into Epstein's incarceration and death and serve as 
investigatory tools. Some were also compiled for the specific law enforcement of purpose of 
preventing suicides at BOP facilities and ensuring the safety of inmates in BOP facilities. The 
records at issue in this FOIA request meet the law enforcement threshold of Exemption (b)(7). 
Records Withheld Pursuant to Exemptions 6 and 7(C) 
54. 
U.S.C. § 552(b)(6), ("FOIA Exemption 6"), protects from disclosure "personnel 
and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted 
invasion of personal privacy." 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(6). 
55. 
U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(C) ("Exemption 7(C)") exempts from disclosure records or 
information compiled for law enforcement purposes where its production "could reasonably be 
expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy." 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(C). 
56. 
Some of the records withheld by BOP contain contain personal information 
withheld in part under Exemptions 6 and 7(C) (the "6 & 7(C) Records"). The 6 & 7(C) Records 
include personnel files within the meaning of Exemption 6, such as overtime logs for the MCC. 
The remainder of the 6 & 7(C) records are "similar files" within the meaning of Exemption 6 
because they contain information about particular, identifiable individuals. This information 
EFTA00015386
--- PAGE 27 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 24 Filed 08/05/20 Page 27 of 34 
includes personally identifying information, such as names and contact information, of various 
third-party individuals other than Epstein. 
57. 
Exemptions 6 and 7(C) each require a balancing of the privacy interests 
implicated by disclosure of a record with the public interest in its disclosure. The privacy 
interests implicated by the 6 & 7(C) Records include the privacy interests of BOP employees, 
BOP inmates other than Epstein, Epstein's surviving family members, visitors or senders of 
funds to BOP inmates, legal counsel for BOP inmates, USAO-SDNY employees, and journalists. 
The 6 & 7(C) Records contain personally identifying information, such as names and contact 
information, for each of these categories of individuals and detail their association with Epstein 
or their involvement or interest in Epstein's incarceration, death, or the response of BOP or the 
USAO-SDNY to Epstein's death. Release of this information - particularly in light of the 
intense media interest in and public speculation concerning Epstein's death - could reasonably be 
expected to expose these third parties to unwanted scrutiny, embarrassment, and even harassment 
or retaliation. 
58. 
The sole public interest to be weighed against these privacy interests under both 
Exemption 6 and 7(C) is the public's understanding of government operations. The personal 
information withheld from the 6 and 7(C) Records will not significantly contribute to the 
public's understanding of the operation or activities of the government or further the purpose of 
the FOIA by informing the public of the government's activities. The withheld personal 
information does not provide significant insight into government activities or operations in 
connection with Epstein's incarceration or the response of BOP, the USAO-SDNY, or any other 
government agency to Epstein's death. For example, the names of BOP employees in the 
EFTA00015387
--- PAGE 28 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 24 Filed 08/05/20 Page 28 of 34 
withheld records do not provide members of the public with a greater understanding of how BOP 
works. 
59. 
The large volume of publicity and often unfounded speculation concerning the 
circumstances of Epstein's death increase the likelihood that disclosure of the information 
withhed under Exemptions 6 and 7(C) would cause an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. 
60. 
In light of the public and unfounded speculation on Epstein's death and the media 
coverage thereof, it is reasonable to expect that individuals identified through disclosures by the 
government as associated with Epstein's incarceration and death, or investigation of the charges 
against Epstein or the circumstances of his death, could be targeted or harassed. Accordingly, 
publicizing the identity, contact information, or other personal information of a particular 
individual's associations or interactions with Epstein, or participation in the investigation of and 
response to his death, will amount to a significant invasion of personal privacy, with no 
meaningful contribution to the public's understanding of how the government works. 
61. 
For each category of individuals with personally identifying information present 
in the 6 & 7(C) Records, the individual privacy concerns outweigh the putative public interest in 
their disclosure. 
a. The disclosure of personally identifying information of BOP employees, such 
as their names or contact information, would significantly invade their 
personal privacy without contributing to a public understanding of how BOP 
works. As noted above, disclosing the names or contact information of BOP 
employees does not provide insight into how BOP works because individual 
employees' names or contact information are not relevant to how BOP works. 
b. The disclosure of personally identifying information of BOP inmates, such as 
their names or contact information, would significantly invade their personal 
privacy without contributing to a public understanding of how BOP works. 
EFTA00015388
--- PAGE 29 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 24 Filed 08/05/20 Page 29 of 34 
The names or contact information of particular inmates is not relevant to and 
provides no greater understanding of how BOP works. 
c. The disclosure of personally identifying information of visitors or senders of 
funds to BOP inmates, such as their names and contact information, would 
significantly invade their personal privacy without contributing to a public 
understanding of how the government works: identification of the individuals 
who visited or sent money to Epstein or other inmates does not shed light on 
BOP conduct or how BOP or any other government agency works. 
d. The disclosure of personally identifying information of legal counsel to 
Epstein and other BOP inmates, such as their names and contact information, 
would significantly invade their personal privacy without contributing to a 
public understanding of how the government works: identification of counsel 
to Epstein and other inmates does not shed light on BOP conduct or how BOP 
or any other government agency works. 
e. The disclosure of personally identifying information of USAO-SDNY 
employees, such as their names and contact information, would significantly 
invade their personal privacy without contributing to a public understanding 
of how the USAO-SDNY works: the particular names or contact information 
of USAO-SDNY employees is not relevant to and does not provide any 
insight into how the USAO-SDNY operates. 
f. The disclosure of personally identifying information of journalists, such as 
their names and contact information, would significantly invade their personal 
privacy without contributing to a public understanding of how the government 
works: the provision of information about journalistic approaches to gathering 
information is not a public interest protected by Exemption 6 or 7(C). 
62. Some of the 6 & 7(C) Records also contain information implicating the privacy 
interests of Epstein's surviving family. These records contain highly personal details about 
Epstein's suicide, including graphic images of his body after he committed suicide. Release of 
images of a deceased family member's body and the details of his suicide could reasonably be 
expected to cause hardship and pain to surviving family members by interfering with their 
mourning or remembering of the deceased person. The publicity and unfounded speculation 
surrounding Epstein's death would heighten this risk of hardship and pain. The release of records 
EFTA00015389
--- PAGE 30 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 24 Filed 08/05/20 Page 30 of 34 
containing highly personal details about Epstein's suicide, such as photographs of his body, 
would clearly constitute (and, at a minimum, could reasonably be expected to constitute) an 
unwarranted invasion of his family members' personal privacy. Such details about Epstein's 
suicide provide no significant information to the public about how the government works. 
63. 
The release of the personally identifying information in the 6 & 7(C) records 
would clearly constitute (and, at a minimum, could reasonably be expected to constitute) an 
unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of of BOP employees, BOP inmates other than 
Epstein, Epstein's surviving family members, visitors or senders of funds to BOP inmates, legal 
counsel for BOP inmates, USAO-SDNY employees, or journalists. 
Records Withheld Pursuant to Exemption 7(E) 
64. 
Title 5 U.S.C. § 522 (b)(7)(E) ("Exemption 7(E)") exempts from disclosure 
"records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the 
production of such law enforcement records or information ... would disclose techniques and 
procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for 
law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected 
to risk circumvention of the law." 
65. 
Some of the records withheld by BOP contain information or discussion of law 
enforcement techniques and procedures or guidelines for law enforcement investigations or 
prosecutions, as indicated on the attached index (the "7(E) Records"). As explained above, all 
of the records withheld in full or in part, including the 7(E) Records, were compiled for law 
enforcement purposes, including the incarceration of Epstein or other inmates and the 
investigation of the circumstances of Epstein's death. 
EFTA00015390
--- PAGE 31 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 24 Filed 08/05/20 Page 31 of 34 
66. 
The 7(E) Records fall wholly or in part within the scope of Exemption 7(E) 
because they include information or discussions that would disclose law enforcement techniques 
and procedures and their use in investigating incidents that occurred during Epstein's 
incarceration, including his suicide. Specifically, in terms of non-email records, as noted in the 
attached index, the psychological reconstruction of Epstein's suicide and responses thereto 
would disclose GOP's techniques and procedures in investigating inmate suicides. More 
specifically, disclosure of this report will reveal the specific techniques the BOP uses to 
reconstruct a suicide to include its information and evidence gathering strategies. Revealing this 
information to third parties will allow inmates the ability to learn how to manufacture and then 
subsequently disguise their instruments used to commit suicide. When inmates are armed with 
this information, it will prevent staff from locating these instruments during the routine course of 
cell checks and contraband searches. This will lead to more suicide attempts and ultimately, 
successful suicides by inmates. 
67. 
The Inmate Investigative Report would disclose GOP's techniques and procedure 
in investigating incidents involving inmates, which could lead to inmates taking actions to 
circumvent GOP's investigatory techniques. The MCC New York Updates would disclose how 
BOP investigates and tracks certain incidents and events within its facilities. The letter to the 
MCC warden regarding a visit by an after action team would disclose GOP's investigatory 
techiniques and procedures for investigating inmate suicides. The photo sheets from Epstein's 
July 23 apparent suicide attempt, a chain of custody form from Epstein's July 23 apparent 
suicide attempt, memoranda and reports of the July 23 apparent suicide attempt, and the Form 
583 for Epstein's apparent suicide attempt would disclose GOP's investigatory techniques and 
EFTA00015391
--- PAGE 32 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 24 Filed 08/05/20 Page 32 of 34 
procedures for investigating inmate suicide attempts. The release of the same will permit 
inmates to circumvent detection by staff of potential risks of suicides and thus increase the risk 
inmates will successfully commit suicide. Suicide attempts and successful suicides not only 
create a risk of danger and harm to the inmate attempting a suicide, but also place an inmate's 
cellmate in danger and place staff who respond to the attempted suicide or completed suicide in 
danger. 
68. 
Certain email records also contain information falling within the scope of 
Exemption 7(E). First, some emails pertaining to Epstein's July 23, 2019, apparent suicide 
attempt and his incarceration at MCC New York contain information that would would disclose 
BOP's investigatory techniques and procedures for investigating inmate suicide attempts. The 
release of the same will permit inmates to circumvent detection by staff of potential risks of 
suicides and thus increase the risk that an inmate will successful commit suicide. Second, some 
emails pertaining to Epstein's suicide and BOP's response to Epstein's suicide contain 
information that would disclose BOP's investigatory techniques and procedures for investigating 
inmate suicides. 
Records Withheld Pursuant to Exemption 7(F) 
69. 
Title 5 U.S.C. § 522 (b)(7)(F) ("Exemption 7(F)") exempts from disclosure 
"records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the 
production of such law enforcement records or information ... could reasonably be expected to 
endanger the life or physical safety of any individual." 
70. 
Some of the records withheld by BOP contain the personally identifying 
information, such as names and contact information, of third-party individuals involved in law 
EFTA00015392
--- PAGE 33 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 24 Filed 08/05/20 Page 33 of 34 
enforcement investigations, as indicated on the index prepared by BOP (the "7(F) Records"). 
Each of the 7(F) Records were compiled for law enforcement purposes, namely the incarceration 
of Epstein or the response of the USAO-SDNY and BOP to Epstein's death. 
71. 
The 7(F) Records fall in part within the scope of Exemption 7(F) because the 
release of the personally identifying information contained in these records could reasonably be 
expected to endanger the life or physical safety of BOP employees and USAO-SDNY employees 
whose personally identifying information is contained in the 7(F) Records. BOP and USAO-
SDNY employees work with inmate and criminal defendants who, upon their release from 
incarceration or during their incarceration, might target BOP or USAO-SDNY employees for 
reprisal, who in many metropolitan cities live in the cities where they work, who frequently 
utilize public transportation, and who regularly engage in community and social activities in 
those cities. The release of personally identifying information of BOP or SDNY-USAO 
employees increases the risks of such targeting or harassment because it would make it easier for 
identified employees to be targeted or harassed. Because of the attention and speculation 
surrounding Epstein's death, it is reasonable to expect that individuals identified through 
disclosures by the government as associated with Epstein's incarceration and death, investigating 
the charges against Epstein, or investigating the circumstances of Epstein's death could be 
targeted. 
Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746. I declare under the penalty of perjury that the foregoing is 
true and correct.

FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT REQUEST 
Dear FOIA Officer: 
Requested records 
"Records" means information of any kind, including writings (handwritten, typed, electronic or otherwise 
produced, reproduced or stored), letters, memoranda, correspondence, notes, applications, completed 
forms, studies, reports, reviews, telephone conversations, faxes, emails, documents, photographs,

minutes of meetings, records of meetings in any form, and any other compilation of data from which 
information can be obtained. All of the foregoing are included in this request if they are in the 
possession of or otherwise under the New York Times requests for Records of the following type in the 
possession, custody, or control of OSHA. 
Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. Section 552 et seq ("FOIA"), I request copies of 
(or access to) documents about Jeffrey Epstein who died at the Metropolitan Correctional Center 
(MCC) on Aug. 10, 2019, specifically (hereafter described as "the records"): 
(1) The signed log in the Special Housing Unit at MCC that shows when prison staff did rounds on July 
and 23, and Aug. 9 and 10. 
(2) All quarter entries (showing which cells he was housed in) for Jeffrey Epstein at MCC. 
(3) The CIM Clearance and Separatee data sheet for Jeffrey Epstein at MCC. 
(4) The chronological disciplinary records for Jeffrey Epstein at MCC. 
(5) The intake screening form for Jeffrey Epstein at MCC. 
(6) The security designation records for Jeffrey Epstein at MCC. 
(7) The inmate profile for Jeffrey Epstein at MCC. 
(8) All incident reports related to Jeffrey Epstein at MCC. 
(9) All medical reports related to Jeffrey Epstein at MCC. 
(10) The signed visitor log for Jeffrey Epstein at MCC. 
(11) Documents showing when MCC staff held meetings regarding Jeffrey Epstein, and who attended. 
(12) All records generated from the meeting at MCC during which it was decided that Jeffrey Epstein 
would be taken off suicide watch. 
(13) The Post-Watch report compiled in order to take Jeffrey Epstein off suicide watch. 
(14) The overtime sign-up sheets for the Special Housing Unit (9 South) at MCC for Aug. 9 and 10, and 
on July 22 and 23. 
(15) Documents showing which staff were augmented at MCC and what positions they worked in on 
Aug. 9 and 10, and on July 22 and 23.

The Bureau of Prisons web-based inmate locator shows that only one Jeffrey Epstein is listed in the 
BOP system, so identifying the correct Jeffrey Epstein should not be a problem for the bureau. 
I am a reporter for The New York Times, an accredited and recognized newsgathering organization. I 
request the Records to inform the public about matters of public concem. 
ONGOING LAW ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS/INVESTIGATIONS 
As to any records located in the investigative files of pending investigations, you may not assert 
Exemption 7(A) without conducting a document-by-document review to determine whether release of 
the records would interfere with ongoing law enforcement proceedings. 
The United States District Court of the District of Columbia recently "remind[ed] the FBI of its obligation 
to conduct record-level reviews at the administrative level before refusing to produce records contained 
in its investigative files." Tipograph v. Dep't of Justice, 83 F. Supp. 2d 234 (D.D.C. Mar. 18, 2015) 
In addition, the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016 added a provision instructing federal agencies to 
withhold records only when their release would work some foreseeable or is prohibited by law, not just 
because they may technically be exempt. 
Even if the records might otherwise be exempt, an agency may withhold them only if their disclosure 
would actually harm the interest protected by the exemption, or if it is prohibited by some other law. 5 
U.S.0 552(a)(8). The agency does need to identify what reasonably foreseeable harm would flow from 
release of the information being withheld, consider partial disclosure of the information, take reasonable 
steps to segregate and release nonexempt information. 
RESPONSE TIME 
FOIA requires that your agency respond to this request within 20 business days. This request is 
segregable, and your agency may not withhold entire records because of one section that you believe 
is exempt from disclosure. Under federal law, if you choose to withhold any such parts of the records 
from disclosure, you must specify in a written response the factual and legal basis for withholding any 
part of the Records.

Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 24-1 Filed 08/05/20 Page 5 of 6 
ESTIMATED DATE OF COMPLETION 
I respectfully request that you provide me with a reasonably estimated date of completion. See 5 U.S.C. 
§ 552(a)(7)(B)(ii). If the estimated date of completion is being significantly delayed because of a portion 
of the request needs to be processed by another agency, please inform me which agency that is and 
whether it has provided you with an estimated date of completion. 
FORMAT OF REQUESTED RECORDS 
I am further requesting that the Records be provided to me on computer files in the same format as 
they are currently maintained at the agency, pursuant to Burka v. Dept. of Health & Human Svcs., 87 
F.3d 508 (D.C. Cir. 1996). As you know, providing documents electronically is cheaper than mailing 
hard copies. 
FEE WAIVER 
I respectfully request that you waive all fees in connection with this request as provided by 5 U.S.C. § 
552(a)(4)(A)(iii). FOIA was designed to provide citizens a broad right to access government records. 
FOIA's basic purpose is to "open agency action to the light of public scrutiny," with a focus on the 
public's "right to be informed about what their government is up to." U.S. Dep't of Justice v. Reporters 
Comm. For Freedom of Press, 489 U.S. 749, 773-74 (1989) (internal quotation and citations omitted). 
In order to provide public access to this information, FOIA's fee waiver provision requires "[d]ocuments 
shall be furnished without any charge or at a [reduced] charge . . . disclosure of the information is in the 
public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or 
activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester." 5 U.S.C. § 
552(a)(4)(A)(iii). 
EXPEDITED PROCESSING 
There is extreme public interest in records concerning the prison stay and death of Jeffrey Epstein, who 
was accused of sexually abusing scores of women and underage girls. Not only has a person died in 
federal custody, but the death has generated multiple conspiracy theories implicating government 
works at the highest levels and taxpayer money. Disclosure of the records request is in the public 
interest because disclosure is likely to contribute significantly to the understanding of the operations or 
activities of the government. In addition, as one of the largest circulation newspapers in the United 
States, The New York Times plays an important role in sharing information with the public and helping 
the public understand how the federal government works. Disclosure of the records is not primarily in 
the commercial interest of myself or The New York Times but is intended to facilitate reporting on the

Dear FOIA Officer: 
Requested records 
"Records" means information of any kind, including writings (handwritten, typed, electronic or otherwise

minutes of meetings, records of meetings in any form, and any other compilation of data from which 
information can be obtained. All of the foregoing are included in this request if they are in the 
possession of or otherwise under the New York Times requests for Records of the following type in the 
possession, custody, or control of OSHA. 
Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. Section 552 et seq ("FOIA"), I request copies of 
(or access to) documents about Jeffrey Epstein who died at the Metropolitan Correctional Center 
(MCC) on Aug. 10, 2019, specifically (hereafter described as "the records"): 
(1) All video camera footage at MCC pertinent to the Jeffrey Epstein suicide and the first suicide 
attempt. 
(2) All BOP documents pertaining to Jeffrey Epstein's suicide and first suicide attempt. 
(3) All BOP documents, including email correspondence and meeting minutes, pertaining to the 
decision to remove Jeffrey Epstein from suicide watch. 
(4) All BOP special investigation reports mentioning Jeffrey Epstein. 
(5) All BOP correspondence with the U.S. Attorney's Office regarding Jeffrey Epstein. 
The Bureau of Prisons web-based inmate locator shows that only one Jeffrey Epstein is listed in the 
BOP system, so identifying the correct Jeffrey Epstein should not be a problem for the bureau. For this 
request, records generated by BOP employees based in New York, Texas, and in Washington, DC, 
should be searched. 
I am a reporter for The New York Times, an accredited and recognized newsgathering organization. I 
request the Records to inform the public about matters of public concem.

would actually harm the interest protected by the exemption, or if it is prohibited by some other law. 5 
U.S.0 552(a)(8). The agency does need to identify what reasonably foreseeable harm would flow from 
release of the information being withheld, consider partial disclosure of the information, take reasonable 
steps to segregate and release nonexempt information. 
RESPONSE TIME 
FOIA requires that your agency respond to this request within 20 business days. This request is 
segregable, and your agency may not withhold entire records because of one section that you believe 
is exempt from disclosure. Under federal law, if you choose to withhold any such parts of the records 
from disclosure, you must specify in a written response the factual and legal basis for withholding any 
part of the Records. 
ESTIMATED DATE OF COMPLETION 
I respectfully request that you provide me with a reasonably estimated date of completion. See 5 U.S.C. 
§ 552(a)(7)(B)(ii). If the estimated date of completion is being significantly delayed because of a portion 
of the request needs to be processed by another agency, please inform me which agency that is and 
whether it has provided you with an estimated date of completion. 
FORMAT OF REQUESTED RECORDS 
I am further requesting that the Records be provided to me on computer files in the same format as 
they are currently maintained at the agency, pursuant to Burka v. Dept. of Health & Human Svcs., 87 
F.3d 508 (D.C. Cir. 1996). As you know, providing documents electronically is cheaper than mailing 
hard copies. 
FEE WAIVER 
I respectfully request that you waive all fees in connection with this request as provided by 5 U.S.C. § 
552(a)(4)(A)(iii). FOIA was designed to provide citizens a broad right to access government records. 
FOIA's basic purpose is to "open agency action to the light of public scrutiny," with a focus on the 
public's "right to be informed about what their government is up to." U.S. Dep't of Justice v. Reporters 
Comm. For Freedom of Press, 489 U.S. 749, 773-74 (1989) (internal quotation and citations omitted). 
In order to provide public access to this information, FOIA's fee waiver provision requires "[djocuments 
shall be furnished without any charge or at a [reduced] charge . . . disclosure of the information is in the 
public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or 
activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester." 5 U.S.C. §

EXPEDITED PROCESSING 
There is extreme public interest in records concerning the prison stay and death of Jeffrey Epstein, who 
was accused of sexually abusing scores of women and underage girls. Not only has a person died in 
federal custody, but the death has generated multiple conspiracy theories implicating government 
works at the highest levels and taxpayer money. Disclosure of the records request is in the public 
interest because disclosure is likely to contribute significantly to the understanding of the operations or 
activities of the government. In addition, as one of the largest circulation newspapers in the United 
States, The New York Times plays an important role in sharing information with the public and helping 
the public understand how the federal government works. Disclosure of the records is not primarily in 
the commercial interest of myself or The New York Times but is intended to facilitate reporting on the 
operations of government. 
Please contact me if I may assist in your office's response to this request.

Request Number: 2019-05665 
Dear Ms. Ivory: 
This is in response to the above referenced Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, 
which we received on August 13, 2019. Specifically, you request various documents 
regarding inmate Jeffrey Epstein. 
After a thorough review of your request, we have determined that any records 
responsive to your request are categorically exempt from disclosure. Accordingly, this 
Office is not required to conduct a search for the requested records. Pursuant to the 
Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552, records are withheld in full from disclosure 
to you under the following exemptions: 
(b)(5) - inter- or intra-agency correspondence which would not be available to a party 
other than a party in litigation with the agency 
(b)(6) - constitutes a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy 
(b)(7)(A) - could reasonably be expected to interfere with law enforcement proceedings 
(b)(7)(C) - constitutes an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy 
(b)(7)(E) - discloses investigative techniques and procedures 
(b)(7)(F) - could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any 
individual 
Please note, exemption (b)(7)(A) is a temporary exemption utilized to protect active and 
on-going law enforcement proceedings. Because of its temporary nature, you may wish 
to consider refiling your request for records in the future. Should you chose to refile your 
request, the status of law enforcement proceedings will be reevaluated and a 
determination made at that time as to the continued applicability of exemption (b)(7)(A). 
If you have questions about this response please feel free to contact me at 
kchristenson@bop.ciov or the Federal Bureau of Prisons' (BOP) FOIA Public Liaison,

Dear Alexandra Perloff-Giles: 
You appealed from the action of the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) on your Freedom 
of Information Act request for access to records concerning specific documents related to Jeffery 
Epstein and his death at Metropolitan Correctional Center on August 10, 2019. I note that your 
appeal concerns the withholdings made by BOP. 
After carefully considering your appeal, I am affirming, on partly modified grounds, 
BOP's action on your request. The FOIA provides for disclosure of many agency records. At 
the same time, Congress included in the FOIA nine exemptions from disclosure that provide 
protection for important interests such as personal privacy, privileged communications, and 
certain law enforcement activities. BOP properly withheld this information in full because it is 
protected from disclosure under the FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(A) and it is 
reasonably foreseeable that disclosure of this information would harm the interests protected by 
this provision. This provision concerns records or information compiled for law enforcement 
purposes the release of which could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement 
proceedings.' 
Please be advised that this Office's decision was made only after a full review of this 
matter. Your appeal was assigned to an attorney with this Office who thoroughly reviewed and 
analyzed your appeal, your underlying request, and the action of the BOP in response to your 
request. 
If you are dissatisfied with my action on your appeal, the FOIA permits you to file a 
lawsuit in federal district court in accordance with 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B). 
I Please be advised that since this Office determined that records responsive to your request were properly withheld 
in full under Exemption 7(A), this Office did not adjudicate the applicability other exemptions cited.

FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT REQUEST 
Dear FOIA Officer 
Requested records 
"Records" means information of any kind, including writings (handwritten. 
typed, electronic or otherwise produced. reproduced or stored), letters, 
memoranda. correspondence, notes, applications, completed forms, studies, 
reports, reviews, telephone conversations, faxes. emails, documents, 
photographs, minutes of meetings, records of meetings in any form, and any 
other compilation of data from which information can he obtained. All of 
the foregoing are included in this request if they are in the possession of 
or otherwise under the New York Times requests for Records of the following 
type in the possession, custody, or control of OSHA. 
Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. Section 552 et seq 
("FOIA"), I request copies of (or access to) documents about Jeffrey 
Epstein who died at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) on Aug. 10, 
2019, specifically (hereafter described as - the records"): 
(1) The full log of Mr. Epstein's phone calls to and from the MCC. 
(2) All email correspondence to and from Mr. Epstein while he was at the 
MCC (including any correspondence through the Corrlinks system or any other 
email system he had access to.) 
EFTA00015413
--- PAGE 54 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 24-5 Filed 08/05/20 Page 3 of 4 
(3) The full log of people who visited Mr. Epstein while he was at the MCC 
and when they visited. 
(4) The full list of people that Mr. Epstein had requested to be on his 
approved visitor list. 
(5) The full list of people that Mr. Epstein had requested to be on his 
approved email correspondence list. 
(6) The full list of people that Mr. Epstein had requested to be on his 
approved call list. 
The Bureau of Prisons web-based inmate locator shows that only one Jeffrey 
Epstein is listed in the BOP system, so identifying the correct Jeffrey 
Epstein should not be a problem for the bureau. For this request, records 
generated by BOP employees based in New York, Texas, and in Washington, DC, 
should be searched. 
lam a reporter for The Ncw York Times, an accredited and recognized 
newsgathering organization. I request the Records to inform the public 
about matters of public concern. 
ONGOING LAW ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGSlINVESTIGATIONS 
As to any records located in the investigative files of pending 
investigations, you may not assert Exemption 7(A) without conducting a 
document-by-document review to determine whether release of the records 
would interfere with ongoing law enforcement proceedings. 
The United States District Coun of the District of Columbia recently 
"remindled) the FBI of its obligation to conduct record-level reviews at 
the administrative level before refusing to produce records contained in 
its investigative elks." Tipograph v. Dept of Justice, 83 F. Supp. 2d 234 
(D.D.C. Mar. 18, 2015) 
In addition, the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016 added a provision instructing 
federal agencies to withhold records only when their release would work 
some foreseeable or is prohibited by law, not just because they may 
technically be exempt. 
Even if the records might otherwise be exempt, an agency may withhold them 
only if their disclosure would actually harm the interest protected by the 
exemption, or if it is prohibited by some other law. 5 U.S.0 552(a)(8). The 
agency does need to identify what reasonably foreseeable harm would flow 
from release of the infomiation being withheld, consider partial disclosure 
of the information, take reasonable steps to segregate and release 
nonexempt information. 
RESPONSE TIME 
FOIA requires that your agency respond to this request within 20 business 
days. This request is segregable, and your agency may not withhold entire 
records because of one section that you believe is exempt from disclosure. 
Under federal law, if you choose to withhold any such parts of the records 
from disclosure, you must specify in a written response the factual and 
legal basis for withholding any part of the Records. 
ESTIMATED DATE OF COMPLETION 
I respectfully request that you provide me with a reasonably estimated date 
of completion. Sec 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(7XBXii). If the estimated date of 
completion is being significantly delayed because of a portion of the 
request needs to be processed by another agency, please inform me which 
agency that is and whether it has provided you with an estimated date of 
completion.

files in the same format as they arc currently maintained at the agency.

Request Number: 2020-01336 
Dear Ms. Ivory: 
This is in response to the above referenced Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. 
On 01-02-2020, you submitted a FOIA request to the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP). 
A copy of your request is attached. 
After reviewing your request, the BOP determined the request should be aggregated 
into one request, which is request number 2020-01336. This request was made on 12-
12-2019, which is the date you submitted the earliest request being aggregated. This 
will ensure you are not disadvantaged by our action. 
Department of Justice regulations provide for the aggregation of requests where "a 
component reasonably believes that a requester...is attempting to divide a single 
request into a series of requests for the purpose of avoiding fees...." The regulation

Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 23 Filed 08/05/20 Page 1 of 10 
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
THE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY, 
Plaintiff, 
v. 
FEDERAL BUREAU OF PRISONS, 
Defendant. 
20-CV-00833 (PAE) 
HFCLARATION OF NICOLE MCFARLAND 
I, Nicole McFarland, declare as follows: 
I. I am employed by the United States Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons 
("BOP"), as a Staff Attorney at the Metropolitan Correctional Center ("MCC"). I have served 
in this role since December 2019. Prior to that time, I was the Senior Staff Attorney at MDC 
Brooklyn from January 2009 until December 2019 and the Staff attorney at FCI Fort Dix from 
September 2005 until January 2009. I have been employed by the BOP since September 
2005. 
2. As a Staff Attorney, my duties include coordinating searches at MCC when a Freedom of 
Information Act ("FOIA") requires MCC staff to undertake a search for responsive 
documents. In this capacity, I typically work with staff at GOP's Central Office. In this case, 
I communicated with BOP Government Information Specialist Kara Christenson regarding 
Plaintiff's FOIA requests. 
3. I submit this declaration in support of the GOP's motion for summary judgment and to 
EFTA00015428
--- PAGE 2 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 23 Filed 08/05/20 Page 2 of 10 
describe GOP's search at MCC for records responsive to the FOIA requests submitted by 
Plaintiff. 
4. The statements made in this declaration are based upon my personal knowledge, conversations 
and communications with other BOP staff, and information available to me in my official 
capacity and about which I have become knowledgeable. 
5. To conduct the search at MCC for records responsive to Plaintiff's FOIA request, I conferred 
with staff at MCC and staff at Central Office to determine that the following individuals 
would likely have documents responsive to Plaintiff's request: Lieutenant, MCC Associate 
Warden; MCC Chief Psychologist; Executive Assistant to the MCC Warden; Case 
Management Coordinator in the MCC Records Department; Special Investigave Agent at 
the MCC; Deputy Regional Counsel for the Northeast Regional Office and former BOP 
Staff Attorney at the MCC; former MCC Warden; and Unit Managers. Based on my 
conversations with staff at MCC and Central Office and my own experience, no other 
individuals at MCC, or who formerly worked at MCC, are reasonably likely to have records 
responsive to Plaintiff's request. 
6. I asked each of the individuals identified in Paragraph 5 to search their electronic and non-
electronic files for documents responsive to Plaintiff's FOIA requests. Each of them advised 
me that he or she conducted a manual search of electronic and non-electronic files for 
documents responsive to Plaintiff's FOIA requests. Their searches included a search of drives 
on GOP's computer system where individual BOP employees can save documents. Separate 
from these searches conducted by individuals, a search for email records and searches of other 
BOP electronic systems, including SENTRY and TRULINKS, for records responsive to 
EFTA00015429
--- PAGE 3 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 23 Filed 08/05/20 Page 3 of 10 
Plaintiff's FOIA requests was conducted by Central Office and is detailed in the Declaration 
of Kara Christenson (the "Christenson Declaration"). 
7. The results of the searches conducted by MCC in response to Plaintiffs' requests are described 
in the following paragraphs. 
8. SHU LOGS — With respect to Plaintiff's request for "[t]he signed log in the Special Housing 
Unit at MCC that shows when prison staff did rounds on July 22 and 23, and Aug. 9 and 1," 
MCC staff determined that the SHU log books in question were handed over to the Office of 
the Inspector General ("OIG") on or about August 22, 2019. With the exception of the 
scanned copies of certain log book pages described in the Christenson Declaration, the 
searches at MCC did not return additional records responsive to this request. 
9. SENTRY OUARTER'S HISTORY — With respect to Plaintiff's request for "[a]ll quarter 
entries (showing which cells he was housed in) for Jeffrey Epstein at MCC[,]" Central Office 
conducted a search of the SENTRY database, as described in the Christenson Declaration.

for "CIM Clearance and Separatee data sheet for Jeffrey Epstein at MCC[,]" Central Office

not return additional records responsive to this request. 
12. INTAKE SCREENING FORM - Based on my own experience and conversations with 
BOP staff at MCC and Central Office, the DROP File for Epstein was the only likely place 
where "the intake screening form for Jeffrey Epstein at MCC" would be located. To locate 
the DROP File for Epstein, I requested that the Case Management Coordinator for the MCC 
Records Department, obtain the file. The Case Management Coordinator obtained the file, which 
did not contain records responsive to Plaintiff's request for intake screening forms. Based on 
my own experience and conversations with MCC and Central Office staff, there are no other 
locations likely to produce records responsive to this request.

other responsive log books were handed over to OIG on or about August 22, 2019. With the 
exception of the scanned copies of certain log book pages described in the Christenson 
Declaration, the searches at MCC did not return additional records responsive to this request.

when MCC staff held meetings regarding Jeffrey Epstein, and who attended[,]" Central Office 
conducted a search for responsive emails and meeting invites within the GROUPWISE 
system, as described in the Christenson Declaration. In addition, MCC staff searched for

individuals identified in Paragraph 5 who searched for responsive records include all MCC 
staff likely to have attended any meetings regarding the removal of Epstein from suicide 
watch and therefore the only MCC staff reasonably likely to have responsive records. The 
searches at MCC did not locate documents responsive to Plaintiff's request relating to any

--- PAGE 7 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 23 Filed 08/05/20 Page 7 of 10 
of Investigation on or about August 10, 2019. Nonetheless, MCC searched the Special

24. ST IICIDE ATTEMPT AND SUICIDE RECORDS — With respect to plaintiff's request for

reasonably likely have records responsive to plaintiff's request, including meeting minutes or 
email correspondence. In particular, the individuals identified in Paragraph 5 who searched 
for responsive records include all MCC staff likely to have attended any meetings regarding 
the removal of Epstein from suicide watch. The searches at MCC located responsive records, 
including saved email correspondence but no meeting minutes. The results of the MCC staff's 
search largely overlapped with the results of Central Office's search of the GROUPWISE and 
BEMR systems, but also located the Form 583 for Epstein's apparent suicide attempt, and 
memoranda and reports of Epstein's apparent suicide attempt. After these searches were 
EFTA00015434
--- PAGE 8 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 23 Filed 08/05/20 Page 8 of 10 
conducted, I double-checked with the Executive Assistant to the MCC Warden and the 
MCC's chief psychologist and confirmed that they did not have any meeting minutes or any 
record of a meeting held to determine that Epstein would be removed from suicide watch. The 
Executive Assistant to the MCC Wanlen and MCC's chief psychologist are the only individuals 
likely to have attended or to have been aware of such a meeting, and thus the only MCC 
staff reasonably likely to have responsive records. 
26. SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE REPORTS — With respect to Plaintiff's request for "[s]ll 
BOP special investigation reports mentioning Jeffrey Epstein[,]" Central Office conducted a 
search of the BOP Special Investigative Section, as described in the Christenson Declaration.

systems and located by MCC staff. Other than these memoranda, no systematic record or log 
was located of Epstein's calls while he was incarcerated. 
29. EMAIL COMMUNICATIONS — With respect to Plaintiff's request for "[a]ll email 
correspondence to and from Mr. Epstein while he was at the MCC (including any

teams at the USAO-SDNY, public court filings, and conclusions made in accordance therewith. 
3. 
I submit this declaration in support of BOP's motion for summary judgment in 
this case. 
The Prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein 
4. 
On July 2, 2019, Jeffrey Epstein was charged with one count of conspiracy to 
commit sex trafficking, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371, and one count of sex trafficking, in 
violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591(a), (b)(2), and 2. On July 6, 2019, Epstein was arrested and 
thereafter incarcerated at the MCC until his death. 
5. 
On July 10, 2019, Epstein was assigned to the Special Housing Unit ("SHU") at 
the MCC due to, among other things, a risk of suicidality and safety concerns relating to housing 
him with the MCC's general population. On July 18, 2019, a bond hearing as to Epstein was 
held before the Honorable Richard M. Berman, after which the Court granted the government's 
motion for remand and denied Epstein's motion for pretrial release. See Noel Indictment 1 10. 
6. 
On July 23, 2019, MCC officers responded to an emergency call and found 
Epstein on the floor of his cell with a strip of bedsheet around his neck. See Noel Indictment 
11. Michael Thomas, a correctional officer at the MCC and one of the defendants in the Noel 
case, was one of the MCC officials who responded to this incident. See id. Epstein was 
subsequently transferred out of the SHU, placed on suicide watch for 24 hours, and then 
EFTA00015439
--- PAGE 3 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 22 Filed 08/05/20 Page 3 of 13 
transferred to psychological observation, a different status in a different location within MCC's 
hospital ward, until July 30, 2019. On July 30, 2019, Epstein was transferred back to the SHU. 
See /dill 11-13. 
7. 
On August 10, 2019, Epstein was found in his cell, not responsive and with a 
noose around his neck. See id.1 26. He was transferred to a local hospital where he was 
declared dead shortly thereafter. See id. 1 27. The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of the 
City of New York conducted an autopsy and determined that Epstein had committed suicide by 
hanging himself. See id. 
8. 
On August 29, 2019, following a public hearing on August 27, 2019, Judge 
Berman entered an order of nolle prosequi against Epstein. See Nolle Prosequi, Dkt. No. 52, 
United States v. Epstein, No. 19 Cr. 490 (RMB) (S.D.N.Y.). 
The Prosecution of Tova Noel and Michael Thomas 
9. 
As alleged in the Noel Indictment, Thomas and Tova Noel were correctional 
officers on duty at the SHU on August 9-10, 2019, the night of Epstein's death. See Noel 
Indictment 11 3-4. On that night, Noel and Thomas repeatedly failed to perform mandated 
counts of prisoners under their watch, including Epstein. To conceal this failure, they repeatedly 
signed false certifications attesting to having conducted multiple counts of inmates, when, in 
truth, they had not conducted such counts. See id. 11 15-24. On November 19, 2019, Noel and 
Thomas were charged in the Noel Indictment with one count of conspiring to defraud the United 
States and to make or use a false writing or document, in violation of Title 18, United States 
Code, Section 371; and five counts as to Noel and three counts as to Thomas of making or using 
a false writing or document, in violation of Tide 18, United States Code, Sections 1001(a)(3) and 
(2). Noel Indictment ¶9[ 28-40. The Noel case is pending before the Honorable Analisa Torres. 
Trial has been scheduled to begin on January 4, 2021.

The Prosecution and Incarceration of Nicholas Tartaglione 
10. 
In a superseding indictment filed on April 16, 2019, Nicholas Tartaglione was 
charged with one count of conspiracy to distribute narcotics, in violation of Title 21, United 
States Code, Section 846; four counts of intentional killing in furtherance of a drug trafficking 
crime, in violation of Title 21, United States Code, Section 848(e)(1)(A) and Title 18, United 
States Code, Section 2; three counts of murder through the use of a firearm in furtherance of a 
drug trafficking crime, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 924(j) and 2; one 
count of conspiracy to commit kidnapping, in violation of Title 18, United State Code, Section 
1201; four counts of kidnapping resulting in death, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, 
Sections 1201(a)(1) and 2; and four counts of using a facility of interstate commerce to commit a 
crime of violence in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1952 and 2. These 
charges arise from the April 2016 murders of Martin Luna, Miguel Luna, Urbano Santiago, and 
Hector Gutierrez. On April 19, 2019, USAO-SDNY filed a Notice of Intent to Seek the Death 
Penalty against Tartaglione. The Tartaglione case is pending before the Honorable Kenneth M. 
Karns. No trial date has been set. 
II. 
Tartaglione has been detained since he was arrested on December 19, 2016. For 
certain periods of his detention, including in July 2019, Tartaglione was housed at the MCC. In 
early July 2019, Tartaglione was transferred to the MCC's SHU. For a time, including on July 
23, 2019, Tartaglione was housed in the same SHU cell as Jeffrey Epstein. 
Records Withheld from Disclosure Pursuant to FOIA Exemption 7(A) on 
Account of Likely Interference with Noel 
12. 
U.S.C. § 522 (b)(7)(A) ("Exemption 7(A)") exempts from disclosure "records 
or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production 
EFTA00015441
--- PAGE 5 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 22 Filed 08/05/20 Page 5 of 13 
of such law enforcement records or information ... could reasonably be expected to interfere 
with enforcement proceedings ...." 
13. 
I and the prosecutors responsible for the Noel prosecution have reviewed each of 
the records responsive to the FOIA requests withheld in full or in part under Exemption 7(A), 
including those reflected on the index prepared by BOP and attached to the declaration of Kara 
Christenson (the "BOP index"). All of these records fall within the scope of Exemption 7(A). 
14. 
Public disclosure of the records withheld under Exemption 7(A) could reasonably 
be expected to interfere with the pending prosecutions of Noel and Thomas. These records 
include information about which numerous witnesses are expected to testify at trial, include 
details that are not publicly known or known to other witnesses, and include information and 
documents authored by potential trial witnesses. These records also include potential trial 
exhibits, which some or all potential trial witnesses have not seen, and premature disclosure of 
those materials could influence witness testimony at trial, or enable witnesses to change or shape 
their testimony. Premature disclosure of these records and/or the information contained therein 
could reasonably be expected to influence witnesses' potential testimony at trial and/or allow 
witnesses to alter their testimony to conform to other evidence. 
15. 
Further, premature public disclosure of the records withheld under Exemption 
7(A) could reasonably be expected to impair the government's (and the defendants') ability to 
seat a fair and impartial jury in Noel. The government anticipates that some of the records 
withheld under Exemption 7(A) will be entered into evidence as exhibits at trial, and other 
records that may not be trial exhibits bear on the contents of potential trial exhibits. Premature 
disclosure of these records, or the information contained therein, could influence potential jurors' 
understanding of the evidence at trial and the case overall. Similarly, premature disclosure of the 
records could prejudice potential jurors for or against the defendants in the Noel action, which 
EFTA00015442
--- PAGE 6 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 22 Filed 08/05/20 Page 6 of 13 
would also impair the government's (and the defendants') ability to seat a fair and impartial jury. 
In addition, as noted above, these records include specific information about which witnesses are 
expected to testify at trial, as well as information and documents authored by potential trial 
witnesses, such that premature public disclosure could reasonably be expected to influence 
potential jurors' perception of the witnesses and the evidence to be presented at trial. 
16. 
The risks of interference with the Noel proceedings are heightened by the media 
coverage of speculation and theories about Epstein's death. Many publicly-discussed theories of 
Epstein's death are unfounded. Premature release of the withheld records, particularly if the 
records are released in part or without full context, may influence the perception of jurors who 
have been exposed to such media coverage of speculation and theories. 
Non-Email Records Withheld Pursuant to Exemption 7(A) on 
Account of Likely Interference with Noel 
17. 
The considerations discussed above apply to each of the categories of responsive 
non-email records withheld in full or in part by BOP under Exemption 7(A). 
18. 
First, the government anticipates that MCC staffing records, including overtime 
logs and daily assignment rosters for the MCC on July 22, July 23 August 9, and 10, 2019 and 
some of the dates in between, will be the subject of witness testimony at the Noel trial. In 
addition, the government anticipates that some of these documents will be trial exhibits. 
Releasing these materials prematurely could reasonably be expected to influence witnesses' 
potential testimony at trial, allow witnesses to alter their testimony to conform to other evidence, 
or influence potential jurors' perceptions of witness testimony or evidence. 
19. 
Second, the government anticipates that reports and memoranda prepared by 
BOP, such as the reports, memoranda, photographs, and evidence of Epstein's July 23, 2019 
apparent suicide attempt; reports, memoranda, and letters concerning Epstein's August 10, 2019 
EFTA00015443
--- PAGE 7 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 22 Filed 08/05/20 Page 7 of 13 
suicide and surrounding events; documents in BOP's possession from the New York City Office 
of Chief Medical Examiner; and reports and letters concerning MCC's and BOP's response to 
Epstein's death, may be trial exhibits, the subject of witness testimony, or were prepared by 
witnesses who will testify at trial. Premature disclosure of these materials could reasonably be 
expected to influence witnesses' potential testimony at trial, allow witnesses to alter their 
testimony to conform to other evidence, or influence potential jurors' perceptions of witness 
testimony or evidence. Alternatively, if evidence of Epstein's July 23, 2019 suicide attempt or 
August 10, 2019 suicide and surrounding events is excluded from evidence at trial, pre-trial 
publication of these materials would risk exposing potential jurors for or against the defendants 
in the Noel action on the basis of material they would otherwise not be shown during trial, which 
would impair the government's (and the defendants') ability to seat a fair and impartial jury. 
20. 
Third, the government anticipates that certain medical and psychological records 
of Epstein prepared by BOP may be trial exhibits, the subject of witness testimony, and/or were 
prepared by witnesses who will testify at trial. Premature disclosure of these records could 
influence the testimony of potential witnesses, including by potentially causing them to alter or 
confirm their testimony. In addition, premature disclosure of these records could reasonably be 
expected to prejudice potential jurors for or against the defendants in the Noel action, which 
would impair the government's (and the defendants') ability to seat a fair and impartial jury. 
21. 
Fourth, the government anticipates that documents related to counts of inmates, 
including logs, count slips, and rosters, and other entries in BOP logs for August 9 and 10 may 
be trial exhibits, the subject of witness testimony, and/or were prepared by witnesses who will 
testify at trial. Premature disclosure of these materials could reasonably be expected to influence 
witnesses' potential testimony at trial, allow witnesses to alter their testimony to conform to 
other evidence, and/or influence potential jurors' perceptions of witness testimony or evidence. 
EFTA00015444
--- PAGE 8 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 22 Filed 08/05/20 Page 8 of 13 
22. 
Fifth, the government anticipates that an August 8, 2019, review of inmates in the 
SHU prepared by BOP may be a trial exhibit, the subject of witness testimony, and/or was 
prepared by witnesses who will testify at trial. Premature disclosure of this record could 
reasonably be expected to influence witnesses' potential testimony at trial and/or allow witnesses 
to alter their testimony to conform to other evidence. 
Email Records Withheld Pursuant to Exemption 7(A) on 
Account of Likely Interference with Noel 
23. 
The considerations discussed above also apply to each of the categories of 
responsive email documents withheld in full or in part by BOP under Exemption 7(A). 
24. 
First, emails pertaining to Epstein's July 23, 2019 apparent suicide attempt, his 
incarceration prior to his suicide, and his mental health, including emails written by BOP's 
Psychology Services, discuss topics and information that the government anticipates may be the 
subject of witness testimony at the Noel trial. Their disclosure could influence witness 
testimony, including by allowing witnesses to alter their testimony to conform to other evidence, 
or influence potential jurors' perceptions of witness testimony or evidence. Alternatively, as 
described above, if evidence of Epstein's July 23, 2019 suicide attempt or is excluded from 
evidence at trial, pre-trial publication of these materials would risk exposing potential jurors for 
or against the defendants in the Noel action on the basis of material they would otherwise not be 
shown during trial, which would impair the government's (and the defendants') ability to seat a 
fair and impartial jury. 
25. 
Second, emails relating to Epstein's death, investigations into Epstein's death, the 
circumstances of his suicide, and the BOP's response to Epstein's death discuss topics and 
information that the government anticipates will be relevant to and/or the subject of witness 
testimony at the Noel trial. Their disclosure could influence witness testimony, including by 
EFTA00015445
--- PAGE 9 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 22 Filed 08/05/20 Page 9 of 13 
allowing witnesses to alter their testimony to conform to other evidence, or influence potential 
jurors' perceptions of witness testimony or evidence. Alternatively, as described above, if 
evidence of Epstein's suicide is excluded from evidence at trial, pre-trial publication of these 
materials would risk exposing potential jurors for or against the defendants in the Noel action on 
the basis of material they would otherwise not be shown during trial, which would impair the 
government's (and the defendants') ability to seat a fair and impartial jury. 
26. 
Providing more detailed public descriptions of the withheld documents and how 
their release would interfere with the Noel prosecution would itself risk interfering with the Noel 
prosecution. For example, public disclosure of more detailed descriptions of the documents 
anticipated to be proffered as exhibits at trial, or that bear on other trial exhibits, would disclose 
elements of the Government's trial strategy in Noel, including its selection of trial exhibits and 
the anticipated content of witness testimony. More detailed public descriptions could also 
prematurely disclose how the prosecution team expects the trial to proceed. 
Records Withheld Pursuant to Exemption 7(A) on 
Account of Likely Interference With Tartaglione 
27. 
In the course of reviewing the responsive records that BOP has withheld pursuant 
to Exemption 7(A), prosecutors in the Criminal Division of the USAO-SDNY determined that 
certain of the records refer to or discuss Tartaglione (the "Tartaglione Records"). Upon 
determining that some of the records withheld by BOP refer to or discuss Tartaglione, USAO-
SDNY reviewed these records to determine whether their release would interfere with the 
pending criminal action against Tartaglione. USAO-SDNY has concluded that release of certain 
of the withheld records could reasonably be expected to interfere with the prosecution of 
Tartaglione. This constitutes a basis to withhold these records under Exemption 7(A), 
independent from the likely interference with the Noel prosecution discussed above. 
EFTA00015446
--- PAGE 10 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 22 Filed 08/05/20 Page 10 of 13 
28. 
The Tartaglione Records fall within several categories of responsive documents 
withheld by BOP and include reports and evidence of Epstein's July 23, 2019 apparent suicide 
attempt; reports and evidence of Epstein's death on August 10, 2019; email correspondence 
between Tartaglione's attorneys and legal counsel at the MCC; and medical and psychological 
records of Epstein prepared by BOP. The Tartaglione Records also include emails pertaining to 
Epstein's July 23, 2019 apparent suicide attempt, Epstein's mental and physical health, and 
Epstein's incarceration prior to his suicide. 
29. 
The Tartaglione Records fall within the scope of 7(A) because their disclosure 
could reasonably be expected to interfere with the prosecution of Tartaglione. The Tartaglione 
Records contain, among other things, information about Tartaglione's incarceration, including 
the period of time during which Tartaglione was Epstein's cellmate at the MCC, which includes 
the date of Epstein's apparent suicide attempt on July 23, 2019. The conditions of Tartaglione's 
confinement at the MCC, as well as his interactions with Epstein in July 2019, have been put 
directly at issue by Tartaglione's defense counsel, specifically in connection with the potential 
penalty phase of the case against Tartaglione. See Letter dated January 13, 2010, Dkt. No. 186, 
United States v. Tartaglione, No. 16 Cr. 832 (ICMK); Letter dated January 21, 2020, Dkt. No. 
193, United States v. Tartaglione, No. 16 Cr. 832 (KMK). In light of defense counsel's position, 
information contained in the Tartaglione Records may be relevant evidence in any possible 
penalty phase of the case against Tartaglione, and as a result, premature public disclosure of the 
Tartaglione Records could reasonably be expected to influence witness testimony and/or 
potential jurors' perceptions of witness testimony or evidence. 
30. 
Moreover, the nature of the charges against Epstein and the circumstances of his 
apparent suicide attempt and death create a risk that premature public disclosure of the 
Tartaglione Records could reasonably be expected to impair the government's (and the 
EFTA00015447
--- PAGE 11 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 22 Filed 08/05/20 Page 11 of 13 
defendants') ability to seat a fair and impartial jury in Tartaglione, particularly for purposes of a 
potential penalty-phase hearing required by 18 U.S.C. § 3593, by influencing potential juror 
perceptions of any interactions between Epstein and Tartaglione. 
31. 
The risks of interference with the Tartaglione proceedings are heightened by the 
media coverage of speculation and theories about Epstein's death. As noted previously, many 
publicly-discussed theories of Epstein's death are unfounded. The public dissemination of these 
theories increases the risk that premature release of the Tartaglione Records could influence 
witness testimony or jurors' perceptions, if records are released in part or without full context. 
32. 
The Tartaglione Records include several categories of records withheld by BOP. 
Specifically, the government anticipates that premature disclosure of the reports and evidence of 
Epstein's July 23, 2019 apparent suicide attempt; an inmate investigative report prepared prior to 
Epstein's death; reports and evidence of Epstein's death on August 10, 2019; email 
correspondence between Tartaglione's attorneys and legal counsel at the MCC; the August 8, 
2019 review of inmates in the SHU at MCC; and the medical and psychological records of 
Epstein prepared by BOP, including documents pertaining to his mental health, could reasonably 
be expected to adversely affect the Tartaglione proceedings and influence potential jurors' 
perceptions of Tartaglione, thereby impairing the district court's ability to seat a fair and 
impartial jury. In addition, emails pertaining to Epstein's July 23, 2019 apparent suicide attempt, 
Epstein's mental health, and Epstein's incarceration prior to his suicide, including emails that 
involve members of the defense or prosecution teams in Tartaglione, discuss topics and 
information that could adversely affect the Tartaglione proceedings and influence potential 
juror's perceptions of Tartaglione. These records likewise could reasonably be expected to 
impair the district court's ability to seat a fair and impartial jury.

Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 22 Filed 08/05/20 Page 12 of 13 
33. 
Providing more detailed public descriptions of the withheld documents and how 
their release would affect the Tartaglione prosecution would itself risk interfering with the 
Tartaglione prosecution. For example, public disclosure of more detailed descriptions would 
potentially implicate and publicize associations, interactions, or perceptions of associations or 
interactions between Tartaglione and Epstein, thereby risking influencing potential jurors in 
proceedings against Tartaglione, including for any sentencing hearing required by 18 U.S.C. 
§ 3593. 
Segregability 
34. 
The records withheld in full under Exemption 7(A) are exempt from disclosure in 
their entirety under Exemption 7(A). To the extent the records contain any non-exempt 
information, such information is inextricably intertwined with information that could reasonably 
be expected to interfere with the Noel and/or Tartaglione prosecutions for the reasons discussed 
above. The media coverage of speculation and theories about Epstein's death makes the 
segregation of any possibly non-exempt information particularly difficult because providing 
information pertaining to Epstein (or Tartaglione and Epstein) without complete context can 
reasonably be expected to contribute to the dissemination of speculation and theories about his 
death. This, in turn, could reasonably be expected to interfere with the district court's ability to 
seat a fair and impartial jury in proceedings against Noel, Thomas, and/or Tartaglione, including 
for any sentencing hearing required by 18 U.S.C. § 3593, for the reasons discussed above.

INDICTMENT 
16-(IUM 830 
INTRODUCTION 
1. 
On or about August 10, 2019, TOVA NOEL and MICHAEL 
THOMAS, the defendants, in dereliction of their duties as 
correctional officers at the Metropolitan Correctional Center 
("MCC"), repeatedly failed to perform mandated counts of prisoners 
under their watch in the MCC's Special Housing Unit ("SHU"). 
Instead, for substantial portions of their shifts, NOEL and THOMAS 
sat at their desk, browsed the Internet, and moved around the 
common area of the SHU. To conceal their failure to perform their 
duties, NOEL and THOMAS repeatedly signed false certifications 
attesting to having conducted multiple counts of inmates when, in 
truth and in fact, they never conducted such counts. As a result 
of those false statements, the MCC believed prisoners in the SHU 
were being regularly monitored and accounted for when, in fact, as 
a result of the defendants' conduct, no correctional officer 
conducted any count or round of the SHU from approximately 10:30

p.m. on August 9 until approximately 6:30 a.m. on August 10, at 
which time, as alleged herein, NOEL and THOMAS discovered the body 
of an MCC inmate, Jeffrey Epstein, who had committed suicide 
overnight while unobserved. 
RELEVANT INDIVIDUALS AND ENTITIES 
2. 
The MCC is a federal administrative detention 
facility located in Manhattan that is run by the Federal Bureau of 
Prisons ("BOP"). 
The MCC is one of several facilities used to 
house inmates who have been charged with federal crimes in the 
Southern District of New York and are awaiting trial. 
The MCC 
employs correctional officers, whose primary duty is to ensure the 
care, custody, and control of the inmate population of the MCC. 
3. 
TOVA NOEL, the defendant, has been employed as a 
correctional officer at the MCC since approximately 2016. As of 
August 2019, NOEL's primary assignment was the SHU. On August 9, 
2019, NOEL worked a regular shift from 4 p.m. to 12 a.m. in the 
SHU, and then worked an overtime shift from 12 a.m. to 8 a.m. on 
August 10, 2019, also in the SHU. NOEL had also worked a regular 
shift in the SHU the day before, August 8, 2019, from 12 p.m. to 
p.m. 
4. 
MICHAEL THOMAS, the defendant, has been employed as 
a correctional officer at the MCC since approximately 2007. 
Beginning in approximately 2013, THOMAS was assigned to work as a 
EFTA00015453

materials handler supervisor, although THOMAS regularly worked 
overtime shifts as a correctional officer, including in the SHU. 
THOMAS worked an overtime shift in the SHU on August 10, 2019, 
from 12 a.m. to 8 a.m. THOMAS did not work his regular shift on 
August 8 or August 9, 2019, but did work an overtime shift in the 
SHU on August 9, 2019 from 12 a.m. to 8 a.m. 
5. As 
detailed 
herein, 
Jeffrey 
Epstein 
was 
incarcerated at the MCC between his arrest on July 6, 2019, and 
his suicide on August 10, 2019. 
Epstein was detained pending 
trial in the Southern District of New York on sex trafficking 
charges. 
THE MCC AND INSTITUTIONAL COUNTS 
6. The MCC, which houses approximately 750 inmates at 
any given time, assigns inmates to various housing units within 
the MCC. The SHU is a housing unit within the MCC where inmates 
are securely separated from the general inmate population to ensure 
their own safety as well as the safety of staff and other inmates. 
The SHU is located on the ninth floor of the MCC, and access to 
that floor is controlled by a locked door that can be opened 
remotely only by an officer in the MCC's centralized control center 
(the "Control Center"), which is located on the first floor of the 
MCC. Access into the SHU is also controlled by a second locked 
door to which only correctional officers assigned to the SHU have

Caeage2DIS-O1:69930933- famaurremtZe-FilaldclagLIS2CPagarii 2,021 
keys while on duty. Within the SHU, inmates are assigned to six 
separate tiers, each of which can be accessed only via a single 
locked door to which the correctional officers assigned to the SHU 
have keys while on duty. Each tier has eight cells, each of which 
can house either one or two prisoners, and each individual cell - 
which is made of cement and metal - is accessed only through a 
single locked door, to which only correctional officers assigned 
to the SHU have keys while on duty. 
7. 
The BOP requires correctional officers assigned to 
guard inmates at the MCC to conduct institution-wide counts of 
inmates at regular, scheduled intervals to ensure that each inmate 
is alive and accounted for within the MCC (the "institutional 
count"). On weekdays, the MCC conducts five institutional counts 
at 4 p.m., 10 p.m., 12 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. Performing an 
institutional count is one of the most basic and essential aspects 
of a correctional officer's job, and the count is one of the most 
basic and essential functions of daily operation of the MCC. Two 
officers are required to perform the institutional count for each 
housing unit, including the SHU, and are further required to 
document their performance of the count on an official MCC form 
called a count slip. 
To perform the institutional count in the 
SHU, two officers must walk from tier to tier to observe and count 
each individual inmate. 
EFTA00015455
--- PAGE 19 ---
Cae.age2DI9-698C38304(E IlDoonurreentZe-FilklalagO5120)a@aeci3 b021 
8. On the count slip, both correctional officers are 
required to fill in the date and time the count was performed, 
write the total number of inmates physically present in the unit 
counted, and then sign the count slip. 
Once the correctional 
officers have completed and signed the count slips, the count slips 
are then collected and delivered to the Control Center, where 
officers within the Control Center are responsible for comparing 
the count slips from each housing unit to the institution's inmate 
roster to ensure that each inmate is accounted for. Only after 
all the count slips are collected from each housing unit, and the 
numbers on the slips are matched to the institution's inmate 
roster, can the institutional count be deemed "cleared" or 
completed. 
If a housing unit's count slip is incorrect or 
incomplete, then the institution cannot "clear" the count. 
Instead, the count must be completely redone in that housing unit 
via a more-intensive version of the institutional count called a 
"bed book count," in which officers must compare every individual 
inmate to the institution's inmate roster. 
Records of each 
institutional count, including the count slips, are provided to a 
supervising official and retained by the MCC. 
9. 
In addition to the institutional count, the BOP 
requires correctional officers assigned to the SHU to walk each of 
the tiers of the SHU - which is called a "round" - every thirty 
EFTA00015456
--- PAGE 20 ---
Cagage21:1419-6933830,413- IIDmoturremt2I2-FilalEklIMS2Pagefeol 2,021 
minutes ("30-minute rounds"). 
Like the institutional counts, 
correctional officers conduct 30-minute rounds to ensure that each 
inmate is alive and accounted for within his cell. Correctional 
officers working in the SHU are required to complete a form, which 
is reviewed and signed by their supervisor, documenting the date 
and time of each 30-minute round in each tier of the SHU. 
EPSTEIN'S PRIOR APPARENT SUICIDE ATTEMPT 
10. On July 6, 2019, inmate Jeffrey Epstein was 
arrested and detained at the MCC on sex trafficking charges. On 
July 10, 2019, Epstein was assigned to the SHU due to, among other 
things, risk factors for suicidality and safety concerns relating 
to housing him with the MCC's general population. 
11. On July 23, 2019, while Epstein was housed in the 
SHU, MCC officers responded to an emergency call, and found Epstein 
on the floor of his cell with a strip of bedsheet around his neck. 
MICHAEL THOMAS, the defendant, was one of the MCC officers who 
responded to the incident. Epstein was subsequently transferred 
out of the SHU and was placed on suicide watch. 
Inmates placed 
on suicide watch are housed in a cell on the hospital wing floor 
of the MCC, and are watched twenty-four hours a day by a staff 
member or a specially trained inmate companion. 
12. Epstein remained on suicide watch for approximately 
twenty-four hours, and then was transferred to psychological

Cagage2D-3:9-6O3O8213Ala 0Dmaiurremt2I2-FilalarlaalS2Page
cEl 2,021 
observation, until July 30, 2019. 
Psychological observation is 
less restrictive than suicide watch, but inmates are still housed 
in the hospital wing of the MCC and watched twenty-four hours a 
day. 
13. On July 30, 2019, Epstein was transferred back to 
the SHU, and, at the direction of the MCC's psychological staff, 
was required to have an assigned cellmate. 
Epstein was also 
assigned to the cell closest to the correctional officers' desk in 
the common area of the SHU, which was approximately fifteen feet 
from the cell. Conducting the required institutional counts and 
thirty-minute rounds in the SHU were also part of the MCC's 
procedures for ensuring the safety of inmates, including Epstein. 
EVENTS OF AUGUST 9-10, 2019 
14. On 
August 
9, 
2019, 
Epstein's 
cellmate 
was 
transferred out of the MCC in a routine, pre-arranged transfer at 
approximately 8 a.m. 
Despite the MCC's psychological staff's 
direction that Epstein have a cellmate, no new cellmat6 was 
assigned to Epstein's cell. 
15. TOVA NOEL, the defendant, was one of the assigned 
officers on duty in the SHU from 4 p.m. on August 9, 2019 to 8 
a.m. on August 10. 
From 4 p.m. to 12 a.m., two other officers 
were on duty with NOEL in the SHU: one officer was assigned to 
work from 2 p.m. to 10 p.m. ("Officer-1"), and one officer was 
EFTA00015458
--- PAGE 22 ---
Caeage2D1S-(093C3830 
IlDoonurrentZ12-FilEalalagi151200agagc9 3021 
assigned to work from 4 p.m. to 12 a.m. ("Officer-2"). MICHAEL 
THOMAS, the defendant, started his shift in the SHU at 12 a.m. on 
August 10. From 12 a.m. until 8 a.m. on August 10, NOEL and THOMAS 
were the only two officers on duty in the SHU. 
16. During the time period from 4 p.m. on August 9 to 
a.m. on August 10, the officers on duty in the SHU, including 
TOVA NOEL and MICHAEL THOMAS, the defendants, were responsible for 
conducting five institutional counts: 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. on August 
9; and 12 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. on August 10. NOEL, THOMAS and 
the other officers on duty were also responsible for completing 
paperwork attesting to each of those counts. While, as detailed 
herein, count slips were completed for each institutional count, 
in fact, not a single one of those institutional counts was done. 
17. TOVA NOEL, the defendant, and Officer-1 were 
responsible for conducting the 4 p.m. institutional count in the 
SHU. As video from the MCC's internal video surveillance system 
makes clear, NOEL and Officer-1 did not perform the 4 p.m. count. 
Nonetheless, NOEL and Officer-1 completed and signed a count slip 
that falsely stated that the 4 p.m. institutional count had been 
performed. 
In reliance on that falsified count slip, at 
approximately 5:03 p.m., the Control Center cleared the 4 p.m. 
count. 
EFTA00015459
--- PAGE 23 ---
CaQataClia9410&agB3-30kET COoinneen22-1FikitbdilOSE01420Pafige AO2fl 21 
18. That evening, Epstein returned to the SHU from his 
attorney visit and was escorted into his cell by TOVA NOEL, the 
defendant, and another officer at approximately 7:49 p.m. 
NOEL 
and the other officer left the tier in which Epstein was housed 
immediately thereafter. 
19. By or before 10 p.m., all inmates in the MCC were 
locked in their cells for the night. At or around that time, TOVA 
NOEL, the defendant, and Officer-2 were responsible for conducting 
the 10 p.m. institutional count in the SHU. However, video from 
the MCC's internal video surveillance system shows that NOEL and 
Officer-2 did not perform the 10 p.m. count. 
Nonetheless, NOEL 
and Officer-2 completed and signed a count slip falsely stating 
that the 10 p.m. institutional count had been performed. 
In 
reliance on that falsified count slip, at approximately 10:36 p.m., 
the Control Center cleared the 10 p.m. count. 
20. As reflected on video obtained from the MCC's 
internal video surveillance system, at approximately 10:30 p.m. on 
August 9, 2019 - after TOVA NOEL, the defendant, had signed and 
submitted the 10 p.m. count slip and the institutional count had 
been completed - NOEL briefly walked up to, and then walked back 
from, the door to the tier in which Epstein was housed. 
As 
confirmed by the video obtained from the MCC's internal video 
surveillance system, this was the last time anyone, including any 
EFTA00015460
--- PAGE 24 ---
Caetaae201-00303319443 flayawnenit22-E ilaleicill8KB720Pagale 318021 
correctional officer, walked up to, let alone entered, the only 
entrance to the tier in which Epstein was housed until 
approximately 6:30 a.m. on August 10. 
21. Officer-l's shift ended at approximately 10 p.m., 
and at approximately 12 a.m., MICHAEL THOMAS, the defendant, 
replaced Officer-2, joining TOVA NOEL, the defendant, as the only 
two correctional officers on duty in the SHU. 
NOEL and THOMAS 
were responsible for conducting the 12 a.m. institutional count in 
the SHU. 
As confirmed by video from the MCC's internal video 
surveillance system, NOEL and THOMAS did not perform the 12 a.m. 
count. Nonetheless, NOEL and THOMAS completed and signed a count 
slip for the 12 a.m. count that falsely stated that the 
institutional count had been performed. 
In reliance on that 
falsified count slip, at approximately 12:49 a.m., the Control 
Center cleared the 12 a.m. count. 
22. TOVA NOEL and MICHAEL THOMAS, the defendants, were 
additionally responsible for conducting the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. 
institutional counts in the SHU. As confirmed by video from the 
MCC's internal video surveillance system, NOEL and THOMAS did not 
perform either the 3 a.m. or the 5 a.m. counts. NOEL and THOMAS 
nonetheless completed and signed count slips for both counts that 
falsely stated that they had performed the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. 
institutional counts. In reliance on those falsified count slips, 
EFTA00015461
--- PAGE 25 ---
Caetale2DISLOGGCB319443 Macturreerit22-FilcaleidiE0312Pagla iff 2,021 
at approximately 3:24 a.m. and 5:30 a.m., the Control Center 
cleared the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. counts, respectively. 
23. Moreover, despite the requirement that officers on 
duty in the SHU conduct and document regular, 30-minute rounds, 
TOVA NOEL and MICHAEL THOMAS, the defendants, did not perform any 
of the required 30-minute rounds during their shift between 
approximately 12 a.m. and 6:30 a.m. 
Nonetheless, NOEL completed 
and signed more than 75 separate 30-minute round entries falsely 
affirming that they had, in fact, conducted such rounds. 
24. During the night, instead of completing the 
required counts and rounds, TOVA NOEL and MICHAEL THOMAS, the 
defendants, were seated at the correctional officers' desk in the 
SHU common area (as noted above, approximately 15 feet from 
Epstein's cell), used the computers, and moved around the SHU 
common area. 
For a period of approximately two hours, NOEL and 
THOMAS sat at their desk without moving, and appeared to have been 
asleep. NOEL used the computer periodically throughout the night, 
including to search the Internet for furniture sales and benefit 
websites. THOMAS used the computer briefly around 1 a.m., 4 a.m., 
and 6 a.m. to search for motorcycle sales and sports news. 
25. At approximately 4 a.m., the overnight supervisor 
briefly visited NOEL and THOMAS in the SHU, and conferred with 
NOEL and THOMAS, who were seated at and around the officers' desk, 
EFTA00015462
--- PAGE 26 ---
CaCage21112, 003033113AEr IlDactuntertt22-filcd8ida3305i2Pagag2 13 3021 
before leaving. At approximately 5:30 a.m., another correctional 
officer briefly walked through the SHU common area. Aside from 
those two officers, as confirmed by video surveillance, no one 
else entered the SHU, no one conducted any counts or rounds 
throughout the night, and no one entered the tier in which Epstein 
was housed. 
26. Shortly after 6 a.m. on August 10, 2019, MICHAEL 
THOMAS and TOVA NOEL, the defendants, received a delivery of 
breakfast carts into the SHU, after which time they were again the 
only officers in the SHU. Shortly after 6:30 a.m., NOEL and THOMAS 
walked up to and entered the tier in which Epstein was housed to 
serve breakfast. 
At approximately 6:33 a.m., an alarm was 
activated in the SHU. 
Epstein was alone in his cell and not 
responsive, with a noose around his neck. A supervisor who had 
just started his shift ("Supervisor-1") responded to the alarm 
almost immediately thereafter, and as NOEL approached the door to 
the SHU to open the door for Supervisor-1, NOEL told Supervisor-1 
that "Epstein hung himself." 
After arriving in the SHU, 
Supervisor-1 spoke with THOMAS and NOEL. NOEL told Supervisor-1 
"we did not complete the 3 a.m. nor 5 a.m. rounds." THOMAS stated, 
" we messed up," and "I messed up, she's not to blame, we didn't do 
any rounds."

27. Epstein was transferred to a local hospital where 
he was declared dead shortly thereafter. The Office of the Chief 
Medical Examiner of the City of New York conducted an autopsy and 
determined that Epstein had committed suicide by hanging himself.

and information available to me in my official capacity and about which I have become 
knowledgeable. 
3. 
I submit this supplemental declaration in further support of GOP's motion for 
summary judgment in this case and in opposition to plaintiffs' cross-motion for summary 
judgment. 
4. 
Plaintiffs have raised the issue of whether BOP received FOIA requests for video 
footage before plaintiffs' own request on August 12, 2020. BOP received a separate FOIA

Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 39 Filed 01/15/21 Page 2 of 18 
request (not from plaintiffs) for Metropolitan Correctional Center video records dated August 10, 
2019, the same day BOP turned over the video records to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, 
and this request was logged on August 12, 2019. 
BOP 's Productions Since August 5, 2020 
5. 
On August 11, 2020, BOP produced 77 additional pages of records to plaintiffs, 
consisting of 5 pages released in full and 72 pages released in part. These pages included 
approximately 57 pages of various log books pertaining to Epstein, including approximately 51 
pages of attorney log books showing attorney visits to Epstein. In connection with the GOP's 
releases of pages of log books, I need to make a correction to my declaration filed on August 5, 
2020. In that declaration at Paragraph 22, I stated that BOP had located two pages of scanned 
visitor logs, which it was reviewing and intended to release in part. Instead, BOP located 
approximately 51 pages of copies of scanned attorney log books showing attorney visits to 
Epstein, which it released to plaintiffs with appropriate redactions. 
6. 
Relatedly, at Paragraph 39 of my declaration filed on August 5, 2020, I 
inadvertently stated that BOP had located and produced with redactions a page from a log 
showing a visitor for Epstein on July 30, 2019. In fact, the page (copied onto two pages) that was 
produced to plaintiffs with redactions came from an Intake Screening Phone Log showing that 
Epstein made a phone call on July 30, 2019, not that he received a visit on that date. BOP did not 
produce the cover to this log because it does not refer to Epstein and is non-responsive. Because 
the log book showed a phone call, rather than a visit, Paragraph 36 of my declaration filed on 
August 5, 2020, should be modified to state that BOP also located one physical log book, the 
Intake Screening Phone Log, showing a call made by Epstein on July 30, 2019. 
7. 
On August 31, 2020, BOP produced 351 additional pages of records to plaintiffs, 
consisting of 12 pages released in full and 339 pages released in part. These pages included the 
EFTA00015494
--- PAGE 3 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 39 Filed 01/15/21 Page 3 of 18 
approximately 51 pages of attorney log books, showing attorney visits to Epstein, as attachments 
to email records. 
8. 
In October 2020, BOP reached an agreement with plaintiffs, through counsel, 
pursuant to which the Office of Inspector General of the United States Department of Justice 
("OIG") would produce back to BOP certain records BOP had produced to OIG in connection 
with investigations into Epstein's death, and that BOP would review these records in response to 
plaintiffs' FOIA request. BOP subsequently reached a further agreement with plaintiffs, through 
counsel, that it would not review emails records in OIG's possession, except for emails to or 
from Epstein himself while he was at MCC. BOP has determined that Epstein did not send or 
receive any emails himself while he was at MCC. Specifically, any email sent or received by 
Epstein while he was at MCC would be logged in GOP's Trulincs system, and Trulincs shows 
that Epstein did not send or receive any emails while he was at MCC. Accordingly, BOP did not 
review the email records in OIG's possession. 
9. 
BOP received approximately 7,475 pages of records back from OIG, not 
including emails. I reviewed these pages and determined that approximately 6,898 were non-
responsive or duplicative of records previously reviewed by BOP. Of the remaining pages (the 
"Returned Records"), BOP withheld 387 pages in full, pursuant to Exemptions 6, 7(C), and/or 
7(A). On January 8, 2021, BOP produced the remaining 190 pages of records to plaintiffs, 
consisting of 14 pages released in full and 176 pages released in part. These pages included 8 
pages of records that BOP had previously withheld in full pursuant to Exemption 7(A), but that 
BOP has since determined in consultation with the United States Attorney's Office for the 
Southern District of New York could be released with certain redactions. 
BOP's Updated Index 
EFTA00015495
--- PAGE 4 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 39 Filed 01/15/21 Page 4 of 18 
10. 
Attached as Exhibit 1 to this declaration is an updated index of records withheld 
in full by BOP in this case (the "Updated Index"). The Updated Index includes certain changes 
and additions to the Index submitted as Exhibit 8 to my declaration submitted on August 5, 2020 
(the "Original Index"). 
II. 
The Updated Index reduces the number of pages of count documents noted as 
withheld at Entry 24 by 18 pages. These 18 pages consist of an inmate census roster dated 
August 9, 2019, containing Epstein's name and the names of other inmates held at MCC. Two of 
the 18 eighteen pages, including the page showing Epstein's name, were released in part to 
plaintiffs.' The remaining 16 pages were withheld in full under Exemptions 6 and 7(C) and are 
now included at Entry 59 of the Updated Index, along with pages of other inmate census rosters 
for other dates. 
12. 
The Updated Index omits two entries of the Original Index, Entries 34 and 37, 
consisting of records from the MCC's Special Housing Unit (the "SHU") that BOP determined 
could be released in part, with redactions pursuant to Exemptions 6, 7(A), and 7(C), instead of 
withheld in full pursuant to Exemption 7(A).2 The Updated Index also omits Entry 54, consisting 
The first, cover page of this inmate census roster, as received from BOP, appears to have barely 
legible handwriting on it. BOP located a copy of this pages with the handwriting moderately 
more visible among its previously withheld records. BOP released the version returned by CMG 
with the barely legible handwriting and would have redacted the handwriting pursuant to 
Exemptions, 6, 7(C), 7(E), and/or 7(F) had it released the more legible version. This census 
inmate roster does not appear to specifically concern Epstein (apart from his appearance on one 
page of the roster, which was released in part), and the handwriting does not appear to relate to 
Epstein but instead appears to relate to counting of inmates. 
Of the three pages noted at Entry 37 of the Original Index, two pages were duplicates, with 
handwritten notes on one of the pages. Because those portions of the page were redacted, only 
one copy of these two pages were released in part to plaintiffs. The redacted portions and the 
handwritten portions do not appear to relate to Epstein. In addition, the four pages noted at Entry 
of the Original Index had also been counted in the pages noted at Entry 22, and the page count 
noted at Entry 22 of the Updated Index has been reduced accordingly. 
EFTA00015496
--- PAGE 5 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 39 Filed 01/15/21 Page 5 of 18 
of emails withheld under Exemption 5 and the attorney-client privilege, because plaintiff is not 
challenging the withholding of these records. 
13. 
Entry 19 of the Updated Index includes 12 pages of Epstein's medical records, 
withheld in full under Exemption 7(A), and in part under Exemption 6 and 7(C). On August 31, 
2020, after I submitted my previous declaration, BOP produced 88 pages of Epstein's medical 
records, but withheld in full 12 pages for reasons explained at Paragraph 20 of the August 5, 
2020, declaration of Counsel to the Acting United States Attorney Russell Capone. 
14. 
The Updated Index corrects an inadvertent error that resulted in double counting 
of seventeen pages of emails listed at Entry 52 and twenty-nine pages of emails listed at Entry 
53. 
BOP 's Assertions of Exemptions 5 and 7(E) Over Documents Previously Withheld in Full 
15. 
The Updated Index clarifies that BOP is not asserting Exemptions 5 or 7(E) as a 
basis to withhold certain documents in full. BOP has conducted a further review of certain 
records that previously were withheld in full pursuant to Exemptions 5 and/or 7(E), in addition to 
Exemption 7(A). As a result of that further review, and as reflected on the Updated Index, BOP 
is withdrawing its assertion of Exemption 5 as a basis to withhold in full Entries 1, 2, and 12. 
BOP continues to assert Exemption 5 as a basis to withhold portions of Entries 2 and 12 for the 
reasons explained in my prior declaration, but not Entry 1, as reflected on the Updated Index. All 
of these documents are separately withheld in full pursuant to Exemption 7(A). 
16. 
With respect to the responses to the psychological reconstruction prepared after 
Epstein's death, listed at Entry 12 on the Updated Index, the majority of the pages withheld are 
drafts, containing comments from various perspectives within BOP on versions of the document 
preceding its final version. Five pages of the responses to the psychological reconstruction 
EFTA00015497
--- PAGE 6 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 39 Filed 01/15/21 Page 6 of 18 
prepared after Epstein's death consist of a timeline of events, over which BOP is no longer 
asserting Exemption 5. 
17. 
As a result of its further review, BOP is no longer asserting Exemption 7(E) to 
withhold any document in full. Specifically, and as reflected on the Updated Index, BOP is 
withdrawing its assertion of Exemption 7(E) as a basis to withhold in full Entries 2, 9, 10, 12, 13, 
15, 17, 18, and 36. As reflected on the Updated Index, BOP continues to assert Exemption 7(E) 
as to non-public information in these documents that would reveal investigatory techniques and 
procedures or the specific application thereof, except for Entries 10 and 36, over which BOP no 
longer asserts Exemption 7(E). All of these documents are separately withheld in full pursuant to 
Exemption 7(A). 
18. 
BOP is asserting Exemption 7(E) to protect information in the incident report, 
listed at Entry 1 on the Updated Index, which would reveal specific steps taken in responding to 
an inmate emergency in the Special Housing Unit. Releasing this type of information would 
allow inmates to learn the manner in which MCC staff are likely to respond to emergencies and 
potentially interfere with staff's ability to manage emergency situations. 
19. 
BOP is asserting Exemption 7(E) to protect information in the psychological 
reconstruction of inmate death, listed at Entry 2 on the Updated Index, which would reveal 
particular sources of information that such investigations typically rely on or seek to rely on. 
Specifically, it discusses how the availability or lack thereof of specific sources of information 
affected an investigation, as well as typical sources routinely relied upon. Because of the specific 
constraints under which investigations must proceed in the correctional facility setting, 
identification of sources that are typically relied upon or that are unavailable or relied upon in a 
specific instance are part of BOP investigatory plans and response, and disclosure of sources that 
were unavailable or relied upon or typical sources relied upon could hamper GOP's ability to 
EFTA00015498
--- PAGE 7 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 39 Filed 01/15/21 Page 7 of 18 
conduct investigations in the future by alerting staff and/or inmates to such sources and allowing 
them to take steps to interfere with sources or evidence. 
20. 
BOP is asserting Exemption 7(E) to protect information in the inmate 
investigative report, listed at Entry 9 on the Updated Index, regarding the use of Security Threat 
Group ("STG") designations. STG is an enhanced monitoring technique used to maintain 
balanced prison populations in an effort to protect the safety and security of staff and inmates. 
Inmates are generally not aware of their placement in an STG, and only certain inmates are 
assigned an STG. Not every inmate has an STG assignment. BOP is also asserting Exemption 
7(E) to protect information in the inmate investigative report concerning specific steps taken in 
responding to an inmate emergency in the Special Housing Unit. Releasing this type of 
information would provide an opportunity for inmates to learn the manner in which staff are 
likely to respond to emergencies and potentially interfere with staff's ability to manage 
emergency situations. 
21. 
BOP is asserting Exemption 7(E) to protect information in the responses to the 
psychological reconstruction prepared following Epstein's death, listed at Entry 12 on the 
Updated Index, which would reveal specific steps taken in responding to an inmate emergency in 
the Special Housing Unit. Releasing this type of information would provide an opportunity for 
inmates to learn the manner in which staff are likely to respond to emergencies and potentially 
interfere with staff's ability to manage emergency situations. 
22. 
BOP is asserting Exemption 7(E) to protect information in an August 14, 2019, 
letter, listed at Entry 13 on the Updated Index, that would reveal details about how a BOP team 
investigating an incident, known as an After Action Review Team, conducts an investigation, 
and the access it requires to BOP facilities to complete its work. Release of these details would 
alert staff to systems and information reviewed as part of an investigation and could lead to 
EFTA00015499
--- PAGE 8 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 39 Filed 01/15/21 Page 8 of 18 
attempts to distort, delete, or otherwise manipulate details and data relevant to an investigation. 
Release of the names of members of the After Action Review Team, contained in the August 14, 
2019 letter, would also disclose law enforcement techniques and procedures because the manner 
in which team members are selected, the positions they hold, and the locations from which they 
were chosen and deployed are critical considerations in the assembly of an After Action Review 
Team. Withholding the names of team members protects the investigative process by ensuring 
staff are not aware of who is deemed an appropriate team member and reducing the opportunity 
to attempt to influence the investigation of an event. 
23. 
BOP is asserting Exemption 7(E) to protect information in a memorandum and 
report from Epstein's July 23, 2019 apparent suicide attempt (Form 583), listed at Entry 15 on 
the Updated Index, regarding the use of STG designations, for the reasons stated above with 
regard to the inmate investigation report. BOP is also asserting Exemption 7(E) to protect certain 
information in the memorandum and report from Epstein's July 23, 2019 attempt (Form 583) 
that was obtained from witnesses. In any investigation, identifying witnesses and how an 
interview is conducted, including questions and responses, are critical components of the 
investigatory techniques of security staff of the BOP, especially in a correctional setting where 
there are often multiple witnesses and the correctional setting poses a significant risk of 
contamination or influence of witness by other witnesses and/or other inmates. The investigative 
techniques involved include what witnesses to interview and what procedures must be 
undertaken to ensure the greatest cooperation by the witness during any interview. Witnesses to 
an event might influence each other if they are not separated before any interactions or 
conversations occur between them. In this sense, the investigative techniques, in a correctional 
setting, include strategic decisions that account for the secure and orderly operations of the 
correctional facilities to ensure inmate and staff safety is not put in jeopardy. Disclosure of this 
EFTA00015500
--- PAGE 9 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 39 Filed 01/15/21 Page 9 of 18 
information in the memorandum and report would reveal how the information was gathered and 
could provide an opportunity for inmates to manipulate victims or witnesses to an incident in an 
effort to improperly influence an investigation. 
24. 
BOP is asserting Exemption 7(E) to protect information in a chain of custody 
form, listed at Entry 17 on the Updated Index, about where evidence is stored. Release of this 
information could provide an opportunity for staff to manipulate evidence or the staff responsible 
for controlling it. 
25. 
BOP is asserting Exemption 7(E) to protect information in the reports of Epstein's 
July 23, 2019, apparent suicide attempt, listed at Entry 18 on the Updated Index, regarding 
specific procedures, including notification processes, used in an inmate emergency in the Special 
Housing Unit. Releasing this type of information would provide an opportunity for inmates to 
learn the manner in which staff are likely to respond to emergencies and potentially interfere 
ith staff's ability to manage emergency situations. 
Application of Exemptions to the Returned Records 
26. 
The Updated Index identifies at Entries 55-61 the pages of the Returned Records 
withheld in full by BOP. All of the Returned Records withheld in full by BOP are withheld 
under FOIA Exemption 7(A), except for the 2 pages of records showing transferors of funds to 
Epstein noted at Entry 58 of the Updated Index and the 274 pages of inmate census rosters at 
Entry 59 of the Updated Index, which are withheld under Exemption 6 and 7(C) and discussed 
below. The basis for withholdings of Returned Records under Exemption 7(A) is explained in 
the accompanying supplemental declaration of Counsel to the Acting United States Attorney 
Russell Capone. In addition to the withholdings in full under Exemptions 6, 7(A), and 7(C), 
BOP has also withheld certain portions of Returned Records under Exemptions 6, 7(A), 7(C), 
7(E), and 7(F).

Threshold Justification for Application of Exemption 7 
27. 
As a threshold to applying Exemption 7, an agency has to demonstrate that the 
"records or information [were] compiled for law enforcement purposes." 5 U.S.C. §552(b)(7). 
28. 
As explained at Paragraphs 51-53 of my previous declaration, the BOP is a law 
enforcement agency. 
29. 
All of the Returned Records were compiled for law enforcement_purposes 
because they were compiled in the exercise of GOP's statutory authority to detain certain 
individuals. All of these records relate to GOP's operations and were compiled in order to carry 
out GOP's responsibilities to protect the safety, security, and orderly operation of BOP facilities, 
specifically MCC New York, to protect the public, and/or to protect the safety and care of 
inmates at MCC New York, including Epstein. In addition, as with many of the records 
previously withheld in this matter, the Returned Records were gathered and provided to OIG in 
connection with a law enforcement investigation of Epstein's death. The records at issue in this 
FOIA request meet the law enforcement threshold of Exemption (b)(7). 
Records Withheld Pursuant to Exemptions 6 and 7(C) 
30. 
U.S.C. § 552(b)(6) ("FOIA Exemption 6") protects from disclosure "personnel 
and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted 
invasion of personal privacy." 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(6). 
31. 
U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(C) ("Exemption 7(C)") exempts from disclosure records or 
information compiled for law enforcement purposes where its disclosure "could reasonably be 
expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy." 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(C). 
32. 
Some of the Returned Records withheld by BOP contain personal information 
withheld under Exemptions 6 and 7(C) (the "6 & 7(C) Returned Records"). The 6 & 7(C) 
Returned Records include personnel files within the meaning of Exemption 6, such as daily 
EFTA00015502
--- PAGE 11 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 39 Filed 01/15/21 Page 11 of 18 
assignment rosters for the MCC. The remainder of the 6 & 7(C) Returned Records are "similar 
files" within the meaning of Exemption 6 because they contain information about particular, 
identifiable individuals. This information includes personally identifying information, such as 
names and contact information, of various third-party individuals other than Epstein. 
33. 
Exemptions 6 and 7(C) each require a balancing of the privacy interests 
implicated by disclosure of a record with the public interest in its disclosure. The privacy 
interests implicated by the 6 & 7(C) Returned Records include the privacy interests of BOP 
employees, BOP inmates other than Epstein, visitors or senders of funds to BOP inmates, and 
legal counsel for BOP inmates. The 6 & 7(C) Returned Records contain personally identifying 
information, such as names and contact information, for each of these categories of individuals 
and for some individuals detail their association with Epstein or their involvement in Epstein's 
incarceration. Release of this information—particularly in light of the intense media interest in 
and public speculation concerning Epstein's death—could reasonably be expected to expose 
these third parties to unwanted scrutiny, embarrassment, and even harassment or retaliation. 
34. 
The sole public interest in disclosure to be weighed against these privacy interests 
under both Exemption 6 and 7(C) is the public's understanding of BOP or other government 
operations. The personal information withheld from the 6 and 7(C) Records will not 
significantly contribute to the public's understanding of the operation or activities of BOP or any 
other government agency. The withheld personal information does not provide significant 
insight into government activities or operations in connection with Epstein's incarceration or the 
response of BOP or any other government agency to Epstein's death. 
35. 
The large volume of publicity and often unfounded speculation concerning the 
circumstances of Epstein's death increase the likelihood that disclosure of the information 
EFTA00015503
--- PAGE 12 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 39 Filed 01/15/21 Page 12 of 18 
withheld under Exemptions 6 and 7(C) would cause an unwarranted invasion of personal 
privacy. 
36. 
In light of this public and unfounded speculation about Epstein's death and the 
media coverage thereof, it is reasonable to expect that individuals identified through government 
disclosures as associated with Epstein's incarceration and death, or investigation of the charges 
against Epstein or the circumstances of his death, could be targeted or harassed. Accordingly, 
publicizing the identity, contact information, or other personal information about a particular 
individual's associations or interactions with Epstein will amount to a significant invasion of 
personal privacy, with no meaningful contribution to the public's understanding of how the 
government works. 
37. 
For each category of individuals with personally identifying information present 
in the 6 & 7(C) Returned Records, the individual privacy concerns outweigh the putative public 
interest in their disclosure. 
a. The disclosure of personally identifying information of BOP employees, such 
as their names or contact information, would significantly invade their 
personal privacy without contributing significantly to public understanding of 
how BOP works. Disclosing the names or contact information of individual 
BOP employees does not provide insight into how BOP works. 
b. The disclosure of personally identifying information of BOP inmates, such as 
their names or contact information, would significantly invade their personal 
privacy without contributing significantly to public understanding of how 
BOP works. The names or contact information of particular inmates sheds no 
light on how BOP works. 
c. The disclosure of personally identifying information of visitors or senders of 
funds to BOP inmates, such as their names and contact information, would 
significantly invade their personal privacy without contributing significantly 
to public understanding of how the government works. Identification of 
individuals who visited or sent money to Epstein or other inmates does not 
shed light on BOP conduct or how BOP or any other government agency 
works. 
EFTA00015504
--- PAGE 13 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 39 Filed 01/15/21 Page 13 of 18 
d. The disclosure of personally identifying information of legal counsel to 
Epstein and other BOP inmates, such as their names and contact information, 
would significantly invade their personal privacy without contributing 
significantly to public understanding of how the government works. 
Identification of counsel to Epstein or other inmates does not shed light on 
BOP conduct or how BOP or any other government agency works. 
38. 
Two sets of Returned Records were withheld in full under Exemptions 6 & 7(C). 
One set of the Returned Records, noted at Entry 59 of the Updated Index, consists of 274 pages 
from inmate census rosters for July 23-25 and 27-31, 2019, and August 1-6 and 8-10, 2019. 
Although Epstein's name appears once on each of these rosters, the pages with his name were 
released in part. The 274 pages withheld in full contain no information about Epstein and 
instead list the names and some personal information of other inmates at MCC on those dates. 
Identification of other inmates incarcerated at the same time as Epstein would shed no light on 
BOP's or the government's operations, but would invade the privacy of the other inmates, 
including by associating them with Epstein in a government document. 
39. 
The other set of Returned Records withheld in full under Exemptions 6 & 7(C), 
noted at Entry 58 of the Updated Index, consists of 2 pages showing the transferors of funds to 
Epstein. Specifically, these pages are electronically generated pages containing details of 
transfers of funds to Epstein. The transfers themselves, including the amount of the transfer but 
not the names of the transferors, were documented in pages released in part. The pages withheld 
in full include identifying details of the transferors. The identity of the transferors of funds to 
Epstein would not shed any light on how BOP or the government works, but would invade the 
privacy of the transferors, including by detailing their association with Epstein during his 
incarceration. 
40. 
The release of the personally identifying information in the 6 & 7(C) Returned 
Records would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion under Exemption 6, and, at a minimum, 
EFTA00015505
--- PAGE 14 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 39 Filed 01/15/21 Page 14 of 18 
could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion under Exemption 7(C), of 
the personal privacy of BOP employees, BOP inmates other than Epstein, visitors or senders of 
funds to BOP inmates, or legal counsel for BOP inmates. 
Returned Records Withheld Pursuant to Exemptions 7(E) 
41. 
U.S.C. § 522 (b)(7)(E) ("Exemption 7(E)") exempts from disclosure "records or 
information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of 
such law enforcement records or information ... would disclose techniques and procedures for 
law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law 
enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to 
risk circumvention of the law." 
42. 
Some of the Returned Records withheld in part by BOP contain information about 
or discussion of law enforcement techniques and procedures or guidelines for law enforcement 
investigations or prosecutions (the "7(E) Returned Records"). 
43. 
Portions of the 7(E) Returned Records fall within the scope of Exemption 7(E) 
because they include information or discussions that would disclose law enforcement techniques 
and procedures or guidelines for law enforcement investigations and their use in managing the 
MCC. With one exception, none of the information in the Returned Records withheld by BOP 
under Exemption 7(E) pertains specifically to Epstein. Instead, the information concerns steps 
taken by BOP staff in response to issues at the MCC unrelated to Epstein or primarily routine 
actions taken by BOP staff. Specifically, BOP disclosed in part pages of lieutenant's logs, 
TRUINTEL logs, inmate census roster pages, and an MCC running board page that mention or 
refer to Epstein but also document techniques, procedures, and/or guidelines used in managing 
EFTA00015506
--- PAGE 15 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 39 Filed 01/15/21 Page 15 of 18 
the MCC and enforcing the law there? For example, disclosing details of counts within the MCC 
or the use of body alarms there would disclose law enforcement techniques, procedures, and/or 
guidelines. If the Court requires further information, BOP is prepared to file an ex parte 
supplemental declaration explaining in greater detail the techniques, procedures, and guidelines 
at issue. 
44. 
The one redaction in the 7(E) Returned Records made by BOP pursuant to 
Exemption 7(E) that does pertain specifically to Epstein is the redaction of certain information 
on an electronically generated inmate profile of Epstein that would disclose how BOP classifies 
certain inmates for security purposes. Disclosure of that portion of Epstein's inmate profile 
would disclose a law enforcement technique or procedure by disclosing how BOP classifies 
certain inmates in connection with security issues. 
45. 
Disclosure of the information in the 7(E) Returned Records withheld pursuant to 
Exemption 7(E) would create a risk of circumvention of the law. Disclosure of the information 
would provide inmates or other individuals with details about how MCC works and its security. 
They could use this information to destabilize the MCC and to perpetrate crimes there. 
Returned Records Withheld Pursuant to Exemption 7(F) 
46. 
U.S.C. § 522 (b)(7)(F) ("Exemption 7(F)") exempts from disclosure "records or 
information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of 
such law enforcement records or information ... could reasonably be expected to endanger the 
life or physical safety of any individual." 
Lieutenant's logs withheld in full pursuant to Exemption 7(A), noted at Entry 49 of the 
Updated Index, also contain information that falls with the scope of Exemption 7(E) for the 
reasons discussed here.

47. 
Some of the Returned Records withheld by BOP in full or in part contain 
information that falls within the scope of Exemption 7(F) (the "7(F) Returned Records"). Such 
information falls into two categories. First, disclosure of the personally identifying information, 
such as names and contact information, of third-party individuals employed by BOP could 
reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of these individuals. Second, 
disclosure of certain techniques and procedures used in the management of the MCC could 
reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of BOP employees and inmates 
held by BOP. 
48. 
First, some of the 7(F) Returned Records fall in part within the scope of 
Exemption 7(F) because the release of the personally identifying information contained in these 
records could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of BOP employees 
whose personally identifying information is contained in the 7(F) Returned Records. BOP 
employees work with inmates and criminal defendants who, upon their release from 
incarceration or during their incarceration, might target BOP employees for reprisal. BOP 
employees in many cases live in the cities where they work, frequently utilize public 
transportation, and regularly engage in community and social activities in those cities. The 
release of personally identifying information of BOP employees increases the risks of such 
targeting or harassment because it would make it easier for identified employees to be targeted or 
harassed. Because of the attention and speculation surrounding Epstein's death, it is reasonable 
to expect that individuals identified through disclosures by the government as associated with 
Epstein's incarceration and death could be targeted. 
49. 
Second, some of the 7(F) Returned Records fall in part within the scope of 
Exemption 7(F) because the release of information contained therein would reveal details about 
the operation and management of the MCC that could be used to destabilize the MCC and 
EFTA00015508
--- PAGE 17 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 39 Filed 01/15/21 Page 17 of 18 
perpetrate crimes there, endangering the lives and physical safety of BOP employees and MCC 
inmates. With one exception, none of this information pertains specifically to Epstein. Instead, 
the information concerns steps taken by BOP staff in response to issues at the MCC unrelated to 
Epstein or primarily routine, but sensitive, actions taken by BOP staff. Specifically, BOP 
disclosed in part pages of lieutenant's logs, TRUINTEL logs, inmate census roster pages, an 
MCC running board page, and SHU records that mention or refer to Epstein but also document 
aspects of the MCC and its operations that are not public and could enable individuals to harm 
BOP employees or MCC inmates.4 For example, disclosing certain details of counts within the 
MCC or the use of body alarms there could reasonably be expected to endanger the lives and 
physical safety of BOP employees and MCC inmates. If the Court requires further information, 
BOP is prepared to file an ex parte supplemental declaration explaining in greater detail the 
information at issue. 
50. 
The one set of redactions in the Returned Records made by BOP pursuant to 
Exemption 7(F) that does pertain specifically to Epstein is the redaction of certain information on 
an electronically generated inmate profile of Epstein that would disclose how BOP classifies 
certain inmates for security purposes. Disclosure of those portions of Epstein's inmate profile 
could reasonably be expected to endanger the lives and physical safety of BOP employees and 
MCC inmates by revealing how BOP classifies certain inmates in connection with security 
issues. 
TRUINTEL reports and lieutenant's logs withheld in full pursuant to Exemption 7(A), noted at 
Entries 32 and 49 of the Updated Index, also contain information that falls with the scope of 
Exemption 7(F) for the reasons discussed here.

SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
THE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY, 
Plaintiff, 
v. 
FEDERAL BUREAU OF PRISONS, 
Defendant. 
20-CV-00833 (PAE) 
SUPPLEMENTAL DECLARATION OF NICOLE MCFARLAND 
1, Nicole McFarland, declare as follows: 
1.1 am employed by the United States Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons 
("BOP"), as a Staff Attorney at the Metropolitan Correctional Center ("MCC"). My 
employment history with the BOP is described in a declaration I submitted in the above-
captioned case on August 5, 2020 (the "Declaration"). 
2. I submit this declaration in support of the BOP's motion for summary judgment and to correct 
certain statements in the Declaration that incorrectly described one record that BOP 
produced in response to Plaintiffs' FOIA requests. 
3. In Paragraphs 17 and 30 of the Declaration, I stated that MCC's searches for records 
responsive to Plaintiff's FOIA request had located "one log book showing a visitor for 
Jeffrey Epstein on July 30, 2020." I have since learned that this log book showed a phone 
call Epstein made on July 30, 2020, not a visit that he received on that date. Specifically, the 
log book is an Intake Screening Phone Log kept in the Receiving & Discharging area within 
EFTA00015515
--- PAGE 2 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 38 Filed 01/15/21 Page 2 of 2 
the MCC. 1 advertently described the log as showing a visit, when, in fact, it shows a phone 
call. 
4. For the same reason, Paragraph 28 of the Declaration should be corrected to reflect that the 
searches at MCC located one log showing a phone call made by Epstein on July 30, 2020, 
specifically the Intake Screening Phone Log described above. 
Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746, I declare under the penalty of perjury that the foregoing is 
true and correct.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
THE NEW YORK TIMES COMPANY, 
Plaintiff, 
No. 20-CV-833(PAE) 
v. 
FEDERAL BUREAU OF PRISONS, 
Defendant. 
SUPPLEMENTAL DECLARATION OF RUSSELL CAPONE 
I, Russell Capone, hereby declare as follows: 
I. 
I am Counsel to the Acting United States Attorney for the Southern District of 
New York ("USAO-SDNY"). My prior declaration in this matter dated August 5, 2020, details 
my service in this capacity and prior service in the USAO-SDNY. As noted therein, I am familiar 
with the Freedom of Information Act requests filed by the New York Times Company (the 
"FOIA Requests") that are the subject of this case, which seek records related to the 
incarceration of Jeffrey Epstein at the Metropolitan Correctional Center ("MCC"). I am also 
familiar with the responsive records that defendant the Federal Bureau of Prisons ("BOP") has 
withheld in whole or in part pursuant to various FOIA exemptions, including GOP's 
withholdings from the records provided back to BOP by the Office of the Inspector General of 
the Department of Justice ("OIG") since the submission of my August 5, 2020, declaration. 
2. 
The statements contained in this declaration are based on my personal 
knowledge, documents maintained in the files of the USAO-SDNY, conversations with members 
of the Noel and Tartaglione prosecution teams at the USAO-SDNY, public court filings, and 
conclusions made in accordance therewith. 
EFTA00015517
--- PAGE 2 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 40 Filed 01/15/21 Page 2 of 7 
3. 
I submit this declaration in further support of BOP's motion for summary 
judgment in this case. Specifically, this declaration addresses the bases for the withholding in 
whole or in part of certain records provided back to BOP by OIG pursuant to FOIA Exemption 
7(A). 
Records Withheld in Full or in Part from Disclosure Pursuant to FOIA Exemption 7(A) on 
Account of Likely Interference with Noel 
4. 
U.S.C. § 522 (b)(7)(A) ("Exemption 7(A)") exempts from disclosure "records 
or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production 
of such law enforcement records or information ... could reasonably be expected to interfere 
with enforcement proceedings ...." 
5. 
I and the prosecutors responsible for the Noel prosecution have reviewed each of 
the records provided back to BOP by CMG that BOP withheld in full or in part under Exemption 
7(A) (the "7(A) Returned Records"), including those reflected as withheld in full at Entries 55-
and 60 on the updated index attached to the Supplemental Declaration of Kara Christenson 
(the "updated BOP index"). The 7(A) Returned Records fall into four categories: documents 
related to counts of inmates, staffing records, psychology records, and entries on certain BOP 
logs for August 9 and 10, 2019. Each of these categories fall within the scope of Exemption 
7(A). 
6. 
Public disclosure of the 7(A) Returned Records could reasonably be expected to 
interfere with the pending Noel prosecutions. These records include information about which 
numerous witnesses are expected to testify at trial, details that are not publicly known or known 
to other witnesses, and information and documents prepared by potential trial witnesses. These 
records also include potential trial exhibits, which some or all potential trial witnesses have not 
seen. Premature disclosure of these records and/or the information contained therein could 
EFTA00015518
--- PAGE 3 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 40 Filed 01/15/21 Page 3 of 7 
reasonably be expected to influence witnesses' potential testimony at trial and/or enable 
witnesses to alter or shape their testimony to conform to other evidence. 
7. 
Further, premature public disclosure of any of the 7(A) Returned Records could 
reasonably be expected to impair the government's (and the defendants') ability to seat a fair and 
impartial jury in Noel. The government anticipates that some of these records will be entered 
into evidence as exhibits at trial, and other records that may not be trial exhibits bear on the 
contents of potential trial exhibits. Premature disclosure of these records and/or the information 
contained therein could influence potential jurors' understanding of the evidence at trial and the 
case overall. Similarly, premature disclosure of the records and/or the information contained 
therein could prejudice potential jurors for or against the defendants in the Noel action, which 
would also impair the government's (and the defendants') ability to seat a fair and impartial jury. 
In addition, as noted above, these records include specific information about which witnesses are 
expected to testify at trial, as well as information and documents prepared by potential trial 
witnesses, such that premature public disclosure could reasonably be expected to influence 
potential jurors' perception of the witnesses and the evidence to be presented at trial. 
8. 
The risks of interference with the Noel proceedings are heightened by the media 
coverage of speculation and theories about Epstein's death. Many publicly-discussed theories of 
Epstein's death are unfounded. Premature release of the withheld records, particularly if the 
records are released in part or without full context, may influence the perception of jurors who 
have been exposed to such media coverage of speculation and theories. 
9. 
The considerations discussed above apply to each of the categories of 7(A) 
Returned Records. 
10. 
First, as discussed in my prior declaration, the government anticipates that 
documents related to counts of inmates, including count slips, associated inmate rosters, and 
EFTA00015519
--- PAGE 4 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 40 Filed 01/15/21 Page 4 of 7 
records of rounds and checks, for dates between and including July 23, 2019, and August 12, 
2019, will be the subject of trial testimony at the Noel trial. 7(A) Returned Records containing 
such documents are noted at Entry 55 of the updated BOP index.' In addition, the government 
anticipates that some of these documents will be trial exhibits. Releasing these materials 
prematurely could reasonably be expected to influence witnesses' potential testimony at trial, 
allow witnesses to alter or shape their testimony to conform to other evidence, identify potential 
government witnesses at the Noel trial, and/or influence potential jurors' perceptions of witness 
testimony or evidence. 
II. 
One subcategory of these documents are records from the Special Housing Unit 
(the "SHU"), specifically rosters of inmates in the SHU on August 9 and 10, 2019, and SHU 
records showing which BOP employees conducted rounds in the SHU. Although BOP had 
previously withheld six pages of these records in full, included at Entries 22, 34 and 37 of the 
prior index submitted by BOP, the prosecutors responsible for the Noel prosecution and I 
determined that these records could be released in part without interfering with the Noel 
prosecution, provided that information on these records showing details of the occupants of the 
SHU on August 9 and 10, 2019, and which BOP employees conducted rounds in the SHU was 
redacted. Releasing such information prematurely could reasonably be expected to influence 
witnesses' potential testimony at trial, allow witnesses to alter or shape their testimony to 
In reviewing the records returned to BOP by OIG, the prosecutors responsible for the Noel and 
Tartaglione prosecutions and I determined that a one-page attorney visit room inventory log, 
dated July 21, 2019, and an 18-page inmate census roster, dated August 9, 2019, each of which 
BOP had previously withheld in full under Exemption 7(A), could be released without a 
reasonable expectation of interference with the Noel or Tartaglione prosecutions. The attorney 
visit room inventory log was previously listed at Entry 26 of GOP's index, and the census roster 
was previously included among the count documents noted at Entry 24 of GOP's index. 
EFTA00015520

Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 40 Filed 01/15/21 Page 5 of 7 
conform to other evidence, identify potential government witnesses at the Noel trial, and/or 
influence potential jurors' perceptions of witness testimony or evidence. 
12. 
Second, as discussed in my prior declaration, the government anticipates that 
MCC staffing records, including daily assignment rosters for the MCC on July 23, August 9, and 
10, 2019, will be the subject of witness testimony at the Noel trial. 7(A) Returned Records 
containing such documents are noted at Entry 56 of the updated BOP index? In addition, the 
government anticipates that some of these documents will be trial exhibits. Releasing these 
materials prematurely could reasonably be expected to influence witnesses' potential testimony 
at trial, allow witnesses to alter or shape their testimony to conform to other evidence, and/or 
influence potential jurors' perceptions of witness testimony or evidence. 
13. 
Third, as discussed in my prior declaration, the government anticipates that 
certain psychological notes and records of Epstein prepared by BOP may be trial exhibits, the 
subject of witness testimony, and/or were prepared by witnesses who will testify at trial. 7(A) 
Returned Records containing such documents are noted at Entry 57 of the updated BOP index. 
Premature disclosure of these records could influence the testimony of potential witnesses, 
including by potentially causing them to alter or shape their testimony to conform to other 
evidence. In addition, premature disclosure of these records could reasonably be expected to 
prejudice potential jurors for or against the defendants in the Noel action, which would impair 
the government's (and the defendants') ability to seat a fair and impartial jury. 
14. 
Fourth, as discussed in my prior declaration, the government anticipates that 
entries in certain BOP logs for August 9 and 10, 2019, may be trial exhibits, the subject of 
The daily assignment rosters included in the 7(A) Returned Records appear identical to the 
daily assignment rosters BOP previously located and withheld in response to the FOIA Requests, 
except that they contain a different date stamp, which I understand to indicate when they were 
electronically generated. 
EFTA00015521

Case 1:20-cv-00833-PAE Document 40 Filed 01/15/21 Page 6 of 7 
witness testimony, and/or were prepared by witnesses who will testify at trial. 7(A) Returned 
Records containing such documents are noted at Entry 60 of the updated BOP index. Premature 
disclosure of these materials could reasonably be expected to influence witnesses' potential 
testimony at trial, allow witnesses to alter their testimony to conform to other evidence, and/or 
influence potential jurors' perceptions of witness testimony or evidence. 
7(A) Returned Records Withheld in Part from Disclosure Pursuant to Exemption 7(A) on 
Account of Likely Interference with Tartaglione 
15. 
The release of portions of two 7(A) Returned Records could also be reasonably 
expected to interfere with the Tartaglione prosecution. First, portions of psychological records, 
withheld in full as noted at Entry 57 of the updated BOP index, concerning the circumstances of 
Epstein's apparent suicide attempt on July 23, 2019, could reasonably be expected to interfere 
with the prosecution of Tartaglione. Second, premature release of one of the entries in a 
lieutenant's log dated July 23, 2019, concerning the circumstances of Epstein's apparent suicide 
attempt on that date, could reasonably be expected to interfere with the prosecution of 
Tartaglione.

As discussed in my prior declaration, Tartaglione's interactions with Epstein in 
July 2019 have been placed at issue by Tartaglione's defense counsel, specifically in connection 
with the potential penalty phase of the case against Tartaglione. See Letter dated January 13, 
2010, Dkt. No. 186, United States v. Tartaglione, No. 16 Cr. 832 (KMK); Letter dated January 
21, 2020, Dkt. No. 193, United States v. Tartaglione, No. 16 Cr. 832 (KMK). In light of defense 
counsel's position, the information contained in the psychological records and in the entry in the 
lieutenant's log may be relevant evidence in any possible penalty phase of the case against 
Tartaglione. In that event, premature release of the information could reasonably be expected to

The 7(A) Returned Records withheld in full are exempt from disclosure in their 
entirety under Exemption 7(A). To the extent the records contain any non-exempt information, 
such information is inextricably intertwined with information that could reasonably be expected 
to interfere with the Noel prosecution for the reasons discussed above. As noted in my previous 
declaration, the media coverage of speculation and theories about Epstein's death makes the 
segregation of any possibly non-exempt information particularly difficult because providing 
information pertaining to Epstein without complete context risks contributing to the 
dissemination of speculation and theories about his death. This, in turn, could reasonably be 
expected to interfere with the district court's ability to seat a fair and impartial jury in Noel, for 
the reasons discussed above. 
Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true 
and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

New York, New York 10007 
Re: 
United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 (RMB) 
Dear Judge Berman: 
The Government respectfully submits this letter in response to the defendant's Motion for 
Pretrial Release (the "Release Motion"), dated July 11, 2019 (Dkt. 6), and in further support of its 
Memorandum in Support of Detention (the "Detention Memo"), submitted to Magistrate Judge 
Pitman on July 8, 2019, which is attached hereto and incorporated herein (Ex. A). 
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 
The defendant is a serial sexual predator who is charged with abusing underage girls for 
years. A grand jury has returned an indictment alleging that he sexually exploited dozens of 
minors, including girls as young as 14 years old, in New York and Florida. To this day, he is a 
registered sex offender designated by New York State in the highest category of risk to reoffend, 
despite unsuccessfully attempting to have that classification lowered. And any doubt that the 
defendant is unrepentant and unreformed was eliminated when law enforcement agents discovered 
hundreds or thousands of nude and seminude photographs of young females in his Manhattan 
mansion on the night of his arrest, more than a decade after he was first convicted of a sex crime 
involving a juvenile. 
The defendant also faces substantial evidence of his guilt, founded on the corroborated 
testimony of numerous victims, and this case presents the very real possibility that he will go to 
prison for the rest of his life. The defendant has at his disposal a vast fortune, the details of which 
remain largely concealed from the Court. He also has a history of obstruction and manipulation 
of witnesses, including, as detailed herein, as recently as within the past year, when media reports 
about his conduct reemerged. And he continues to show a shocking lack of understanding of the 
gravity of the harm he has perpetrated, including through the minimization of his conduct and 
casual disparagement of victims in his arguments. 
Against this backdrop of significant—and rapidly-expanding—evidence, serious charges, 
and the prospect of a lengthy prison sentence, the defendant proposes to be released on conditions 
that are woefully inadequate. The Release Motion misconstrues and misunderstands the relevant

law, seeks to diminish and demean the harm caused to the many victims of the defendant's 
appalling sexual abuse, and utterly fails to meet its burden of rebutting the presumption that no 
condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as 
required and the safety of the community. Rather than even attempting to address the grave risks 
of releasing a defendant with extraordinary financial resources and a history of abusing minors, 
the defendant instead proposes a bail package that amounts to little more than a barely-secured 
bond masquerading as a 14-point plan. The Court should reject the defendant's application and 
order him detained pending trial. 
Among other things, the proposed bail package contemplates the defendant pledging as the 
principal security a property that has already been identified by the Government as subject to 
forfeiture upon the defendant's conviction, and which therefore is of no value as collateral. His 
proposed global waiver of extradition is unenforceable, and even if enforceable would be little 
comfort to victims forced to wait additional years while the defendant is located and returned to 
this country. The promise to "deregister or otherwise ground" his private jet is meaningless given 
his wealth and ability to easily secure other means of travel. The two co-signers he proposes only 
further highlight his minimal community ties, including his lack of any family in or near the 
District. Electronic monitoring would merely give the defendant less of a head start in fleeing—
and does not guard against the risk of him endangering victims in the very home where he has 
continued to hoard nude images of young women and girls. And the private security force he 
proposes to guard his gilded cage, a proposal already rejected by this Court in similar 
circumstances, simply reinforces the obvious fact that the defendant should be housed where he 
can be secured at all times: a federal correctional center. 
The defendant faces a presumption of detention, Pretrial Services has recommended 
detention, and victims of the defendant seek his detention. Because there are no set of conditions 
short of incarceration that can reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant or reasonably 
protect the community from the dangers he poses if released, the Court should order him detained. 
BACKGROUND 
As previously set forth, a federal grand jury in this District returned an indictment (the 
"Indictment") charging the defendant with violating Title 18, United States Code Section 1519, 
and conspiracy to commit the same. 
As charged by the grand jury, the facts giving rise to those counts involve a years-long 
scheme to sexually abuse underage girls. Specifically, the defendant enticed and recruited dozens 
of minor girls to engage in sex acts with him, for which he paid the victims hundreds of dollars in 
cash, in at least two different states. Victims were initially recruited to provide "massages" to the 
defendant, which would be performed nude or partially nude, would become increasingly sexual 
in nature, and would typically include one or more sex acts, including groping and direct or indirect 
contact with victims' genitals. To perpetuate this exploitation of underage girls, the defendant 
actively encouraged certain victims to recruit additional girls to be similarly sexually abused. He 
paid these victim-recruiters hundreds of dollars for each additional girl they brought to him, 
creating a network of underage victims for him to exploit in New York and Palm Beach.

The defendant, through counsel, continues to evidence a complete lack of appreciation for 
the gravity of the offenses with which he is charged.' As an initial matter, there can be no plausible 
suggestion that the allegations against the defendant involve isolated or aberrational conduct; they 
involve repeated, regular acts of sexual abuse committed over a period of many years. And 
following the defendant's prior conviction, as described previously by the Government, the 
defendant continued to maintain at least hundreds and possibly thousands of nude photos of young 
subjects. The defendant's victims in this case, often particularly vulnerable girls, were as young 
as 14 years old when he abused them. The defendant knew he was abusing minors, including 
because victims told him directly they were underage. And he preyed on his victims habitually 
and repeatedly—day after day, month after month, year after year. 
The defense calls these disturbing alleged acts "simple prostitution!' Mag. Tr. 12:12; see 
also D. Tr. at 6:15-19 ("This is basically the Feds today . . . redoing the same conduct that was 
investigated 10 years ago and calling it, instead of prostitution, calling it sex trafficking"). That 
characterization is not only offensive but also utterly irrelevant given that federal law does not 
recognize the concept of a child prostitute—there are only trafficking victims—because a child 
cannot legally consent to being exploited. 
Defense counsel's repeated assertion that the 
Government's case is infirm because no threats or coercion are alleged—e.g., Mag. Tr. at 12 
("There was no coercion. There were no threats. There was no violence."), 17 ("there was no 
coercion. There was no intimidation. There is no deception."); Release Motion at 2 ("There are 
no allegations . . . that he forced, coerced, defrauded, or enslaved anybody . . . .")—is equally 
irrelevant because the offense with which the defendant has been charged requires no such proof. 
See, e.g., United States v. Afrare, 632 F. App'x 272, 278 (6th Cir. 2016) ("We hold that § 1591(a) 
criminalizes the sex trafficking of children (less than 18 years old) with or without any force, fraud, 
or coercion, and it also criminalizes the sex trafficking of adults (18 or older), but only if done by 
force, fraud, or coercion."). 
Far more important, the defense has already effectively conceded that the Government will 
be able to present evidence of the actual primary elements of the charged offense—i.e., that the 
defendant engaged in sex acts for money with girls he knew were underage. See Release Motion 
at 2. On this record, the Government agrees with Pretrial Services that the defendant should be 
detained pending trial. He poses a tremendous risk of flight and a danger to the community, and 
he cannot overcome the statutory presumption in favor of detention in this case. 
' Such arguments are unsurprising from a defendant who previously compared himself to a "person 
who steals a bagel" or a tragic mythical figure. See, e.g., Amber Southerland, Billionaire Jeffrey 
Epstein: I'm a sex offender, not a predator, N.Y. Post (2011) ("I'm not a sexual predator, I'm an 
"offender," the financier told The Post yesterday. `It's the difference between a murderer and a 
person who steals a bagel.'"); Philip Weiss, The Fantasist, NY Magazine (2007) ("`It's the Icarus 
story, someone who flies too close to the sun,' I said. 'Did Icarus like massages?' Epstein asked."). 
"Mag. Tr." refers to the transcript of the hearing before Magistrate Judge Pitman on July 8, 2019; 
"D. Tr." refers to the transcript of the hearing before this Court on July 8, 2019.

Honorable Richard M. Berman 
United States District Judge 
July 12, 2019 
Page 4 
ARGUMENT 
The Government respectfully submits that the defendant cannot overcome the statutory 
presumption in favor of detention in this case for the following reasons, among others: 
I. 
Victims Seek Detention 
Pursuant to the Crime Victims' Rights Act ("CVRA"), a crime victim has the right to be 
reasonably heard at certain public proceedings in the district court, including proceedings 
involving release. 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(4). Consistent with that requirement, the Government has 
been in contact with victims and counsel identified through this investigation in connection with 
the argument regarding bail. 
Multiple victims and/or their counsel have asked the Government to seek detention (and to 
inform the Court of their views in that respect) for multiple reasons. First, they believe that the 
defendant's continued detention is necessary under the CVRA's right to be reasonably protected 
from the accused. 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(1). They have specifically conveyed to the Government 
that they would be fearful for their safety if the defendant were released. For the reasons articulated 
herein, the Government believes those concerns to be well-founded. 
Additionally, certain victims have asked the Government to advise the Court that they are 
specifically concerned about the defendant's proposal to be released even if under conditions that 
included home detention and full-time private guards. They believe it would be unfair to victims 
of a wealthy defendant, like Epstein, if he were to be given greater freedoms than others would be 
in similar circumstances, and that such an arrangement would be inconsistent with their rights. 
They specifically asked the Government to advise the Court that they believed such an arrangement 
could result in harassment and abuse by the defendant. 3
II. 
The Defendant's Proposal Does Nothing to Mitigate His Flight Risk 
Each of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk—the nature and circumstances 
of the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant—
counsel strongly in favor of detention, and the defendant's proposed package would do nothing 
whatsoever to mitigate those risks. 
A. Defendant Proposes No Infringement Upon His Ability to Use his Vast Wealth to Flee 
It might not be immediately apparent to a reader of the Release Motion that the defendant 
is extravagantly wealthy and worth, according to records relating to the defendant recently 
obtained by the Government from a financial institution ("Institution-1"), more than $500 million. 
The Government is aware of at least one additional attorney for a victim who has publicly stated 
that her client supports the pretrial detention of the defendant. The Government is unaware of any 
victim who has expressed support for the defendant being granted pretrial release on bail.

Page 5 
Indeed, while the defendant has still not filled out a financial affidavit, under penalty of 
perjury, in connection with his application for bail, his token effort to account for his finances 
makes painfully clear the need for detention. The defendant reports having an extraordinary 
amount of money in both total assets and cash or cash-equivalent holdings. And while the 
defendant repeatedly represents in his Release Motion that his assets are "in the United States," 
there is absolutely nothing in the defendant's minimal financial submission to verify that. 
Indeed, and as discussed further below, even assuming the defendant's assets are presently 
in the United States, nothing in the proposed package would prevent the defendant from 
transferring liquid assets out of the country quickly and in anticipation of flight or relocation. The 
defendant is an incredibly sophisticated financial actor with decades of experience in the industry 
and significant ties to financial institutions and actors around the world. He could easily transfer 
funds and holdings on a moment's to places where the Government would never find them so as 
to ensure he could live comfortably while a fugitive. 
But perhaps most important, even were the defendant to sacrifice literally all of his current 
assets, there is every indication that he would immediately be able to resume making millions or 
tens of millions of dollars per year outside of the United States. He already earns at least 
$10,000,000 per year, according to records from Institution-1, while living in the U.S. Virgin 
Islands, traveling extensively abroad, and residing in part in Paris, France; there would be little to 
stop the defendant from fleeing, transferring his unknown assets abroad, and then continuing to do 
whatever it is he does to earn his vast wealth from a computer terminal beyond the reach of 
extradition.4
That the defendant faces up to 45 years of incarceration on the current counts with which 
he is charged provides the motive for him do so and is another significant factor in assessing the 
risk of flight. See United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 7 (2d Cir. 1987). So too is the strength of 
the evidence, detailed above and in the Government's Detention Memo. Indeed, that evidence, 
already robust less than a week ago when the Indictment was unsealed, is growing stronger by the 
day. Just since the Indictment was unsealed, several additional women, in multiple jurisdictions, 
have identified themselves to the Government as having been victimized by the defendant when 
they were minors. Moreover, pursuant to judicially-authorized search warrants, the Government 
has discovered and seized a significant volume of photographs of nude and seminude young 
women and girls in the defendant's Manhattan residence, and is in the process of reviewing dozens 
of electronic discs that contain still more such photos? And dozens of individuals have called the 
Government in recent days to convey information regarding the defendant and the allegations 
As noted in the Government's Detention Memo, the defendant is a frequent traveler and regularly 
travels to and from the United States, including approximately more than 20 flights in which he 
traveled to or from a foreign country since 2018 alone. Extensive international travel of this nature 
further demonstrates a significant risk of flight. See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp. 
2d 32, 36 (D.D.C. 2005). 
The Government's review of these materials, seized earlier this week, remains ongoing.

contained in the Indictment. All this in less than a week, and all in addition to an Indictment that 
already alleges the existence of dozens of victims in New York and dozens of victims in Florida. 
B. The Proposed Bond is Inadequate to Overcome the Presumption of Detention 
The defendant's "slate of highly restrictive" measures which purportedly "amply suffice to 
secure his release" are neither highly restrictive nor amply sufficient. Rather, they are effectively 
standard conditions of home confinement, monitoring, and bond unsecured by the defendant's 
assets—broken out into 14 pieces. The Government will address the most concerning and salient 
elements of the defendant's proposal below. 
I. Lack of Meaningful Bond Security 
The defendant proposes that the Court accept his Manhattan mansion as the primary 
security for a personal recognizance bond of an indeterminate amount, to be co-signed by the 
defendant's brother and a friend. Release Motion at 4. This is plainly insufficient. 
As an initial matter, and as noted above, the defendant's Manhattan mansion has been 
identified in the Indictment as subject to forfeiture because it is alleged to have been used to 
commit or facilitate the commission of the sex trafficking offenses charged there. See 18 U.S.C. 
§ 1594(c)(1). 
Because the defendant would thus be likely to lose that property following a 
conviction, it provides no value whatsoever as collateral. See 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g)(4) ("In 
considering the conditions of release described . . . the judicial officer . . . shall decline to accept 
the designation, or the use as collateral, of property that, because of its source, will not reasonably 
assure the appearance of the person as required."). And while the defendant offers to also pledge 
his private jet as additional collateral, there is absolutely no reason to assume that the defendant 
would not readily trade his private plane for his freedom. Indeed, the defendant, who has a net 
worth of more than $500 million, by his own admission recently sold a second plane and thus 
presumably has cash on hand to replace the posted aircraft without difficulty if need be. 
Nor does the proposed security of properties owned by two identified co-signers 
meaningfully change the calculus. As further described below, the defendant provides no 
information about the value or equity of the property of his brother, Mark (the "Palm Beach 
Property"), or the significance of that property in the context of his brother's own net worth!' 
Similarly, the defendant provides no details regarding the "investment interests" of his friend Mr. 
Mitchell, nor any reason to believe the loss of those "interests" would be meaningful to Mr. 
Mitchell, let alone the defendant. More generally, given the defendant's proffered net worth, the 
defendant could easily make his co-signers whole — and even reward them — were he to flee. 
The proposed security, in sum, should give the Court little comfort the defendant would 
appear in Court if released on bail. 
In fact, the defendant's own submission makes clear that the Palm Beach Property is not his 
brother's exclusive residence and that his brother lives elsewhere for half of the year.

2. Co-Signers, Moral Suasion, and Ties to the Community 
The dearth of detailed financial information about the defendant himself, much less his 
brother or friend, further shows the hollowness of the proposal. The Court cannot possibly 
evaluate whether there would be any incentive whatsoever for those the two proposed co-signers 
to exercise moral suasion over the defendant—or whether, as noted above, the defendant could 
easily compensate them, perhaps many times over, for any loss they incurred through the 
defendant's flight from justice. The defendant provides no information about his brother other 
than that he lives half the year in the home he purportedly would pledge, and even less information 
about Mr. Mitchell, other than that he is "Mr. Epstein's friend," his "close personal friend of 
decades," and his "close personal friend." Release Motion at 4, 9. Their willingness to "guarantee" 
his appearance, Release Motion at 9, is meaningless in the absence of such information. 
Moreover, the notion that any individual co-signer could meaningfully secure a bond for 
this defendant strains credulity. Given the defendant's wealth and his extraordinary risk of flight, 
any bond for this defendant would assuredly have to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars to 
even be claimed to be sufficient to guard against the risks posed by the defendant's release. The 
defendant offers no reason to believe any co-signers could meaningfully sign such a bond, much 
less these two particular individuals, which is yet another reason the proposed package is patently 
insufficient. 
3. The Defendant's "Consent" to Extradition is Unenforceable and Impractical 
The defendant's offer to sign a so-called "consent" to extradition provides no additional 
reassurance whatsoever. As an initial matter, the Government would need to find and re-arrest the 
defendant before such a waiver would even come into play. Moreover, even assuming the 
Government could locate and apprehend the defendant, numerous courts have recognized that such 
purported waivers are unenforceable and effectively meaningless because any defendant who signs 
such a purported waiver and then flees will assuredly contest the validity and/or voluntariness of 
the waiver, and will get to do so in the jurisdiction of his choosing (Le., the one to which he chose 
to flee). See, e.g., United States v. Morrison, No. 16-MR-118, 2016 WL 7421924, at *4 (W.D.N.Y. 
Dec. 23, 2016); United States v. Kazeem, No. 15 Cr. 172, 2015 WL 4645357, at *3 (D. Or. Aug. 
3, 2015); United States v. Young, Nos. 12 Cr. 502, 12 Cr. 645, 2013 WL 12131300, at *7 (D. Utah 
Aug. 27, 2013); United States v. Cohen, No. C 10-00547, 2010 WL 5387757, at *9 n.11 (N.D. 
Cal. Dec. 20, 2010); United States v. Bohn, 330 F. Supp. 2d 960, 961 (W.D. Tenn. 2004); United 
States v. Stroh, No. 396 Cr. 139, 2000 WL 1832956, at *5 (D. Conn. Nov. 3, 2000); United States 
v. Botero, 604 F. Supp. 1028, 1035 (S.D. Fla. 1985). . The Department of Justice's Office of 
International Affairs is unaware of any country anywhere in the world that would consider an 
anticipatory extradition waiver binding. And, of course, the defendant could choose to flee to a 
jurisdiction with which the United States does not have an extradition treaty. 
Beyond being impossible to guarantee, extradition is typically a lengthy, complicated and 
expensive process, and the possibility that it would be successful neither provides any real 
deterrent to the defendant's incentive to flee nor any measure of justice to the victims who would 
be required to wait years for his return.

4. Home Confinement and Electronic Monitoring Provide No Assurance 
The defendant's proposal of ankle-bracelet monitoring should be of no comfort to the 
Court. In particular, the defendant's endorsement of a GPS monitoring bracelet rather than a radio 
frequency bracelet is farcical because neither one is useful or effective after it has been removed. 
At best, home confinement and electronic monitoring would reduce his head start should he decide 
to cut the bracelet and flee. See United States v. Zarger, No. 00 Cr. 773, 2000 WL 1134364, at *1 
(E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2000) (rejecting defendant's application for bail in part because home detention 
with electronic monitoring "at best . . . limits a fleeing defendant's head start"); see also United 
States v. Casteneda, No. 18 Cr. 047, 2018 WL 888744, at *9 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 2018) (same); United 
States v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp.2d 32, 41 (D.D.C. 2005) (same); United States v. Benatar, No. 02 
Cr. 099, 2002 WL 31410262, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 10, 2002) (same). 
5. Private Security is Inadequate, Unfair, and Impractical Here 
The defendant also proposes the use of a private security force to march him to and from 
court under the threat of deadly force. This proposal should be rejected. 
At the outset, it is far from clear that private jail, which seeks to replicate the conditions of 
a government-run detention facility in the defendant's home, is a condition of "release" that 
implicates the Bail Reform Act. "[T]here is a debate within the judiciary over whether a defendant, 
if she is able to perfectly replicate a private jail in her own home at her own cost, has a right to do 
so under the Bail Reform Act and the United States Constitution." United States v. Valerio, 9 F. 
Supp. 3d 283, 292 (E.D.N.Y. 2014) (Bianco, J.) (collecting cases). The Second Circuit has never 
directly addressed this issue. See United States v. Sabhnani, 493 F.3d 63, 78 n.18 (2d Cir. 2007) 
("The government has not argued and, therefore, we have no occasion to consider whether it would 
be `contrary to the principles of detention and release on bail' to allow wealthy defendants 'to buy 
their way out by constructing a private jail." (citations omitted)). Indeed, a decision by this Court 
reasoned that "the very severe restrictions" in the private jail proposal presented to him did "not 
appear to contemplate 'release' so much as it describes a very expensive form of private jail or 
detention." United States v. Zarrab, 2016 WL 3681423, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. June 16, 2016). 
Courts have long been troubled by private jail proposals like the defendant's which, "at 
best 'elaborately replicate a detention facility without the confidence of security such a facility 
instills."' United States v. Orena, 986 F.2d 628, 632 (2d Cir. 1993) (quoting United States v. Gotti, 
776 F. Supp. 666, 672 (E.D.N.Y. 1991) (rejecting private jail proposal)); see also Valerio, 9 F. 
Supp. 3d at 295 ("The questions about the legal authorization for the private security firm to use 
force against defendant should he violate the terms of his release, and the questions over whether 
the guards can or should be armed, underscore the legal and practical uncertainties—indeed, the 
imperfections-of the private jail-like concept envisioned by defendant, as compared to the more 
secure option of an actual jail."). A private security firm simply cannot replicate the controlled 
environment of a federal correctional facility, in which, typically, all of the needs to the prisoner 
can be attended to without placing the prisoner in the community at large; the defendant's proposed 
private jail arrangement would have the effect of permanently placing him in just such a high-
flight-risk circumstance. The risk of a public escape attempt while in the community and involving

Page 9 
armed private guards attempting to stop the defendant, potentially by force—rather than the 
defendant being in the environment of a federal facility—also greatly magnifies the danger of the 
defendant's flight to the public. See United States v. Boustani, 356 F. Supp. 3d 246, 257 (E.D.N.Y. 
2019). "This is why, as the Government correctly notes, federal prisoners should be detained in 
facilities run by trained personnel from federal correctional facilities." Id. at 258 (citing Sablznani, 
493 F.3d at 74 n.13 ("To the extent [armed private guards] implies an expectation that deadly force 
may need to be used to assure defendant['s] presence at trial... [s]uch a conclusion would, in fact, 
demand a defendant's detention")). 
The Second Circuit has held it is not legal error "for a district court to decline to accept," 
as "a substitute for detention," a defendant hiring private security guards to monitor him. United 
States v. Bank, 369 Fed. App'x 152, 153-54 (2d Cir. 2010). In the same decision, the Second 
Circuit noted that it was "troubled" by the possibility of "allow[ing] wealthy defendants to buy 
their way out by constructing a private jail." (internal quotation marks omitted)). Id.; accord, e.g., 
United States v. Cilins, No. 13 Cr. 315 (WHP), 2013 WL 3802012, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. July 19, 2013) 
("it is contrary to underlying principles of detention and release on bail that individuals otherwise 
ineligible for release should be able to buy their way out by constructing a private jail, policed by 
security guards not trained or ultimately accountable to the Government, even if carefully 
selected' (quoting Borodin v. Ashcroft, 136 F. Supp. 2d 125, 134 (E.D.N.Y. 2001))); Valerio, 9 
F. Supp. 3d at 293-94 (E.D.N.Y. 2014) ("There is nothing in the Bail Reform Act that would 
suggest that a defendant (or even, hypothetically, a group of defendants with private funding) has 
a statutory right to replicate or construct a private jail in a home or some other location."). 
The defendant's payment of his guards also raises the conflict of interest inherent in having 
the defendant having extraordinary influence over a private security company tasked with guarding 
him, leaving the company's incentives entirely aligned with the defendant. See, e.g., Boustani, 
356 F. Supp. 3d at 257 (in finding that private armed guards would not reasonably assure the 
appearance of a defendant, noting a "clear conflict of interest—private prison guards paid by an 
inmate" and noting that in a recent S.D.N.Y. case involving private security guards the defendant 
"was outside of his apartment virtually all day, every weekday; was visited by a masseuse for a 
total of 160 hours in a 30-day period; and went on an unauthorized visit to a restaurant in 
Chinatown with his private guards in tow"); see also United States v. Tajideen, 17 Cr. 046, 2018 
WL 1342475, at *5-6 (D.D.C. Mar. 15, 2018) (finding Zarrab "particularly instructive" and further 
noting: "While the Court has no reason to believe that the individuals selected for the defendant's 
security detail would intentionally violate federal law and assist the defendant in fleeing the Court's 
jurisdiction, it nonetheless is mindful of the power of money and its potential to corrupt or 
undermine laudable objectives. And although these realities cannot control the Court's ruling, they 
also cannot be absolutely discounted or ignored."). 
Finally, in Zarrab this Court found that "the Defendant's privately funded armed guard 
proposal is unreasonable because it helps to foster inequity and unequal treatment in favor of a 
very small cohort of criminal defendants who are extremely wealthy, such as Mr. Zarrab." 2016 
WL 3681423, at *13; see also Boustani, 356 F. Supp. 3d at 258 ("although this Defendant has vast 
financial resources to construct his own `private prison,' the Court is not convinced 'disparate 
treatment based on wealth is permissible under the Bail Reform Act", (quoting United States v.

Bruno, 89 F. Supp. 3d 425, 432 (E.D.N.Y. 2015) ("Even if Defendant had the financial capacity 
to replicate a private jail within his own home, this Court is not convinced that such a set of 
conditions would be sufficiently effective in this case to protect the community from Defendant, 
or that such disparate treatment based on wealth is permissible under the Bail Act.")); Borodin, 
136 F. Supp. 2d at 134 (E.D.N.Y. 2001) (Nickerson, J.) ("It is contrary to underlying principles of 
detention and release on bail that individuals otherwise ineligible for release should be able to buy 
their way out by constructing a private jail, policed by security guards not trained or ultimately 
accountable to the government, even if carefully selected."). 
If the defendant's appearance can only be assured through use of round-the-clock guards, 
the defendant belongs in a federal detention center, not released under bail conditions that 
effectively create a private prison of one, using guards to be paid by the defendant himself. It is 
frankly outrageous for the defendant to suggest that preventing him from using his vast wealth to 
duplicate a private prison that cannot control, monitor, and contain him consistent with the 
requirements of the Bail Act would cause him to somehow "bear a special disadvantage." Release 
Motion at 12 n.9. Indeed: "What more compelling case for an order of detention is there than a 
case in which only an armed guard and the threat of deadly force is sufficient to assure the 
defendant's appearance?' Zarrab, 2016 WL 3681432, at *12 (quoting United States v. Valerio, 9 
F. Supp. 3d at 295). 
III. 
The Defendant Provides No Assurance He is Not a Danger to the Community and a 
Risk to Obstruct Justice 
A. Danger to the Community 
In the first instance, the defendant's argument that 14 years without a criminal conviction 
eliminates "any danger presumption" should be rejected. Were that the case—which is certainly 
is not—a lack of criminal record for any defendant would automatically rebut the presumption 
applicable to crimes such as sex trafficking. That is manifestly incorrect. See United States v. 
Antis, 607 F. App'x 95, 97 (2d Cir. 2015) (finding that a defendant's lack of criminal record was 
"not so compelling as to defeat the presumption or to manifest clear error in the district court's 
determination that no combination of release conditions . . . could reasonably assure against 
dangerousness and the risk of flight"). Moreover, here, the defendant not only has a criminal 
record, but has been convicted of a sex crime involving a minor. 
But the ongoing and forward-looking danger posed by the defendant is further 
demonstrated by the defendant's maintenance of a substantial collection of photographic trophies 
of his victims and other young females in his mansion, as discovered by the Government through 
its search warrants. As indicated in the Detention Memo, the many discs found in the defendant's 
residence included those with hand-written labels including the following: "Young [Name] + 
[Name]," "Misc nudes I," and "Girl pies nude." Not surprisingly, the Government has found that 
such discs contain photographs of sexually suggestive photographs of fully- or partially-nude 
females appearing to be underage.

Page 11 
B. Danger to Obstruct Justice 
The defendant has also already demonstrated a willingness to use intimidation and 
aggressive tactics in connection with a criminal investigation. Far from being "musty," Release 
Motion at 6 n.6, the defendant's past behavior in connection with being investigated for sexually 
abusing children is the best predictor of his likely incentives and activities in connection with being 
charged with sexually abusing children. For example, in the incident the defendant now claims 
was not attributable to or authorized by him, the contemporaneous police report indicates that 
pressure tactics were at the vet), least coordinated closely with individuals in the defendant's orbit. 
See Palm Beach Police Report (the "Police Report") (Ex. B). According to the Police Report, the 
parent of one of the defendant's victims was driven off the road by a private investigator. The 
Police Report provides further information regarding victim and witness threats and intimidation 
reported against an individual who was directly in contact with an assistant of the defendant, 
followed "immediately" by a call to that same individual from a phone number associated with the 
defendant's businesses and associates. 
Separately, and in addition, there are also extensive allegations of obstruction and 
tampering in connection with civil lawsuits brought against the defendant following his 2008 
conviction. See Doe v. United States, 08 Civ. 80736 (S.D. Fla.), Dkt. 291-15 at 21-23, 31. 
Moreover, police reports suggest that an associate of Epstein's was offering to buy victims' silence 
during the course of the prior investigation. Specifically, one victim reported that "she was 
personally contacted through a source that has maintained contact with Epstein," who "assured 
[the victim] that she would receive monetary compensation for her assistance in not cooperating 
with law enforcement." Indeed, the victim reported having been told: "Those who help him will 
be compensated and those who hurt him will be dealt with." See Palm Beach Police Report 
(Ex. C). 
And Epstein's efforts to influence witnesses continue to this day. As in the past, within 
recent months. he paid significant amounts of money to influence individuals who were close to 
him during the time period charged in this case and who might be witnesses against him at a trial. 
By way of background, on or about November 28, 2018, the Miami Herald began publishing a 
series of articles relating to the defendant, his conduct, and the circumstances of his prior 
conviction and the non-prosecution agreement ("NPA"). Records obtained by the Government 
from Institution-1 appear to show that just two days later, on or about November 30, 2018, the 
defendant wired $100,000 from a trust account he controlled to an individual named as a possible 
co-conspirator in the NPA. The same records appear to show that just three days after that, on or 
about December 3, 2018, the defendant wired $250,000 from the same trust account to another 
individual named as a possible co-conspirator in the NPA and also identified as one of the 
defendant's employees in the Indictment. Neither of these payments appears to be recurring or 
repeating during the approximately five years of bank records presently available to the 
Government. This course of action, and in particular its timing, suggests the defendant was 
attempting to further influence co-conspirators who might provide information against him in light 
of the recently re-emerging allegations

IV. 
The Defendant Raises Legal Arguments Not Relevant Here 
Finally, the defendant raises certain legal arguments he contends he will litigate at the 
appropriate stage and which he further suggests mitigate in favor of bail. None is meritorious, and 
certainly none should give the Court any comfort whatsoever that the defendant would, if granted 
bail, refrain from fleeing so he could attempt to vindicate himself via dubious legal strategies. 
Nevertheless, the Government will address the defendant's arguments briefly in turn. 
A. The Non-Prosecution Agreement Does Not Preclude Prosecution 
As an initial matter, as the Court itself noted at the parties' initial appearance earlier this 
week, and as the defendant appears to concede, the instant Indictment charges conduct well beyond 
the scope of the NPA — that is, alleged conduct that occurred here in New York and involving New 
York based victims. D. Tr. 6-8; Release Motion at 2. For present purposes, that alone is sufficient 
to put this issue to rest, because even assuming the defendant were to mount a meritorious 
challenge to the NPA, he would still have to stand trial on Count Two of the Indictment and 
additional charges brought based on New York conduct. 
But more generally, the reasons the defendant can be prosecuted in the Southern District 
of New York—or anywhere else outside the SDFL—are manifold. The language of the NPA 
overwhelmingly refers to the SDFL, and the core terms and text of the agreement are limited to 
the SDFL. The prefatory language states: "THEREFORE, on the authority of R. Alexander 
Acosta, United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, prosecution in this District for 
these offenses shall be deferred in favor of prosecution by the State of Florida."' The final 
paragraph of the prefatory language also states, among other things, that after fulfilling the terms 
of the agreement, "no prosecution for the [sex abuse] offenses set out on pages 1 and 2 of this 
Agreement, nor any other offenses that have been the subject of the joint investigation by the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States Attorney's Office, nor any offenses that 
arose from the Federal Grand Jury investigation will be instituted in this District." 
In its terms section, the NPA further states that Epstein's signature "is not to be construed 
as an admission of civil or criminal liability or a waiver of any jurisdictional or other defense" as 
to any victim whose identity was not disclosed by SDFL to Epstein, as provided for in the NPA, 
and additionally states that neither Epstein's signature nor any resulting waivers or civil 
settlements "are to be construed as admissions or evidence of civil or criminal liability or a waiver 
of any jurisdictional or other defense as to any person." These provisions show the parties 
contemplated possible criminal prosecutions in other jurisdictions and/or based on victims not 
initially identified in the Florida investigations (whether in Florida or elsewhere). The final 
substantive paragraph of the NPA states that "Epstein hereby requests that the United States 
Attorney for the Southern District of Florida defer [...] prosecution." 
It is well settled in the Second Circuit that "a plea agreement in one U.S. Attorney's office 
does not, unless otherwise stated, bind another." United States v. Prisco, 391 F. App'x 920, 921 
All emphases relating to the NPA are added unless otherwise specified.

Page 13 
(2d Cir. 2010) ("A plea agreement binds only the office of the United States Attorney for the 
district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates 
a broader restriction.") (citing United States v. Annabi, 771 F.2d 670, 672 (2d Cir. 1985) (per 
curiam)). Moreover, any references in an NPA to the "Government" or the "United States" do not 
abrogate these principles. Annabi, 771 F.2d at 672 ("[A] plea agreement whereby a federal 
prosecutor agrees that 'the Government' will dismiss counts of an indictment ... might be thought 
to bar the United States from reprosecuting the dismissed charges in any judicial district unless the 
agreement expressly limits the scope of the agreement .. . . However, the law has evolved to the 
contrary."). "The mere use of the term 'government' in the plea agreement does not create an 
affirmative appearance that the agreement contemplated barring districts other than the particular 
district entering into the agreement." United States v. Salameh, 152 F.3d 88, 120 (2d Cir. 1998) 
(citations and internal quotation marks omitted); see also United States v. Brown, No. 99-1230, 
2002 WL 34244994, at *2 (2d Cir. Apr. 26, 2002) (in analyzing an SDFL plea agreement, 
reiterating the holding of Annabi and noting that it applies "even if the plea agreement purports to 
bind 'the Government' or the "United States") (summary order); United States v. Bruno, 159 F. 
Supp. 3d 311, 321 (E.D.N.Y. 2016) ("The Court disagrees with Defendant's argument that the 
phrase 'United States' shows an intent to bind all United States Attorney's Offices. Rather, the 
plea agreement covers only Defendant's liability in the SDFL."). 
In sum, this issue is a distraction that has little relevance to the bail determination and does 
nothing to address the defendant's risk of flight or mitigate the danger he poses to the community. 
B. The Defendant Wrongly Argues the Statute Does Not Apply to His Sex Trafficking 
Next, the defendant wrongly argues that the "principal conduct" giving rise to the charges 
is his payment of underage girls for sex acts, and that such conduct could not possibly fall under 
the charged statutes. As the defendant implicitly concedes, Release Motion at 14, this is an issue 
for a motion to dismiss. Nevertheless, the defendant's argument is incorrect for two reasons. 
First, although the defendant undoubtedly participated on the demand side of the crime, he 
was also instrumental on the supply side given his role in recruiting and causing others to recruit 
additional victims. He organized, funded, and perpetuated a sex trafficking scheme in two states, 
including with co-conspirators. The fact that he did so for his own eventual and frequent sexual 
gratification does not vitiate his role in enticing and recruiting victims, consistent with the elements 
of the offense with which he is charged. The defendant was the leader of a sex-trafficking 
enterprise, not a mere consumer. 
g This analysis similarly extends to a non-prosecution agreement. See United States v. Laskow, 
688 F. Supp. 851, 854 (E.D.N.Y. 1988) ("Defendant's argument, in effect, is that unless there is 
an explicit statement to the contrary, it is presumed that a non-prosecution agreement binds offices 
of the United States Attorney that are not parties to the agreement. This position is at odds with 
the law in this Circuit, which presumes a narrow reading of the boundaries of a plea agreement 
unless a defendant can affirmatively establish that a more expansive interpretation was 
contemplated.") (citing Annabi, 771 F.2d at 672).

Second, he is also wrong on the law. Courts have found that Section 1591 applied to both 
suppliers and consumers of commercial sex acts. See, e.g., United States v. fingers, 702 F.3d 
1066, 1069 (8th Cir. 2013) (upholding the conviction of a defendant who attempted to pay for oral 
sex from an underage girl and explaining: "The sole issue raised on appeal is whether '[t]he plain 
and unambiguous provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 1591 apply to both suppliers and consumers of 
commercial sex acts.' We conclude they do.") (alteration in original). The lone case cited by the 
defendant, Flom v. Taylor, No. 11 Civ. 8573, 2012 WL 13042630 (S.D.N.Y. July 2, 2012), relied 
heavily on the statutory interpretation undertaken by two district courts in the District of South 
Dakota, United States v. Bonestroo, No. 11 Cr. 40016, 2012 WL 13704 (D.S.D. Jan. 4, 2012), and 
United States v. Jungers, 11 Cr. 40018, 2011 WL 6046495 (D.S.D. Dec. 5, 2011), both of which 
were explicitly overruled by the Eighth Circuit decision in Jungers, 702 F.3d 1066. In the seven 
years since Fierro has been decided, it does not appear to have been cited by a single other court. 
Additionally, other cases in this Circuit and elsewhere have upheld convictions of procurers or 
customers. See United States v. O'Connor, 650 F.3d 839 (2d Cir. 2011) (upholding convictions 
under Section 1591 of both the buyer and seller of a child); United States v. Cook, 782 F.3d 983 
(8th Cir. 2015) (rejecting a constitutional challenge that Section 1591 would be void for vagueness 
if applied to purchasers); United States v. Mikoloyck, No. 09 Cr. 036, 2009 WL 4798900 (W.D. 
Mo. Dec. 7, 2009) ("contrary to defendant's argument, 18 U.S.C. § 1591 clearly applies to those 
who attempt to purchase underage sex, not merely the pimps of actual exploited children") (citing 
United States v. Roberts, 174 F. App's 475 (11th Cir. 2006) (in which defendant was convicted 
under sections 1591(a) and 1594(a) even though no actual children were involved)). 
CONCLUSION 
As set forth above, the defendant's proposed bail package is insufficient and insubstantial. 
Pretrial Services, victims, and the Government all recommend pretrial detention due to the unusual 
and concerning confluence of factors in this case, including the defendant's extraordinary wealth, 
demonstrated willingness to interfere with victims and witnesses, continued possession of lewd 
photographs of young females, and both the incentive and means to flee prosecution.

Re: 
United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 (RMB) 
Dear Judge Pitman: 
The Government respectfully submits this letter in advance of the bail hearing scheduled 
for July 8, 2019, in the above-captioned case. For the reasons set forth herein, the Court should 
order that the defendant be detained pending trial; he cannot meet his burden of overcoming the 
presumption that there is no combination of conditions that would reasonably assure his continued 
appearance in this case or protect the safety of the community were he to be released. 
As set forth below, the charges in this case are exceptionally serious: the defendant is 
alleged to be a serial sexual predator who preyed on dozens of minor girls over a period of years, 
and he now faces a potentially massive prison sentence predicated on substantial and multifaceted 
evidence of his guilt. In light of the strength of the Government's evidence and the substantial 
incarceratory term the defendant would face upon conviction, there is an extraordinary risk of 
flight, particularly given the defendant's exorbitant wealth, his ownership of and access to private 
planes capable of international travel, and his significant international ties. Indeed, the arrest of 
the defendant occurred when he arrived in the United States on his private jet after having returned 
from a multi-week stay abroad. 
Finally, and as detailed herein, the Government has real concerns—grounded in past 
experience with this defendant—that if allowed to remain out on bail, the defendant could attempt 
to pressure and intimidate witnesses and potential witnesses in this case, including victims and 
their families, and otherwise attempt to obstruct justice. As a result, he poses both an acute danger 
to the community, including some of its most vulnerable members, and a significant risk of flight. 
The defendant thus cannot overcome the statutory presumption that detention is appropriate in this 
case, and the Court should order that he be detained pending trial.

BACKGROUND 
A. Overview 
On July 2, 2019, a federal grand jury in the Southern District of New York returned a sealed 
indictment (the "Indictment") charging the defendant with one count of sex trafficking of minors, 
in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591, and one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors, 
in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371. 
As charged by the grand jury, the facts underlying the charges in the Indictment arise from 
a years-long scheme to sexually abuse underage girls. In particular, beginning in at least 2002, the 
defendant enticed and recruited dozens of minor girls to engage in sex acts with him, for which he 
paid the victims hundreds of dollars in cash. 
He undertook this activity in at least two different locations, including his mansion in 
Manhattan, New York (the "New York Residence") and his estate in Palm Beach, Florida (the 
"Palm Beach Residence"). In both New York and Florida, the defendant perpetuated this abuse in 
similar ways. Victims were initially recruited to provide "massages" to the defendant, which 
would be performed nude or partially nude, would become increasingly sexual in nature, and 
would typically include one or more sex acts, including groping and direct or indirect contact with 
victims' genitals. The defendant paid his victims hundreds of dollars in cash for each separate 
encounter. 
Moreover, the defendant actively encouraged certain of his victims to recruit additional 
girls to be similarly sexually abused. He incentivized his victims to become recruiters by paying 
these victim-recruiters hundreds of dollars for each additional girl they brought to him. In this 
fashion, the defendant created a vast network of underage victims for him to exploit, in locations 
including New York and Palm Beach. 
The defendant's victims were as young as 14 years old when he abused them. Many of his 
victims were, for various reasons, often particularly vulnerable to exploitation. The defendant 
intentionally sought out—and knew that he was abusing—minors. Indeed, in some instances, his 
victims expressly told him they were underage before or during the period in which he abused 
them. 
In creating and maintaining a network of minor victims whom he abused, the defendant 
worked with others, including employees and associates who facilitated his exploitation of minors 
by, among other things, contacting victims and scheduling their sexual encounters with the 
defendant, both in New York and in Florida. 
B. The Defendant 
Jeffrey Epstein designed, financed, and perpetrated this scheme, both as its main participant 
and through his direction of others, including certain of his employees, to further facilitate his 
rampant abuse of underage girls.

Page 3 
As has been widely reported, the defendant is extraordinarily wealthy, and he owns and 
maintains luxury properties and residences around the world, including in Manhattan, New York; 
Palm Beach, Florida; Stanley, New Mexico; and Paris, France. Additionally, Epstein owns a 
private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands which, as noted above, is believed to be his primary 
residence in the United States. His mansion in Manhattan alone—a multi-story townhouse 
reported to be one of the largest single residences in all of Manhattan, which previously housed a 
school and which he owns through an LLC—has been valued at approximately $77 million. 
Entities controlled by the defendant also own at least two private jets in active service, at least one 
of which is capable of intercontinental travel. 
As described further below, the defendant possesses three active United States passports, 
and his international connections and travels are extensive. 
For example, in addition to 
maintaining a residence in Paris, France, as described above, in the past 18 months alone, the 
defendant has traveled abroad, via private jet, either into or out of the country on approximately 
more than 20 occasions. 
C. The Prior Florida Investigation 
In or about 2005, the defendant was investigated by local police in Palm Beach, Florida, in 
connection with allegations that he had committed similar sex offenses against minor girls. The 
investigation ultimately also involved federal authorities, namely the U.S. Attorney's Office for 
the Southern District of Florida ("SDFL") and the FBI's Miami Office, and included interviews 
with victims based in the Palm Beach area, including some of the alleged victims relevant to Count 
One of the instant Indictment.' 
In fall 2007, the defendant entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the SDFL in 
connection with the conduct at issue in that investigation, which the non-prosecution agreement 
identified as including investigations into the defendant's abuse of minor girls in the Palm Beach 
area. The Southern District of New York was not a signatory to that agreement, and the defendant 
was never charged federally.2 In June 2008, the defendant pled guilty in state court to one count 
of procuring a person under the age of 18 for prostitution, a felony, and one count of solicitation 
of prostitution, a felony. As a result, the defendant was designated as a sex offender with 
registration requirements under the national Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act. 
' The non-prosecution agreement, further discussed below, was entered into at the conclusion of 
the SDFL investigation and did not purport to cover any victims outside of the State of Florida. 
As noted above, the instant Indictment expressly alleges the existence of dozens of victims who 
were abused in this District in addition to dozens of victims who were abused in Florida. 
While beyond the scope of a bail hearing, as discussed further below, it is well-established in the 
Second Circuit that absent an express provision to the contrary in the agreement, one District is 
not bound by the terms of an agreement entered into between a defendant and a U.S. Attorney's 
Office in another district. See page 6, infra.

ARGUMENT 
I. 
Applicable Law 
Under the Bail Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. §§ 3141 et seq., federal courts are empowered to 
order a defendant's detention pending trial upon a determination that the defendant is either a 
danger to the community or a risk of flight. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e) ("no condition or combination of 
conditions would reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any 
other person and the community"). 
A finding of risk of flight must be supported by a 
preponderance of the evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 5 (2d Cir. 1987); 
United States v. Chirnurenga, 760 F.2d 400, 405 (2d Cir. 1985). A finding of dangerousness must 
be supported by clear and convincing evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Ferranti, 66 F.3d 540, 
542 (2d Cir. 1995); Chirnurenga, 760 F.2d at 405. In addition, a court may also order detention if 
there is "a serious risk that the [defendant] will . . . attempt to obstruct justice, or . . . to threaten, 
injure, or intimidate, a prospective witness or juror." 18 U.S.C. § 3142(0(2)(B); see also United 
States v. Friedman, 837 F.2d 48 (2d Cir. 1988). 
The Bail Reform Act lists four factors to be considered in the detention analysis: (1) the 
nature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person; 
(3) the history and characteristics of the defendant, including the person's "character . . . [and] 
financial resources"; and (4) the seriousness of the danger posed by the defendant's release. See 
U.S.C. § 3142(g). Evidentiary rules do not apply at detention hearings and the government is 
entitled to present evidence by way of proffer, among other means. See 18 U.S.C. § 3142(0(2); 
see also United States v. LaFontaine, 210 F.3d 125, 130-31 (2d Cir. 2000) (government entitled 
to proceed by proffer in detention hearings); Ferranti, 66 F.3d at 542 (same); United States v. 
Martir, 782 F.2d 1141, 1145 (2d Cir. 1986) (same). 
Where a judicial officer concludes after a hearing that "no condition or combination of 
conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any 
other person and the community, such judicial officer shall order the detention of the person before 
trial." 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(1). Additionally, where, as here, a defendant is charged with 
committing an offense involving a minor victim under 18 U.S.C. § 1591, it shall be presumed, 
subject to rebuttal, that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the 
appearance of the defendant as required and the safety of the community. 
U.S.C. 
§ 3142(e)(3)(E). 
II. 
Discussion 
The defendant should be detained pending trial. For the reasons set forth below, it is 
difficult to overstate the risk of flight and danger to the community if the defendant is released, 
and for those reasons, the defendant cannot overcome the statutory presumption in favor of 
detention in this case.

Page 5 
A. The Defendant Poses an Extreme Flight Risk 
Each of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk — the nature and circumstances 
of the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant —
counsel strongly in favor of detention. 
I. The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense and the Strength of the Evidence 
The "nature and circumstances" of this offense plainly favor detention. 18 U.S.C. 
§ 3I42(g)( I ) (specifically enumerating "whether the offense. . . involves a minor victim" as a 
factor in bail applications). Indeed, the crime of sex trafficking of a minor is so serious that for a 
defendant charged with that offense, there is a presumption that no condition or combination of 
conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as required and the safety of the 
community. 18 U.S.C. § 3142 (e)(3)(E). Here, as specified in the Indictment, the defendant's 
conduct was committed serially, over a period of years, and affected dozens of victims. 
The seriousness of the charge is also reflected in the penalties the defendant faces, which 
include up to 45 years of incarceration for Counts One and Two of the Indictment.' As the Second 
Circuit has noted, the possibility of a severe sentence is a significant factor in assessing the risk of 
flight. See Jackson, 823 F.2d at 7; see also United States v. Cisneros, 328 F.3d 610, 618 (10th Cir. 
2003) (defendant was a flight risk because her knowledge of the seriousness of the charges against her 
gave her a strong incentive to abscond); United States v. Townsend, 897 F.2d 989, 995 (9th Cir. 1990) 
("Facing the much graver penalties possible under the present indictment, the defendants have an even 
greater incentive to consider flight."). Here, the defendant is facing a statutory maximum of decades 
in prison. Even in the absence of means—which, as discussed in detail below, the defendant has 
in abundance—this fact alone would provide a compelling incentive for anyone to fail to appear. 
It is particularly compelling for a defendant who is 66 years old and therefore faces the very real 
prospect of spending the rest of his life in prison if convicted. 
The likelihood of a substantial period of incarceration is buttressed by the strength of the 
evidence. As set forth in the Indictment, the evidence in this case is strong. The Indictment alleges 
that the defendant sexually abused dozens of minor victims, and the conspiracy count lists 
numerous overt acts committed in furtherance of the defendant's crimes.' 
The current penalties for violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1591 include a 10 year mandatory minimum 
sentence. However, that punishment was created through an amendment to the statute in 2006. 
The penalty for a violation of Section 1591 during the period charged in the Indictment, and 
therefore relevant here, was a maximum of 40 years' imprisonment. 
With respect to the evidence in this case, the Court should start its analysis by accepting that the 
Indictment is sufficient, on its own, to establish probable cause that the defendant committed the 
crimes of sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy. Contreras, 776 F.2d at 54. ("Were an 
evidentiary hearing addressing the existence of probable cause required in every § 3142(e) case in 
which an indictment had been filed, the court would spend scarce judicial resources considering 
that which a grand jury had already determined, and have less time to focus on the application of

Honorable Henry Pitman 
United States Magistrate Judge 
July 8, 2019 
Page 6 
Multiple victims, including several specified in the Indictment, have provided information 
against the defendant. That information is detailed, credible, and corroborated, in many instances, 
by other witnesses and contemporaneous documents, records and other evidence—including, as 
further detailed below, evidence from a search of the New York Residence on the night of the 
defendant's arrest that reflects an extraordinary volume of photographs of nude and partially-nude 
young women or girls. Such corroborating evidence also includes documents and other materials, 
such as contemporaneous notes, messages recovered from the defendant's residence that include 
names and contact information for certain victims, and call records that confirm the defendant and 
his agents were repeatedly in contact with various victims during the charged period. Put simply, 
all of this evidence — the voluminous and credible testimony of individuals who were sexually 
abused by the defendant as minors, each of whom are backed up by other evidence — will be 
devastating evidence of guilt at any trial in this case and weighs heavily in favor of detention. 
Finally, it bears noting that neither the age of the conduct nor the defendant's previous non-
prosecution agreement ("NPA") with a different federal district pose any impediment to his 
conviction. As an initial matter, all of the conduct is timely charged, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3283, 
which was amended in 2003 to extend the limitations period for conduct that was timely as of the 
date of the amendment, to any time during the lifetime of the minor victim. See United States v. 
Chief 438 F.3d 920, 922-25 (9th Cir. 2006) (finding that because Congress extended the statute 
of limitations for sex offenses involving minors during the time the previous statute was still 
running, the extension was permissible); United States v. Pierre-Louis, No. 16 Cr. 541 (CM), 2018 
WL 4043140, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2018) (same). 
Moreover, with respect to the NPA, that agreement, to which the Southern District of New 
York was not a party, which by its express language pertained exclusively to the SDFL 
investigation, and which did not purport to bind any other Office or District, does not preclude 
prosecution in this District for at least two reasons. First, it is well settled in the Second Circuit 
that "a plea agreement in one U.S. Attorney's office does not, unless otherwise stated, bind 
another." United States v. Frisco, 391 F. App'x 920, 921 (2d Cir. 2010) ("A plea agreement binds 
only the office of the United States Attorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it 
affirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.") (citing United States 
v. Annabi, 771 F.2d 670, 672 (2d Cir. 1985) (per curiam)). This is true even if the text of the 
agreement purports to bind "the Government." See Annabi, 771 F.2d at 672. This analysis 
similarly extends to a non-prosecution agreement. See United States v. Laskow, 688 F. Supp. 851, 
854 (E.D.N.Y. 1988) ("Defendant's argument, in effect, is that unless there is an explicit statement 
to the contrary, it is presumed that a non-prosecution agreement binds offices of the United States 
Attorney that are not parties to the agreement. This position is at odds with the law in this Circuit, 
which presumes a narrow reading of the boundaries of a plea agreement unless a defendant can 
affirmatively establish that a more expansive interpretation was contemplated.") (citing Annabi, 
771 F.2d at 672). Second, the Indictment charges conduct not covered by the NPA, namely 
the presumptions and the § 3142(g) factors in deciding whether the defendant should be 
detained.").

conduct that occurred in New York. The prior NPA included a list of several dozen victims 
identified in the prior investigation, all of whom were abused in the State of Florida, and none of 
whom are a part of the conduct charged in Count Two of the instant Indictment. 
Each of these factors—the seriousness of the allegations, the strength of the evidence, and 
the possibility of lengthy incarceration—creates an extraordinary incentive to flee. And as further 
described below, the defendant has the means and money to do so. 
2. The Characteristics of the Defendant 
The history and characteristics of the defendant also strongly support detention. The 
defendant is extraordinarily wealthy and has access to vast financial resources to fund any attempt 
to flee. Indeed, his potential avenues of flight from justice are practically limitless. 
As the defendant acknowledged in his most recent New York State sex offender 
registration, he has six residences, including two in the U.S. Virgin Islands (including his own 
private island), and one each in Palm Beach, Florida; Paris, France; New York, New York; and 
Stanley, New Mexico. The most recent estimated value of the defendant's New York City mansion 
alone is more than $77 million. The most recent tax-assessed value of the defendant's Palm Beach 
estate is more than $12 million. The defendant's primary residence is a private island in the U.S. 
Virgin Islands, a place where any sort of meaningful supervision would be all but impossible. 
Moreover, the defendant has access to innumerable means to flee. His sex registration 
documentation of "current vehicles" lists no fewer than 15 motor vehicles, including seven 
Chevrolet Suburbans, a cargo van, a Range Rover, a Mercedez-Benz sedan, a Cadillac Escalade, 
and a Hummer II. These cars are registered in various states and territories including the Virgin 
Islands, New York, Florida, and New Mexico. The defendant also has access to two private jets, 
giving him the ability to leave the country secretly and on a moment's notice and to go virtually 
anywhere he wants to travel. He is a very frequent international traveler and regularly travels to 
and from the United States by private plane. In particular, between January 1, 2018, and the 
present, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol has logged approximately more than 20 flights in which 
Epstein was traveling to or from a foreign country. Indeed, he was arrested at Teterboro Airport 
arriving on just such a private international flight after having spent approximately three weeks 
abroad. Extensive international travel of this nature further demonstrates a significant risk of 
flight. See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp. 2d 32, 36 (D.D.C. 2005). There can be 
no assurance that, upon release, the defendant would suddenly lack access to such means of travel. 
Finally, the defendant has no meaningful ties that would keep him in this country. The 
defendant has no known immediate family. He is not married and has no children. He has friends 
and associates worldwide, as demonstrated by his extensive international travel, and his 
professional obligations, if any, can and seemingly are plainly capable of being handled by the 
defendant remotely. Simply put, there would be no meaningful reason for the defendant to remain 
in the country, while he would have every incentive (and every resource needed) to flee. 
Nor would home confinement with electronic monitoring reasonably assure the 
defendant's presence as required. At best, home confinement with electronic monitoring would

Page 8 
merely reduce his head start should he decide to flee. See United States v. Zarger, No. 00 Cr. 773, 
2000 WL 1134364, at *1 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2000) (Gleeson, J.) (rejecting defendant's application 
for bail in part because home detention with electronic monitoring "at best . . limits a fleeing 
defendant's head start"); see also United States v. Casteneda, No. 18 Cr. 047, 2018 WL 888744, 
at *9 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 2018) (same); United States v. Anderson, 384 F.Supp.2d 32, 41 (D.D.C. 
2005) (same); United States v. Benatar, No. 02 Cr. 099, 2002 WL 31410262, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. 
Oct. 10, 2002) (same). 
Finally, there can be little doubt that the defendant is in a position to abandon millions of 
dollars in cash and property securing any potential bond and still live comfortably for the rest of 
his life. These resources, and the ease with which the defendant could flee and live outside the 
reach of law enforcement—particularly considering his vast wealth and lack of meaningful ties to 
this District—make the risk of flight exceptionally high in this case, particularly when considered 
in conjunction with the strength of the government's case and the lengthy sentence the defendant 
could receive if convicted. 
B. The Defendant Poses a Risk of Danger to the Community and of Engaging in 
Obstruction of Justice 
The release of the defendant, under any conditions, would pose a significant threat to the 
community and to the ongoing investigation. 
As described above, where there is probable cause to believe that an individual has 
committed an offense under 18 U.S.C. § 1591, it is presumed that no condition or combination of 
conditions can reasonably assure the safety of the community. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(3). Here, not 
only is the defendant charged with very serious sex crimes against minors, he has already 
previously admitted to—and been convicted of—engaging in related conduct. Specifically, in 
June 2008, the defendant pled guilty in state court to one count of procuring a person under the 
age of 18 for prostitution, a felony, and he currently is a registered sex offender, under 
classification level three in New York—defined as presenting a "high" risk of committing another 
sex crime and harm to the community. While the conduct presently alleged does not post-date the 
2008 conviction, it nevertheless underscores the risk he poses to the community if released. 
Additionally, and in connection with the investigation of the defendant's offense in Florida, 
there were credible allegations that the defendant engaged in witness tampering, harassment, or 
other obstructive behaviors. In fact, according to publicly-filed court documents, there were 
discussions between prosecutors and the defendant's then-counsel about the possibility of the 
defendant pleading guilty to counts relating to "obstruction," as well as "harassment," with 
reference to 18 U.S.C. § 1512, which criminalizes "[t]ampering with a witness, victim, or 
informant." For example, in a communication from the defendant's then-counsel to prosecutors 
in SDFL, his counsel set forth a possible factual proffer that included statements that the defendant 
had "attempted to harass both [redacted] delay and hinder their receipt of a [redacted] to attend an 
official proceeding" and that the defendant "in particular, changed travel plans and flew with both 
[redacted] to the United States Virgin Islands rather than to an airport in New Jersey in order to 
attempt to delay their receipt of what Mr. Epstein expected to be a [redacted]" and "further verbally

Page 9 
harassed both [redacted] in connection to this attempt to delay their voluntary receipt of process 
all in violation of 18 USC 1512(d)(1)."5 Doe v. United States, 08 Civ. 80736 (S.D. Fla.), Dkts. 
361 at 3-4, 361-7 through 361-11. In addition to 18 U.S.C. § 1512(d), prosecutors also proposed 
that the defendant could plead guilty to 18 U.S.C. § 403, that is, a knowing or intentional violation 
of the privacy protection of child victims and child witnesses, to which the defendant's then-
counsel replied: "Already thinking about the same statutes." Id. Dkt. 361-11. They also discussed 
a possible obstruction plea that "could rely on the incident where Mr. Epstein's private 
investigators followed [redacted] father, forcing off the road." Id. Dkt. 361-10. 
The defendant's apparent previous willingness to obstruct a federal investigation, harass or 
tamper with witnesses, and hire private investigators that "forc[edf off the road" the father of an 
individual relevant in the investigation is alarming. It should especially weigh on the Court's 
consideration here because the defendant was apparently willing to take those steps before even 
being charged and thus facing federal indictment; the incentive to interfere in the Government's 
case here, where an Indictment has been returned, is exponentially greater. And as discussed 
above, the defendant has nearly limitless means to do so. 
Finally, despite having been previously convicted of a sex offense involving an underage 
victim, the defendant has continued to maintain a vast trove of lewd photographs of young-looking 
women or girls in his Manhattan mansion. In a search of the New York Residence on the night of 
his arrest, on July 6-7, 2019, pursuant to judicially-authorized warrants, law enforcement officers 
discovered not only specific evidence consistent with victim recollections of the inside of the 
mansion, further strengthening the evidence of the conduct charged in the Indictment, but also at 
least hundreds—and perhaps thousands-of sexually suggestive photographs of fully- or partially-
nude females. While these items were only seized this weekend and are still being reviewed, some 
of the nude or partially-nude photographs appear to be of underage girls, including at least one girl 
who, according to her counsel, was underage at the time the relevant photographs were taken. 
Additionally, some of the photographs referenced herein were discovered in a locked safe, in which 
law enforcement officers also found compact discs with hand-written labels including the 
following: "Young [Name] + [Name]," "Misc nudes 1," and "Girl pics nude." The defendant, a 
registered sex offender, is not reformed, he is not chastened, he is not repentwe rather, he is a 
continuing danger to the community and an individual who faces devastating evidence supporting 
deeply serious charges. 
The redactions above are contained in the publicly filed version of the quoted document. 
See, e.g., Amber Southerland, Billionaire Jef•ey Epstein: I'm a sex offender, not a predator, 
N.Y. Post (2011) ("I'm not a sexual predator, I'm an "offender," the financier told The Post 
yesterday. `It's the difference between a murderer and a person who steals a bagel.'"); Philip 
Weiss, The Fantasist, New York Magazine (2007) ("`It's the Icarus story, someone who flies too 
close to the sun,' I said. `Did Icarus like massages?' Epstein asked.").

Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document 11-1 Filed 07/12/19 Page 10 of 10 
Honorable Henry Pitman 
United States Magistrate Judge 
July 8, 2019 
Page 10 
CONCLUSION 
As set forth above, in this case, the risk of flight in this case is extraordinarily real. The 
defendant is extremely wealthy, has extensive foreign contacts, and is charged with serious 
offenses that carry a potential statutory sentence of up to 45 years' imprisonment—even a fraction 
of which could result in the defendant, who is 66 years old, spending the rest of his life in jail. In 
sum, the defendant's transient lifestyle, his lack of family or community ties, his extensive 
international travel and ties outside the country, and his vast wealth, including his access to and 
ownership of private planes, all provide the defendant with the motive and means to become a 
successful fugitive. Further, the nature of the offenses he is alleged to have perpetrated—the abuse 
dozens of underage, vulnerable girls—along with his demonstrated willingness to harass, 
intimidate and otherwise tamper with victims and other potential witnesses against him, render his 
dangerousness readily apparent. 
Accordingly, the Government respectfully submits that the defendant cannot and will not 
be able to meet his burden of overcoming the strong presumption in favor of detention, that there 
are no conditions of bail that would assure the defendant's presence in court proceedings in this 
case or protect the safety of the community, and that any application for bail should be denied.

Hey 
I am drafting our response to Epstein's claim that the victims cannot obtain "rescission" as a remedy. Because my clients 
would like to avoid interfering with your efforts in any way, would you like to see our draft before it is filed? 
In particular, our brief begins with a section arguing that: 
THIS CASE MUST BE DECIDED ON THE AGREED PREMISE THAT THE NPA ONLY COVERS THE U.S. ATTORNEY'S 
OFFICE FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA. 
It occurs to me it might be useful for your Office to review that section before we file. We file in about one week.

Hey PCU — As you likely may have seen/heard at this point, last evening, we arrested Jeffrey Epstein on sex trafficking 
charges. Epstein is in custody and will be presented and arraigned on an Indictment that will be unsealed tomorrow 
morning. 
The case is an incredibly important one — not only is the conduct extremely serious and deeply disturbing — but our 
charges ensure that dozens if not more of Epstein's victims, girls who were as young as 14 at the time they were abused, 
will finally have their day in court. It is an extraordinarily worthy prosecution and just the latest example of how this unit 
will never shy away from bringing tough cases against powerful people who have committed grievous crimes. 
Please join me and 
in extending a very well-deserved congratulations to the team, 
who 
have worked tirelessly to make this case happen (and happen so quickly). They have done us all proud, and if you are 
free, we hope you join us for the press conference formally announcing the charges, which should happen Monday 
morning at 11.

Again in connection with the Epstein investigation, we'd like to please request permission to travel for approximately 
three days next week for meetings and interviews in West Palm Beach, Florida. As of now we tentatively expect to fly 
down Tuesday night and return on Wednesday or Thursday (and will keep the timeframe as short as scheduling allows). 
Unfortunately we're still trying to pin down timing for interviewing the victims, so depending on the timing it will either 
be me and 
or 
and 
but we wanted to ask for permission now either way so we weren't doing it 
super last minute after the holiday on Tuesday. And also same as last time, we'd like to ask permission to reserve a 
conference room at the hotel for the interviews, please. 
thanks very much,

Hey PCU —As you likely may have seen/heard at this point, last evening, we arrested Jeffrey Epstein on sex trafficking 
charges. Epstein is in custody and will be presented and arraigned on an Indictment that will be unsealed tomorrow 
morning. 
The case is an incredibly important one — not only is the conduct extremely serious and deeply disturbing — but our 
charges ensure that dozens if not more of Epstein's victims, girls who were as young as 14 at the time they were abused, 
will finally have their day in court. It is an extraordinarily worthy prosecution and just the latest example of how this 
unit will never shy away from bringing tough cases against powerful people who have committed grievous crimes. 
Please join me and 
in extending a very well-deserved congratulations to the team, 
who have worked tirelessly to make this case happen (and happen so quickly). They have done us all proud, and if you 
are free, we hope you join us for the press conference formally announcing the charges, which should happen Monday 
morning at 11.

decide under what conditions, if any, you should be released. 
Can I have the date and time of arrest, please? 
MR. 
Yes, your Honor. The defendant was 
arrested on Saturday, July 6, at approximately 5:30 p.m. 
THE COURT: Thank you. 
Mr. Epstein, you have the right to remain silent. You 
are not required to make any statements. Even if you have made 
any statements to the authorities, you need not make any 
further statements. Anything you do say can be used against 
you. 
You have the right to be released, either 
conditionally or unconditionally, pending trial unless I find 
that there are no conditions or combination of conditions that 
would reasonably assure your presence in court and the safety 
of the community. 
You have the right to be represented by counsel during 
all court proceedings, including this one, and during all 
questioning by the authorities. If you cannot afford an 
attorney, I will appoint one to represent you. 
It is my understanding that you are being represented 
by retained counsel. I want to advise you that the right to 
the appointment of counsel is an ongoing right that you possess 
throughout these proceedings. If at any time you are unable to 
continue with retained counsel for financial reasons, you can 
apply to the court at any time for the appointment of counsel.

Do you understand that? 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes, your Honor. 
THE COURT: Mr. Epstein, you are charged in an 
indictment in two counts. 
Count One charges you with a sex trafficking 
conspiracy in violation of Title 18 United States Code § 371. 
Count Two charges with you with the substantive 
offense of sex trafficking in violation of Title 18 United 
States Code § 1591. 
Mr. Weingarten, are you going to be lead counsel here 
today? 
MR. WEINGARTEN: Yes, your Honor. 
THE COURT: Mr. Weingarten, have you received a copy 
of the indictment? 
MR. WEINGARTEN: Yes, your Honor. 
THE COURT: Have you reviewed it with your client? 
MR. WEINGARTEN: Yes, your Honor. 
THE COURT: Do you waive its reading? 
MR. WEINGARTEN: Yes, your Honor. 
THE COURT: Mr. Epstein, how do you plead? 
THE DEFENDANT: Not guilty, your Honor. 
THE COURT: Because the defendant has been indicted, 
there will be no preliminary hearing, and that takes us to the 
question of bail. In that regard, I have received the Pretrial 
Services report. I have also received a letter from the 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS. P.C.

government dated July 8, 2019. 
I take it all counsel have the same documents? 
MR. WEINGARTEN: Yes, your Honor. 
THE COURT: I will hear from the government first, and 
then I will hear from defense counsel. 
MR. 
Yes, your Honor. 
The government intends to seek detention, and I am 
happy to explain the reasons why. Would the court prefer that 
i speak from the table or from the podium? 
THE COURT: Whatever your pleasure is. 
MR. 
Your Honor, the defendant poses an 
extraordinary risk of flight and danger presented by him. 
Given the charges and the characteristics of the defendant, he 
simply cannot reasonably be expected to appear in court if he 
is granted bail. Accordingly, the government joins the 
recommendation of Pretrial Services that the defendant be 
detained pending trial for a number of reasons. 
Starting with the conduct alleged, the defendant is 
charged with trafficking minors for sex acts, as the court 
explained, in violation of 18 United States Code E. 591, and is 
charged with a count of conspiracy to traffic minors for sex 
acts in violation of 18 U.S.C. 371. 
In particular, the indictment charges that the 
defendant engaged in a years-long scheme to sexually abuse 
underage girls, paying minor girls to themselves be abused, and 
SOUTHERN 
P.C. 
EFTA00015610

also paying certain victims to recruit other girls to be 
subject to the defendant's sexual abuse. 
The indictment alleges that the defendant undertook 
this conduct at at least two locations, including his mansion 
in Manhattan and his estate in Palm Beach, Florida. In both 
locations, victims were initially recruited to provide massages 
to the defendant, which would be performed nude or partially 
nude, would become increasingly sexual in nature, and would 
typically include one or more sex acts, including contact with 
the victims' genitals. These victims, who were often 
particularly vulnerable, were as young as 14, and the defendant 
knew he was abusing underage girls. The indictment further 
alleges that the defendant perpetrated these crimes by working 
with others, including employees and associates who facilitated 
these abusive encounters. 
Regarding the defendant himself, your Honor, he is 
extraordinarily wealthy, mobile, and unattached to the Southern 
District of New York. He maintains at least six residences in 
the United States and abroad, including the ownership of a 
private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands and a residence in 
Paris, France. Among other things, the defendant owns two 
private jets and routinely uses them to travel abroad. He is a 
man of nearly infinite means, your Honor; and, as set forth in 
our submission, he has tremendous incentives to use those means 
to flee prosecution.

The government notes as an initial matter that this is 
a presumption case because sex trafficking is charged; and, 
moreover, each of the four factors to be considered in the 
detention analysis strongly militates towards pretrial 
detention. 
So starting with the nature and seriousness of the 
offense, as previously discussed, the nature and circumstances 
of the crime are the most serious crime that this court sees. 
The defendant is alleged to have spent years sexually abusing 
minors in multiple locations and with dozens of victims. 
The seriousness of the charge is also reflected in the 
potential penalties, which include up to 45 combined years of 
incarceration on Counts One and Two, and the likelihood of a 
substantial period of incarceration is supported by the fact 
that the government's evidence is strong. There are multiple 
individual identified victims in the indictment, numerous 
specified overt acts, and dozens of overall victims alleged. 
In order to protect the privacy of the victims, your 
Honor, I'm not going to go into detail about particular 
victims, but we can say that information provided by victims 
has been detailed, it has been credible, and it has been 
corroborated by other witnesses and contemporaneous documents 
and records, including from a recent search of the defendant's 
Manhattan mansion, as I will discuss further in a moment. 
Separately, your Honor, in just the last 36 hours, 
SOUTHERN 
, P.C. 
EFTA00015612
--- PAGE 8 ---
j782epsC kjc 
that is, post charge, we have been contacted by multiple 
attorneys and several additional individuals who have 
identified themselves as victims and are interested in speaking 
with the government, none of whom the government has previously 
spoken with. 
Your Honor, the defendant is 66 years old. He is 
charged with appalling crimes, and those charges are supported 
by significant evidence, including victim and witness testimony 
and damning record evidence. He faces the very real prospect 
of spending the rest of his life in prison. He has every 
motivation in the world to flee, and he has the means to do it. 
And I will note for the court that this is a case 
where the government has really put its money where its mouth 
is on the risk of flight. This district took extraordinary 
efforts to maintain the covert status of its investigation for 
many months due to the risk of flight of the defendant -- not a 
single media report, not a single public statement, no appeals 
for victims to come forward because of precisely the flight 
risks we are discussing now. 
Turning to the characteristics of the defendant, your 
Honor, some individuals who face significant charges lack the 
means to flee. Not this defendant. As set forth in the 
government's submission, in the defendant's most recent sex 
offender registration, he lists six residences worth tens or 
hundreds of millions of dollars, including a residence abroad. 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00015613
--- PAGE 9 ---
j782epsC kjc 
The defendant has refused to answer any questions 
about his income or assets for the Pretrial Services report, so 
the scope of his wealth and his assets remains entirely 
concealed to the government and to the court. But the 
defendant certainly has access to endless means to flee, 
including two private jets. He has no meaningful family ties, 
and any argument that his properties would keep him in the 
United States ignores his ability to simply leave those 
properties behind in favor of moving beyond the reach of U.S. 
authorities to live off his extensive wealth abroad, extensive 
wealth, I should add, that the court doesn't even have any 
accounting of. He travels abroad extensively, has a residence 
in France, and all of those factors further contribute to the 
risk of flight. 
With respect to danger and obstruction, again, this is 
a presumption case, and not only is the defendant charged with 
the sexual abuse of minors, he has previously pled guilty to 
solicitation of an underage girl. This court knows that 
defendants are routinely detained in this district when facing 
such charges and that this is not an unusual position for the 
government to take. 
It is further concerning that there are credible 
allegations from the prior investigation that the defendant or 
his agents engaged in witness tampering and harassment, and in 
fact there is evidence that he was contemplating pleading 
SOUTHERN D 
S, P.C. 
EFTA00015614

IC 
j782epsC kjc 
guilty to that kind of offense in Florida. Those allegations 
include verbal harassment, evasion of legal process, and 
forcing off the road the father of an individual relevant to 
that investigation. 
THE COURT: Can you elaborate on that last point about 
forcing somebody off the road? 
IIIIIIIIIII 
MR. 
Your Honor, what we have is the 
record evidence from an underlying civil dispute in Florida 
that discusses this incident and discusses it in the context of 
a potential plea of the defendant to obstruction or harassment 
charges. The government sets before this court that if the 
defendant was willing to undertake such measure simply as a 
result of an investigation, the potential for dangerous and 
obstructive activity in an indicted case is alarming and very 
real. 
Despite having been previously convicted of a sex 
offense involving an underage victim and being a registered sex 
offender, the defendant has continued to maintain a vast trove 
of lewd photography of young-looking women or girls at his 
mansion. Your Honor, pursuant to judicially authorized 
warrants, law enforcement agents searched his home on Saturday 
and found at least hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of sexually 
suggestive photographs of nude females, many of whom appear to 
be underage. 
I also want to note that the search revealed specific

j782epsC kjc 
evidence from his home consistent with victim accounts. Ever 
the room where the abuse occurred, your Honor, the massage 
room, was still set up in the same way it was 15 years ago, 
with a massage table and sex paraphernalia. 
And with respect to the photographs 
THE COURT: When you say the evidence was consistent 
with victim accounts, is it limited to the massage table and 
massage room or is there something else? 
MR. 
Descriptions of the massage room and 
the massage table, that's correct, your Honor. 
THE COURT: Okay. All right. 
MR. 
With respect to the photographs, your 
Honor, some of those were found in a locked safe which also 
held electronic disks with labels that included the words 
"Young Miscellaneous Nudes 1" and "Girl Pics Nude." 
Your Honor, this is not an individual who has left his 
past behind. He is a continuing danger to the community and an 
extraordinary risk of flight and, for those reasons, the 
government joins the pretrial recommendation that the defendant 
be detained pending trial. 
THE COURT: All right. Thank you. 
Mr. Weingarten. 
MR. WEINGARTEN: Thank you, your Honor. I will use 
the podium, if that's okay. 
THE COURT: That's fine. 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00015616
--- PAGE 12 ---
j782epsC kjc 
MR. WEINGARTEN: So your Honor, I would like to start 
by providing some context, and then I'm going to make a 
suggestion as to how we proceed. 
The beginning here is 2005 in Florida. That's when an 
allegation was received by the local police that Mr. Epstein 
was engaged in sexual conduct for money, prostitution. 
Thereafter, there was a very sophisticated three-year 
investigation by law enforcement, including locals and feds, 
into Mr. Epstein's conduct. Numerous girls were interviewed, 
employees were interviewed, and it is fair to say that a 
significant segment of the law enforcement community in Florida 
thought what we had in hand was simple prostitution. There was 
no coercion. There were no threats. There was no violence. 
And it is also fair to say that a significant portion of the 
law enforcement community in Florida believed that a local 
misdemeanor was the appropriate sanction. 
Now, it is also --
THE COURT: Did you represent Mr. Epstein in the 
Florida investigation? 
MR. WEINGARTEN: No, but I'm familiar with the 
records. 
THE COURT: All right. 
MR. WEINGARTEN: It is also true that there was a 
contrary view largely taken by the feds, and what ensued was a 
complex set of discussions and negotiations and finally an 
SOUTHERN DI TRICT REPORTER 
P.C. 
EFTA00015617
--- PAGE 13 ---
j782epsC kjc 
agreement, an agreement that was consummated and agreed to all 
the way up to main justice at a very, very high level. 
The agreement involved a plea in state court to 
soliciting an underaged girl, which would require registration, 
compensation paid to alleged victims, and an NPA from the feds, 
in other words, a declination by the federal government, an 
agreement that was approved all the way up in main justice and 
it sure seemed like a global solution at the time to everyone 
involved, including my client. 
What happened since then? Mr. Epstein continued a 
life of success, generosity, creativity and, more important, 
law-abiding life from 2008 forward. How do we know? Because 
when you are in registration the way he is, every single night 
his whereabouts are known. There is constant reporting, 
constant monitoring, and absolutely, to our knowledge, no 
complaints by anybody from that moment forward about his 
conduct until we have arrived in court here. 
Now, what has happened in court from that moment? 
There have been lawsuits, many of them ludicrous, dismissed out 
of hand. But when something like this happens, a lot of stuff 
comes out of the woodwork, and there were lawsuits that 
Mr. Epstein settled also in the normal course. 
There was one particular litigation that leads to this 
occasion, and that is, under the Crime Victims Rights Act, that 
act simply says that victims have a right to be consulted by 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00015618
--- PAGE 14 ---
j782epsC kjc 
the United States, and there are alleged victims in this case 
who complain that they were not, and there has been extensive 
litigation in the Southern District of Florida before 
Judge Marra on that very subject. In fact, the judge concluded 
that the prosecutors from the Southern District of Florida did 
not adequately notify some of the victims about the ongoing 
discussions and the consummation of the deal and, in 
particular, the NPA. The United States took the position that 
they had no responsibility to do so, that they had treated the 
victims properly, and that matter continues to this day. 
The consequences of that matter are overwhelming, 
because the judge suggested, I think three times, that the NPA, 
the declination, could be voided. And we think about that for 
a second. So a defendant negotiates what he thinks is a global 
solution with the feds. He does his time --
THE COURT: Does the nonprosecution agreement in 
Florida -- the nonprosecution agreements in the Southern 
District routinely say they are limited to the Southern 
District of New York. 
MR. WEINGARTEN: Obviously --
THE COURT: Is there a similar provision in the 
Florida agreement? 
MR. WEINGARTEN: I don't want to misstate. It is not 
before me. It is obviously going to be an important part of 
the pretrial motions. What is for sure is that there was - 
SOUTHERN DI TRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00015619
--- PAGE 15 ---
j782epsC kjc 
the negotiation with the Southern District included 
negotiations with main justice. What's also true is the 
investigation extended into the Southern District of New York 
and elsewhere in terms of girls being interviewed. 
So obviously your question is relevant and will be 
part of the pretrial litigation for sure. But what matters 
here and for now is there certainly was a belief that there was 
a global solution based upon the facts on the ground. 
THE COURT: Have you seen the Florida nonprosecution 
agreement? 
MR. WEINGARTEN: Yes. 
THE COURT: And --
MR. WEINGARTEN: I don't have it before me. I don't 
want to make a specific representation and not be completely 
accurate. 
THE COURT: Okay. All right. Go ahead. 
MR. WEINGARTEN: The consequences of this are huge in 
that if in fact there is a negotiation with a defendant, the 
defendant does his time, the defendant pays his victim, and the 
defendant spends ten years on the registration list and 
prosecutors don't adequately notify the victims, how in the 
world can that deal be undone? Every prosecutor in the world 
has to oppose that possibility. No defense attorney in their 
right mind would negotiate a deal with that potential 
consequence. 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00015620
--- PAGE 16 ---
j782epsC kjc 
So this is a huge problem for the department and what 
solution ensues, and I suggest the solution that ensued is this 
indictment. To 
The allegations

us, this indictment is essentially a do-over. 
are from 2002 to 2005. This is old stuff. 
stuff. This is the very stuff that was 
the feds in Florida, a sophisticated three-year 
Two of the alleged victims in this indictment 
are from Florida. The indictment here tracks the conduct that 
was investigated in Florida back before the agreement was 
reached. Obviously we need to get discovery to find out just 
how inextricably linked the investigation back in Florida is 
with what's going on here. We do know we are talking about 
ancient conduct. We do know we are talking about facts that 
are from 2002 to 2005, facts that were known to the United 
States prosecutors before they entered into the NPA, the 
declination. This is essentially a redo. That's how it feels 
to us. And if we are correct, that should chill the blood of 
every defense attorney who negotiates a deal with the United 
States. 
In addition, we have 
the central allegation here is 
trafficking, and obviously it is useful and relevant to make 
inquiry as to why the trafficking law was passed. It is to 
cover abhorrent conduct, where 
are fooled, they are forced to 
places, work in brothels where 
young girls are kidnapped, they 
come usually to unfamiliar 
they service 15, 20 guys in a 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00015621
--- PAGE 17 ---
j782epsC kjc 
day. They can't leave or else their families are threatened. 
This is dreadful conduct. 
I remember an occasion when the Attorney General Eric 
Holder and I think Director Comey had a press conference 
establishing this as a law enforcement priority. Every 
sensible person in the world would think that this is the exact 
right thing law enforcement should do. 
This is not this case. There was no violence. There 
was no coercion. There was no intimidation. There is no 
deception. The bottom line, if you take a fair look at the 
facts of this case as alleged and in the record, you may come 
to the conclusion there was prostitution involved and maybe a 
lot of it, but that doesn't mean that the person involved is 
pedophile, a rapist or, heaven knows, a trafficker. Just --
THE COURT: Well, if the women involved were under 18, 
isn't that rape? 
MR. WEINGARTEN: My understanding --
THE COURT: Legally they are incapable of consent, are 
they not? 
MR. WEINGARTEN: Well, it could be statutory rape. 
But what I am talking about is trafficking and why the 
statute was passed, and obviously the statute was passed to 
protect women from the horrors that occur in such settings, and 
that is light years removed to what happened in this case. 
So what about bond? I would suggest that the 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00015622
--- PAGE 18 ---
j782epsC kjc 
traditional issues that we look at, the issues involved, let's 
start with that, we believe we have extremely powerful motions 
relating to the government seeking two bites at the apple and 
for due process reasons, double jeopardy reasons, we don't 
think that will stand. We also think fundamentally what's at 
issue here is not trafficking. That's not why the statute was 
passed. 
The risk to others, what we have here is at least ten 
years post incarceration in the State of Florida of conduct 
that has never been challenged by anyone until now. The 
registration requirements are onerous. He is under constant 
surveillance. Law enforcement knows, if they choose to look, 
exactly where he is at any time. 
The risk of flight, what is true is from the moment of 
Judge Marra's litigation in the Southern District of Florida, 
the defendant knew that there would be challenges to the NPA. 
From 2013 on, there were representations made in court that 
that challenge was ongoing, and the defendant never sought to 
flee, never anticipated a time when he would flee, continued to 
live his law-abiding life. So the risk of flight, I think, is 
dramatically overstated in the government's presentation. 
I think the traditional remedies that the court finds 
appropriate in case after case -- a large cash bond; passport 
relinquished; waiving extradition; a bracelet on; some form of 
supervision that is adequate to guarantee his appearance, it 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00015623
--- PAGE 19 ---
j782epsC kjc 
will be child's play to find that; bonds from other people, 
surety bonds from other people. 
Because we have not had an opportunity to see our 
client until today and because we have just received the 
government's submission, what we would like to do is have the 
opportunity to sit down and put together a bail package, a 
coherent bail package in writing and provide it to the court. 
I would point out on the obstruction allegation 
THE COURT: Let me ask you this -- sorry to interrupt 
you -- do you want to adjourn the detention hearing? Under the 
statute, you have up to three days. 
MR. WEINGARTEN: What I would like is to have until 
the end of the week to provide something in writing, a specific 
recommendation in writing. 
THE COURT: So you want to adjourn a determination of 
bail? 
MR. WEINGARTEN: Yes. 
THE COURT: Is there any objection to that from the 
government? The defendant is detained in the interim under 
3142(f). 
MR. WEINGARTEN: Right. 
MR. 
Your Honor, we certainly don't object 
if the defendant is consenting to detention with leave to make 
a further application. 
I think the government would like at least a brief 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00015624
--- PAGE 20 ---
j782epsC kjc 
opportunity to respond to some of those points, to the extent 
that the defense is arguing that Mr. Epstein should be granted 
bail as a general matter and the court is going to consider 
those arguments. 
THE COURT: Well, the court always considers the 
parties' arguments. 
But let me just come back to Mr. Weingarten for a 
minute. Mr. Weingarten, under the Bail Reform Act you are 
entitled to a continuance of three days, which I guess would 
take us to Thursday. 
MR. WEINGARTEN: Right. 
THE COURT: The other alternative, I guess, if you 
want to de facto extend that three days is consent to detention 
without prejudice. 
MR. WEINGARTEN: We estimated that by Thursday we 
could get you something in writing and then appear back before 
you at your convenience. 
THE COURT: Okay. Do you want to schedule it -- well, 
I think Thursday's proceedings right now would be in front of 
Judge Berman unless he wants to send it back to me for bail, 
but do you want to put this down for detention hearing on 
Thursday? 
MR. WEINGARTEN: Can I make one point that I don't 
want to forget that I think is extremely important? 
THE COURT: Go ahead. 
SOUTHERN DI TRICT REPORTER 
P.C. 
EFTA00015625
--- PAGE 21 ---
j782epsC kjc 
MR. WEINGARTEN: The last thing we did today was 
refuse to answer questions. What we said at Pretrial is heaven 
forbid we make a mistake, and in terms of assets, we wanted to 
be precise. So there was no refusal. There was a request for 
time to supplement. That was accepted. And that's part of the 
reason we want to sit down and make sure we get our information 
correct to provide to the court. 
THE COURT: All right. 
MR. WEINGARTEN: Can I make one other point? 
THE COURT: Sure. 
MR. WEINGARTEN: In terms of the obstruction, I think 
it is such a significant part of our argument that the conduct 
at issue is ancient. It is from 2002 to 2005. So obviously if 
the defendant is a threat to obstruct justice, the court needs 
to take that into account. The allegations raised -- and I 
just read them briefly because we just got the government's 
letter -- relate to negotiations between the feds and the 
defendant. Back when the Southern District of Florida was 
attempting to find an appropriate remedy, there were 
discussions going back and forth: Can we squeeze you into this 
statute? And it didn't work, and it didn't work because there 
is no factual basis. That is the reference to the alleged 
obstruction. Not obstructive acts. Instead, the feds in 
Florida agreed to the plea to the state offense because there 
was no appropriate statute that covered conduct that was 
SOUTHERN 
P.C. 
EFTA00015626
--- PAGE 22 ---
j782epsC kjc 
proveable. That is the answer to the obstruction issue. 
THE COURT: All right. So you want to adjourn the 
detention hearing until Thursday? 
MR. WEINGARTEN: Yes. 
THE COURT: All right. Is there any objection to that 
from the government? I think under the statute he is entitled 
to three days. 
MR. 
That is, of course, fine, your Honor. 
I think we would like just a very brief opportunity to 
respond to some of those arguments so that they don't sort of 
hang with the court for three days unresponded to. 
THE COURT: All right. Go ahead. 
MR. 
think a lot of that discussion was entirely orthogonal to the 
Just very briefly, your Honor, I 
issues here. 
But just very briefly, with respect to the charges 
here, there is simply no force required for underage victims. 
A grand jury has properly returned an indictment, and these are 
fact issues that are being presented in large part. 
Certainly the concept of child prostitution is, 
frankly, offensive and not recognized in federal law. The idea 
that children can consent to sex and be prostitutes is beyond 
the realm of federal law which contemplates trafficking, which 
is what has been charged here. Mr. Weingarten is free to argue 
to a jury that trafficking minors was only statutory rape or 
SOUTHERN 
, P.C. 
EFTA00015627
--- PAGE 23 ---
j782epsC kjc 
that those victims weren't treated as badly as the parade of 
horribles he has in mind. But for now the question is whether 
the defendant's attendance can be assured. 
And with respect to the nonprosecution agreement 
THE COURT: I'm not sure I would refer to something as 
only statutory rape. The use of the word "only" before 
"statutory rape" I'm not sure sits well. But go ahead. 
MR. 
And I agree, your Honor. 
With respect to the actual substance, the Southern 
District of Florida has represented in public filings that the 
nonprosecution agreement was limited to the Southern District 
of Florida, and we can litigate that in a motion to dismiss, 
but it is simply not relevant here. 
With respect to the statute of limitations, 
Mr. Weingarten says that the conduct is old. He did not say 
that that it is beyond the statute of limitations because it is 
not. 
And, finally, it is not the same conduct. Some of the 
conduct overlaps. Some of the conduct does not. And in 
particular, one of the two counts of the indictment is 
predicated exclusively on New York victims. 
So for all of those reasons, we just ask the court to 
consider those responses as it awaits the defendant's filings 
later this week. 
MR. WEINGARTEN: Can I just make one point to clarify? 
SOUTHERN 
P.C. 
EFTA00015628
--- PAGE 24 ---
j782epsC kjc 
THE COURT: Go ahead. 
MR. WEINGARTEN: On the statutory rape thing, I had 
senior moment. There is no statutory rape because there is no 
penetration, and that is the answer to that question. 
THE COURT: All right. 
We will set this down for a detention hearing on 
Thursday, July 11, for the continuation of the detention 
hearing. Thursday, July 11, at 2 p.m. 
The defendant is detained at least until the 
continuation of the detention hearing pursuant to 18 United 
States Code 3142(f). 
I have been advised by Judge Berman that he wants to 
see counsel right after these proceedings. Judge Berman's 
courtroom is 17B. So counsel and Mr. Epstein should go to 178. 
All right. Anything else from the government? 
MR. 
: Your Honor, ordinarily we would ask 
to exclude speedy trial time, but I think because we are going 
directly to Judge Berman, we have no such application. 
THE COURT: Mr. Weingarten, anything else? 
MR. WEINGARTEN: No, thank you, your Honor. 
THE COURT: Mr. Weingarten, anything else? 
MR. WEINGARTEN: No, your Honor. 
THE COURT: All right. Thank you all.

Chris, 
Following up on these issues: 
• For #3, the attachments were not recovered from the searched devices. We do not have them, which is why they 
were not produced. 
• For #4, the electronic files recovered from Epstein's devices have the same metadata on the hard drive that was 
available when the FBI seized each file. For files that were carved or deleted, no metadata was recovered, so none 
is viewable, except for data showing when a particular file was saved to a drive by the investigative team or 
prepared for production. I am not aware of any additional metadata in our possession that you do not have for 
these files. 
• For #5, those photographs were not processed by CART, which is why they do not have a CART number. They came 
from the CDs that your team reviewed last week. The available metadata for those photographs was produced in 
two excel spreadsheets with the same production — one with metadata for nude images (which were contained on 
one of the hard drives you reviewed last week), and one with metadata for non-nude images (which were 
produced in the November 9, 2020 discovery production). As I mentioned in my email to Laura earlier today, I am 
working with our vendor to figure out how to best convey to you which Bates numbers correspond with which rows 
in the spreadsheet. 
• For #6: 
o The SDNY_GM_SUPP contain electronic files recovered from Epstein's devices. As noted above, those files 
have the same metadata on the hard drive that was available when the FBI seized each file. For files that 
were carved or deleted, no metadata was recovered, so none is viewable. 
o The videos from SDNY005 (October 20, 2020 production) were converted by a vendor from VHS and cassette 
tapes, so there is no metadata to provide. The Sept-Otto 2020 dates reflect when these recordings were 
converted by our vendor. 
o The SDNY011 (November 9, 2020 production) consists of images from the CDs seized from Epstein's 
residences, which you reviewed last week. As referenced above, those photographs were not processed by 
CART, which is why they do not have a CART number. As referenced above, the available metadata for those 
photographs was produced in two excel spreadsheets with the same production — one with metadata for 
nude images (which were contained on one of the hard drives you reviewed last week), and one with 
metadata for non-nude images (which were produced in the November 9, 2020 discovery production). As I 
mentioned in my email to Laura earlier today, I am working with our vendor to figure out how to best convey

Apologies for the late response on this. It seems like it would be better to confer after you have heard back from your 
vendor, since the answers to #3-#6 will depend on what the vendor says. And I believe we have now resolved #7. 
As for #1 and #2, I will call 
at MDC and represent to her that we have your concurrence to send the 
drive directly to Ms. Maxwell. If she agrees, we can add the additional productions to our drive before we send it. If she 
refuses, we will take it up with Judge Nathan.

Chris, 
We are available for a call to discuss tomorrow between 1pm and 2pm, between 3pm and 5pm, or after 5:30pm. Please 
let us know if there is a time in those windows that would work on your end. In the meantime, below are some initial 
responses: 
1. Our supervisors have indicated that we are not permitted to send a drive that our IT department did not load to 
the MDC. As a result, we cannot provide the drive directly to the MDC. That said, I am happy to join you in asking 
the MDC to accept the drive from you. If the MDC still refuses, then my office would not object to an application to 
Judge Nathan for an order directing the MDC to accept the drive from you, though we would need to allow MDC 
legal counsel the opportunity to note their objections to Judge Nathan. 
2. The MDC recently alerted us to this issue, and our paralegal converted the excel files at issue to pdfs and sent a 
new CD with those pdfs to the MDC. If you client still cannot view them, then we are happy to load them to a drive 
if you would like to provide one for us. 
3. I have asked our vendor to look into this issue and will get back to you when I have spoken with them. 
4. I have asked our vendor to look into this issue and will get back to you when I have spoken with them. That said, 
similar to the note I sent in my email regarding highly confidential images on March 16, 2021, the electronic files 
recovered from Epstein's devices have the same metadata on the hard drive that was available when the FBI seized 
each file. For files that were carved or deleted, no metadata was recovered, so none is viewable, except for data 
showing when a particular file was saved to a drive by the investigative team or prepared for production. 
5. As indicated in our November 9, 2020 discovery letter, all images within Bates range SDNY_GM_00467566 though 
SDNY_GM_00514100 were seized during the 2019 searches of Epstein residences. These are the images from the 
CDs that were recovered during those searches, so they did not come from any of the electronic devices that were 
the subject of extractions by CART. As a result, these images would not have CART numbers. As for the metadata, I 
have asked our vendor to look into this issue and will get back to you when I have spoken with them. 
6. I have asked our vendor to look into this issue and will get back to you when I have spoken with them. That said, I 
note again that the electronic files recovered from Epstein's devices have the same metadata on the hard drive that 
was available when the FBI seized each file. For files that were carved or deleted, no metadata was recovered, so 
none is viewable. Additionally, as indicated in our November 9, 2020 discovery letter, all images within the 
SDNY011 load file (Bates range SDNY_GM_00467566 though SDNY_GM_00514100) were seized during the 2019 
searches of Epstein residences. These are the images from the CDs that were recovered during those searches, so 
they did not come from any of the electronic devices that were the subject of extractions by CART. As a result, 
these images would not have CART numbers. 
7. I have asked our paralegals and vendor to look into the Bates gap and will get back to you when I have spoken to 
them.

We write to raise a few issues concerning the discovery. Below is the list of items. Please let me know if you are free for a 
call to discuss. 
1. On our last call, we asked you if we could send our client a hard drive containing the discovery that we had created 
(without the highly confidential items). You had said you would check to see if you could facilitate this. We have 
not heard back from you. Are you able to send Ms. Maxwell the hard drive? 
2. The last two productions you sent to Ms. Maxwell on disks. As you know, she cannot read disks on her laptop and 
must use the prison computer. But the prison computer cannot read some of the files. We can include these files 
on our hard drive to send to Ms. Maxwell. Otherwise, you will need to produce them on a hard drive. Please 
advise which way you would like to proceed. 
3. A number of the emails in the discovery — over 109,000 — were produced without their attachments (see tab 1 of 
the attached Excel file). Instead, the attachments appear as slip-sheets (see example attached). Please provide the 
missing attachments, if they exist. 
4. A number of electronic documents — over 110,000 — that were extracted from one of Epstein's devices, as identified 
by a CART number, have metadata that indicates a "date created" or "date last modified" date in July 2020 or 
afterwards (see tab 2 of the attached Excel file). We request that you produce a metadata overlay with the original 
metadata for these files. 
5. A number of photographs — over 6500 — were produced in native format, but do not have a CART number and have 
"date created" and/or "date last modified" dates after July 2019 (see tab 3 of the attached Excel file). Please 
provide the CART number for these photographs or specify which device they came from. Also, we request that 
you produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files. 
6. A number of the audio/visual files — over 460 — have similar metadata issues (see tab 4 of the attached Excel file). 
These fall into the following buckets: 
a. SDNY GM SUPP: these have CART numbers, but were produced without metadata load files and have 
"date created" and "date last modified" dates in September-November 2020, after the date the device was 
seized. We request that you produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files. 
EFTA00015639
--- PAGE 5 ---
b. SDNY005 (October 20 2020 production): these are a few videos from the SDFL or PBPD investigations that 
were produced in native form without metadata load files. They have Sept-Oct 2020 dates. We request that 
you produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files. 
c. SDNY011 (November 9 2020 production): these were produced in native form with load files, but do not 
reference a CART number and have Sept 2020 dates. We request that you provide a CART number for these 
files or indicate their source. Also, we request that you produce a metadata overlay with the original 
metadata for these files. 
7. There is a gap between 11/18 and 12/18 production numbers (SDNY_GM_02742044 to 2742183). Was that 
intentional or are we missing those documents? 
Please let us know your responses as soon as possible.

Hatescape: An In-Depth Analysis of Extremism and Hate Speech on TikTok — Institute for Strategic 
Dialogue (24 August 2021) TikTok is now one of the world's leading social media platforms, used by millions 
daily to create videos that are stylish, eye-catching and technically impressive and that inspire others to join 
in. The platform's videos give rise to countless viral trends across online platforms, with content spread 
across other social media sites. But TikTok is also popular with those intent on using online spaces to 
produce, post and promote hate and extremism. Academic research and news investigations have reported on 
the problematic side of TikTok, but there is still a significant knowledge gap on how unique aspects of the 
platform are used at scale to direct hatred at others. ISD set out to examine the state of hate on TikTok in two 
ways. The first objective involved analysing how individuals or groups promote hateful ideologies and target 
people on the platform based on numerous protected attributes such as ethnicity, religion, gender or others. The 
second objective involved using the same framework but investigating how features on TikTok like 
profiles, hashtags, share functions, video effects and music are used to spread hate.

• The right to vote is the foundation of our democracy, the right from which all other rights ultimately flow. 
Protection of that right is a top priority of the Justice Department. Indeed, it was one of the principal 
reasons for the Department's founding in 1870. 
• Today [Aug. 26], we must protect not only the right of eligible voters to vote. We must also protect those 
who administer our voting systems from threats and intimidation. Only by protecting those who 
administer the election process can we ensure that the right to vote, itself, is protected.

• John Binns, a 21-year-old American who moved to Turkey a few years ago, told The Wall Street Journal he 
was behind the [T-Mobile] security breach. Mr. Binns, who since 2017 has used several online aliases, 
communicated with the Journal in Telegram messages from an account that discussed details of the hack 
before they were widely known. 
• The breach is the third major customer data leak that T-Mobile has disclosed in the past two years. The 
Bellevue, Wash., company is the second-largest U.S. mobile carrier with roughly 90 million cellphones

Far-right extremist groups are "actively recruiting" past and present members of the military and police, according to a 
declassified Canadian intelligence report obtained by Global News. The report cited 17 examples in Canada, the U.S., 
U.K., Germany and New Zealand which "illustrate the intersections and relationships between ideologically motivated 
violent extremism and uniformed personnel." Six of the cases involved members of the Canadian military or reserves... It 
said the groups included the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers and Boogabo Movement, as well as the Three Percenters — a so-
called patriot group that took part in the Jan. 6 assault at the U.S. Capitol...

HOUSTON — Two alleged members of one of the most serious transnational criminal organizations will make their initial 
appearances in U.S. federal court on charges of narco-terrorism and distributing kilogram quantities of cocaine from 
Colombia. This is the first time believed members of the National Liberation Army (Ejercito de Liberaci6n Nacional aka

U.S. officials provided Taliban with names of Americans, Afghan allies to evacuate 
"Basically, they just put all those Afghans on a kill list," said one defense official.

U.S. officials in Kabul gave the Taliban a list of names of American citizens, green card holders and Afghan allies to grant 
entry into the militant-controlled outer perimeter of the city's airport, a choice that's prompted outrage behind the scenes 
from lawmakers and military officials. The move, detailed to POLITICO by three U.S. and congressional officials, was 
designed to expedite the evacuation of tens of thousands of people from Afghanistan as chaos erupted in Afghanistan's 
capital city last week after the Taliban seized control of the country. It also came as the Biden administration has been 
relying on the Taliban for security outside the airport... But the decision to provide specific names to the Taliban, which has 
a history of brutally murdering Afghans who collaborated with the U.S. and other coalition forces during the conflict, has 
angered lawmakers and military officials... 
ISKP Claims Attack Near Hamid Karzai International Airport As Suicide Bombing [SITE Intelligence] 
• The group's 'Amaq News Agency issued a report on the incident on August 26, 2021, and provided a 
photo of the bomber, "Abdul Rahman al-Logari". 
• According to the message, the Khorasan Province (ISKP) fighter reached a distance of "no more than five 
meters from the American forces," and detonated his explosive belt, killing 60 and wounding over 100 
others. IS "military sources" said more than 20 American soldiers were killed and wounded in the attack.

Islamic State pours scorn on Taliban victory in Afghanistan while experts warn of 'new phase of jihad' 
David Rose, Beirut, The Times (London), Friday August 20 2021, 12.00pm BST,

phase-of-jihad-3v72cig3clq
Islamic State has poured scorn on the Taliban's victory in Afghanistan, claiming that its Islamist rival had merely been 
handed the country by the withdrawal of American troops. In its first comment since the Taliban's takeover in Kabul, the 
terrorist group declared that the Afghan movement had not fought a true "jihad" — or holy war — and expressed doubt that 
it could implement true sharia law in Afghanistan. It also mocked "the new Taliban" as a tool "in the guise of Islam", which 
would be used by the US to mislead Muslims and to fight Islamic State's own presence in the region. The comments came 
in an editorial in the group's al-Naba newspaper, which is disseminated online via encrypted messaging apps, despite 
efforts to suppress it, and is considered a mouthpiece for the group's leaders. "It is a victory for peace, not for Islam; [a 
victory] for negotiations, not jihad," the editorial published yesterday said, referring to the Taliban's takeover. Analysts said 
that Isis militants were "jealous" of their ideological rivals' success, but also noted the group's warning that it could stage a 
"new phase of jihad" in response, including in Afghanistan... 
What We Know About The Kabul Airport Attack That Killed US Troops [ABC News] 
• An explosion that killed at least 13 U.S. service members in Afghanistan Thursday [Aug. 26] was part of a 
"complex" attack near the Kabul airport, the Pentagon said. 
• Two ISIS suicide bombers detonated in the vicinity of both the Kabul airport's Abbey Gate and the 
adjacent Baron Hotel, according to Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, the commander of U.S. Central Command. 
• The U.S. service members killed included 10 Marines, one Army, one to be determined and one Navy 
hospital corpsman, or medic. A 13th service member injured in the attack later died.

[President]  Biden Vows To 'Hunt Down' ISIS-K For Double Suicide Bomb Attack That Killed 13 US Troops 
And 90 Afghans. Takes Responsibility For Carnage But Stands By Troop Withdrawal 
After Decades Of War, ISIS And Al Qaeda Can Still Wreak Havoc [New York Times] 
• The twin suicide bombings near the Kabul airport on Thursday [Aug. 26] underscored the devastating 
power these groups still have to inflict mass casualties in spite of the American effort. 
• And they raised haunting questions about whether the Taliban can live up to the central promise they 
made when the Trump administration agreed in early 2020 to withdraw American forces from the 
country — that Afghanistan would no longer be a staging ground for attacks against the United States and 
its allies. 
• The Taliban's lightning takeover of the country hardly assures that all militants in Afghanistan are under 
their control. To the contrary, the Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan — known as Islamic State Khorasan 
or ISIS-K — is a bitter, albeit much smaller, rival that has carried out dozens of attacks in Afghanistan this 
year (2021] against civilians, officials and the Taliban themselves. 
The Taliban Are Far Closer to the Islamic State Than They Claim — Foreign Policy (26 August 2021) 
In an early sign of Afghanistan's dystopian future as well as a reminder of its dark past, a coordinated suicide 
attack hit several locations in Kabul, including a hotel and the airport. Dozens of people were killed and 
hundreds injured, including Afghan civilians attempting to leave the country and the U.S. soldiers overseeing 
the evacuation. Islamic State-Khorasan has taken responsibility, but the Taliban faction partially in control of 
security in Kabul over the past several days, the Haqqani network, must also be scrutinized. Ultimately, the 
attack strategically benefits the Haqqani as it will likely speed up foreign departures and prevent the prospect of 
further evacuations. There have been repeated warnings of a potential airport attack over the last week. When 
EFTA00015650
--- PAGE 6 ---
it came, it was not spontaneous or random but a well-planned assault, using multiple bombs and targets 
calculated to achieve several objectives. The first and most obvious goal was to kill fleeing Afghans and 
discourage others from attempting to leave via the airport—or to close the airport itself. But another goal was 
the death of coalition troops, thus using the specter of tenor to ensure the West stuck to the agreed on Aug. 
deadline to leave the country. The timing of the attack, on the cusp of the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 
attacks, sends out a powerful signal to other jihadists. 
In Taliban-Ruled Afghanistan, Al Qaeda-Linked Haqqani Network Rises to Power 
Haqqani network's new prominence undermines Taliban's claims of severing terrorist ties 
By Sune Engel Rasmussen and Nancy A. Youssef, Wall Street Journal, Aug. 26, 2021 11:00 am ET

After taking control of Afghanistan, the Taliban has pledged to be a responsible member of the international community that 
doesn't pose a threat to any country's security. However, the Islamist movement's victory in Afghanistan has elevated its 
most radical and violent branch, the Haqqani network. Having perpetrated some of the deadliest attacks of the 20-year war, 
the network—unlike the broader Taliban—has been designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S. since 2012. Closely 
linked to al Qaeda, the network also has for decades been involved in the hostage-taking of Westerners, and currently 
holds at least one American citizen captive, according to U.S. officials. "I do not believe that anyone in the West fully 
understands the reach of the Haqqani network," said retired Lt. Gen. Michael K. Nagata, a former director of strategy for 
the National Counterterrorism Center. "It is the single most impressive nonstate militant group I have ever seen, with the 
exception of ISIS in the first two years of the caliphate?... 
Who are Isis-K, the new threat on Afghan horizon? 
Catherine Philp, Diplomatic Correspondent, The Times (London), August 25 2021, 5.OOpm BST

Military planners are warning that the chaos in Afghanistan could give rise to a separate and more extreme threat than 
even the Taliban, as the regional arm of Islamic State seeks to strengthen its position. Isis-K, or the Islamic State of 
Khorasan, is an affiliate of the group that overran large parts of Syria and Iraq to establish a so-called "caliphate". Isis-K, 
established in eastern Afghanistan in 2015, is a swom enemy of the Taliban and the two groups have clashed repeatedly. It 
was initially drawn largely from fighters of the Pakistani Taliban, not the Afghan group, but has raided the Afghan Taliban's 
ranks too. Khorasan is a traditional name for the Central Asian and South Asian area that Afghanistan is part of, similar to 
the name al-Sham that the group used to refer to the Levant. Unlike the Afghan Taliban, whose focus remains on 
Afghanistan, Isis-K has repeatedly articulated its desire to attack the United Nations and western powers. While its strength 
is focused in the provinces bordering Pakistan, the source of present concern about the group is its ability to strike the 
capital, Kabul, as it has before with suicide bombings...

WASHINGTON—The Central Intelligence Agency and the U.S. military are conducting extraction operations to evacuate 
Americans using helicopters and ground troops as the window begins to close for rescuing all people at risk in Afghanistan. 
The CIA has launched clandestine operations to rescue Americans in and outside Kabul in recent days, according to U.S. 
and other officials. The missions are using American military helicopters but under the control of the CIA, a typical 
arrangement in such operations. A congressional source knowledgeable about the evacuation effort said U.S. troops had 
gone into Kabul on joint missions with other foreign allies, including Britain and France, to designated locations where they 
had picked up citizens from all those nations, U.S. green-card holders, and Afghans who hold special visas for helping the 
U.S. military...

Nigerian Government Says "Safe to Assume" Boko Haram Leader is Dead 
On August 23, Nigeria's government said that it no longer has 
any doubts that Abubakar Shekau, the leader of Boko Haram, is 
dead. 
• 
Reports of Shekau's death first emerged three months 
ago following a confrontation between Boko Haram and 
its rival, Islamic State West Africa Province (!SWAP), 
in the Sambisa Forest. 
• 
Nigerian officials initially expressed skepticism about 
the reports. 
• 
On August 23, Information Minister Lai Mohammed 
said in an interview that "our position is that he has been 
reported dead and he is dead." 
• 
Mohammed cited the "instability ... and the struggle for 
succession," thousands of Boko Haram 
adherents 
surrendering, and "reports from the camp of Boko 
Haram itself' as evidence. 
• 
A U.S. military official agreed, stating, "We think he 
was probably killed."

Significant Dates in History 
August 27, 1979 
Northwest coast of Ireland 
Mountbatten Killed by IRA 
Brief Description: On August 27, 1979, Lord Louis Mountbatten is killed when Irish Republican Army (IRA) terrorists 
detonate a 50-pound bomb hidden on his fishing vessel Shadow V. Mountbatten, a war hero, elder statesman, and 
second cousin of Queen Elizabeth II, was spending the day with his family in Donegal Bay off Ireland's northwest 
coast when the bomb exploded. Three others were killed in the attack, including Mountbatten's 14-year-old 
grandson, Nicholas. Later that day, an IRA bombing attack on land killed 18 British paratroopers in County Down, 
Northern Ireland. 
The assassination of Mountbatten was the first blow struck against the British royal family by the IRA during its long 
terrorist campaign to drive the British out of Northern Ireland and unite it with the Republic of Ireland to the south. 
The attack hardened the hearts of many Brits against the IRA and convinced Margaret Thatcher's government to take 
a hard-line stance against the terrorist organization. 
The IRA immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it detonated the bomb by remote control from the 
coast. It also took responsibility for the same-day bombing attack against British troops in County Down, which 
claimed 18 lives. 
IRA member Thomas McMahon was later arrested and convicted of preparing and planting the bomb that destroyed 
Mountbatten's boat. A near-legend in the IRA, he was a leader of the IRA's notorious South Armagh Brigade, which 
killed more than 100 British soldiers. He was one of the first IRA members to be sent to Libya to train with 
detonators and timing devices and was an expert in explosives. Authorities believe the Mountbatten assassination 
was the work of many people, but McMahon was the only individual convicted. Sentenced to life in prison, he was 
released in 1998 along with other IRA and Unionist terrorists under a controversial provision of the Good Friday 
Agreement, Northern Ireland's peace deal. McMahon claimed he had turned his back on the IRA and was becoming 
a carpenter.

Subject: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell --
There are prosecutors who would be afraid to charge a case that would require them to prove sex crimes that took place 
in 1994. If you want to find them, you'll have to go to Florida. This is the Southern District of New York. 
It is never too late for justice. Sometimes, you just have to have faith in the power of the truth and hope twelve jurors 
will do the right thing. At this trial, brave women will take the witness stand and the truth will come out: Ghislaine 
Maxwell sexually exploited underage girls. She caused unspeakable harm to vulnerable kids. It is time to hold her 
accountable. 
will open in the morning. Please come support. Details below. Updates to follow. 
Main courtroom: 40 Foley, courtroom 318 
Overflow courtrooms: 110, 506, 905, and 906. There is also a conference room on the first floor (room 130) that has a 
very small monitor with a live feed just for our office. 
Timing: we'll start at 8:30 a.m. with peremptory challenges, and we expect to go straight to preliminary instructions and 
opening statements. In order to get a seat, we'd recommend that you go over early.

(Case called) 
THE DEPUTY CLERK: Counsel, please state your name for 
the record. 
MR. 
: 
Good afternoon, your Honor. For the 
government, 
With us are Special Agent 
of the F.B.I. and 
Detective 
, NYPD task force officer. 
THE COURT: Okay. 
MR. WEINGARTEN: Good afternoon, your Honor. For 
Jeffrey Epstein, Reid Weingarten from the law firm of Steptoe & 
Johnson. 
MR. WEINBERG: Good afternoon, your Honor. Martin 
Weinberg. I'm an attorney from Boston, Massachusetts; and, 
with your Honor's permission, I will be filing a pro hac vice 
to represent Mr. Epstein. 
THE COURT: Okay. 
MR. FERNICH: Good afternoon, your Honor. Marc 
Fernich, New York, New York, also for Mr. Epstein. 
THE COURT: All right. I have spoken to Judge Berman. 
The matter has been referred to me for the initial appearance, 
arraignment, and bail. 
Mr. Epstein, my name is Magistrate Judge Pitman. The 
purpose of this proceeding is to inform you of certain rights 
that you have, to inform you of the charges against you, to 
consider whether counsel should be appointed for you, and to 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00015662
--- PAGE 3 ---
j782epsC kjc 
decide under what conditions, if any, you should be released. 
Can I have the date and time of arrest, please? 
MR. 
: Yes, your Honor. The defendant was 
arrested on Saturday, July 6, at approximately 5:30 p.m. 
THE COURT: Thank you. 
Mr. Epstein, you have the right to remain silent. You 
are not required to make any statements. Even if you have made 
any statements to the authorities, you need not make any 
further statements. Anything you do say can be used against 
you. 
You have the right to be released, either 
conditionally or unconditionally, pending trial unless I find 
that there are no conditions or combination of conditions that 
would reasonably assure your presence in court and the safety 
of the community. 
You have the right to be represented by counsel during 
all court proceedings, including this one, and during all 
questioning by the authorities. If you cannot afford an 
attorney, I will appoint one to represent you. 
It is my understanding that you are being represented 
by retained counsel. I want to advise you that the right to 
the appointment of counsel is an ongoing right that you possess 
throughout these proceedings. If at any time you are unable to 
continue with retained counsel for financial reasons, you can 
apply to the court at any time for the appointment of counsel. 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00015663
--- PAGE 4 ---
j782epsC kjc 
Do you understand that? 
THE DEFENDANT: Yes, your Honor. 
THE COURT: Mr. Epstein, you are charged in an 
indictment in two counts. 
Count One charges you with a sex trafficking 
conspiracy in violation of Title 18 United States Code § 371. 
Count Two charges with you with the substantive 
offense of sex trafficking in violation of Title 18 United 
States Code § 1591. 
Mr. Weingarten, are you going to be lead counsel here 
today? 
MR. WEINGARTEN: Yes, your Honor. 
THE COURT: Mr. Weingarten, have you received a copy 
of the indictment? 
MR. WEINGARTEN: Yes, your Honor. 
THE COURT: Have you reviewed it with your client? 
MR. WEINGARTEN: Yes, your Honor. 
THE COURT: Do you waive its reading? 
MR. WEINGARTEN: Yes, your Honor. 
THE COURT: Mr. Epstein, how do you plead? 
THE DEFENDANT: Not guilty, your Honor. 
THE COURT: Because the defendant has been indicted, 
there will be no preliminary hearing, and that takes us to the 
question of bail. In that regard, I have received the Pretrial 
Services report. I have also received a letter from the 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00015664
--- PAGE 5 ---
j782epsC kjc 
government dated July 8, 2019. 
I take it all counsel have the same documents? 
MR. WEINGARTEN: Yes, your Honor. 
THE COURT: I will hear from the government first, and 
then I will hear from defense counsel. 
MR. 
: Yes, your Honor. 
The government intends to seek detention, and I am 
happy to explain the reasons why. Would the court prefer that 
i speak from the table or from the podium? 
THE COURT: Whatever your pleasure is. 
MR. 
: Your Honor, the defendant poses an 
extraordinary risk of flight and danger presented by him. 
Given the charges and the characteristics of the defendant, he 
simply cannot reasonably be expected to appear in court if he 
is granted bail. Accordingly, the government joins the 
recommendation of Pretrial Services that the defendant be 
detained pending trial for a number of reasons. 
Starting with the conduct alleged, the defendant is 
charged with trafficking minors for sex acts, as the court 
explained, in violation of 18 United States Code E. 591, and is 
charged with a count of conspiracy to traffic minors for sex 
acts in violation of 18 U.S.C. 371. 
In particular, the indictment charges that the 
defendant engaged in a years-long scheme to sexually abuse 
underage girls, paying minor girls to themselves be abused, and 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00015665
--- PAGE 6 ---
j782epsC kjc 
also paying certain victims to recruit other girls to be 
subject to the defendant's sexual abuse. 
The indictment alleges that the defendant undertook 
this conduct at at least two locations, including his mansion 
in Manhattan and his estate in Palm Beach, Florida. In both 
locations, victims were initially recruited to provide massages 
to the defendant, which would be performed nude or partially 
nude, would become increasingly sexual in nature, and would 
typically include one or more sex acts, including...1.MM.= 
These victims, who were often 
particularly vulnerable, were as young as 14, and the defendant 
knew he was abusing underage girls. The indictment further 
alleges that the defendant perpetrated these crimes by working 
with others, including employees and associates who facilitated 
these abusive encounters. 
Regarding the defendant himself, your Honor, he is 
extraordinarily wealthy, mobile, and unattached to the Southern 
District of New York. He maintains at least six residences in 
the United States and abroad, including the ownership of a 
private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands and a residence in 
Paris, France. Among other things, the defendant owns two 
private jets and routinely uses them to travel abroad. He is a 
man of nearly infinite means, your Honor; and, as set forth in 
our submission, he has tremendous incentives to use those means 
to flee prosecution. 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00015666
--- PAGE 7 ---
j782epsC kjc 
The government notes as an initial matter that this is 
a presumption case because sex trafficking is charged; and, 
moreover, each of the four factors to be considered in the 
detention analysis strongly militates towards pretrial 
detention. 
So starting with the nature and seriousness of the 
offense, as previously discussed, the nature and circumstances 
of the crime are the most serious crime that this court sees. 
The defendant is alleged to have spent years sexually abusing 
minors in multiple locations and with dozens of victims. 
The seriousness of the charge is also reflected in the 
potential penalties, which include up to 45 combined years of 
incarceration on Counts One and Two, and the likelihood of a 
substantial period of incarceration is supported by the fact 
that the government's evidence is strong. There are multiple 
individual identified victims in the indictment, numerous 
specified overt acts, and dozens of overall victims alleged. 
In order to protect the privacy of the victims, your 
Honor, I'm not going to go into detail about particular 
victims, but we can say that information provided by victims 
has been detailed, it has been credible, and it has been 
corroborated by other witnesses and contemporaneous documents 
and records, including from a recent search of the defendant's 
Manhattan mansion, as I will discuss further in a moment. 
Separately, your Honor, in just the last 36 hours, 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00015667
--- PAGE 8 ---
j782epsC kjc 
that is, post charge, we have been contacted by multiple 
attorneys and several additional individuals who have 
identified themselves as victims and are interested in speaking 
with the government, none of whom the government has previously 
spoken with. 
Your Honor, the defendant is 66 years old. He is 
charged with appalling crimes, and those charges are supported 
by significant evidence, including victim and witness testimony 
and damning record evidence. He faces the very real prospect 
of spending the rest of his life in prison. He has every 
motivation in the world to flee, and he has the means to do it. 
And I will note for the court that this is a case 
where the government has really put its money where its mouth 
is on the risk of flight. This district took extraordinary 
efforts to maintain the covert status of its investigation for 
many months due to the risk of flight of the defendant -- not a 
single media report, not a single public statement, no appeals 
for victims to come forward because of precisely the flight 
risks we are discussing now. 
Turning to the characteristics of the defendant, your 
Honor, some individuals who face significant charges lack the 
means to flee. Not this defendant. As set forth in the 
government's submission, in the defendant's most recent sex 
offender registration, he lists six residences worth tens or 
hundreds of millions of dollars, including a residence abroad. 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00015668
--- PAGE 9 ---
j782epsC kjc 
The defendant has refused to answer any questions 
about his income or assets for the Pretrial Services report, so 
the scope of his wealth and his assets remains entirely 
concealed to the government and to the court. But the 
defendant certainly has access to endless means to flee, 
including two private jets. He has no meaningful family ties, 
and any argument that his properties would keep him in the 
United States ignores his ability to simply leave those 
properties behind in favor of moving beyond the reach of U.S. 
authorities to live off his extensive wealth abroad, extensive 
wealth, I should add, that the court doesn't even have any 
accounting of. He travels abroad extensively, has a residence 
in France, and all of those factors further contribute to the 
risk of flight. 
With respect to danger and obstruction, again, this is 
a presumption case, and not only is the defendant charged with 
the sexual abuse of minors, he has previously pled guilty to 
solicitation of an underage girl. This court knows that 
defendants are routinely detained in this district when facing 
such charges and that this is not an unusual position for the 
government to take. 
It is further concerning that there are credible 
allegations from the prior investigation that the defendant or 
his agents engaged in witness tampering and harassment, and in 
fact there is evidence that he was contemplating pleading 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00015669
--- PAGE 10 ---
IC 
j782epsC kjc 
guilty to that kind of offense in Florida. Those allegations 
include verbal harassment, evasion of legal process, and 
forcing off the road the father of an individual relevant to 
that investigation. 
THE COURT: Can you elaborate on that last point about 
forcing somebody off the road? 
MR. 
: Your Honor, what we have is the 
record evidence from an underlying civil dispute in Florida 
that discusses this incident and discusses it in the context of 
a potential plea of the defendant to obstruction or harassment 
charges. The government sets before this court that if the 
defendant was willing to undertake such measure simply as a 
result of an investigation, the potential for dangerous and 
obstructive activity in an indicted case is alarming and very 
real. 
Despite having been previously convicted of a sex 
offense involving an underage victim and being a registered sex 
offender, the defendant has continued to maintain a vast trove 
of lewd photography of young-looking women or girls at his 
mansion. Your Honor, pursuant to judicially authorized 
warrants, law enforcement agents searched his home on Saturday 
and found at least hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of sexually 
suggestive photographs of nude females, many of whom appear to 
be underage. 
I also want to note that the search revealed specific

j782epsC kjc 
evidence from his home consistent with victim accounts. Ever 
the room where the abuse occurred, your Honor, the massage 
room, was still set up in the same way it was 15 years ago, 
with a massage table and sex paraphernalia. 
And with respect to the photographs 
THE COURT: When you say the evidence was consistent 
with victim accounts, is it limited to the massage table and 
massage room or is there something else? 
MR. 
: Descriptions of the massage room and 
the massage table, that's correct, your Honor. 
THE COURT: Okay. All right. 
MR. 
: With respect to the photographs, your 
Honor, some of those were found in a locked safe which also 
held electronic disks with labels that included the words 
"Young Miscellaneous Nudes 1" and "Girl Pics Nude." 
Your Honor, this is not an individual who has left his 
past behind. He is a continuing danger to the community and an 
extraordinary risk of flight and, for those reasons, the 
government joins the pretrial recommendation that the defendant 
be detained pending trial. 
THE COURT: All right. Thank you. 
Mr. Weingarten. 
MR. WEINGARTEN: Thank you, your Honor. I will use 
the podium, if that's okay. 
THE COURT: That's fine. 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00015671
--- PAGE 12 ---
j782epsC kjc 
MR. WEINGARTEN: So your Honor, I would like to start 
by providing some context, and then I'm going to make a 
suggestion as to how we proceed. 
The beginning here is 2005 in Florida. That's when an 
allegation was received by the local police that Mr. Epstein 
was engaged in sexual conduct for money, prostitution. 
Thereafter, there was a very sophisticated three-year 
investigation by law enforcement, including locals and feds, 
into Mr. Epstein's conduct. Numerous girls were interviewed, 
employees were interviewed, and it is fair to say that a 
significant segment of the law enforcement community in Florida 
thought what we had in hand was simple prostitution. There was 
no coercion. There were no threats. There was no violence. 
And it is also fair to say that a significant portion of the 
law enforcement community in Florida believed that a local 
misdemeanor was the appropriate sanction. 
Now, it is also --
THE COURT: Did you represent Mr. Epstein in the 
Florida investigation? 
MR. WEINGARTEN: No, but I'm familiar with the 
records. 
THE COURT: All right. 
MR. WEINGARTEN: It is also true that there was a 
contrary view largely taken by the feds, and what ensued was a 
complex set of discussions and negotiations and finally an 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00015672
--- PAGE 13 ---
j782epsC kjc 
agreement, an agreement that was consummated and agreed to all 
the way up to main justice at a very, very high level. 
The agreement involved a plea in state court to 
soliciting an underaged girl, which would require registration, 
compensation paid to alleged victims, and an NPA from the feds, 
in other words, a declination by the federal government, an 
agreement that was approved all the way up in main justice and 
it sure seemed like a global solution at the time to everyone 
involved, including my client. 
What happened since then? Mr. Epstein continued a 
life of success, generosity, creativity and, more important, 
law-abiding life from 2008 forward. How do we know? Because 
when you are in registration the way he is, every single night 
his whereabouts are known. There is constant reporting, 
constant monitoring, and absolutely, to our knowledge, no 
complaints by anybody from that moment forward about his 
conduct until we have arrived in court here. 
Now, what has happened in court from that moment? 
There have been lawsuits, many of them ludicrous, dismissed out 
of hand. But when something like this happens, a lot of stuff 
comes out of the woodwork, and there were lawsuits that 
Mr. Epstein settled also in the normal course. 
There was one particular litigation that leads to this 
occasion, and that is, under the Crime Victims Rights Act, that 
act simply says that victims have a right to be consulted by 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00015673
--- PAGE 14 ---
j782epsC kjc 
the United States, and there are alleged victims in this case 
who complain that they were not, and there has been extensive 
litigation in the Southern District of Florida before 
Judge Marra on that very subject. In fact, the judge concluded 
that the prosecutors from the Southern District of Florida did 
not adequately notify some of the victims about the ongoing 
discussions and the consummation of the deal and, in 
particular, the NPA. The United States took the position that 
they had no responsibility to do so, that they had treated the 
victims properly, and that matter continues to this day. 
The consequences of that matter are overwhelming, 
because the judge suggested, I think three times, that the NPA, 
the declination, could be voided. And we think about that for 
a second. So a defendant negotiates what he thinks is a global 
solution with the feds. He does his time --
THE COURT: Does the nonprosecution agreement in 
Florida -- the nonprosecution agreements in the Southern 
District routinely say they are limited to the Southern 
District of New York. 
MR. WEINGARTEN: Obviously --
THE COURT: Is there a similar provision in the 
Florida agreement? 
MR. WEINGARTEN: I don't want to misstate. It is not 
before me. It is obviously going to be an important part of 
the pretrial motions. What is for sure is that there was - 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00015674
--- PAGE 15 ---
j782epsC kjc 
the negotiation with the Southern District included 
negotiations with main justice. What's also true is the 
investigation extended into the Southern District of New York 
and elsewhere in terms of girls being interviewed. 
So obviously your question is relevant and will be 
part of the pretrial litigation for sure. But what matters 
here and for now is there certainly was a belief that there was 
a global solution based upon the facts on the ground. 
THE COURT: Have you seen the Florida nonprosecution 
agreement? 
MR. WEINGARTEN: Yes. 
THE COURT: And --
MR. WEINGARTEN: I don't have it before me. I don't 
want to make a specific representation and not be completely 
accurate. 
THE COURT: Okay. All right. Go ahead. 
MR. WEINGARTEN: The consequences of this are huge in 
that if in fact there is a negotiation with a defendant, the 
defendant does his time, the defendant pays his victim, and the 
defendant spends ten years on the registration list and 
prosecutors don't adequately notify the victims, how in the 
world can that deal be undone? Every prosecutor in the world 
has to oppose that possibility. No defense attorney in their 
right mind would negotiate a deal with that potential 
consequence. 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00015675
--- PAGE 16 ---
j782epsC kjc 
So this is a huge problem for the department and what 
solution ensues, and I suggest the solution that ensued is this 
indictment. To 
The allegations

us, this indictment is essentially a do-over. 
are from 2002 to 2005. This is old stuff. 
stuff. This is the very stuff that was 
the feds in Florida, a sophisticated three-year 
Two of the alleged victims in this indictment 
are from Florida. The indictment here tracks the conduct that 
was investigated in Florida back before the agreement was 
reached. Obviously we need to get discovery to find out just 
how inextricably linked the investigation back in Florida is 
with what's going on here. We do know we are talking about 
ancient conduct. We do know we are talking about facts that 
are from 2002 to 2005, facts that were known to the United 
States prosecutors before they entered into the NPA, the 
declination. This is essentially a redo. That's how it feels 
to us. And if we are correct, that should chill the blood of 
every defense attorney who negotiates a deal with the United 
States. 
In addition, we have 
the central allegation here is 
trafficking, and obviously it is useful and relevant to make 
inquiry as to why the trafficking law was passed. It is to 
cover abhorrent conduct, where 
are fooled, they are forced to 
places, work in brothels where 
young girls are kidnapped, they 
come usually to unfamiliar 
they service 15, 20 guys in a 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00015676
--- PAGE 17 ---
j782epsC kjc 
day. They can't leave or else their families are threatened. 
This is dreadful conduct. 
I remember an occasion when the Attorney General Eric 
Holder and I think Director Comey had a press conference 
establishing this as a law enforcement priority. Every 
sensible person in the world would think that this is the exact 
right thing law enforcement should do. 
This is not this case. There was no violence. There 
was no coercion. There was no intimidation. There is no 
deception. The bottom line, if you take a fair look at the 
facts of this case as alleged and in the record, you may come 
to the conclusion there was prostitution involved and maybe a 
lot of it, but that doesn't mean that the person involved is a 
pedophile, a rapist or, heaven knows, a trafficker. Just --
THE COURT: 
isn't that rape? 
Well, if the women involved were under 18, 
MR. WEINGARTEN: 
THE COURT: 
they not? 
My understanding --
Legally they are incapable of consent, are 
MR. WEINGARTEN: Well, it could be statutory rape. 
But what I am talking about is trafficking and why the 
statute was passed, and obviously the statute was passed to 
protect women from the horrors that occur in such settings, and 
that is light years removed to what happened in this case. 
So what about bond? I would suggest that the 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00015677
--- PAGE 18 ---
j782epsC kjc 
traditional issues that we look at, the issues involved, let's 
start with that, we believe we have extremely powerful motions 
relating to the government seeking two bites at the apple and 
for due process reasons, double jeopardy reasons, we don't 
think that will stand. We also think fundamentally what's at 
issue here is not trafficking. That's not why the statute was 
passed. 
The risk to others, what we have here is at least ten 
years post incarceration in the State of Florida of conduct 
that has never been challenged by anyone until now. The 
registration requirements are onerous. He is under constant 
surveillance. Law enforcement knows, if they choose to look, 
exactly where he is at any time. 
The risk of flight, what is true is from the moment of 
Judge Marra's litigation in the Southern District of Florida, 
the defendant knew that there would be challenges to the NPA. 
From 2013 on, there were representations made in court that 
that challenge was ongoing, and the defendant never sought to 
flee, never anticipated a time when he would flee, continued to 
live his law-abiding life. So the risk of flight, I think, is 
dramatically overstated in the government's presentation. 
I think the traditional remedies that the court finds 
appropriate in case after case -- a large cash bond; passport 
relinquished; waiving extradition; a bracelet on; some form of 
supervision that is adequate to guarantee his appearance, it

j782epsC kjc 
will be child's play to find that; bonds from other people, 
surety bonds from other people. 
Because we have not had an opportunity to see our 
client until today and because we have just received the 
government's submission, what we would like to do is have the 
opportunity to sit down and put together a bail package, a 
coherent bail package in writing and provide it to the court. 
I would point out on the obstruction allegation 
THE COURT: Let me ask you this -- sorry to interrupt 
you -- do you want to adjourn the detention hearing? Under the 
statute, you have up to three days. 
MR. WEINGARTEN: What I would like is to have until 
the end of the week to provide something in writing, a specific 
recommendation in writing. 
THE COURT: So you want to adjourn a determination of 
bail? 
MR. WEINGARTEN: Yes. 
THE COURT: Is there any objection to that from the 
government? The defendant is detained in the interim under 
3142(f). 
MR. WEINGARTEN: Right. 
MR. 
: Your Honor, we certainly don't object 
if the defendant is consenting to detention with leave to make 
a further application. 
I think the government would like at least a brief 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00015679
--- PAGE 20 ---
j782epsC kjc 
opportunity to respond to some of those points, to the extent 
that the defense is arguing that Mr. Epstein should be granted 
bail as a general matter and the court is going to consider 
those arguments. 
THE COURT: Well, the court always considers the 
parties' arguments. 
But let me just come back to Mr. Weingarten for a 
minute. Mr. Weingarten, under the Bail Reform Act you are 
entitled to a continuance of three days, which I guess would 
take us to Thursday. 
MR. WEINGARTEN: Right. 
THE COURT: The other alternative, I guess, if you 
want to de facto extend that three days is consent to detention 
without prejudice. 
MR. WEINGARTEN: We estimated that by Thursday we 
could get you something in writing and then appear back before 
you at your convenience. 
THE COURT: Okay. Do you want to schedule it -- well, 
I think Thursday's proceedings right now would be in front of 
Judge Berman unless he wants to send it back to me for bail, 
but do you want to put this down for detention hearing on 
Thursday? 
MR. WEINGARTEN: Can I make one point that I don't 
want to forget that I think is extremely important? 
THE COURT: Go ahead.

MR. WEINGARTEN: The last thing we did today was 
refuse to answer questions. What we said at Pretrial is heaven 
forbid we make a mistake, and in terms of assets, we wanted to 
be precise. So there was no refusal. There was a request for 
time to supplement. That was accepted. And that's part of the 
reason we want to sit down and make sure we get our information 
correct to provide to the court. 
THE COURT: All right. 
MR. WEINGARTEN: Can I make one other point? 
THE COURT: Sure. 
MR. WEINGARTEN: In terms of the obstruction, I think 
it is such a significant part of our argument that the conduct 
at issue is ancient. It is from 2002 to 2005. So obviously if 
the defendant is a threat to obstruct justice, the court needs 
to take that into account. The allegations raised -- and I 
just read them briefly because we just got the government's 
letter -- relate to negotiations between the feds and the 
defendant. Back when the Southern District of Florida was 
attempting to find an appropriate remedy, there were 
discussions going back and forth: Can we squeeze you into this 
statute? And it didn't work, and it didn't work because there 
is no factual basis. That is the reference to the alleged 
obstruction. Not obstructive acts. Instead, the feds in 
Florida agreed to the plea to the state offense because there 
was no appropriate statute that covered conduct that was 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00015681
--- PAGE 22 ---
j782epsC kjc 
proveable. That is the answer to the obstruction issue. 
THE COURT: All right. So you want to adjourn the 
detention hearing until Thursday? 
MR. WEINGARTEN: Yes. 
THE COURT: All right. Is there any objection to that 
from the government? I think under the statute he is entitled 
to three days. 
MR. 
: That is, of course, fine, your Honor. 
I think we would like just a very brief opportunity to 
respond to some of those arguments so that they don't sort of 
hang with the court for three days unresponded to. 
THE COURT: All right. Go ahead. 
MR. 
: Just very briefly, your Honor, I 
think a lot of that discussion was entirely orthogonal to the 
issues here. 
But just very briefly, with respect to the charges 
here, there is simply no force required for underage victims. 
A grand jury has properly returned an indictment, and these are 
fact issues that are being presented in large part. 
Certainly the concept of child prostitution is, 
frankly, offensive and not recognized in federal law. The idea 
that children can consent to sex and be prostitutes is beyond 
the realm of federal law which contemplates trafficking, which 
is what has been charged here. Mr. Weingarten is free to argue 
to a jury that trafficking minors was only statutory rape or 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00015682
--- PAGE 23 ---
j782epsC kjc 
that those victims weren't treated as badly as the parade of 
horribles he has in mind. But for now the question is whether 
the defendant's attendance can be assured. 
And with respect to the nonprosecution agreement 
THE COURT: I'm not sure I would refer to something as 
only statutory rape. The use of the word "only" before 
"statutory rape" I'm not sure sits well. But go ahead. 
MR. 
: And I agree, your Honor. 
With respect to the actual substance, the Southern 
District of Florida has represented in public filings that the 
nonprosecution agreement was limited to the Southern District 
of Florida, and we can litigate that in a motion to dismiss, 
but it is simply not relevant here. 
With respect to the statute of limitations, 
Mr. Weingarten says that the conduct is old. He did not say 
that that it is beyond the statute of limitations because it is 
not. 
And, finally, it is not the same conduct. Some of the 
conduct overlaps. Some of the conduct does not. And in 
particular, one of the two counts of the indictment is 
predicated exclusively on New York victims. 
So for all of those reasons, we just ask the court to 
consider those responses as it awaits the defendant's filings 
later this week. 
MR. WEINGARTEN: Can I just make one point to clarify?

THE COURT: Go ahead. 
Mr WEINGARTEN: 
senior moment. 
On the statutory rape thing, I had a 
There is no statutory rape because there is no 
penetration, and that is the answer to that question. 
THE COURT: All right. 
We will set this down for a detention hearing on 
Thursday, July 11, for the continuation of the detention 
hearing. Thursday, July 11, at 2 p.m. 
The defendant is detained at least until the 
continuation of the detention hearing pursuant to 18 United 
States Code 3142(f). 
I have been advised by Judge Berman that he wants to 
see counsel right after these proceedings. Judge Berman's 
courtroom is 17B. So counsel and Mr. Epstein should go to 17B. 
All right. Anything else from the government? 
MR. 
: Your Honor, ordinarily we would ask 
to exclude speedy trial time, but I think because we are going 
directly to Judge Berman, we have no such application. 
THE COURT: Mr. Weingarten, anything else? 
MR. WEINGARTEN: No, thank you, your Honor. 
THE COURT: Mr. Weingarten, anything else? 
MR. WEINGARTEN: No, your Honor. 
THE COURT: All right. Thank you all.

MARCH 3, 2020 
OPEN LE 
ER TO WILLIAM BARR -ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES 
RE: Crimes Against Humanity taking place against America's seniors under the guise of 
guardianship, a state of Florida sponsored organized crime racket. 
Why isn't the Department of Justice "keeping our seniors safe?" 
We are here at great effort and financial hardship to shed light on a government and State of 
Florida sponsored guardian racket. Competent seniors and vulnerable adults with financial assets 
are fraudulently being ruled incompetent by state paid actors in collusion with probate judges, 
attorneys and guardians who ambush these vulnerable adults in their home on the basis of 5 
minute encounters, without physical or medical evaluation. These vulnerable adults are then 
forced into guardianship where they are illegally stripped of their civil rights by judges, attorneys 
and guardians so they can't protect themselves and fight back and then these probate court corrupt 
judges attorneys and guardians seize and steal their estates, their home, car, life savings, 
investments, personal property, retirement accounts, social security, pension, art, jewelry and 
family heirlooms. After all of their assets are stolen, they put these adults on a toxic medication 
such as seroquel to cause their death by sudden cardiac arrest. 
This is a billion dollar racket that enriches a relatively small group of judges, attorneys and 
guardians and deprives the United States of the spending power of millions of American families 
whose assets are embezzled in this criminal enterprise. This tramples any concept of "making 
America great again." 
The so called "court proceeding" is really an organized crime racket run through the court. The 
capturing of vulnerable adults in guardianship has been widely exposed in the media as a form of 
human trafficking. 
Why is the F.B.I. and the Department of Justice allowing this racketeering enterprise to operate 
out of the courts? 
You are making a presentation about marketing and other scams against seniors and completely 
ignoring the REAL DANGER AND THREAT TO THESE VULNERABLE ADULTS by the 
Florida sponsored guardian court racket. 
Those of us in attendance have collectively and individually filed thousands of criminal 
complaints with you personally and your predecessors. 
Thus your office, the Department of 
Justice is well aware of this criminal racket. Ashley Moody, Ron DeSantis and former governors 
and attorneys generals and the State of Florida are intimately aware of this racket as they sponsor, 
financially support and cover up this racket through their many collusive agencies in the state of 
Florida including the "Office of Professional Guardianship" and the law enforcement arm of the 
state of Florida, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. Moreover, when we futilely 
attempt remedy by suing these guardian judges as we have no other remedy, instead of being 
investigated by Ashley Moody, they are represented by none other than Ashley Moody's office. 
EFTA00015687
--- PAGE 2 ---
So far from "keeping our seniors safe" the state of Florida and the federal government are 
subjecting them to horrors. 
The monumental corruption and infestation of this organized crime racket into every level of 
government in the state of Florida is epitomized by the ghoulish finding of nine dead bodies in 
urns in the office of a prolific human trafficker and serial killer who operates under the title of 
"guardian". What is being done? NOTHING. Why? Because she is being purported investigate 
by the collusive cover up arm of the state of the Florida, the FDLE. Why isn't the attorney 
general of the Department of Justice investigating the serial murder of 9 vulnerable adults? She 
has been left unleashed on the public after payment of an insulting miniscule $22,000 bail. 
Moreover, these serial deaths are being portrayed by the state of Florida as the acts of a solo, 
lowly "guardian" This serial killing is not the result of murder by a solo, lowly predator 
guardian; the kingpins of this serial killing/ extortion/human trafficking racket are state of 
Florida color of law judges. This organized crime racket is being run by a terror type 
network of so called "guardian judges, attorney and guardians throughout the state of 
Florida and is being covered up and protected by Florida's attorney general. governor and 
law enforcement. 
Those of us who are here, myself included are children of these vulnerable adults and we have 
watched in horror as our parent and other loved ones are murdered by the probate court racket. 
In response to our thousands of complaint, you have ignored our pleas to not only "keep our 
seniors safe" but to keep our seniors alive and from being human trafficked, murdered and 
embezzled. You have done nothing. That is tantamount to collusion. 
The failure by the Department of Justice to keep our seniors safe is also a failure by the DOJ to 
keep us, their family members safe. We, the family members who expose this crime are viciously 
attacked, stalked, our lives and liberty threatened by the corrupt judges involved. We are 
embroiled in ceaseless litigation orchestrated by these predator attorneys, judges and guardians, 
our assets are seized in fabricated lawsuits orchestrated by these corrupt state actors in collusion 
with corrupt judges in other courts who protect the racket. We are forced into bankruptcy where 
our assets are illegal seized and garnished. Our homes are stolen in foreclosure proceedings. Our 
liberty is threatened. We are illegally stripped of our first amendment rights to free speech by 
illegal gag orders. 
The business of human trafficking, embezzlement and murder for hire is a flourishing business in 
the state of Florida. The state of Florida has a propensity for enabling and covering up all forms 
of human trafficking rackets. Florida's hand slap to Jeffrey Epstein, a serial rapist and human 
trafficker and the resulting cover up inferno been played out on a national stage. 
We wonder - does the corrupt Florida government fear Florida's economic foundation will break 
without this illegal human trafficking empire? This is the reality... by breaking apart and 
eradicating this racket, the government is opening the door to legitimate, productive business that 
will "make America great again". The sponsoring of a human trafficking murder for hire does 
not make America great again. It makes America a barbaric Nazi derived nation. 
EFTA00015688
--- PAGE 3 ---
We are crime victims and whistleblowers. We demand protection by Federal law enforcement. 
We have compiled documents that graphically detail the workings on this crime on a global level 
and how it is carried out against individually our families. 
We want answers and remedy. We want this criminal racket eradicated. We want Federal grand 
juries on a state-wide basis. We want urgent massive criminal investigation and arrests. 
So we ask you Mr. Ban-, attorney general of the United States, what are you going to do to protect 
us and our families and America's seniors and keep us safe? We want to meet with you after this 
presentation and your confirmation to such a meeting.

I thought we should set aside time after the team gets the indictment—the way we gather a team into 
pat on the back after a victory. 
A virtual pat on the back. Via WEBEX 
I want to say: 
office for a 
Congratulations. Great job, 
This was a challenging case to make — to say the least. 
The facts were old and there was that pesky thing called a statute of limitations. 
You worked your way through that to a solution that should win the day, 
You had the challenge of working with victim witnesses whose cooperation and trust you needed to secure. 
You did that with empathy and genuine caring about them and at the same time a dedication to bringing the case against 
Maxwell that is indisputably a worthy case that should have been brought. 
Your legal work was excellent as evidenced by your brilliant pros memos and well drafted indictment. 
So I thank you and commend each of you individually and as a team. 
If I could pass around a celebratory drink I would but instead I will simply ask you to raise a glass tonight with your 
significant other and know that I am also raising one at home for you at the same time.

Justice Department opens probe into Jeffrey Epstein plea deal 
Miami Herald 
By Julie K. Brown 
2/6/19 
The Department of Justice has opened an investigation into Secretary of Labor Alex Acosta's role in negotiating 
a controversial plea deal with a wealthy New York investor accused of molesting more than 100 underage girls in 
Palm Beach. 
The probe is in response to a request by Sen. Ben Sasse, a a Nebraska Republican and member of the Senate 
Judiciary Committee, who raised questions about the case following a series of stories in the Miami Herald. The 
Herald articles detailed how Acosta, then the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida, and other DOJ 
attorneys worked hand-in-hand with defense attorneys to cut a lenient plea deal with multimillionaire Jeffrey 
Epstein in 2008. 
The Herald's three-part series, Perversion of Justice,' was cited by Assistant Attorney General Stephen E. Boyd 
in his letter to Sasse. DOJ's Office of Professional Responsibility will head the investigation, he said. 
"OPR has now opened an investigation into allegations that Department attorneys may have committed 
professional misconduct in the manner in which the Epstein criminal matter was resolved," wrote Boyd in the 
letter dated Wednesday.

This suit arises out of Defendant Maxwell's defamatory statements against 
Plaintiff 
As described below, 
was a victim of sexual trafficking and abuse while 
she was a minor child. Defendant Maxwell not only facilitated that sexual abuse but, most

PARTIES 
6. 
Plaintiff 
is an individual who is a citizen of the State of Colorado. 
7. 
Defendant Maxwell, who is domiciled in the Southern District of New York, is 
not a citizen of the state of Colorado. 
FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 
8. 
became a victim of sex trafficking and repeated sexual abuse 
after being recruited by Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein when 
was under the age 
of eighteen. 
9. 
Between 1999 and 2002, with the assistance and participation of Maxwell, 
Epstein sexually abused 
at numerous locations including his mansions in West Palm 
Beach, Florida, and in this District. Between 2001 and 2007, with the assistance of numerous 
co-conspirators, Epstein abused more than thirty (30) minor underage girls, a fact confirmed by 
state and federal law enforcement. 
10. 
As part of their sex trafficking efforts, Epstein and Maxwell intimidated 
into remaining silent about what had happened to her. 
11. 
In September 2007, Epstein entered into a Non-Prosecution Agreement ("NPA") 
that barred his prosecution for numerous federal sex crimes in the Southern District of Florida. 
12. 
In the NPA, the United States additionally agreed that it would not institute any 
federal criminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein. 
13. 
As a co-conspirator of Epstein, Maxwell was consequently granted immunity in 
the Southern District of Florida through the NPA. 
14. 
Epstein ultimately pled guilty to procuring a minor for prostitution, and is now a 
registered sex offender. 
EFTA00015728

Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1 Filed 09/21/15 Page 4 of 12 
15. 
Rather than confer with the victims about the NPA, the U.S. Attorney's Office 
and Epstein agreed to a "confidentiality" provision in the Agreement barring its disclosure to 
anyone—including Epstein's victims. As a consequence, the victims were not told about the 
NPA. 
16. 
On July 7, 2008, a young woman identified as Jane Doe No. 1, one of Jeffrey 
Epstein's victims (other than 
1, filed a petition to enforce her rights under the Crime 
Victims' Rights Act ("CVRA"), 18 U.S.C. ¶ 3771, alleging that the Government failed to 
provide her the rights promised in the CVRA with regard to the plea arrangement with Epstein. 
The litigation remains ongoing. 
17. 
On or about May 4, 2009, 
identified then as Jane Doe No. 
102—filed a complaint against Jeffrey Epstein in the United States District Court for the 
Southern District of Florida. The complaint included allegations made by 
that pertained 
to Maxwell. 
18. 
In pertinent part, the Jane Doe No. 102 complaint described in detail how 
Maxwell recruited 
(who was then a minor girl) to become a victim of sex trafficking by 
introducing 
to Jeffrey Epstein. With the assistance of Maxwell, Epstein was able to 
sexually abuse 
for years until 
eventually escaped. 
19. 
The Jane Doe No. 102 complaint contained the first public allegations made on 
behalf of 
regarding Maxwell. 
20. 
As civil litigation against Epstein moved forward on behalf of 
and many 
other similarly-situated victims, Maxwell was served with a subpoena for deposition. Her 
testimony was sought concerning her personal knowledge and role in Epstein's abuse of 
and others. 
EFTA00015729
--- PAGE 5 ---
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1 Filed 09/21/15 Page 5 of 12 
21. 
To avoid her deposition, Maxwell claimed that her mother fell deathly ill and that 
consequently she was leaving the United States for London with no plans of ever returning. In 
fact, however, within weeks of using that excuse to avoid testifying, Maxwell had returned to 
New York. 
22. 
In 2011, two FBI agents located 
in Australia—where she had been hiding 
from Epstein and Maxwell for several years—and arranged to meet with her at the U.S. 
Consulate in Sidney. 
provided truthful and accurate information to the FBI about 
Epstein and Maxwell's sexual abuse. 
23. 
Ultimately, as a mother and one of Epstein's many victims, 
believed that 
she should speak out about her sexual abuse experiences in hopes of helping others who had also 
suffered from sexual trafficking and abuse. 
24. 
On December 23, 2014, 
incorporated an organization called Victims 
Refuse Silence, Inc., a Florida not-for-profit corporation. 
25. 
intended Victims Refuse Silence to change and improve the fight against 
sexual abuse and human trafficking. The goal of her organization was, and continues to be, to 
help survivors surmount the shame, silence, and intimidation typically experienced by victims of 
sexual abuse. 
has now dedicated her professional life to helping victims of sex 
trafficking. 
26. 
On December 30, 2014, 
moved to join the on-going litigation previously 
filed by Jane Doe 1 in the Southern District of Florida challenging Epstein's non-prosecution 
agreement by filing her own joinder motion.

Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1 Filed 09/21/15 Page 6 of 12 
27. 
motion described Maxwell's role as one of the main women who 
Epstein used to procure under-aged girls for sexual activities and a primary co-conspirator and 
participant in his sexual abuse and sex trafficking scheme. 
28. 
In January, 2015, Maxwell undertook a concerted and malicious campaign to 
discredit 
and to so damage her reputation that 
factual reporting of what had 
happened to her would not be credited. 
29. 
As part of Maxwell's campaign she directed her agent, Ross Gow, to attack 
honesty and truthfulness and to accuse 
of lying. 
30. 
On or about January 3, 2015, speaking through her authorized agent, Maxwell 
issued an additional false statement to the media and public designed to maliciously discredit 
. That statement contained the following deliberate falsehoods: 
(a) 
That 
sworn allegations "against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue." 
(b) 
That the allegations have been "shown to be untrue." 
(c) 
That 
"claims are obvious lies." 
31. 
Maxwell's January 3, 2015, statement incorporated by reference "Ghislaine 
Maxwell's original response to the lies and defamatory claims remains the same," an earlier 
statement that had falsely described 
factual assertions as "entirely false" and "entirely 
untrue." 
32. 
Maxwell made the same false and defamatory statements as set forth above, in the 
Southern District of New York and elsewhere in a deliberate effort to maliciously discredit 
and silence her efforts to expose sex crimes committed around the world by Maxwell, 
Epstein, and other powerful persons. Maxwell did so with the purpose and effect of having 
EFTA00015731
--- PAGE 7 ---
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1 Filed 09/21/15 Page 7 of 12 
others repeat such false and defamatory statements and thereby further damaged 
reputation. 
33. 
Maxwell made her statements to discredit 
in close consultation with 
Epstein. Maxwell made her statements knowing full well they were false. 
34. 
Maxwell made her statements maliciously as part of an effort to conceal sex 
trafficking crimes committed around the world by Maxwell, Epstein and other powerful persons. 
35. 
Maxwell intended her false and defamatory statements set out above to be 
broadcast around the world and to intimidate and silence 
from making further efforts to 
expose sex crimes committed by Maxwell, Epstein, and other powerful persons. 
36. 
Maxwell intended her false statements to be specific statements of fact, including 
a statement that she had not recruited an underage 
for Epstein's abuse. Maxwell's false 
statements were broadcast around the world and were reasonably understood by those who heard 
them to be specific factual claims by Maxwell that she had not helped Epstein recruit or sexually 
abuse 
and that 
was a liar. 
37. 
On or about January 4, 2015, Maxwell continued her campaign to falsely and 
maliciously discredit 
. When a reporter on a Manhattan street asked Maxwell about 
allegations against Maxwell, she responded by saying: "I am referring to the statement 
that we made." The New York Daily News published a video of this response by Maxwell 
indicating that she made her false statements on East 65'h Street in Manhattan, New York, within 
the Southern District of New York.

COUNT I 
DEFAMATION 
1. 
Plaintiff 
re-alleges paragraphs 1 - 37 as if the same were fully set forth 
herein. Maxwell made her false and defamatory statements deliberately and maliciously with the 
intent to intimidate, discredit and defame 
2. 
In January 2015, and thereafter, Maxwell intentionally and maliciously released to 
the press her false statements about 
in an attempt to destroy 
reputation and 
cause her to lose all credibility in her efforts to help victims of sex trafficking. 
3. 
Maxwell additionally released to the press her false statements with knowledge 
that her words would dilute, discredit and neutralize 
public and private messages to 
sexual abuse victims and ultimately prevent 
from effectively providing assistance and 
advocacy on behalf of other victims of sex trafficking, or to expose her abusers. 
4. 
Using her role as a powerful figure with powerful friends, Maxwell's statements 
were published internationally for the malicious purpose of further damaging a sexual abuse and 
sexual trafficking victim; to destroy 
reputation and credibility; to cause the world to 
disbelieve 
and to destroy 
efforts to use her experience to help others suffering 
as sex trafficking victims. 
5. 
Maxwell, personally and through her authorized agent, Ross Gow, intentionally 
and maliciously made false and damaging statements of fact concerning 
as detailed 
above, in the Southern District of New York and elsewhere. 
6. 
The false statements made by Gow were all made by him as Maxwell's 
authorized agent and were made with direct and actual authority from Maxwell as the principal. 
EFTA00015733
--- PAGE 9 ---
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1 Filed 09/21/15 Page 9 of 12 
7. 
The false statements that Maxwell made personally, and through her authorized 
agent Gow, not only called 
truthfulness and integrity into question, but also exposed 
to public hatred, contempt, ridicule, and disgrace. 
8. 
Maxwell made her false statements knowing full well that they were completely 
false. Accordingly, she made her statements with actual and deliberate malice, the highest 
degree of awareness of falsity. 
9. 
Maxwell's false statements constitute libel, as she knew that they were going to 
be transmitted in writing, widely disseminated on the intemet and in print. Maxwell intended her 
false statements to be published by newspaper and other media outlets internationally, and they 
were, in fact, published globally, including within the Southern District of New York. 
10. 
Maxwell's false statements constitute libel per se inasmuch as they exposed 
to public contempt, ridicule, aversion, and disgrace, and induced an evil opinion of her in 
the minds of right-thinking persons. 
II. 
Maxwell's false statements also constitute libel per se inasmuch as they tended to 
injure 
in her professional capacity as the president of a non-profit corporation designed 
to help victims of sex trafficking, and inasmuch as they destroyed her credibility and reputation 
among members of the community that seeks her help and that she seeks to serve. 
12. 
Maxwell's false statements directly stated and also implied that in speaking out 
against sex trafficking 
acted with fraud, dishonesty, and unfitness for the task. 
Maxwell's false statements directly and indirectly indicate that 
lied about being recruited 
by Maxwell and sexually abused by Epstein and Maxwell. Maxwell's false statements were 
reasonably understood by many persons who read her statements as conveying that specific 
intention and meaning. 
EFTA00015734
--- PAGE 10 ---
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1 Filed 09/21/15 Page 10 of 12 
13. 
Maxwell's false statements were reasonably understood by many persons who 
read those statements as making specific factual claims that 
was lying about specific 
facts. 
14. 
Maxwell specifically directed her false statements at 
true public 
description of factual events, and many persons who read Maxwell's statements reasonably 
understood that those statements referred directly to 
account of her life as a young 
teenager with Maxwell and Epstein. 
15. 
Maxwell intended her false statements to be widely published and disseminated 
on television, through newspapers, by word of mouth and on the intemet. As intended by 
Maxwell, her statements were published and disseminated around the world. 
16. 
Maxwell coordinated her false statements with other media efforts made by 
Epstein and other powerful persons acting as Epstein's representatives and surrogates. Maxwell 
made and coordinated her statements in the Southern District of New York and elsewhere with 
the specific intent to amplify the defamatory effect those statements would have on 
reputation and credibility. 
17. 
Maxwell made her false statements both directly and through agents who, with 
her general and specific authorization, adopted, distributed, and published the false statements on 
Maxwell's behalf. In addition, Maxwell and her authorized agents made false statements in 
reckless disregard of their truth or falsity and with malicious intent to destroy 
reputation and credibility; to prevent her from further disseminating her life story; and to cause 
persons hearing or reading 
descriptions of truthful facts to disbelieve her entirely. 
Maxwell made her false statements wantonly and with the specific intent to maliciously damage 
good name and reputation in a way that would destroy her efforts to administer her 
EFTA00015735
--- PAGE 11 ---
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1 Filed 09/21/15 Page 11 of 12 
non-profit foundation, or share her life story, and thereby help others who have suffered from 
sexual abuse. 
18. 
As a result of Maxwell's campaign to spread false, discrediting and defamatory 
statements about 
suffered substantial damages in an amount to be proven at trial. 
19. 
Maxwell's false statements have caused, and continue to cause, 
economic 
damage, psychological pain and suffering, mental anguish and emotional distress, and other 
direct and consequential damages and losses. 
20. 
Maxwell's campaign to spread her false statements internationally was unusual 
and particularly egregious conduct. Maxwell sexually abused 
and helped Epstein to 
sexually abuse 
and then, in order to avoid having these crimes discovered, Maxwell 
wantonly and maliciously set out to falsely accuse, defame, and discredit 
. In so doing, 
Maxwell's efforts constituted a public wrong by deterring, damaging, and setting back 
efforts to help victims of sex trafficking. Accordingly, this is a case in which exemplary and 
punitive damages are appropriate. 
21. 
Punitive and exemplary damages are necessary in this case to deter Maxwell and 
others from wantonly and maliciously using a campaign of lies to discredit 
and other 
victims of sex trafficking. 
PRAYER FOR RELIEF 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff 
respectfully requests judgment against Defendant 
Maxwell, awarding compensatory, consequential, exemplary, and punitive damages in an 
amount to be determined at trial, but in excess of the $75,000 jurisdictional requirement; costs of 
suit; attorneys' fees; and such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.

Good morning, 
Attached please find the revised spreadsheets, which reflect designations under the Protective Order for the three mini-
VHS tapes that I referenced below. 
I learned this morning that the Marshals intend to bring Ms. Maxwell back to the MDC each review day at 4:30pm. So we 
can plan for the review to take place at 500 Pearl Street from 9:30am to 4:30pm each day beginning on April 13th.

Good evening, 
Today, the Marshals confirmed that they will produce Ms. Maxwell to 500 Pearl Street on April 13, 2021 and every day 
thereafter until the evidence review is complete. My understanding is that Ms. Maxwell should arrive to 500 Pearl Street 
at approximately 9:30am each morning. So we are confirmed for evidence review in the proffer rooms on the 5th floor of 
the 500 Pearl Street courthouse beginning at 9:30am on April 13th. I will plan to be present and to continue assisting with 
logistics. If any questions or concerns arise, please feel free to call my cellphone at 347-344-8771. 
EFTA00015738
--- PAGE 2 ---
To assist in preparing for this review, attached please find annotated versions of the three evidence spreadsheets I 
previously emailed to you: (1) a spreadsheet of New York evidence; (2) a spreadsheet of Florida evidence; and (3) a more 
detailed spreadsheet of the sub-items contained in the Florida evidence spreadsheet. A couple things to note: 
• These spreadsheets now indicate the Protective Order designation, if any, for each item to be reviewed. As you will 
see, there are three mini-VHS tapes that I need to double check before assigning a final designation. I expect to be 
able to access a mini-VHS cassette player later this week, at which point I will be able to provide an updated 
spreadsheet with a confirmed designation for those three items. Additionally, please note that there is one item 
about which we plan to provide you with a letter later this week. 
• These spreadsheets also indicate where each item will be made available for the defense to review. As you will see, 
we have now learned that one item (consisting of shredded paper) is currently at FBI headquarters and will not be 
available for review next week. Please let me know if you believe you need to review that item, and I will inquire as 
to whether and how it can be relocated to New York. Additionally, all 1D items consist of electronic data (as 
opposed to 1B items, which are physical items). As is noted in the spreadsheets, the electronic data that constitute 
the 1D items in this case have either already been produced to you in discovery (e.g., pen register data, GPS data, 
and aerial footage), or are digital recordings of interviews that will be produced as non-testifying witness 
statements. Because these 1D items are data files stored in the FBI system, there is no corresponding physical item 
to produce for you to review. 
Please let me know when you would like to schedule a time for a smaller group from the defense team to review evidence 
at the Bronx warehouse.

Laura, 
Thank you for your email and for your understanding as we work through the logistics of arranging this review. Your 
modifications and clarifications are acceptable to us. Below I address each specifically: 
• The FBI can arrange for a lawyer, investigator, and paralegal to inspect and photograph the precluded items at the 
Bronx warehouse either next week or the week after. Please let us know what day you would like to arrange for 
that inspection, and I will coordinate with the FBI accordingly. I would suggest trying to schedule this visit early 
next week if possible so that if there are items that you believe need to be produced to 500 Pearl Street, we will 
have time to do so during a subsequent day of review at 500 Pearl if the FBI agrees to transport the item(s). 
EFTA00015739
--- PAGE 3 ---
• Tomorrow, I will send you evidence spreadsheets with annotations of which items the FBI will not be producing to 
500 Pearl Street, and which items we are designating under the Protective Order. Please note that certain items 
will be designated "Confidential," in which case they may be photographed, but the photographs should be treated 
as Confidential under the Protective Order. Other items will be designated "Highly Confidential," in which case they 
may not be photographed, absent specific authorization from an AUSA. I note the possibility of authorization to 
photograph this latter category because some Highly Confidential evidence items include both nude and non-nude 
portions, in which case we would permit photography of the non-nude portions. 
• In light of our decision to produce non-testifying witness statements beginning on April 12, 2021, we are no longer 
segregating any electronic media that contain witness statements during this review. This is because all of the 
witness statements on the electronic media in the FBI's possession are from witnesses whom the Government does 
not expect to call at trial in this case. Please note that we intend to produce digital audio files to you containing the 
contents of the electronic media with these non-testifying witness statements, but you are of course welcome to 
review the original recordings themselves. 
• In terms of space, I have been informed that we will not be permitted to conduct this review in a courtroom and 
will instead be required to do so in the proffer rooms. I have reserved the two largest proffer rooms available at 
500 Pearl. We can use the largest proffer room for evidence review, and the slightly smaller proffer room as a 
private meeting space for the defense team. 
• Confirmed, I will ask the FBI to bring all electronic highly confidential images to 500 Pearl Street, including the 
2,100 that were not previously reviewed and the electronic images that were previously provided for review at the 
MDC. 
• Confirmed, I will ask the FBI to bring the 7 hard-copy highly confidential materials to 500 Pearl Street. 
As I mentioned earlier today in a separate email, the FBI and AUSAs are prepared to facilitate this review beginning April 
13th and continuing every day thereafter until your review is complete. I have also formally requested that the Marshals 
produce Ms. Maxwell to 500 Pearl Street on April 13th and every day thereafter until the review is complete. The 
Marshals previously confirmed their willingness to produce Ms. Maxwell for such a review in general, but they have not 
yet confirmed their ability to do so on any particular dates. I will let you know as soon as the Marshals inform me 
whether they can accommodate these specific dates.

Subject: RE: US v. Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes 
Thank you for your email. Your proposal is largely acceptable to us, with the following modifications and clarifications. 
EFTA00015740
--- PAGE 4 ---
• For the items that you propose below to exclude from the evidence transported to 500 Pearl Street (with the 
exception of the cash held at 26 Federal Plaza), we will need to have access for a lawyer, investigator and paralegal 
to inspect and photograph those items at the Bronx warehouse. This seems to include the bulky items, electronic 
devices and "fragile" items. 
o Once they are photographed and shared with the team and our client, we can decide whether a separate 
inspection by our client and/or any expert is necessary at a later time. To be clear, the government's photos 
of these same items are insufficient. 
o If there are any items we are not permitted to photograph (and perhaps you will be able to tell us by April 5 
which those are), we likely will need to have those transported because there is no way for our client to 
inspect the evidence. We can wait to finalize this issue until you have finished deciding what items you 
consider non-photographable, and if we can't agree, then discuss next steps. 
o Please let us know when these "non-transportable" items can be inspected and photographed at the Bronx 
warehouse. It makes sense that it would be done soon so that we can raise any issues as necessary with the 
Court. 
• For playing any of the electronic media, we will obtain the necessary equipment to play at 500 Pearl Street and 
seek permission to bring those devices into the Courthouse. You can segregate out the section of recordings that 
contain "witness statements" and advise us then which ones cannot be played, but we still need to inspect the 
outside of those recordings. 
• As far as space, can you please advise whether the largest proffer room will be available for review of evidence? It 
is my understanding that it can accommodate a large number of the team members at one time. If not, is a locked 
courtroom available for us to review the evidence? The agents could bring out a limited number of boxes at a time 
for inspection. 
• We understand that the evidence will not be taken outside of the monitoring of the agents or your staff and 
appreciate that you will have a separate room for us to consult with our client privately (without the evidence). 
• We understand that all of the highly confidential materials, including not only the 2,100 images not previously 
disclosed as well as the electronic images that were only shown to NY counsel and the client at the MDC, will be 
available for review on a singular laptop at 500 Pearl Street. 
• We also understand the 7 hard-copy highly confidential materials will also be available for inspection at 500 Pearl 
Street. 
Please let me know if you have any questions or disagree with my understanding. If you agree, we can then proceed as 
scheduled on April 12 and continue day to day until we are finished, with a break if necessary for the arraignment.

Counsel, 
Thank you for your email. Below please find our response. If this is acceptable to you, then we will proceed with 
arranging the logistics of having your client produced to 500 Pearl the week of April 12th and the week April 19th. We will 
also arrange for the FBI to transport evidence to 500 Pearl for review the week of April 12th. 
EFTA00015741
--- PAGE 5 ---
Physical Evidence 
• It is not reasonable or feasible to insist that the FBI bring all physical evidence to 500 Pearl Street. That said, we are 
certainly willing to work with you to ensure that your client can review any physical items that are material to the 
preparation of her defense. 
• We would propose excluding the below items from production to 500 Pearl: 
o We appreciate your note that the massage tables are not needed, which will certainly help with the logistics 
of transport. 
o We also appreciate your indication that the cash items from 26 Federal Plaza do not need to be produced. 
Those are the only items not located in the Bronx warehouse. 
o The FBI has seized dozens of electronic devices, including desktop computers, servers, and laptops, from 
Jeffrey Epstein's residences in 2019. Photographs of those devices were produced in our August 2020 
productions as part of the search warrant photographs, and you have received copies of the data that was 
seized from those devices pursuant to a warrant. The production of these devices would be very 
cumbersome, and we do not see any value in looking at an electronic device that cannot be turned on. 
o The framed pictures are bulky and cumbersome to transport. These are also very delicate and are difficult 
to transport. Photographs of those seized images were already provided to you as part of the photographs 
from the searches of Epstein's residences. 
o Certain items seized from the New York residence are bulky, fragile, and/or difficult to transport. These 
include plaster busts of female torsos and a stuffed dog. Photographs of these items were already provided 
to you from the search of the New York residence. 
• The remaining physical items of evidence would fit into approximately 15 to 20 boxes. The FBI has indicated that it 
would be feasible to transport those boxes to 500 Pearl Street. 
• Regarding your request for equipment that can play the recordings, we believe they would require a VCR, a cassette 
player, a CD player, an adapter for a micro VHS tape, and a microcassette player. If you wish to play these 
recordings at 500 Pearl, you will need to provide that equipment. We have asked the FBI whether any other 
equipment would be necessary and will let you know if that is the case prior to the date of your review. It is our 
understanding that any recordings that are not witness statements and that are not highly confidential have been 
produced to you in discovery. We are not aware of any discoverable, non-highly confidential, recordings that were 
not produced to you as part of the Government's discovery productions in the fall. To confirm that understanding, 
we are working with the FBI to physically doublecheck each recording. If we identify any discoverable recordings 
that have not already been produced, we will promptly provide them to you. 
• The segregation of highly confidential material will require the FBI and an AUSA to physically review each item to 
confirm the item's status. We will endeavor to do so by your requested date of April 5, 2021. 
• We can confirm that neither the AUSA(s) nor the agent(s) will record or attempt to record any part of the evidence 
review or conversations among the defense team or with the defendant during this review. Although the evidence 
cannot be left outside of the presence of an agent, we will ensure that a room is available for the defense team and 
the defendant to confer privately away from the agent(s) and the AUSA(s) without monitoring. 
• As for your request for a space large enough to fit 8 members of the defense team, the defendant, an agent, an 
AUSA, and the evidence, my office cannot control the space that the Marshals allow us to use at 500 Pearl outside 
of the proffer rooms. We will certainly request as large a space as possible, but if we are required to use the 
proffer rooms, then members of the defense team may need to rotate in and out of the room. I know members of 
the defense team have been in those proffer rooms before, and they can hopefully provide some thoughts on how 
we might use the proffer room space effectively for your purposes. If the Court grants authorization for the 
defense to bring electronic devices into 500 Pearl, that is certainly fine with the Government, and you may note our 
consent in your request to Judge Nathan for such authorization. 
Highly Confidential Electronic Images 
EFTA00015742
--- PAGE 6 ---
• The 2,100 electronic images were recovered during the responsiveness review of images and videos seized from 
Jeffrey Epstein's devices, which review was not complete until early November 2020. We indicated on page 4 the 
cover letter to our November 9, 2020 production, which included all other images and videos from those devices, 
that "the Federal Bureau of Investigation ('FBI') seized multiple nude and partially nude images from several for the 
above-listed electronic devices. All such images have been designated Highly Confidential. The FBI will make these 
images available for review by the defense upon request." We did not receive a request from the defense to review 
these images until your March 8, 2021 letter, which requested to "view and inspect all materials designated by your 
office as 'Highly Confidential' under the terms of the Protective Order". 
• We did not ask the FBI to bring the 7 hard copy images to the MDC in the fall because we did not understand you to 
be requesting a review of physical, non-electronic evidence during those meetings. Our understanding of the 
defense request at that time was to review the electronic highly confidential images that were recovered from CDs 
from Epstein's residence. We will ensure that the 7 hard copy images are available to you for review at 500 Pearl.

Subject: RE: US v. Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes 
All, 
We have considered your proposal. Unfortunately, it does not permit us an adequate ability to review the evidence in the 
case and does not permit our client to meaningfully participate in her own defense. 
First, we are unable to meaningfully review the evidence without the benefit of our laptops and other electronic devices 
which are needed to take notes of our review. We also need access to our devices during the review to compare the 
physical evidence with the electronic discovery and with our work product. 
Second, we need to provide our client the ability to review all discovery, including any recordings, in order to assist in her 
own defense. Presuming that she will not be taken to the FBI downtown office, then your proposal offers no means by 
which she can both inspect a recording in its physical form and listen to the recording at the same time. 
In order to address the deficiencies in your proposal, we believe the following are necessary: 
Physical Evidence 
• All of the physical evidence currently located in the FBI Bronx warehouse will be transported to 500 Pearl Street 
and made available during the week of April 12, with our client present, in a room sufficiently large to 
accommodate 8 attorneys and investigators. 
EFTA00015743
--- PAGE 7 ---
o We do not need the "bulky" massage tables transported; if there are any other extremely large evidence 
pieces, let us know what they are and we can consider whether we can have someone review and 
photograph those at the Bronx warehouse at an earlier time. 
o From your email, it appears that only two items are not located at the Bronx warehouse — both envelopes 
with cash. Please confirm this. We do not need the two "cash" evidence items transported to 500 Pearl. 
o If there are other evidence items housed somewhere other than the Bronx, please let us know what they are 
and where they are. 
• We will be permitted to bring our laptops, and a camera, into 500 Pearl Street; we are happy to seek permission 
from Judge Nathan to do so. 
• Either the FBI can provide the equipment necessary to listen to any of the recordings at 500 Pearl Street or we can 
bring the necessary equipment. If we are to provide the equipment, we will need to know in advance the formats 
of each recording so that we can be prepared. You can note that on your Excel spreadsheet by the item number by 
March 29 to give us adequate time to secure the necessary equipment. 
• The FBI can segregate any physical evidence that you deem "highly confidential." You can identify any "highly 
confidential" physical evidence items on your Excel spreadsheets by April 5 (one week before the evidence view). If 
we need to photograph or reproduce any such item for expert evaluation, we will seek leave of court. Otherwise, 
we will not photograph any such items during the review during the week of April 12. This will ensure the evidence 
review proceeds smoothly and there will not be any need to ask permission to photograph on an item by item 
basis. 
• The FBI also can segregate any recordings which we will be able to inspect, but not listen to, during the evidence 
view the week of April 12. You can note such designation on your Excel spreadsheet. If we disagree, we can seek 
leave of the Court in advance. 
• We understand that an FBI Agent and/or AUSA may be present during our physical evidence review at 500 Pearl 
Street but of course must ensure that no recordings are made of our conversations and also ensure that there is a 
separate, secure room in which we can confer with our client during the evidence view without monitoring by the 
government. 
• Please confirm whether all electronic recordings (other than the highly-confidential images and videos described 
below) have previously been produced to us, and if not, please explain which ones were not produced by the 
discovery deadlines last fall and why. 
Highly Confidential Electronic Evidence 
• Can you please explain why 2,100 + 7 "highly confidential" images have not been shared with us yet? It was our 
understanding that you previously provided all "highly confidential" images to our client —and to defense counsel —
for review at the MDC in November. We are confused about where these previously undisclosed items were 
located and why they have not yet been made available for inspection and review. 
• During the week of April 19, Ms. Maxwell should be produced to 500 Pearl Street to review (with counsel and a 
defense staff member, on the 1 laptop provided) all of the 5,507 electronic images and video marked "highly 
confidential". These should be segregated into the three categories you describe (never-before produced, 
previously produced, and the 7 hard-copy images). 
Please let us know if you will not agree to any of these steps so that we can address the issues with the Court. 
Thank you.

Subject: RE: US v. Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes 
All, 
Attached please find two spreadsheets documenting all physical evidence in the FBI's custody, as well as a corresponding 
discovery cover letter. We are sending a copy of these files to the MDC for your client as well. 
In response to your questions, the FBI has informed me of the following: 
Regarding the Highly Confidential nude/partially nudge images to be reviewed at 500 Pearl: 
• There are three categories of these images: 
o Approximately 2,100 electronic images and videos seized from Epstein's electronic devices (which have not 
been previously provided to you) 
o Approximately 3,400 electronic images from discs seized from Epstein's residences in 2019 (which have 
previously been provided to you and your client for review at the MDC) 
o Approximately 7 hard copy nude images located in the file from the FBI Florida office's investigation of 
Epstein (which have not been previously provided to you) 
• The FBI will make all three of those categories available to you. The electronic files will be provided on hard drives, 
and the FBI will provide you with the hard copy images for review as well. 
o All electronic images should be viewable as thumbnails, except those seized from Apple devices, which must 
be viewed using Cellebrite. 
o The Cellebrite software will be provided on the drive for your review of images and videos seized from Apple 
devices. 
o The electronic files have the same metadata on the hard drive that was available when the FBI seized each 
image. For images that were carved or deleted, no metadata was recovered, so none is viewable. For all 
other images, the metadata recovered should be viewable on the hard drive. 
o The approximately 2,100 electronic images and videos seized from Epstein's devices are separated by folder 
to indicate which device each image was seized from. 
• Because these images are considered obscene material, the FBI is not permitted to make duplicates of them, and 
there is a limited number of clean laptops on which these images can be reviewed. As a result, the FBI is only able 
to provide a single laptop for review of these images. 
Regarding the physical evidence: 
• Attached are two lists of all physical items in the FBI's custody relating to this case. The first list relates to items 
associated with the FBI Florida office's investigation of Epstein. The second list relates to items associated with the 
FBI New York office's current investigation. 
• The vast majority of physical evidence in the FBI's custody is located at the FBI's warehouse in the Bronx. Two 
items (18 77 & 1B 79) are located at 26 Federal Plaza, but the case agents can check those items out from 26 
Federal Plaza and bring them to the Bronx warehouse on whatever day you choose to conduct your review so that 
you will have all evidence in one place. 
• The FBI is able to arrange for the defense team to review all physical evidence at the Bronx warehouse under the 
following conditions: 
o The warehouse requires at least two weeks' notice in order to pull all of the items for the entire case and 
place them in a location where a large group of people can view them. 
o The warehouse is open during normal business hours between 9am and 5pm on weekdays. 
o At least two FBI agents and an AUSA will be present at the Bronx warehouse to assist and answer questions. 
o The evidence will be placed in a loading dock at the warehouse to provide additional space for the review. 
To ensure that there is sufficient space, please let me know how many members of the defense team intend 
to be physically present for this review. 
o Electronic devices such as cellphones and laptops are not permitted in the warehouse. The defense team 
may bring a digital camera that is not connected to the Internet or a cellular network into the warehouse. If 
the defense team wishes to photograph an item of evidence, the defense will need to inform the agents who 
EFTA00015745
--- PAGE 9 ---
are present, so that they may confirm that the photographed item is not Highly Confidential based on the 
presence of nudity. 
o Electronic media such as VHS tapes, cassette tapes, and CDs will not be playable at the warehouse. 
• To the extent the defense requests that the FBI bring any physical items to 500 Pearl Street for your client to review, 
the FBI is prepared to bring items that are reasonably sized to 500 Pearl Street. With respect to bulky or large 
items, the defense team should be able to photograph those for your client to review, unless they are deemed 
Highly Confidential, in which case the FBI can make arrangements to transport the item to 500 Pearl Street if 
necessary. 
• The FBI is in the process of confirming that it can provide devices to play all of the electronic media in the case in a 
single location at the FBI's offices in downtown Manhattan. We are also double-checking to confirm that all media 
that does not contain witness statements have already been produced to you and your client in discovery. The FBI 
anticipates that we can arrange for you to review all non-witness statement electronic media at the FBI's office in 
downtown Manhattan in approximately three weeks. 
o To the extent you wish to review all of the discs containing photographs, which were seized from Epstein's 
residences in 2019, we note that all of those images have already been produced to you in discovery. For 
your awareness, the FBI has informed me that it took their team several weeks to review all of the images on 
all of those discs. 
Please let me know how you wish to proceed.

Now that the FBI team is back, when do you expect to have answers to all of the questions posed? If I had an idea of 
when you would have answers, it could help me answer your question. 
At a minimum, it would not seem to take too much time to know when someone can open the FBI vault and allow the 
attorneys to make an initial view of the evidence. Also, I understand the FBI did not prepare an inventory of their 
evidence when they seized it from NY and LSJ, so I don't think we need to wait for them to now prepare an inventory 
before we start reviewing evidence. 
Also, when do you believe you will have a response regarding the discovery I requested last Monday? 
Thanks, 
Laura

Counsel, 
The FBI team on this case has been out of the office this week and will not be able to answer all of the questions you 
asked during our Wednesday call until they are back in the office next week. Please let me know if you would like to wait 
until all of those questions can be answered to schedule a day for your client to be brought to 500 Pearl Street to review 
the highly confidential images. My understanding is that the FBI is able to provide at least one laptop containing those 
highly confidential images in time for such a review to take place on Thursday 5/18, but I may not have the answers to all 
of your questions about those images before that date, and I do not know whether you will also be able to visit the 
evidence vault that same week.

That is the only excel spreadsheet indexing physical evidence that we have produced in discovery. That spreadsheet does 
not include every physical item currently in the FBI's custody related to this case. For example, the August 20, 2020 
discovery production also included search warrant returns listing the physical items seized by the FBI's New York Office 
during the 2019 searches of Jeffrey Epstein's residences in New York and the U.5 Virgin Islands (see Bates range 
SDNY_GM_00166007-SDNY_GM_00166043), but they are not contained in a spreadsheet. 
As a courtesy, I have asked the FBI whether it would be possible to provide us with a similar excel index reflecting the 
physical evidence seized by the FBI's New York Office, though it may take some time to compile such an index.

Counsel, 
In advance of our call tomorrow, I wanted to send a copy of the attached index of physical items in FBI custody from the 
FBI-Miami office, which we previously produced to you as part of our August 21, 2020 discovery production. Also 
included in that August 21, 2020 production were scans of numerous items listed on the index. Those scans can be found 
within Bates range SDNY_GM_00172218-SDNY_GM_00173007. It may be useful to reference some of those items during 
our conversation tomorrow, so I wanted to make sure you were aware of them.
