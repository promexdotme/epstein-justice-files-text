Thanks, 
11am is fine. I don't think we will need more time. If for some reason we need to go back later in the 
week, we can arrange for another trip to finish up.

Chris, 
I am going to be tied up for a bit the morning on the 12th. Would it work on your end to meet at the warehouse at 11am, 
please? The warehouse will be open until 4:30pm, though I'm told I can request additional time in advance if you think 
the review will take more than 5'A hours. 
Also, I am working on gathering information in response to Laura's email and expect to be able to respond to it later this 
evening.

My apologies, I meant to include in my previous email that we could have the Bronx view on Monday April 12. Thank you 
for the logistics. 
Regarding the spreadsheets you provided, I have several issues. 
First, there are a couple of items that you have noted for the Bronx Warehouse but will in fact need to be brought to 500 
Pearl for review because you labeled them as "Highly Confidential" and not "bulky." These appear to include: 
NY Evidence List 
• Items 16127-130 (4 boxes). 
• Item 1B13 (1 box) 
Florida Evidence List 
• Item 1, Subitem 26 — one large framed photo from Master Bedroom. 
Second, with regard to the "Bulky" photos (Florida Items 1, Subitems 8, 15a, 15b and 15c), are we permitted to 
photograph those or not? If not, we will need them transported to 500 Pearl. 
Third, Florida Item 8, Subitem 8, says it is Sixteen DVD-R Discs from PBSO but you do not indicate that we can review 
those. Why? We need to address with the Court promptly any issues related to our request to view all evidence. 
Fourth, Electronic surveillance — Your email yesterday stated that these were all "electronic files" with no corresponding 
physical item. However, for several, the chart indicates "Blu-Ray Disks;" is there a reason we cannot inspect these? 
Another Florida item is listed as "one original recording of an interview dated 4/24/07"; I am suspicious that "one original 
recording of an interview" is not truly only an "electronic" file? I was practicing law in 2007 and do not recall "electronic 
files" being the standard then. Can you please confirm? I know that Chris has written separately about the many files for 
which the metadata has apparently been stripped, so we will have to address purely electronic information at another 
date. 
Shredded Paper — Yes, we need to review that as well. 
"Missing from Assigned Box" items — can you please provide more of an explanation for all "missing items"? 
I will let you know any other issues as I see them. However, now that we have made travel plans in reliance on your 
agreement to produce all evidence items, I am hoping that you can promptly answer these questions so that we can 
resolve any of them as needed this week. 
Thank you,

Hi Laura, 
The Bronx warehouse is located at 2350 Lafayette Ave, Bronx, NY. There is plenty of street parking outside of the 
building. Whatever day you wish to have the review conducted at the warehouse, an AUSA and an agent will meet the 
attorney, investigator, and paralegal at the warehouse to escort them into the building to the evidence review room. The 
AUSA will remain present at the warehouse to answer any questions that may arise. 
The FBI has informed me that they can make the evidence available for review at the warehouse any day next week or the 
week of April 19th. Please just let me know what day you prefer, and we will coordinate with the FBI to arrange for the 
review.

Thank you for the updated spreadsheets and the information regarding the timing of the review at 500 Pearl. 
I believe we will be able to have an attorney, investigator and paralegal present at the Bronx warehouse to take photos of 
the "excluded from transportation" items. Please let us know the particulars for that visit when you have a moment.

Good morning, 
Attached please find the revised spreadsheets, which reflect designations under the Protective Order for the three mini-
VHS tapes that I referenced below. 
I learned this morning that the Marshals intend to bring Ms. Maxwell back to the MDC each review day at 4:30pm. So we 
can plan for the review to take place at 500 Pearl Street from 9:30am to 4:30pm each day beginning on April 13th.

Good evening, 
Today, the Marshals confirmed that they will produce Ms. Maxwell to 500 Pearl Street on April 13, 2021 and every day 
thereafter until the evidence review is complete. My understanding is that Ms. Maxwell should arrive to 500 Pearl Street 
at approximately 9:30am each morning. So we are confirmed for evidence review in the proffer moms on the 5th floor of 
EFTA00015756

the 500 Pearl Street courthouse beginning at 9:30am on April 13th• I will plan to be present and to continue assisting with 
logistics. If any questions or concerns arise, please feel free to call my cellphone at 
To assist in preparing for this review, attached please find annotated versions of the three evidence spreadsheets I 
previously emailed to you: (1) a spreadsheet of New York evidence; (2) a spreadsheet of Florida evidence; and (3) a more 
detailed spreadsheet of the sub-items contained in the Florida evidence spreadsheet. A couple things to note: 
• These spreadsheets now indicate the Protective Order designation, if any, for each item to be reviewed. As you will 
see, there are three mini-VHS tapes that I need to double check before assigning a final designation. I expect to be 
able to access a mini-VHS cassette player later this week, at which point I will be able to provide an updated 
spreadsheet with a confirmed designation for those three items. Additionally, please note that there is one item 
about which we plan to provide you with a letter later this week. 
• These spreadsheets also indicate where each item will be made available for the defense to review. As you will see, 
we have now learned that one item (consisting of shredded paper) is currently at FBI headquarters and will not be 
available for review next week. Please let me know if you believe you need to review that item, and I will inquire as 
to whether and how it can be relocated to New York. Additionally, all 1D items consist of electronic data (as 
opposed to 18 items, which are physical items). As is noted in the spreadsheets, the electronic data that constitute 
the 1D items in this case have either already been produced to you in discovery (e.g., pen register data, GPS data, 
and aerial footage), or are digital recordings of interviews that will be produced as non-testifying witness 
statements. Because these 1D items are data files stored in the FBI system, there is no corresponding physical item 
to produce for you to review. 
Please let me know when you would like to schedule a time for a smaller group from the defense team to review evidence 
at the Bronx warehouse.

Laura, 
Thank you for your email and for your understanding as we work through the logistics of arranging this review. Your 
modifications and clarifications are acceptable to us. Below I address each specifically: 
• The FBI can arrange for a lawyer, investigator, and paralegal to inspect and photograph the precluded items at the 
Bronx warehouse either next week or the week after. Please let us know what day you would like to arrange for 
that inspection, and I will coordinate with the FBI accordingly. I would suggest trying to schedule this visit early 
EFTA00015757
--- PAGE 6 ---
next week if possible so that if there are items that you believe need to be produced to 500 Pearl Street, we will 
have time to do so during a subsequent day of review at 500 Pearl if the FBI agrees to transport the item(s). 
• Tomorrow, I will send you evidence spreadsheets with annotations of which items the FBI will not be producing to 
500 Pearl Street, and which items we are designating under the Protective Order. Please note that certain items 
will be designated "Confidential," in which case they may be photographed, but the photographs should be treated 
as Confidential under the Protective Order. Other items will be designated "Highly Confidential," in which case they 
may not be photographed, absent specific authorization from an AUSA. I note the possibility of authorization to 
photograph this latter category because some Highly Confidential evidence items include both nude and non-nude 
portions, in which case we would permit photography of the non-nude portions. 
• In light of our decision to produce non-testifying witness statements beginning on April 12, 2021, we are no longer 
segregating any electronic media that contain witness statements during this review. This is because all of the 
witness statements on the electronic media in the FBI's possession are from witnesses whom the Government does 
not expect to call at trial in this case. Please note that we intend to produce digital audio files to you containing the 
contents of the electronic media with these non-testifying witness statements, but you are of course welcome to 
review the original recordings themselves. 
• In terms of space, I have been informed that we will not be permitted to conduct this review in a courtroom and 
will instead be required to do so in the proffer rooms. I have reserved the two largest proffer rooms available at 
500 Pearl. We can use the largest proffer room for evidence review, and the slightly smaller proffer room as a 
private meeting space for the defense team. 
• Confirmed, I will ask the FBI to bring all electronic highly confidential images to 500 Pearl Street, including the 
2,100 that were not previously reviewed and the electronic images that were previously provided for review at the 
MDC. 
• Confirmed, I will ask the FBI to bring the 7 hard-copy highly confidential materials to 500 Pearl Street. 
As I mentioned earlier today in a separate email, the FBI and AUSAs are prepared to facilitate this review beginning April 
13th and continuing every day thereafter until your review is complete. I have also formally requested that the Marshals 
produce Ms. Maxwell to 500 Pearl Street on April 13th and every day thereafter until the review is complete. The 
Marshals previously confirmed their willingness to produce Ms. Maxwell for such a review in general, but they have not 
yet confirmed their ability to do so on any particular dates. I will let you know as soon as the Marshals inform me 
whether they can accommodate these specific dates.

Thank you for your email. Your proposal is largely acceptable to us, with the following modifications and clarifications. 
• For the items that you propose below to exclude from the evidence transported to 500 Pearl Street (with the 
exception of the cash held at 26 Federal Plaza), we will need to have access for a lawyer, investigator and paralegal 
to inspect and photograph those items at the Bronx warehouse. This seems to include the bulky items, electronic 
devices and "fragile" items. 
o Once they are photographed and shared with the team and our client, we can decide whether a separate 
inspection by our client and/or any expert is necessary at a later time. To be clear, the government's photos 
of these same items are insufficient. 
o If there are any items we are not permitted to photograph (and perhaps you will be able to tell us by April 5 
which those are), we likely will need to have those transported because there is no way for our client to 
inspect the evidence. We can wait to finalize this issue until you have finished deciding what items you 
consider non-photographable, and if we can't agree, then discuss next steps. 
o Please let us know when these "non-transportable" items can be inspected and photographed at the Bronx 
warehouse. It makes sense that it would be done soon so that we can raise any issues as necessary with the 
Court. 
• For playing any of the electronic media, we will obtain the necessary equipment to play at 500 Pearl Street and 
seek permission to bring those devices into the Courthouse. You can segregate out the section of recordings that 
contain "witness statements" and advise us then which ones cannot be played, but we still need to inspect the 
outside of those recordings. 
• As far as space, can you please advise whether the largest proffer room will be available for review of evidence? It 
is my understanding that it can accommodate a large number of the team members at one time. If not, is a locked 
courtroom available for us to review the evidence? The agents could bring out a limited number of boxes at a time 
for inspection. 
• We understand that the evidence will not be taken outside of the monitoring of the agents or your staff and 
appreciate that you will have a separate room for us to consult with our client privately (without the evidence). 
• We understand that all of the highly confidential materials, including not only the 2,100 images not previously 
disclosed as well as the electronic images that were only shown to NY counsel and the client at the MDC, will be 
available for review on a singular laptop at 500 Pearl Street. 
• We also understand the 7 hard-copy highly confidential materials will also be available for inspection at 500 Pearl 
Street. 
Please let me know if you have any questions or disagree with my understanding. If you agree, we can then proceed as 
scheduled on April 12 and continue day to day until we are finished, with a break if necessary for the arraignment.

Counsel, 
Thank you for your email. Below please find our response. If this is acceptable to you, then we will proceed with 
arranging the logistics of having your client produced to 500 Pearl the week of April 12th and the week April 19th. We will 
EFTA00015759
--- PAGE 8 ---
also arrange for the FBI to transport evidence to 500 Pearl for review the week of April 12th. 
Physical Evidence 
• It is not reasonable or feasible to insist that the FBI bring all physical evidence to 500 Pearl Street. That said, we are 
certainly willing to work with you to ensure that your client can review any physical items that are material to the 
preparation of her defense. 
• We would propose excluding the below items from production to 500 Pearl: 
o We appreciate your note that the massage tables are not needed, which will certainly help with the logistics 
of transport. 
o We also appreciate your indication that the cash items from 26 Federal Plaza do not need to be produced. 
Those are the only items not located in the Bronx warehouse. 
o The FBI has seized dozens of electronic devices, including desktop computers, servers, and laptops, from 
Jeffrey Epstein's residences in 2019. Photographs of those devices were produced in our August 2020 
productions as part of the search warrant photographs, and you have received copies of the data that was 
seized from those devices pursuant to a warrant. The production of these devices would be very 
cumbersome, and we do not see any value in looking at an electronic device that cannot be turned on. 
o The framed pictures are bulky and cumbersome to transport. These are also very delicate and are difficult 
to transport. Photographs of those seized images were already provided to you as part of the photographs 
from the searches of Epstein's residences. 
o Certain items seized from the New York residence are bulky, fragile, and/or difficult to transport. These 
include plaster busts of female torsos and a stuffed dog. Photographs of these items were already provided 
to you from the search of the New York residence. 
• The remaining physical items of evidence would fit into approximately 15 to 20 boxes. The FBI has indicated that it 
would be feasible to transport those boxes to 500 Pearl Street. 
• Regarding your request for equipment that can play the recordings, we believe they would require a VCR, a cassette 
player, a CD player, an adapter for a micro VHS tape, and a microcassette player. If you wish to play these 
recordings at 500 Pearl, you will need to provide that equipment. We have asked the FBI whether any other 
equipment would be necessary and will let you know if that is the case prior to the date of your review. It is our 
understanding that any recordings that are not witness statements and that are not highly confidential have been 
produced to you in discovery. We are not aware of any discoverable, non-highly confidential, recordings that were 
not produced to you as part of the Government's discovery productions in the fall. To confirm that understanding, 
we are working with the FBI to physically doublecheck each recording. If we identify any discoverable recordings 
that have not already been produced, we will promptly provide them to you. 
• The segregation of highly confidential material will require the FBI and an AUSA to physically review each item to 
confirm the item's status. We will endeavor to do so by your requested date of April 5, 2021. 
• We can confirm that neither the AUSA(s) nor the agent(s) will record or attempt to record any part of the evidence 
review or conversations among the defense team or with the defendant during this review. Although the evidence 
cannot be left outside of the presence of an agent, we will ensure that a room is available for the defense team and 
the defendant to confer privately away from the agent(s) and the AUSA(s) without monitoring. 
• As for your request for a space large enough to fit 8 members of the defense team, the defendant, an agent, an 
AUSA, and the evidence, my office cannot control the space that the Marshals allow us to use at 500 Pearl outside 
of the proffer rooms. We will certainly request as large a space as possible, but if we are required to use the 
proffer rooms, then members of the defense team may need to rotate in and out of the room. I know members of 
the defense team have been in those proffer rooms before, and they can hopefully provide some thoughts on how 
we might use the proffer room space effectively for your purposes. If the Court grants authorization for the 
defense to bring electronic devices into 500 Pearl, that is certainly fine with the Government, and you may note our 
consent in your request to Judge Nathan for such authorization. 
EFTA00015760
--- PAGE 9 ---
Highly Confidential Electronic Images 
• The 2,100 electronic images were recovered during the responsiveness review of images and videos seized from 
Jeffrey Epstein's devices, which review was not complete until early November 2020. We indicated on page 4 the 
cover letter to our November 9, 2020 production, which included all other images and videos from those devices, 
that "the Federal Bureau of Investigation ('FBI') seized multiple nude and partially nude images from several for the 
above-listed electronic devices. All such images have been designated Highly Confidential. The FBI will make these 
images available for review by the defense upon request." We did not receive a request from the defense to review 
these images until your March 8, 2021 letter, which requested to "view and inspect all materials designated by your 
office as 'Highly Confidential' under the terms of the Protective Order". 
• We did not ask the FBI to bring the 7 hard copy images to the MDC in the fall because we did not understand you to 
be requesting a review of physical, non-electronic evidence during those meetings. Our understanding of the 
defense request at that time was to review the electronic highly confidential images that were recovered from CDs 
from Epstein's residence. We will ensure that the 7 hard copy images are available to you for review at 500 Pearl.

All, 
We have considered your proposal. Unfortunately, it does not permit us an adequate ability to review the evidence in the 
case and does not permit our client to meaningfully participate in her own defense. 
First, we are unable to meaningfully review the evidence without the benefit of our laptops and other electronic devices 
which are needed to take notes of our review. We also need access to our devices during the review to compare the 
physical evidence with the electronic discovery and with our work product. 
Second, we need to provide our client the ability to review all discovery, including any recordings, in order to assist in her 
own defense. Presuming that she will not be taken to the FBI downtown office, then your proposal offers no means by 
which she can both inspect a recording in its physical form and listen to the recording at the same time. 
In order to address the deficiencies in your proposal, we believe the following are necessary: 
Physical Evidence 
• All of the physical evidence currently located in the FBI Bronx warehouse will be transported to 500 Pearl Street 
and made available during the week of April 12, with our client present, in a room sufficiently large to 
accommodate 8 attorneys and investigators. 
EFTA00015761
--- PAGE 10 ---
o We do not need the "bulky" massage tables transported; if there are any other extremely large evidence 
pieces, let us know what they are and we can consider whether we can have someone review and 
photograph those at the Bronx warehouse at an earlier time. 
o From your email, it appears that only two items are not located at the Bronx warehouse — both envelopes 
with cash. Please confirm this. We do not need the two "cash" evidence items transported to 500 Pearl. 
o If there are other evidence items housed somewhere other than the Bronx, please let us know what they are 
and where they are. 
• We will be permitted to bring our laptops, and a camera, into 500 Pearl Street; we are happy to seek permission 
from Judge Nathan to do so. 
• Either the FBI can provide the equipment necessary to listen to any of the recordings at 500 Pearl Street or we can 
bring the necessary equipment. If we are to provide the equipment, we will need to know in advance the formats 
of each recording so that we can be prepared. You can note that on your Excel spreadsheet by the item number by 
March 29 to give us adequate time to secure the necessary equipment. 
• The FBI can segregate any physical evidence that you deem "highly confidential." You can identify any "highly 
confidential" physical evidence items on your Excel spreadsheets by April 5 (one week before the evidence view). If 
we need to photograph or reproduce any such item for expert evaluation, we will seek leave of court. Otherwise, 
we will not photograph any such items during the review during the week of April 12. This will ensure the evidence 
review proceeds smoothly and there will not be any need to ask permission to photograph on an item by item 
basis. 
• The FBI also can segregate any recordings which we will be able to inspect, but not listen to, during the evidence 
view the week of April 12. You can note such designation on your Excel spreadsheet. If we disagree, we can seek 
leave of the Court in advance. 
• We understand that an FBI Agent and/or AUSA may be present during our physical evidence review at 500 Pearl 
Street but of course must ensure that no recordings are made of our conversations and also ensure that there is a 
separate, secure room in which we can confer with our client during the evidence view without monitoring by the 
government. 
• Please confirm whether all electronic recordings (other than the highly-confidential images and videos described 
below) have previously been produced to us, and if not, please explain which ones were not produced by the 
discovery deadlines last fall and why. 
Highly Confidential Electronic Evidence 
• Can you please explain why 2,100 + 7 "highly confidential" images have not been shared with us yet? It was our 
understanding that you previously provided all "highly confidential" images to our client —and to defense counsel —
for review at the MDC in November. We are confused about where these previously undisclosed items were 
located and why they have not yet been made available for inspection and review. 
• During the week of April 19, Ms. Maxwell should be produced to 500 Pearl Street to review (with counsel and a 
defense staff member, on the 1 laptop provided) all of the 5,507 electronic images and video marked "highly 
confidential". These should be segregated into the three categories you describe (never-before produced, 
previously produced, and the 7 hard-copy images). 
Please let us know if you will not agree to any of these steps so that we can address the issues with the Court. 
Thank you.

Subject: RE: US v. Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes 
All, 
Attached please find two spreadsheets documenting all physical evidence in the FBI's custody, as well as a corresponding 
discovery cover letter. We are sending a copy of these files to the MDC for your client as well. 
In response to your questions, the FBI has informed me of the following: 
Regarding the Highly Confidential nude/partially nudge images to be reviewed at 500 Pearl: 
• There are three categories of these images: 
o Approximately 2,100 electronic images and videos seized from Epstein's electronic devices (which have not 
been previously provided to you) 
o Approximately 3,400 electronic images from discs seized from Epstein's residences in 2019 (which have 
previously been provided to you and your client for review at the MDC) 
o Approximately 7 hard copy nude images located in the file from the FBI Florida office's investigation of 
Epstein (which have not been previously provided to you) 
• The FBI will make all three of those categories available to you. The electronic files will be provided on hard drives, 
and the FBI will provide you with the hard copy images for review as well. 
o All electronic images should be viewable as thumbnails, except those seized from Apple devices, which must 
be viewed using Cellebrite. 
o The Cellebrite software will be provided on the drive for your review of images and videos seized from Apple 
devices. 
o The electronic files have the same metadata on the hard drive that was available when the FBI seized each 
image. For images that were carved or deleted, no metadata was recovered, so none is viewable. For all 
other images, the metadata recovered should be viewable on the hard drive. 
o The approximately 2,100 electronic images and videos seized from Epstein's devices are separated by folder 
to indicate which device each image was seized from. 
• Because these images are considered obscene material, the FBI is not permitted to make duplicates of them, and 
there is a limited number of clean laptops on which these images can be reviewed. As a result, the FBI is only able 
to provide a single laptop for review of these images. 
Regarding the physical evidence: 
• Attached are two lists of all physical items in the FBI's custody relating to this case. The first list relates to items 
associated with the FBI Florida office's investigation of Epstein. The second list relates to items associated with the 
FBI New York office's current investigation. 
• The vast majority of physical evidence in the FBI's custody is located at the FBI's warehouse in the Bronx. Two 
items (18 77 & 1B 79) are located at 26 Federal Plaza, but the case agents can check those items out from 26 
Federal Plaza and bring them to the Bronx warehouse on whatever day you choose to conduct your review so that 
you will have all evidence in one place. 
• The FBI is able to arrange for the defense team to review all physical evidence at the Bronx warehouse under the 
following conditions: 
o The warehouse requires at least two weeks' notice in order to pull all of the items for the entire case and 
place them in a location where a large group of people can view them. 
o The warehouse is open during normal business hours between 9am and 5pm on weekdays. 
o At least two FBI agents and an AUSA will be present at the Bronx warehouse to assist and answer questions. 
o The evidence will be placed in a loading dock at the warehouse to provide additional space for the review. 
To ensure that there is sufficient space, please let me know how many members of the defense team intend 
to be physically present for this review. 
o Electronic devices such as cellphones and laptops are not permitted in the warehouse. The defense team 
may bring a digital camera that is not connected to the Internet or a cellular network into the warehouse. If 
the defense team wishes to photograph an item of evidence, the defense will need to inform the agents who 
EFTA00015763
--- PAGE 12 ---
are present, so that they may confirm that the photographed item is not Highly Confidential based on the 
presence of nudity. 
o Electronic media such as VHS tapes, cassette tapes, and CDs will not be playable at the warehouse. 
• To the extent the defense requests that the FBI bring any physical items to 500 Pearl Street for your client to review, 
the FBI is prepared to bring items that are reasonably sized to 500 Pearl Street. With respect to bulky or large 
items, the defense team should be able to photograph those for your client to review, unless they are deemed 
Highly Confidential, in which case the FBI can make arrangements to transport the item to 500 Pearl Street if 
necessary. 
• The FBI is in the process of confirming that it can provide devices to play all of the electronic media in the case in a 
single location at the FBI's offices in downtown Manhattan. We are also double-checking to confirm that all media 
that does not contain witness statements have already been produced to you and your client in discovery. The FBI 
anticipates that we can arrange for you to review all non-witness statement electronic media at the FBI's office in 
downtown Manhattan in approximately three weeks. 
o To the extent you wish to review all of the discs containing photographs, which were seized from Epstein's 
residences in 2019, we note that all of those images have already been produced to you in discovery. For 
your awareness, the FBI has informed me that it took their team several weeks to review all of the images on 
all of those discs. 
Please let me know how you wish to proceed.

Now that the FBI team is back, when do you expect to have answers to all of the questions posed? If I had an idea of 
when you would have answers, it could help me answer your question. 
At a minimum, it would not seem to take too much time to know when someone can open the FBI vault and allow the 
attorneys to make an initial view of the evidence. Also, I understand the FBI did not prepare an inventory of their 
evidence when they seized it from NY and LSJ, so I don't think we need to wait for them to now prepare an inventory 
before we start reviewing evidence. 
Also, when do you believe you will have a response regarding the discovery I requested last Monday? 
Thanks, 
Laura

Counsel, 
The FBI team on this case has been out of the office this week and will not be able to answer all of the questions you 
asked during our Wednesday call until they are back in the office next week. Please let me know if you would like to wait 
until all of those questions can be answered to schedule a day for your client to be brought to 500 Pearl Street to review 
the highly confidential images. My understanding is that the FBI is able to provide at least one laptop containing those 
highly confidential images in time for such a review to take place on Thursday 5/18, but I may not have the answers to all 
of your questions about those images before that date, and I do not know whether you will also be able to visit the 
evidence vault that same week.

That is the only excel spreadsheet indexing physical evidence that we have produced in discovery. That spreadsheet does 
not include every physical item currently in the FBI's custody related to this case. For example, the August 20, 2020 
discovery production also included search warrant returns listing the physical items seized by the FBI's New York Office 
during the 2019 searches of Jeffrey Epstein's residences in New York and the U.5 Virgin Islands (see Bates range 
SDNY_GM_00166007-SDNY_GM_00166043), but they are not contained in a spreadsheet. 
As a courtesy, I have asked the FBI whether it would be possible to provide us with a similar excel index reflecting the 
physical evidence seized by the FBI's New York Office, though it may take some time to compile such an index.

Counsel, 
In advance of our call tomorrow, I wanted to send a copy of the attached index of physical items in FBI custody from the 
FBI-Miami office, which we previously produced to you as part of our August 21, 2020 discovery production. Also 
included in that August 21, 2020 production were scans of numerous items listed on the index. Those scans can be found 
within Bates range SDNY_GM_00172218-SDNY_GM_00173007. It may be useful to reference some of those items during 
our conversation tomorrow, so I wanted to make sure you were aware of them.

My apologies, I meant to include in my previous email that we could have the Bronx view on Monday April 12. Thank you 
for the logistics. 
Regarding the spreadsheets you provided, I have several issues. 
First, there are a couple of items that you have noted for the Bronx Warehouse but will in fact need to be brought to 500 
Pearl for review because you labeled them as "Highly Confidential" and not "bulky." These appear to include: 
NY Evidence List 
• Items 16127-130 (4 boxes). 
• Item 1B13 (1 box) 
Florida Evidence List 
• Item 1, Subitem 26 — one large framed photo from Master Bedroom. 
Second, with regard to the "Bulky" photos (Florida Items 1, Subitems 8, 15a, 15b and 15c), are we permitted to 
photograph those or not? If not, we will need them transported to 500 Pearl. 
Third, Florida Item 8, Subitem 8, says it is Sixteen DVD-R Discs from PBSO but you do not indicate that we can review 
those. Why? We need to address with the Court promptly any issues related to our request to view all evidence. 
Fourth, Electronic surveillance — Your email yesterday stated that these were all "electronic files" with no corresponding 
physical item. However, for several, the chart indicates "Blu-Ray Disks;" is there a reason we cannot inspect these? 
Another Florida item is listed as "one original recording of an interview dated 4/24/07"; I am suspicious that "one original 
EFTA00015770
--- PAGE 2 ---
recording of an interview" is not truly only an "electronic" file? I was practicing law in 2007 and do not recall "electronic 
files" being the standard then. Can you please confirm? I know that Chris has written separately about the many files for 
which the metadata has apparently been stripped, so we will have to address purely electronic information at another 
date. 
Shredded Paper — Yes, we need to review that as well. 
"Missing from Assigned Box" items — can you please provide more of an explanation for all "missing items"? 
I will let you know any other issues as I see them. However, now that we have made travel plans in reliance on your 
agreement to produce all evidence items, I am hoping that you can promptly answer these questions so that we can 
resolve any of them as needed this week. 
Thank you,

Hi Laura, 
The Bronx warehouse is located at 2350 Lafayette Ave, Bronx, NY. There is plenty of street parking outside of the 
building. Whatever day you wish to have the review conducted at the warehouse, an AUSA and an agent will meet the 
attorney, investigator, and paralegal at the warehouse to escort them into the building to the evidence review room. The 
AUSA will remain present at the warehouse to answer any questions that may arise. 
The FBI has informed me that they can make the evidence available for review at the warehouse any day next week or the 
week of April 19th. Please just let me know what day you prefer, and we will coordinate with the FBI to arrange for the 
review.

VHS tapes that I referenced below. 
I learned this morning that the Marshals intend to bring Ms. Maxwell back to the MDC each review day at 4:30pm. So we

Good evening, 
Today, the Marshals confirmed that they will produce Ms. Maxwell to 500 Pearl Street on April 13, 2021 and every day 
thereafter until the evidence review is complete. My understanding is that Ms. Maxwell should arrive to 500 Pearl Street 
at approximately 9:30am each morning. So we are confirmed for evidence review in the proffer rooms on the 5th floor of 
the 500 Pearl Street courthouse beginning at 9:30am on April 13th. I will plan to be present and to continue assisting with 
logistics. If any questions or concerns arise, please feel free to call my cellphone at 
To assist in preparing for this review, attached please find annotated versions of the three evidence spreadsheets I 
previously emailed to you: (1) a spreadsheet of New York evidence; (2) a spreadsheet of Florida evidence; and (3) a more 
detailed spreadsheet of the sub-items contained in the Florida evidence spreadsheet. A couple things to note: 
• These spreadsheets now indicate the Protective Order designation, if any, for each item to be reviewed. As you will 
see, there are three mini-VHS tapes that I need to double check before assigning a final designation. I expect to be 
able to access a mini-VHS cassette player later this week, at which point I will be able to provide an updated 
spreadsheet with a confirmed designation for those three items. Additionally, please note that there is one item 
about which we plan to provide you with a letter later this week. 
• These spreadsheets also indicate where each item will be made available for the defense to review. As you will see, 
we have now learned that one item (consisting of shredded paper) is currently at FBI headquarters and will not be 
available for review next week. Please let me know if you believe you need to review that item, and I will inquire as 
to whether and how it can be relocated to New York. Additionally, all 1D items consist of electronic data (as 
opposed to 1B items, which are physical items). As is noted in the spreadsheets, the electronic data that constitute 
the 1D items in this case have either already been produced to you in discovery (e.g., pen register data, CPS data, 
and aerial footage), or are digital recordings of interviews that will be produced as non-testifying witness 
statements. Because these 1D items are data files stored in the FBI system, there is no corresponding physical item 
to produce for you to review. 
Please let me know when you would like to schedule a time for a smaller group from the defense team to review evidence 
at the Bronx warehouse.

Subject: RE: US v. Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes 
Laura, 
Thank you for your email and for your understanding as we work through the logistics of arranging this review. Your 
modifications and clarifications are acceptable to us. Below I address each specifically: 
• The FBI can arrange for a lawyer, investigator, and paralegal to inspect and photograph the precluded items at the 
Bronx warehouse either next week or the week after. Please let us know what day you would like to arrange for 
that inspection, and I will coordinate with the FBI accordingly. I would suggest trying to schedule this visit early 
next week if possible so that if there are items that you believe need to be produced to 500 Pearl Street, we will 
have time to do so during a subsequent day of review at 500 Pearl if the FBI agrees to transport the item(s). 
• Tomorrow, I will send you evidence spreadsheets with annotations of which items the FBI will not be producing to 
500 Pearl Street, and which items we are designating under the Protective Order. Please note that certain items 
will be designated "Confidential," in which case they may be photographed, but the photographs should be treated 
as Confidential under the Protective Order. Other items will be designated "Highly Confidential," in which case they 
may not be photographed, absent specific authorization from an AUSA. I note the possibility of authorization to 
photograph this latter category because some Highly Confidential evidence items include both nude and non-nude 
portions, in which case we would permit photography of the non-nude portions. 
• In light of our decision to produce non-testifying witness statements beginning on April 12, 2021, we are no longer 
segregating any electronic media that contain witness statements during this review. This is because all of the 
witness statements on the electronic media in the FBI's possession are from witnesses whom the Government does 
not expect to call at trial in this case. Please note that we intend to produce digital audio files to you containing the 
contents of the electronic media with these non-testifying witness statements, but you are of course welcome to 
review the original recordings themselves. 
• In terms of space, I have been informed that we will not be permitted to conduct this review in a courtroom and 
will instead be required to do so in the proffer rooms. I have reserved the two largest proffer rooms available at 
500 Pearl. We can use the largest proffer room for evidence review, and the slightly smaller proffer room as a 
private meeting space for the defense team. 
• Confirmed, I will ask the FBI to bring all electronic highly confidential images to 500 Pearl Street, including the 
2,100 that were not previously reviewed and the electronic images that were previously provided for review at the 
MDC. 
• Confirmed, I will ask the FBI to bring the 7 hard-copy highly confidential materials to 500 Pearl Street. 
As I mentioned earlier today in a separate email, the FBI and AUSAs are prepared to facilitate this review beginning April 
13th and continuing every day thereafter until your review is complete. I have also formally requested that the Marshals 
produce Ms. Maxwell to 500 Pearl Street on April 13th and every day thereafter until the review is complete. The 
Marshals previously confirmed their willingness to produce Ms. Maxwell for such a review in general, but they have not 
yet confirmed their ability to do so on any particular dates. I will let you know as soon as the Marshals inform me 
whether they can accommodate these specific dates.

Subject: RE: US v. Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes 
Thank you for your email. Your proposal is largely acceptable to us, with the following modifications and clarifications. 
• For the items that you propose below to exclude from the evidence transported to 500 Pearl Street (with the 
exception of the cash held at 26 Federal Plaza), we will need to have access for a lawyer, investigator and paralegal 
to inspect and photograph those items at the Bronx warehouse. This seems to include the bulky items, electronic 
devices and "fragile" items. 
o Once they are photographed and shared with the team and our client, we can decide whether a separate 
inspection by our client and/or any expert is necessary at a later time. To be clear, the government's photos 
of these same items are insufficient. 
o If there are any items we are not permitted to photograph (and perhaps you will be able to tell us by April 5 
which those are), we likely will need to have those transported because there is no way for our client to 
inspect the evidence. We can wait to finalize this issue until you have finished deciding what items you 
consider non-photographable, and if we can't agree, then discuss next steps. 
o Please let us know when these "non-transportable" items can be inspected and photographed at the Bronx 
warehouse. It makes sense that it would be done soon so that we can raise any issues as necessary with the 
Court. 
• For playing any of the electronic media, we will obtain the necessary equipment to play at 500 Pearl Street and 
seek permission to bring those devices into the Courthouse. You can segregate out the section of recordings that 
contain "witness statements" and advise us then which ones cannot be played, but we still need to inspect the 
outside of those recordings. 
• As far as space, can you please advise whether the largest proffer room will be available for review of evidence? It 
is my understanding that it can accommodate a large number of the team members at one time. If not, is a locked 
courtroom available for us to review the evidence? The agents could bring out a limited number of boxes at a time 
for inspection. 
• We understand that the evidence will not be taken outside of the monitoring of the agents or your staff and 
appreciate that you will have a separate room for us to consult with our client privately (without the evidence). 
• We understand that all of the highly confidential materials, including not only the 2,100 images not previously 
disclosed as well as the electronic images that were only shown to NY counsel and the client at the MDC, will be 
available for review on a singular laptop at 500 Pearl Street. 
• We also understand the 7 hard-copy highly confidential materials will also be available for inspection at 500 Pearl 
Street. 
Please let me know if you have any questions or disagree with my understanding. If you agree, we can then proceed as 
scheduled on April 12 and continue day to day until we are finished, with a break if necessary for the arraignment.

< 
Counsel, 
Thank you for your email. Below please find our response. If this is acceptable to you, then we will proceed with 
arranging the logistics of having your client produced to 500 Pearl the week of April 12th and the week April 19th. We will 
also arrange for the FBI to transport evidence to 500 Pearl for review the week of April 12th. 
Physical Evidence 
• It is not reasonable or feasible to insist that the FBI bring all physical evidence to 500 Pearl Street. That said, we are 
certainly willing to work with you to ensure that your client can review any physical items that are material to the 
preparation of her defense. 
• We would propose excluding the below items from production to 500 Pearl: 
o We appreciate your note that the massage tables are not needed, which will certainly help with the logistics 
of transport. 
o We also appreciate your indication that the cash items from 26 Federal Plaza do not need to be produced. 
Those are the only items not located in the Bronx warehouse. 
o The FBI has seized dozens of electronic devices, including desktop computers, servers, and laptops, from 
Jeffrey Epstein's residences in 2019. Photographs of those devices were produced in our August 2020 
productions as part of the search warrant photographs, and you have received copies of the data that was 
seized from those devices pursuant to a warrant. The production of these devices would be very 
cumbersome, and we do not see any value in looking at an electronic device that cannot be turned on. 
o The framed pictures are bulky and cumbersome to transport. These are also very delicate and are difficult 
to transport. Photographs of those seized images were already provided to you as part of the photographs 
from the searches of Epstein's residences. 
o Certain items seized from the New York residence are bulky, fragile, and/or difficult to transport. These 
include plaster busts of female torsos and a stuffed dog. Photographs of these items were already provided 
to you from the search of the New York residence. 
• The remaining physical items of evidence would fit into approximately 15 to 20 boxes. The FBI has indicated that it 
would be feasible to transport those boxes to 500 Pearl Street. 
• Regarding your request for equipment that can play the recordings, we believe they would require a VCR, a cassette 
player, a CD player, an adapter for a micro VHS tape, and a microcassette player. If you wish to play these 
recordings at 500 Pearl, you will need to provide that equipment. We have asked the FBI whether any other 
equipment would be necessary and will let you know if that is the case prior to the date of your review. It is our 
understanding that any recordings that are not witness statements and that are not highly confidential have been 
produced to you in discovery. We are not aware of any discoverable, non-highly confidential, recordings that were 
not produced to you as part of the Government's discovery productions in the fall. To confirm that understanding, 
we are working with the FBI to physically doublecheck each recording. If we identify any discoverable recordings 
that have not already been produced, we will promptly provide them to you. 
• The segregation of highly confidential material will require the FBI and an AUSA to physically review each item to 
confirm the item's status. We will endeavor to do so by your requested date of April 5, 2021. 
EFTA00015776
--- PAGE 8 ---
• We can confirm that neither the AUSA(s) nor the agent(s) will record or attempt to record any part of the evidence 
review or conversations among the defense team or with the defendant during this review. Although the evidence 
cannot be left outside of the presence of an agent, we will ensure that a room is available for the defense team and 
the defendant to confer privately away from the agent(s) and the AUSA(s) without monitoring. 
• As for your request for a space large enough to fit 8 members of the defense team, the defendant, an agent, an 
AUSA, and the evidence, my office cannot control the space that the Marshals allow us to use at 500 Pearl outside 
of the proffer rooms. We will certainly request as large a space as possible, but if we are required to use the 
proffer rooms, then members of the defense team may need to rotate in and out of the room. I know members of 
the defense team have been in those proffer rooms before, and they can hopefully provide some thoughts on how 
we might use the proffer room space effectively for your purposes. If the Court grants authorization for the 
defense to bring electronic devices into 500 Pearl, that is certainly fine with the Government, and you may note our 
consent in your request to Judge Nathan for such authorization. 
Highly Confidential Electronic Images 
. The 2,100 electronic images were recovered during the responsiveness review of images and videos seized from 
Jeffrey Epstein's devices, which review was not complete until early November 2020. We indicated on page 4 the 
cover letter to our November 9, 2020 production, which included all other images and videos from those devices, 
that "the Federal Bureau of Investigation ('FBI') seized multiple nude and partially nude images from several for the 
above-listed electronic devices. All such images have been designated Highly Confidential. The FBI will make these 
images available for review by the defense upon request." We did not receive a request from the defense to review 
these images until your March 8, 2021 letter, which requested to "view and inspect all materials designated by your 
office as 'Highly Confidential' under the terms of the Protective Order". 
• We did not ask the FBI to bring the 7 hard copy images to the MDC in the fall because we did not understand you to 
be requesting a review of physical, non-electronic evidence during those meetings. Our understanding of the 
defense request at that time was to review the electronic highly confidential images that were recovered from CDs 
from Epstein's residence. We will ensure that the 7 hard copy images are available to you for review at 500 Pearl.

Subject: RE: US v. Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes 
All, 
We have considered your proposal. Unfortunately, it does not permit us an adequate ability to review the evidence in the 
case and does not permit our client to meaningfully participate in her own defense. 
EFTA00015777
--- PAGE 9 ---
First, we are unable to meaningfully review the evidence without the benefit of our laptops and other electronic devices 
which are needed to take notes of our review. We also need access to our devices during the review to compare the 
physical evidence with the electronic discovery and with our work product. 
Second, we need to provide our client the ability to review all discovery, including any recordings, in order to assist in her 
own defense. Presuming that she will not be taken to the FBI downtown office, then your proposal offers no means by 
which she can both inspect a recording in its physical form and listen to the recording at the same time. 
In order to address the deficiencies in your proposal, we believe the following are necessary: 
Physical Evidence 
• All of the physical evidence currently located in the FBI Bronx warehouse will be transported to 500 Pearl Street 
and made available during the week of April 12, with our client present, in a room sufficiently large to 
accommodate 8 attorneys and investigators. 
o We do not need the "bulky" massage tables transported; if there are any other extremely large evidence 
pieces, let us know what they are and we can consider whether we can have someone review and 
photograph those at the Bronx warehouse at an earlier time. 
o From your email, it appears that only two items are not located at the Bronx warehouse — both envelopes 
with cash. Please confirm this. We do not need the two "cash" evidence items transported to 500 Pearl. 
o If there are other evidence items housed somewhere other than the Bronx, please let us know what they are 
and where they are. 
• We will be permitted to bring our laptops, and a camera, into 500 Pearl Street; we are happy to seek permission 
from Judge Nathan to do so. 
• Either the FBI can provide the equipment necessary to listen to any of the recordings at 500 Pearl Street or we can 
bring the necessary equipment. If we are to provide the equipment, we will need to know in advance the formats 
of each recording so that we can be prepared. You can note that on your Excel spreadsheet by the item number by 
March 29 to give us adequate time to secure the necessary equipment. 
• The FBI can segregate any physical evidence that you deem "highly confidential." You can identify any "highly 
confidential" physical evidence items on your Excel spreadsheets by April 5 (one week before the evidence view). If 
we need to photograph or reproduce any such item for expert evaluation, we will seek leave of court. Otherwise, 
we will not photograph any such items during the review during the week of April 12. This will ensure the evidence 
review proceeds smoothly and there will not be any need to ask permission to photograph on an item by item 
basis. 
• The FBI also can segregate any recordings which we will be able to inspect, but not listen to, during the evidence 
view the week of April 12. You can note such designation on your Excel spreadsheet. If we disagree, we can seek 
leave of the Court in advance. 
• We understand that an FBI Agent and/or AUSA may be present during our physical evidence review at 500 Pearl 
Street but of course must ensure that no recordings are made of our conversations and also ensure that there is a 
separate, secure room in which we can confer with our client during the evidence view without monitoring by the 
government. 
• Please confirm whether all electronic recordings (other than the highly-confidential images and videos described 
below) have previously been produced to us, and if not, please explain which ones were not produced by the 
discovery deadlines last fall and why. 
Highly Confidential Electronic Evidence 
• Can you please explain why 2,100 + 7 "highly confidential" images have not been shared with us yet? It was our 
understanding that you previously provided all "highly confidential" images to our client — and to defense counsel —
for review at the MDC in November. We are confused about where these previously undisclosed items were 
located and why they have not yet been made available for inspection and review. 
• During the week of April 19, Ms. Maxwell should be produced to 500 Pearl Street to review (with counsel and a 
defense staff member, on the 1 laptop provided) all of the 5,507 electronic images and video marked "highly 
confidential". These should be segregated into the three categories you describe (never-before produced, 
previously produced, and the 7 hard-copy images).

Please let us know if you will not agree to any of these steps so that we can address the issues with the Court. 
Thank you.

Subject: RE: US v. Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes 
All, 
Attached please find two spreadsheets documenting all physical evidence in the FBI's custody, as well as a corresponding 
discovery cover letter. We are sending a copy of these files to the MDC for your client as well. 
In response to your questions, the FBI has informed me of the following: 
Regarding the Highly Confidential nude/partially nudge images to be reviewed at 500 Pearl: 
• There are three categories of these images: 
o Approximately 2,100 electronic images and videos seized from Epstein's electronic devices (which have not 
been previously provided to you) 
o Approximately 3,400 electronic images from discs seized from Epstein's residences in 2019 (which have 
previously been provided to you and your client for review at the MDC) 
o Approximately 7 hard copy nude images located in the file from the FBI Florida office's investigation of 
Epstein (which have not been previously provided to you) 
• The FBI will make all three of those categories available to you. The electronic files will be provided on hard drives, 
and the FBI will provide you with the hard copy images for review as well. 
o All electronic images should be viewable as thumbnails, except those seized from Apple devices, which must 
be viewed using Cellebrite. 
o The Cellebrite software will be provided on the drive for your review of images and videos seized from Apple 
devices. 
o The electronic files have the same metadata on the hard drive that was available when the FBI seized each 
image. For images that were carved or deleted, no metadata was recovered, so none is viewable. For all 
other images, the metadata recovered should be viewable on the hard drive. 
o The approximately 2,100 electronic images and videos seized from Epstein's devices are separated by folder 
to indicate which device each image was seized from. 
• Because these images are considered obscene material, the FBI is not permitted to make duplicates of them, and 
there is a limited number of clean laptops on which these images can be reviewed. As a result, the FBI is only able 
to provide a single laptop for review of these images. 
Regarding the physical evidence: 
• Attached are two lists of all physical items in the FBI's custody relating to this case. The first list relates to items 
associated with the FBI Florida office's investigation of Epstein. The second list relates to items associated with the 
FBI New York office's current investigation. 
• The vast majority of physical evidence in the FBI's custody is located at the FBI's warehouse in the Bronx. Two 
items (18 77 & 1B 79) are located at 26 Federal Plaza, but the case agents can check those items out from 26 
EFTA00015779
--- PAGE 11 ---
Federal Plaza and bring them to the Bronx warehouse on whatever day you choose to conduct your review so that 
you will have all evidence in one place. 
• The FBI is able to arrange for the defense team to review all physical evidence at the Bronx warehouse under the 
following conditions: 
o The warehouse requires at least two weeks' notice in order to pull all of the items for the entire case and 
place them in a location where a large group of people can view them. 
o The warehouse is open during normal business hours between 9am and 5pm on weekdays. 
o At least two FBI agents and an AUSA will be present at the Bronx warehouse to assist and answer questions. 
o The evidence will be placed in a loading dock at the warehouse to provide additional space for the review. 
To ensure that there is sufficient space, please let me know how many members of the defense team intend 
to be physically present for this review. 
o Electronic devices such as cellphones and laptops are not permitted in the warehouse. The defense team 
may bring a digital camera that is not connected to the Internet or a cellular network into the warehouse. If 
the defense team wishes to photograph an item of evidence, the defense will need to inform the agents who 
are present, so that they may confirm that the photographed item is not Highly Confidential based on the 
presence of nudity. 
o Electronic media such as VHS tapes, cassette tapes, and CDs will not be playable at the warehouse. 
• To the extent the defense requests that the FBI bring any physical items to 500 Pearl Street for your client to review, 
the FBI is prepared to bring items that are reasonably sized to 500 Pearl Street. With respect to bulky or large 
items, the defense team should be able to photograph those for your client to review, unless they are deemed 
Highly Confidential, in which case the FBI can make arrangements to transport the item to 500 Pearl Street if 
necessary. 
• The FBI is in the process of confirming that it can provide devices to play all of the electronic media in the case in a 
single location at the FBI's offices in downtown Manhattan. We are also double-checking to confirm that all media 
that does not contain witness statements have already been produced to you and your client in discovery. The FBI 
anticipates that we can arrange for you to review all non-witness statement electronic media at the FBI's office in 
downtown Manhattan in approximately three weeks. 
o To the extent you wish to review all of the discs containing photographs, which were seized from Epstein's 
residences in 2019, we note that all of those images have already been produced to you in discovery. For 
your awareness, the FBI has informed me that it took their team several weeks to review all of the images on 
all of those discs. 
Please let me know how you wish to proceed.

Now that the FBI team is back, when do you expect to have answers to all of the questions posed? If I had an idea of 
when you would have answers, it could help me answer your question. 
At a minimum, it would not seem to take too much time to know when someone can open the FBI vault and allow the 
attorneys to make an initial view of the evidence. Also, I understand the FBI did not prepare an inventory of their 
evidence when they seized it from NY and LSJ, so I don't think we need to wait for them to now prepare an inventory 
before we start reviewing evidence. 
Also, when do you believe you will have a response regarding the discovery I requested last Monday? 
Thanks, 
Laura

Counsel, 
The FBI team on this case has been out of the office this week and will not be able to answer all of the questions you 
asked during our Wednesday call until they are back in the office next week. Please let me know if you would like to wait 
until all of those questions can be answered to schedule a day for your client to be brought to 500 Pearl Street to review 
the highly confidential images. My understanding is that the FBI is able to provide at least one laptop containing those 
highly confidential images in time for such a review to take place on Thursday 5/18, but I may not have the answers to all 
of your questions about those images before that date, and I do not know whether you will also be able to visit the 
evidence vault that same week. 
Please let me know how you would like to proceed. I will reach back out once I have answers to your questions. 
Thank you, 
Assistant United States Attorney

That is the only excel spreadsheet indexing physical evidence that we have produced in discovery. That spreadsheet does 
not include every physical item currently in the FBI's custody related to this case. For example, the August 20, 2020 
discovery production also included search warrant returns listing the physical items seized by the FBI's New York Office 
during the 2019 searches of Jeffrey Epstein's residences in New York and the U.S Virgin Islands (see Bates range 
SDNY_GM_00166007-SDNY_GM_00166043), but they are not contained in a spreadsheet. 
As a courtesy, I have asked the FBI whether it would be possible to provide us with a similar excel index reflecting the 
physical evidence seized by the FBI's New York Office, though it may take some time to compile such an index. 
Best,

Counsel, 
In advance of our call tomorrow, I wanted to send a copy of the attached index of physical items in FBI custody from the 
FBI-Miami office, which we previously produced to you as part of our August 21, 2020 discovery production. Also 
included in that August 21, 2020 production were scans of numerous items listed on the index. Those scans can be found 
within Bates range SDNY_GM_00172218-SDNY_GM_00173007. It may be useful to reference some of those items during 
our conversation tomorrow, so I wanted to make sure you were aware of them.

All, 
Today the Marshals and the FBI informed me that they are able to arrange for your client and the evidence to be at 500 
Pearl in time for the review to start as early as 8am each morning of the review period. The review can still continue until 
4:30pm each day. In order to take advantage of the extra time, I would propose planning to begin each review day at 
8:30am. You would also be welcome to arrive as early at 8am, and if the Marshals and FBI are ready to begin before 8:30, 
then we can do so. I will plan to be at 500 Pearl by 8am each morning. 
Also, the CSOs have asked for a list of everyone from the defense team who should be granted access into the proffer area 
on the fifth floor of 500 Pearl for the review. Would you please send me a list of the names of everyone who you expect 
to attend the review?

Laura, 
Below please find responses to the issues you raised: 
EFTA00015786
--- PAGE 2 ---
• We are confirmed for the review at the Bronx warehouse on April 12, 2021 from 11am to 4:30pm. 
• During the April 12th review, your team can see the evidence for yourselves and let me know if you need any of the 
items you are not permitted to photograph to be brought to 500 Pearl. Depending on the size of the item(s), we 
may need to figure out whether they can be brought later in the week once you have already reviewed several 
boxes, which would free up space in the FBI vehicle for the larger items. I'm confident we will be able to reach a 
reasonable agreement about those items. 
• For the bulky photos, you will not be permitted to photograph any that feature nudity. As referenced above, once 
your team has seen those photos for yourselves, you can let me know if you will need any to be brought to 500 
Pearl. 
• As I mentioned previously and is indicated in the spreadsheet, we are preparing a letter to defense counsel 
explaining why you will not be permitted to review those 16 discs. We expect to send you that letter tomorrow, 
after which I will be happy to discuss the matter further. 
• The blue-ray discs referenced in the spreadsheet are what the FBI burned in order to provide the USAO SDNY with 
a copy of electronic data to produce to you in discovery. The discs are not evidence themselves. The data is the 
evidence, and it was produced to you already. You are correct, however, that the 4/24/07 file is a data file that was 
copied from a VHS tape, which is currently located in the FBI's ELSUR office in Florida. We have asked that the 
original tape be shipped to New York, and it should arrive on Tuesday, April 13th. We will make it available for you 
to review once we have received it. We also plan to produce the digital file of that same recording to you as part of 
our productions of non-testifying witness statements. 
• The shredded paper is currently being analyzed by the FBI lab. We have asked the case agent to inquire with the 
lab regarding its anticipated timeline for analysis and will let you know when we expect it will be possible to have 
the shredded paper returned to New York for you to review. It will not, however, be available next week. 
• The "Missing from Assigned Box" items are items 1B130 and 1B110. Those items were migrated within the FBI 
evidence system from the Florida case to the New York case and incorporated into New York evidence item 
numbers 1B127, 1B128, & 1B137. So these items will be available for your review under those New York evidence 
numbers.

My apologies, I meant to include in my previous email that we could have the Bronx view on Monday April 12. Thank you 
for the logistics. 
Regarding the spreadsheets you provided, I have several issues. 
First, there are a couple of items that you have noted for the Bronx Warehouse but will in fact need to be brought to 500 
Pearl for review because you labeled them as "Highly Confidential" and not "bulky." These appear to include: 
NY Evidence List 
• Items 16127-130 (4 boxes). 
• Item 1B13 (1 box) 
Florida Evidence List 
. Item 1, Subitem 26 — one large framed photo from Master Bedroom. 
Second, with regard to the "Bulky" photos (Florida Items 1, Subitems 8, 15a, 15b and 15c), are we permitted to 
photograph those or not? If not, we will need them transported to 500 Pearl. 
Third, Florida Item 8, Subitem 8, says it is Sixteen DVD-R Discs from PBSO but you do not indicate that we can review 
those. Why? We need to address with the Court promptly any issues related to our request to view all evidence. 
Fourth, Electronic surveillance — Your email yesterday stated that these were all "electronic files" with no corresponding 
physical item. However, for several, the chart indicates "Blu-Ray Disks;" is there a reason we cannot inspect these? 
Another Florida item is listed as "one original recording of an interview dated 4/24/07"; I am suspicious that "one original 
recording of an interview" is not truly only an "electronic" file? I was practicing law in 2007 and do not recall "electronic 
files" being the standard then. Can you please confirm? I know that Chris has written separately about the many files for 
which the metadata has apparently been stripped, so we will have to address purely electronic information at another 
date. 
Shredded Paper — Yes, we need to review that as well. 
"Missing from Assigned Box" items — can you please provide more of an explanation for all "missing items"? 
I will let you know any other issues as I see them. However, now that we have made travel plans in reliance on your 
agreement to produce all evidence items, I am hoping that you can promptly answer these questions so that we can 
resolve any of them as needed this week. 
Thank you,

Hi Laura, 
The Bronx warehouse is located at 2350 Lafayette Ave, Bronx, NY. There is plenty of street parking outside of the 
building. Whatever day you wish to have the review conducted at the warehouse, an AUSA and an agent will meet the 
attorney, investigator, and paralegal at the warehouse to escort them into the building to the evidence review room. The 
AUSA will remain present at the warehouse to answer any questions that may arise. 
The FBI has informed me that they can make the evidence available for review at the warehouse any day next week or the 
week of April 19th• Please just let me know what day you prefer, and we will coordinate with the FBI to arrange for the 
review.

Good morning, 
Attached please find the revised spreadsheets, which reflect designations under the Protective Order for the three mini-
VHS tapes that I referenced below. 
I learned this morning that the Marshals intend to bring Ms. Maxwell back to the MDC each review day at 4:30pm. So we 
can plan for the review to take place at 500 Pearl Street from 9:30am to 4:30pm each day beginning on April 13th.

Good evening, 
Today, the Marshals confirmed that they will produce Ms. Maxwell to 500 Pearl Street on April 13, 2021 and every day 
thereafter until the evidence review is complete. My understanding is that Ms. Maxwell should arrive to 500 Pearl Street 
at approximately 9:30am each morning. So we are confirmed for evidence review in the proffer rooms on the 5th floor of 
the 500 Pearl Street courthouse beginning at 9:30am on April 13th. I will plan to be present and to continue assisting with 
logistics. If any questions or concerns arise, please feel free to call my cellphone at 
To assist in preparing for this review, attached please find annotated versions of the three evidence spreadsheets I 
previously emailed to you: (1) a spreadsheet of New York evidence; (2) a spreadsheet of Florida evidence; and (3) a more 
detailed spreadsheet of the sub-items contained in the Florida evidence spreadsheet. A couple things to note: 
• These spreadsheets now indicate the Protective Order designation, if any, for each item to be reviewed. As you will 
see, there are three mini-VHS tapes that I need to double check before assigning a final designation. I expect to be 
able to access a mini-VHS cassette player later this week, at which point I will be able to provide an updated 
spreadsheet with a confirmed designation for those three items. Additionally, please note that there is one item 
about which we plan to provide you with a letter later this week. 
• These spreadsheets also indicate where each item will be made available for the defense to review. As you will see, 
we have now learned that one item (consisting of shredded paper) is currently at FBI headquarters and will not be 
EFTA00015790
--- PAGE 6 ---
available for review next week. Please let me know if you believe you need to review that item, and I will inquire as 
to whether and how it can be relocated to New York. Additionally, all 1D items consist of electronic data (as 
opposed to 1B items, which are physical items). As is noted in the spreadsheets, the electronic data that constitute 
the 1D items in this case have either already been produced to you in discovery (e.g., pen register data, GPS data, 
and aerial footage), or are digital recordings of interviews that will be produced as non-testifying witness 
statements. Because these 1D items are data files stored in the FBI system, there is no corresponding physical item 
to produce for you to review. 
Please let me know when you would like to schedule a time for a smaller group from the defense team to review evidence 
at the Bronx warehouse.

Laura, 
Thank you for your email and for your understanding as we work through the logistics of arranging this review. Your 
modifications and clarifications are acceptable to us. Below I address each specifically: 
• The FBI can arrange for a lawyer, investigator, and paralegal to inspect and photograph the precluded items at the 
Bronx warehouse either next week or the week after. Please let us know what day you would like to arrange for 
that inspection, and I will coordinate with the FBI accordingly. I would suggest trying to schedule this visit early 
next week if possible so that if there are items that you believe need to be produced to 500 Pearl Street, we will 
have time to do so during a subsequent day of review at 500 Pearl if the FBI agrees to transport the item(s). 
• Tomorrow, I will send you evidence spreadsheets with annotations of which items the FBI will not be producing to 
500 Pearl Street, and which items we are designating under the Protective Order. Please note that certain items 
will be designated "Confidential," in which case they may be photographed, but the photographs should be treated 
as Confidential under the Protective Order. Other items will be designated "Highly Confidential," in which case they 
may not be photographed, absent specific authorization from an AUSA. I note the possibility of authorization to 
photograph this latter category because some Highly Confidential evidence items include both nude and non-nude 
portions, in which case we would permit photography of the non-nude portions. 
• In light of our decision to produce non-testifying witness statements beginning on April 12, 2021, we are no longer 
segregating any electronic media that contain witness statements during this review. This is because all of the 
witness statements on the electronic media in the FBI's possession are from witnesses whom the Government does 
not expect to call at trial in this case. Please note that we intend to produce digital audio files to you containing the 
EFTA00015791
--- PAGE 7 ---
contents of the electronic media with these non-testifying witness statements, but you are of course welcome to 
review the original recordings themselves. 
• In terms of space, I have been informed that we will not be permitted to conduct this review in a courtroom and 
will instead be required to do so in the proffer rooms. I have reserved the two largest proffer rooms available at 
500 Pearl. We can use the largest proffer room for evidence review, and the slightly smaller proffer room as a 
private meeting space for the defense team. 
• Confirmed, I will ask the FBI to bring all electronic highly confidential images to 500 Pearl Street, including the 
2,100 that were not previously reviewed and the electronic images that were previously provided for review at the 
MDC. 
• Confirmed, I will ask the FBI to bring the 7 hard-copy highly confidential materials to 500 Pearl Street. 
As I mentioned earlier today in a separate email, the FBI and AUSAs are prepared to facilitate this review beginning April 
13th and continuing every day thereafter until your review is complete. I have also formally requested that the Marshals 
produce Ms. Maxwell to 500 Pearl Street on April 13th and every day thereafter until the review is complete. The 
Marshals previously confirmed their willingness to produce Ms. Maxwell for such a review in general, but they have not 
yet confirmed their ability to do so on any particular dates. I will let you know as soon as the Marshals inform me 
whether they can accommodate these specific dates.

Subject: RE: US v. Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes 
Thank you for your email. Your proposal is largely acceptable to us, with the following modifications and clarifications. 
• For the items that you propose below to exclude from the evidence transported to 500 Pearl Street (with the 
exception of the cash held at 26 Federal Plaza), we will need to have access for a lawyer, investigator and paralegal 
to inspect and photograph those items at the Bronx warehouse. This seems to include the bulky items, electronic 
devices and "fragile" items. 
o Once they are photographed and shared with the team and our client, we can decide whether a separate 
inspection by our client and/or any expert is necessary at a later time. To be clear, the government's photos 
of these same items are insufficient. 
o If there are any items we are not permitted to photograph (and perhaps you will be able to tell us by April 5 
which those are), we likely will need to have those transported because there is no way for our client to 
inspect the evidence. We can wait to finalize this issue until you have finished deciding what items you 
consider non-photographable, and if we can't agree, then discuss next steps. 
EFTA00015792
--- PAGE 8 ---
o Please let us know when these "non-transportable" items can be inspected and photographed at the Bronx 
warehouse. It makes sense that it would be done soon so that we can raise any issues as necessary with the 
Court. 
• For playing any of the electronic media, we will obtain the necessary equipment to play at 500 Pearl Street and 
seek permission to bring those devices into the Courthouse. You can segregate out the section of recordings that 
contain "witness statements" and advise us then which ones cannot be played, but we still need to inspect the 
outside of those recordings. 
• As far as space, can you please advise whether the largest proffer room will be available for review of evidence? It 
is my understanding that it can accommodate a large number of the team members at one time. If not, is a locked 
courtroom available for us to review the evidence? The agents could bring out a limited number of boxes at a time 
for inspection. 
• We understand that the evidence will not be taken outside of the monitoring of the agents or your staff and 
appreciate that you will have a separate room for us to consult with our client privately (without the evidence). 
• We understand that all of the highly confidential materials, including not only the 2,100 images not previously 
disclosed as well as the electronic images that were only shown to NY counsel and the client at the MDC, will be 
available for review on a singular laptop at 500 Pearl Street. 
• We also understand the 7 hard-copy highly confidential materials will also be available for inspection at 500 Pearl 
Street. 
Please let me know if you have any questions or disagree with my understanding. If you agree, we can then proceed as 
scheduled on April 12 and continue day to day until we are finished, with a break if necessary for the arraignment.

Subject: RE: US v. Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes 
Counsel, 
Thank you for your email. Below please find our response. If this is acceptable to you, then we will proceed with 
arranging the logistics of having your client produced to 500 Pearl the week of April 12th and the week April 19th. We will 
also arrange for the FBI to transport evidence to 500 Pearl for review the week of April 12th. 
Physical Evidence 
• It is not reasonable or feasible to insist that the FBI bring all physical evidence to 500 Pearl Street. That said, we are 
certainly willing to work with you to ensure that your client can review any physical items that are material to the 
preparation of her defense. 
• We would propose excluding the below items from production to 500 Pearl: 
o We appreciate your note that the massage tables are not needed, which will certainly help with the logistics 
of transport. 
o We also appreciate your indication that the cash items from 26 Federal Plaza do not need to be produced. 
Those are the only items not located in the Bronx warehouse. 
EFTA00015793
--- PAGE 9 ---
o The FBI has seized dozens of electronic devices, including desktop computers, servers, and laptops, from 
Jeffrey Epstein's residences in 2019. Photographs of those devices were produced in our August 2020 
productions as part of the search warrant photographs, and you have received copies of the data that was 
seized from those devices pursuant to a warrant. The production of these devices would be very 
cumbersome, and we do not see any value in looking at an electronic device that cannot be turned on. 
o The framed pictures are bulky and cumbersome to transport. These are also very delicate and are difficult 
to transport. Photographs of those seized images were already provided to you as part of the photographs 
from the searches of Epstein's residences. 
o Certain items seized from the New York residence are bulky, fragile, and/or difficult to transport. These 
include plaster busts of female torsos and a stuffed dog. Photographs of these items were already provided 
to you from the search of the New York residence. 
• The remaining physical items of evidence would fit into approximately 15 to 20 boxes. The FBI has indicated that it 
would be feasible to transport those boxes to 500 Pearl Street. 
• Regarding your request for equipment that can play the recordings, we believe they would require a VCR, a cassette 
player, a CD player, an adapter for a micro VHS tape, and a microcassette player. If you wish to play these 
recordings at 500 Pearl, you will need to provide that equipment. We have asked the FBI whether any other 
equipment would be necessary and will let you know if that is the case prior to the date of your review. It is our 
understanding that any recordings that are not witness statements and that are not highly confidential have been 
produced to you in discovery. We are not aware of any discoverable, non-highly confidential, recordings that were 
not produced to you as part of the Government's discovery productions in the fall. To confirm that understanding, 
we are working with the FBI to physically doublecheck each recording. If we identify any discoverable recordings 
that have not already been produced, we will promptly provide them to you. 
• The segregation of highly confidential material will require the FBI and an AUSA to physically review each item to 
confirm the item's status. We will endeavor to do so by your requested date of April 5, 2021. 
• We can confirm that neither the AUSA(s) nor the agent(s) will record or attempt to record any part of the evidence 
review or conversations among the defense team or with the defendant during this review. Although the evidence 
cannot be left outside of the presence of an agent, we will ensure that a room is available for the defense team and 
the defendant to confer privately away from the agent(s) and the AUSA(s) without monitoring. 
• As for your request for a space large enough to fit 8 members of the defense team, the defendant, an agent, an 
AUSA, and the evidence, my office cannot control the space that the Marshals allow us to use at 500 Pearl outside 
of the proffer rooms. We will certainly request as large a space as possible, but if we are required to use the 
proffer rooms, then members of the defense team may need to rotate in and out of the room. I know members of 
the defense team have been in those proffer rooms before, and they can hopefully provide some thoughts on how 
we might use the proffer room space effectively for your purposes. If the Court grants authorization for the 
defense to bring electronic devices into 500 Pearl, that is certainly fine with the Government, and you may note our 
consent in your request to Judge Nathan for such authorization. 
Highly Confidential Electronic Images 
• The 2,100 electronic images were recovered during the responsiveness review of images and videos seized from 
Jeffrey Epstein's devices, which review was not complete until early November 2020. We indicated on page 4 the 
cover letter to our November 9, 2020 production, which included all other images and videos from those devices, 
that "the Federal Bureau of Investigation ('FBI') seized multiple nude and partially nude images from several for the 
above-listed electronic devices. All such images have been designated Highly Confidential. The FBI will make these 
images available for review by the defense upon request." We did not receive a request from the defense to review 
these images until your March 8, 2021 letter, which requested to "view and inspect all materials designated by your 
office as 'Highly Confidential' under the terms of the Protective Order". 
• We did not ask the FBI to bring the 7 hard copy images to the MDC in the fall because we did not understand you to 
be requesting a review of physical, non-electronic evidence during those meetings. Our understanding of the 
defense request at that time was to review the electronic highly confidential images that were recovered from CDs 
from Epstein's residence. We will ensure that the 7 hard copy images are available to you for review at 500 Pearl.

Subject: RE: US v. Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes 
All, 
We have considered your proposal. Unfortunately, it does not permit us an adequate ability to review the evidence in the 
case and does not permit our client to meaningfully participate in her own defense. 
First, we are unable to meaningfully review the evidence without the benefit of our laptops and other electronic devices 
which are needed to take notes of our review. We also need access to our devices during the review to compare the 
physical evidence with the electronic discovery and with our work product. 
Second, we need to provide our client the ability to review all discovery, including any recordings, in order to assist in her 
own defense. Presuming that she will not be taken to the FBI downtown office, then your proposal offers no means by 
which she can both inspect a recording in its physical form and listen to the recording at the same time. 
In order to address the deficiencies in your proposal, we believe the following are necessary: 
Physical Evidence 
• All of the physical evidence currently located in the FBI Bronx warehouse will be transported to 500 Pearl Street 
and made available during the week of April 12, with our client present, in a room sufficiently large to 
accommodate 8 attorneys and investigators. 
o We do not need the "bulky" massage tables transported; if there are any other extremely large evidence 
pieces, let us know what they are and we can consider whether we can have someone review and 
photograph those at the Bronx warehouse at an earlier time. 
o From your email, it appears that only two items are not located at the Bronx warehouse — both envelopes 
with cash. Please confirm this. We do not need the two "cash" evidence items transported to 500 Pearl. 
o If there are other evidence items housed somewhere other than the Bronx, please let us know what they are 
and where they are. 
• We will be permitted to bring our laptops, and a camera, into 500 Pearl Street; we are happy to seek permission 
from Judge Nathan to do so. 
• Either the FBI can provide the equipment necessary to listen to any of the recordings at 500 Pearl Street or we can 
bring the necessary equipment. If we are to provide the equipment, we will need to know in advance the formats 
of each recording so that we can be prepared. You can note that on your Excel spreadsheet by the item number by 
March 29 to give us adequate time to secure the necessary equipment. 
EFTA00015795
--- PAGE 11 ---
• The FBI can segregate any physical evidence that you deem "highly confidential." You can identify any "highly 
confidential" physical evidence items on your Excel spreadsheets by April 5 (one week before the evidence view). If 
we need to photograph or reproduce any such item for expert evaluation, we will seek leave of court. Otherwise, 
we will not photograph any such items during the review during the week of April 12. This will ensure the evidence 
review proceeds smoothly and there will not be any need to ask permission to photograph on an item by item 
basis. 
• The FBI also can segregate any recordings which we will be able to inspect, but not listen to, during the evidence 
view the week of April 12. You can note such designation on your Excel spreadsheet. If we disagree, we can seek 
leave of the Court in advance. 
• We understand that an FBI Agent and/or AUSA may be present during our physical evidence review at 500 Pearl 
Street but of course must ensure that no recordings are made of our conversations and also ensure that there is a 
separate, secure room in which we can confer with our client during the evidence view without monitoring by the 
government. 
• Please confirm whether all electronic recordings (other than the highly-confidential images and videos described 
below) have previously been produced to us, and if not, please explain which ones were not produced by the 
discovery deadlines last fall and why. 
Highly Confidential Electronic Evidence 
• Can you please explain why 2,100 + 7 "highly confidential" images have not been shared with us yet? It was our 
understanding that you previously provided all "highly confidential" images to our client — and to defense counsel —
for review at the MDC in November. We are confused about where these previously undisclosed items were 
located and why they have not yet been made available for inspection and review. 
• During the week of April 19, Ms. Maxwell should be produced to 500 Pearl Street to review (with counsel and a 
defense staff member, on the 1 laptop provided) all of the 5,507 electronic images and video marked "highly 
confidential". These should be segregated into the three categories you describe (never-before produced, 
previously produced, and the 7 hard-copy images). 
Please let us know if you will not agree to any of these steps so that we can address the issues with the Court. 
Thank you.

Subject: RE: US v. Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes 
< 
All, 
Attached please find two spreadsheets documenting all physical evidence in the FBI's custody, as well as a corresponding 
discovery cover letter. We are sending a copy of these files to the MDC for your client as well. 
In response to your questions, the FBI has informed me of the following: 
Regarding the Highly Confidential nude/partially nudge images to be reviewed at 500 Pearl: 
• There are three categories of these images: 
EFTA00015796
--- PAGE 12 ---
o Approximately 2,100 electronic images and videos seized from Epstein's electronic devices (which have not 
been previously provided to you) 
o Approximately 3,400 electronic images from discs seized from Epstein's residences in 2019 (which have 
previously been provided to you and your client for review at the MDC) 
o Approximately 7 hard copy nude images located in the file from the FBI Florida office's investigation of 
Epstein (which have not been previously provided to you) 
• The FBI will make all three of those categories available to you. The electronic files will be provided on hard drives, 
and the FBI will provide you with the hard copy images for review as well. 
o All electronic images should be viewable as thumbnails, except those seized from Apple devices, which must 
be viewed using Cellebrite. 
o The Cellebrite software will be provided on the drive for your review of images and videos seized from Apple 
devices. 
o The electronic files have the same metadata on the hard drive that was available when the FBI seized each 
image. For images that were carved or deleted, no metadata was recovered, so none is viewable. For all 
other images, the metadata recovered should be viewable on the hard drive. 
o The approximately 2,100 electronic images and videos seized from Epstein's devices are separated by folder 
to indicate which device each image was seized from. 
• Because these images are considered obscene material, the FBI is not permitted to make duplicates of them, and 
there is a limited number of clean laptops on which these images can be reviewed. As a result, the FBI is only able 
to provide a single laptop for review of these images. 
Regarding the physical evidence: 
• Attached are two lists of all physical items in the FBI's custody relating to this case. The first list relates to items 
associated with the FBI Florida office's investigation of Epstein. The second list relates to items associated with the 
FBI New York office's current investigation. 
• The vast majority of physical evidence in the FBI's custody is located at the FBI's warehouse in the Bronx. Two 
items (18 77 & 1B 79) are located at 26 Federal Plaza, but the case agents can check those items out from 26 
Federal Plaza and bring them to the Bronx warehouse on whatever day you choose to conduct your review so that 
you will have all evidence in one place. 
• The FBI is able to arrange for the defense team to review all physical evidence at the Bronx warehouse under the 
following conditions: 
o The warehouse requires at least two weeks' notice in order to pull all of the items for the entire case and 
place them in a location where a large group of people can view them. 
o The warehouse is open during normal business hours between 9am and 5pm on weekdays. 
o At least two FBI agents and an AUSA will be present at the Bronx warehouse to assist and answer questions. 
o The evidence will be placed in a loading dock at the warehouse to provide additional space for the review. 
To ensure that there is sufficient space, please let me know how many members of the defense team intend 
to be physically present for this review. 
o Electronic devices such as cellphones and laptops are not permitted in the warehouse. The defense team 
may bring a digital camera that is not connected to the Internet or a cellular network into the warehouse. If 
the defense team wishes to photograph an item of evidence, the defense will need to inform the agents who 
are present, so that they may confirm that the photographed item is not Highly Confidential based on the 
presence of nudity. 
o Electronic media such as VHS tapes, cassette tapes, and CDs will not be playable at the warehouse. 
• To the extent the defense requests that the FBI bring any physical items to 500 Pearl Street for your client to review, 
the FBI is prepared to bring items that are reasonably sized to 500 Pearl Street. With respect to bulky or large 
items, the defense team should be able to photograph those for your client to review, unless they are deemed 
Highly Confidential, in which case the FBI can make arrangements to transport the item to 500 Pearl Street if 
necessary. 
• The FBI is in the process of confirming that it can provide devices to play all of the electronic media in the case in a 
single location at the FBI's offices in downtown Manhattan. We are also double-checking to confirm that all media 
that does not contain witness statements have already been produced to you and your client in discovery. The FBI 
anticipates that we can arrange for you to review all non-witness statement electronic media at the FBI's office in 
downtown Manhattan in approximately three weeks. 
EFTA00015797
--- PAGE 13 ---
o To the extent you wish to review all of the discs containing photographs, which were seized from Epstein's 
residences in 2019, we note that all of those images have already been produced to you in discovery. For 
your awareness, the FBI has informed me that it took their team several weeks to review all of the images on 
all of those discs. 
Please let me know how you wish to proceed.

Now that the FBI team is back, when do you expect to have answers to all of the questions posed? If I had an idea of 
when you would have answers, it could help me answer your question. 
At a minimum, it would not seem to take too much time to know when someone can open the FBI vault and allow the 
attorneys to make an initial view of the evidence. Also, I understand the FBI did not prepare an inventory of their 
evidence when they seized it from NY and LSJ, so I don't think we need to wait for them to now prepare an inventory 
before we start reviewing evidence. 
Also, when do you believe you will have a response regarding the discovery I requested last Monday? 
Thanks, 
Laura

Counsel, 
The FBI team on this case has been out of the office this week and will not be able to answer all of the questions you 
asked during our Wednesday call until they are back in the office next week. Please let me know if you would like to wait 
until all of those questions can be answered to schedule a day for your client to be brought to 500 Pearl Street to review 
the highly confidential images. My understanding is that the FBI is able to provide at least one laptop containing those 
highly confidential images in time for such a review to take place on Thursday 5/18, but I may not have the answers to all 
of your questions about those images before that date, and I do not know whether you will also be able to visit the 
evidence vault that same week. 
Please let me know how you would like to proceed. I will reach back out once I have answers to your questions.

That is the only excel spreadsheet indexing physical evidence that we have produced in discovery. That spreadsheet does 
not include every physical item currently in the FBI's custody related to this case. For example, the August 20, 2020 
discovery production also included search warrant returns listing the physical items seized by the FBI's New York Office 
during the 2019 searches of Jeffrey Epstein's residences in New York and the U.S Virgin Islands (see Bates range 
SDNY_GM_00166007-SDNY_GM_00166043), but they are not contained in a spreadsheet. 
As a courtesy, I have asked the FBI whether it would be possible to provide us with a similar excel index reflecting the 
physical evidence seized by the FBI's New York Office, though it may take some time to compile such an index.

Counsel, 
In advance of our call tomorrow, I wanted to send a copy of the attached index of physical items in FBI custody from the 
FBI-Miami office, which we previously produced to you as part of our August 21, 2020 discovery production. Also 
included in that August 21, 2020 production were scans of numerous items listed on the index. Those scans can be found 
within Bates range SDNY_GM_00172218-SDNY_GM_00173007. It may be useful to reference some of those items during 
our conversation tomorrow, so I wanted to make sure you were aware of them.

Laura, 
Below please find responses to the issues you raised: 
EFTA00015805
--- PAGE 3 ---
• We are confirmed for the review at the Bronx warehouse on April 12, 2021 from 11am to 4:30pm. 
• During the April 12th review, your team can see the evidence for yourselves and let me know if you need any of 
the items you are not permitted to photograph to be brought to 500 Pearl. Depending on the size of the item(s), 
we may need to figure out whether they can be brought later in the week once you have already reviewed 
several boxes, which would free up space in the FBI vehicle for the larger items. I'm confident we will be able to 
reach a reasonable agreement about those items. 
• For the bulky photos, you will not be permitted to photograph any that feature nudity. As referenced above, once 
your team has seen those photos for yourselves, you can let me know if you will need any to be brought to 500 
Pearl. 
• As I mentioned previously and is indicated in the spreadsheet, we are preparing a letter to defense counsel 
explaining why you will not be permitted to review those 16 discs. We expect to send you that letter tomorrow, 
after which I will be happy to discuss the matter further. 
• The blue-ray discs referenced in the spreadsheet are what the FBI burned in order to provide the USAO SDNY 
with a copy of electronic data to produce to you in discovery. The discs are not evidence themselves. The data is 
the evidence, and it was produced to you already. You are correct, however, that the 4/24/07 file is a data file 
that was copied from a VHS tape, which is currently located in the FBI's ELSUR office in Florida. We have asked 
that the original tape be shipped to New York, and it should arrive on Tuesday, April 13th. We will make it 
available for you to review once we have received it. We also plan to produce the digital file of that same 
recording to you as part of our productions of non-testifying witness statements. 
• The shredded paper is currently being analyzed by the FBI lab. We have asked the case agent to inquire with the 
lab regarding its anticipated timeline for analysis and will let you know when we expect it will be possible to have 
the shredded paper returned to New York for you to review. It will not, however, be available next week. 
• The "Missing from Assigned Box" items are items 1B130 and 1B110. Those items were migrated within the FBI 
evidence system from the Florida case to the New York case and incorporated into New York evidence item 
numbers 1B127, 1B128, & 1B137. So these items will be available for your review under those New York 
evidence numbers.

Subject: RE: US v. Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes 
My apologies, I meant to include in my previous email that we could have the Bronx view on Monday April 12. Thank 
you for the logistics. 
Regarding the spreadsheets you provided, I have several issues. 
First, there are a couple of items that you have noted for the Bronx Warehouse but will in fact need to be brought to 500 
Pearl for review because you labeled them as "Highly Confidential" and not "bulky." These appear to include: 
NY Evidence List 
• Items 16127-130 (4 boxes). 
• Item 1B13 (1 box) 
Florida Evidence List 
. Item 1, Subitem 26 — one large framed photo from Master Bedroom. 
Second, with regard to the "Bulky" photos (Florida Items 1, Subitems 8, 15a, 15b and 15c), are we permitted to 
photograph those or not? If not, we will need them transported to 500 Pearl. 
Third, Florida Item 8, Subitem 8, says it is Sixteen DVD-R Discs from PBSO but you do not indicate that we can review 
those. Why? We need to address with the Court promptly any issues related to our request to view all evidence. 
Fourth, Electronic surveillance — Your email yesterday stated that these were all "electronic files" with no corresponding 
physical item. However, for several, the chart indicates "Blu-Ray Disks;" is there a reason we cannot inspect these? 
Another Florida item is listed as "one original recording of an interview dated 4/24/07"; I am suspicious that "one 
original recording of an interview" is not truly only an "electronic" file? I was practicing law in 2007 and do not recall 
"electronic files" being the standard then. Can you please confirm? I know that Chris has written separately about the 
many files for which the metadata has apparently been stripped, so we will have to address purely electronic 
information at another date. 
Shredded Paper — Yes, we need to review that as well. 
"Missing from Assigned Box" items — can you please provide more of an explanation for all "missing items"? 
I will let you know any other issues as I see them. However, now that we have made travel plans in reliance on your 
agreement to produce all evidence items, I am hoping that you can promptly answer these questions so that we can 
resolve any of them as needed this week. 
Thank you,

Hi Laura, 
The Bronx warehouse is located at 2350 Lafayette Ave, Bronx, NY. There is plenty of street parking outside of the 
building. Whatever day you wish to have the review conducted at the warehouse, an AUSA and an agent will meet the 
attorney, investigator, and paralegal at the warehouse to escort them into the building to the evidence review room. 
The AUSA will remain present at the warehouse to answer any questions that may arise. 
The FBI has informed me that they can make the evidence available for review at the warehouse any day next week or 
the week of April 19th. Please just let me know what day you prefer, and we will coordinate with the FBI to arrange for 
the review.

Good morning, 
Attached please find the revised spreadsheets, which reflect designations under the Protective Order for the three mini-
VHS tapes that I referenced below. 
I learned this morning that the Marshals intend to bring Ms. Maxwell back to the MDC each review day at 4:30pm. So 
we can plan for the review to take place at 500 Pearl Street from 9:30am to 4:30pm each day beginning on April 13th.

Good evening, 
Today, the Marshals confirmed that they will produce Ms. Maxwell to 500 Pearl Street on April 13, 2021 and every day 
thereafter until the evidence review is complete. My understanding is that Ms. Maxwell should arrive to 500 Pearl 
Street at approximately 9:30am each morning. So we are confirmed for evidence review in the proffer rooms on the 5th
floor of the 500 Pearl Street courthouse beginning at 9:30am on April 13th. I will plan to be present and to continue 
assisting with logistics. If any questions or concerns arise, please feel free to call my cellphone at 
To assist in preparing for this review, attached please find annotated versions of the three evidence spreadsheets I 
previously emailed to you: (1) a spreadsheet of New York evidence; (2) a spreadsheet of Florida evidence; and (3) a 
more detailed spreadsheet of the sub-items contained in the Florida evidence spreadsheet. A couple things to note: 
• These spreadsheets now indicate the Protective Order designation, if any, for each item to be reviewed. As you 
will see, there are three mini-VHS tapes that I need to double check before assigning a final designation. I expect 
to be able to access a mini-VHS cassette player later this week, at which point I will be able to provide an updated 
spreadsheet with a confirmed designation for those three items. Additionally, please note that there is one item 
about which we plan to provide you with a letter later this week. 
• These spreadsheets also indicate where each item will be made available for the defense to review. As you will 
see, we have now learned that one item (consisting of shredded paper) is currently at FBI headquarters and will 
EFTA00015809
--- PAGE 7 ---
not be available for review next week. Please let me know if you believe you need to review that item, and I will 
inquire as to whether and how it can be relocated to New York. Additionally, all 1D items consist of electronic 
data (as opposed to 1B items, which are physical items). As is noted in the spreadsheets, the electronic data that 
constitute the 1D items in this case have either already been produced to you in discovery (e.g., pen register data, 
GP5 data, and aerial footage), or are digital recordings of interviews that will be produced as non-testifying 
witness statements. Because these 1D items are data files stored in the FBI system, there is no corresponding 
physical item to produce for you to review. 
Please let me know when you would like to schedule a time for a smaller group from the defense team to review 
evidence at the Bronx warehouse.

Laura, 
Thank you for your email and for your understanding as we work through the logistics of arranging this review. Your 
modifications and clarifications are acceptable to us. Below I address each specifically: 
• The FBI can arrange for a lawyer, investigator, and paralegal to inspect and photograph the precluded items at the 
Bronx warehouse either next week or the week after. Please let us know what day you would like to arrange for 
that inspection, and I will coordinate with the FBI accordingly. I would suggest trying to schedule this visit early 
next week if possible so that if there are items that you believe need to be produced to 500 Pearl Street, we will 
have time to do so during a subsequent day of review at 500 Pearl if the FBI agrees to transport the item(s). 
• Tomorrow, I will send you evidence spreadsheets with annotations of which items the FBI will not be producing to 
500 Pearl Street, and which items we are designating under the Protective Order. Please note that certain items 
will be designated "Confidential," in which case they may be photographed, but the photographs should be 
treated as Confidential under the Protective Order. Other items will be designated "Highly Confidential," in which 
case they may not be photographed, absent specific authorization from an AM. I note the possibility of 
authorization to photograph this latter category because some Highly Confidential evidence items include both 
nude and non-nude portions, in which case we would permit photography of the non-nude portions. 
• In light of our decision to produce non-testifying witness statements beginning on April 12, 2021, we are no 
longer segregating any electronic media that contain witness statements during this review. This is because all of 
the witness statements on the electronic media in the FBI's possession are from witnesses whom the 
Government does not expect to call at trial in this case. Please note that we intend to produce digital audio files 
EFTA00015810
--- PAGE 8 ---
to you containing the contents of the electronic media with these non-testifying witness statements, but you are 
of course welcome to review the original recordings themselves. 
• In terms of space, I have been informed that we will not be permitted to conduct this review in a courtroom and 
will instead be required to do so in the proffer rooms. I have reserved the two largest proffer rooms available at 
500 Pearl. We can use the largest proffer room for evidence review, and the slightly smaller proffer room as a 
private meeting space for the defense team. 
• Confirmed, I will ask the FBI to bring all electronic highly confidential images to 500 Pearl Street, including the 
2,100 that were not previously reviewed and the electronic images that were previously provided for review at 
the MDC. 
• Confirmed, I will ask the FBI to bring the 7 hard-copy highly confidential materials to 500 Pearl Street. 
As I mentioned earlier today in a separate email, the FBI and AUSAs are prepared to facilitate this review beginning April 
13th and continuing every day thereafter until your review is complete. I have also formally requested that the Marshals 
produce Ms. Maxwell to 500 Pearl Street on April 13th and every day thereafter until the review is complete. The 
Marshals previously confirmed their willingness to produce Ms. Maxwell for such a review in general, but they have not 
yet confirmed their ability to do so on any particular dates. I will let you know as soon as the Marshals inform me 
whether they can accommodate these specific dates.

Subject: RE: US v. Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes 
Thank you for your email. Your proposal is largely acceptable to us, with the following modifications and clarifications. 
• For the items that you propose below to exclude from the evidence transported to 500 Pearl Street (with the 
exception of the cash held at 26 Federal Plaza), we will need to have access for a lawyer, investigator and 
paralegal to inspect and photograph those items at the Bronx warehouse. This seems to include the bulky items, 
electronic devices and "fragile" items. 
o Once they are photographed and shared with the team and our client, we can decide whether a separate 
inspection by our client and/or any expert is necessary at a later time. To be clear, the government's 
photos of these same items are insufficient. 
o If there are any items we are not permitted to photograph (and perhaps you will be able to tell us by April 
which those are), we likely will need to have those transported because there is no way for our client to 
inspect the evidence. We can wait to finalize this issue until you have finished deciding what items you 
consider non-photographable, and if we can't agree, then discuss next steps. 
EFTA00015811
--- PAGE 9 ---
o Please let us know when these "non-transportable" items can be inspected and photographed at the Bronx 
warehouse. It makes sense that it would be done soon so that we can raise any issues as necessary with 
the Court. 
• For playing any of the electronic media, we will obtain the necessary equipment to play at 500 Pearl Street and 
seek permission to bring those devices into the Courthouse. You can segregate out the section of recordings that 
contain "witness statements" and advise us then which ones cannot be played, but we still need to inspect the 
outside of those recordings. 
• As far as space, can you please advise whether the largest proffer room will be available for review of evidence? 
It is my understanding that it can accommodate a large number of the team members at one time. If not, is a 
locked courtroom available for us to review the evidence? The agents could bring out a limited number of boxes 
at a time for inspection. 
• We understand that the evidence will not be taken outside of the monitoring of the agents or your staff and 
appreciate that you will have a separate room for us to consult with our client privately (without the evidence). 
• We understand that all of the highly confidential materials, including not only the 2,100 images not previously 
disclosed as well as the electronic images that were only shown to NY counsel and the client at the MDC, will be 
available for review on a singular laptop at 500 Pearl Street. 
• We also understand the 7 hard-copy highly confidential materials will also be available for inspection at 500 Pearl 
Street. 
Please let me know if you have any questions or disagree with my understanding. If you agree, we can then proceed as 
scheduled on April 12 and continue day to day until we are finished, with a break if necessary for the arraignment.

Counsel, 
Thank you for your email. Below please find our response. If this is acceptable to you, then we will proceed with 
arranging the logistics of having your client produced to 500 Pearl the week of April 12th and the week April 19th. We 
will also arrange for the FBI to transport evidence to 500 Pearl for review the week of April 12th. 
Physical Evidence 
• It is not reasonable or feasible to insist that the FBI bring all physical evidence to 500 Pearl Street. That said, we 
are certainly willing to work with you to ensure that your client can review any physical items that are material to 
the preparation of her defense. 
• We would propose excluding the below items from production to 500 Pearl: 
o We appreciate your note that the massage tables are not needed, which will certainly help with the 
logistics of transport. 
o We also appreciate your indication that the cash items from 26 Federal Plaza do not need to be produced. 
Those are the only items not located in the Bronx warehouse. 
EFTA00015812

o The FBI has seized dozens of electronic devices, including desktop computers, servers, and laptops, from 
Jeffrey Epstein's residences in 2019. Photographs of those devices were produced in our August 2020 
productions as part of the search warrant photographs, and you have received copies of the data that was 
seized from those devices pursuant to a warrant. The production of these devices would be very 
cumbersome, and we do not see any value in looking at an electronic device that cannot be turned on. 
o The framed pictures are bulky and cumbersome to transport. These are also very delicate and are difficult 
to transport. Photographs of those seized images were already provided to you as part of the photographs 
from the searches of Epstein's residences. 
o Certain items seized from the New York residence are bulky, fragile, and/or difficult to transport. These 
include plaster busts of female torsos and a stuffed dog. Photographs of these items were already 
provided to you from the search of the New York residence. 
• The remaining physical items of evidence would fit into approximately 15 to 20 boxes. The FBI has indicated that 
it would be feasible to transport those boxes to 500 Pearl Street. 
• Regarding your request for equipment that can play the recordings, we believe they would require a VCR, a 
cassette player, a CD player, an adapter for a micro VHS tape, and a microcassette player. If you wish to play these 
recordings at 500 Pearl, you will need to provide that equipment. We have asked the FBI whether any other 
equipment would be necessary and will let you know if that is the case prior to the date of your review. It is our 
understanding that any recordings that are not witness statements and that are not highly confidential have been 
produced to you in discovery. We are not aware of any discoverable, non-highly confidential, recordings that 
were not produced to you as part of the Government's discovery productions in the fall. To confirm that 
understanding, we are working with the FBI to physically doublecheck each recording. If we identify any 
discoverable recordings that have not already been produced, we will promptly provide them to you. 
• The segregation of highly confidential material will require the FBI and an AUSA to physically review each item to 
confirm the item's status. We will endeavor to do so by your requested date of April 5, 2021. 
• We can confirm that neither the AUSA(s) nor the agent(s) will record or attempt to record any part of the 
evidence review or conversations among the defense team or with the defendant during this review. Although 
the evidence cannot be left outside of the presence of an agent, we will ensure that a room is available for the 
defense team and the defendant to confer privately away from the agent(s) and the AUSA(s) without monitoring. 
• As for your request for a space large enough to fit 8 members of the defense team, the defendant, an agent, an 
AUSA, and the evidence, my office cannot control the space that the Marshals allow us to use at 500 Pearl 
outside of the proffer rooms. We will certainly request as large a space as possible, but if we are required to use 
the proffer rooms, then members of the defense team may need to rotate in and out of the room. I know 
members of the defense team have been in those proffer rooms before, and they can hopefully provide some 
thoughts on how we might use the proffer room space effectively for your purposes. If the Court grants 
authorization for the defense to bring electronic devices into 500 Pearl, that is certainly fine with the 
Government, and you may note our consent in your request to Judge Nathan for such authorization. 
Highly Confidential Electronic Images 
• The 2,100 electronic images were recovered during the responsiveness review of images and videos seized from 
Jeffrey Epstein's devices, which review was not complete until early November 2020. We indicated on page 4 the 
cover letter to our November 9, 2020 production, which included all other images and videos from those devices, 
that "the Federal Bureau of Investigation ('FBI') seized multiple nude and partially nude images from several for 
the above-listed electronic devices. All such images have been designated Highly Confidential. The FBI will make 
these images available for review by the defense upon request." We did not receive a request from the defense 
to review these images until your March 8, 2021 letter, which requested to "view and inspect all materials 
designated by your office as 'Highly Confidential' under the terms of the Protective Order". 
• We did not ask the FBI to bring the 7 hard copy images to the MDC in the fall because we did not understand you 
to be requesting a review of physical, non-electronic evidence during those meetings. Our understanding of the 
defense request at that time was to review the electronic highly confidential images that were recovered from 
EFTA00015813
--- PAGE 11 ---
CDs from Epstein's residence. We will ensure that the 7 hard copy images are available to you for review at 500 
Pearl.

Subject: RE: US v. Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes 
All, 
We have considered your proposal. Unfortunately, it does not permit us an adequate ability to review the evidence in 
the case and does not permit our client to meaningfully participate in her own defense. 
First, we are unable to meaningfully review the evidence without the benefit of our laptops and other electronic devices 
which are needed to take notes of our review. We also need access to our devices during the review to compare the 
physical evidence with the electronic discovery and with our work product. 
Second, we need to provide our client the ability to review all discovery, including any recordings, in order to assist in 
her own defense. Presuming that she will not be taken to the FBI downtown office, then your proposal offers no means 
by which she can both inspect a recording in its physical form and listen to the recording at the same time. 
In order to address the deficiencies in your proposal, we believe the following are necessary: 
Physical Evidence 
• All of the physical evidence currently located in the FBI Bronx warehouse will be transported to 500 Pearl Street 
and made available during the week of April 12, with our client present, in a room sufficiently large to 
accommodate 8 attorneys and investigators. 
o We do not need the "bulky" massage tables transported; if there are any other extremely large evidence 
pieces, let us know what they are and we can consider whether we can have someone review and 
photograph those at the Bronx warehouse at an earlier time. 
o From your email, it appears that only two items are not located at the Bronx warehouse — both envelopes 
with cash. Please confirm this. We do not need the two "cash" evidence items transported to 500 Pearl. 
o If there are other evidence items housed somewhere other than the Bronx, please let us know what they 
are and where they are. 
• We will be permitted to bring our laptops, and a camera, into 500 Pearl Street; we are happy to seek permission 
from Judge Nathan to do so. 
• Either the FBI can provide the equipment necessary to listen to any of the recordings at 500 Pearl Street or we 
can bring the necessary equipment. If we are to provide the equipment, we will need to know in advance the 
EFTA00015814
--- PAGE 12 ---
formats of each recording so that we can be prepared. You can note that on your Excel spreadsheet by the item 
number by March 29 to give us adequate time to secure the necessary equipment. 
• The FBI can segregate any physical evidence that you deem "highly confidential." You can identify any "highly 
confidential" physical evidence items on your Excel spreadsheets by April 5 (one week before the evidence view). 
If we need to photograph or reproduce any such item for expert evaluation, we will seek leave of court. 
Otherwise, we will not photograph any such items during the review during the week of April 12. This will ensure 
the evidence review proceeds smoothly and there will not be any need to ask permission to photograph on an 
item by item basis. 
• The FBI also can segregate any recordings which we will be able to inspect, but not listen to, during the evidence 
view the week of April 12. You can note such designation on your Excel spreadsheet. If we disagree, we can seek 
leave of the Court in advance. 
• We understand that an FBI Agent and/or AUSA may be present during our physical evidence review at 500 Pearl 
Street but of course must ensure that no recordings are made of our conversations and also ensure that there is a 
separate, secure room in which we can confer with our client during the evidence view without monitoring by the 
government. 
• Please confirm whether all electronic recordings (other than the highly-confidential images and videos described 
below) have previously been produced to us, and if not, please explain which ones were not produced by the 
discovery deadlines last fall and why. 
Highly Confidential Electronic Evidence 
• Can you please explain why 2,100 + 7 "highly confidential" images have not been shared with us yet? It was our 
understanding that you previously provided all "highly confidential" images to our client — and to defense counsel 
— for review at the MDC in November. We are confused about where these previously undisclosed items were 
located and why they have not yet been made available for inspection and review. 
• During the week of April 19, Ms. Maxwell should be produced to 500 Pearl Street to review (with counsel and a 
defense staff member, on the 1 laptop provided) all of the 5,507 electronic images and video marked "highly 
confidential". These should be segregated into the three categories you describe (never-before produced, 
previously produced, and the 7 hard-copy images). 
Please let us know if you will not agree to any of these steps so that we can address the issues with the Court. 
Thank you.

Subject: RE: US v. Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes 
All, 
Attached please find two spreadsheets documenting all physical evidence in the FBI's custody, as well as a corresponding 
discovery cover letter. We are sending a copy of these files to the MDC for your client as well. 
In response to your questions, the FBI has informed me of the following: 
Regarding the Highly Confidential nude/partially nudge images to be reviewed at 500 Pearl: 
EFTA00015815
--- PAGE 13 ---
• There are three categories of these images: 
o Approximately 2,100 electronic images and videos seized from Epstein's electronic devices (which have not 
been previously provided to you) 
o Approximately 3,400 electronic images from discs seized from Epstein's residences in 2019 (which have 
previously been provided to you and your client for review at the MDC) 
o Approximately 7 hard copy nude images located in the file from the FBI Florida office's investigation of 
Epstein (which have not been previously provided to you) 
• The FBI will make all three of those categories available to you. The electronic files will be provided on hard 
drives, and the FBI will provide you with the hard copy images for review as well. 
o All electronic images should be viewable as thumbnails, except those seized from Apple devices, which 
must be viewed using Cellebrite. 
o The Cellebrite software will be provided on the drive for your review of images and videos seized from 
Apple devices. 
o The electronic files have the same metadata on the hard drive that was available when the FBI seized each 
image. For images that were carved or deleted, no metadata was recovered, so none is viewable. For all 
other images, the metadata recovered should be viewable on the hard drive. 
o The approximately 2,100 electronic images and videos seized from Epstein's devices are separated by 
folder to indicate which device each image was seized from. 
• Because these images are considered obscene material, the FBI is not permitted to make duplicates of them, and 
there is a limited number of clean laptops on which these images can be reviewed. As a result, the FBI is only 
able to provide a single laptop for review of these images. 
Regarding the physical evidence: 
• Attached are two lists of all physical items in the FBI's custody relating to this case. The first list relates to items 
associated with the FBI Florida office's investigation of Epstein. The second list relates to items associated with 
the FBI New York office's current investigation. 
• The vast majority of physical evidence in the FBI's custody is located at the FBI's warehouse in the Bronx. Two 
items (18 77 & 1B 79) are located at 26 Federal Plaza, but the case agents can check those items out from 26 
Federal Plaza and bring them to the Bronx warehouse on whatever day you choose to conduct your review so 
that you will have all evidence in one place. 
• The FBI is able to arrange for the defense team to review all physical evidence at the Bronx warehouse under the 
following conditions: 
o The warehouse requires at least two weeks' notice in order to pull all of the items for the entire case and 
place them in a location where a large group of people can view them. 
o The warehouse is open during normal business hours between 9am and 5pm on weekdays. 
o At least two FBI agents and an AUSA will be present at the Bronx warehouse to assist and answer 
questions. 
o The evidence will be placed in a loading dock at the warehouse to provide additional space for the review. 
To ensure that there is sufficient space, please let me know how many members of the defense team 
intend to be physically present for this review. 
o Electronic devices such as cellphones and laptops are not permitted in the warehouse. The defense team 
may bring a digital camera that is not connected to the Internet or a cellular network into the warehouse. 
If the defense team wishes to photograph an item of evidence, the defense will need to inform the agents 
who are present, so that they may confirm that the photographed item is not Highly Confidential based on 
the presence of nudity. 
o Electronic media such as VHS tapes, cassette tapes, and CDs will not be playable at the warehouse. 
• To the extent the defense requests that the FBI bring any physical items to 500 Pearl Street for your client to 
review, the FBI is prepared to bring items that are reasonably sized to 500 Pearl Street. With respect to bulky or 
large items, the defense team should be able to photograph those for your client to review, unless they are 
deemed Highly Confidential, in which case the FBI can make arrangements to transport the item to 500 Pearl 
Street if necessary. 
• The FBI is in the process of confirming that it can provide devices to play all of the electronic media in the case in 
a single location at the FBI's offices in downtown Manhattan. We are also double-checking to confirm that all 
media that does not contain witness statements have already been produced to you and your client in discovery. 
EFTA00015816
--- PAGE 14 ---
The FBI anticipates that we can arrange for you to review all non-witness statement electronic media at the FBI's 
office in downtown Manhattan in approximately three weeks. 
o To the extent you wish to review all of the discs containing photographs, which were seized from Epstein's 
residences in 2019, we note that all of those images have already been produced to you in discovery. For 
your awareness, the FBI has informed me that it took their team several weeks to review all of the images 
on all of those discs. 
Please let me know how you wish to proceed.

Now that the FBI team is back, when do you expect to have answers to all of the questions posed? If I had an idea of 
when you would have answers, it could help me answer your question. 
At a minimum, it would not seem to take too much time to know when someone can open the FBI vault and allow the 
attorneys to make an initial view of the evidence. Also, I understand the FBI did not prepare an inventory of their 
evidence when they seized it from NY and LSJ, so I don't think we need to wait for them to now prepare an inventory 
before we start reviewing evidence. 
Also, when do you believe you will have a response regarding the discovery I requested last Monday? 
Thanks, 
Laura

Counsel, 
The FBI team on this case has been out of the office this week and will not be able to answer all of the questions you 
asked during our Wednesday call until they are back in the office next week. Please let me know if you would like to 
wait until all of those questions can be answered to schedule a day for your client to be brought to 500 Pearl Street to 
review the highly confidential images. My understanding is that the FBI is able to provide at least one laptop containing 
those highly confidential images in time for such a review to take place on Thursday 5/18, but I may not have the 
answers to all of your questions about those images before that date, and I do not know whether you will also be able to 
visit the evidence vault that same week. 
Please let me know how you would like to proceed. I will reach back out once I have answers to your questions.

That is the only excel spreadsheet indexing physical evidence that we have produced in discovery. That spreadsheet 
does not include every physical item currently in the FBI's custody related to this case. For example, the August 20, 2020 
discovery production also included search warrant returns listing the physical items seized by the FBI's New York Office 
during the 2019 searches of Jeffrey Epstein's residences in New York and the U.S Virgin Islands (see Bates range 
SDNY_GM_00166007-SDNY_GM_00166043), but they are not contained in a spreadsheet. 
As a courtesy, I have asked the FBI whether it would be possible to provide us with a similar excel index reflecting the 
physical evidence seized by the FBI's New York Office, though it may take some time to compile such an index.

Counsel, 
In advance of our call tomorrow, I wanted to send a copy of the attached index of physical items in FBI custody from the 
FBI-Miami office, which we previously produced to you as part of our August 21, 2020 discovery production. Also 
included in that August 21, 2020 production were scans of numerous items listed on the index. Those scans can be 
found within Bates range SDNY_GM_00172218-SDNY_GM_00173007. It may be useful to reference some of those 
items during our conversation tomorrow, so I wanted to make sure you were aware of them.

Dear Counsel: 
The Government writes regarding your request to review sixteen (16) discs in the 
possession of the Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI") as part of the file previously maintained 
by the FBI's Palm Beach Resident Agency (the "FBI Florida Office") during its investigation of 
Jeffrey Epstein under evidence number 1B8, Subitem 8 (the "Discs"). As noted in the evidence 
log previously provided to you, the Discs are described in the FBI's evidence system as follows: 
(16) DVD-R discs with printed labels reading, "Palm Beach County 
Sheriffs Office Case # 05-250067 Epstein Encase Files Palm Beach 
PD DVD-R for General VERBATIM DVD Computer Crimes 
Unit." Each disc is also respectively labeled, "Disk 1 of 16," "Disk 
of 16," etc. 
When the FBI's New York Office first received the FBI Florida Office's file regarding its 
investigation of Jeffrey Epstein, the agents working on this case attempted to review all electronic 
media contained in that file, including the Discs. During that review, the case agents were unable 
to open any files contained on the Discs and believed that the files were inoperable. 
EFTA00015823
--- PAGE 2 ---
Page 2 
In preparing for defense counsel in this case to review all physical evidence in the FBI 
Florida Office's file, the Government tried to access the content of these Discs and was similarly 
unable to open those files. However, the Government recognized that the file extensions and sizes 
of those files appeared to be consistent with those of a forensic image of an electronic device. 
With the help of an FBI computer specialist, the Government has learned that the Discs appear to 
contain a forensic image of a computer seized from Jeffrey Epstein's residence in Palm Beach, 
Florida by the Palm Beach Police Department during the execution of a search warrant in or about 
2005 (the "Epstein Computer"). 
The Government has reviewed the 2005 search warrant obtained by the Palm Beach Police 
Department, which was previously produced to you in a discovery production dated October 20, 
2020. While that warrant appears to have authorized the seizure of electronic devices, it does not 
appear to have authorized a search of the content of such devices. Moreover, the Government is 
not aware of any further warrant obtained by local or federal authorities as part of the prior Florida 
Investigation that would authorize a review of the contents of the Epstein Computer. Nor has this 
Office obtained a warrant for the Epstein Computer. Accordingly, the Government does not 
believe it has a lawful basis to review the forensic image of the Epstein Computer contained on 
the Discs. Moreover, and given, among other things, the passage of time since the Epstein 
Computer was seized in 2005, the Government does not intend to obtain a warrant to search the 
Epstein Computer or otherwise review or make use of its contents. As such, because the 
Government lacks authority to review their contents, the Discs are not discoverable in this case, 
and the Government cannot permit you to review the contents of the Discs.' 
Very truly yours, 
AUDREY STRAUSS 
United States Attorney 
Assistant United States Attorneys 
In this respect, the Government is also mindful of the fact that Epstein's estate has repeatedly 
informed the Government that it is unwilling to waive any attorney-client privileges in connection 
devices seized from Epstein during this investigation. As a result, even assuming the Government 
had the authority to review the contents of the Discs, the Government would have to first conduct 
a privilege review before producing any non-privileged material to you. However, because the 
Government has no lawful authority to search the contents, it cannot conduct such a review.

Re: 
In re SDNY Investigation 
Dear Marc and Andrew: 
The Government writes with regard to several matters relevant to the estate of Jeffrey 
Epstein, which we understand to be under the authority of your clients, Darren K. Indyke and 
Richard D. Kahn, as co-executors of the estate and co-trustees of the 1953 Trust Agreement. 
First, the 1953 Trust Agreement, produced on or about November 1, 2019, contains a 
provision, at Section 2.5(B), that, among other things, and in sum and substance, states that to 
provide for the continued maintenance and operations of the assets of the Trust Estate, the Trustees 
shall ensure that all employees of certain entities shall continue to be employed for a period of two 
years following the death of Jeffrey Epstein. It further provides that, "however, the Trustees shall 
have the right [to] terminate the employment or the engagement of any such employees or service 
providers if and at such times as the Trustees determine in their discretion that there is cause for 
such termination." Such cause includes, among other things, "insubordination, breach of duty, 
[and] disloyalty." We request that the Trustees confirm their understanding that whatever the 
scope of that provision may be, it is not intended to and will not be used to suggest that any current 
or former employee who chooses to meet with or provide information to law enforcement as part 
of any ongoing investigation will be retaliated against in any way, or will lose any employment 
benefit, or any other benefit, inheritance, or bequest, under the Trust Agreement. We also ask you 
to confirm that this provision has not been invoked for any such reason to date. 
Second, as you are aware, Ghislaine Maxwell has been charged with crimes relating to the 
sexual abuse of minor girls and perjury in United States v. Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN). Should 
she be convicted, she will be subject to the mandatory victim restitution provisions associated with 
certain of the criminal charges against her. Accordingly, we request that your clients confirm 
whether they have, to date, made any distribution to Maxwell and, if not, further confirm that they 
EFTA00015838
--- PAGE 2 ---
July 23, 2020 
Page 2 
will notify the Government in advance of any disbursement to her during the pendency of the 
criminal case. 
Finally, in connection with the prosecution of Ms. Maxwell, the Government expects to 
produce certain discovery materials to the defense, including certain materials obtained or seized 
in connection with the case against Jeffrey Epstein (the "Seized Materials"). These materials will 
be produced subject to a Court-ordered protective order. In connection with the Government's 
anticipated production of the Seized Materials in the pending case, please advise whether the co-
executors—in their capacity as representatives of the estate—take a position on whether, generally 
and at this time, any items within the Seized Materials remain subject to a potential claim of 
attorney-client privilege, or, in the alternative, whether the estate is prepared to waive any claim 
of privilege with respect to the Seized Materials, for purposes of the review and production of 
discovery in the charged case.

Great, thanks. And yeah if on Monday you could please double-check both the spreadsheet question and the blank files, 
that would be great so we can close the loop on our end. Thanks again, and have a good weekend.

I don't have the evidence in front of me, but it is probably accurate. It is not unusual for the software to find such 
files. I will review Monday to make sure. As to your questions from last night, the sheet should be 
comprehensive. I only recall 1 addition, but I am sure that what I have is reflected in the sheet. As for the items 
in dark grey, there are 2 servers with multiple drives. Some of those drives have physically failed. We have to get 
them to one of our HQ specialists for recovery. Since they are physically broken, data recovery may or may not 
be possible. It can be a very long process. We will get that moving ASAP. Need anything else, let me know.

in addition to the pending questions below, we've been advised by the vendor that is reviewing the initial seven devices 
(that were provided on a per-device extraction basis, as previously discussed) that those materials include approximately 
71,000 documents that are zero bytes (i.e., empty files). They are listed in the attached spreadsheet. 
Is that accurate? Or does that reflect some issue with the extraction process?

This is very helpful, thank you. Comparing this to the prior spreadsheet, and leaving aside the "Nothing for Southern" 
designations as well as the NYC numbers that look like they're for the desktops that held the actual drives we're looking at 
(such as NYC024385, 387, 389, 391, and 393, and NYC027909), I think there are just three additional devices listed here 
that weren't on the spreadsheet you previously sent. I have those as: 
1. 
NYC024328 (row 10) 
2. 
NYC024367 (row 62) 
3. 
NYC027910 (row 96) 
Could you please confirm that I have those additions correct, and that I'm not missing any? And it looks like all of those 
were included in the drive you provided today. 
I also see there are some drives that are still being processed, including NYC024376 through 380 and several drives in 
NYC024395 — could you please let us know what that means? 
Thanks very much, and we'll circle back if any issues with anything we received today, which should get to 
in the 
next day or two. 
thanks again,

Here is the up to date spreadsheet. I color coded things to hopefully make it easier. There are 5 items I have to 
get you (as we discussed this morning) Those should take another day or 2, so looking at Monday/Tuesday for that. Any 
questions, let me know.

I was contacted by BOP MCC NY Warden 
this afternoon and he asked whether it was ok for the 
MCC to return to the normal usage of the cell in the Special Housing Unit where Jeffrey Epstein was housed 
and the incident occurred. He mentioned that he recalled being told by someone at some point it was ok to 
begin using the cell again to house inmates but wants to confirm it is ok to do so before reopening the cell for 
normal use. I told Warden 
that I would check with the Investigative Team and get back to him next 
week. Please let me know if he should continue to keep the cell secured and unoccupied or if he can begin 
using the cell to house inmates. Thank you all and have a nice weekend.

There was a miscommunication on our end internally. There was no

already one being used. We are creating a line as secure as possible.

Good morning-
In my email of 8/9 (see below), I raised concerns regarding use of the 
MDC Zoom 
platform because it does not preclude third parties with access 
information to the Zoom "Courtrooms" 
from interfering (inadvertently or intentionally) with Ms. Maxwell's 
privileged communication. 
That concern manifested itself today when third parties accessed the 
Zoom room used by Ms. Maxwell and counsel. 
This breach was reported to, and I believe witnessed by, MDC staff, 
including technician 
This severely impacts confidential privileged attorney-client 
communication and is especially concerning in this 
high-profile case. 
I am requesting that we immediately revert back to the WebEx platform 
controlled by Cohen & Gresser. 
Please contact me to discuss.

Yup, attached! It's short and sweet. And also attaching the Government's brief on it. 
It also looks like there may be another opinion on this issue that's currently under seal, but which is scheduled to

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 298 Filed 06/04/21 Page 1 of 6 
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
United States of America, 
—v—
Ghislaine Maxwell, 
Defendant. 
USDC SONY 
DOCUMENT 
ELECTRONICALLY FILED 
DOC //: 
DATE FILED: 6/4/21 
20-CR-330 (MN) 
ORDER 
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
On April 27, 2021, the Court denied Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell's request for 
authorization to serve a subpoena to Boies Schiller Flexner LLP. Dkt. No. 252. The Court 
requested the Government's views as to three of those requests: Request 9, which sought 
production of Minor Victim-2's entire diary from her teenage years; Request 10, which targeted 
a pair of boots that Minor Victim-2 allegedly received as a gift from Jeffrey Epstein and 
Maxwell; and Request 11, which sought original versions of certain photographs. Id. The 
Government submitted its views on May 4, 2021. Dkt. No. 269. It supplemented its letter on 
May 6, 2021. Dkt. No. 271. The Defendant filed a response on May 12, 2021. Having 
considered the parties' views, the Defendant's request is denied in full. 
As noted, Request 9 seeks the original copy of a journal from an alleged victim from 
when she was a teenager. Maxwell received copies of some of the pages in the journal from the 
Government pursuant to Rule 16, but the Government represents that it does not have access to 
the entire journal. In those pages, Minor Victim-2 describes a trip to New York in which she 
spent time with Epstein and, among other things, visited his residence. Minor Victim-2 also 
describes her impression of Epstein at the time. There is no indication that Maxwell is 
mentioned there or anywhere else in the journal.

EFTA00015859

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 298 Filed 06/04/21 Page 2 of 6 
Maxwell appears to proffer two theories of relevance as to the entire journal. While she 
studiously avoids using the word, one such theory relates to impeachment. As this Court has 
noted, the potential impeachment of a witness does not provide grounds for issuance or 
enforcement of a Rule 17(c) subpoena because such materials would only become relevant after 
a witness has testified. United States v. Slcelos, No. 15-CR-317 (KMW), 2018 WL 2254538, at 
*2 (S.D.N.Y. May 17, 2018), aff'd, 988 F.3d 645 (2d Cir. 2021) (collecting cases). 
The other theory of relevance that Maxwell proffers is that if the rest of the journal does 
not mention her, the journal as a whole may serve as exculpatory evidence. At best, the theory 
amounts to little more than a "fishing expedition," which is not the proper use of Rule 17(c). See 
United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 698-70 (1974). In any event, the argument is too 
speculative to meet the standard set forth in Nixon. To begin with, the request appears to be 
overbroad; under Rule 17(c), the moving party must show that all of the requested material is 
relevant. Cf. United States v. Pena, No. 15-CR-551 (MN), 2016 WL 8735699, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. 
Feb. 12, 2016). It appears from the briefing that the diary includes entries from before Minor 
Victim-2's first time meeting Epstein or Maxwell. Maxwell does not explain why the absence of 
references to her in those entries would be relevant, and she provides no other basis as to the 
relevance of any portions of the diary that precede her meeting Epstein or Maxwell. And here, 
too, the theory that the rest of the journal contradicts Minor Victim-2's anticipated testimony as 
to specific incidents is, in its nature, targeted at impeaching the alleged victim's anticipated 
testimony. 
In addition, Maxwell does not plausibly establish the relevance of the rest of the diary 
other than the pages she has already received. BSF has represented that the rest of the journal 
does not discuss Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein. Dkt. No. 191 at 5. The Government has similarly 
EFTA00015860
--- PAGE 3 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 298 Filed 06/04/21 Page 3 of 6 
represented that it understands that Minor Victim-2 stopped writing in the diary shortly after 
meeting Jeffrey Epstein and that the diary, as a result, has no entries relating to any later trips she 
took with Epstein. Dkt. No. 204 at 187. Maxwell does not provide any nonconclusory basis to 
doubt these representations. So while it is undisputed that Maxwell is not referenced in the 
diary—BSF, the Government, and Maxwell all agree on this point—the absence of references 
alone, without regard to whether the diary contains entries relevant to the incidents about which 
Minor Victim-2 is expected to testify at trial, does not establish any relevance except as to 
potential impeachment. 
Nor do any of Maxwell's additional arguments establish the relevance of the rest of the 
journal. She points to the fairness doctrine and Rules 106 and Rule 612 of the Federal Rules of 
Evidence as providing additional bases for the propriety of the request under Rule 17(c). She 
cites cases regarding the fairness doctrine in the context of attorney-client privilege that have no 
application to the issue presently before the Court. Furthermore, to the extent she makes an 
argument under Rule 106 or Rule 612, the argument is premature. Even assuming that Rule 106 
and Rule 612 could provide grounds for admissibility and relevance at trial, that would only 
ripen at trial if portions of the journal are introduced and admitted. Her Rule 612 argument is 
further strained by the fact that, even if that rule applied, it would not entitle the Defendant to 
production of the entire journal. The Rule provides that "[i]f the producing party claims that the 
writing includes unrelated matter, the court must examine the writing in camera, delete any 
unrelated portion, and order that the rest be delivered to the adverse party." Fed. R. Evid. 
612(b). Here, both the Government and BSF, on behalf of Minor Victim-2, have asserted that 
the rest of the journal is unrelated. In any event, none of these principles establish the relevance 
of the journal beyond impeachment, and all of the arguments presented to the contrary are 
EFTA00015861
--- PAGE 4 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 298 Filed 06/04/21 Page 4 of 6 
meritless. Lastly, Maxwell's theory that a forensic analysis could reveal the date that the journal 
was written and whether it had been altered is for impeachment of anticipated authentication 
testimony. Moreover, it is entirely speculative and unsubstantiated. Maxwell provides no actual 
reason to doubt the journal's authenticity. In her May 12, 2021 letter, Maxwell claims that two 
copies of one of the pages are "obviously, and noticeably, different." The difference, which is 
not explained in the letter, is neither obvious nor noticeable to this Court. Indeed, the writing 
and handwriting in the two exhibits certainly look identical. At most, one version appears to be a 
photograph of the page in the journal (Exhibit A), while the other appears to be a photocopy of 
the same page (Exhibit B). Maxwell fails to identify any actual differences. Separately, here 
again Maxwell's arguments sound in impeachment of anticipated authentication testimony. For 
all of the reasons stated above, the Court concludes that a Rule 17(c) subpoena is not the proper 
vehicle for Request 9. 
Request 10 seeks production of a pair of black boots that Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein 
allegedly gave to an alleged victim. The Government has indicated that it has requested that 
BSF produce the boots to the FBI and that, when the boots are in the FBI's possession, the 
Government will promptly make them available to the defense for examination and use at trial. 
Maxwell contends that the Court should nonetheless order the boots' production to the defense. 
The argument is meritless. Rule I7(c) is not the proper mechanism for discovery from third 
parties where the sought-after item is "otherwise procurable reasonably in advance of trial." 
Nixon, 418 U.S. at 698-700. That is the case here: The Government has represented that the 
defense will be able to inspect the boots before trial. The Defendant's request is therefore denied 
as moot. If the Government fails to make the boots available for inspection within a reasonable 
EFTA00015862
--- PAGE 5 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 298 Filed 06/04/21 Page 5 of 6 
timeframe, the Defendant may make an application to the Court to compel the Government to 
adhere to its representation. 
Request 11 seeks production of the original versions of certain photographs of the alleged 
victim. Maxwell seeks these materials to inspect them prior to trial in order to investigate their 
authenticity. In its May 6 letter, the Government indicated that the original versions of a subset 
of the photographs are in the FBI's possession, and the Government will make those photographs 
available to the defense for inspection upon request. The Court agrees with the Government that 
the request is moot as to those photographs. Again, to the extent that the Government fails to 
comply with its representation that it will make those photographs available to the defense upon 
request, the defense may make an application to the Court. 
As to the remaining photographs, the request is denied on the basis that the defense has 
failed to establish the relevance of the original versions of the photographs. The defense already 
has photocopies or scanned versions of the photographs in question. But the defense proffers 
that it seeks the original versions of these photographs in order to determine whether they are 
genuine. The only discernible theory of relevance as to this request is impeachment. Maxwell 
does not set forth any other nonconclusory basis for their relevance. And again, because 
impeachment evidence falls outside the scope of Rule 17(c), the request fails to meet Nixon's 
relevance requirement. But even assuming that impeachment could permissibly establish 
relevance, the argument fails because Maxwell does not yet know the scope of the victim's 
testimony or whether it will implicate the photographs. 
I. 
Conclusion 
The Defendant's motion for an order authorizing the subpoena pursuant to Rule 17(c)(3) 
is DENIED.

Re: 
United States v. Ghislaine Marvel!, S2 20 Cr. 330 (MN) 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
The Government respectfully submits this letter in connection with the Court's Order of 
April 27, 2021, regarding the defendant's request for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to 
Rule 17(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure for records from Boies Schiller Flexner 
LLP ("BSF"). In the Order, the Court directed the Government to notify the Court of its views as 
to Requests 9 through 11. For the reasons set forth below, the Government respectfully submits 
that Requests 9 and 11 should be denied, and the Court should reserve decision with respect to 
Request 10, which the Government expects may be rendered moot. 
I. 
Applicable Law 
As the Court explained in its Order, a defendant seeking material pursuant to a Rule 17(c) 
subpoena bears the burden of satisfying the standard in United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683 
(1974). Pursuant to that standard, a Rule 17(c) subpoena "should not issue unless it meets three 
criteria: `(1) relevancy, (2) admissibility, (3) specificity.'" United States v. Binday, 908 F. Supp. 
2d 485, 491 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (quoting Nixon, 418 U.S. at 700).

Page 2 
The Nixon test is enforced strictly. "The party requesting the subpoena must also show 
that the information sought is `not otherwise procurable reasonably in advance of trial by exercise 
of due diligence,' that 'the party cannot properly prepare for trial without such production,' and 
that `the application is made in good faith and is not intended as a general "fishing expedition. 
United States v. Ulbricht, 858 F.3d 71, 109 (2d Cir. 2017) (quoting Nixon, 418 U.S. at 699-700), 
abrogated on other grounds as recognized by United States v. Chambers, 751 F. App'x 44, 46 & 
n.1 (2d Cir. 2018) (summary order). It is not sufficient for a party to show only that the subpoenaed 
documents "are potentially relevant or admissible." United States v. Wey, 252 F. Supp. 3d 237, 
254 (S.D.N.Y. 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, as the Court has explained, 
impeachment material is not "relevant" within the meaning of Nixon "until after the witness 
testifies." (Order at 5). See Nixon, 418 U.S. at 701 ("[g]enerally, the need for evidence to impeach 
witnesses is insufficient to require its production in advance of trial" (citations omitted)). Finally, 
Rule 17 by its terms prohibits subpoenas aimed at statements "of a witness or a prospective 
witness." See Fed. R. Crim. P. 1700. 
II. 
Discussion 
Although the Government has not seen the proposed subpoena, the Government 
understands that Request 9 seeks the complete diary of Minor Victim-2, Request 10 seeks a pair 
of boots given to Minor Victim-2, and Request 11 seeks a series of photographs. Requests 9 and 
should be denied. The Government is working to moot Request 10, so the Court should reserve 
decision on that request until it can be denied as moot. 
A. Request 9 
The Government understands that Request 9 calls for Minor Victim-2's entire diary from 
her teenage years. This request is improper under Rule 17 in three respects. 
EFTA00015866
--- PAGE 3 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 269 Filed 05/04/21 Page 3 of 9 
Page 3 
First, the defendant has not adequately identified why the diary is relevant beyond the 
portions of the diary the defense has already received. See Ulbricht, 858 F.3d at 109 (explaining 
that Rule 17(c) is not appropriate for evidence that is "otherwise procurable" (internal quotation 
marks omitted)). BSF represents that "all potentially relevant pages were produced from this 
journal to the Defendant in civil discovery in another matter." (3122/21 Letter from BSF, Dkt. No. 
191 at 5). The Government also obtained and produced seven pages of the diary to the defendant 
in discovery. (Mot. for a Bill of Particulars and Pretrial Disclosures, Dkt. No. 148 at 10). 
The defendant argues that the entire diary is exculpatory because it contains no reference 
to her. (4/2/21 Letter from Def., Dkt. No. 244 at 9). But the Government and Minor Victim-2 
have acknowledged the absence of references to the defendant from the start, and Minor Victim-2 
is expected to testify to that fact at trial. (See Gov't Omnibus Response, Dkt. No. 204 at 187 (citing 
Mem. in Opp. to Def.'s Renewed Motion for Release, Dkt. No. 100 at 11 n.2.); 3/22/21 Letter from 
BSF, Dkt. No. 191 at 5). The defendant earlier moved to compel the Government to obtain and 
produce the diary to her, a motion the Court has denied. (Opinion & Order, Dkt. No. 207 at 29). 
As the Government explained in its opposition to that motion, the Government understands that 
Minor Victim-2 stopped writing in her diary shortly after meeting Jeffrey Epstein, so there are no 
entries regarding her later trip with Epstein, during which she met the defendant. (See Gov't 
Omnibus Response, Dkt. No. 204 at 187). The victim provided the Government with her entries 
relating to Epstein, which the Government in turn produced to the defense. (Id.). The remainder 
of the diary consists of Minor Victim-2's unrelated personal diary entries, and the defendant has 
not explained and cannot explain why she needs to review those entries to establish a fact that the 
EFTA00015867
--- PAGE 4 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 269 Filed 05/04/21 Page 4 of 9 
Page 4 
Government has acknowledged. In other words, there will be no dispute at trial that Minor Victim-
did not write about the defendant in her diary.' 
The cases the defendant cites are inapposite. For instance, in United States v. Cheung Kin 
Ping, 555 F.2d 1069 (2d Cir. 1977), the parties learned that a cooperating witness kept a diary, 
which was largely written in Chinese, while the witness was still on cross-examination. Id. at 
1078. The witness turned over his diary, but after observing that the "defense was examining his 
diary, . . . he requested that this not be done." Id. While the parties were discussing how to review 
the diary, including for Brady material, the diary was returned to the witness. It was only given to 
the defense for examination after "roughly five days" in the witness's possession. Id. at 1079. 
Accordingly, in that case, a diary that had never been evaluated for Brady material—or any other 
material—was taken from a witness in the middle of the witness's cross-examination, then 
returned to him for five days. The Second Circuit found that those events "created a serious risk 
that significant material would be destroyed or tampered with." Id. Here, in contrast, the diary 
contains no relevant material—in fact, that is the defendant's very thesis. See also White v. 
McKinley, 519 F.3d 806, 814 (8th Cir. 2008) (explaining, in a § 1983 case, that the plaintiff had 
alleged bad faith by stating that a law enforcement officer in a child molestation case "deliberately 
steer[ed] the investigation to benefit his love interest," in part by "fail[ing] to preserve the alleged 
victim's diary which did not corroborate the molestation allegations," which in turn "deprived [the 
defendant] of his right to a fair trial, in part, because he could not testify about the diary without 
waiving his right not to testify"); United States v. Rios, No. 88 Cr. 186, 1989 WL 9289, at *2 
' For similar reasons, the entire diary, full of Minor Vicitm-2's personal and unrelated information, 
would not be admissible at trial. See Nixon, 418 U.S. 700 (requiring that a Rule 17(c) subpoena 
target "admissib[le]" evidence). 
EFTA00015868

Page 5 
(N.D.N.Y. Feb. 6, 1989) (reaching the unremarkable result that an "undercover agent's diary" is 
"not discoverable in and of itself" except "to the extent that this diary contains" Brady material). 
Alternatively, the defendant states that she needs to inspect the "entire journal" to 
"establish whether the journal is authentic and complete and whether or not spoilation has 
occurred." (4/2/21 Letter from Def., Dkt. No. 244 at 9). "This examination," she continues, 
"requires the services of a qualified forensic document examiner." (Id.) This argument lacks 
merit. The defendant's bare assertion that authenticity might somehow be in doubt is hardly a 
sufficiently detailed explanation of relevance and admissibility to justify a subpoena for a minor 
victim's personal journal. The defendant does not identify any basis for doubting the authenticity 
of the documents, which the Government expects that Minor Victim-2 will be able to properly 
authenticate at trial. Nor does the defendant identify what kind of examiner she intends to use, 
what kind of examination will occur, or how that examination might bear on the journal's 
authenticity. See Wey, 252 F. Supp. 3d at 253 (explaining that the "items sought cannot merely be 
potentially relevant or admissible. Rather, they must be shown to be relevant and admissible at 
the time the subpoena is sought." (internal quotation marks omitted)); see also United States v. 
Skelos, No. 15-CR-317 (KMW), 2018 WL 2254538, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May 17, 2018), aff'd, 988 
F.3d 645 (2d Cir. 2021) ("[A] criminal subpoena should not be used as 'a discovery device,' but 
instead should be used only as 'a mechanism for obtaining specific admissible evidence.'" (quoting 
United States v. Barnes, No. 04 Cr. 186 (SCR), 2008 WL 9359654, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 2, 2008)). 
"Conclusory statements," like the defendant's here, are "insufficient to satisfy the Nixon 
requirements." Barnes, 2008 WL 9359654, at *3.2
In addition to the explicit bases identified in her letter on the subpoena and described above, 
elsewhere the defendant has made clear that she seeks the diary for impeachment purposes. (See 
Mot. for a Bill of Particulars and Pretrial Disclosures, Dkt. No. 148 at 10; 3/22/21 Letter from 
EFTA00015869
--- PAGE 6 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 269 Filed 05/04/21 Page 6 of 9 
Page 6 
Second, the request in insufficiently specific. To satisfy the specificity prong, a Rule 17(c) 
subpoena must be able to "reasonably specify the information contained or believed to be 
contained in the documents sought rather than merely hop[e] that something useful will turn up." 
Barnes, 2008 WL 9359654, at *4 (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted); see, e.g., 
United States v. Avenatti, No. 19 Cr. 373 (PGG), 2020 WL 508682, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 31, 2020). 
The defendant's request for the entire diary is likely to sweep in a significant period of Minor 
Victim-2's life before Minor Victim-2 met Epstein or the defendant—all of which is irrelevant. 
To justify this overbreadth, the defendant identifies two reasons she needs to review the 
diary in full: to demonstrate the absence of references to the defendant, and to establish the diary's 
authenticity. (4/2/21 Letter from Def., Dkt. No. 244 at 9). As to the former, there is no probative 
value in showing that diary entries before the defendant had ever met Epstein or the defendant 
contain no references to Epstein or the defendant, and in any event, the Government has conceded 
the point. As to the latter, the defendant offers only the conclusory statement that review of the 
entire diary is necessary. That is insufficient, as explained above. 
Third, the request is barred by Rule 17(h). That section prohibits the use of Rule 17 to 
"subpoena a statement of a witness or of a prospective witness," Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(h), explaining 
that such issues are governed by Rule 26.2. The diary is a set of recorded statements by Minor 
Victim-2. To the extent it should be produced, that production is governed by Rule 16, Rule 26.2, 
Brady, and Giglio, but not Rule 17. See, e.g., United States v. Carton, 17 Cr. 680 (CM), 2018 WL 
5818107, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 19, 2018) (rejecting a request for a personnel file because the 
BSF, Dkt. No. 191 at 5 ("The Defendant also clearly seeks to use the journal for impeachment 
purposes, as highlighted in a prior filing in a recently dismissed civil action Ms. Farmer filed 
against the Defendant.")). But as the Court has recently explained, Rule 17 is not a tool to obtain 
impeachment material in advance of trial. (Order at 5). 
EFTA00015870

Page 7 
individual "is a prospective witness in this case; the Government will provide Carton with his 
3500, Jencks and Giglio material by the deadline set by the Court"); United States v. Yudong Zhu, 
No. 13 Cr. 761 (VM), 2014 WL 5366107, at *3 & n.3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 14, 2014) (rejecting a 
subpoena request under Rule 17(h) even though the records were not in the Government's 
possession). Here, the Government has discharged its obligations already by providing the 
defendant with the relevant pages from the diary, and Rule 17(h) bars a search for additional 
statements. 
The defendant's theories miss the mark because Request 9, at its core, is precisely the sort 
of "fishing expedition" that Nixon prohibits. 418 U.S. at 700. Accordingly, Request 9 should be 
denied. 
B. Request 10 
The Government understands Request 10 to seek a pair of boots purchased by the defendant 
and Jeffrey Epstein for Minor Victim-2. The defendant states that she would like to examine the 
boots in order to "identify the make and provenance of the boots." (4/2/21 Letter from Def., Dkt. 
No. 244 at 11). This appears to be an attempt to use the boots to impeach Minor Victim-2's 
testimony, shrouded again in a conclusory claim about the need for authentication. 
For 
substantially the reasons set forth above with respect to the diary, the Government respectfully 
submits such a claim is meritless under Nixon. 
However, and although the Government is not obligated to do so, the Government has 
requested that BSF provide the boots to the Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI"). BSF has 
indicated that Minor Victim-2 will likely agree to do so. When the boots are in the FBI's custody, 
the Government intends to make them available promptly to the defense for examination and use 
at trial, and will so notify the Court, which should moot Request 10. The Government submits, 
EFTA00015871
--- PAGE 8 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 269 Filed 05/04/21 Page 8 of 9 
Page 8 
thus, that the Court need not resolve Request 10 at this time, as the Court will likely be able to 
deny it as moot in the near term. 
C. Request 11 
Request 11 appears to seek a series of photographs. The Government's understanding is 
that the defendant already has copies of those photographs. (See 4/2/21 Letter from Def., Dkt. No. 
244 at 11 ("[C]opies were produced by BSF in civil litigation.")). It also appears that the 
Government also produced copies of some of these photographs in Rule 16 discovery. In any 
event, and again although the Government is not obligated to do so, the Government requested 
that BSF provide it with copies of the complete set of requested photographs, which it has obtained 
and produced to the defendant. 
Remaining at issue, then, are only the original versions of the photographs. 
The 
Government understands from BSF that the photographs were all taken on film and are not digital 
photographs. Accordingly, the originals are physical photographs, not digital files. The defense 
subpoena for these original photographs should be denied, at least unless and until the defendant 
provides further justification for the need for and entitlement to the originals. Because the 
defendant already has copies of the photographs, the defendant must explain how her request for 
the originals can satisfy the Nixon test without being "otherwise procurable." 418 U.S. at 699. 
The defendant suggests that she needs the originals to identify the "dates of creation or any 
other specifics." (4/2/21 Letter from Def., Dkt. No. 244 at II). It is entirely unclear what "other 
specifics" refers to, but as noted above, the Government understands that these photographs were 
taken on film, such that the originals would generally not contain metadata regarding the date or 
other information regarding when they were taken. And in any event, the defendant has not 
explained the relevance or admissibility of this information—and specifically, whether it would

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 269 Filed 05/04/21 Page 9 of 9 
Page 9 
be used for impeachment, authentication, or another purpose. Accordingly, Request 11 should be 
denied. 
III. 
Conclusion 
For the foregoing reasons, the Court should deny Requests 9 and 11. The Court should 
reserve decision with respect to Request 10 until the Government obtains the boots and makes 
them available for inspection by the defendant, at which time Request 10 will be moot.

Than you tor your interest in the case of U.S. v. Jeffrey Epstein. Attorney General Barr's chief of staff 
has forwarded your questions and insights to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, as 
the investigation that resulted in Jeffrey Epstein's July arrest was conducted by our office and the New York 
Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Your questions and concerns have been forwarded to the 
appropriate people here in our office. As I'm sure you can appreciate, we will be extremely limited in what we 
can tell you about the ongoing investigation. You may nevertheless feel free to email me with any additional 
information or questions, and I will forward them to the appropriate people here.

"Mark S. Cohen" 
Bobbi, 
I just spoke with MDC legal counsel. Below are the responses to your concerns: 
• MDC legal confirmed that since the beginning of the pandemic, MDC inmates in general population have been 
permitted out of their cells for no more than 3 hours per day. For approximately the past month, MDC inmates in 
general population have been permitted out of their cells for no more than 30 minutes per day due to a lockdown at 
the institution. When that lockdown is lifted, inmates will still be permitted out of their cells no more than 3 hours 
per day while the pandemic persists. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell has far more hours out of her cell than any other 
inmate in the MDC at this time. The MDC will not further expand that time. As I previously noted, if general 
population inmates eventually end up receiving more than 13 hours per day out of their cells, I will ask that Ms. 
Maxwell receive the same amount of time. 
• I have again asked MDC legal counsel if Ms. Maxwell may use the laptop on weekends. MDC legal counsel 
indicated they would pass that request up their chain and would circle back to me with a response. 
• MDC legal counsel confirmed that no staff member has ever directed Ms. Maxwell to remain in a particular location 
within her isolation cell. They confirmed that staff understand that no such directions should be given. 
• MDC legal counsel confirmed that Ms. Maxwell has continued to have access to the laptop 13 hours per day every 
weekday. That access has been documented, and MDC legal counsel is not aware of any restrictions on Ms. 
Maxwell's use of the laptop during those times. 
• MDC legal counsel confirmed that staff absolutely cannot see Ms. Maxwell when she showers and do not record her 
when she showers. They indicated that Ms. Maxwell has two shower curtains that cover her when she showers 
such that only her feet are visible when she is in the shower. 
• MDC legal counsel confirmed that staff have not observed any condensation on the walls of Ms. Maxwell's isolation 
cell. The most recent temperature reading from Ms. Maxwell's isolation cell, which was taken last night, indicated 
the cell was 72.8 degrees. Ms. Maxwell currently has three blankets in her cell and is the only inmate in the entire 
institution that is permitted to have a third blanket in her cell. 
• MDC legal counsel indicated that Ms. Maxwell is patted down when she is moved, just like any other inmate. She is 
wanded once per week when she receives a body scan. MDC legal counsel confirmed that staff do not put their 
fingers inside of Ms. Maxwell's (or any other inmate's) mouth. MDC legal counsel is inquiring as to the frequency 
of searches during which Ms. Maxwell is required to lower her mask and open her mouth and will circle back to 
me with that information. They understand my request that those searches be kept to a minimum. MDC legal 
counsel (and I) have never heard of in-and-behind ear searches. Would you be able to explain what that term refers 
to, please? 
• MDC legal counsel confirmed that Ms. Maxwell's cell is searched no more than once per day during weekdays only. 
They further confirmed that the searchers make reasonable efforts to replace any moved items where they were 
originally located (in other words, the searches do not include a "toss" of the cell). They also confirmed that staff 
do not read any of Ms. Maxwell's legal papers. 
• MDC legal counsel indicated that the institution has been having some delays in mail delivery generally. They asked 
whether you can please provide the name of the sender of the certified mail you referenced so that they can attempt 
to locate that mail. 
Best,

Good evening, 
EFTA00015884
--- PAGE 3 ---
We hope you and your family had a joyful holiday. 
In response to your 12/14 email, we are requesting that Ms. Maxwell be permitted to use the 
laptop, in lieu of the MDC computer„ during the typical length of time other inmates are permitted 
out of their cells (our understanding is 6 am - 9:30 pm daily, extended to 10:30 pm on weekends.) 
The voluminous discovery is easier to access and review on the laptop. The MDC computer turns 
off every two hours and is not capable of opening all documents, and volume of discovery 
may be too taxing for the operating system. 
We also want to bring to your attention some of the ongoing issues concerning Ms. Maxwell's 
conditions and restrictions. 
The constant rotation of security staff results in inconsistency of rules and restrictions, the current 
shift being unnecessarily restrictive, punitive, and threatening. 
Ms. Maxwell is ordered to remain in specific locations within her isolation cell 
to accommodate capture on the handheld camera, restricting her use of an already small 
confinement area. 
Her use of the laptop has been restricted. 
She is invasively surveilled while showering. 
Her cell is cold and precipitation accumulates on the concrete block walls. 
Over the holiday weekend, a third blanket, used by Ms. Maxwell to keep herself warm, was 
removed leaving her cold; and she now has the onset of a cold. 
The blanket was returned the next day, after complaint was made by counsel. 
The open-mouth, wanding, pat-down, and in-and-behind ear searches continue, 
with more frequently than other inmates are searched. 
Her cell and legal papers are searched multiple times a day, a disruption to the organization of her 
legal work and an invasion into her privileged work product. 
She has not received daily newspapers for almost 3 weeks, and has not received certified mail 
(return receipts indicating delivery to MDC on 12/17) and non-certified mail for more than a week. 
We will keep you apprised of our concerns. 
Your assistance is appreciated. 
Best-
Bobbi

I understand you're supposed to be filing a response today (by 5:00?) to a defense motion to have Maxwell 
released to the general population at MDC, or at least to be detained under conditions they say would allow her 
greater access to a computer and the opportunity to review discovery materials? Main (OPA) is keenly interested 
because of the AG's response last summer to Epstein's suicide and his bow to overhaul BOP and ensure inmate 
safety, so a guy down there asked if we could send him what you file as soon as you do. (Apparently the AG is 
getting questions from Congressional Republicans about what's being done to ensure Maxwell's safety.)

Hmm. Seems like may be we should reach out in the first instance given that it's the crim div chief? 
Also, team never responded on the draft of the letter. Have you heard anything from them? I don't think there's any way 
we get it filed by Friday at this point, but I suppose there is no magic to that date.

—Thanks again for your help on this a few weeks ago. We've since had a number of productive conversations with 
the folks at OPR you pointed us to, and we think it would be helpful to also make contact with someone at SDFL purely for 
the purpose of ascertaining what hard-copy materials they still have related to the case down there and how we could 
best arrange to obtain and review copies. We have had very limited contact with 
an AUSA in the SDFL civil 
division who we understand was the primary point of contact on issues related to the CVRA litigation. Do you know, does 
he remain the best point of contact for the issues we hope to discuss, or is there someone else in that office we should 
reach out to?

Among our questions was who, whether at ODAG, SDFL, or NDGA we should be in touch with at this point 
regarding documents. I also know OPR did a significant document collection last year. 
We will reach back to OPR, but if there is a particular point of contact at SDFL or NDGA on issues related to document

M— Hope all is well. We had spoken last summer, after the Epstein case was charged, about some potential 
document/discovery requests related to the SDFL investigation and the NPA, in particular. Those conversations were 
largely at mooted at the time by Epstein's death, but as I'm sure you know, we've recently charged Ghislaine Maxwell and, 
anticipating potentially similar issues, we were hoping to revisit those conversations. Do you have time later this week 
for a quick call? If so, please let us know what might work for you.

Good evening, 
We hope you and your family had a joyful holiday. 
In response to your 12/14 email, we are requesting that Ms. Maxwell be permitted to use the 
laptop, in lieu of the MDC computer„ during the typical length of time other inmates are permitted 
out of their cells (our understanding is 6 am - 9:30 pm daily, extended to 10:30 pm on weekends.) 
The voluminous discovery is easier to access and review on the laptop. The MDC computer turns 
off every two hours and is not capable of opening all documents, and volume of discovery 
may be too taxing for the operating system. 
We also want to bring to your attention some of the ongoing issues concerning Ms. Maxwell's 
conditions and restrictions. 
The constant rotation of security staff results in inconsistency of rules and restrictions, the current 
shift being unnecessarily restrictive, punitive, and threatening. 
Ms. Maxwell is ordered to remain in specific locations within her isolation cell 
to accommodate capture on the handheld camera, restricting her use of an already small 
confinement area. 
Her use of the laptop has been restricted. 
She is invasively surveilled while showering. 
Her cell is cold and precipitation accumulates on the concrete block walls. 
Over the holiday weekend, a third blanket, used by Ms. Maxwell to keep herself warm, was 
removed leaving her cold; and she now has the onset of a cold. 
The blanket was returned the next day, after complaint was made by counsel. 
The open-mouth, wanding, pat-down, and in-and-behind ear searches continue, 
with more frequently than other inmates are searched. 
Her cell and legal papers are searched multiple times a day, a disruption to the organization of her 
legal work and an invasion into her privileged work product. 
She has not received daily newspapers for almost 3 weeks, and has not received certified mail 
(return receipts indicating delivery to MDC on 12/17) and non-certified mail for more than a week. 
We will keep you apprised of our concerns. 
Your assistance is appreciated. 
Best-
Bobbi

Subject: RE: Disparities in Counsel and Discovery Access for Ghislaine Maxwell and Justin Rivera 
We are in the process of finalizing our response to the Maxwell/Rivera issue. We intend to 
explain that the discovery and counsel access accommodations that have been provided to Maxwell 
and Rivera, respectively, result from the specific circumstances of their cases, the specific requests 
of their lawyers, and their individual housing circumstances. On all of these factors, there are 
several important differences, including: 
The Maxwell case has multiple times more discovery than the Rivera case. Hence, the need 
for such expanded discovery access is greater in the Maxwell case. 
At the MDC, Maxwell has a unique housing situation, as she is in protective custody outside 
the general population. She therefore has sole access to a room to use a computer and phone 
for approximately 13 hours a day. Rivera, by contrast, is housed in the general population. 
There are approximately 8o other inmates at the MCC in Rivera's unit that use the same 
VTC room for court appearances, probation interviews, and attorney meetings. By contrast, 
Maxwell shares access to the MDC VTC room with substantially fewer inmates. The MDC 
can therefore provide 15 hours of VTC meetings with her attorneys without compromising 
access for other MDC inmates. The same is not true for Rivera at the MCC. 
Going forward, even though Rivera's counsel have asked (and the Court has ordered) that Rivera 
receive three hours of laptop access each day, the MCC is now leaving the laptop with him all day 
long, and only takes it back at night to charge it. Therefore, the MCC is now providing the same 
amount of electronic discovery access to Rivera that Maxwell receives at the MDC. 
As for providing Rivera with up to 15 hours of VTC access, we will explain that doing so will 
compromise access for other inmates. If defense counsel expresses a need for additional time, the 
MCC will continue to find ways to accommodate those requests as best as they can. 
Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss this further.

Can you keep me posted on what we think will be the substance of the draft declaration when you 
know (that is, before we are submitting anything on 12/31)? And how much of this is attributable to differences 
between MCC and MDC, as well as specific differences in their housing situations?

I wanted to bring to your attention a recent issue that's surfaced in United States v. Rivera et al., a 
sex trafficking case pending before Judge Engelmayer. As I'll describe in more detail below, Judge 
Engelmayer has asked us to submit a declaration from the BOP explaining why the discovery and 
counsel access accommodations provided to Ghislaine Maxwell (detained at the MDC outside the 
general population) cannot be extended to Justin Rivera (detained at the MCC in the general 
population). 
Justin Rivera was charged in February 2019 with sex trafficking conspiracy. He's been detained at 
the MCC since April 2019 on consent (he's also serving a state sentence). His trial, which was 
originally scheduled for April 2019, is expected to start on February 16, 2020. In July 2020, he had 
new counsel appointed, citing an irreconcilable breakdown with his former counsel. 
Since this fall, Judge Engelmayer has become increasingly frustrated with the MCC's treatment of 
Rivera. In particular, he's cited their failure to provide Rivera with adequate accommodations to 
review discovery and meet with his lawyers, who refuse to visit Rivera at the MCC for personal 
health concerns. We have two court orders in place to address these issues: (1) a laptop order, 
which requires the MCC to provide Rivera access to a laptop for three hours per day; and (2) a 
videoconference order, which requires the MCC to make available four hours of videoconferencing 
each week, in addition to any telephone or videoconference calls obtained through the Federal 
Defenders. 
At the moment, there's not a concern, at least from Judge Engelmayer, that the amount of time 
Rivera has for videoconferences and electronic discovery review is insufficient for trial preparation, 
although defense counsel has stated that they may request more time in the future. However, in a 
letter last night and during a court conference this morning (transcript attached), defense counsel 
cited the accommodations that the MDC has provided to Maxwell, describing them as "strikingly 
different and far superior" to those afforded to Rivera. Defense counsel further suggested that 
Rivera was being treated differently on account of his race, gender and class. Judge Engelmayer 
stated that the disparity in access "jumped off the page" and that the optics were "terrible," and 
asked us to explain the rationale for the differing treatment. After conferring with 
and 
EFTA00015905
--- PAGE 5 ---
before our conference, we explained our understanding that the disparity comes 
down to the fact that Maxwell and Rivera have very different housing situations, with Maxwell's 
situation being more amenable to greater access to electronic discovery review and legal visits. 
Judge Engelmayer asked us to submit a declaration, from an appropriate person at the BOP, 
explaining in more detail why the accommodations provided to Maxwell cannot be extended to 
Rivera. Based on the recent bail opposition in the Maxwell case, I believe the differences in 
counsel/discovery access are as follows: 
Accommodation 
Maxwell 
Rivera 
Review of electronic 
discovery (NB: each 
defendant has laptop access) 
hours per day/7 days per 
week (91 hours total) 
hours per day/7 days per 
week (21 hours total) 
Counsel visits (by video) 
hours per day/5 days per 
week (15 hours total) 
Four hours per week (plus an 
additional two hours 
scheduled through the 
Federal Defenders) (6 hours 
total) 
Weekend legal calls 
As needed 
Not available 
The declaration is due by December 31. Because Judge Engelmayer's request implicates at least two 
criminal cases, and potentially the ongoing civil litigation with the MCC, we wanted to make sure 
that you were all aware of this issue. We are also ha y to set up a call to discuss this further. In 
the meantime, we are working with 
to identify the appropriate declarant and 
draft an explanation for the Court.

Good evening, 
We hope you and your family had a joyful holiday. 
In response to your 12/14 email, we are requesting that Ms. Maxwell be permitted to use the laptop, 
in lieu of the MDC computer„ during the typicaL length of time other inmates are permitted out of 
their cells (our understanding is 6 am - 9:30 pm daily, extended to 10:30 pm on weekends.) 
The voluminous discovery is easier to access and review on the laptop. The MDC computer turns 
off every two hours and is not capable of opening all documents, and volume of discovery may be too 
taxing for the operating system. 
We also want to bring to your attention some of the ongoing issues concerning Ms. Maxwell's 
conditions and restrictions. 
The constant rotation of security staff results in inconsistency of rules and restrictions, the current 
shift being unnecessarily restrictive, punitive, and threatening. 
Ms. Maxwell is ordered to remain in specific locations within her isolation cell 
to accommodate capture on the handheld camera, restricting her use of an already small 
confinement area. 
Her use of the laptop has been restricted. 
She is invasively surveilled while showering. 
Her cell is cold and precipitation accumulates on the concrete block walls. 
Over the holiday weekend, a third blanket, used by Ms. Maxwell to keep herself warm, was removed 
leaving her cold; and she now has the onset of a cold. 
The blanket was returned the next day, after complaint was made by counsel. 
The open-mouth, wanding, pat-down, and in-and-behind ear searches continue, 
with more frequently than other inmates are searched. 
Her cell and legal papers are searched multiple times a day, a disruption to the organization of her 
legal work and an invasion into her privileged work product. 
She has not received daily newspapers for almost 3 weeks, and has not received certified mail 
(return receipts indicating delivery to MDC on 12/17) and non-certified mail for more than a week. 
We will keep you apprised of our concerns. 
Your assistance is appreciated. 
Best-

MDC Legal continues to provide inaccurate information. 
Contrary to the information provided to you as recited in your email of 12/29-
"MDC legal counsel confirmed that no staff member has ever directed 
Ms. Maxwell to remain in a particular location within her isolation cell. 
They confirmed that staff understand that no such directions should be given." 
last evening (12/29), Ms. Maxwell was instructed by guards not to stand 
on either corner of her isolation cell, not to stand to the left or right of the toilet and sink, 
and not to stand within 2.5 feet of the door to the cell. 
She was told that if she did not comply with this directive,  she would receive a disciplinary sanction. 
In addition, she is not receiving food designated on the menu. 
Further, the discovery disc provided does not work on the MDC computer; and the computer 
reports multiple errors indicating it cannot accommodate disc. 
Consequently, a replacement disc and/or replacement computer is required. 
Please let us know of the status of hard drive containing complete production; 
its immediate production could eliminate the disc issue. 
Your assistance is appreciated.

three days next week for meetings and interviews in West Palm Beach, Florida. As of now we tentatively expect to fly

Unfortunately we're still trying to pin down timing for interviewing the victims, so depending on the timing it will either 
be me and

Wanted to follow up on our phone conversation from about six weeks ago — I think we had anticipated that the electronic 
evidence that was being processed by CART from the New York residence search (which I believe was whittled down to 
approximately 5-6 iMacs and 5 laptop computers) would be completed for upload with load files for Relativity sometime 
in late October. We're concerned about timing particularly because I think that's just the tip of the iceberg — I don't think 
FBI has even started on the island materials, for example — so wanted to check on timing. Could you please let us know 
what the status is of those materials, and also what the materials are from the island that need to be processed, and 
whether there's an estimated time of completion for those as well?

• 
List of Payees of LSJE, LLC Account: Supplemental Exhibit B provides 
background information on the recipients of payments from an Epstein-
controlled account, LSJE, LLC. KYC records indicate that Epstein planned 
to use the LSJE account as a "[c]hecking account for the daily expenses

trust documents in the course of its due diligence on a separate Epstein-
settled trust, "The 2017 Caterpillar Trust." The Bank previously briefed the 
SDNY on payments to the majority of the beneficiaries of the 2013 
Butterfl Trust, with the exce tions being

Of course, absolutely, and thanks. I think whatever you feel would be appropriate, and certainly no problem in thanking

Hello, 
I've debated whether to send this email a thousand times. In fact, I've written it numerous times. Hopefully I 
will be brave enough to send it this time. 
My name is 
I was sexually assaulted when I was barely 18 years old in a NYC 
restaurant / club. At the time, I was too scared and confused and... well traumatized to do anything about it. My 
life pretty much crumbled after that. And by the time I pulled myself together, it was too late to do anything 
about it... Or at least I felt it was. I had done such a good job, eradicating anything associated with that part of 
my life and scrubbing my mind of the memories that I no longer remembered the details like the name of the girl 
that invited me along and introduced me to the person who assaulted me as well as the name or location of the 
venue. So I did nothing... 
A few months ago, I saw Epstein's face on the news and I put everything altogether... I was sexually assaulted by 
Jeffery Epstein. 
He's dead now... so I'm not really sure why I'm emailing or even bringing it up now but I just felt like I should let 
someone know. If I can be of help in anyway, I'd like to be. However, I don't really have proof and I can't really 
offer anything as far as Maxwell's case goes. She could have been there as well as I do remember there being a 
"woman" there along with numerous other "girls". I remember making a mental note to myself how it was weird 
that there that I was probably the oldest one out of the girls that were there except for the one woman that was 
sitting with the other men. 
Anyway, for now, I'd prefer to talk via email but if it makes sense, I'd be okay chatting with you in the future if 
you think it makes sense. Again, I'm not sure if I can be of any help or if it even makes sense to reach out 
anymore... but I just felt like I'd never forgive myself if I stayed silent again this time.

We just were contacted by defense counsel, who said they didn't have a call with their client this morning — I think they 
expected that the morning calls up until her arraignment on Tuesday would include the weekend. Is it possible to 
reinstitute the call for tomorrow at 10:00, as well as on Monday? Thanks very much, and sorry for the late notice — we

you know if that has gone through in the past five or ten minutes? They are looking to speak with her before her

You're welcome. We will do our best to provide a call at 10:00 AM every day this week to Mr. Everdell at the 
number he has previously provided. We will also provide a call on Monday 7/13/20. 
The EDNY and SDNY created a joint protocol whereby counsel may request legal calls to be placed in the 
afternoon at the MDC. Requests should be sent to 
Truly urgent requests can be sent to me, but unless there is a last minute, imminent court deadline, counsel 
really should send the requests to the federal defenders, as outlined in the protocol. We want to ensure inmates 
get equitable access. If they anticipate needing several calls in a week, they should make requests in advance 
and note whether and when calls would be preferred. Generally, calls are for 30 minutes in duration. If a 
longer call is desired, that should be explained as well. 
If you need anything else, please let me know.

Thank you so much, =. 
A 10am standing legal call every day before the arraignment on Tuesday 7/14 would be perfect if that's something you 
would be able to accommodate. Defense counsel will be available at that time, and they are very grateful for the 
time. 
We have also conveyed to defense counsel that they will need to follow the same protocols as other inmates' counsel 
following the arraignment. Thank you for letting us know about the lack of requests from defense counsel thus far. 
There appears to be some confusion on their end about how to submit requests to schedule legal calls. Would you be 
able to please share with us the procedure that they should follow, so that we can make sure they understand what 
steps to take going forward? 
Thank you again for all of your help—we really appreciate it.

You're welcome. 
Would 10 am work as a standing legal call through the end of this week (and Monday, if you think that's a good idea), in 
advance of the arraignment on Tuesday? However, after this, defense counsel should be required to follow the same 
protocols as all other inmates' counsel with respect to requesting legal calls. 
I also just want to make clear that defense counsel sent no requests yesterday that I am aware of, and we were able to 
facilitate a call yesterday evening following a request from your office, and today, I received one request, about mid-day, 
that we were again able to accommodate. So, I do not think it is fair at all to categorize this as defense counsel having 
difficulty scheduling legal calls. 
Thank you,

Thanks, 
This is about the legal call today. In addition, because defense counsel his having difficulty scheduling 
legal calls, it would be helpful if MDC could schedule standing calls for the rest of this week to address this issue.

Hi
Hope you're doing well. This evening, Judge Nathan directed the parties in the US v. Ghislaine Maxwell case to file a 
letter by 9pm today. Defense counsel need to speak with Ms. Maxwell this evening about the letter, but they have 
not been able to reach her. Would it be possible to allow Ms. Maxwell to make a legal call to her lawyers this 
evening, please? 
Thank you very much for your help.

On a separate subject, is it correct that, for security reasons, the defendant is being housed in her own cell 
(without a cellmate), and that her exercise time is separate from other inmates? That is our current understanding, but we 
wanted to confirm, and also to make sure the BOP would not have an issue if we referenced this in public filings.

Apologies all, I just saw these emails. We are not providing weekend calls generally at this time, and counsel has been having 
hour legal calls every afternoon in addition to the standing call set up in the morning. This is far more than almost every

only one call to counsel and one call to pretrial services. 
I have received no calls or emails from counsel, so I'm not sure where they have made these emergency requests. 
They will have another call with her tomorrow, and I can let staff know they will request the call on Tuesday as well.

Following up, we heard from defense counsel that they didn't receive a call this morning either and that they filed an

A 10am standing legal call every day before the arraignment on Tuesday 7/14 would be perfect if that's something 
you would be able to accommodate. Defense counsel will be available at that time, and they are very grateful for 
the time. 
We have also conveyed to defense counsel that they will need to follow the same protocols as other inmates' 
counsel following the arraignment. Thank you for letting us know about the lack of requests from defense counsel 
thus far. There appears to be some confusion on their end about how to submit requests to schedule legal calls. 
Would you be able to please share with us the procedure that they should follow, so that we can make sure they

You're welcome. 
Would 10 am work as a standing legal call through the end of this week (and Monday, if you think that's a good idea), 
in advance of the arraignment on Tuesday? However, after this, defense counsel should be required to follow the same 
protocols as all other inmates' counsel with respect to requesting legal calls. 
I also just want to make clear that defense counsel sent no requests yesterday that I am aware of, and we were able to 
facilitate a call yesterday evening following a request from your office, and today, I received one request, about mid-
day, that we were again able to accommodate. So, I do not think it is fair at all to categorize this as defense counsel 
having difficulty scheduling legal calls.

now wants to cooperate with authorities on the Maxwell case. I believe he is credible. 
He named many names to me which we didn't publish but he is happy to share with investigators.

Laura Menninger tried sending the below message to you earlier this evening on behalf of defense counsel, but it seems 
that it has not been delivered yet due to technical problems. I am forwarding it on to you myself. Please confirm receipt. 
Thanks, 
Chris 
Counsel: 
Attached please find our proposed Protective Order, with a redline and a clean copy. 
As a prefatory note, it is equally in our client's interest as much as in yours to have this matter tried before a jury of 
impartial peers. We have no desire to try this case in the press. Unfortunately, however, some of your prospective 
witnesses and their counsel have repeatedly and persistently violated Local Rule 23.1 and ethics standards pertaining to 
pretrial publicity. Defense witnesses should be afforded the same protections from harassment and intimidation as are 
government witnesses. Government witnesses should be on the same footing as both the Defendant and defense 
witnesses in terms of access to and use of discovery. 
Regarding public filings, because each document filed in this case redacted or under seal will be subject to a press request 
to unseal it, we need to ensure at the outset that we only mark things as confidential that the Court (and Second Circuit) 
will view as such when making an unsealing determination, so we included a definition of "Confidential" consistent with 
the case law. See, e.g., Brown v. Maxwell. 
A few notes to explain specific changes. 
1. We have clarified treatment of non-confidential discovery materials from confidential discovery materials. We 
have modified the access restrictions for non-confidential materials because we did not believe them necessary or 
appropriate. 
EFTA00015968
--- PAGE 2 ---
2. We have fine-tuned the definition of what constitutes "Confidential" consistent with prior decisions in the Second 
Circuit and common law privacy rights of individuals. This language has been adopted by magistrates in this Circuit 
for civil cases. 
3. We have removed the category of "Highly Confidential." If there is a category of documents that think warrants 
separate treatment, we should discuss what types of evidence you believe should fall into such category or and 
why they merit separate treatment from "confidential information." We cannot imagine, for example, that 
discovery contains child pornography, which counsel will not possess in any event. 
4. With respect to our client's access to the Discovery and Confidential information, your proposal would not allow 
any means for her to review any Confidential information because you required she review it in the presence of 
counsel and we are not allowed in-person visits with her. We propose that, consistent with numerous other federal 
pretrial detainees, the Government shall make available a laptop containing all of the Discovery (including any 
Confidential Information) for her to review while in custody. She would have regular access to the laptop

Yes, I highlighted the huge volume of discovery for Maxwell when I spoke with 
this morning. That volume was a 
significant driver in our team's decision to request that she receive so much time to review her discovery. Based on my 
read of the transcript from this morning's Rivera conference, it sounds like Rivera is not even using all the time he has 
now. By contrast, my understanding is that Maxwell is using up the full time she has been given.

I'd also look into potential differences in the volume of discovery. No idea what your case entails, MEI but in Maxwell 
we have produced truly enormous volumes of material (we seized 60 some devices during the investigation, for example, 
in addition to an entire FBI file from the prior Florida investigation...) that may explain some of this.

Thanks, 
Can you keep me posted on what we think will be the substance of the draft declaration when you know 
(that is, before we are submitting anything on 12/31)? And how much of this is attributable to differences between MCC 
and MDC, as well as specific differences in their housing situations?

Subject: Disparities in Counsel and Discovery Access for Ghislaine Maxwell and Justin Rivera 
All: 
I wanted to bring to your attention a recent issue that's surfaced in United States v. Rivera et al., a sex 
trafficking case pending before Judge Engelmayer. As I'll describe in more detail below, Judge 
Engelmayer has asked us to submit a declaration from the BOP explaining why the discovery and 
counsel access accommodations provided to Ghislaine Maxwell (detained at the MDC outside the 
general population) cannot be extended to Justin Rivera (detained at the MCC in the general 
population). 
Justin Rivera was charged in February 2019 with sex trafficking conspiracy. He's been detained at the 
MCC since April 2019 on consent (he's also serving a state sentence). His trial, which was originally 
scheduled for April 2019, is expected to start on February 16, 2020. In July 2020, he had new counsel 
appointed, citing an irreconcilable breakdown with his former counsel. 
Since this fall, Judge Engelmayer has become increasingly frustrated with the MCC's treatment of 
Rivera. In particular, he's cited their failure to provide Rivera with adequate accommodations to 
review discovery and meet with his lawyers, who refuse to visit Rivera at the MCC for personal health 
concerns. We have two court orders in place to address these issues: (0 a laptop order, which requires 
the MCC to provide Rivera access to a laptop for three hours per day; and (2) a videoconference order, 
which requires the MCC to make available four hours of videoconferencing each week, in addition to 
any telephone or videoconference calls obtained through the Federal Defenders. 
At the moment, there's not a concern, at least from Judge Engelmayer, that the amount of time Rivera 
has for videoconferences and electronic discovery review is insufficient for trial preparation, although 
defense counsel has stated that they may request more time in the future. However, in a letter last 
night and during a court conference this morning (transcript attached), defense counsel cited the 
accommodations that the MDC has provided to Maxwell, describing them as "strikingly different and 
far superior" to those afforded to Rivera. Defense counsel further suggested that Rivera was being 
treated differently on account of his race, gender and class. Judge Engelmayer stated that the 
disparity in arress "jumped off the page" and that the optics were "terrible," and asked us to explain
the rationale for the differing treatment. After conferring with 
and 
before 
our conference, we explained our understanding that the disparity comes down to the fact that 
Maxwell and Rivera have very different housing situations, with Maxwell's situation being more 
amenable to greater access to electronic discovery review and legal visits. 
Judge Engelmayer asked us to submit a declaration, from an appropriate person at the BOP, 
explaining in more detail why the accommodations provided to Maxwell cannot be extended to Rivera. 
Based on the recent bail opposition in the Maxwell case, I believe the differences in counsel/discovery 
access are as follows: 
Accommodation

Rivera

Review of electronic

Four hours per week (plus an 
additional two hours 
scheduled through the 
Federal Defenders) (6 hours

Not available 
The declaration is due by December 31. Because Judge Engelmayer's request implicates at least two 
criminal cases, and potentially the ongoing civil litigation with the MCC, we wanted to make sure that 
you were all aware of this issue.  We are also happy to set up a call to discuss this further. In the 
meantime, we are working with 
to identify the appropriate declarant and draft an 
explanation for the Court.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 
The only issue before the Court is whether conditions exist that can reasonably assure 
Ms. Maxwell's appearance during this case. On this renewed application, Ms. Maxwell has put 
before the Court a significant bail package, supported by detailed submissions, which warrant 
her release on strict conditions. She and her spouse have committed to signing a bond in the full 
amount of their net worth, regardless of the ownership of the underlying assets. She has 
proffered seven additional sureties, consisting of her family and close friends, many of whom are 
U.S. citizens and long-time residents, who have come forward at great personal risk and have 
pledged meaningful assets. The government does not challenge the good faith and bona fides of 
these proposed sureties. She has provided a detailed report from a respected accounting firm, 
which was further reviewed by a former IRS special agent, setting forth a statement of her 
financial condition, supported by voluminous documentation. The government does not 
challenge the report's findings, nor its underlying documentation. She has agreed, in writing, to 
give up any right she has or could have to contest extradition and submit to all other standard 
travel restrictions. And she has noted that a key representation made by the government at the 
initial bail hearing as to the strength of its evidence is simply not accurate --
and there is no "significant contemporaneous documentary 
evidence" that corroborates its case. 
With regard to any other defendant, this record would readily support release on strict 
bail conditions, perhaps even on consent. But this is Ghislaine Maxwell, the apparent substitute 
for Jeffrey Epstein. So, instead, in its response the government urges the Court to disregard the 
significant additional evidence proffered to the Court and further argues that a defendant cannot 
be eligible for bail (apparently on any conditions), unless she can provide an absolute guarantee 
against all risks. But this is not the legal standard. United States v. Orta, 760 F.2d 887, 888 n.4, 
EFTA00015981
--- PAGE 6 ---
892-93 (8th Cir. 1985) ("The legal standard required by the [Bail Reform] Act is one of reasonable 
assurances, not absolute guarantees."). Under, the Bail Reform Act, a defendant must be released 
unless there are "no conditions" that would reasonably assure her presence. Here, the proposed 
package satisfies the actual governing standard, and the Court should grant bail. 
ARGUMENT 
I. 
The Government Concedes that Its Case Relics Almost Exclusively on the 
Testimony of Three Witnesses 
in evaluating the strength of the government's case in its prior ruling, the Court relied on 
the government's proffer that the testimony of the three accusers would be corroborated by 
"significant contemporaneous documentary evidence." ('Tr. 82 (emphasis added)). The 
government now expressly retreats from this position. It is abundantly clear from the 
government's response that it has no "significant contemporaneous documentary evidence"—in 
fact, it has virtually no documentary corroboration at all—and that its case against Ms. Maxwell 
is based almost exclusively on the recollections of the three accusers, who remain unidentified, 
concerning events that took place over 25 years ago. Moreover, the government offers no 
specificity about when within the four-year period of the charged conspiracy the alleged 
incidents of abuse took place. This, alone, is grounds for the Court to reconsider its prior ruling. 
The few examples of documentary corroboration referenced by the government—which 
are the same examples that the government touted at the initial bail hearing—pertain to Epstein, 
not Ms. Maxwell. The government concedes that 
government further states that 
(Gov. Mem. at II (emphasis added)). The 
(Id. 
(emphasis added)). The strength of the government's case against Jeffrey Epstein is not at issue 
EFTA00015982
--- PAGE 7 ---
here. Whether or not the accusers' recollections as to Epstein are corroborated is irrelevant to 
the strength of the evidence against Ms. Maxwell. 
The only purported corroboration that pertains in any way to Ms. Maxwell is of marginal 
value. The government references 
■ 
(Id. at 11). But even the government concedes that, at best, 
It is clear that the only evidence that Ms. Maxwell allegedly "groomed" the accusers or 
knowingly facilitated or participated in Epstein's sexual abuse of minors will come solely from 
the testimony of the three accusers. The government's case against Ms. Maxwell therefore rests 
entirely on the credibility and reliability of these three witnesses.2 Moreover, the substantive 
counts (Counts Two and Four) are based on the testimony of only one witness, Minor Victim-1. 
It is also telling that the government does not even attempt to rebut the defense's assertion that it 
did not begin issuing subpoenas for documents related to Ms. Maxwell until just after the death 
of Jeffrey Epstein. This confirms that the case against Ms. Maxwell was assembled after the fact 
'The government also proffers that they will have "additional witnesses." (Gov. Mem at Ilk But these arc not 
"outcry" witnesses who will corroborate a contemporaneous account of abuse from one or more of the accusers. 
Instead, they will testify only that "both [Ms. Maxwell] and Epstein knew and interacted with certain minor victims 
when those victims were minors." (Id.). Again, the fact that Ms. Maxwell may have "met and interacted with" 
someone when they were a minor proves absolutely nothing. 
One of the witnesses has submitted a letter to the Court. While the CVRA permits the right to be heard, the letter 
should be given no legal weight in the Court's bail analysis. See United Stales v. Turner, 367 F. Supp. 2d 319, 331-
(E.D.N.Y. 2005) 
EFTA00015983
--- PAGE 8 ---
as a substitute for its prosecution of Epstein.; The government's case is not what it represented 
to the Court at the initial bail hearing, which should weigh heavily in favor of granting bail.4
II. 
The Government Has Not Carried Its Burden 
A. 
The Government Asks the Court to Ignore Ms. Maxwell's Substantial 
Ties to the United States, Including Her Spouse 
The government incorrectly argues that the renewed bail application offers no new 
information and that the Court was "already aware of the defendant's friends and family in 
the United States. (Gov. Mem. at 13). The government ignores that, since the initial bail 
hearing, Ms. Maxwell's spouse has come forward as a co-signor and has submitted a 
detailed letter describing his committed relationship with Ms. Maxwell for over four years 
and the important role she has played, and continues to play, 
It also ignores that several of Ms. Maxwell's closest friends and family, many of 
whom are U.S. citizens and residents, have also come forward, at considerable personal risk, 
to support her bond with pledges of assets or letters of support. This information, which 
was not available to the Court at the time of the initial hearing, demonstrates Ms. Maxwell's 
strong ties to this country and weighs heavily in favor of bail. 
Rather than address the merits, the government attempts to dismiss the significance 
of Ms. Maxwell's relationship with her spouse, noting that Ms. Maxwell told Pretrial 
Services that she was in the process of getting a divorce and that her spouse did not step 
forward as a co-signer at the initial bail hearing. (Id. at 13-14). The government is entirely 
Moreover. the government failure to request 
regardless of whether it was legally obligated to 
do so. shows that the government has accept 
e accusers accounts without serious scrutiny. Given the 
ovenunent's ongoittti Brady obligations. it is unsettling that the government would simply acce 
Contrary to the government's assertion_ the defense has not abandoned our legal challenges to the indictment. 
(Gov. Mem at 10 n.1). We believe we have strong arguments that have only gotten stronger with the production of 
discovery. We will be making those arguments to the Court in our pretrial motions to be filed next month. 
EFTA00015984
--- PAGE 9 ---
mistaken. Prior to her arrest, Ms. Maxwell and her spouse had discussed the idea of getting 
a divorce as an additional way to create distance between Ms. Maxwell and her spouse to 
protect him 
from the terrible consequences of being associated with her. 
Nevertheless, in the weeks following the initial bail hearing, 
She and her spouse therefore had no reason to continue 
discussing divorce, which neither of them wanted in the first place. Nor was there any 
reason for her spouse to refrain from stepping forward as a co-signer. In sum, the 
government has offered nothing but unsupported innuendo to suggest that Ms. Maxwell's 
relationship with her spouse 
is not a powerful tie to this country. 
The government's assertion that Ms. Maxwell must not have a close relationship 
with 
is particularly callous 
and belied by the facts. (Gov. Mem. at 14). As her spouse explains, 
(Ex. A ¶ 12). 
B. 
Ms. Maxwell Has Thoroughly Disclosed Her Finances and Pledged All of 
Her and Her Spouse's Assets in Support of Her Bond 
The government's attempts to rebut the financial condition report are unavailing. 
Significantly, the government does not contest the accuracy of the report, nor the 
voluminous supporting documentation. In fact, the government has proffered nothing that 
calls into question the report's detailed account of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse's assets for 
the last five years, which addresses one of the Court's principal reasons for denying bail. 
Rather than question the report itself, the government attempts to argue that Ms. 
Maxwell deceived the Court and Pretrial Services about her assets. (Gov. Mem. at 22-23). 
EFTA00015985
--- PAGE 10 ---
The report shows nothing of the son. Ms. Maxwell, who was sifting in a jail cell at the time, 
was asked by Pretrial Services to estimate her assets. Accordingly, she gave her best 
estimate of the assets she held in her own name, which the government concedes she did 
with remarkable accuracy considering that she had not reviewed her financial statements.5
The government's arguments further confirm that it has lost all objectivity and will 
view at any fact involving Ms. Maxwell in the worst possible light. For example, the 
government asserts that Ms. Maxwell has demonstrated "sophistication in hiding her assets" 
and characterizes her transfers to a trust as "funneling" assets to her spouse to "hide her true 
wealth." (Id. at 24). There is nothing unusual, let alone nefarious or even particularly 
sophisticated about transferring assets into a trust or a spouse. Indeed, Ms. Maxwell fully 
disclosed these transactions on her joint tax returns. More importantly, all of the assets 
disclosed in the financial report, whether they are owned by Ms. Maxwell or her spouse, are 
included in the bond amount and are subject to forfeiture if she flees. 
The government further argues that the financial condition report shows that Ms. 
Maxwell has access to millions of dollars of "unrestrained funds" that she could use to flee 
the country and reimburse any of her sureties for the loss of their security. (Id. at 23). That 
characterization is simply untrue. First, as disclosed in the financial report, Ms. Maxwell 
has procured significant loans on the basis of a negative pledge over her London property. 
Second, the $4 million controlled by her spouse 
could only be liquidated with considerable difficulty. 
The government also faults Ms. Maxwell for not including a valuation of future 
contingent assets and income that may never materialize. (Id. at 23-24). For example,■ 
$ Moreover, for the reasons discussed in our initial memorandum, Ms. Maxwell was reluctant to discuss anything 
about her spouse and clearly expressed her reluctance to Pretrial Services early on in the interview. 
EFTA00015986
--- PAGE 11 ---
Similarly, the financial report does not include 
a future income stream for Ms. Maxwell or her spouse because it presents only historical 
and current assets. Even so, Ms. Maxwell has no certain future income stream. Her spouse 
and has had to liquidate his existing investments to help Ms. Maxwell. Finally, the 
reference to 
is gratuitous. Ms. Maxwell had no knowledge of 
But the larger point is this: Ms. Maxwell has proposed a substantial bail package 
with multiple co-signers and significant security. She and her spouse have pledged all of 
their assets in support of the bond. Ms. Maxwell's wealth is not a reason to deny her bail. It 
is a reason to set appropriately strict conditions that will result in significant financial 
consequences to Ms. Maxwell and her friends and family if she leaves the country. The 
proposed bail package does exactly that .° 
C. 
The Government's Assertion that Ms. Maxwell Is "Adept" at Hiding and 
Therefore a Flight Risk Is Specious 
The government continues to assert the sinister narrative that Ms. Maxwell had "an 
expertise at remaining hidden," and that it would therefore be easy for her to become a fugitive. 
` The government's argument that her spouse's moral suasion is diminished because Ms. Maxwell brought the 
majority of assets to the relationship is nonsensical. (Id. at 24-25). Regardless of whose mono it was to begin with, 
all of the assets of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse will be forfeited if she flees and her spouse 
will be 
left with nothing. Furthermore, the government's assertion that they could not verify the spouse s inancia 
information because Ms. Maxwell did not provide his current banking information is false. (Id. at 24 n.9). The 
defense provided the spouse's current banking records and only redacted the name of the bank. 
EFTA00015987
--- PAGE 12 ---
(Gov. Mem. at 20). The government suggests that purchasing a home using a trust and providing 
a pseudonym to a real estate broker are indicative of her willingness and ability to live in hiding 
and somehow forecast Ms. Maxwell's intention to flee. (Id.). These arguments are just further 
evidence that the government will frame every fact about Ms. Maxwell in the worst possible 
light. As the defense has already argued extensively in its initial brief, these steps were borne 
out of necessity to protect Ms. Maxwell and her family from harassment and physical threats. 
Moreover, they are not predictive of flight. There is simply no basis to conclude, based on the 
measures that Ms. Maxwell was forced to take to protect herself and her family, that she would 
then willingly abandon that family to become a fugitive from justice. To the contrary, she 
remained in the country precisely to remain close to them and to defend her case. 
D. 
Refusal of Extradition from France or the United Kingdom Is Highly 
Unlikely 
The government dismisses Ms. Maxwell's willingness to waive her extradition rights as 
to France and the United Kingdom as "meaningless" because Ms. Maxwell cannot guarantee 
with absolute certainty that either country will enforce the waiver. (Gov. Mem. at 14). The 
government misses the point: Ms. Maxwell's willingness to do everything she can to eliminate 
her ability to refuse extradition to the fullest extent possible demonstrates her firm commitment 
to remain in this country to face the charges against her and, as Ms. Maxwell's French and U.K. 
experts confirm, there is every reason to believe that both authorities would consider the waiver 
as part of any extradition request. 
In an attempt to counter William Julie's expert report stating it is "highly unlikely" that 
the French government would refuse to extradite Ms. Maxwell (Def. Mem., Ex. V at 2), the 
government attaches a letter from the French Ministry of Justice ("MOP') that references neither 
Mr. Julie's report nor Ms. Maxwell, but states generally that the French Code of Criminal 
Procedure "absolutely prohibits" the extradition of a French national. (Gov. Mem., Ex. B). But 
EFTA00015988
--- PAGE 13 ---
as Mr. Julie's accompanying rebuttal report explains (see Ex. A), the MOJ letter ignores that the 
extradition provisions in French Code of Criminal Procedure apply only in the absence of an 
international agreement providing otherwise. (Id. at 1). This rule is necessitated by the French 
Constitution, which requires that international agreements prevail over national legislation. (Id.). 
Thus, extradition of a French national to the United States is legally permissible if the extradition 
treaty between the United States and France provides for it—which it does. (Id. at 3). 
The government's reliance on a 2006 case—in which France refused to extradite a 
French national who was also a U.S. citizen—provides no precedent as to how a French court 
would rule on an extradition request regarding Ms. Maxwell because, as Mr. Julie notes, the 
United States did not challenge the refusal in the French courts. (/d. at 2-3). Nor does it 
undermine Mr. Julia's opinion that, in the unusual circumstance where a citizen of both countries 
has executed an extradition waiver and then fled to France in violation of bail conditions set by a 
U.S. court, it is "highly unlikely" that an extradition decree would not be issued. (/d. at 3). 
The government offers no rebuttal to the opinion of Ms. Maxwell's U.K. extradition 
expert, David Perry. Nor does it dispute Mr. Perry's opinion that Ms. Maxwell would be "highly 
unlikely" to successfully resist extradition from the United Kingdom, that her waiver would be 
admissible in any extradition proceeding, and that—contrary to the government's representation 
at the initial bail hearing (Tr. 27)—bail would be "extremely unlikely." (See Def. Mem. Ex. U at 
¶ 39). Mr. Perry's addendum opinion (attached as Ex. B) reiterates these points, opining that the 
waiver would be "a highly relevant factor" in the U.K. proceeding, both to the likelihood of 
extradition and to the likelihood of bail while the proceeding is pending. (Id. ¶ 3).7
Nor, as the government suggests, does the Secretary of State have general "discretion to deny extradition" after a 
court has entered a final extradition order. (See Gov. Mem. at 19). That discretion is limited to a handful of 
exceptional circumstances that would likely be inapplicable to Ms. Maxwell's case. (Id. ¶¶ 4-5). 
EFTA00015989
--- PAGE 14 ---
Finally, the government's argument that Ms. Maxwell could always flee to some country 
other than the United Kingdom and France holds her—and any defendant—to an impossible 
standard, which is not the standard under the Bail Reform Act. (See Gov. Mem. at 19). By the 
government's reasoning, no defendant with financial means to travel could be granted bail, 
because there would always be a possibility that they could flee to another country (even if they 
had no ties there), and there could never be an assurance that any extradition waiver would be 
enforced. However, "Section 3142 does not seek ironclad guarantees." United States v. Chen, 
820 F. Supp. 1205, 1208 (N.D. Cal. 1992). To the extent that Ms. Maxwell's ties to France and 
the United Kingdom—where she has not lived for nearly 30 years—create a flight risk, her 
extradition waivers along with the substantial bail package proposed reasonably cure it.8
E. 
The Recent COVID Surge at MDC Further Justifies Bail 
The government suggests that the Court ignore COVID concerns because Ms. Maxwell, 
though quarantined because of contact with an officer who tested positive, did not become 
infected. This ignores the daily (sometimes multiple) inspections of Ms. Maxwell's mouth, 
which heightens her risk of contracting the deadly virus, which has now surged to 113 positive 
cases in the MDC. Further, Deputy Captain B. Houtz recently issued a memo stating that "(ijt 
has not been determined whether legal calls and legal visits will continue." As the Court is well 
aware, legal visits with Ms. Maxwell already have been suspended. Should legal calls also be 
discontinued, her constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel will be further eroded. 
CONCLUSION 
For the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that the Court order her 
release on bail pursuant to the strict conditions she has proposed. 
Any incentive Ms. Maxwell might have to flee to France has been greatly diminished by the recent arrest in France 
of Jean-Luc Brunel. who reportedly is under investigation for alleged sexual assaults by Jeffrey Epstein. See. e.g..

I am a very close friend of Ms.

of Calderitas, Mexico. Ms. 
was abused by 
Jeffrey Epstein on numerous occasions at his townhome in New 
York and his caribbean island home in the Virgin Islands. They 
both have expressed their interest in asking me to register her claim 
as a victim in any case involving Mr. Epstein's estate, which she 
believes she may have a claim. 
She does not have legal representation yet, but is in negotiations to 
retain and attorney soon.

Re: 
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (A.JN) 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
motion for bail. 
submits the following statement in opposition to the Defendant's renewed 
*** 
I appreciate the opportunity to again be heard by the Court in this matter and once more 
request that Ghislaine Maxwell not be released prior to her trial. I write this not only on behalf of 
myself, but all of the other girls and young women who were victimized by Maxwell. Ghislaine 
Maxwell sexually abused me as a child and the government has the responsibility to make sure 
that she stands trial for her crimes. I do not believe that will happen or that any of the women she 
exploited will see justice if she is released on bail. She has lived a life of privilege, abusing her 
position of power to live beyond the rules. Fleeing the country in order to escape once more would 
fit with her long history of anti-social behavior. 
Drawing on my personal experience with Maxwell and what I have learned of how she has 
lived since that time, I believe that she is a psychopath. Her abuse of me and many other children 
and young women is evidence of her disregard for and violation of the rights of others. She has 
demonstrated a complete failure to accept to responsibility in any way for her actions and 
demonstrated a complete lack of remorse for her central role in procuring girls for Epstein to abuse. 
She was both charming and manipulative with me during the grooming process, consistent with 
what many of the women she abused have described. She has frequently lied to others, including 
repeatedly lying about me and my family. Maxwell has for decades lived a parasitic lifestyle 
relying on Epstein and others to fund her lavish existence. 
Maxwell has repeatedly demonstrated that her primary concern is her own welfare, and 
that she is willing to harm others if it benefits her. She is quite capable of doing so once more. She 
will not hesitate to leave the country irrespective of whether others will be on the hook financially 
for her actions because she lacks empathy, and therefore simply does not care about hurting others. 
She would in fact be highly motivated to flee in order to reduce the possibility of continued 
imprisonment, the conditions of which she has continuously complained. Her actions over the last 
several years and choice to live in isolation for long periods suggest that being comfortable is more

important to her than being connected. Even more concerning, is if she is let out she has the ability 
to once again abuse children and the painful consequences of that type of trauma can last a lifetime. 
I implore the Court to make sure that Ghislaine Maxwell does not escape justice by keeping her 
incarcerated until her trial.

Here is the feedback from the Crown Prosecution Service. As noted, a consent in the US would not be binding 
on a court in the UK. (I can pull the relevant Extradition Act provisions cited below) While I suggested in our 
call this is like the kind of colloquy necessary for a guilty plea, I am reminded that consent to extradited is 
irrevocable and not appealable — no so with a plea. 
I will try to write something up today, but my DOJ computer has been acting up.

Subject: RE: Extradition question 
Dear all 
The standard principle is that extradition should be sought only where it is necessary and proportionate to do so. If a RP 
indicated a willingness to fully abide by conditions of bail etc then it would be a matter for the US authorities as to 
whether to accept those terms. If the RP returned to the UK but then reneged on the deal, then the failure to comply 
with such undertakings would inevitably lead to a Request for extradition and would be a factor on whether the person 
is detained on bail or in custody. If the RP was to offer a consent, the Judge in court would need to satisfy himself that 
the RP had received appropriate legal advice ( because it is irrevocable and there is no ground of appeal. The SSHD 
would then have 2 months to arrange the surrender. The only consent that matters is the one before the extradition 
judge in the UK and it will usually be determined at the initial hearing but can be offered at any time before the 
extradition hearing has concluded. There is no caselaw on this to my mind but the relevant statutory provisions are s 72 
(7)(b) and 72(8) for full order, s74 (7)(b) and s74 (8) for provisional arrest and s127 and s128 on consent- irrevocable 
point/legal advice and sending of case to SSHD. 
Hope this helps!

Dear 
Thanks for your email. 
Anne-Marie Kundert 
I think the difficulty here is as you mention — the consent given to the US authorities would not be binding on the RP in 
the UK or on the UK court. Consent to extradition must be given irrevocably in writing to the UK court under s72 (8) 
Extradition Act 2003. In other words what the RP is offering in the US is a promise to consent before the UK court, which 
is unenforceable. 
I hope that assists — I don't have a case to hand. Anne-Marie returns tomorrow and may be able to add.

Subject: Extradition question 
Dear Anne-Marie - I hope you are well. It has been too long since we have talked! 
I have a UK extradition question which has been raised by a UK citz facing a US crime and currently 
being detained in the US. The defendant is seeking bail in the US and wants to execute a 
prophylactic "consent to be extradited" from the UK as proof that he is not a flight risk. 
EFTA00016029
--- PAGE 5 ---
My understanding of UK law is that even if a defendant consents to be extradited, a UK judge still 
has to independently be satisfied that the extradition comports with UK law. So, for instance, if the 
defendant is released, flees to the UK, and then faces UK extradition, that consent may be evidence, 
but a UK judge would still have to decide on all factors potentially applicable at the time of the 
extradition. (The defendant may also claim that his prophylactic consent was coerced by his 
condition in the US.) Do I have that right? Is there a case or two which I can cite which stands for 
that proposition? 
Many thanks!

Hi 
- the severed half of Carl Andrews's case is scheduled for trial in mid-February, and lawyers for one of the 
defendants in that coming trial have just filed a letter (attached) arguing their client, Justin Rivera, is receiving insufficient 
access to discovery at MCC when compared to the access to discovery Maxwell is getting at MDC (see page 4). 
Do you have a few minutes to chat before tomorrow at 10:30am (when we next appear before PAE) regarding Maxwell's 
access? I'm aware of the obvious differences in institutions (MDC is larger and has more space than MCC) and particular 
units (the women's unit at MDC being viewed as particularly spacious with its own library, I think) -- and how these 
differences probably allow for Maxwell to have substantially more access than a male inmate at MCC.

The Honorable Paul A. Engelmayer 
United States District Court Judge 
Southern District of New York 
500 Pearl Street 
New York, New York 10007 
Re: United States v. Justin Rivera; 19 Cr. 131 (PAE) 
Dear Judge Engelmayer: 
We write in advance of tomorrow's conference to further update the Court 
regarding Justin Rivera's access to discovery at the Metropolitan Correctional Center 
("MCC") and his access to counsel. 
i. 
Mr. Rivera's Access to His Laptop 
As we previously indicated, Mr. Rivera received his laptop on Tuesday, 
December 8, 2020, while in the Special Housing Unit ("SHU"). In the SHU, he was 
given his laptop each day for a minimum of 3 hours, in his cell, which he shared with 
another inmate. On Friday, December II, 2020, Mr. Rivera was transferred to a unit. 
There, he requested access to the laptop and was informed by staff that they were 
unaware of Your Honor's Order. As such, Mr. Rivera was denied access to his laptop 
from December 11, 2020 until December 14, 2020. 
In response to MCC's non-compliance, Your Honor ordered that general counsel, 
Nicole McFarland file a daily letter with the Court regarding Mr. Rivera's access to his 
laptop. Upon review of such letters, it is correct that Mr. Rivera did not agree to go to the 
law library to review discovery on his laptop on December 
17'h and 18'h. He did not 
do so because of increasing health and safety and privacy concerns, which he expressed 
to staff throughout the week. 
On Monday, December 14, 2020, following the conference, he was told for the 
first time that he would not have access to the laptop in his cell, but rather in the law 
library. He was given odd looks from staff, who conveyed their disagreement with Mr. 
Rivera. One staff member told him he was "enemy #1" and that staff are "on" him 
EFTA00016118
--- PAGE 2 ---
because he was provided a laptop and increased video calls. 
Unsettled by these 
comments and growing increasingly uncomfortable, he asked to leave the law library 
after about an hour and a half. He was also uncomfortable with having to be transported 
throughout the prison and having increased contact with staff and civilians outside of his 
unit because of the recent COVID-19 outbreak, which he also expressed repeatedly, 
including most recently in a memo on Friday, December 18, 2020. 
In our discussions with the Government last week, we repeatedly requested that 
Mr. Rivera be able to review discovery on his laptop inside his cell for at least 3 hours 
per day, seven days per week. There, he can review discovery privately and in a safe 
manner. Despite permitting him to access his laptop in his cell while in the SHU, the 
MCC, without clear reason, refused to allow him to do so while on his unit. To create 
further confusion, the MCC, late in the week, decided to allow him access to his laptop in 
his cell on weekends, beginning on Friday afternoons and concluding Monday mornings, 
and holidays. 
Accordingly, any security reason cannot be the basis for MCC's 
disallowance of Mr. Rivera accessing his laptop on weekdays. Rather, such disallowance 
seems specifically targeted at Mr. Rivera. 
We are deeply concerned by staff's reference to Mr. Rivera as "enemy #1" and 
that they are "on" him. Such comments make clear that Mr. Rivera is at risk of harm 
from staff. 
Further, they intensify the daily stress he is under. 
He is presently 
experiencing harsh conditions of confinement, with limited access to counsel and little 
communication with his family. We are also concerned with the present COVID-19 
outbreak at the MCC and MCC's handling of it. Moving Mr. Rivera throughout the 
prison currently is unsafe. 
We ask that the Court order that Mr. Rivera be given his laptop each weekday and 
on weekends while in his cell. We are uncertain as to measures this Court can take to 
promote Mr. Rivera's safety from staff other than to convey the message loud and clear 
to the MCC, which the Court has done in the past, that such conduct is inappropriate and 
unacceptable. 
it 
Mr. Rivera's Access to Counsel and Need for at Least 2 Two-Hour 
Additional Video Calls Per Week 
Prior to our conference on December 14, 2020, by letter dated December 13, 
2020, we specifically requested that the Court order increased video calls, specifically, 
two 2-hour video calls per week (in addition to our existing weekly one I-hour phone call 
and one 1-hour video call) as we are unable to meet with Mr. Rivera in person until the 
week of January 18'11, 2021, per Chief Judge McMahon's December I" Standing Order. 
Attached to our letter was a letter from Deirdre D. von Domum, Attorney-in-Charge, at 
the Federal Defenders of New York. Ms. von Domum explained that Federal Defenders 
is only responsible for scheduling and that the MCC permits only 35 hours each week of 
video calls. Further, Federal Defenders, because of increasing demand, has repeatedly 
requested that more video and phone call time be provided by the MCC. The MCC, 
despite the ability to do so, denied these requests citing staffing issues as the reason for 
EFTA00016119
--- PAGE 3 ---
the inability to provide more hours. 
The Court directed the parties to submit a joint proposed order for MCC to 
provide Mr. Rivera with 2 two-hour video conferences with counsel per week.' It is 
defense counsel's understanding that the Court specifically ordered that Mr. Rivera be 
provided with 2 two-hour slots. The Court also advised that we should include language 
regarding the fact that Mr. Rivera's trial is scheduled to begin on February 16, 2020, and 
that his current counsel was appointed recently, during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Following the conference, we drafted a proposed order and shared it with the 
Government. After a discussion between the Government and MCC, we were informed 
by the Government that the MCC refused to accommodate our request of two 2-hour 
video calls. Instead, we were told that the MCC was only going to provide one 4-hour 
session. Further, per an email from Ms. McFarland, we were told the schedule of such 
sessions: Friday, December 18, 2020, from 5:45 p.m. to 9:45 p.m.', Wednesday, 
December 23, 2020, from 5:45 p.m. to 9:45 p.m. and December 31, 2020, from 5:45 p.m. 
to 9:45 p.m., and each Friday in 2021 from 5:45 p.m. to 9:45 p.m. We immediately 
contacted the Government and made repeated requests for two 2-hour video calls. We 
explained to the Government that meetings in shorter blocks of time are far more 
effective because of the diminishing returns in longer meetings. Further, shorter meetings 
on more days gives us time to digest the material we learn, review additional records and 
discovery which is still being produced by the Government and ensure continuous and 
ongoing communications with Mr. Rivera as we proceed to trial. Additionally, shorter 
meetings also ensure that Mr. Rivera's meal and recreational time is not infringed upon 
by our calls. Lastly, we also informed the Government, that, as parents of young 
children, Friday evenings are particularly difficult for us to have video calls with Mr. 
Rivera. The Government spoke again with the MCC about our concerns, and the MCC 
refused to modify the above schedule. 
The necessity of increased video calls is because of MCC's continued inability to 
responsibly manage COVID-19. Because of such failures, we cannot meet with Mr. 
Rivera in person. As we stated at the last conference, we are willing to be cooperative 
and flexible in the scheduling of additional video conferences. We have expressed the 
same to the Government. However, the MCC is not doing so. The MCC, once again, is 
choosing to only promote Mr. Rivera's access to discovery and counsel, when ordered by 
the Court and on their terms, without collaboration with us. Accordingly, we need the 
Court's intervention and ask that the MCC be ordered to provide at least 2 two-hour 
additional video calls on days and times agreed to by counsel. 
I Immediately following the conference, we ordered a copy of the transcript. We have not received the 
transcript as of this writing. 
Ms. Louis-Jeune and I adjusted our personal and professional schedules and had a video call with Mr. 
Rivera on Friday, December 18, 2020, from 5:45 p.m. to 9:45 p.m. We also spoke with Mr. Rivera for 30 
minutes in a video call on December I7th (the video call was shortened from I hour to 30 minutes) and ow 
weekly I-hour phone call on December 15th was canceled. This week and the following week, due to the 
holidays, we will again have limited access to Mr. Rivera.

Mr. Rivera's struggles with the MCC concerning receiving and now accessing his 
laptop, and access to counsel, along with his conditions of confinement and reference as 
"enemy #1," are even more troubling considering the accommodations that have been 
made to defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell, a white affluent woman who is detained at the 
Metropolitan Detention Center ("MDC"). As reported by the Government in their recent 
opposition to Ms. Maxwell's renewed bail application, her access to discovery and access 
to counsel is strikingly different and far superior to what is in place for Mr. Rivera. As 
described by the Government, Ms. Maxwell "currently has thirteen hours per day, seven 
days per week to review electronic discovery ... during that time, [she] has access to 
email with defense counsel, calls with defense counsel, and when visiting is available 
depending on pandemic-related conditions, the defendant has access to legal visits. Due 
to the recently implemented lockdown at the MDC, visitation is not currently available, 
but MDC legal counsel is arranging for the defendant to receive a VTC call with legal 
counsel three hours per day every weekday starting this Friday. Defense counsel will be 
able to schedule legal calls on weekends as needed." United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 
Cr. 330 (AJN), Gov't Opp at 29-30, ECF Docket Entry #100 (emphasis added). 
Further, Ms. Maxwell is released from her isolation cell for thirteen hours per day, has 
her own shower, has exclusive use of two different computers, has her own phone to use, 
and has her own television ... Additionally, psychology and medical staff check on the 
defendant daily, MDC legal staff are highly attuned to any complaints the defendant has 
raised, and following initial complaints about the defendant's diet early in her 
incarceration, the MDC has ensured that the defendant receives three full meals per day 
and has access to commissary from which she can supplement her diet." Id., at 31-30. 
Mr. Rivera, and any other inmate, should be treated the same as Ms. Maxwell. 
He, and his counsel, should not be treated any differently because of difference in race, 
gender or class. But, that is exactly what is happening here. Ms. Maxwell can review 
discovery in her cell seven days per week. She also has access to counsel seven days per 
week, and 3 hours per weekday of video calls with counsel. Mr. Rivera should be 
afforded the same, and without repercussion or retribution from staff. 
Thank you again and in advance for your assistance in resolving these issues and 
concerns. 
Respectfully submitted, 
Anthony Cecutti

Epstein 
Judge signs protective order over materials feds to turn over to jailed financier Jeffrey Epstein 
ABC News 
By James Hill and Chris Francescani 
7/26/19 
Judge signs protective order over materials feds to turn over to jailed financier Jeffrey Epstein originally appeared on 
abcnews.go.com 
Federal prosecutors in New York overseeing the case against millionaire Jeffrey Epstein are preparing to hand over highly-
sensitive investigative material to the financier's defense attorneys after a federal judge on Friday granted the 
government's request to place a protective order on the documents. 
Prosecutors sought the order because, they said in court filings, they intends to produce documents and materials that 
could ... "affect the privacy and confidentiality of individuals...[and that) would impede, if prematurely disclosed, the 
Government's ongoing investigation of uncharged individuals." 
When Epstein secured a non-prosecution agreement with federal prosecutors in southern Florida in 2008 over a previous 
investigation, the much-criticized deal also immunized any and all potential co-conspirators, known or unknown, and also 
included the names of four women who had been suspected by authorities of having facilitated or participated in alleged 
crimes against children. 
The deal, which is currently under review by the Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility, allowed 
Epstein to plead guilty to two state counts and avoid federal charges for an allegedly broad pattern of similar conduct. 
Throughout the negotiations -- and for nearly a year after the agreement was signed -- the victims were kept in the dark, 
their attorneys said, claiming they were strung along as government lawyers promised victims they were still investigating 
even long after they had cut the deal with Epstein. 
One of Epstein's accusers in that investigation, 
identified in court documents as "Jane Doe 17 sued the 
Department of Justice in 2008, alleging that the non-prosecution agreement reached with Epstein by federal prosecutors 
in South Florida was hatched in violation of the Crime Victims' Rights Act, which enumerates the rights afforded to victims 
in federal criminal cases, including the right "to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding, or 
any parole proceeding, involving the crime or of any release or escape of the accused." 
In February of this year, U.S. District Court Judge Kenneth Marra ruled in favor of 
and other Epstein accusers, finding 
that the federal government failed to confer with the victims in advance of the deal. Marra is now considering the 
possible remedies for the violation, which could potentially include tearing up the non-prosecutions agreement. 
Epstein, 66 -- who at one time socialized with former President Bill Clinton, Great Britain's Prince Andrew and President 
Donald Trump -- was arrested on July 6 for alleged sex trafficking of minor girls in Florida and New York. Some of the 
charges date back to the early 2000s. 
EFTA00016124
--- PAGE 2 ---
He was indicted on a child sex trafficking and conspiracy charges in which prosecutors charge that he "sexually exploited 
and abused dozens of minor girls at his homes in Manhattan, New York, and Palm Beach, Florida, among other locations," 
using cash payments to recruit a "vast network of underage victims," some of whom were as young as 14 years old. 
Epstein has pleaded not guilty to the latest charges and his defense attorneys have argued in court that the new 
indictment is tantamount to "double jeopardy," the constitutional right that prevents a person from being tried on the 
same (or similar) charges twice, based on the same facts, following a valid acquittal or conviction. 
"It is our belief that this is basically a re-do," Epstein defense attorney Reid Weingarten told the judge at a bail hearing 
earlier this month. "This is basically the feds today, not happy with what happened in the decision that led to the NPA, 
redoing the same conduct that was investigated 10 years ago and calling it, instead of prostitution, calling it sex trafficking. 
We think that is the heart of everything, and that will be the centerpiece of our defense." 
At the same hearing, prosecutors claimed Epstein tried to buy off potential witnesses and charged that he had 
demonstrated a "willingness to use intimidation and aggressive tactics in connection with a criminal investigation." 
Prosecutors allege that late last year Epstein wired $100,000 from a trust account to a person who had been named in the 
2008 case as a possible co-conspirator of Epstein's and then three days later wired $250,000 to another suspected co-
conspirator. 
Weingarten did not respond at the time to an ABC News request for comment on prosecutors' claims of potential witness 
tampering. 
What Jail Is Like for Jeffrey Epstein 
Wall Street Journal 
By Ben Chapman 
7/27/19 
Now sleeping in the bottom bunk of a windowless 8-by-8-foot cell, the financier earlier was denied house arrest at his 
sprawling Manhattan townhouse 
Since his arrest on sex-trafficking charges, financier Jeffrey Epstein has spent much of his time in the bottom bunk of a 
windowless 8-by-8-foot cell, according to the lawyer of his former cellmate. 
The cell is in a wing of a federal jail in downtown Manhattan that is known as "the box" and has been the subject of 
inmate complaints about mice and insect infestations, as well as standing water on the floor, according to lawyers of 
inmates. 
Mr. Epstein's roommate until Tuesday was Nicholas Tartaglione, a retired police officer accused of killing four people, 
according to Mr. Tartaglione's lawyer, Bruce Barket. 
"It is dark and it's disgusting," Mr. Barket said of the jail cell Messrs. Epstein and Tartaglione shared. 
Mr. Epstein, 66 years old, was arrested July 6 and was later denied bail when a judge rejected his lawyers' request that he 
be placed on house arrest in his sprawling Manhattan townhouse, which is valued at $77 million. 
Mr. Epstein had built a fortune of more than half a billion dollars by cultivating his ties to rich and powerful individuals. 
Prosecutors this month said they found a "piles of cash" and dozens of diamonds in a locked safe at his New York 
mansion. 
The financier has pleaded not guilty to sex-trafficking charges stemming from what prosecutors allege was a yearslong 
scheme from 2002 to 2005 to recruit and sexually abuse dozens of girls. 
EFTA00016125
--- PAGE 3 ---
Following his arrest, he has mostly been at the Manhattan jail, which is known as the Metropolitan Correctional Center. 
He was moved to a suicide-watch unit after being found unconscious in his cell Tuesday morning, according to people 
familiar with the matter. 
A lawyer for Mr. Epstein declined to comment. Mr. Tartaglione was interviewed in connection with Mr. Epstein's injuries 
but had no part in them, Mr. Barket said. 
The jail houses 774 inmates, most of them awaiting trial. It has been home to such high-profile inmates as Mexican drug 
lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, who was sentenced earlier this month to life in prison. 
Federal records show that the current occupants include Cesar Sayoc, who pleaded guilty to sending bombs to prominent 
Democrats and is awaiting sentencing, and Sayfullo Saipov, accused of killing eight people by driving a truck on to a 
Manhattan bike path. Mr. Saipov has pleaded not guilty. 
Mr. Epstein and other inmates are allowed to leave their cells for an hour of recreation each day, as well as meetings with 
lawyers, according to a correction officer. 
Mr. Barket said that Messrs. Tartaglione and Epstein were friendly and frequently spoke while they were bunkmates. Mr. 
Tartaglione was arrested in 2016 for killing four people in Chester, N.Y. He has pleaded not guilty. 
Mr. Tartaglione's lawyer has been a vocal critic of the conditions in the jail, filing complaints to correction officials about 
rodents and bugs. 
Lawyers for Mr. Guzman blamed frigid temperatures, lack of clean blankets and contaminated water at the jail as reasons 
for their client's failing health. 
Serene Gregg, a case worker at the Metropolitan Correctional Center and president of the correction workers' union 
chapter, said there are mice and broken toilets and sinks. 
Representatives for the Federal Bureau of Prisons, which manages the Metropolitan Correctional Center, didn't respond to 
questions about the conditions there. 
"There is no worse place you can find yourself," Mr. Barket said. 
Lawmaker says she was warned to back off Jeffrey Epstein case: 'Little girl, you don't know what you're getting into' 
Tampa Bay Times 
By Miami Herald 
7/26/19 
Florida Sen. Lauren Book has reached out to Capitol police after receiving an anonymous warning connected to her 
demand for a state inquiry into Palm Beach Sheriff Ric Bradshaw's handling of accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein's 
lenient work release program, the Miami Herald has learned. 
Book, a vocal advocate for child sexual assault survivors, said she also received more than a dozen calls from Bradshaw's 
political supporters asking her to back off on her call for an investigation by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement 
into Bradshaw. 
On Monday, Book, a Democrat, wrote a letter to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis asking him to authorize a probe into how 
Epstein, accused of molesting dozens of underage girls and a registered sex offender, was permitted to leave the Palm 
Beach County Jail and spend much of his 2008-2009 incarceration in an office in West Palm Beach. 
EFTA00016126
--- PAGE 4 ---
DeSantis said Thursday after a Cabinet meeting that he would "certainly consider" an investigation but that he has yet to 
decide how the state should respond. 
"I saw someone sent me a letter. I looked at it," he said. "I've got to figure out what the proper role of FDLE [is). I know 
they are investigating it down in Palm Beach. ... Clearly when you look at how that happened, if even like 10 percent of 
the things about him are true, then that whole agreement was obviously suspect and willfully below what he should have 
faced." 
While the governor was still weighing the merits of the senator's request, the Palm Beach Sheriff's Office issued a new 
statement that its previously announced internal affairs investigation of the deputies who guarded and supervised Epstein 
during his work release had become a criminal investigation as well. No further elaboration was provided. 
Meanwhile, Book, in an interview with the Herald, said she had asked the Capitol police, who handle security for state 
lawmakers, to look into claims made on a Russian website alleging that Bradshaw was behind an effort to access her 
phone and emails by using the pretext of "imminent danger" to obtain her personal information. 
"I've received countless phone calls saying 'Little girl you don't know what you're getting into; and telling me that I should 
just stop;' said Book, a child sexual abuse survivor herself who has worked to pass strict sex offender laws in Florida. 
In a statement, the Palm Beach Sheriff's Office said it had no knowledge of anyone trying to threaten or pressure Book. 
"Nor has (the Palm Beach Sheriff's Office) made any effort to access her phone or emails as alleged on a salacious website 
run by a disgruntled former employee;' the statement said. 
Pbsotalk.org, the website in question, is a blog tied to a former Palm Beach sheriff's deputy who moved to Russia after 
starting the site, which claims it is dedicated to exposing corruption in the Palm Beach Sheriff's Office. The former deputy, 
John Dougan, fled to Moscow in 2016 following an FBI raid on his Palm Beach home that he claims was politically 
motivated. 
The pressure against Book came on the same day that Epstein, 66, was found injured in his cell at the Metropolitan 
Correctional Center in New York, where he is awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges brought earlier this month by the 
U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. His arrest stemmed from alleged behavior with underage girls dating 
back more than a decade in New York and Florida. Epstein was taken into custody July 6 after arriving at New Jersey's 
Teterboro Airport from Paris on his private jet. 
Epstein was found unconscious in his cell Wednesday evening amid speculation that he may have tried to commit suicide 
or been attacked by another inmate. Jail officials said he was in the lockup Thursday. 
Last Friday, Bradshaw announced the internal affairs investigation after reports emerged that Epstein — while on work 
release in Palm Beach — was allowed female visitors to his office, including at least one visit that led to a sexual 
encounter. The terms of Epstein's incarceration were detailed by the Herald as part of a series published last year about 
Epstein's case, Perversion of Justice. 
who represents several of Epstein's victims, said it is ludicrous to think that Bradshaw is able to investigate 
his own department. 
"The allegations are against the sheriff and there's no way a credible investigation can be conducted by the sheriff's office 
when the allegations extend to the very top of the organization;' 
said. 
Book, whose father, Ron Book, is perhaps the most powerful lobbyist in Florida, said she intends to pressure the governor 
for a full and thorough investigation. 
"The privileges that Epstein received in Palm Beach County were outside the scope of what anyone else would receive. 
We need an independent body to identify whether this was an issue of individual failures or systemic failures. And if it was 
EFTA00016127
--- PAGE 5 ---
an individual failure, we need to hold those individuals accountable," she said. 
Bradshaw, who is running for his fifth term, wields tremendous power in Palm Beach, where the agency has also been the 
lead law enforcement detail assisting the Secret Service during President Donald Trump's visits to Mar-a-Lago. The Palm 
Beach Sheriff's Office spent $5.6 million for Trump's 2017-2018 trips, the Palm Beach Post reported in April. The 
department is reimbursed for the work. 
Epstein was found on the floor of his jail cell with injuries to his neck, according to a report from NBC New York late 
Wednesday. 
The television station said another inmate had been questioned and that Epstein is on suicide watch. A source told CBS 
News the injuries were not life threatening. The New York Post reported that Epstein was taken to a nearby hospital and 
may have intentionally hurt himself in order to win a transfer out of the federal facility. 
Quoting unnamed law enforcement officials, The New York Times said prison officials were treating the incident, which 
left Epstein with "bruising around the neck," as a possible suicide attempt. 
The jet-setting financier was denied bail last week after a federal judge said he posed a danger to young women. His 
lawyers have filed their intent to appeal, saying he should be released to his palatial Upper East Side Manhattan 
townhouse. 
Epstein, who has pleaded not guilty, roamed the halls of power before dozens of underage girls accused him of sexual 
assaults. After preparing a 50-plus-page indictment on sex trafficking charges, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern 
District of Florida shelved the charges and allowed Epstein to plead guilty to minor charges in state court. That's how 
Epstein ended up in the Palm Beach County Jail — and then on work release approved by Sheriff Bradshaw. 
A fixture on the high-society social circuit, he was known to associate with figures such as Bill Clinton, Donald Trump and 
Prince Andrew of Britain. He owns homes around the world, including a mansion in Palm Beach. His lawyers pegged his 
wealth at $559 million in court documents. 
In an email, the Bureau of Prisons said Epstein was currently at the federal jail Thursday morning, not a hospital, but did 
not address his condition or whether an incident had occurred. 
"As with all inmates, for privacy and security reasons, we do not share information on an inmate's medical status or their 
conditions of confinement," the Bureau of Prisons said. 
The federal detention center where Epstein is locked up has been described by The New York Times as "less hospitable 
than Guantanamo Bay." It has also held Joaquin Guzman Loera, the Mexican drug lord known as El Chapo, Ponzi schemer 
Bernie Madoff and Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, who plotted the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, according to the Times. 
This story was written by Miami Herald staff writers Julie K. Brown and Nicholas Nehamas. Times/Herald Tallahassee 
Bureau staff writer Elizabeth Koh contributed to this report. 
One of the earliest known accusations against Jeffrey Epstein was reported to Santa Monica police in 1997 
Insider 
By Kat Tenbarge 
7/26/19 
In a police report obtained by The New York Times and published Thursday, a then-27-year-old model named 
accused the wealthy financier Jeffrey Epstein of a now all-too-familiar sequence of events resulting in what Santa Monica, 
California, officers classified as sexual battery. 
EFTA00016128
--- PAGE 6 ---
Epstein, who registered as a sex offender after a 2008 case, is being held without bail in the Southern District of New York 
on charges of sex trafficking of minors and conspiracy involving dozens of underage girls from at least 2002 to 2005. 
Epstein has pleaded not guilty. 
The newly unearthed police report is one of the earliest known accusations against the financier— 
iled her 
accusation with the Santa Monica Police Department in May 1997. 
In that accusation, .M 
said Epstein identified himself as a talent scout for Victoria's Secret before inviting her to a hotel 
room in Santa Monica for an interview that 
was told could have landed her a spot in the lingerie company's catalog. 
told the police she "started having reservations" before her appointment with Epstein, because "generally, 
interviews are not conducted in hotel rooms." 
Read more: How Jeffrey Epstein, the mysterious hedge-fund manager arrested on sex-trafficking charges, made his 
fortune 
When 
met Epstein in the hotel room for her interview, she told the police, she was "unsure of whether she was 
safe" because he "was attempting to get her to act in an unprofessional manner for a model." She said that included 
Epstein asking her to undress, twice, and on the second time pulling her blouse and skirt up and groping her buttocks 
while saying, "Let me manhandle you for a second." 
M
told The Times she fled in tears and went to the police the next day. She put her report on the record a week later, 
worried that Epstein, whose hands she called "weopons," would use his Victoria's Secret connection to assault other 
women. 
Accusations from other women include descriptions of similar tactics. A former Italian model named 
aid 
Epstein also used his Victoria's Secret connection to attempt to coerce her into sex acts in 2004. 
What's more, The Times reported that two senior executives at L Brands, the company owned by Epstein's only known 
financial-services client and then friend 
knew Epstein was posing as a Victoria's Secret talent scout. L Brands 
was, and still is, the parent company of Victoria's Secret. 
The Times cited the two unnamed former executives as saying they had learned in the mid-1990s that Epstein, then 
serving asl
l financial adviser, was pitching himself to women as a recruiter for the Victoria's Secret catalog. The 
two executives signed nondisclosure agreements while working for 
but told The Times he was made aware that 
Epstein was posing as a Victoria's Secret talent scout. 
promised to take care of the situation at the time, the executives said, but the
remained 
extraordinarily close with Epstein until 18 months after Epstein was charged with an array of sexual misconduct in Palm 
Beach, Florida. After pleading guilty to state prostitution charges in that case, Epstein is now facing new charges accusing 
him of trafficking girls as young as 14. 
In a letter to L Brands employees this month about the new charges, 
said he was "NEVER aware of the illegal 
activity charged in the indictment" and "would never have guessed that a person I employed more than a decade ago 
could have caused such pain to so many people." 
That being said, the relationship between 
and Epstein was extensive, with The Times reporting that 
transferred Epstein's Manhattan mansion, private 727 Boeing jet, and Ohio estate to him from his and L Brands' previous 
assets and that he gave Epstein full control over all his finances from 1991 to 2007.

available to discuss any of the foregoing requests with you when convenient. We reserve the 
right to request further discovery and additional particulars as the case progresses. 
Finally you have asked why we believe that these materials are necessary. In short, we 
intend to file a future Motion to Dismiss based on the September 24, 2007 NPA, contending that 
properly construed it constitutes a global resolution of Mr. Epstein's then-existing offense 
conduct. Further, we believe that a production of the requested documents would reflect 
communications between the various identified United States Attorney's Offices that would be 
inconsistent with the duty to not circumvent or transfer a case from the immunizing district to 
another district even if the NPA is ultimately determined to be venue specific. We also will 
contend that the documented efforts of the Southern District of Florida, see Jane Doe v United 
States Dkt 205-2, 08 cv 80736 and more recent interactions between the Northern District of 
Georgia which stands in the shoes of the Southern District of Florida with victims and their 
attorneys was inconsistent with the immunity-commitments that were incorporated into the NPA.

Any documents or information relating to promises made or any

seeking restitution or any other form of monetary benefit as a 
potential result of his conviction. 
B. 
The date of and participants in each and every interview (including not only 
interviews conducted by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of 
New York, but also interviews conducted by other law enforcement entities and 
any third parties), debriefing, "queen for a day" session, proffer, deposition, or 
other statement or description of the alleged facts made by each potential 
government witness (whether directly or indirectly, such as a proffer made by 
counsel). In addition, please specify, as to each such winless, the first date on 
which the witness made any allegation that Mr. Epstein engaged in any allegedly 
unlawful conduct or any conduct alleged in the Indictment. 
C. 
As you are aware, New York has adopted Rule of Professional Conduct 3.8, 
entitled "Special Responsibilities of Prosecutors and Other Government 
Lawyers," which provides that a prosecutor shall "make timely disclosure to 
counsel for the defendant ... of the existence of evidence or information known 
the prosecutor or other government lawyer that tends to negate the guilt of the 
accused, mitigate the degree of the offense, or reduce the sentence. . . ." Rule 
3.8(d). The Supreme Court has recognized that Rule 3.8 imposes a higher 
standard on prosecutors than the standards mandating disclosure of exculpatory 
evidence under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963). See Kyles v. Whitley, 514 
U.S. 419, 437 (1995) ("[Brady) requires less of the prosecution than the ABA 
Standards for Criminal Justice, which call generally for prosecutorial disclosures 
of any evidence tending to exculpate or mitigate"); ABA Standards for Criminal 
Justice, Prosecution Function and Defense Function 3-3.11(a) (3d ed. 1993) ("A 
prosecutor should not intentionally fail to make timely disclosure to the defense, 
at the earliest feasible opportunity, of the existence of all evidence or information 
which tends to negate the guilt of the accused or mitigate the offense charged or 
which would tend to reduce the punishment of the accused"); ABA Model Rule of 
Professional Conduct 3.8(d) (1984) ("The prosecutor in a criminal case shall.. . 
make timely disclosure to the defense of all evidence or information known to the 
prosecutor that tends to negate the guilt of the accused or mitigates the offense"). 
Mr. Epstein contends that the foregoing categories of information constitute 
Brady and Rule 3.8(d) material, and that disclosure should take place 
immediately. Mr. Epstein further requests that the government identify with 
particularity and provide copies of all materials that qualify as Brady and Rule 3.8 
material, as described above. Please advise us promptly whether the government 
will be producing Brady material immediately even if it is contained in what 
might otherwise be considered as Jencks material, or whether you take the 
position that you arc not obligated to produce such material at this time. 
EFTA00016145
--- PAGE 11 ---
August 1, 2019 
Page 11 
Steptoe 
110101 • JOHNSON LI 
D. 
Mr. Epstein also requests the underlying source material for any Brady and Rule 
3.8(d) information, as opposed to any summary letter or paraphrased description 
of the information. Please advise us promptly whether the government will be 
producing underlying source material. 
E. 
For purposes of the Brady doctrine, "the format of the information does not 
determine whether it is discoverable." Department Memorandum for Department 
Prosecutors Providing Guidance for Prosecutors Regarding Criminal Discovery, 
at 6 (Jan. 4, 2010). For example, material exculpatory information that is 
provided "during a conversation with an agent or a witness is no less discoverable 
than if that same information were contained in an email." Id. Similarly, the 
Second Circuit has recognized that attorney proffers are equally subject to Brady 
obligations as witness proffers. States V. Triumph Capital Group, Inc., 544 F.3d 
149, 157, 165 (2d Cir. 2008) (recognizing that "[a]n attorney proffer apprises the 
government of what the client would be able to provide by way of testimony" and 
finding a Brady violation where the government failed to turn over notes from an 
attorney proffer). Mr. Epstein therefore expects that all such information will be 
memorialized and produced to Mr. Epstein. 
F. 
Finally, Mr. Epstein notes Rule 4.C.3 of Judge Berman's Individual Practices, 
which, inter alia, (1) requires disclosure of Brady materials within two weeks of 
its discovery; (2) re-affirms that the government's obligation applies "regardless 
of whether the Government 'credits' the Brady Material"; and (3) re-affirms that 
the government's obligations extend to "law enforcement and regulatory agencies 
that are or have been involved in the prosecution of the defendant or in parallel 
proceedings or investigations involving the defendant." 
V. 
Jencks Material 
Pursuant to the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3500, and Rule 26.2 of the Federal Rules of 
Criminal Procedure, Mr. Epstein requests that the government provide a list of the names and 
addresses of all witnesses (and their counsel) that the government intends to call in its case-in-
chief and all statements of those witnesses in the possession, custody, or control of the 
government or any other governmental entity, including but not limited to notes of interviews, 
FBI 302s, or other summaries prepared by government attorneys or agents, and grand jury 
transcripts and any other witness statements. Mr. Epstein requests that the government begin 
providing this material as soon as possible, or in any event no later than February 8, 2020 or, if 
there is a setting of the trial date after June 8, 2020, one hundred and twenty days before that trial 
date

B. 
Mr. Epstein requests that the government disclose whether it intends to introduce 
any evidence obtained in the manner described in Section XM.A.1-6. If the 
government intends to do so, Mr. Epstein requests that the government: (1) 
identify such evidence; (2) identify the source of the evidence; and (3) disclose 
any warrant and supporting affidavits related to the collection of the evidence. 
XIII. Seized Information that is Unresponsive or Subject to the Attorney-Client Privilege 
It is our understanding that the government has seized materials — including computers 
and othcr portable electronics — that are likely to contain documents and information that are: (I) 
outside the scope of the search warrant which purportedly authorized the starch ("Unresponsive 
Data") and/or (2) subject to the attorney-client privilege, the attorney work product doctrine, and 
other privileges ("Privileged Data") (collectively, "Seized Data'). 6 As an initial matter, Mr. 
Epstein requests that the government produce these materials to defense counsel in their entirety. 
Mr. Epstein further requests that the government maintain and preserve audit logs that record 
what files were searched, when and by whom, and whether additional copies were made. 
With respect to Unresponsive Data, Mr. Epstein requests that the Government: (1) 
employ search terms or other protocols to ensure that any review of irrelevant documents was 
limited and that irrelevant documents are promptly segregated; (2) disclose such protocols to the 
defense; and (3) return any non-seized documents (and the media from which they were 
collected) as soon as possible to Mr. Epstein. See Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41(g). 
With respect to Privileged Data, Mr. Epstein further requests that the government 
establish sound procedures to ensure any Privileged Data is appropriately protected, including 
but not limited to use of a privilege (or "taint") team to review the documents. We are pleased to 
provide the privilege team a list of counsel to Mr. Epstein to aid in this review. 
• 
* 
Please advise us whether the government will provide the requested information so that 
Mr. Epstein can determine whether it will be necessary to move for a bill of particulars or file 
other discovery-related motions. For any request for which there is a dispute, Mr. Epstein 
requests that you take all necessary steps to ensure the documents and information are preserved 
by their custodian. 
Mr. Epstein reserves all rights to challenge the search and seizure of these materials.

Dear Ms. Strauss, 
I applaud your arrest of Ghislaine Maxwell. 
She no doubt has powerful friends, but if certain people don't have 
to obey the law or face its consequences because of money, 
power or connections. I fear we are lost. 
Allowing certain people to not face the law's consequences is but a 
short step from targeting certain people or groups for legal 
harassment or trumped up imprisonment. 
Without uniform enforcement of the law, laws are meaningless, our 
constitution is meaningless, and the freedoms we value so highly 
in this country would evaporate. 
I wanted to thank you for your fight and sacrifice to maintain the 
integrity of the Southern District of New York and for your work to 
uphold the rule of law in the US. 
Thank you for fighting for us,

GHISLAINE MAXWELL CHARGED IN MANHATTAN 
FEDERAL COURT FOR CONSPIRING WITH JEFFREY 
EPSTEIN TO SEXUALLY ABUSE MINORS 
Maxwell is Alleged to Have Facilitated, Participated in Acts of Abuse 
Additionally Charged With Perjury in Connection With 2016 
Depositions 
NEW YORK CITY - Audrey Strauss, the Acting U.S. Attorney for the Southern 
District of New York, William F. Sweeney Jr., the Assistant Director in Charge of 
the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and 
Dermot Shea, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department (NYPD), 
announced that Ghislane Maxwell was arrested this morning and charged with 
enticing a minor to travel to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a 
minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, conspiracy to commit 
both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. 
The indictment unsealed today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 
through 1997, Maxwell and co-conspirator Jeffrey Epstein exploited girls as young 
as 14, including by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the purpose 
of engaging in illegal sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference 
for young girls, Maxwell played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor 
victims that took place in locations including New York, Florida, and New 
Mexico. In addition, as alleged, Maxwell made several false statements in sworn 
depositions in 2016. Maxwell is expected to be presented this afternoon in federal 
court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. 
Nathan. 
Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell 
facilitated, aided, and participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell 
enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then delivered them into the trap 
that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could 
trust. All the while, she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, 
in some cases, Maxwell herself. Today, after many years, Ghislaine Maxwell 
finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of 
children is among the most important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like 
Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the law and her responsibility 
as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable 
youth into behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the 
potential for lasting harm. We know the quest for justice has been met with great 
disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. The 
example set by the women involved has been a powerful one. They persevered 
EFTA00016167
--- PAGE 3 ---
against the rich and connected, and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a 
subpoena — and they stood together. I have no doubt the bravery exhibited by the 
women involved here has empowered others to speak up about the crimes of 
which they've been subjected." 
NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said: "The heinous crimes these charges 
allege are, and always will be abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on 
victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement partners, for their 
continuing commitment to bringing justice to the survivors of sexual assault, 
everywhere." 
If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by 
Jeffrey Epstein, please contact the FBI at i-800-CALL FBI, and 
reference this case. 
According to the indictment[i] unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
From at least 1994 through at least 1997, Ghislane Maxwell assisted, facilitated, 
and participated in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, 
helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and ultimately abuse victims known to 
Maxwell and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as young as 14 
years old when they were groomed and abused by Maxwell and Epstein, both of 
whom knew that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of 
their scheme to abuse minor victims, Maxwell and Epstein enticed and caused 
minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, which Maxwell 
knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual 
abuse. 
As alleged, Maxwell enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple 
ways. For example, Maxwell attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them 
about their lives, taking them to the movies or taking them on shopping trips, and 
encouraging their interactions with Epstein. Maxwell also acclimated victims to 
Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, 
which put victims at ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult 
woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. Additionally, to make 
victims feel indebted to Epstein, Maxwell would encourage victims to accept offers 
of financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or 
educational expenses. Maxwell also normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by 
discussing sexual topics with victims, encouraging them to massage Epstein, and 
undressing in front of a victim. 
As Maxwell and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims 
vulnerable and susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. Maxwell was then present 
for certain sexual encounters between minor victims and Epstein, such as 
interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately Maxwell was 
present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included 
sexualized massages during which a minor victim was fully or partially nude, as 
EFTA00016168
--- PAGE 4 ---
well as group sexualized massages of Epstein involving a minor victim where 
Maxwell was present. 
As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among 
other things, the touching of a victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a 
vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to touch Epstein while he 
masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. Maxwell and 
Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, 
Florida, and New Mexico, as well as Maxwell's residence in London, England. 
Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, Maxwell 
repeatedly made false statements, including about certain specific acts and events

Mike Monico and Barry Spevack called on behalf of Cohen. They asked whether we would file a Rule 35, and requested a 
meeting to discuss it. I asked what had changed since we told them, on April 17, that we did not intend to file such a 
motion. They said that Cohen "has heard Trump say things about Epstein," but would not get into detail at this time 
about what those were. They then attempted to rehash our April 17 conversation about Rule 35, and asked for specifics 
about what Cohen had done to undermine his credibility. I said I would consider whether we were willing to provide 
more specifics.

Re: 
United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 (RMB) 
Dear Judge Berman: 
The Government respectfully submits this letter to briefly respond to one aspect of the 
defendant's July 16, 2019 letter (ECF No. 24), and to provide the Court with additional information 
regarding the defendant's foreign passport. The defendant's July 16, 2019 letter asserts: "[A]s for 
the Austrian passport the government trumpets, it expired 32 years ago. And the government offers 
nothing to suggest—and certainly no evidence—that Epstein ever used it." (ECF No. 24 at 7). In 
fact, the passport contains numerous ingress and egress stamps, including stamps that reflect use 
of the passport to enter France, Spain, the United Kingdom, and Saudi Arabia in the 1980s. 
The Government further notes that the defendant's submission does not address how the 
defendant obtained the foreign passport and, more concerning, the defendant has still not disclosed 
to the Court whether he is a citizen or legal permanent resident of a country other than the United 
States.

I tried using the exe file a couple times and it crashed my computer both times. But I can follow up with FBI. 
And in any event these two devices are a tiny percentage overall, and not the ones we expect may have useful 
evidence in connection with Maxwell — for that we want the servers with old emails, rather than devices 
purchased and used years after Maxwell was out of the picture.

Just to confirm, this estimate is for everything from both SWs, right? It looks like the attached email contemplates 57

Following up on the below, I think we've given this our absolute best efforts with FBI — they are now well over a month 
later than their estimate from April on when we would get the New York materials, they're also past their estimate of 
getting us the New York materials from just this Monday, and we don't have anything close to an estimate on the USVI 
materials, which constitute the overwhelming majority of the data and are vastly more voluminous than the New York 
devices. We have kept pushing the timeline back for this option, hoping that CART will finalize, but I think at this point 
we should have a vendor do it. 
Attached is an estimate we got from BRG, which would get everything to us in under a month, and in Relativity-friendly 
format, in a range of $85-135K. BRG has done this for our office multiple times in the past and are very effective and 
efficient, and they get the materials we need. And most importantly, they estimate they can do it all in less than a 
month. May we have approval to seek funding for this? The estimate is attached. Thanks very much.

I am in the process ofAtoorting the materials (documents, spreadsheets, emails, etc) for your review as per

Most of the NY stuff is done, just Mac items left. This might take a few days as 1 
item in particular has over 500,000 emails. We will be able to provide discovery once Defense Council has

Unfortunately, recent events and our staffing levels have conspired to put a kink in just about everything. If 
we can't make heads or tails of the stuff I've already produced, we'll do it again. They have told us that our 
staffing levels will be steadily increasing over the next few weeks, but I'm going to have to push back my 
estimate by a week or 2. Sony about that. My next day in the office is Thursday, so I'll be able to see if I can

Separately, to follow up on a question from the May 15 email below, the list has just five devices as still pending to be

searchable format, but just wanted to confirm? Currently, we aren't able to match any of the prior productions to 
specific devices — so if we're able to match them up by Bates number now, that might work, but otherwise I think it

And related to that question, are we still on track to get the full range of data in the next week or so? I don't think

Thanks for this, it's a helpful start. In terms of being able to write our search warrant, one additional piece of 
information we need is the serial number, or some other specific identifier, ideally for each device but at least for any 
device that there is more than one of the same thing. So for example, we need to be able to somehow differentiate 
the following devices —
The two Dell power edge T310 hard drives (NYCO24323 and NYCO24324) 
The two Sony Vaio laptop / Fujitsu hdd (NYCO24336 and NYCO24337) 
the following loose storage devices: 
o Micro SD card (NYCO24339) 
o Flash Drive (generic) (NYCO24340) 
o Thumbdrive (Emtec) (NYCO24341) 
o hard drive (loose) (NYCO24342) 
o verbatim thumbdrive (NYCO24343) 
The four San Disk cruzer-thumbdrives (NYCO24344-47) 
The three Seagate IDE hard drives (NYCO24348-50) 
The camera SD card (NYCO24351) 
I think the rest of the devices are either specifically distinguishable and/or have an S/N listed. (By comparison, the 
USVI spreadsheet we have lists an s/n for about 20 of the 25(ish) devices. 
The other thing we're looking for is the location in the house (and ideally specific location) for each device, which the 
USVI list also has — is that info available? 
EFTA00016186
--- PAGE 8 ---
The list also has just five devices as still pending to be transferred to us, and I think it's right that the plan is to 
reproduce all the materials so that we can get them in searchable format, but just wanted to confirm? Currently, we 
aren't able to match any of the prior productions to specific devices — so if we're able to match them up by Bates 
number now, that might work, but otherwise I think it makes sense for us to get everything. But let us know if any 
issue with that. 
thanks very much,

Here is The listing of all the evidence gathered in NY that I have. I added some columns to guide you to the 
unique numbers CART NY uses fro their evidence. The template wasn't a slam dunk over, so I did what I 
could to convey the information. If you are confused by anything, please let me know. In the column for 
approximate size, it is in GB, totaled at the bottom and converted to TB. In the materials contained column, I 
put what load file group the data was transferred over in (Mac, Windows, Loose Media, IDE, or Blacklight) If 
there is no entry in that column, that data has yet to be transferred. There are 2 Macs and a DVR you don't 
have as well as an iPhone and an iPad. IF the descriptions are a bit light, let me know and I'll do what I can to 
beef them up. I will get you the Island stuff tomorrow.

Respectfully, I think there are some miscommunications here — all we have asked is to receive the materials in a format 
such that we can view them using a system we have access to. We're not able to get web-enabled access through any 
FBI tool, so we asked for the materials to be transferred in a loadable format so we could put them on Relativity, which 
both we and the agents can access. We're required to have the files in a format that we can produce them to defense 
counsel. I've done that in many other cases and it hasn't previously been an issue. My understanding from 
is 
that the best way to do it now is just for us (the U.S. Attorney's Office) to get the original files, which our vendor will 
EFTA00016187
--- PAGE 9 ---
process—by which I just mean converting into file formats that are loadable onto Relativity. It doesn't really have 
anything to do with the taint review—we have to have access to the docs in our systems for discovery purposes. 
And we were happy to get the materials as they were processed, but when we received the 1.1 million documents 
earlier this year, they were in a format that wasn't usable for the reasons described in the email I sent on March 9. 
Again, I understand from 
that the best way forward is to just get copies of the materials in their original formats, 
which I understand will be segregated and designated by device. That should work for us! I was just trying to 
understand the approach, as well as the timeline. 
thanks,

Just to be clear. The US Attorney's Office (or it's contractors) are not "processing" anything. You are taking 
files that I will be extracting from processed evidence and putting them into an E-Discovery tool (Relativity) 
to do a taint review. 
Relativity is NOT a forensic tool. It is incapable of dealing with many things that are found forensically on a 
computer like free space, slack space, and system files to name a few. When we started this, and you insisted 
you do the taint review in Relativity, I warned you that it was adding months worth of work on top of what 
was already done, and that Relativity was incapable of viewing everything. You insisted we do it this way. So 
now 
and I have come up with a way to fit this round peg into this square hole. We will get it done. 
Sorry it has taken so long, but we are talking about terabytes worth of data over multiple forms of digital 
evidence. Phones, tablets, loose media, cameras, DVRs, servers, laptops, and desktop computers. We have 
gotten past encryption on multiple devices. When we review devices on such large cases, we usually do it 
piece by piece as things are processed, I was unaware that you didn't want to review as things were 
processed, that you wanted to do it "all at once", so that added to the delay. Sorry for that. Just a 
differentiation of methodology I suppose. 
and I feel confident that the method we have come up with will be more consistent and preserve the 
attribution of files to devices and links of e-mails to attachments that the load file generation that I did a 
while back was lacking.

Okay, so just to check, you both think that there is not a need to do a test run? You're both comfortable with just 
basically sending us copies of everything? I don't totally understand why we couldn't have done that eight months 
ago, but regardless of the passage of time, I want to make sure we understand so we can report to our supervisors. I 
assume that means that we (at the U.S. Attorney's Office and through contractors) will therefore need to do all the 
processing ourselves, correct? And thanks again to you both.

Unfortunately I don't think this is very helpful to us. Did you take a look at the example spreadsheet I sent on 2/24? 
The excel file you sent has descriptions that don't match up to the items listed in the search warrant returns (that we 
sent on 2/23), and we don't have the 1B or CART numbers to be able to cross-reference. We also can't tell what you 
mean by "loose media" without a specific comparison to what was seized, we don't know which items you're referring 
to as "Windows machines," and we can't tell whether the entirety of any particular item has been transferred, or just 
partial. For example, it looks like we have gotten very, very few image files, which is surprising. 
We have also encountered some very significant problems in trying to review the more than 1 million documents we 
recently received: 
The data we've received has no way to put any emails and attachments together. So if an email says, "see the 
attached flight records," for example, we have no way of linking that up with the records themselves. Not only 
is that a big problem for us in review, it's going to be a huge problem for producing the documents to defense 
counsel. 
- 
The load file has no link to the native file, so when we load the data to the database, there's no way to have 
the native files show up in the database. Because many of the files are too large to open in the viewer, it 
effectively means that there are many files that are completely invisible to us. 
- 
Related, the control numbers in the load file don't match up to the native files. So we have two sets of 
numbers and no way to match up anything—that is, even if we were to try to go hunt down every individual 
large file in the native files, it would be impossible. 
So the data that we most recently got, we need to get in a form that addresses those issues, and we likely will need to 
get a similar reproduction of the data we received a couple months ago. Otherwise we're sifting through more than a 
million documents without much rhyme or reason. 
I've re-attached the spreadsheet we sent last week — I think that's a good place to start in terms of our necessary 
record-keeping, and we need that info at the very least, as well as anything else you think would be useful. Also 
attaching the SW returns for reference. And again, we're happy to meet up anytime and hash all this out in person if 
that's useful.

Here is a listing of what I have already handed over in load files to the US Attorney's Office for taint review. Some 
points of clarification: There were 9 IDE hard drives found in the Manhattan apartment, they turned out to be 3 copies 
of 3 drives (9 drives in total) from a July 2007 search on one of his properties. I only processed 3 (as they were all 
copies). All the loose media from the NY apartment is included. All the Windows machines from the NY apartment are 
included. Only 2 Macs from NY and 1 from the Island are included. 
I will have to more closely coordinate with whoever is loading up Relativity with the remaining Macs as the 
tool they have to be processed with does not easily re-name the load files. 
Spreadsheet is attached.

Sony for the delayed response. They are tearing out our old network and giving us a new one, they mandated 
we delete old stuff (about 400 TB worth). Now that they are working on replacing the network, we can do 
only local work. I should be able to give you an accounting of what is what. I can say, off the top of my head, 
that all windows based items from the NY search have been handed over as well as all loose media. The CDs 
from NY only contained pictures, no documents. There are still some Apple items from NY that need to be 
produced. As far as the Island stuff goes, the 1st item on your spreadsheet, the "kitchen" mac has been 
produced. Still working on the rest.

which devices the materials came from, whether it's full or partial results, how many more devices we have coming,

Based on the attached search warrant returns, it looks like from the New York mansion (the PDF) there are 
approximately 40 devices that would have storage (computers, hard drives, thumb drives, etc.) and that's not even 
counting at least 60+ CDs. And then from the Virgin Islands (the Excel spreadsheet), at least more than 25 devices, 
including multiple servers / server racks. 
So we gotta know what we've already received, what remains, anticipated schedule, etc, and I know it's a lot of 
moving pieces on all sides so wanted to loop in everybody at once. The case team will be in California this coming

I'm not sure who's the exact right person to ask this, so wanted to get everybody on one email chain about it — I have 
the hard drive that 
dropped off that has new Epstein search warrant materials, but it looks like there are also 
old materials (that I think we had previously received and uploaded??) on the hard drive, and so I'm not sure what's 
new. 
Just generally, and 
and I talked about this last week too, but it's basically impossible for us to keep track of what 
we're getting, and what has been completed, without some kind of identification or labeling system, along with a list 
of which devices have been extracted and downloaded. 
So for example on the hard drive currently, there are 38 folders labeled "loadFiles" through "37loadFiles" with a 
modified date of 11/14/19, which I think we may have already previously received — but I'm not sure, because we 
haven't gotten any info on which folders match up to which devices, etc. And then there's another folder titled 
"NYCO24362" that has a modified date of 1/27/20, so I think that may be the materials we hadn't previously received? 
That folder by itself has more than 600,000 items. 
EFTA00016196
--- PAGE 18 ---
I don't want to give 
anything that we've already previously received and uploaded, and I can't tell from the folder 
or file names whether everything on the drive is new, or whether just additional materials were saved onto it in 
addition to what we already have. 
, are you able to give us some guidance on this? Ultimately what we really 
need is a spreadsheet of every device, whether it's been dumped (or partially dumped), and then identifying that 
same info — which device, and what materials from it — are being given to us with each data transfer. Otherwise I think 
organizationally and for review purposes it will be a total disaster for us. 
We're happy to have a meeting on this if that's helpful — and thanks everybody for the assistance.

Subject: Corruption , Epstein, and Ghislaine 
Hi, 
My name is 
and I reside in NH. I have been reporting a group of wealthy real estate developers, 
nightclub and restaurant owners, along with rogue police who cater to them, donate for them, and seemingly 
offer private police services to them. 
One of the MA troopers is the brother of the nightclub owners and he's close to pedophile wealthy developer 
Wm. O'Connell. (arrested for statutory rape and cocaine trafficking) 
I have come across new information which leads me to believe the above group is tied to Epstein, and even 
Ghislaine, but definitely the million dollar homes where she lived and the LLC's connected to them. 
I have attached these documents on both a Google doc and PDF file for your viewing. 
I know this group, with the exception of the pedophile and nightclub owners, because I was married to one I 
divorced over twenty years ago, I dated another, and socialized with them. I have been compiling their 
corruption for over ten years and have received enormous amounts of abuse and crimes committed against me 
for doing so, and LE hasn't done one thing to stop them. 
But, I'm still here sending my reports on them, and they're still issuing threats. This pedophile's victim was killed 
in a fiery crash one week before his trial was to begin, so he got off those charges. But the similarities between 
both he and Epstein are astounding, but I'm sure they knew him. See attached, 
Bill O'Connnell

Hey, I think after we indicted Epstein I set up an Outlook rule that automatically forwarded court bounces to you and 
— would you like me to do that for Maxwell? No problem at all if not, we're totally happy to just keep you posted, 
but if that's helpful let me know.

--- PAGE 4 ---
Ghislaine Maxwell moves in limine to exclude any evidence the Government seeks to 
admit at trial under Fed. R. Evid. 404(b) (the "Rule"). That Rule, as amended in December 
2020, expressly requires particularized notice to the defense of the exact evidence to be offered, 
an articulated non-propensity purpose for its admission, and the reasoning supporting that 
purpose. Despite notice of the rule change and an opportunity to comply with the Rule by this 
Court's deadline of October 11, the Government opted not to follow the requirements of the Rule 
and should now be foreclosed from offering any evidence pursuant to Rule 404(6). 
BACKGROUND 
I. 2020 Amendments to Rule 404(6) 
Rule 404 sets forth the requirements for "Notice in a Criminal Case" of an intent to 
introduce evidence under the rule: 
"In a criminal case, the prosecutor must: 
(A) provide reasonable notice of any such evidence that the prosecutor intends to offer at 
trial, so that the defendant has a fair opportunity to meet it; 
(B) articulate in the notice the permitted purpose for which the prosecutor intends to offer 
the evidence and the reasoning that supports the purpose; and 
(C) do so in writing before trial — or in any form during trial of the court, for good cause, 
excuses lack of pretrial notice." 
Fed. R. Evid. 404(b)(3). In December 2020, the Rule was "amended principally to 
impose additional notice requirements in a criminal case." Fed. R. Evid. 404, Advisory 
Committee Notes, 2020 Amendments. Prior to the rule change, the prosecution needed only to 
give notice of the "general nature" of the anticipated evidence; thus, "some courts...permit[ted] 
the government to satisfy the notice obligation without describing the specific act that the 
evidence would tend to prove, and without explaining the relevance of the evidence for a non-
propensity purpose" (id.). 
EFTA00016209
--- PAGE 5 ---
After December 2020, according to the Advisory Committee, the new subsection (B) 
requires that: 
The prosecution must not only identify the evidence that it intends to offer 
pursuant to the rule but also articulate a non-propensity purpose for which the 
evidence is offered and the basis for concluding that the evidence is relevant in 
light of this purpose. 
Id. (emphasis added). The Rule's requirement that the prosecution must "identify the evidence," 
"articulate a non-propensity purpose" and a "basis for concluding the evidence is relevant in light 
of this purpose" replaced the previous notice requirement only of the "general nature" of 
anticipated evidence. The "advance notice" is "important so that the parties and the court have 
adequate opportunity to assess the evidence, the purpose for which it is offered, and whether the 
requirements of Rule 403 have been satisfied ...." Id. 
The new rule also required that the pre-trial notice be done in writing, "sufficiently ahead 
of trial to give the defendant a fair opportunity to meet the evidence." Rule 404(b)(3)(A). "The 
'air opportunity' must include sufficient time for an independent investigation that might surface 
evidence that refutes, mitigates, or places the other act in a different light. Prosecutors who cut 
the disclosure too close to the trial date risk a judge either excluding the evidence so that the trial 
can proceed as scheduled or delaying the trial so the defense can "meet" the other act proof. Easy 
to overlook is that the judge too needs time to consider the admissibility of the other act 
evidence." See Wright & Miller, 22B Fed. Prac. & Proc. Evid., § 5242.1 2020 Amendments to 
Rule 404(b) (2021). 
II. Rule 404(b) Notice in This Case 
The Government advised this Court that it could provide notice of any Rule 404(b) 
evidence by 45 days prior to trial, which would afford it "adequate time to finalize its 
determination of what evidence it will seek to introduce at trial pursuant to" the Rule. See Dkt. 
EFTA00016210
--- PAGE 6 ---
229 at 3. This Court then ordered the Government to provide disclosure of any "Rule 404(b) 
evidence and notice" by October 11. Dkt. 297. 
On October 11, 2021, the Government served on defense counsel a short letter entitled 
the "Maxwell Rule 404(b) letter" (the "Rule 404(b) Letter" or the "Letter"), attached as Exhibit 
A. In it, the Government referenced two sets of evidence: (a) certain emails purportedly between 
Ms. Maxwell and third-party "influential" men whom she allegedly tried to set up on dates, and 
(b) a witness, 
a woman who worked for Epstein between 2005-06 (after the 
conclusion of the charged conspiracy) whom the Government said it "may call" at trial. The 
Government asserted in the Letter that the evidence collectively was, in its opinion, "direct 
evidence of the crimes charged and, in the alternative, pursuant to Rule 404(b) as proof of the 
defendant's intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, and/or absence of mistake of (sic) 
accident." Id. at 2. The Government stated it would not be moving in limine to seek the 
evidence's admission "[b]ecause this evidence is admissible as direct evidence." Id. The Letter 
lacked identification of any particular purpose for these two categories of evidence and lacked 
any "basis for concluding that the evidence is relevant in light of this purpose." 
Also on October 11, the Government provided its anticipated trial exhibits. Even a quick 
review of those exhibits reflects the Government's apparent intent to offer numerous documents 
and other evidence that purportedly occurred after the conclusion of the charged conspiracy. 
See, e.g., GX-4-D through GX-4-K (message pads dated beginning in 2005); GX-423 (an 
Amazon shipment to Jeffrey Epstein of an iPhone USB lightning cable in 2013); GX-501 & 502 
(financial statements from June 2007); GX-661 & 662 (flight logs from 2005-13). None of these 
items of evidence were mentioned in the Maxwell Rule 404(b) Letter. The Government's theory 
of admissibility concerning this post-2004 evidence remains unclear. 
EFTA00016211
--- PAGE 7 ---
ARGUMENT 
I. By Failing to Comply with the Rule 404(b) Notice Requirement, the 
Government Has Waived the Admission of Any Evidence Pursuant to the 
Rule 
Under the version of Rule 404(b) in effect for this trial, the Government was required to 
specifically "identify" any evidence it intends to offer under the Rule, to "articulate...the 
permitted purpose for which" the identified evidence will be offered, and to state the "reasoning 
that supports the purpose." The Government did not timely comply with these requirements and 
should therefore be precluded from offering any evidence under Rule 404(b). 
To be sure, the Rule 404(b) Letter did "identify" several emails purportedly between Ms. 
Maxwell and two other adult men that discuss fixing them up with women on a date. But even 
though the Government claimed these emails may be admissible "in the alternative, pursuant to 
Rule 404(b)," there is nothing in the Letter which states the permitted purpose for which they 
might be offered, nor the "reasoning that supports that purpose." Ms. Maxwell is unable to guess 
which of the laundry list of potential purposes contained in Rule 404(b) might serve as the 
grounds, and she certainly is not able to guess the Government's "reasoning." Without the 
required notice, both defense counsel and the Court cannot undertake the required analysis to 
determine whether the evidence is being offered for a proper non-propensity purpose, is relevant 
to a disputed issue, can satisfy a Rule 403 analysis, or needs a limiting instruction. United States 
v. Bui, 859 F. App'x 610 (2d Cir. 2021) (summary order) (quoting United States v. Brand, 467 
F.3d 179, 196 (2d Cir. 2006)). 
The Government likewise did "identify" Ms. 
as a potential witness and offered 
two, non-exclusive potential topics of her testimony. The Government advised that she will 
testify about, "among other things, [i] certain [unspecified] documentary evidence relating to the 
EFTA00016212
--- PAGE 8 ---
charged crimes [and (ii)] her [unspecified] role in scheduling sexualized massages for Jeffrey 
Epstein with underage girls," apparently in 2005-06. This is hardly the type of "identiff ied]" 
evidence the Rule contemplates. What "documentary evidence" will she testify about? What 
"role" did she play in scheduling massages after the conclusion of the charged conspiracy? For 
what purpose will she testify to it? Are there other topics covered by the language "among other 
things" that the Government submits is admissible under Rule 404(b)? What is it? What is the 
purpose of it? Will it be offered to prove Ms. Maxwell's "intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, 
identity and/or absence of mistake of [sic] accident" or something else? How is it permissible 
non-propensity evidence? 
Finally, by failing to identify the numerous exhibits that fall after the period of the 
conspiracy in the Rule 404(b) Letter, the Government has also waived any right to argue that 
those documents should be admitted under the rule as well. 
The entire point of the change to Rule 404(b), and this Court's scheduling Order, is to 
permit Ms. Maxwell to investigate, analyze, dispute, move in limine if appropriate, or rebut the 
proffered Rule 404(b) evidence. There is nothing in Rule 404(b) that excuses the required 
Notice in the event the Government only offers the evidence "in the alternative" under the rule. 
By disregarding the requirements of Rule 404(b), the Government has chosen to deprive Ms. 
Maxwell of her right to dispute the admissibility of this evidence. 
II. Should the Government's Failure Be Excused, Ms. Maxwell Requests an 
Opportunity to Rebut any Proffered Non-Propensity Purpose and Basis 
Because the Government has not identified the non-propensity purpose nor reasoning 
underlying the admission of any Rule 404(b) evidence, the defense is left without "sufficient 
time for an independent investigation that might surface evidence that refutes, mitigates, or 
places the other act in a different light," and the Court will not have sufficient "time to consider 
EFTA00016213
--- PAGE 9 ---
the admissibility of the other act evidence." Wright & Miller, supra. Should the Government 
request a "good-cause" exemption for their failure to timely provide Rule 404(b) notice, this 
Court should analyze their excuse with skepticism. "Prosecutors should be prepared to explain 
their change of heart and to rebut allegations of sandbagging. Unforeseen turns of testimony at 
trial are one thing. Reasonably anticipated proof problems are another. For example, when intent 
is an element of a charged offense, a prosecutor will be hard pressed to explain why he did not 
foresee before trial that the other act proof may be important in a jury's determination of intent." 
Wright & Miller, supra. Here, the government has been on notice of the elements it needs to 
prove since July 2020. It advised the Court it would be able to provide Rule 404(b) notice back 
in May 2021. Dkt. 229 at 3. With the trial continuance, it gained an additional five months. See 
Dkt. 297. 
There is no acceptable excuse for failure to follow the requirements of the Rule. Given 
the significant number of other pre-trial filing deadlines, briefing the admissibility of the 
proffered Rule 404(b) evidence in the midst of her other obligations will be exceptionally 
difficult. If the Court is inclined to grant the government additional time to satisfy the Rule, Ms. 
Maxwell requests ample time to investigate the materials and to respond. 
III. Ms. Maxwell Needs Additional Time to Respond to the Scant Notice that the 
Materials Qualify as "Direct Evidence" in the Case 
The Rule 404(b) Letter also repeated the Government's opinion that the newly-disclosed 
materials qualify as "direct evidence" of the conspiracy. At first blush, it is hard to see how they 
could so qualify. The emails referenced in the Letter purport to be between Ms. Maxwell and 
two adult men, apparently arranging dates for them, with adult women, sometime in the early 
2000s. They do not reference or have anything to do with (a) the persons mentioned in the 
Indictment or any other testifying witness, nor (b) any of the legal allegations contained in the 
EFTA00016214
--- PAGE 10 ---
Indictment. It is hard to imagine how an adult women fixing up single adult males with adult 
females is "direct evidence" of a conspiracy to transport, entice or traffic minors for sexual 
abuse. 
As to the witness referenced in the Letter, the Letter makes clear that the witness worked 
for Mr. Epstein from 2005-06, after the conclusion of the charged conspiracy in 2004. Given the 
timing of her stated employment, it also begs the question how her testimony, reference to 
unspecified documents or scheduling of unspecified massages, "among other things," could be 
direct evidence of a conspiracy that ended a year earlier. 
But because Ms. Maxwell has had insufficient time to investigate these newly-disclosed 
materials, she is unable to file a motion challenging their admissibility at this time. The emails 
involve two persons not interviewed by the Government, so there is no interview memo to 
corroborate their content. At least two of the potential witnesses are foreign nationals who live 
abroad. Ms. Maxwell will need time to contact and interview them. As to the newly disclosed 
witness, the Government produced on October 12, 2021 approximately 400 pages of interview 
reports, notes, documents, and other materials related to that witness. Ms. Maxwell is unable to 
review, investigate, or rebut the admissibility of all of the referenced materials by the October 
18, 2021 due date for motions in limine, and requests an additional two weeks to file her brief 
addressing the proffered 404(b) evidence. 
CONCLUSION 
The Government has been on notice of the amendments to Rule 404(b) since at least 
January 25, 2021. See Dkt. 146 at 10.' The Government was prepared to disclose their Rule 
Indeed, the Government argued in their response to Ms. Maxwell's pretrial motions that certain evidence 
pertaining to Accuser-3 would be admissible under Rule 404(b); yet the deadline to provide Notice of an 
intent to offer that evidence at trial under the rule has come and gone. See Dkt. 204 at 165-169. Ms. 
Maxwell today moves separately to exclude the evidence pertaining to Accuser-3. 
EFTA00016215
--- PAGE 11 ---
404(b) Notice by May 28, a date that was extended to October 11 after the continuance of the 
trial. Dkt. 229 at 3. The failure to comply with the requirements of the Rule has deprived Ms. 
Maxwell of the opportunity to litigate the issues on the timetable set by the Court. There is thus 
no "good cause" for extending the Government's ability to do so. This Court should exclude any 
evidence the government seeks belatedly to offer pursuant to Rule 404(b), or, alternatively 
should the Court find good cause for the failure of notice, grant Ms. Maxwell additional time to 
respond. As far as admissibility of the evidence referenced in the Letter as "direct evidence" of 
the charged crimes, Ms. Maxwell seeks leave to file such a Motion within two weeks.

personal knowledge. The rest is from social media. A great deal of social media was taken away right after she 
became controversial. They scrubbed the internet . Epstein was her "BBB" Man of the Year in 2002. He paid her 
$150,000 through two shell entities for her girls. We do not know the ages of the various women. We did not 
become familiar with the women. We ask for confidentiality for Madeleine. Madeleine , who is an opera singer, 
once sang for a BBB function. Enough social media, however, remains, and seems useful. We do not know all 
the sordid details, but we were never aware of any rules or age restrictions she imposed. I guess our point in 
contacting you was because we assumed that she is a person of interest and we know that she slipped into the US

Stockholm.Sincerely, John Ray ps, we are sending along various photos of BBB girls , always teamed up with

Gloria, 
We were wondering if you or your colleagues have been able to reach any of the clients we discussed last week? It would 
be very helpful to know their views and reactions shortly — and we're of course happy to speak with them directly as well 
if that would be helpful.

Thank you for having that discussion, and for drafting (hilarious — though ultimately probably helpful — that she wanted 
you to draft their views rather than just sending us a paragraph). My only thought is that given the change in our views of 
obstructive conduct (particularly with respect to destruction of materials) since they reviewed the Update Memo, 
would it be more straightforward to highlight just the large number of underage victims (and not the more outdated 
obstruction elements, as presumably many trafficking victims in other cases also conceal the schemes from police, and we 
don't ordinarily charge them)? Other than that, no additional thoughts, and thanks again.

I spoke with =. 
Bottom line, she thinks it's a close call between making 
take a felony plea and declining to 
prosecute, but she ultimately comes down in favor of a felony plea. She does not think we should charge 
with sex 
trafficking. 
asked me to send her and I= a draft of the summary of their views that we plan to send up to the brass. Below is 
what I'd propose: 
Our Office's Human Trafficking Coordinators have reviewed the prosecution team's Update Memo as well as 
submission, and are aware of the details of the Epstein investigation. In the Coordinators' experience, our Office 
ordinarily would decline to prosecute a victim-participant like 
absent certain aggravating factors, such as the use of 
violence by the victim-participant on others, or the victim-perpetrator continuing to run a sex trafficking operation in the 
absence of her abuser. Because those aggravating factors are not present here, the Coordinators believe it is a very close 
call between declining to prosecute 
and requiring 
to enter a felony plea. Ultimately, though, the 
Coordinators support a felony plea disposition along the lines set forth in 
submission given the unique 
circumstances of her case. In particular, the Coordinators believe that the large number of underage victims, together 
with 
obstructive conduct, warrant a felony plea. The Coordinators support such a disposition, in part, because a 
plea will allow victims to gain a sense of closure and to have their voices heard at sentencing if they choose. Given the 
mitigating factors presented in 
submission—most notably the sexual abuse she suffered at Epstein's hands—the 
Coordinators do not believe that our Office should charge 
with sex trafficking. 
What do you think?

Dear Counsel:

Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell through counsel, submit the following summary pursuant 
to Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(b)(1)(C). 
I. EXPERT DISCLOSURE BY THE DEFENSE 
A. Dr. Elizabeth Loftus 
Dr. Loftus is the Distinguished Professor of Psychological Science and Law at the 
University of California, Irvine School of Law. Dr. Loftus is one of the nation's leading experts 
on the science of memory. In addition to her experience as an academic and clinical researcher, 
she has been an expert witness or consultant in hundreds of cases. Her extensive experience and 
credentials are recited in her curriculum vitae. Exhibit A. 
It is expected that Dr. Loftus, a psychologist who specializes in the study of memory, will 
focus on the memory aspects of this case. Based on her education, training, experience, and 
research, her testimony will concern the workings of human memory, the effects of suggestion 
on memory, the mechanism of creation of false memories, the characteristics of false memories, 
how memory fades and weakens over time, and how memory becomes more vulnerable to 
contamination. She will describe scientific research showing that false memories can be 
EFTA00016268
--- PAGE 2 ---
November 1, 2021 
Page 2 
described with confidence, detail, and emotion, just like true memories. This can occur when 
people come to believe in these experiences and are not deliberately lying. Dr. Loftus would 
identify some of the suggestive activities that occurred in the current case. 
Suggestive activities can explain how it is that a person might go from having no memory 
of sexual abuse, and even denying sexual abuse, to later having "memories" for numerous 
abusive acts, if the memories are false. She will explain the mechanism by which false and/or 
distorted memories can be created as a result of post-event information and occurrences, 
suggestion, influence or the like. She will also testify about the characteristics of false and/or 
distorted memories. In particular "memories" can be described with confidence, detail and 
emotion, even when they are false. She will point out some of the suggestive activities that 
occurred in this case. She will explain how media coverage and other publications (including but 
not limited to newspaper and magazine articles, news reports, television shows, documentaries, 
books, podcasts, websites, etc.) and discussions/ conversations with others, can be sources of 
suggestion. She will explain how, in a case like this one, suggestion can lead individuals to the 
construction of distorted memories. 
B. Park Dietz, M.D., M.P.H., PH.D. 
Dr. Park Dietz is a psychiatrist specializing in forensic psychiatry with over 40 years of 
experience. He has been previously qualified as an expert in psychiatry and forensic psychiatry. 
Dr. Dietz received a bachelor's degree in psychology and biology from the Cornell

on forensic psychiatry. 
He has conducted more than 1,000 evaluations of persons charged with crime and, in his 
role as President of Park Dietz & Associates, Inc., has evaluated or supervised over 1,000 
evaluations of allegations of sexual victimization. He has testified as an expert witness in 
forensic psychiatry on hundreds of occasions, including testimony in criminal matters in federal 
courts throughout the U.S. and the trial courts of nearly every state. 
Dr. Dietz will be qualified as an expert in the areas of psychiatry and behavioral science. 
Dr. Dietz's curriculum vitae is attached as Exhibit B. Attached as Exhibit C is a list of material 
reviewed by Dr. Dietz. 
His testimony may include, but will not be limited to, the following: 
a. Opinions about Dr. Rocchio's Disclosed Opinions 
The first use of the word "grooming" to refer to strategies that sometimes enable 
nonforceful, nonthreatening, and nonviolent sexual victimization of minors was the proposition 
that "the perpetrator involves children in sexual abuse through a grooming process in which a 
combination of kindness, attention, material enticement, special privilege, and coercion are 
expertly applied" (Conte, 1984, p. 558). Since then, this usage has been widely adopted by 
social scientists, clinicians, journalists, and others. But this usage has some unintended 
consequences that threaten the integrity of the adjudicative process, including these: 
(1) Because use of the term "grooming" commonly assumes that the grooming party is 
intentionally using these strategies to gain sexual access to children, to abuse them, and to 
prevent them from disclosing the abuse, the word "grooming" has acquired meaning 
beyond an objective description of behaviors; it imputes motive and intent without 
adequate evidence of either. 
(2) In the litigation context, "when `grooming' is applied to such common and desirable 
behaviors as being kind or attentive or helpful or caring, there is considerable risk of 
misleading the fact finder into believing that these latter behaviors are well established 
predictors of child sexual abuse," when they are not. Park Dietz, Grooming and 
Seduction, 33 J. Interpersonal Violence, 28, 31 (2018). Dr. Rocchio characterizes 
"grooming" as "a strategic pattern of behavior[] ... that can take a variety of forms and 
function to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and 
to build trust and attachment with their abuser." This vague opinion about "grooming" 
carries the risk of imputing motive and intent to the Defendant, when the determination 
of motive and intent is a task for the fact finder charged with determining the credibility 
of witnesses, the weight of the evidence, and the ultimate issues. Moreover, this opinion 
carries the risk of implying that innocuous and even desirable behaviors are associated 
with nefarious or criminal conduct. 
EFTA00016270

Moreover, grooming has no consistent definition, and concerns have been raised that 
"there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred or is occurring." Natalie 
Bennett & William O'Donohue, The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse, 23 J. Child 
Sexual Abuse 957, 974 (2014). 
In any particular population of alleged victims, patients, or plaintiffs—including those 
whom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—the determination of whether grooming has 
occurred is a subjective judgment hinging largely on the credibility of the individuals. Such 
judgments have no known error rate and cannot be tested, verified, or reproduced. 
Although the Government's Expert Notice regarding Dr. Rocchio's proposed testimony 
is silent as to whether she is expected to impute a theory of "grooming-by-proxy" to the 
Defendant, it is important to note that there is no generally accepted theory of grooming by third 
parties or empirical evidence regarding the prevalence, characteristics, or mechanisms of such a 
phenomenon. Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or enticing sexualized massages for 
herself. Instead, the claim appears to be that Ms. Maxwell recruited and groomed minors to 
provide sexualized massages for Mr. Epstein, which would amount to grooming-by-proxy. 
Dr. Dietz is aware of no authority—no journal articles, no studies, no tests, nothing—to 
support a theory of grooming-by-proxy. Such a theory has not gained any acceptance (let alone 
general acceptance) in the relevant community; it has not been peer-reviewed; it has not and 
cannot be tested; and there is no known or potential rate of error. 
Dr. Rocchio's opinion that "[i]ndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted 
by perpetrators of sexual abuse" is a commonly accepted bit of clinical lore derived from the 
frequent observation of highly vulnerable children among those children who allege sexual 
abuse, but it is not based on empirical data regarding the likelihood of abuse among children 
with varying degrees of vulnerability. To the extent that less vulnerable children, such as those 
with intact families, attentive parents, good social support, little psychopathology, less prior 
trauma, no substance use, and higher resilience are less likely to allege abuse than the more 
vulnerable, the generalization could be proved weak or false, if only there were such empirical 
data. And even if there were such data, it would be important to devise a means of verifying that 
abuse did occur to those who allege it, which is a difficult task at best because of the pains so 
many abusers take to avoid confession, witnesses, or physical evidence. The clinical, criminal 
justice, and forensic populations from which the observation of prevalent vulnerabilities is 
derived—including those clients whom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—rarely represent 
groups in which all allegations of abuse have been verified by confession, witnesses, physical 
evidence, or other means. 
Other opinions put forth in the disclosure of Dr. Rocchio's proposed testimony also rest 
on assertions that are untestable, cannot be reproduced, and have no known error rate. 
b. Opinions About Hindsight Bias 
Hindsight bias must be considered when evaluating sex abuse allegations and or 
"grooming behavior." Many claims of sexual abuse of minors involve behaviors that are, in 
EFTA00016271
--- PAGE 5 ---
November 1, 2021 
Page 5 
hindsight, labeled "grooming" or otherwise imputed as knowledge to onlookers. Hindsight bias 
refers to the tendency to overestimate how predictable or foreseeable an event is after being 
informed about the outcome of an event. Simply put, knowledge of the outcome of the event, i.e. 
Epstein pleaded guilty to having sexual contact with post-pubescent minors, makes the 
importance of pre-conviction behaviors obvious. Retrospective judgments about the 
predictability or foreseeability of the outcome are systemically inflated or biased compared to 
judgments made without information about the outcome. Hindsight bias refers to the tendency to 
overestimate how predictable an event is after learning the outcome of the event (Fischhoff, 
1975). For example, after a political election, people believe their pre-election estimates of the 
outcome were closer to the outcome than they actually were (Blank, Fischer, & Erdfelder, 2003). 
Hindsight bias has been discussed in over 800 scholarly articles across a variety of different 
domains including medicine, financial decision making, consumer satisfaction, and within the 
legal domain (see Roese & Vohs, 2012; Arkes, 2013; Strohmaier et al., 2021) and using a variety 
of different experimental designs (Pohl & Erdfelder, 2016) and a variety of different stimuli such 
as written vignettes, visual stimuli (e.g., Bernstein & Harley, 2007), and auditory stimuli (e.g., 
Bernstein, Wilson, Pernat, & Meilleur, 2012). Even individuals with specialized training and 
expertise succumb to hindsight bias (Musch & Wagner, 2007). One notable study detected 
hindsight bias among actual judges making civil liability decisions, in which judges with 
outcome knowledge perceived the harm to be significantly more foreseeable than judges who did 
not receive outcome information and were thus more likely to render a finding of negligence 
(Oeberst & Goeckenjan, 2016). Another notable study detected hindsight bias in a sample of 
mental health professionals who gauged the dangerousness of a psychiatric patient; again, 
outcome knowledge affected the reported dangerousness and predictably of harm posed by the 
patient (Beltrani et al., 2018). 
Hindsight bias affects legal judgments. Civil or criminal prosecutions related to events 
occurring decades ago may be compromised by this bias in many ways, from the investigation—
either ignoring evidence or attributing significance in hindsight—through the presentation of 
evidence, to the deliberation of any factfinder. Awareness of the impact of the hindsight bias 
should temper any claims that so called "grooming" behaviors should have been noticed and 
either reported or avoided and that failing to do so constitutes knowledge or intent. 
c. Opinions Related to the Halo Effect 
The term "Halo effect" was coined by Thomdike (1920) a century ago. The Halo effect is 
a cognitive bias in impression formation whereby the positive evaluation of one characteristic 
has a radiating effect on how other, non-related characteristics of the individual are evaluated. 
For example, one classic study found that physical attractiveness influenced evaluations of the 
target's personality, life satisfaction, and expected future personal and occupational success —
despite the fact that no information about any of these attributes was provided (Dion et al., 
1972). Physical attractiveness has also been found to influence culpability judgments, with 
attractive individuals being held less-responsible than unattractive individuals (Dion, 1972; 
Efran, 1974). Halo effects have been found to be cued by factors other than attractiveness, such 
as the described status of the target (Wilson, 1968), the name of the target (Harari & McDavid, 
1973), and even one's mood when evaluating the target (Forgas, 2011). Studies have documented 
EFTA00016272
--- PAGE 6 ---
November 1, 2021 
Page 6 
halo effects when making diagnoses of psychopathology, such that symptoms of one mental 
disorder influence the interpretation of other symptoms indicative of other mental disorders and 
vice versa (see e.g., DeVries, Hartung, & Golden, 2017). 
Halo effects are a means to achieving cognitive consistency, which roughly refers to a 
state in which attitudes, perceptions, beliefs, predictions, and thoughts are aligned. Cognitive 
consistency serves many important goals. As noted by Read and Simon (2012), cognitive 
consistency is "essential for reasons of parsimony and economy of effort, as well as to allow for 
the predictability of, and hence adaptability to, subsequent encounters" (p. 67). Indeed, the noted 
psychologist Leon Festinger "was convinced that the psychological need for cognitive 
consistency is as basic as hunger and thirst" (Gawronski, 2012, p. 652). But because the world is 
often not so neat, orderly, or unequivocal, humans engage in complicated reasoning processes to 
impose consistency. These processes involve bi-directional reasoning in which "decisions follow 
from evidence, and evaluations of the evidence shift toward coherence with the emerging 
decision" (Simon, Snow, & Read, 2004, p. 814; Greenspan & Scurich, 2016). As a result, 
perceptions and decisions become highly skewed toward one interpretation while alternatives are 
neglected or dismissed, hence consistency is achieved. This reasoning process occurs 
unconsciously, i.e., outside conscious awareness, and is not intentional self-deception. 
Halo effects can have serious practical consequences. As noted by Forgas and Laham 
(2016): 
Once unjustified initial expectations are formed about a person, they can 
easily become self-perpetuating with serious implications for how a target is 
treated. If we expect a person to have positive characteristics, we may 
selectively look for and find such features from the rich array of information 
available (a self-fulfilling prophecy), and positive impressions may in turn 
lead to preferential treatment in a range of domains: 
interpersonal relations, the work place, the health and legal systems, and even 
for decision making and consumer choices. (p. 286) 
Like many people who achieve great power and wealth, Jeffery Epstein exploited the Halo effect 
to surround himself with people who would serve his needs. At the most primitive level, his 
wealth attracted those seeking for themselves some of what he had. At the most sophisticated 
level, others with halos of their own—through any combination of power, influence, fame, 
brilliance, attractiveness, social standing, or other positive characteristics—mingled with Epstein 
for reasons of their own, and being seen in their company empowered him and made him look 
above suspicion. In a videotaped interview with Steve Bannon, Epstein differentiated between 
different kinds of power—such as Bill Clinton's political power, wrestlers' and weight lifters' 
physical power, and Gerry Edelman's intellectual power—and acknowledged that he gravitated 
to people of power. [CONFIDENTIAL] SDNY_GM_SUPP_00219000.mov. 
The materials reviewed reflect that Jeffrey Epstein was a brilliant man who was flawed 
by enduring personality traits familiar to psychiatrists as "Cluster B personality traits," found 
among those with antisocial, narcissistic, borderline, and histrionic personality disorders.

American Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th 
Ed., Arlington, VA: American Psychiatric Association (2013), pp. 659-672. These flaws 
allowed him to use his brilliance to manipulate people to do his bidding and to compartmentalize 
people into isolated cells in which none had complete information about his activities. These 
were not his only flaws, and Dr. Dietz is also prepared to address Jeffrey Epstein's sexual 
behavior should it prove relevant. 
d. Opinions Related to the Multiple Pathways to False Sex Assault 
Allegations 
Studies concerning the accurate reporting of alleged sexual assaults undermine the 
assertions made by Dr. Rocchio to the extent they are based on uncorroborated allegations and 
are also otherwise relevant here. False allegations of sexual assault do occur, and there are 
multiple pathways to these false allegations of sexual assault. 
Not all allegations of sexual assault are true. Unfortunately, there has been little work on 
understanding the prevalence of false allegations or pathways to these, particularly in a sample 
most relevant to a jury—currently adjudicated cases. A peer reviewed journal article has 
proposed 11 pathways to false allegations of sexual assault: (a) lying, (b) implied consent, (c) 
false memories, (d) intoxication, (e) antisocial personality disorder, (f) borderline personality 
disorder, (g) histrionic personality disorder, (h) delirium, (i) psychotic disorders, (j) dissociation, 
and (k) intellectual disability. Jessica Engle and William O'Donohue, Pathways to False 
Allegations of Sexual Assault, 12 J. Forensic Psychology Practice, 97. These pathways originate 
in the psychological proclivities or state of the individual making these false allegations. The 
descriptions of these pathways that follow include material drawn nearly verbatim from the 
article by Engle and O'Donohue (2012), which was published before the latest edition of the 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders but nonetheless remains accurate in 
characterizing certain personality disorders. 
Ly_int : Lying involves the alleged victim knowingly making a false claim of sexual 
assault. Humans do lie, and their lies can be difficult to detect. Often, humans lie because of 
what they perceive as the favorable consequences for lying; for sexual assault these 
consequences could be: 
• I. the severe negative consequences that the alleged perpetrator experiences, 
• 2. secondary gain from victim status, 
• 3. excusing behaviors or characteristics of the alleged victim (e.g., sexual 
activity, pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases) 
• 4. financial gain. 
Implied Consent: A fact finder's determination of whether consent was competently 
given is often problematic, and some allegations are regarded as unfounded or false based on 
determinations regarding consent before cases reach the stage of adjudication. A false allegation 
EFTA00016274
--- PAGE 8 ---
November 1, 2021 
Page 8 
can arise when it was reasonable to believe consent was given but the alleged victim falsely 
believes that it was not. 
False Memory: The existence and prevalence of repressed memories is a source of 
controversy, and yet research does exist demonstrating the successful implantation of fabricated 
memories. In one of the first studies on the implantation of false memories, participants were 
given short narratives of childhood experiences, purportedly obtained from relatives, and asked 
to try to remember these experiences. Research by Elizabeth Loftus has revealed how subtle 
information introduced after an event may alter the memory of that event. Loftus and her 
students have conducted more than 200 studies with more than 20,000 participants 
demonstrating how misinformation introduced after an event can induce people into creating 
false memories. 
Intoxication: Intoxication can substantially increase the likelihood of a false allegation of 
sexual assault. Alcohol and other intoxicants pose a significant problem in sorting out the 
validity of a sexual assault allegation. The information-processing errors induced by intoxicating 
substances may cause confusion surrounding events that occurred while a person was 
intoxicated. A person who does not accurately recall events that occurred while he or she was 
under the influence or while experiencing the side effects of withdrawal from a substance may 
attempt to make sense out of the disjointed and seemingly incoherent memories of events that 
occurred while intoxicated. In an effort to make sense of and organize what memories are intact, 
a person may confabulate or fill in the memory lapses with events that seem probable or which 
for some reason they come to believe "must have" taken place. 
Antisocial Personality Disorder: The essential feature of antisocial personality disorder is 
a pervasive pattern of behavior that disregards and violates of the rights of others. It often begins 
in early childhood or early adolescence and continues into adulthood. If an individual with 
antisocial personality disorder is likely to lie to achieve power and pleasure, a false allegation of 
sexual assault might be the means by which he or she attempts to achieve power over the falsely 
accused. Falsely claiming someone sexually assaulted you can be an aggressive act and a lack of 
remorse could allow the individual to file an allegation of sexual assault and maintain this 
allegation with few, if any, conflicts of conscience. Thus, a pathway to a false allegation of 
sexual assault can occur when an individual with antisocial personality disorder makes a false 
claim of assault. 
Borderline Personality Disorder: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious 
mental condition characterized by affective dysregulation, impulsiveness, difficulties in 
interpersonal relationships, and difficulties with self-image. Of particular note is the rapid 
switching from idealization to devaluation, impulsivity, and manipulative features of borderline 
personality disorder. The instability of relationships experienced by an individual with BPD may 
be rooted in the tendency to quickly switch from idealizing significant others or lovers to 
devaluing them. This sudden change in conceptualization of a partner is often caused by feeling 
that the partner is not caring enough or giving enough or by suspicion of abandonment. The rapid 
shifting between idealizing and demonization may bring about a change in perspective such that 
a relationship that was viewed idealistically in the past is now seen through the devalued lens of 
abuse or mistreatment. Past events then may become construed as "abuse" and may lead a person 
EFTA00016275
--- PAGE 9 ---
November 1, 2021 
Page 9 
with BPD to believe he or she is a victim of sexual assault. Previous research has found that two 
of the three major motivations to file a false allegation of rape were attention-seeking and 
revenge. The switch from idealization to devaluation of the relationship and/or relationship 
partner may spur a desire for revenge for any past behaviors that are, in the devaluation phase, 
newly construed as mistreatment. Also, there is some evidence that individuals with BPD engage 
in behaviors that are viewed as "manipulative." Manipulative behaviors are often outside the 
conscious awareness of the individual and are learned through positive reinforcement, as 
manipulation frequently results in positive outcomes for the manipulator. Thus, an individual 
with BPD may use a sexual assault allegation as a way of impacting a third party for some 
desired outcome. 
Histrionic Personality Disorder: Diagnostic criteria for histrionic personality disorder 
include: 1) feeling uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of attention; 2) 
interactions with others are often characterized by inappropriate sexually seductive or 
provocative behavior; 3) displaying rapidly shifting and shallow expressions; 4) consistently uses 
physical appearance to draw attention to the self; 5) has a style of speech that is excessively 
impressionistic and lacking in detail; 6) shows self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated 
expression of emotion; 7) is suggestible (i.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances), and 
8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are. Other relevant behaviors 
include the tendency to play out stereotyped roles in their relationships with others; an intense 
desire for novelty and excitement; and the upset and depression that may follow periods in which 
they received little attention. Filing a false allegation of sexual assault may serve to benefit 
individuals with histrionic personality disorder in several important ways. The sexualized 
behavior of individuals with histrionic personality disorder can lead to sexual relationships that 
may be used to seek attention (e.g., having sex with a person and telling all of their friends about 
it). Filing a false sexual assault claim may regain lost attention, either from the desired partner or 
from other individuals, providing a novel and exciting environment that may be stimulating to a 
person who is histrionic. They may enjoy the large amounts of attention received for filing a 
sexual assault charge and for the "victim" role that can be played out in other relationships (a 
dynamic also common in false allegations by those with borderline personality disorder). In 
times when attention is not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual assault 
may help to pull individuals with histrionic personality disorder out of their depressed state. 
Delirium: Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness that is accompanied by a change in 
cognition that cannot be better accounted for by a preexisting or evolving dementia. Relevant to 
this pathway are the perceptual disturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations, 
illusions, or even hallucinations. Many substances induce delirium, particularly in excessive 
doses. 
Psychotic Disorders: The term psychotic generally refers to conditions that are marked by 
delusions, hallucinations, or markedly illogical thinking. Such conditions cause gross 
impairments in functioning. Studies investigating the content of delusions have found delusions 
that are sexual in nature are not uncommon and occur more often in women than in men. Some 
cases of sexual delusions have been documented. These delusions may lead a person to claim 
adamantly that sexual relations or events occurred that may be impossible or highly improbable.

Dissociation: Dissociation is `the lack of the normal integration of thoughts, feelings, 
and experiences into the stream of consciousness and memory. Dissociation involves a 
disruption or splitting off of memory, personality, identity, consciousness, or general perceptions 
of the self and surroundings; it can be recurring, gradual, or transient. It is likely associated with 
memory distortions. Thus, it is possible that in the event of a sexual assault, dissociation may 
cause a person to fill in the parts of the experience that are not clearly remembered with events 
that for them feasibly could have occurred. Of course, memory lapses will not necessarily be 
filled in with a confabulated event, let alone a sexual one. However, individuals who dissociate 
at a high frequency may seek to make their stories more coherent by adding details to an 
incomplete memory that would make sense to them when considered in the context of the event. 
Thus, these confabulations may lead to erroneous claims that have forensic relevance, including 
who the perpetrator was, what happened, where, and how many times. 
Intellectual Disability: Intellectual disability, is characterized by below average IQ and 
adaptive functioning. Limitations in functioning include deficits in the acquisition of social, 
occupational, academic, and general self-care skills. Intellectual disability has several etiologies 
that often are related to biological or pathological processes affecting the central nervous system. 
Many of the specific vulnerabilities that arise from intellectual disability overlap to some extent 
with other disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome) and 
individuals with other developmental disabilities may also have intellectual disability. 
Intellectually disabled individuals, compared to individuals without ID, have vulnerabilities 
related to memory and communication that the legal system may not be equipped to handle 
adequately. Individuals with moderate-to-profound ID may have significant difficulty 
communicating about the events that occurred because of language skills deficits or other 
communication-interfering conditions (e.g., related neurological conditions). Research findings 
indicate that communications skills are essential in filing a sexual assault charge; alleged victims 
with mild ID were more likely than individuals with moderate or severe ID not only to file 
sexual assault charges but to have their allegations confirmed. Difficulties with memory may 
also complicate the investigation process for individuals with ID. 
Changes in the core details of the allegation are often used by professionals as indices in 
determining the credibility of a victim's claims. Peace and colleagues (2015) conducted a 
narrative analysis of 147 sets of allegations of sexual assault across short (3 month) and long (6 
month) intervals since the alleged event took place. In reviewing the existing literature, Peace 
and colleagues found that genuine traumatic experiences have a demonstrable resiliency to 
drastic impairments in recall. However, some inconsistencies especially in less core matters are 
to be expected due to some less important details fading or varying over time. In examining their 
sample of 147 allegations, the researchers discovered that truthful allegations contained more 
detail relative to false allegations at each of the assessment intervals. Specifically, the researchers 
found that fabricated allegations of traumatic experiences contained more inconsistent details 
both at 3 months and 6 months. The total amount of detail for each type of allegation (true or 
false) does tend to decrease over time. Additionally, as these figures suggest, the researchers 
found that the number of details present in genuine reports continued to decrease over time 
whereas fabricated stories `levelled off' in detail.

Hunt and Bull (2012) reviewed signs that can be used to differentiate true allegations of 
sexual assault from false ones and concluded that the literature did not support the hypothesis 
that emotional distress was predictive of the truthfulness of the allegation. This is consistent 
across the literature, and emotional distress (e.g., crying) is not regarded as a reliable predictor of 
the accuracy or truthfulness of an allegation. Additional research is needed, but at this point there 
is little empirical support to indicate that being emotionally upset, distressed, or crying while 
reporting an assault indicates that the report is more likely to be true. This is likely due to the fact 
that such reactions can also occur in false allegations for various reasons, including a false 
memory or an attempt to mislead by those who know this sort of reaction would be expected of a 
true allegation. 
Individuals who have been sexually assaulted have higher rates of mental disorders than 
individuals who have not been sexually assaulted, and this includes significantly higher rates of 
post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, bipolar disorder, drug use disorders, and alcohol use 
disorders. Emily R. Dworkin, Risk for Mental Disorders Associated with Sexual Assault: A 
Meta-Analysis, 21 Trauma, Violence, & Abuse (2020), pp. 1011-1028. Any of these mental 
disorders that occur more frequently among those who have been sexually assaulted can affect 
memory and recall, requiring assessment on a case-by-case basis. 
Varying degrees of post-traumatic stress symptomatology occur in significant proportions 
of victims following sexual assault and last for varying durations. Emily R. Dworkin, Anna E. 
Jaffe, Michele Bedard-Gilligan, and Skye Fitzpatrick, PTSD in the Year Following Sexual 
Assault: A Meta-Analysis of Prospective Studies, Trauma, Violence, & Abuse (2021) 
https://doi.org/I0.1177/15248380211032213. A substantial number of people never fully remit 
from their PTSD even after many years, and variables associated with a longer time to remit 
from an episode of chronic PTSD include a history of alcohol abuse and a history of childhood 
trauma. Caron Zlotnick, Meredith Warshaw, et al., Chronicity in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder 
(PTSD) and Predictors of Course of Comorbid PTSD in Patients with Anxiety Disorders,12 J. 
Traumatic Stress (1999), 89-100. 
Symptoms of PTSD include distressing memories of the event; intense or prolonged 
psychological distress at exposure to cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic 
event; marked physiological reactions to cues that symbolize or resemble an aspect of the 
traumatic event; avoidance or efforts to avoid distressing memories, thoughts, or feelings about 
or closely associated with the traumatic event(s); and avoidance of or efforts to avoid external 
reminders (people, places, conversations, activities, objects, situations) that arouse distressing 
memories, thoughts, or feelings about or closely associated with the traumatic event(s). 
American Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th 
Ed., Arlington, VA: American Psychiatric Association (2013), pp. 271-272. Individuals with 
any of these symptoms are particularly unlikely to engage in continued communication or 
friendly gestures with an alleged perpetrator, to wear clothing provided by an alleged perpetrator, 
or to unnecessarily recreate a sexual assault event, any of which would be expected to elicit 
intense distress.

Re: 
Doe v. Indyke, et al., 1:20-cv-000484-JGK-DCF 
Plaintiff's Opposition Letter to Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell's Letter Motion 
to Stay Proceedings 
Dear Judge Freeman: 
On behalf of plaintiff Jane Doe in the above-referenced litigation, we hereby submit this 
opposition to defendant Ghislaine Maxwell's Motion to Stay. 
INTRODUCTION 
On August 19, 2020, defendant Maxwell wrote to this Court requesting that it stay this 
case until the conclusion of her pending criminal case in which she is accused of recruiting and 
enticing minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts. The trial in that case is not currently 
scheduled to commence until July of 2021. 
Defendant Maxwell's leading argument in support of her request is that she is unable to 
defend herself in this case while she is in jail and awaiting trial in the criminal case. Prior to 
filing her request to halt these proceedings, however, defendant Maxwell, through her counsel, 
filed her answer to Plaintiffs complaint over one month ago, participated in a case management 
conference with the Court on August 5 and has engaged in numerous email exchanges and phone 
calls with the other parties concerning setting depositions and case deadlines. Moreover, even 
after asking the Court to stay this case on August 19 because it would purportedly be a "burden" 
on her to defend this case under her current circumstances, defendant Maxwell propounded 
discovery on Plaintiff just two days later on August 21 seeking a wide variety of information and 
documents from her. Defendant Maxwell's thinly veiled argument that her criminal case is 
somehow preventing her from doing what she needs or wants to do in this case is undermined by 
the record of what has actually occurred. Rather, defendant Maxwell appears to want to gain an 
unfair advantage by acquiring as much information as she can about Plaintiff without having to 
divulge anything about herself or the bad conduct she is alleged to have committed.

SHEA & 
BOYLE 
LLP 
Defendant Maxwell's other main argument is that Plaintiff is somehow doing something 
foolish or inappropriate by not staying her case in order to "pursue a civil remedy in the Epstein 
Claims Resolution Program." She argues that Plaintiff is "inexplicably the only of the numerous 
Epstein plaintiffs in this Court to not agree to such a stay" and that "a stay also would permit 
[Plaintiff] the opportunity to [participate in the Epstein victim claims program]." Defendant 
Maxwell then falsely claims that "Plaintiff has not advanced a cogent reason for wanting to press 
ahead alone." Not so. Plaintiff is seeking to hold defendant Maxwell accountable for the 
heinous and sick sexual acts she committed against Plaintiff over the course of several years 
while Plaintiff was just a child. Pausing this lawsuit for approximately one year or more, as 
defendant Maxwell is requesting, would in no way help Plaintiff accomplish that objective 
despite defendant Maxwell's self-serving arguments to the contrary. Instead, it would simply 
delay long overdue justice for Plaintiff. 
Moreover, while defendant Maxwell would have this Court and the public believe that 
Plaintiff has to choose between pursuing her claims in this case or participating in the Epstein 
victim claims program, nothing could be further from the truth. Indeed, the protocol for the 
claims program explicitly states that: "Individuals who have filed a lawsuit need not agree to a 
stay of litigation or make any other concession in any pending litigation to be eligible to 
participate in the Program." Despite this straightforward and sensible provision in the claims 
program protocol, defendant Maxwell has underhandedly attempted to persuade the Court that 
should a stay be entered it would "permit" Plaintiff to participate in the claims program. Plaintiff 
does not—and should not—have to choose between her civil lawsuit and participating in the 
claims program. And the last thing Plaintiff needs is for Ghislaine Maxwell to pretend that by 
putting a stop to this case she would somehow benefit by being "permitted" to participate in the 
claims program. Plaintiff does not need permission by defendant Maxwell or anyone else to 
exercise her legal rights. 
Defendant Maxwell's motion does not meet the high burden required by the law to justify 
an extraordinary remedy as a stay of proceedings in this case. For the reasons set forth above 
and those that follow, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court deny defendant Maxwell's 
request to stay this case. If, however, the Court is inclined to grant a stay at all, Plaintiff submits 
that it should be as to the entire action and not just as to discovery directed to defendant Maxwell 
as counsel pointed out was the case in Farmer v. Indyke, 19-cv-10475-LGS-DCF. Otherwise, 
defendant Maxwell would be given the unfair advantage of collecting evidence from others and 
taking part in the questioning of witnesses at depositions while at the same time silently hiding 
behind a court order blocking anyone from doing the same as to her.

LEGAL STANDARD 
itMgH 
SHEA & 
BOYLE, , 
A stay of a civil case to permit conclusion of a related criminal prosecution has been 
characterized as an "extraordinary remedy." Louis Vuitton Malletier S.A. v. LY USA, Inc., 676 
F.3d 83, 98 (2d Cir. 2012) (emphasis added). As a result, a civil defendant urging a stay pending 
a parallel criminal prosecution bears the burden of establishing its need. Rex & Roberta Ling 
Living Tr v. B Commc'ns Ltd., 346 F. Supp. 3d 389, 400 (S.D.N.Y. 2018). "[A]bsent a showing 
of undue prejudice upon defendant or interference with his constitutional rights, there is no 
reason why plaintiff should be delayed in its efforts to diligently proceed to sustain its claim." 
Id. at 97. 
When determining whether a stay should be granted or denied, a court must undergo "a 
particularized inquiry into the circumstances of, and the competing interests in, the case." Louis 
Vuitton Malletier S.A., 676 F.3d at 99. Courts in this District conduct the particularized inquiry 
guided by the following six factors which are balanced when considering a stay: 1) the extent to 
which the issues in the criminal case overlap with those presented in the civil case; 2) the status 
of the case, including whether the defendants have been indicted; 3) the private interests of the 
plaintiffs in proceeding expeditiously weighed against the prejudice to plaintiffs caused by the 
delay; 4) the private interests of and burden on the defendants; 5) the interests of the courts; and 
6) the public interest. Id. at 99. 
Critically, the balancing of these factors "can do no more than act as a rough guide for the 
district court as it exercises its discretion." Id. These factors "do little more than serve as 
something of a check list of factors [the appellate court] ought to consider" when reviewing a 
lower courts determination. Ultimately, though, the court must rely on nothing more than its 
studied judgment "based on the particular facts before it and the extent to which such a stay 
would work a hardship, inequity, or injustice to a party, the public or the court." Id. 
A STAY OF ALL PROCEEDINGS HARMS PLAINTIFF'S INTERESTS 
Defendant Maxwell argues that a stay in the litigation benefits Plaintiff Not so. First, as 
discussed above, defendant Maxwell asserts that staying the litigation would "permit [Plaintiff] 
the opportunity" to participate in the Epstein victim claims program. Defendants Maxwell's 
implication is obvious: if Plaintiff continues to litigate, she cannot participate in the program. 
That is categorically false. Whether or not Plaintiff participates, the program explicitly states that 
a stay of any participant's civil proceedings is not required in order to participate. 
Defendant Maxwell also asserts that participation in the claims program will "obviat[e] 
the need for this case to proceed at all." Defendant Maxwell knows, however, that participation

in the claims program is not binding and that victims of Epstein and Maxwell are free to reject 
any offer made in the program in favor of pursuing damages through litigation. 
Lastly, defendant Maxwell callously suggests that because Plaintiffs abuse occurred 26 
years ago, there is "hardly much harm" in delaying Plaintiffs "stale" claims. The fact, however, 
that Epstein and Maxwell started to abuse Plaintiff when she was a 14-year-old girl-26 years 
ago—does not negate the ongoing damaging effects that abuse has had and continue to have on 
Plaintiff. 
Simply put, a stay would harm—not benefit—Plaintiffs interests. For too long Jeffrey 
Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell skirted the consequences of their vile acts. Now, Plaintiff brings 
this suit, as is her right by law, to hold the Epstein Estate and defendant Maxwell to answer. 
Plaintiff is best served by pressing forward with her claims—not waiting even longer for justice. 
Sadly, defendant Maxwell's seeking a stay is consistent with her decades-long routine of 
resisting accountability for sexually abusing minors. As a result, her request for a stay should be 
denied. 
CONTINUED CIVIL LITIGATION WILL NOT BURDEN MAXWELL WHO 
HAS ACTIVELY PARTICIPATED IN THE CASE FROM JAIL 
Next, defendant Maxwell argues the burden on the Defendant militates in favor of a stay. 
Defendants Maxwell states that the burden of proceeding with this litigation "cannot be 
overstated." However, a particularized inquiry into defendant Maxwell's complaints about the 
difficulty of proceeding with the civil case while incarcerated reveal a stark contradiction. 
Indeed, defendant Maxwell has already been actively participating in this litigation from jail for 
months. Here is a relevant timeline: 
On July 2, 2020, Ghislaine Maxwell was arrested while hiding out in New Hampshire. 
On July 9, 2020, from jail, defendant Maxwell filed an answer in this case. Since then, 
defendant Maxwell through her counsel has actively participated in the litigation, including 
scheduling depositions, conferring several times with counsel for Plaintiff and the Epstein Estate, 
and appearing before this Court. 
On August 19, 2020, from jail, defendant Maxwell filed this motion to stay proceedings. 
Despite complaining of the monstrous burden imposed by litigating from jail, two days later, on 
August 21, 2020, Maxwell served discovery requests on Plaintiff, including sixteen 
interrogatories and twenty-four requests for production of documents.

Clearly, defendant Maxwell wants to use her incarceration both as a shield and a sword: 
arguing that it is simply too much to litigate from jail, while at the same time, pressing ahead in 
her attempts to undermine Plaintiffs claims. Clearly, the burden on defendant Maxwell is not 
great. 
THE PUBLIC INTEREST IS BEST SERVED BY ALLOWING PLAINTIFF'S 
CLAIMS TO PROCEED 
In her motion, defendant Maxwell entirely fails to address why the public interest is 
served by a stay. That is because the public interest is not served by a stay; the public is best 
served by allowing Plaintiffs claims against defendant Maxwell—the only actively litigated 
claims against her currently—to proceed in full public view. 
Courts in the Second Circuit recognize that the public benefits from civil litigation not 
only when it advances the justifiable interests of the Plaintiff, but also when the litigation 
furnishes the public with information on the torts and crimes of a wrongdoer. See Louis Vuitton 
Malletier S.A., 676 F.3d at 103 (citing SEC v. Dresser Indus., 628 F.2d 1368, 1372 
(D.C.Cir.1980) (en banc) (denying a stay in order to avoid the continued dissemination of false 
or misleading information by companies to members of the investing public). In Louis Vuitton 
Malletier S.A., the Second Circuit upheld the denial of a criminal and civil defendant's request 
for a stay of the civil litigation in part because, to the public's benefit, the litigation uncovered 
evidence that the defendant was running a counterfeiting operation. See id. 
For years defendant Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein were at the center of a criminal 
enterprise geared towards sexually abusing minor girls and getting away with it. Plaintiffs 
lawsuit is the only case currently being litigated against her—all others have either been stayed 
or dismissed. While Plaintiff has much to gain through this litigation, so too does the public. 
The continuation of this last remaining civil avenue can furnish the public with critical 
information as to defendant Maxwell's well known criminal enterprise, how it was operated and 
all those involved. A stay of the civil proceedings would provide what defendant Maxwell has 
sought for years—concealing her heinous acts from public view. 
MAXWELL'S EXTRAORDINARY REOUEST FOR A STAY SHOULD NOT BE 
GRANTED SIMPLY BECAUSE SHE HAS BEEN INDICTED AND CLAIMS 
THERE IS OVERLAP BETWEEN THE INDICTMENT AND PLAINTIFF'S 
COMPLAINT 
Defendant Maxwell also argues that because of her indictment and an overlap between 
Plaintiffs complaint and the indictment, she is entitled to a stay. However, a defendant in both a

civil and criminal matter, like defendant Maxwell here, has "no absolute right not to be forced to 
choose between testifying in a civil matter and asserting [her] Fifth Amendment privilege." Louis 
Vuitton Malletier S.A., 676 F.3d at 98 (quoting Keating v. Office of Thrift Supervision, 45 F.3d 
322, 326 (9th Cir.1995)). In fact, "[t]he existence of a civil defendant's Fifth Amendment right 
arising out of a related criminal proceeding thus does not strip the court in the civil action of its 
broad discretion" to move the case along. See Louis Vuitton Malletier S.A., 676 F.3d at 98-99. 
Defendant Maxwell has no absolute right to stay this case simply because she has been 
indicted. Instead, the Court must conduct its own particularized inquiry into the facts at hand 
when deciding whether to grant her request. As she has demonstrated throughout this litigation, 
during which time she has been both indicted and incarcerated, defendant Maxwell is not unduly 
burdened by continued litigation. 
For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court deny defendant 
Maxwell's request to stay this case. 
Respectfully submitted,

Circling back / following up on the records issue, and adding 
to this chain, it looks like we have some version of the 
case file as it existed with the FOIA office in D.C. But when I last spoke with D.C., they said that they had only been able to 
transfer approximately 16,000 pages — out of 29,000 total — to 
an you remind what the latest is with D.C. in terms of figuring out what they actually transferred to 
? I can't 
tell from looking at the hard drive we have uploaded. I want to get it onto Relativity, but not if it's just a subset and we're 
still working on getting the whole file from them. 
I changed the file title slightly to reflect its contents — and some time when I can let the file transfer run overnight I'll put it 
as a subfolder in FBI materials, but for now it's here — 
\\ Usa.doj.gov\ clouaNYS StAndrews \Shared \ USvEpstein-2018R01618 \ Investigation 2019-03-06 case file from DC hard 
drive 
I also moved the folder of video discs we got into the 72 File folder, since those were all from that investigation (the black 
book sting). 
Was thinking of this just because I want to make sure any docs we're getting are put on Relativity for review — I'll do the 
same for the Boies docs, and it made me think of the D.C. stuff too since I think we may be a little stalled on that (unless 
what 
got was in fact the full 29,000 pages).

Thanks very much — if you could please give the DVDs to 
(cc'd here) for case file storage, that would be 
great. 
And on the work product, I think it probably would make sense to take a look before it all gets uploaded to Relativity —
what's the easiest way to do that? The entire team is unfortunately traveling from tomorrow through Friday, but we can 
talk / meet early next week if that's the most convenient.

Are you available for a call at 10 a.m. on Monday morning? We wanted to follow up on some of the information we've 
been emailing about. Below are the topics we'd like to discuss—if you're able to address these topics on the call, we'd 
very much appreciate it. 
• 
What current/active financial accounts are we are of for Maxwell, including credit card accounts? 
• 
What is the connection between Maxwell and UMB bank, and what did we expect to find when we issued the 
subpoena? 
• 
We issued a subpoena to Mon 9/25/19 (attached). SDNY does not have returns — have you received them? 
• 
When was the last time we ran a SAR/CTR check on Maxwell? Have there been any filings in the past year for her 
accounts?

I've been working to get all of the subpoena returns organized for this case. In going through the tracker of bank 
subpoenas and returns that you sent over on June 2nd, I was unable to find any corresponding returns on our shared 
drive. I understand that in the past you have been sending them over on discs but given the circumstances would you be 
able to also have them uploaded to USAfx?

M, 
I spoke with a representative from Amex in connection with the attached, and they said all Amex account 
numbers start with 37, but the Amex number you sent starts with 34. Do we have returns from that card 
currently, or is this an entirely new card request? 
No problem either way, but I wanted to check since you said the closing date of the last statement was 12/18/19 
so that made me think we might have some returns from that account already. Though looking at the returns we 
received from Amex previously, I don't see it. Please let us know? Thanks very much.

In re: Warrants and Orders For 
Prospective and Historical Location

and

the 
Cell hones 
Assigned Call Numbers 
and 
USAO Reference 
No. 2018R01618 
Application for Warrants and Orders 
for Cellphone Location and Pen Register Information 
APPLICATION 
Mag. 
The United States of America, by its attorney, Audrey Strauss, Acting United States 
Attorney for the Southern District of New York, 
Assistant United States 
Attorney, of counsel, respectfully requests that the Court issue the accompanying proposed 
Warrants and Orders for prospective and historical location information and pen register 
information for two cellphones. As grounds for this Application the Government relies on the 
following facts and authorities. 
I. Introduction 
I. I am an Assistant United States Attorney in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern 
District of New York. This Application is submitted in conjunction with the accompanying 
affidavit of a law enforcement agent ("Agent Affidavit"), to be sworn before this Court, and 
incorporated by reference herein. I make this Application based on information and belief, 
including the Agent Affidavit, my review of other documents in the case, and information received 
from investigative personnel. 
2. The Investigating Agency, Target Cellphones, Subscribers, Target Subject, Service 
Providers, Subject Offenses, Successor Service Provider, and Successor Cellphone referenced in 
this Application are as specified in the Agent Affidavit. 
2019.07.24 
EFTA00016349
--- PAGE 2 ---
II. Legal Authority 
A. Prospective Location Information 
3. The Government seeks to obtain both precision location information and cell site data 
for the Target Cellphones on a prospective basis (the "Prospective Location Information") for a 
period of 45 days from the date of this order — the same period of time for which a warrant for a 
tracking device may be granted under Rule 41(e)(2)(C). It bears noting, however, that while the 
Prospective Location Information may permit "tracking" the user of the phone in the colloquial 
sense, this is not an application for a warrant for a "tracking device" as defined in Fed. R. Crim. 
P. 41(a)(2)(E) and 18 U.S.C. § 3117(b). Those provisions only apply where an agent is seeking to 
physically install a tracking device on a given object. 
Instead, the Prospective Location 
Information will be obtained by requiring the Service Provider to provide the information. 
4. The authority for this application is found in 18 U.S.C. § 2703(c)(1), which authorizes 
a court of competent jurisdiction to require any electronic communication service provider (which 
includes a cellular telephone service provider') to disclose any "record or other information 
pertaining to a subscriber other than the "contents of communications," when the government 
obtains, inter cilia, a warrant under the applicable procedures of Rule 41. See 18 U.S.C. § 
2703(cX1)(A). Because data concerning a subscriber's location, such as precision location 
information and cell site data, constitutes "information pertaining to a subscribe?' that does not 
include the "contents of communications," that data is among the types of information available 
See 18 U.S.C. § 2711(1) (incorporating by cross-reference statutory definitions set forth in 18 
U.S.C. § 2510); 18 U.S.C. § 2510(15) (defining "electronic communication service" as "any 
service which provides to users thereof the ability to send or receive wire or electronic 
communications"). 
2019.07.24 
EFTA00016350
--- PAGE 3 ---
under § 2703(c)(1)(A).2 Further, as specified in 18 U.S.C. § 2711(3), this Court is a court of 
competent jurisdiction under the Stored Communications Act because it has jurisdiction over the 
Subject Offenses. 
5. The Government's request for cell site data also implicates the pen register statute, 
because such data constitutes signaling information used by the Service Providers to route 
communications to and from the Target Cellphones. In order to collect such data, a valid pen 
register order is required.3 Accordingly, I hereby certify pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3122 that such 
signaling information is relevant to an ongoing investigation being conducted by the Investigating 
Agency into suspected violations of the Subject Offenses by the Target Subject. 
B. Historical Location Information 
6. The Government also seeks historical cell site data for the Target Cellphones for the 
period from June I, 2020 to the present (the "Historical Location Information"). Because such 
data—like "Prospective Location Information"—constitutes information concerning a subscriber, 
the Court is authorized to order the Service Providers to provide this data pursuant to a warrant 
See In re Application, 460 F. Supp. 2d 448, 459-60 & n. 55 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (Kaplan, J.) 
(cellphone location information falls within § 2703(c)(1)); accord, e.g., United States v. Caraballo, 
963 F. Supp. 2d 341, 361 (D.Vt. 2013); In re Order, 632 F. Supp. 2d 202, 207 (E.D.N.Y. 2008); 
In re Application, 405 F. Supp. 2d 435, 444-45 (S.D.N.Y. 2005). But see In re Application, 849 
F. Supp. 2d 526, 574 (D.Md. 2011) (rejecting view that cellular location data falls within the scope 
of the SCA and finding that phone must be treated as "tracking device" for purposes of Rule 41 
where used to collect location data); In re Application, 2009 WL 159187, at *5-'1'6 (S.D.N.Y. 
Jan.13, 2009) (McMahon, J.) (same). 
See 18 U.S.C. § 3121 (prohibiting use of pen register or trap and trace device without an order 
under the pen register statute); 3127(3) & (4) (defining pen register and trap and trace device to 
include devices or processes that record, inter alio, signaling information). Although cell site data 
constitutes "signaling" information within the meaning of the pen register statute, a separate statute 
precludes the Government from relying "solely" on the authority provided by the pen register 
statute to ascertain a subscriber's location. 47 U.S.C. § 1002(a). Here, the Government seeks to 
obtain such data pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2703(c) as well as the pen register statute, rather than 
"solely" under the latter statute. See In re Application, 460 F. Supp. 2d at 456-59. 
2019.07.24 
EFTA00016351
--- PAGE 4 ---
application under 18 U.S.C. § 2703(c), under the applicable procedures of Rule 41. See 18 U.S.C. 
§ 2703(c)(1)(A). I respectfully submit that the same probable cause supporting the Government's 
request for a warrant to obtain the Prospective Location Information requested above also supports 
the issuance of a warrant under § 2703(c) for the requested Historical Location Information. In 
addition, the Government seeks toll records for the same period as the Historical Location 
Information. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2703(d), I respectfully submit that the Agent Affidavit offers 
specific and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the toll 
record information sought is relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation. 
C. Pen Register Information 
7. Finally, the Government seeks an order pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §§ 3121-26 authorizing 
the use of a pen register on the Target Cellphones for a period of 45 days from the date of this 
order. Specifically, the Government seeks an order directing the Service Providers to furnish any 
information, facilities, and technical assistance necessary to operate, unobtrusively and with 
minimum disruption of service, a pen register and trap and trace device to capture all dialing, 
routing, addressing, or signaling information associated with each call transmitted to or from the 
Target Cellphones, as specified further in the proposed Warrants and Orders (the "Pen Register 
Information").4
The Government is also not seeking authorization to obtain post-cut-through dialed digits 
("PCTDD"), or digits that are dialed after a telephone call from the Target Cellphones has been 
connected. Pursuant to the attached Order, if possible, the Service Provider will forward only pre-
cut-through-dialed digits to the Investigating Agency. 
However, if the Service Providers' 
technical capabilities require it to forward all dialed digits, including PCTDD, to the Investigating 
Agency, the Investigating Agency will only decode and forward to the agents assigned to the 
investigation the numbers that are dialed before the call is cut through. 
2019.07.24 
EFTA00016352
--- PAGE 5 ---
8. I hereby certify pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3122 that the Pen Register Information is 
relevant to an ongoing investigation being conducted by the Investigating Agency into suspected 
violations of the Subject Offenses by the Target Subject. 
D. Sealing and Non-Disclosure Order to Service Providers 
9. When the Government obtains records or information under § 2703(c), it is not required 
to notify the subscriber or customer. 18 U.S.C. § 2703(c)(3). Additionally, the Government may 
obtain an order precluding the Service Providers from notifying the subscriber or any other third-
party of the warrant or order obtained, for such period as the Court deems appropriate, where there 
is reason to believe that such notification will result in endangering the life or physical safety of 
an individual, flight from prosecution, destruction of or tampering with evidence, or intimidation 
of potential witnesses, or will otherwise seriously jeopardize the investigation. 18 U.S.C. 
§ 2705(b). 
10. Further, 18 U.S.C. § 3I23(d) provides that an order directing installation of a pen 
register or trap and trace device shall direct the pertinent service provider "not to disclose the 
existence of the pen register or trap and trace device or the existence of the investigation to the 
listed subscriber, or to any other person unless or until otherwise ordered by the Court." 
II. Accordingly, as explained further in the Agent Affidavit, in light of the confidential 
nature of the continuing criminal investigation and the adverse consequences expected in the event 
of premature notification, the Government respectfully requests that the Court direct the Service 
Providers not to notify the Subscribers or any other person of the Warrants and Orders sought 
herein for a period of one year, subject to extension upon application to the Court, if necessary. 
12. For similar reasons, I respectfully request that the proposed Warrants and Orders, this 
Application, and the accompanying Agent Affidavit, be maintained under seal until the Court 
orders otherwise, except that the Government be permitted without further order of this Court to 
2019.07.24

--- PAGE 6 ---
serve these Warrants and Orders on the Service Providers; provide copies of the Warrants and 
Orders or the supporting Application and Agent Affidavit as need be to personnel assisting the 
Government in the investigation and prosecution of this matter; and disclose these materials as 
necessary to comply with discovery and disclosure obligations in any prosecutions related to this 
matter. 
III. Prior Requests 
13. Except as may be set forth above, no prior request for the relief requested herein has 
been made.

STATE OF NEW YORK

COUNTY OF NEW YORK ) 
being duly sworn, deposes and states: 
Mag. 
I. Introduction 
I. I have been a Special Agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI" or 
"Investigating Agency") since 2017. As such, I am a "federal law enforcement officer within the 
meaning of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41(a)(2)(C), that is, a government agent engaged 
in enforcing the criminal laws and duly authorized by the Attorney General to request a search 
warrant. I am currently assigned to investigate violations of criminal law relating to the sexual 
exploitation of children as part of an FBI Task Force. I have gained expertise in this area through 
classroom training and daily work related to these types of investigations. As part of my 
responsibilities, I have been involved in the investigation of cases involving sex trafficking, 
enticement of minors, and transportation of minors for illegal sex acts, and have participated in the 
execution of search warrants involving electronic evidence. 
2. Requested Information. I respectfully submit this Affidavit pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 
§§ 2703(c) and (c)(1)(A) and the applicable procedures of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41; 
2019.07.24 
EFTA00016355
--- PAGE 8 ---
U.S.C. §§ 2703(d) & 2705; and 18 U.S.C. §§ 3121-3126, in support of two warrants and orders 
for prospective location information, historical location information, toll records, and pen register 
information, for the Target Cellphones identified below (collectively, the "Requested 
Information"). 
3. Basis for Knowledge. This Affidavit is based upon my participation in the 
investigation, my examination of reports and records, and my conversations with other law 
enforcement agents and other individuals, as well as my training and experience. Because this 
Affidavit is being submitted for the limited purpose of obtaining the Requested Information, it 
does not include all the facts that I have learned during the course of this investigation. Where the 
contents of documents and the actions, statements, and conversations of others are reported herein, 
they are reported in substance and in part, except where otherwise indicated. In addition, unless 
otherwise indicated, statements by others referenced in this Affidavit were not necessarily made 
to me, but may have been provided to me by someone else to whom I have spoken or whose report 
I have read (and who in turn may have had either direct or indirect knowledge of the statement). 
Similarly, unless otherwise indicated, information in this Affidavit resulting from surveillance 
does not necessarily set forth my personal observations, but may have been provided to me by 
other law enforcement agents who observed the events, and to whom I have spoken or whose 
report I have read. 
4. Target Cellphones, Subscribers, Target Subject, and Service Providers. The 
Target Cellphones referenced in this Affidavit are the cellphone assigned call number 
("Target Cellphone-1") and the cellphone assigned call number 
("Target 
Cellphone-2," and collectively with Target Cellphone-1, the "Target Cellphones"). As further 
discussed below, Target Cellphone-1 is subscribed to in the name of "Terramar Project, Inc." 
2019.07.24 
EFTA00016356
--- PAGE 9 ---
("Subscriber-1"), and Target Cellphone-2 is subscribed to in the name of "G Max" ("Subscriber-
2," and collectively with Subscriber-I, the "Subscribers"). GHISLAINE MAXWELL is believed 
to use the Target Cellphones and is a Target Subject of this investigation. T-Mobile is the Service 
Provider for Target Cellphone-1, and AT&T is the Service Provider for Target Cellphone-2. 
5. Precision Location Capability. 
Cellphone service providers have technical 
capabilities that allow them to collect at least two kinds of information about the locations of the 
cellphones to which they provide service: (a) precision location information, also known as E-911 
Phase II data, GPS data, or latitude-longitude data, and (b) cell site data, also known as 
"tower/face" or "tower/sector" information. Precision location information provides relatively 
precise location information about a cellphone, which a provider can typically collect either via 
GPS tracking technology built into the phone or by triangulating the device's signal as received 
by the provider's nearby cell towers. Cell site data, by contrast, reflects only the cell tower and 
sector thereof utilized in routing any communication to and from the cellphone, as well as the 
approximate range of the cellphone from the tower during the communication (sometimes referred 
to as "per-call measurement" ("PCM") or "round-trip time" ("RTT") data). Because cell towers 
are often a half-mile or more apart, even in urban areas, and can be ten or more miles apart in rural 
areas, cell site data is typically less precise than precision location information. Based on my 
training and experience, I know that the Service Providers have the technical ability to collect 
precision location information from any cellphone on its network, including by initiating a signal 
on the Service Providers' network to determine the phone's location. I further know that cell site 
2019.07.24 
EFTA00016357
--- PAGE 10 ---
data is routinely collected by the Service Providers in the course of routing calls placed to or from 
any cellphone on their network.' 
6. Successor Service Provider. Because it is possible that the Target Subject may change 
cellphone service provider during the course of this investigation, it is requested that the warrant 
and investigative order requested apply without need for further order to any Successor Service 
Provider who may provide service to the Target Cellphones during the time frames at issue herein. 
II. Facts Establishing Probable Cause 
7. Although I understand that probable cause is not necessary to obtain all of the 
Requested Information, I respectfully submit that probable cause exists to believe that the 
Requested Information will lead to the location of a person, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, to be 
arrested for the crimes of conspiracy to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in 
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; enticement of a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in 
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2422; conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in criminal 
sexual activity, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; transporting a minor with intent to engage in 
criminal sexual activity, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a); and perjury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 
§ 1623 (the "Subject Offenses"). 
8. On June 29, 2020, a grand jury in the Southern District of New York returned an 
indictment charging GHISLAINE MAXWELL with the Subject Offenses. The Indictment 
charging MAXWELL is attached as Exhibit A hereto (the "Indictment"). That same day, United 
States Magistrate Judge Lisa Margaret Smith signed a warrant for MAXWELL's arrest, which is 
attached as Exhibit B hereto (the "Arrest Warrant"). 
' Toll records are sometimes necessary or helpful in order to obtain or interpret historical cell site 
data and are therefore also requested herein. 
2019.07.24 
EFTA00016358
--- PAGE 11 ---
9. In light of these pending charges in the Indictment and the issuance of the Arrest 
Warrant, GHISLAINE MAXWELL is subject to arrest for the Subject Offenses. 
10. Based on my review of T-Mobile records, I have learned that Target Cellphone-1 is 
subscribed in the name of "Terramar Project, Inc." Based on my review of publicly available 
videos and related information, I know that GHISLAINE MAXWELL has given multiple public 
addresses in her capacity as the founder and president of an organization known as the TerraMar 
Project, a non-profit organization that, as noted, was founded and run by MAXWELL and devoted 
to ocean protection. 
II. As set forth in Paragraph 3 of Exhibit A, MAXWELL was a close associate and 
employee of Jeffrey Epstein's. Additionally, as set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 19 of Exhibit A, 
MAXWELL is charged with committing four of the Subject Offenses together with Epstein. I 
know from my participation in this investigation that on or about July 6, 2019, Epstein was arrested 
by the FBI on federal sex trafficking charges. During that arrest, the FBI seized an iPhone from 
Epstein's possession (the "Epstein Phone"). Pursuant to a judicially authorized search warrant, 
the FBI subsequently searched the contents of the Epstein Phone. Among other things, that search 
revealed that the phone number associated with Target Cellphone-1 was saved as a contact in the 
Epstein Phone under the name "Ghislaine." 
12. I further know from my review of T-Mobile records the following: 
a. Target Cellphone-1 has been active within the last 30 days. 
b. Target Cellphone-1 has been in contact with a phone subscribed to in the name 
of "Joshua Perry," which I know from my review of a law enforcement database is the name of 
the husband of a former employee of Jeffrey Epstein (the "Joshua Perry Phone"). The most recent 
contact between Target Cellphone-1 and the Joshua Perry Phone occurred in or about May 2020. 
2019.07.24 
EFTA00016359
--- PAGE 12 ---
c. Target Cellphone-1 has also been in contact with a phone subscribed to the 
business "Haddon, Morgan, & Foreman," which I know from my review of court records is the 
name of a law firm that currently represents GHISLAINE MAXWELL in civil litigation (the 
"Haddon, Morgan, & Foreman Phone"). The most recent contact between Target Cellphone-1 and 
the Haddon, Morgan, & Foreman Phone occurred in or about February 2020. 
d. Target Cellphone-1 has also been in contact with a phone subscribed to in the 
name of "Isabel Maxwell," which I know from my review of a law enforcement database is the 
name of GHISLAINE MAXWELL's sister (the "Isabel Maxwell Phone"). The most recent 
contact between Target Cellphone-1 and the Isabel Maxwell Phone occurred in or about August 
2019. 
e. Target Cellphone-1 has also been in contact with a phone subscribed to in the 
name of "Laura Menninger," which I know from my review of court records is the name of an 
attorney who currently represents GHISLAINE MAXWELL in civil litigation (the "Laura 
Menninger Phone"). 
The most recent contact between Target Cellphone-I and the Laura 
Menninger Phone occurred in or about August 2019. 
f. Target Cellphone-1 has also been in contact with a phone subscribed to in the 
name of "Scott Borgerson," which I know from my review of bank records and Amazon records 
is the name of an individual with whom GHISLAINE MAXWELL shares a joint bank account 
and to whom MAXWELL's Amazon account has sent multiple packages within approximately 
the last year (the "Scott Borgerson Phone"). The most recent contact between Target Cellphone-1 
and the Scott Borgerson Phone occurred in or about August 2019. 
13. Accordingly, I respectfully submit there is probable cause to believe that the location 
of Target Cellphone-1 will reveal the location of GHISLAINE MAXWELL.

--- PAGE 13 ---
14. Based on my review of AT&T records, I have learned that Target Cellphone-2 is 
subscribed in the name of "G Max," which appears to be a shortened version of GHISLAINE 
MAXWELL's name. I further know from my review of AT&T records that Target Cellphone-2 
has been active within the last 30 days. In particular, within the last 30 days, Target Cellphone-2 
has been in contact with the Isabel Maxwell Phone, the Laura Menninger Phone, the Haddon, 
Morgan, & Foreman Phone, and the Scott Borgerson Phone. 
15. Accordingly, I respectfully submit that there is probable cause to believe that the 
location of Target Cellphone-2 will reveal the location of GHISLAINE MAXWELL. 
III. Request for Warrants and Orders 
16. Based on the foregoing, I respectfully request that the Court require the Service 
Providers to provide the Requested Information as specified further in the Warrants and Orders 
proposed herewith, including prospective precision location and cell site data for a period of 45 
days from the date of this Order, historical cell site data and toll records for the period from June 
I, 2020 through the date of this Order, and pen register information for a period of 45 days from 
the date of this Order. 
1. 
Nondisclosure. The scope of this ongoing criminal investigation and existence of 
the Indictment and Arrest Warrant are not publicly known. As a result, premature public disclosure 
of this affidavit or the requested Warrants and Orders could alert GHISLAINE MAXWELL that 
she is under investigation and subject to arrest, causing her to destroy evidence, flee from 
prosecution, or otherwise seriously jeopardize the investigation. Specifically: 
a. As evidenced by the charges alleged in the Indictment, MAXWELL is known 
to have participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Alerting her to the existence and scope of 
the investigation may lead her to intimidate witnesses. See 18 U.S.C. § 2705(b)(1),(4). 
2019.07.24 
EFTA00016361
--- PAGE 14 ---
b. Additionally, the Target Subject is at liberty in the community. Premature 
disclosure of the existence of this application and the charges contained in the Indictment could 
result in the Target Subject fleeing from prosecution if she were made aware of the pending charges 
before arrest. See 18 U.S.C. § 2705(b)(2). 
17. Accordingly, there is reason to believe that, were the Service Providers to notify the 
subscribers or others of the existence of the warrant, the investigation would be seriously 
jeopardized. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2705(b), I therefore respectfully request that the Service 
Providers be directed not to notify the subscribers or others of the existence of the Warrants and 
Orders for a period of one year, and that the Warrants and Orders and all supporting papers be 
maintained under seal until the Court orders otherwise, as specified in the Application submitted 
in conjunction with this Affidavit.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
x 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 
Defendant. 
SEALED 
INDICTMENT
Cr. 
COUNT ONE 
(Conspiracy to Entice Minors to Travel to Engage in 
Illegal Sex Acts) 
The Grand Jury charges: 
OVERVIEW 
1. 
The charges set forth herein stem from the role 
of GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, in the sexual exploitation 
and abuse of multiple minor girls by Jeffrey Epstein. In 
particular, from at least in or about 1994, up to and including 
at least in or about 1997, MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and 
contributed to Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among 
other things, helping Epstein to recruit, groom, and ultimately 
abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age 
of 18. The victims were as young as 14 years old when they were 
groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
that certain victims were in fact under the age of 18. 
2. 
As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to 
abuse minor victims, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, and 
Jeffrey Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to 
EFTA00016373
--- PAGE 2 ---
Epstein's residences in different states, which MAXWELL knew and 
intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to 
sexual abuse. Moreover, in an effort to conceal her crimes, 
MAXWELL repeatedly lied when questioned about her conduct, 
including in relation to some of the minor victims described 
herein, when providing testimony under oath in 2016. 
FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
3. 
During the time periods charged in this 
Indictment, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, had a personal and 
professional relationship with Jeffrey Epstein and was among his 
closest associates. In particular, between in or about 1994 and 
in or about 1997, MAXWELL was in an intimate relationship with 
Epstein and also was paid by Epstein to manage his various 
properties. Over the course of their relationship, MAXWELL and 
Epstein were photographed together on multiple occasions, 
including in the below image: 
EFTA00016374
--- PAGE 3 ---
4. 
Beginning in at least 1994, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 
the defendant, enticed and groomed multiple minor girls to 
engage in sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein, through a variety of 
means and methods, including but not limited to the following: 
a. 
MAXWELL first attempted to befriend some of 
Epstein's minor victims prior to their abuse, including by 
asking the victims about their lives, their schools, and their 
families. MAXWELL and Epstein would spend time building 
friendships with minor victims by, for example, taking minor 
victims to the movies or shopping. Some of these outings would 
involve MAXWELL and Epstein spending time together with a minor 
victim, while some would involve MAXWELL or Epstein spending 
time alone with a minor victim. 
b. 
Having developed a rapport with a victim, 
MAXWELL would try to normalize sexual abuse for a minor victim 
by, among other things, discussing sexual topics, undressing in 
front of the victim, being present when a minor victim was 
undressed, and/or being present for sex acts involving the minor 
victim and Epstein. 
c. 
MAXWELL'S presence during minor victims' 
interactions with Epstein, including interactions where the 
minor victim was undressed or that involved sex acts with 
Epstein, helped put the victims at ease because an adult woman 
was present. For example, in some instances, MAXWELL would 
EFTA00016375
--- PAGE 4 ---
massage Epstein in front of a minor victim. In other instances, 
MAXWELL encouraged minor victims to provide massages to Epstein, 
including sexualized massages during which a minor victim would 
be fully or partially nude. Many of those massages resulted in 
Epstein sexually abusing the minor victims. 
d. 
In addition, Epstein offered to help some 
minor victims by paying for travel and/or educational 
opportunities, and MAXWELL encouraged certain victims to accept 
Epstein's assistance. As a result, victims were made to feel 
indebted and believed that MAXWELL and Epstein were trying to 
help them. 
e. 
Through this process, MAXWELL and Epstein 
enticed victims to engage in sexual activity with Epstein. In 
some instances, MAXWELL was present for and participated in the 
sexual abuse of minor victims. Some such incidents occurred in 
the context of massages, which developed into sexual encounters. 
5. 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, facilitated 
Jeffrey Epstein's access to minor victims knowing that he had a 
sexual preference for underage girls and that he intended to 
engage in sexual activity with those victims. Epstein's 
resulting abuse of minor victims included, among other things, 
touching a victim's breast, touching a victim's genitals, 
placing a sex toy such as a vibrator on a victim's genitals, 
EFTA00016376
--- PAGE 5 ---
directing a victim to touch Epstein while he masturbated, and 
directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. 
MAXWELL AND EPSTEIN'S VICTIMS 
6. 
Between approximately in or about 1994 and in or 
about 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, facilitated 
Jeffrey Epstein's access to minor victims by, among other 
things, inducing and enticing, and aiding and abetting the 
inducement and enticement of, multiple minor victims. Victims 
were groomed and/or abused at multiple locations, including the 
following: 
a. 
A a multi-story private residence on the 
Upper East Side of Manhattan, New York owned by Epstein (the 
"New York Residence"), which is depicted in the following 
photograph: 
EFTA00016377
--- PAGE 6 ---
b. 
An estate in Palm Beach, Florida owned by 
Epstein (the "Palm Beach Residence"), which is depicted in the 
following photograph: 
c. 
A ranch in Santa Fe, New Mexico owned by 
Epstein (the "New Mexico Residence"), which is depicted in the 
following photograph: 
EFTA00016378
--- PAGE 7 ---
d. 
MAXWELL's personal residence in London, 
England. 
7. 
Among the victims induced or enticed by GHISLAINE 
MAXWELL, the defendant, were minor victims identified herein as 
Minor Victim-1, Minor Victim-2, and Minor Victim-3. In 
particular, and during time periods relevant to this Indictment, 
MAXWELL engaged in the following acts, among others, with 
respect to minor victims: 
a. 
MAXWELL met Minor Victim-1 when Minor 
Victim-1 was approximately 14 years old. MAXWELL subsequently 
interacted with Minor Victim-1 on multiple occasions at 
Epstein's residences, knowing that Minor Victim-1 was under the 
age of 18 at the time. During these interactions, which took 
place between approximately 1994 and 1997, MAXWELL groomed Minor 
Victim-1 to engage in sexual acts with Epstein through multiple 
means. First, MAXWELL and Epstein attempted to befriend Minor 
Victim-1, taking her to the movies and on shopping trips. 
MAXWELL also asked Minor Victim-1 about school, her classes, her 
family, and other aspects of her life. MAXWELL then sought to 
normalize inappropriate and abusive conduct by, among other 
things, undressing in front of Minor Victim-1 and being present 
when Minor Victim-1 undressed in front of Epstein. Within the 
first year after MAXWELL and Epstein met Minor Victim-1, Epstein 
began sexually abusing Minor Victim-1. MAXWELL was present for 
EFTA00016379
--- PAGE 8 ---
and involved in some of this abuse. In particular, MAXWELL 
involved Minor Victim-1 in group sexualized massages of Epstein. 
During those group sexualized massages, MAXWELL and/or Minor 
Victim-1 would engage in sex acts with Epstein. Epstein and 
MAXWELL both encouraged Minor Victim-1 to travel to Epstein's 
residences in both New York and Florida. As a result, Minor 
Victim-1 was sexually abused by Epstein in both New York and 
Florida. Minor Victim-1 was enticed to travel across state 
lines for the purpose of sexual encounters with Epstein, and 
MAXWELL was aware that Epstein engaged in sexual activity with 
Minor Victim-1 after Minor-Victim-1 traveled to Epstein's 
properties, including in the context of a sexualized massage. 
b. 
MAXWELL interacted with Minor Victim-2 on at 
least one occasion in or about 1996 at Epstein's residence in 
New Mexico when Minor Victim-2 was under the age of 18. Minor 
Victim-2 had flown into New Mexico from out of state at 
Epstein's invitation for the purpose of being groomed for and/or 
subjected to acts of sexual abuse. MAXWELL knew that Minor 
Victim-2 was under the age of 18 at the time. While in New 
Mexico, MAXWELL and Epstein took Minor Victim-2 to a movie and 
MAXWELL took Minor Victim-2 shopping. MAXWELL also discussed 
Minor Victim-2's school, classes, and family with Minor Victim-
2. In New Mexico, MAXWELL began her efforts to groom Minor 
Victim-2 for abuse by Epstein by, among other things, providing 
EFTA00016380
--- PAGE 9 ---
an unsolicited massage to Minor Victim-2, during which Minor 
Victim-2 was topless. MAXWELL also encouraged Minor Victim-2 to 
massage Epstein. 
c. 
MAXWELL groomed and befriended Minor 
Victim-3 in London, England between approximately 1994 and 1995, 
including during a period of time in which MAXWELL knew that 
Minor Victim-3 was under the age of 18. Among other things, 
MAXWELL discussed Minor Victim-3's life and family with Minor 
Victim-3. MAXWELL introduced Minor Victim-3 to Epstein and 
arranged for multiple interactions between Minor Victim-3 and 
Epstein. During those interactions, MAXWELL encouraged Minor 
Victim-3 to massage Epstein, knowing that Epstein would engage 
in sex acts with Minor Victim-3 during those massages. Minor 
Victim-3 provided Epstein with the requested massages, and 
during those massages, Epstein sexually abused Minor Victim-3. 
MAXWELL was aware that Epstein engaged in sexual activity with 
Minor Victim-3 on multiple occasions, including at times when 
Minor Victim-3 was under the age of 18, including in the context 
of a sexualized massage. 
MAXWELL'S EFFORTS TO CONCEAL HER CONDUCT 
8. 
In or around 2016, in the context of a deposition 
as part of civil litigation, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, 
repeatedly provided false and perjurious statements, under oath, 
regarding, among other subjects, her role in facilitating the 
EFTA00016381
--- PAGE 10 ---
abuse of minor victims by Jeffrey Epstein, including some of the 
specific events and acts of abuse detailed above. 
STATUTORY ALLEGATIONS 
9. 
From at least in or about 1994, up to and 
including in or about 1997, in the Southern District of New York 
and elsewhere, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, Jeffrey 
Epstein, and others known and unknown, willfully and knowingly 
did combine, conspire, confederate, and agree together and with 
each other to commit an offense against the United States, to 
wit, enticement, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, 
Section 2422. 
10. It was a part and object of the conspiracy that 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, and others 
known and unknown, would and did knowingly persuade, induce, 
entice, and coerce one and more individuals to travel in

Aida, 
To confirm, we are looking into whether video of the hallway, and videos and/or photos of the cell exist. We likely would 
make those available for review in the same manner as the report. We are also looking into whether the orange rope was 
preserved and if it was, we will let you know our position on whether it can be made available for inspection. As discussed 
briefly, since you have reviewed a photograph of the rope, we are not sure the basis for a physical inspection and would 
ask you to articulate one for our consideration.

Hello 
Thank you for taking the time to let us review sensitive disclosure materials in your office on Friday. We appreciate it. I 
just wanted to memorialize a few follow-up questions we had. 
1. It is our understanding that there is video surveillance in the hallway in or near the tier that was preserved in 
reference to the July 23 incident. We would like to see a copy of it. 
2. 
It is our understanding that there may be photographs or a video recording of cell 124 that would have been 
taken shortly after the incident. If so, we would like to see them. 
3. 
If the orange rope was preserved, we would like to view it in person. 
I understand that you were not aware of the availability of the above and that you would look into this additional 
discovery. I just wanted to memorialize our follow up inquiries for your records. 
Lastly, if the items above are available, does your office take a position with respect to our request to view them? We 
just need to know so we can plan our next course of action. 
See you in Court, and thank you again for your time.

Thanks again for taking the lead on this stuff. I'll be in a meeting from about 10:30am to 3pm today, but otherwise am 
available if there's anything you want to discuss before tomorrow's conference. I have a 10am plea in White Plains 
tomorrow, so I'm planning to take the train up.

Aida, 
To confirm, we are looking into whether video of the hallway, and videos and/or photos of the cell exist. We likely would 
make those available for review in the same manner as the report. We are also looking into whether the orange rope was 
preserved and if it was, we will let you know our position on whether it can be made available for inspection. As discussed 
briefly, since you have reviewed a photograph of the rope, we are not sure the basis for a physical inspection and would 
ask you to articulate one for our consideration.

Hello 
Thank you for taking the time to let us review sensitive disclosure materials in your office on Friday. We appreciate it. I 
just wanted to memorialize a few follow-up questions we had. 
1. It is our understanding that there is video surveillance in the hallway in or near the tier that was preserved in 
reference to the July 23 incident. We would like to see a copy of it. 
2. 
It is our understanding that there may be photographs or a video recording of cell 124 that would have been 
taken shortly after the incident. If so, we would like to see them. 
3. 
If the orange rope was preserved, we would like to view it in person.

I understand that you were not aware of the availability of the above and that you would look into this additional 
discovery. I just wanted to memorialize our follow up inquiries for your records. 
Lastly, if the items above are available, does your office take a position with respect to our request to view them? We 
just need to know so we can plan our next course of action. 
See you in Court, and thank you again for your time.

I am writing to request the preservation of all video surveillance that captures the hallway outside of

the date and time of the Epstein incident that is currently being investigated. I believe that the date and time is July 23 
during the early morning hours. Accordingly, I would ask that all video surveillance from July 22 at 11 pm to July 23 at 4 am 
is preserved. If it is your understanding that the incident occurred at a different time, please let me know and preserve the 
relevant footage, including an hour before the incident and an hour afterwards. If the responding officers were wearing 
body cameras that captured the inside of the cell in the aftermath of the incident, I am requesting that such footage also 
be preserved. 
We will be officially requesting this material through the appropriate means, but please consider this email a formal 
preservation request.

(the "Subpoena"). This letter and the enclosed document production represent the thirteenth 
submission in our client's rolling response to the Subpoena. 
Enclosed with this letter is an encrypted file labeled DB-SDNY-PROD013, responsive to 
items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 26, and 27 of the Subpoena. The documents 
are labeled DB-SDNY-0100861 to 0124801. We have prepared a production index, attached as 
Appendix A, which identifies the following categories of documents responsive to the Subpoena: 
•-Emails: 
Today's production contains emails from the custodial 
files of 
who served as Jeffrey Epstein's relationship manager from 
2013 to 2016. The emails generally relate to Mr. 
management of the 
Bank's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein and his associates. Mr. 
emails are responsive to multiple requests in the Subpoena, including account 
openings, Ke
ys, wire transfers, and correspondence with account 
holders. Mr.
emails are identified as' 
Emails" in the attached 
production inc cx. 
• 
mails: Today's production contains emails from the custodial 
files of 
who served as the Co-Head of 
from 2013 to 2016. Mr. Packard was involved in the decision to

onboard Mr. Epstein as a client, as well as the decision to maintain the 
relationship after concerns were raised in January 2015. Mr. 
emails 
are designated '=Emails" 
in the attached production index. 
The decryption password for the production will be provided by separate email. As we 
have discussed, we continue to collect relevant information related to the Subpoena, and expect to 
make additional productions in the near future. 
Because we are producing these materials pursuant to a grand jury subpoena, it is our 
understanding that this production will be treated as confidential consistent with Federal Rule of 
Criminal Procedure 6(e). Notwithstanding the confidentiality of the enclosed materials and 
information, should you receive any request for disclosure of such information, pursuant to the 
Freedom of Information Act or otherwise, we ask to be notified in a timely fashion and given the 
opportunity to object to such disclosure. Further, should you determine to disclose any materials 
to any third party, we ask to be given reasonable advance notice in order to allow us to pursue any 
available remedies. In such event, we request that you contact the undersigned by email or 
telephone rather than rely on regular mail or facsimile transmission to provide such notice. Please 
advise us if you object to or disagree with the foregoing requests. 
For the avoidance of doubt, no response or document provided in response to the Subpoena 
shall be construed as a waiver of any applicable privilege or doctrine available to Deutsche Bank 
under state or federal law. If it were found that production of any of the enclosed materials 
constitutes disclosure of otherwise privileged matters, such disclosure would be inadvertent. By 
the production of such documents, Deutsche Bank does not intend to waive and has not waived 
the attorney-client privilege or any other protections. 
Please do not hesitate to contact us at 
or 
if you 
have any questions. We look forward to continuing to wor with you in a cooperative manner.

Thanks for this, it's a helpful start. In terms of being able to write our search warrant, one additional piece of information 
we need is the serial number, or some other specific identifier, ideally for each device but at least for any device that there 
is more than one of the same thing. So for example, we need to be able to somehow differentiate the following devices — 
The two Dell power edge T310 hard drives (NYCO24323 and NYCO24324) 
The two Sony Vaio laptop / Fujitsu hdd (NYCO24336 and NYCO24337) 
the following loose storage devices: 
o Micro SD card (NYCO24339) 
o Flash Drive (generic) (NYCO24340) 
o Thumbdrive (Emtec) (NYCO24341) 
o hard drive (loose) (NYCO24342) 
o verbatim thumbdrive (NYCO24343) 
The four San Disk cruzer-thumbdrives (NYCO24344-47) 
The three Seagate IDE hard drives (NYCO24348-50) 
The camera SD card (NYCO24351) 
EFTA00016425
--- PAGE 2 ---
I think the rest of the devices are either specifically distinguishable and/or have an S/N listed. (By comparison, the USVI 
spreadsheet we have lists an s/n for about 20 of the 25(ish) devices. 
The other thing we're looking for is the location in the house (and ideally specific location) for each device, which the USVI 
list also has — is that info available? 
The list also has just five devices as still pending to be transferred to us, and I think it's right that the plan is to reproduce 
all the materials so that we can get them in searchable format, but just wanted to confirm? Currently, we aren't able to 
match any of the prior productions to specific devices — so if we're able to match them up by Bates number now, that 
might work, but otherwise I think it makes sense for us to get everything. But let us know if any issue with that. 
thanks very much,

Here is The listing of all the evidence gathered in NY that I have. I added some columns to guide you to the 
unique numbers CART NY uses fro their evidence. The template wasn't a slam dunk over, so I did what I could to 
convey the information. If you are confused by anything, please let me know. In the column for approximate 
size, it is in GB, totaled at the bottom and converted to TB. In the materials contained column, I put what load 
file group the data was transferred over in (Mac, Windows, Loose Media, IDE, or Blacklight) If there is no entry 
in that column, that data has yet to be transferred. There are 2 Macs and a DVR you don't have as well as an 
iPhone and an iPad. IF the descriptions are a bit light, let me know and I'll do what I can to beef them up. I will 
get you the Island stuff tomorrow.

Respectfully, I think there are some miscommunications here — all we have asked is to receive the materials in a format 
such that we can view them using a system we have access to. We're not able to get web-enabled access through any FBI 
tool, so we asked for the materials to be transferred in a loadable format so we could put them on Relativity, which both 
EFTA00016426
--- PAGE 3 ---
we and the agents can access. We're required to have the files in a format that we can produce them to defense counsel. 
I've done that in many other cases and it hasn't previously been an issue. My understanding from 
is that the best 
way to do it now is just for us (the U.S. Attorney's Office) to get the original files, which our vendor will process—by which 
I just mean converting into file formats that are loadable onto Relativity. It doesn't really have anything to do with the 
taint review—we have to have access to the docs in our systems for discovery purposes. 
And we were happy to get the materials as they were processed, but when we received the 1.1 million documents earlier 
this year, they were in a format that wasn't usable for the reasons described in the email I sent on March 9. Again, I 
understand from 
that the best way forward is to just get copies of the materials in their original formats, which I 
understand will be segregated and designated by device. That should work for us! I was just trying to understand the 
approach, as well as the timeline. 
thanks,

Just to be clear. The US Attorney's Office (or it's contractors) are not "processing" anything. You are taking files 
that I will be extracting from processed evidence and putting them into an E-Discovery tool (Relativity) to do a 
taint review. 
Relativity is NOT a forensic tool. It is incapable of dealing with many things that are found forensically on a 
computer like free space, slack space, and system files to name a few. When we started this, and you insisted 
you do the taint review in Relativity, I warned you that it was adding months worth of work on top of what was 
already done, and that Relativity was incapable of viewing everything. You insisted we do it this way. So now 
and I have come up with a way to fit this round peg into this square hole. We will get it done. 
Sorry it has taken so long, but we are talking about terabytes worth of data over multiple forms of digital 
evidence. Phones, tablets, loose media, cameras, DVRs, servers, laptops, and desktop computers. We have 
gotten past encryption on multiple devices. When we review devices on such large cases, we usually do it piece 
by piece as things are processed, I was unaware that you didn't want to review as things were processed, that 
you wanted to do it "all at once", so that added to the delay. Sorry for that. Just a differentiation of 
methodology I suppose. 
and I feel confident that the method we have come up with will be more consistent and preserve the 
attribution of files to devices and links of e-mails to attachments that the load file generation that I did a while 
back was lacking.

Okay, so just to check, you both think that there is not a need to do a test run? You're both comfortable with just basically 
sending us copies of everything? I don't totally understand why we couldn't have done that eight months ago, but 
regardless of the passage of time, I want to make sure we understand so we can report to our supervisors. I assume that 
means that we (at the U.S. Attorney's Office and through contractors) will therefore need to do all the processing 
ourselves, correct? And thanks again to you both.

Unfortunately I don't think this is very helpful to us. Did you take a look at the example spreadsheet I sent on 2/24? The 
excel file you sent has descriptions that don't match up to the items listed in the search warrant returns (that we sent on 
2/23), and we don't have the 1B or CART numbers to be able to cross-reference. We also can't tell what you mean by 
"loose media" without a specific comparison to what was seized, we don't know which items you're referring to as 
"Windows machines," and we can't tell whether the entirety of any particular item has been transferred, or just partial. 
For example, it looks like we have gotten very, very few image files, which is surprising. 
We have also encountered some very significant problems in trying to review the more than 1 million documents we 
recently received: 
The data we've received has no way to put any emails and attachments together. So if an email says, "see the 
attached flight records," for example, we have no way of linking that up with the records themselves. Not only is 
that a big problem for us in review, it's going to be a huge problem for producing the documents to defense 
counsel. 
The load file has no link to the native file, so when we load the data to the database, there's no way to have the 
native files show up in the database. Because many of the files are too large to open in the viewer, it effectively 
means that there are many files that are completely invisible to us. 
Related, the control numbers in the load file don't match up to the native files. So we have two sets of numbers 
and no way to match up anything—that is, even if we were to try to go hunt down every individual large file in the 
native files, it would be impossible. 
So the data that we most recently got, we need to get in a form that addresses those issues, and we likely will need to get 
a similar reproduction of the data we received a couple months ago. Otherwise we're sifting through more than a million 
documents without much rhyme or reason. 
I've re-attached the spreadsheet we sent last week — I think that's a good place to start in terms of our necessary record-
keeping, and we need that info at the very least, as well as anything else you think would be useful. Also attaching the SW 
returns for reference. And again, we're happy to meet up anytime and hash all this out in person if that's useful.

Here is a listing of what I have already handed over in load files to the US Attorney's Office for taint review. Some points of 
clarification: There were 9 IDE hard drives found in the Manhattan apartment, they turned out to be 3 copies of 3 drives 
(9 drives in total) from a July 2007 search on one of his properties. I only processed 3 (as they were all copies). All the 
loose media from the NY apartment is included. All the Windows machines from the NY apartment are included. Only 2 
Macs from NY and 1 from the Island are included. 
I will have to more closely coordinate with whoever is loading up Relativity with the remaining Macs as the tool 
they have to be processed with does not easily re-name the load files.

Something roughly like the attached, with any other categories you think would be useful — and the info on the attached is

Sony for the delayed response. They are tearing out our old network and giving us a new one, they mandated we 
delete old stuff (about 400 TB worth). Now that they are working on replacing the network, we can do only local 
work. I should be able to give you an accounting of what is what. I can say, off the top of my head, that all 
windows based items from the NY search have been handed over as well as all loose media. The CDs from NY 
only contained pictures, no documents. There are still some Apple items from NY that need to be produced. As 
far as the Island stuff goes, the 1st item on your spreadsheet, the "kitchen" mac has been produced. Still working 
on the rest.

devices the materials came from, whether it's full or partial results, how many more devices we have coming, etc. 
Based on the attached search warrant returns, it looks like from the New York mansion (the PDF) there are approximately 
devices that would have storage (computers, hard drives, thumb drives, etc.) and that's not even counting at least 60+ 
CDs. And then from the Virgin Islands (the Excel spreadsheet), at least more than 25 devices, including multiple servers / 
server racks. 
So we gotta know what we've already received, what remains, anticipated schedule, etc, and I know it's a lot of moving

I'm not sure who's the exact right person to ask this, so wanted to get everybody on one email chain about it — I have the 
hard drive that 
dropped off that has new Epstein search warrant materials, but it looks like there are also old 
materials (that I think we had previously received and uploaded??) on the hard drive, and so I'm not sure what's new. 
Just generally, and 
and I talked about this last week too, but it's basically impossible for us to keep track of what 
we're getting, and what has been completed, without some kind of identification or labeling system, along with a list of 
which devices have been extracted and downloaded. 
So for example on the hard drive currently, there are 38 folders labeled "loadFiles" through "37loadFiles" with a modified 
date of 11/14/19, which I think we may have already previously received — but I'm not sure, because we haven't gotten 
any info on which folders match up to which devices, etc. And then there's another folder titled "NYCO24362" that has a 
modified date of 1/27/20, so I think that may be the materials we hadn't previously received? That folder by itself has 
more than 600,000 items. 
EFTA00016435

I don't want to give I= 
anything that we've already previously received and uploaded, and I can't tell from the folder or 
file names whether everything on the drive is new, or whether just additional materials were saved onto it in addition to 
what we already have. =, 
are you able to give us some guidance on this? Ultimately what we really need is a 
spreadsheet of every device, whether it's been dumped (or partially dumped), and then identifying that same info —
which device, and what materials from it — are being given to us with each data transfer. Otherwise I think 
organizationally and for review purposes it will be a total disaster for us. 
We're happy to have a meeting on this if that's helpful — and thanks everybody for the assistance.

Okay thanks, just wanted to make sure given that column. If you could please confirm with him as he starts to send us 
stuff, that would be great — we'll basically just want to re-load all that stuff (which, separately, also got uploaded to the 
wrong folder structure in Relativity so we can circle up on that whenever you get the new info too). Thanks.

I mentioned to 
that the only first delivery we were able to upload to the database and told him the issues with the 
other two deliveries. I believed that he understands that he needs to replace those deliveries that we could not use.

Following up on our discussions, I think this actually looks fairly useful. The only thing I wanted to highlight to you is that 
based on this spreadsheet, it seems to say that only five devices from NY have materials that are still outstanding to be 
transferred to us (looking at the "Remaining to be transferred" column). Just based on what we've gotten so far, I find 
that difficult to understand (since we have so few overall dots), but even assuming that's right, *anything* in the prior 
two transfers to us (one hard drive that we did upload, that was all screwed up for the reasons you previously identified, 
and one hard drive that we didn't upload for the same reasons) needs to be re-transferred based on the format you and 
have discussed, right? 
I just want to make sure he doesn't only transfer what he views as "remaining," leaving us with like 95% of the material 
being in a form that's not useful for us. And figured I'd check with you to see if that's your understanding with him before 
replying all to clarify. 
thank you!

Here is The listing of all the evidence gathered in NY that I have. I added some columns to guide you to the 
unique numbers CART NY uses fro their evidence. The template wasn't a slam dunk over, so I did what I could to 
convey the information. If you are confused by anything, please let me know. In the column for approximate 
size, it is in GB, totaled at the bottom and converted to TB. In the materials contained column, I put what load 
file group the data was transferred over in (Mac, Windows, Loose Media, IDE, or Blacklight) If there is no entry 
in that column, that data has yet to be transferred. There are 2 Macs and a DVR you don't have as well as an 
iPhone and an iPad. IF the descriptions are a bit light, let me know and I'll do what I can to beef them up. I will 
get you the Island stuff tomorrow.

Subject: RE: Epstein search warrant documents 
Respectfully, I think there are some miscommunications here — all we have asked is to receive the materials in a format 
such that we can view them using a system we have access to. We're not able to get web-enabled access through any FBI 
tool, so we asked for the materials to be transferred in a loadable format so we could put them on Relativity, which both 
we and the agents can access. We're required to have the files in a format that we can produce them to defense counsel. 
I've done that in many other cases and it hasn't previously been an issue. My understanding from 
is that the best 
way to do it now is just for us (the U.S. Attorney's Office) to get the original files, which our vendor will process—by which 
I just mean converting into file formats that are loadable onto Relativity. It doesn't really have anything to do with the 
taint review—we have to have access to the docs in our systems for discovery purposes. 
And we were happy to get the materials as they were processed, but when we received the 1.1 million documents earlier 
this year, they were in a format that wasn't usable for the reasons described in the email I sent on March 9. Again, I 
understand from 
that the best way forward is to just get copies of the materials in their original formats, which I 
understand will be segregated and designated by device. That should work for us! I was just trying to understand the 
approach, as well as the timeline. 
thanks,

Just to be clear. The US Attorney's Office (or it's contractors) are not "processing" anything. You are taking files 
that I will be extracting from processed evidence and putting them into an E-Discovery tool (Relativity) to do a 
taint review. 
Relativity is NOT a forensic tool. It is incapable of dealing with many things that are found forensically on a 
computer like free space, slack space, and system files to name a few. When we started this, and you insisted 
you do the taint review in Relativity, I warned you that it was adding months worth of work on top of what was 
already done, and that Relativity was incapable of viewing everything. You insisted we do it this way. So now 
and I have come up with a way to fit this round peg into this square hole. We will get it done. 
Sorry it has taken so long, but we are talking about terabytes worth of data over multiple forms of digital 
evidence. Phones, tablets, loose media, cameras, DVRs, servers, laptops, and desktop computers. We have 
gotten past encryption on multiple devices. When we review devices on such large cases, we usually do it piece 
by piece as things are processed, I was unaware that you didn't want to review as things were processed, that 
you wanted to do it "all at once", so that added to the delay. Sorry for that. Just a differentiation of 
methodology I suppose. 
and I feel confident that the method we have come up with will be more consistent and preserve the 
attribution of files to devices and links of e-mails to attachments that the load file generation that I did a while 
back was lacking.

Okay, so just to check, you both think that there is not a need to do a test run? You're both comfortable with just basically 
sending us copies of everything? I don't totally understand why we couldn't have done that eight months ago, but 
regardless of the passage of time, I want to make sure we understand so we can report to our supervisors. I assume that 
means that we (at the U.S. Attorney's Office and through contractors) will therefore need to do all the processing 
ourselves, correct? And thanks again to you both.

Like 
said in his earlier email. It will be the raw data and it will be marked so it is easier to attribute it to a 
particular device. Problem now is how to get the data to

make sure it transfers correctly, before sending over literally everything — is that still the plan?

Unfortunately I don't think this is very helpful to us. Did you take a look at the example spreadsheet I sent on 2/24? The 
excel file you sent has descriptions that don't match up to the items listed in the search warrant returns (that we sent on 
EFTA00016443
--- PAGE 8 ---
2/23), and we don't have the 1B or CART numbers to be able to cross-reference. We also can't tell what you mean by 
"loose media" without a specific comparison to what was seized, we don't know which items you're referring to as 
"Windows machines," and we can't tell whether the entirety of any particular item has been transferred, or just partial. 
For example, it looks like we have gotten very, very few image files, which is surprising. 
We have also encountered some very significant problems in trying to review the more than 1 million documents we 
recently received: 
The data we've received has no way to put any emails and attachments together. So if an email says, "see the 
attached flight records," for example, we have no way of linking that up with the records themselves. Not only is 
that a big problem for us in review, it's going to be a huge problem for producing the documents to defense 
counsel. 
The load file has no link to the native file, so when we load the data to the database, there's no way to have the 
native files show up in the database. Because many of the files are too large to open in the viewer, it effectively 
means that there are many files that are completely invisible to us. 
Related, the control numbers in the load file don't match up to the native files. So we have two sets of numbers 
and no way to match up anything—that is, even if we were to try to go hunt down every individual large file in the 
native files, it would be impossible. 
So the data that we most recently got, we need to get in a form that addresses those issues, and we likely will need to get 
a similar reproduction of the data we received a couple months ago. Otherwise we're sifting through more than a million 
documents without much rhyme or reason. 
I've re-attached the spreadsheet we sent last week — I think that's a good place to start in terms of our necessary record-
keeping, and we need that info at the very least, as well as anything else you think would be useful. Also attaching the SW 
returns for reference. And again, we're happy to meet up anytime and hash all this out in person if that's useful.

Here is a listing of what I have already handed over in load files to the US Attorney's Office for taint review. Some points of 
clarification: There were 9 IDE hard drives found in the Manhattan apartment, they turned out to be 3 copies of 3 drives 
(9 drives in total) from a July 2007 search on one of his properties. I only processed 3 (as they were all copies). All the 
loose media from the NY apartment is included. All the Windows machines from the NY apartment are included. Only 2 
Macs from NY and 1 from the Island are included. 
I will have to more closely coordinate with whoever is loading up Relativity with the remaining Macs as the tool 
they have to be processed with does not easily re-name the load files. 
Spreadsheet is attached.

what I think would be most helpful to facilitate that would be a spreadsheet of each separate device referenced in the two

transferred, what portions were transferred, etc. 
Something roughly like the attached, with any other categories you think would be useful — and the info on the attached is 
mostly hypothetical, obviously, just as examples. That will help us fully understand what's been reviewed, transferred, 
and received so far, and what remains. 
(Also just on the pictures, we do want copies of those as well, please including from the discs and the devices — I think FBI

Sony for the delayed response. They are tearing out our old network and giving us a new one, they mandated we 
delete old stuff (about 400 TB worth). Now that they are working on replacing the network, we can do only local 
work. I should be able to give you an accounting of what is what. I can say, off the top of my head, that all 
windows based items from the NY search have been handed over as well as all loose media. The CDs from NY 
only contained pictures, no documents. There are still some Apple items from NY that need to be produced. As 
far as the Island stuff goes, the 1st item on your spreadsheet, the "kitchen" mac has been produced. Still working

Based on the attached search warrant returns, it looks like from the New York mansion (the PDF) there are approximately 
devices that would have storage (computers, hard drives, thumb drives, etc.) and that's not even counting at least 60+

I'm not sure who's the exact right person to ask this, so wanted to get everybody on one email chain about it — I have the 
hard drive that 
dropped off that has new Epstein search warrant materials, but it looks like there are also old 
materials (that I think we had previously received and uploaded??) on the hard drive, and so I'm not sure what's new. 
Just generally, and 
and I talked about this last week too, but it's basically impossible for us to keep track of what 
we're getting, and what has been completed, without some kind of identification or labeling system, along with a list of 
which devices have been extracted and downloaded. 
So for example on the hard drive currently, there are 38 folders labeled "loadFiles" through "37loadFiles" with a modified 
date of 11/14/19, which I think we may have already previously received — but I'm not sure, because we haven't gotten 
any info on which folders match up to which devices, etc. And then there's another folder titled "NYC024362" that has a 
modified date of 1/27/20, so I think that may be the materials we hadn't previously received? That folder by itself has 
more than 600,000 items. 
I don't want to give 
anything that we've already previously received and uploaded, and I can't tell from the folder or 
file names whether everything on the drive is new, or whether just additional materials were saved onto it in addition to 
what we already have. =, 
are you able to give us some guidance on this? Ultimately what we really need is a 
spreadsheet of every device, whether it's been dumped (or partially dumped), and then identifying that same info —
which device, and what materials from it — are being given to us with each data transfer. Otherwise I think

Last month, the 11th Circuit, in a case arising from the failure to prosecute Jeffrey Epstein, 
decided that rights under the Crime Victims' Rights Act (the "CVRA") "do not attach until 
criminal proceedings have been initiated against a defendant, either by complaint, information, or 
indictment." In re Wild, 955 F.3d 1196, 1198 (11th Cir. 2020). Accordingly, "[b]ecause the 
government never filed charges or otherwise commenced criminal proceedings against Epstein," 
but simply entered into a non-prosecution agreement with him, "the CVRA was never triggered."

Now that we have completed our responsiveness review in the "US v Epstein (SW Returns)" database, we need to lock off 
access to any non-responsive materials in that database. Would it be possible to please lock off access to the 397,365 
documents in that database that are NOT currently tagged "Identified Responsive"? That should leave just the 1,218,719

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
United States of America, 
—v—
Ghislaine Maxwell, 
Defendant. 
USDC SONY 
DOCUMENT 
ELECTRONICALLY FILED 
DOC 0: 
DATE FILED: 11/11/21 
20-CR-330 (MN) 
OPINION & ORDER 
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
Before the Court is the Defense's motion to exclude the Government's expert witness, 
Dr. Lisa Rocchio, pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 702 and the standard in Daubert v. 
Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993). Dkt. No. 386. The Government filed 
a response brief, Dkt. No. 397, and Defendant filed a reply, Dkt. No. 398. The Court conducted 
a Daubert hearing on November 10, 2021, at which both parties examined Dr. Rocchio. Dkt. 
No. 431. The Court stated its oral opinion at that hearing that it would deny and grant in part 
Defendant's motion, to be followed by this opinion. 
I. 
Legal standard 
Federal Rule of Evidence 702 governs the admissibility of expert testimony. That rule 
states: 
A witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or 
education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if: 
(a) the expert's scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help the trier 
of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue; 
I 
EFTA00016471
--- PAGE 2 ---
(b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data; 
(c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and 
(d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case. 
The Court exercises a "gatekeeper function" in assessing the admissibility of expert 
testimony. Restivo v. Hessernann, 846 F.3d 547, 575 (2d Cir. 2017). To determine whether an 
expert's method is reliable, the Court considers the non-exhaustive list provided by the Supreme 
Court in Daubers, including whether the expert's method has been tested, whether it has been 
subjected to peer review, the rate of error, standards controlling the method's operation, and 
whether the method is accepted by the expert community. United States v. Kidd, 385 F. Supp. 3d 
259, 263 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (citing Daubers, 509 U.S. at 593-94). 
But Rule 702 ultimately sets a "liberal" and "permissive" standard of admissibility. 
Nimely v. City of New York, 414 F.3d 381, 395-96 (2d Cir. 2005). In particular, not every expert 
admissible under Daubers need rely on a method that conforms with "the exactness of hard 
science methodologies." E.E.O.C. v. Bloomberg L.P., No. 07-CV-8383 (LAP), 2010 WL 
3466370, at *13-14 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 31, 2010) (quoting United States v. Simmons, 470 F.3d 
1115, 1123 (5th Cir. 2006)). 
IL 
Discussion 
As a preliminary matter, the Defense argues that the additional materials filed by the 
Government in support of Dr. Rocchio's expertise should be excluded as failing to comply with 
the Court's order that the Government make all expert witness disclosures by April 23, 2021. 
Dkt. No. 250. But that Order, made pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16(a)(1)(G), 
required only that the Government provide an adequate summary of the intended topics and 
opinions of Dr. Rocchio's testimony, which the Government did here in a timely manner. See 
EFTA00016472
--- PAGE 3 ---
Kidd, 385 F. Supp. 3d at 262. The Defense cites only one case, United States v. Lewis, which 
involved the distinct situation where a district court excluded expert testimony because the notice 
itself was untimely. 818 F. App'x 74, 79 (2d Cir. 2020). The Court concludes that the 
Government's supplemental materials in further response to the Defense's motion are timely and 
may be considered in resolving the Daubert motion. 
Turning to the proffered expert opinions, as articulated in the Government's disclosure 
and at the Daubert hearing, Dr. Rocchio would offer five expert opinions. First, that perpetrators 
of sexual abuse of minors frequently use manipulation or coercion short of physical force as part 
of a strategic pattern, often referred to as grooming, to make the minor vulnerable to abuse. 
Second, that manipulation and grooming can prevent the minor from understanding their 
experience as abuse and so prevent disclosure. Third, that abuse can cause long-term traumatic 
and psychological consequences. Fourth, that the presence of another individual can facilitate 
sexual abuse of minors. And fifth, that nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and secrecy are 
common among victims of sexual abuse and that memory can be affected by a variety of factors, 
including the effects of trauma. 
The Defense does not contest that Dr. Rocchio has the qualifications to express opinions 
on these subjects. Dr. Rocchio has a PhD in clinical psychology and is a clinical instructor at the 
Alpert Medical School of Brown University. She has more than two decades of experience 
treating hundreds of victims of trauma, many of which were minor victims of sexual abuse. She 
has published peer-reviewed articles on trauma and sexual abuse and has given numerous talks in 
addition to her teaching. Given these papers, and her credible and extensive hearing testimony, 
the Court therefore finds Dr. Rocchio qualified as an expert. 
EFTA00016473
--- PAGE 4 ---
The Defense instead argues that Dr. Rocchio's method is unreliable, that it is not relevant 
to the jury's determination, and that its prejudicial effect would substantially outweigh its 
probative value. These arguments rely heavily on a district court opinion from outside this 
circuit, United States v. Raymond, 700 F. Supp. 2d 142 (D. Me. 2010). After careful 
consideration of the Defense's arguments and the thorough reasoning in Raymond, the Court 
concludes that Dr. Rocchio's anticipated testimony is admissible with one exception. The Court 
will address first why Dr. Rocchio's testimony is admissible and then address the one opinion 
that it will exclude. 
First, Dr. Rocchio's method is reliable and well-accepted in her profession. It is for this 
reason that several courts in this circuit have admitted the testimony of similar experts, such as 
testimony on so-called trauma bonding to explain why prostitutes may not flee from their pimps 
even when not physically restrained. In United States v. Kidd, the court admitted the testimony, 
finding it to be "quite common[ ]" and accepted in the academic literature. 385 F. Supp. 3d at 
263. Identical testimony was admitted by Judge Furman in United States v. Dupigny, No. 18-
Cr.-528 (JMF) (S.D.N.Y. 2019), Dkt. No. 198 at 27, by Judge Engelmayer in United States v. 
Randall, 19 Cr. 131 (PAE) (S.D.N.Y. 2020), Dkt. No. 335 at 24-30, and by Judge Cote in United 
States v. Torres, No. 20-CR-608 (DLC), 2021 WL 1947503, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. May 13, 2021). 
Their decisions are consistent with the vast majority of courts to consider the admission 
of such experts. A number of courts have admitted experts on the particular topic of grooming at 
issue here, a sample of which include the Seventh Circuit in United States v. Romero, 189 F.3d 
576, 585 (7th Cir. 1999), the Fifth Circuit in United States v. Hitt, 473 F.3d 146, 158 (5th Cir. 
2006), the Ninth Circuit in United States v. Halamek, 5 F.4th 1081, 1087-89 (9th Cir. 2021), the 
Tenth Circuit in United States v. Batton, 602 F.3d 1191, 1201-02 (10th Cir. 2010), the Eighth 
EFTA00016474
--- PAGE 5 ---
Circuit in United States v. Johnson, 860 F.3d 1133, 1141 (8th Cir. 2017), and the District of 
Massachusetts in Doe ex rel. Pike v. Pike, 405 F. Supp. 3d 243, 249 (D. Mass. 2019). 
Here, Dr. Rocchio has extensive experience treating minors who have been sexually 
abused, and those decades of relevant experience, combined with her formal training, are an 
adequate basis for her to testify on methods that perpetrators of sexual abuse often use to build 
trust with their victims, whether that be grooming or other forms of manipulation and coercion. 
The Government has also provided several articles on the subject of grooming that convince the 
Court that it is a well-accepted theory in Dr. Rocchio's field. Though the Second Circuit has not 
ruled on the admissibility of a grooming expert, it has previously recognized the academic 
literature on grooming to facilitate sexual abuse of minors. See United States v. Brand, 467 F.3d 
179, 203 (2d Cir. 2006). The Defense cites to several contrary articles that suggest experts 
disagree on the kinds of behaviors that define grooming. But if experts disagree on the proper 
interpretation of evidence, "it is not the Court's role to resolve the dispute through exclusion of 
one of the expert's opinions." In re Digital Musk Antitrust Litig., 321 F.R.D. 64, 80 (S.D.N.Y. 
2017). 
Moreover, Dr. Rocchio addressed these contrary articles during the Daubert hearing, 
identifying points of agreement and disagreement. Based on her testimony, the parties' 
submission and accompanying exhibits, the Court concludes that the core concept of grooming is 
well-accepted in the relevant literature, even if experts continue to debate the details. 
The Defense's primary argument is that Dr. Rocchio's method is unreliable because it is 
based on her personal experience with the clients she has treated, that Dr. Rocchio did not verify 
whether those clients were truthful, and that Dr. Rocchio has not and cannot identify an error 
rate. The Court finds that these objections are misplaced in the field of clinical psychology, 
EFTA00016475
--- PAGE 6 ---
particularly when studying the causes and effects of sexual abuse of minors. The Court agrees 
with Judge Engelmayer's response to this argument: 
The absence of large quantity statistical studies is explained by a practical reason 
that should be obvious to all. Studying the circumstances and psychological 
drivers of trafficked women is not like studying diseases or potential cures in 
laboratory animals. In those studies, laboratory conditions literally can be 
achieved.. . . 
That strictly quantitative mode of inquiry is not realistic or even ethical in the 
context of studying sex trafficking. The causes and contributors to sex trafficking 
by their nature must be studied retrospectively. They cannot ethically be studied 
otherwise. Subjects cannot be tested to see under what circumstances they would 
and would not, on a going forward basis, fall prey to the predations of sex 
traffickers. Given the necessarily retrospective nature of such a study, given the 
small size of the populations under review, and given the inherently 
individualized circumstances presented by different perpetrators, victims, and 
contexts in this tumultuous and emotionally fraught area of criminal conduct, the 
vocabulary of error rates and statistical significance is an unusually poor fit. 
Tr. at 29-30, United States v. Randall, 19-Cr.-131 (PAE) (S.D.N.Y. 2020), Dkt. No. 335. 
For the reasons Judge Engelmayer gave—which Dr. Rocchio echoed in her testimony—
the Court finds that the error-rate factor listed by Daubert is not determinative as to the reliability 
of Dr. Rocchio's method. 
For similar reasons, the Court rejects the Defense's argument that Dr. Rocchio's method 
is unreliable because she relied on the reports of her clients. Given the realities of studying 
sensitive criminal acts like sexual abuse, a researcher can only rarely verify reports with absolute 
certainty. Yet that does not mean a clinical or forensic psychologist accepts all statements at 
face value. Rather, as the Government notes, part of Dr. Rocchio's profession is to examine and 
diagnose her patients consistent with her significant training and specialized knowledge. 
Further, on the forensic side of her practice, Dr. Rocchio regularly investigates and verifies 
sexual abuse. She reports "remarkable consistency" between the reports of her clinical patients 
EFTA00016476
--- PAGE 7 ---
and her forensic findings. Nov. 10 Tr. at 40. That said, the Defense is of course free to cross-
examine Dr. Rocchio about how she evaluates her patients. 
The Defense also suggests that Dr. Rocchio's experience is based on an unrepresentative 
sample of alleged victims because her patients self-selected seeking treatment with her. Yet the 
Defense does not explain why Dr. Rocchio's experience with a large number of patients would 
not be applicable to the alleged victims in this case. To the extent the Defense wishes to argue 
that Dr. Rocchio's experience is under-representative, that is a topic for cross-examination. 
Further, the Defense argues that Dr. Rocchio's experience treating victims of sexual 
abuse does not make her an expert on grooming, which would require experience with 
perpetrators themselves. This argument overlooks the fact that, as she testified, Dr. Rocchio also 
relied on literature that includes studies of sexual abusers' reported behaviors. But more 
importantly, the Court concludes, as other courts like the Ninth Circuit have, that extensive 
experience with victims can be used to study perpetrators' process of victimization. See 
Halamek, 5 F.4th at 1088. That is especially so here where the crux of Dr. Rocchio's expected 
testimony is the effect that grooming behaviors have on the minor, not the perpetrator's mental 
state when performing the behaviors. 
Second, the Court finds that Dr. Rocchio's opinions are relevant to the Government's 
case against Ms. Maxwell. Two points of law bear mention here. For one, as the Second Circuit 
has explained, expert testimony cannot "constitute evaluations of witness credibility"—that is, 
expert testimony is inadmissible if it "comment[s] directly, under the guise of expert opinion, on 
the credibility of trial testimony from" specific fact witnesses. Nimely, 414 F.3d at 398. 
Additionally, if the expert's "opinion is one that the jury could reach with their own `common 
knowledge and common sense,' no expert testimony is warranted." Edmondson v. RCI Hosp. 
EFTA00016477
--- PAGE 8 ---
Holdings, Inc., No. 16-CV-2242 (VEC), 2020 WL 1503452, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 30, 2020) 
(quoting 4 Weinstein's Federal Evidence § 702.03 (2019)); see also United States v. Mulder, 273 
F.3d 91, 101 (2d Cir. 2001) (explaining that "the district court should not admit testimony that is 
'directed solely to lay matters which a jury is capable of understanding and deciding without the 
expert's help' (quoting United States v. Castillo, 924 F.2d 1227, 1232 (2d Cir. 1991))). Dr. 
Rocchio's first and second opinions may assist the jury in understanding how a minor may be 
enticed, induced, or coerced into illegal sexual activity without physical force. These opinions 
may also assist a jury in assessing evidence that some alleged victims repeatedly interacted with 
Jeffrey Epstein, seemingly voluntarily, even after they suffered abuse. Dr. Rocchio's fourth 
opinion is similarly relevant to the charges that require proving intentional enticement or 
inducement. 
Dr. Rocchio's third and fifth opinions pertain to issues that will arise in the case based on 
anticipated cross-examination by the Defense. Specifically, the third opinion becomes relevant if 
the Defense impeaches an alleged victim based on their substance abuse. And the fifth opinion 
may become relevant if the Defense impeaches an alleged victim based on an ostensible delay in 
fully disclosing sexual abuse. At the Daubert hearing, the Defense stated that they intended to 
pursue both lines of impeachment at trial. Nov. 10 Tr. at 156-57. The Court therefore finds 
these elements of Dr. Rocchio's testimony relevant to matters the Defense intends to put in issue 
during anticipated cross-examination. The Court also concludes that these opinions satisfy the 
other relevant Daubert requirements. Namely, they would assist the jury in understanding 
concepts that require expert knowledge without directing the jury to reach any conclusion as to a 
witness's credibility. Additionally, both Dr. Rocchio's opinion about sexual abuse's connection 
to substance abuse and her opinion about delayed disclosure are "are outside the ken of the 
EFTA00016478
--- PAGE 9 ---
average person," and so appropriate for expert testimony. United States v. Felder, 993 F.3d 57, 
(2d Cir. 2021). Nor would admission of these opinions cause unfair Rule 403 prejudice since 
they are relevant rebuttal to impeachment points that the Defense will put in issue. 
The Defense argues that Dr. Rocchio's testimony is not relevant because the Government 
represents that she will testify only to general principles and not offer "testimony regarding any 
specific victim." Dkt. No. 386 at 3. The Defense has the law backwards on this point. As 
explained above regarding the Second Circuit's Nimely decision, an expert may not testify as to a 
specific witness's credibility. 414 F.3d at 398. And as other courts have explained in admitting 
similar testimony, Dr. Rocchio's testimony is appropriate because she does not testify as to any 
specific witness's credibility. See, e.g., Torres, No. 20-CR-608 (DLC), 2021 WL 1947503, at 
*7; Johnson, 860 F.3d at 1140 (8th Cir. 2017) (explaining that an expert may testify "regarding 
the general characteristics that sexually abused children exhibit" but may not usurp the jury's 
role of assessing the credibility of any specific victim); United States v. Telles, 6 F.4th 1086, 
1097-98 (9th Cir. 2021) (same). 
This analysis is referred to in the case relied upon by the Defense, United States v. 
Raymond, and in portions of the Defense's briefing, as a question of "fit." 700 F. Supp. 2d at 
149. But Daubert's "fit" requirement is really just a specialized relevance inquiry that asks 
"whether expert testimony proffered in the case is sufficiently tied to the facts of the case that it 
will aid the jury in resolving a factual dispute." Alto v. Sun Pharm. Indus., Inc., No. 1:19-CV-
09758 (GHW), 2021 WL 4803582, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 13, 2021) (quoting Daubert, 509 U.S. at 
591). Fit is satisfied if the expert's opinion would assist the jury's decision on a relevant 
question of fact without "usurp[ing] either the role of the trial judge in instructing the July as to 
the applicable law or the role of the jury in applying that law to the facts before it." Id. (quoting 
EFTA00016479
--- PAGE 10 ---
United States v. Duncan, 42 F.3d 97, 101 (2d Cir. 1994)). For the reasons already provided, the 
Court finds that fit is satisfied here. 
Third, the probative value of Dr. Rocchio's testimony is not substantially outweighed by 
403 prejudice to Ms. Maxwell. The Court finds that Dr. Rocchio's testimony would not unduly 
"'simplify' an otherwise complex case" or mislead jurors by a supposedly infallible expert. Dkt. 
No. 386 at II. Dr. Rocchio's opinions speak only to concepts and will not (and indeed may not) 
suggest that the jury find any alleged victim witness to be credible or to find Ms. Maxwell guilty. 
The more general nature of Dr. Rocchio's opinions, which the Court heard in detail at the 
Daubert hearing, therefore mitigates its prejudicial effect. Telles, 6 F.4th at 1097. It is the jury's 
role to determine whether and how Dr. Rocchio's opinions apply to the facts of this case and the 
credibility of the witnesses. 
Last, as previously mentioned, the Court will grant in part the Defense's Daubert motion. 
The Defense argues that Dr. Rocchio's opinion that grooming can be done to facilitate sexual 
abuse by a third party or that the presence of a third party can otherwise facilitate grooming is 
unreliable. The Defense calls this "grooming-by-proxy." E.g., Dkt. No. 386 at 9. Terminology 
aside, the Court agrees with this narrower objection to Dr. Rocchio's testimony. As discussed at 
the hearing, this phenomenon is not identified in the relevant literature regarding child sexual 
abuse and has not been subjected to peer review. Instead, the Court understands this opinion to 
be an extrapolation of the broader principle of how grooming functions through the development 
of trust. That extrapolation may be logical and follow common sense, but it is for the jury to 
make on the facts of this case. The Court therefore excludes Dr. Rocchio's opinion that the 
presence of a third party can facilitate grooming. Dr. Rocchio's core opinions about grooming, 
however, remain admissible under the Rule 702 and Daubert standard and remain relevant 
EFTA00016480
--- PAGE 11 ---
pursuant to Rule 401 and not unduly prejudicial. As discussed, the jury may extrapolate from the 
opinions that the presence of a third party creates the atmosphere of trust that can facilitate 
grooming. Moreover, as the Government explains, Dr. Rocchio's testimony is still relevant 
because the Government alleges both that Ms. Maxwell "in fact participated in sexual abuse of 
minors" and that she "conspired with a predator who groomed and sexually abused minors." 
Dkt. No. 397 at 27. 
The Court therefore denies the Defense's motion to exclude Dr. Rocchio's testimony 
except as to the opinion that the presence of a third party can facilitate grooming. 
This resolves docket number 386.

*OFF-THE-RECORD, AND FOR GUIDANCE ONLY: Several of the government's anticipated witnesses will be testifying in 
this trial using a pseudonym or first name. The Court granted a Government motion (attached) requesting that they 
be able to do so, because the victim witnesses are expected to describe alleged sensitive, explicit and personal events 
concerning illegal sexual abuse, sexual contact and other acts of which they have been victims. I believe most, if not 
all, news media outlets have a policy against identifying sex crime victims without their consent, and urge you to 
abide by that policy with our witnesses and respect their privacy. 
9:30 a.m. — Final pretrial conference U.S. v. Ghislaine Maxwell — the defendant is charged in connection to conspiring

Letter to preclude cross attached. er 
our conversation, I left blanks for the facts of MV-1 and MV-2's drug

20cr330, United States v. Maxwell 
DRAFT — November 23, 2021 
I 
Preliminary Instructions to the Sworn Jury 
Order of Trial 
Now that you have been sworn, let me give you some instructions about 
your duties as jurors. At the end of the trial I will give you more detailed 
instructions, and those instructions will control your deliberations in this case. But 
for now, let me explain how the trial will proceed. 
The first step in the trial will be opening statements. The government will 
make an opening statement. After that, I expect the lawyers for the defendant to 
make an opening statement as well. Those statements are not evidence. They 
serve no purpose other than to give you an idea in advance of the evidence that the 
lawyers expect you to hear from the witnesses. Those statements permit the 
lawyers to tell you a little bit of what the case is all about, but the only evidence 
comes from the witnesses and the exhibits. 
After opening statements, the government will present its evidence. The 
government's evidence will consist of the testimony of witnesses as well as 
documents and exhibits. The government will examine the witnesses, and then the 
defendant's lawyers may cross-examine them. Following the government's case, 
the defendant may present a case if she wishes. Again, because of the presumption 
of innocence, the defendant is not required to offer any proof. If the defendant 
EFTA00016498
--- PAGE 3 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 497 Filed 11/23/21 Page 3 of 11 
I 
does present a defense case, the defense witnesses will testify, and the government 
will have the opportunity to cross-examine them. 
After the presentation of evidence is completed, the parties will deliver their 
closing arguments to summarize and interpret the evidence. Just as the parties' 
opening statements are not evidence, their closing arguments are not evidence 
either. 
Following closing arguments, I will instruct you on the law. Then, you will 
retire to deliberate on your verdict, which must be unanimous and must be based 
on the evidence or lack of evidence presented at trial. Your deliberations are 
secret. You will never have to explain your verdict to anyone. 
As I've told you, under the law, a defendant in a criminal case is presumed 
innocent and cannot be found guilty of the crimes charged unless a jury, after 
having heard all of the evidence in the case, unanimously decides that the evidence 
proves the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. 
In a criminal case the burden of proof remains with the prosecution — the 
government. For the jury to return a verdict of guilty as to the defendant, the 
government must prove that the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. A 
person charged with a crime has absolutely no burden to prove that she is not 
guilty, and if the defendant chooses not to present any proof, that decision cannot 
be held against her and may not enter into your deliberations at all. I will, 
EFTA00016499
--- PAGE 4 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 497 Filed 11/23/21 Page 4 of 11 
I 
however, instruct you fully on the burden of proof after all of the evidence has 
been received. 
The Judge's and Jury's Role 
Now, let me explain the jobs that you and I are to perform during the trial. I 
will decide which rules of law apply to this case. I will decide that by making 
legal rulings during the presentation of the evidence, and also — as I told you — in 
giving the final instructions to you after the evidence and arguments are completed. 
In order to do my job, I may have to interrupt the proceedings from time to 
time to confer with the parties about the rules of law that should apply here. 
Sometimes we will talk here, at the bench, outside of your hearing. But some of 
these conferences may take more time than others, so, as a convenience to you, I 
may excuse you from the courtroom. I will try to avoid such interruptions as much 
as possible, but please be patient and understand that these conferences are 
necessary to ensure the fairness of the trial and often make the trial go faster. 
While I decide the law that applies to this case, you, ladies and gentlemen of 
the jury, are the triers of fact. You will weigh the evidence presented and decide 
whether the government has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant 
is guilty of the charges in the indictment. You must pay close attention to all of the 
EFTA00016500
--- PAGE 5 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 497 Filed 11/23/21 Page 5 of 11 
evidence presented, and you must base your decision only on the evidence in the 
case and my instructions about the law. 
What Is and Isn't Evidence 
What, then, is evidence? Evidence consists only of the testimony of 
witnesses, documents and other things admitted as evidence, or stipulations agreed 
to by the parties. Some of you probably have heard the terms "circumstantial 
evidence" and "direct evidence." Do not be concerned with these terms. You are 
to consider all the evidence given in this trial. 
Certain things are not evidence and must not be considered by you. The 
following is a list of what is not evidence: 
First, arguments, statements, and questions by the lawyers are not evidence. 
Nor are statements I make or questions I ask of a witness. 
Second, objections to questions are not evidence. The lawyers have an 
obligation to make an objection when they believe evidence being offered is 
In 
improper under the rules of evidence. You should not be influenced by the 
objection or by my rulings on them. If the objection is sustained, ignore the 
question and any answer that may have been given. If it is overruled, treat the 
answer like any other. If you are instructed that some item of evidence is received 
for a limited purpose only, you must follow that instruction. 
EFTA00016501
--- PAGE 6 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 497 Filed 11/23/21 Page 6 of 11 
I 
Third, testimony that I have excluded or told you to disregard is not 
evidence and must not be considered. 
Fourth, anything you may have seen or heard outside the courtroom is not 
evidence and must be disregarded. You are to decide the case solely on the 
evidence presented here in the courtroom. 
Evaluating the Evidence 
There is no formula to evaluate testimony or exhibits. For now, suffice it to 
say that you bring with you into this courtroom all of the experience and 
background of your lives. Do not leave your common sense outside the courtroom. 
The same types of tests that you use in your everyday dealings are the tests that 
you should apply in deciding how much weight, if any, to give to the evidence in 
this case. 
The law does not require you to accept all of the evidence admitted at trial. 
IS 
In determining what evidence you accept, you must make your own evaluation of 
In 
the testimony from each of the witnesses and the exhibits that are received in 
evidence. 
It is essential, however, that you keep an open mind until you have heard all 
of the evidence in the case. A case can be presented only step by step, witness by 
witness, before all evidence is before you. 
EFTA00016502
--- PAGE 7 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 497 Filed 11/23/21 Page 7 of 11 
I 
As you know from experience, you can hear one person give his or her 
version of an event and think it sounds very impressive or even compelling, and 
yet, upon hearing another person's version of the same event — or even the same 
person cross-examined with respect to the event — things may seem very different. 
In other words, there may be another side to any witness's story. 
You should use your common sense and good judgment to evaluate each 
witness's testimony based on all of the circumstances. Again, I cannot emphasize 
too strongly that you must keep an open mind until the trial is over. You should 
not reach any conclusions until you have all the evidence before you. 
As I mentioned during jury selection, this case has received, and will 
t 
continue to receive, significant attention in the media. To protect their privacy, I 
have permitted witnesses, if they choose, to be referred to in open court by either 
their first name or a pseudonym. The full names of the witnesses are known to the 
Government, the defendant, and to the Court, and were shown to you during jury 
I5 
selection. This process should not bear in any way on your evaluation of the 
evidence in this case. 
EFTA00016503

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 497 Filed 11/23/21 Page 8 of 11 
i 
Rules of Conduct 
Finally, let me caution you about certain rules and principles governing your 
conduct as jurors in this case. First, you must not talk to each other about this case 
or about anyone who has anything to do with it until the end of the case when you 
go to the jury room to decide your verdict. The reason for this requirement is that 
you must not reach any conclusion on the charges until all of the evidence is in. 
As I have said, keep an open mind until you start your deliberations at the end of 
the case. 
Second, do not communicate with anyone else about this case or about 
anyone who has anything to do with it until the trial has ended and you have been 
discharged as jurors. Anyone else includes members of your family and your 
friends. And no communicating about the case means no communicating on your 
cell phone, iPhone, Blackberry, text messaging, websites, internet chat rooms, 
email, social media websites or applications (including Facebook, Instagram, 
Twitter, Linkedln, YouTube, Reddit, etc.) — or by any other means. I know in this 
day and age there is temptation to look to these devices or means of 
communication, but with your oath you are making a commitment to resist that 
temptation. You may tell your family and friends that you are a juror in a criminal 
case, but you may not tell them anything else about it until you have been 
discharged by me. 
EFTA00016504
--- PAGE 9 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 497 Filed 11/23/21 Page 9 of 11 
Third, do not let anyone talk to you about the case or about anyone who has 
anything to do with it. If any person should attempt to communicate with you 
about this case at any time throughout the trial, either in or out of the courthouse, 
you must immediately report that to my Deputy, Ms. Williams, and to no one else. 
Ms. Williams will report it to me. When I say report that communication to no one 
else, I mean that you should not tell anyone, including your fellow jurors. 
To minimize the probability of any such improper communication, it is 
important that you go straight to the jury room when you come in in the morning 
and that you remain in the jury room for the duration of the trial day. You should 
not linger in the public areas of the courthouse, on this floor or elsewhere on your 
way in and out. 
Fourth, do not do any research or any investigation about the case or about 
anyone who has anything to with the case on your own. Don't go visit any place 
described in the trial. Don't read or listen to or watch any news reports about the 
case. Don't go on the internet or use whatever digital or communications device it 
is you use to see what you can learn to inform yourself about this matter. 
Again, I know that in this day and age, there is temptation, but as I have 
made clear throughout the process so far, this rule is very very important. That is 
because your decision in this case must be made solely on the evidence or lack of 
evidence presented at the trial. In other words, all that you need to know will be 
EFTA00016505
--- PAGE 10 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 497 Filed 11/23/21 Page 10 of 11 
I 
presented here in open court by the parties. This is critically important to ensuring 
a fair trial — which I know that all of you would want if you were a party in this 
Court and I have no doubt is what you want for the parties who are here today. I 
expect you to inform me immediately through Ms. Williams if you become aware 
of another juror's violation of these instructions. 
Finally, each of you has been given a notebook and pen. That is because I 
permit jurors to take notes. But you do not have to take notes. Notes are just an 
aid to your own recollection. The court reporters in this case record everything 
that is said in the courtroom and any portion of the testimony can be read back to 
you during your deliberations. If you do take notes, be aware that note-taking may 
distract you from something important that is happening on the witness stand. 
Whether or not you take notes, rely on your own recollections, and don't be 
; 
influenced by the fact that another juror has taken notes. If you do take notes, all 
notes must be left each day in the jury room. Ms. Williams will make sure that 
they are secure. 
From this point until the time when you retire to deliberate, it is your duty 
not to discuss this case with anyone and not to remain in the presence of other 
persons who may be discussing this case—this includes discussions even with 
members of your own family, and your friends. In this regard, please understand 
that the parties and counsel in this case have been instructed to have no contact 
EFTA00016506
--- PAGE 11 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 497 Filed 11/23/21 Page 11 of 11 
I 
with any of you, not even to offer a friendly greeting. So if you happen to see any 
of them outside this courtroom, and they do not acknowledge you, say hello, or 
make small talk, please do not take offense. They are not being rude — they are 
simply following my instructions. 
Conclusion 
That concludes my preliminary instructions to you. Now we will begin with 
the initial stage of the case, which, as I said to you, is opening statements, and we 
are going to begin with the government. 
Let me just note, as I said in the beginning of jury selection, we are in an 
outfitted courtroom for COVID times. The witness will be in this Plexiglass box 
that has a HEPA filter, and they will remove their mask to testify when we have 
-4 
witnesses testify. The lawyer who will be questioning them and the lawyer during 
opening statements will be in that Plexiglass box with the HEPA filter, and they 
will be permitted to remove their mask while they provide opening statements, as 
I n 
well. 
So at this time I am going to ask all of you to give your undivided attention 
to the lawyers as they make their opening statements.

There are prosecutors who would be afraid to charge a case that would require them to prove sex crimes that took place 
in 1994. If you want to find them, you'll have to go to Florida. This is the Southern District of New York. 
It is never too late for justice. Sometimes, you just have to have faith in the power of the truth and hope twelve jurors will 
do the right thing. At this trial, brave women will take the witness stand and the truth will come out: Ghislaine Maxwell 
sexually exploited underage girls. She caused unspeakable harm to vulnerable kids. It is time to hold her accountable. 
will open in the morning. Please come support. Details below. Updates to follow. 
Main courtroom: 40 Foley, courtroom 318 
Overflow courtrooms: 110, 506, 905, and 906. There is also a conference room on the first floor (room 130) that has a 
very small monitor with a live feed just for our office. 
Timing: we'll start at 8:30 a.m. with peremptory challenges, and we expect to go straight to preliminary instructions and 
opening statements. In order to get a seat, we'd recommend that you go over early.

Now that we have completed our responsiveness review in the "US v Epstein (SW Returns)" database, we need to lock off 
access to any non-responsive materials in that database. Would it be possible to please lock off access to the 397,365 
documents in that database that are NOT currently tagged "Identified Responsive"? That should leave just the 1,218,719 
documents that are tagged "Identified Responsive" accessible to the team for use in our case. 
Happy to have a call to discuss if that would be useful. 
Thanks very much,

guilty and denied the criminal allegations against her, and I fully believe that it is her intent 
and desire to remain in the U.S. to face the ensuing process and to clear her name. 
Over the past few years she has had dozens of alternative places she could have gone, but she 
did not want to be perceived as running or as having done something wrong. She was 
adamant to not only stay in the United States to fi t the smears a • ainst her, but to be within

I pray for Ghislaine's safety. I am praying for justice. And I pray for her constitutionally

With humility and deep compassion, I am also praying for Epstein's victims.

The Honorable Alison J. Nathan 
United States District Court 
Southern District of New York 
United States Courthouse 
Foley Square 
New York, NY 10007 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
I have known Ghislaine 
all her life. 
Ghislaine and I ave a wa s erfoyed 
sharing the personal experience of our lives with each other. 
she was 
full of 'vim and vigor' and always just lovely to be with. 
she and I have seen our 
relationship strengthen through shared common interests. In particular, Ghislaine's passion

EFTA00016533
--- PAGE 3 ---
Throughout her school life Ghislaine 
always had friends and seemed to be genuinely grounded in her love of life and learnin . We 
were all quite proud when she graduated from Oxford with her Bachelor's degree. She, 
learned early on the value of hard work 
Around 1990, Ghislaine came to live in New York to continue 
Maxwell Corporate Gifts, a successful company she had founded in the UK which was 
subsequently absorbed 
in 1991, Ghislaine had to rely on her personal 
compass, inner resilience and sheer determination to build a fresh life for herself. Her prior 
'big picture' experience, top-level entertaining skills and talent for organizing, coupled with 
her multi-cultural and multi-lingual sophistication, opened doors into New York society. 
Although it is true that for many years Ghislaine was frequently involved in high society and 
attended fashionable social gatherings; what irks me greatly is the press's one dimensional 
`socialite' focus on Ghislaine, that completely denies and refuses to acknowledge the very 
serious, highly intellectual and passionate caring sides of Ghislaine. For example, since 2003, 
Ghislaine devoted all her energy, her own financial resources and intellectual skills to helping 
save the Oceans, through her establishment of the not-for-profit company, The Terramar 
Project Ghislaine's deep knowledge and appreciation of the significant role the oceans play 
in our world's fragile ecosystem enabled her to work with key partners to influence the 
United Nations in 2014 in enunciating its Sustainable Development Goal 15 "To conserve 
and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development." 
Indeed, it seemed so clear to me that this mission encompassed her life's passion and offered 
a way for her proactively to give something back of real value to society. 
Ghislaine showed a huge amount of courage and forbearance in the face of great adversity 
and in the years that followed. I have seen this streneth more than ever 
during the times 
Despite the tremendous daily pressures she has been under, notably from the world's media, 
universally hostile to her, she has shown simultaneously a deal of humility and fortitude. She 
has the profoundly deep conviction (through every fibre of her being) of her innocence in the 
face of all the unsupported accusations and criminal charges latterly filed against her. 
To the best of my knowledge and belief, 
Ghislaine has never been brought in for 
questioning, arrested, or charged with any criminal offense by law enforcement until now. 
Notwithstanding the seriousness of the offenses with which she has been charged, as a US 
Citizen, she has the constitutional right to the presumption of innocence and a fair trial. For 
the purpose of increasing their profits by boosting TV ratings and / or newspaper readership, 
the world's media has aired or printed the most heinous accusations against her, in some 
cases for years now, that have never been cross-examined in a criminal court in front of an 
Wage 
EFTA00016534
--- PAGE 4 ---
independent judge and jury. Ghislaine is not a malicious or jealous person. In all the 
I have known her, I have never seen her be violent or act inappropriately against anyone, let 
alone young adults or children as has been alleged. 
I 
believe in her innocence. I know 
s e wou never o anyt mg to put my r e or my ami y s life in jeopardy in any way, which 
is why I have no hesitation in placing the one property that I own — which is my only nest-
egg for my retirement—up as part of her bail application. The value is $1.5 Million dollars. I 
do not have any other savings and it would be completely devastating financially and in every 
irar.in own family were the house to be taken over by the Government due to a breach of 
bail conditions. I know in every fibre of my being that 
Ghislaine will 
never try to flee and will absolutely turn up to her trial, to have the opportunity to fight the 
char es against her. Based on my deep knowledge and experience with Ghislaine 
I totally trust and believe that I do not have to worry in any way about my home eing 
put up as a part of her bail application. 
Until her arrest, I spoke often with Ghislaine over the phone and in the early summer of this 
ear, two to four times a week. 
I witnessed how hard she worked every day and well into the nights going through the 
ever-growing tsunami of press clippings, videos, audio files, etc, that so gravely traduced her 
and continue to do so. Ghislaine is completely horrified and flabbergasted by these 
unfounded and completely horrendous accusations, as indeed am I. 
I feel totally safe around Ghislaine, in fact, I feel safer with her. I have never had any 
hesitation in my children visiting her or being with her — as they have been — both as young 
children and now they are older. Neither they nor I have ever seen any signs or signals of the 
alleged criminal conduct. I personally witnessed her be a warm, lovely, understanding and

impressed by her interaction with them and by their evident trust in and great affection for her 
which was entirely natural and unforced. Every exchan e was totally normal and just lovely 
to watch how each of these 
clearly liked 
and she them. Although 
Ghislaine was certainly part of the New York social scene in the past, for many years, it had 
become clear to me that she was happy in a long-term loving relationship with her previous 
partner of over 7 years far away from the New York scene and with 
leading a happy family life with people she loved and trusted and who were similarly equally 
loving and trustin of her. I saw the same attern of strong domesticity and family happiness 
with her spouse 
I have personally witnessed how much they love 
being with and being oved by Ghislaine.

In terms of character, Ghislaine is com assionate, ca.able and .roactive. Ghislaine is very 
kind and caring. She brought 
to stay with 
her in New York for extended periods so that they could spend quality time together. She 
took them all around the US to see the sights and to visit with family and friends. Even under 
the terrible weight of her present circumstances, she has consistent) demonstrated her 
consideration for others. Whenever we spoke, she asked about

family ties here in this country 
Most of all, her 
own husband 
are here. During the past 18 months in particular Ghislaine has 
gone out of her way to continue to stay in the United States expressly so that she could put 
her case forward in a court of law should it ever come to that. I therefore feel great 
consternation and deep shock and sadness when I hear about the conditions of her present 
incarceration, which include over 150 days of solitary confinement and other extreme 
deprivations and restrictions. The great toll that this physical, mental, and emotional stress is 
taking on 
makes it even more impossible for her to adequately prepare her defence 
from inside jail. 
If she is granted bail, I will be in continuous touch with her during the weeks and months 
leading up to her trial, providing whatever support I can while she has the chance to fairly 
prepare for her upcoming trial and fight for her innocence. 
I am grateful for the opportunity to provide this statement. 
Sincerely,

The Honorable Alison J. Nathan 
United States District Court 
Southern District of New York 
United States Courthouse 
Foley Square 
New York, NY 10007 
Your Honor 
November 23rd 2020 
This statement is in support of Ghislaine Maxwell's request for bail and her 
character. 
M name is 
I write this letter in 
rt o 
Ghislaine Maxwell. 
We remain close and have been in communication by phone and videolink most weeks up 
until her arrest on July 2" 2020; I have historically regularly visited her in the United States 
at least a couple of times a year and she has always caught up with me when she has visited 
the UK or Europe. I have historically and continue to act as one her closest confidants and 
advisors, 
Ghislaine has always faced up to every challenge she has met in her life whether it involved 
or decisions involving 
either her business interests or philanthropic interests. I consider her to be absolutely straight, 
clear and honest in all her dealings with third parties - this attitude applies to her filing her tax 
returns as it does to every other aspect of her life: organised, clear and straight. 
Until these charges, 
has never been involved in any allegation of breaking the law 
in any jurisdiction. 
Speaking for myself, 
can confirm that I stan 
had in 
a so ute y 
er m er 
to c ear er name. 
she has been a constant visitor to my f: 
omes, 
children to stay with her in her homes 
and I would not hesitate to leave any of my kids or grandkids in her care. I have 
never witnessed, nor heard from my children or grandchildren any reports of any 
inappropriate behaviour 
Ghislaine has stayed at all times in the jurisdiction of the Unites States since the new charges 
against the late Jeffrey Epstein and has from the outset confirmed to me personally on 
EFTA00016538
--- PAGE 3 ---
numerous occasions that she wanted to be available to deal with any civil or criminal 
allegations, to confront these and to deal with them in situ. She provided evidence under oath 
in deposition in civil litigation rather than stay silent which is a good illustration of her 
candour. 
From my own experience, I can confirm that Ghislaine is kind, thoughtful and generous 
whether it is helping friends who have fallen on difficult times such as a friend who was 
recently widowed and to whom Ghislaine provided her own home in London immediately; or 
inviting my children and their friends when on their gap year to stay with her and to sort out 
transport, housing and friends to support them on their travels; or whether devoting 
considerable resources and time to her philanthropic activity primarily in oceans 
conservation. 
I have offered to co-sign a bond in the amount of US$3,500,000 where the amount of the 
bond would be secured by properties owned by 
as this 
represents the entirety of realisable family weals 
s in support o 
judgement in relation to Ghislaine's integrity and commitment to attend court an to 
underline that the family would be left without resources in the event that the bond was 
called. 
Yours sincerely 
EFTA00016539

UBS Client Relationship Agreement 
Introduction 
At UBS, we understand that we succeed only when our clients succeed. With that in mind, 
we provide a customized approach to wealth management, built on your personal 
relationship with your Financial Advisor and shaped by an understanding of your needs 
and aspirations. 
Known as the Client Relationship Agreement, this document outlines the terms and 
conditions of your relationship with us. By maintaining your Accounts at UBS, you agree to 
these terms and conditions and the other agreements and disclosures we refer to here. If 
signatures are required, please return the signed signature page in the enclosed envelope. 
To confirm that our records are complete, we will send you a record of the information you 
give us after you open a new Account. Please review the Client Information and Account 
Information pages of the Completing Your Account Opening Process package and notify 
us promptly if there are any updates or corrections. 
Please note: this Client Relationship Agreement applies to all of your accounts at UBS, 
including any Accounts you may already have with us and Accounts you may open in the 
future. You will not receive another copy of the Client Relationship Agreement or the 
Agreements and Disclosures unless there are updates and amendments, or if we require 
your signature on this Agreement when you open Accounts in another capacity. Some of 
the information in this document and the other agreements and disclosures we send you 
may not apply to you now. Please retain these documents for future reference because 
they contain important information if you decide to add services or open new Accounts. 
The terms and conditions in this Client Relationship Agreement apply to all Accounts you 
open with UBS Financial Services Inc. or UBS Financial Services Incorporated of Puerto Rico 
or any other introducing broker-dealer that has a clearing agreement with UBS Financial 
Services Inc. In addition, we will send you other agreements and disclosures for the UBS 
accounts and services you choose when you open your account, as well as features you 
may add in the future. We refer to all these documents, including any amendments, as the

Individual Retirement Accounts 
The Agreements and Disclosures booklet contains the UBS IRA Custodial Agreements and 
the IRA Disclosure Statements that apply to any Traditional, Roth, SEP or SIMPLE Individual 
Retirement Accounts (IRAs) you open with us now or in the future. If we make changes to 
the UBS IRA Custodial Agreement and the IRA Disclosure Statement we will send you 
updated documents, and you agree to be subject to those updated terms and conditions. 
According to the UBS IRA Custodial Agreements, UBS Financial Services Inc. is named as 
the custodian of your IRA when we accept the Account. At your death, the beneficiary or 
beneficiaries whose name(s) are shown on the Account Information pages of the 
Completing Your New Account Process package will become entitled to your IRA. 
Beneficiaries must be named in writing. Your written designation may apply to future 
accounts, and in that case, we will confirm your designation in the Completing Your 
Account Opening Process package. If you do not designate beneficiaries, or your 
beneficiary designation does not effectively dispose of the assets, your beneficiary with 
respect to the IRA or any part of the IRA not effectively disposed of, will be your surviving 
spouse, or your estate if you do not have a surviving spouse. You may be charged a 
Custodial Account fee in connection with this IRA. 
If this IRA account is funded via transfer from a non-UBS account, you represent that all 
transfers to this account originate from a same name inherited IRA of the same type 
indicated on this IRA Account Application (e.g., Traditional IRA, Roth IRA) and/or a direct 
rollover from a qualified plan which named you as beneficiary. 
Accounts with Cash Management Features 
The Agreements and Disclosures booklet contains the terms and conditions that apply to 
the cash management features you may select. All requests to enroll in cash management 
features are subject to approval. We consider your continued use of your Account as your 
acceptance of the applicable terms and conditions. 
There are important differences in the cash management features and other services that 
are available to U.S. residents through UBS accounts and those that are available to clients 
who reside outside the U.S. For example, we have different sweep programs for uninvested 
cash and different Card programs for these accounts. This agreement and the Agreements 
and Disclosures booklet describe which programs apply to which types of accounts. 
Verbal Authorization to Upgrade or Add Cash Management Features to an Account 
For any account you have with us now or may open in the future, we may accept verbal 
requests to upgrade or add cash management features to your Account. Generally, we 
permit any authorized person to provide verbal instructions to upgrade or add services to 
your Account unless you instruct us otherwise. In some circumstances, we may ask you or 
another person who is named on the account to sign additional documents or provide 
additional information for those additional features. We will provide you updated terms 
and conditions for the services you request if we have not already sent them to you or 
another owner of the Account. We consider your use of the Account as your acceptance of 
the applicable terms and conditions. 
Our Sweep Options and Your Sweep Election 
As a service to you, we offer options for the automatic investment or deposit of available 
cash balances ("sweep") in your Accounts. Current Sweep Options include the UBS Bank 
Sweep Programs and the Sweep Funds. The available Sweep Options and their features, 
and the eligibility of an Account for a specific Sweep Option varies by the type of Account 
you open, the services you select, the type of entity you are and your country of residence. 
We may change or discontinue our sweep service at any time, including adding or 
discontinuing specific Sweep Options. We may establish criteria for Sweep Options offered 
to different clients, including, but not limited to, establishing minimum asset requirements 
for clients to qualify for specific Sweep Options. 
You authorize and direct us to deposit or invest your available cash balances on each 
business day in your Sweep Option and to withdraw your funds from, or liquidate your

IRA Plan prototype document from 
your UBS Financial Advisor.

shares in your Sweep Option, as described in this section and in the General Terms and 
Conditions in the Agreements and Disclosures booklet, and any amendments. 
Please refer to the UBS Bank Sweep Programs Disclosure Statement for a description of the 
eligibility requirements for the UBS Bank Sweep Programs. If your Account is not eligible 
for the UBS Bank Sweep Programs, you may select an available Sweep Fund as the Sweep 
Option for your Account. 
For Accounts eligible for one of the UBS Bank Sweep Programs, unless you are eligible for 
and select an available tax-advantaged Sweep Fund, your Sweep Option will be one of the 
UBS Bank Sweep Programs. 
In general, most clients with a Resource Management Account® (RMA®), Individual 
Retirement Account (IRA), Basic Investment Account, Business Services Account® (BSA®), 
Coverdell Education Savings Account and certain Investment Advisory Accounts will be 
eligible for one of the UBS Bank Sweep Programs. Eligibility is based primarily upon the 
type of client. Most non-business clients and employee benefit plans qualified under 
Section 401(a) or Section 403(bX7) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or 
under any other employee retirement or welfare plan subject to the Employee Retirement 
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA) (Plans) are eligible for the Deposit 
Program. In cases where a participant in a Plan has established a Securities Account for 
purposes of participation in the Plan (each a Plan Participant), the Plan Participant will be 
eligible for the Deposit Program. Most business clients are eligible for the Business 
Program. 
The UBS Bank Sweep Programs 
Through each of the UBS Bank Sweep Programs, available cash balances in each eligible 
Account are automatically deposited into deposit accounts at Bank USA up to the Bank 
USA Sweep Cap. Available cash balances in excess of the Bank USA Sweep Cap will be 
automatically swept without limit to your Secondary Sweep Option. 
Unless you select an available Sweep Fund, the Secondary Sweep Option for eligible 
Accounts other than Investment Advisory Accounts is deposit accounts at AG Stamford 
Branch. Investment Advisory Accounts will not sweep to the AG Stamford Branch; instead 
the Secondary Sweep Option for Investment Advisory Accounts will be an available Sweep 
Fund. 
Funds in deposit accounts at AG Stamford Branch are not eligible for FDIC 
Insurance or protection by SIPC. Sweep Funds are not FDIC-insured, not guaranteed by 
a bank, are sold by prospectus only and may lose value. 
Deposits held at Bank USA through the Business Program are subject to monthly 
withdrawal limits, as described in the UBS Bank Sweep Programs Disclosure Statement. If 
your withdrawals in a month reach the limit, all funds on deposit through the Business 
Program will be withdrawn from Bank USA and transferred into your Secondary Sweep 
Option and available cash balances will sweep to your Secondary Sweep Option for the 
remainder of the month. These funds, up to the Bank USA Sweep Cap, will be transferred 
back to Bank USA on the first business day of the following month. 
FDIC Insurance Coverage and Limitations: If you have more than one Account that 
sweeps to Bank USA, the amount deposited at Bank USA may exceed the amount covered 
by FDIC insurance (currently $250,000 per insurable capacity). You are responsible for 
monitoring the total amount of deposits that you have with Bank USA to 
determine the extent of FDIC deposit insurance coverage available to you. Please 
refer to the UBS Bank Sweep Programs Disclosure Statement for more detailed information 
regarding the UBS Bank Sweep Programs and FDIC insurance. 
Alternatives to the UBS Bank Sweep Programs 
With the exception of tax-advantaged Accounts and Basic Investment Accounts, if you are 
eligible to participate in one of the UBS Bank Sweep Programs, but do not wish to have 
your available cash balances deposited with Bank USA, you may elect at any time to have

UBS Select Tax-Free Capital Fund (subject to minimum asset requirements) 
State-specific municipal funds are intended for residents of those states only. The Puerto 
Rico Short Term Investment Fund, Inc. is offered exclusively to Puerto Rico residents as 
defined in the fund's prospectus. The Puerto Rico Short Term Investment Fund is not a 
money market fund registered under the U.S. Investment Company Ad of 1940, does not 
comply with rules applicable to U.S. registered funds, presents a higher degree of risk than 
those funds, and is for Puerto Rico residents holding accounts with UBS Financial Services 
Incorporated of Puerto Rico only. The Puerto Rico Short Term Investment Fund and the 
Sweep Funds are sold by prospectus only, and are not FDIC-insured, not guaranteed by 
a bank, and may lose value. 
If your Account is tax-advantaged, or is a Basic Investment Account, whether 
tax-advantaged or not, you are not eligible to select a tax-advantaged Sweep Fund as a 
Sweep Option. Tax-advantaged Accounts include, but are not limited to, Accounts of 
Plans, Plan Participants and IRAs. If your tax-advantaged Account or Basic Investment 
Account is not an Investment Advisory Account, and you choose not to participate in a 
Bank Sweep Program, available cash balances will remain in your Account and will not 
earn interest. If your tax-advantaged Account or Basic Investment Account is an 
Investment Advisory Account, available cash balances must be swept through a Bank 
Sweep Program. 
Changing Your Sweep Option 
You may change your sweep election to an available alternative Sweep Option at any time. 
By instructing us to change your sweep election, you are authorizing and directing us to 
redeem your Sweep Fund shares, or withdraw funds from one of the UBS Bank Sweep 
Programs, and transfer the funds to your new Sweep Option. You may change your sweep 
election by contacting your Financial Advisor. 
For additional information regarding program availability and Account eligibility, please 
refer to the UBS Bank Sweep Programs Disclosure Statement and the UBS International 
Deposit Account Sweep Program Disclosure in the Agreements and Disclosures booklet, 
and to the prospectuses for the Sweep Funds and the Puerto Rico Short Term Investment 
Fund. 
Institutional Sweep Funds and Automatic Exchanges 
We may offer Institutional Sweep Funds as Sweep Options or Secondary Sweep Options 
for clients (except for Plans and IRAs in investment advisory programs) who meet certain 
minimum asset thresholds. Current eligibility criteria may be obtained from your Financial 
Advisor. UBS may change the eligibility criteria at any time in its discretion without notice 
to you. Institutional Sweep Funds will generally offer a higher yield than other Sweep 
Funds, though there is no guarantee that the yield will be, or will remain, higher. 
Clients other than Plans and Plan Participants 
Your eligibility for the Institutional Sweep Funds will be determined at the end of each 
month, based on the value of your Marketing Relationship assets as determined in the sole 
discretion of UBS. If the value of your Marketing Relationship assets reaches the minimum 
asset threshold at any time other than the end of the month, you will not be eligible for an 
Institutional Sweep Fund. 
Plans and Plan Participants 
A Plan's eligibility for the Institutional Sweep Funds will be determined at the end of each 
month, based on the value of the Plan's QP Relationship assets, as determined in the sole 
'Secondary Sweep Option' refers to 
deposit accounts at AG Stamford 
Branch or one of the available Sweep 
Funds. 
"Investment Advisory Account' refers 
to an Account enrolled in any of the

discretion of UBS. A Plan Participant's eligibility for the Institutional Sweep Funds will be 
determined at the end of each month, based on the greater of the value of the Plan's QP 
Relationship assets and the Plan Participant's Marketing Relationship assets, both as 
determined in the sole discretion of UBS. If the value of a Plan's QP Relationship assets or 
a Plan Participant's Marketing Relationship assets reaches the minimum asset threshold at 
any time other than the end of the month, the Plan or Plan Participant will not be eligible 
for an Institutional Sweep Fund. 
If you are eligible for an Institutional Sweep Fund as either your Sweep Fund or your 
Secondary Sweep Option for one of the Bank Sweep Programs, we will liquidate your 
shares in your current Sweep Fund or your Secondary Sweep Option, as applicable, and 
purchase shares in the Institutional Sweep Fund with the same investment objectives 
without direction from you. Thereafter, your Sweep Fund or Secondary Sweep Option, as 
applicable, will be the Institutional Sweep Fund. Once an Account's Sweep Option or 
Secondary Sweep Option, as applicable, is an Institutional Sweep Fund and a first purchase 
has been made into the Fund, that Institutional Sweep Fund will remain the Account's 
Sweep Option or Secondary Sweep Option even if the Account's Marketing Relationship 
assets cease to meet the minimum asset thresholds for that Institutional Sweep Fund. QP 
Relationship assets as a means to determine eligibility will not be available until on or 
about Dec 2, 2013. 
Check Writing 
Many UBS accounts incorporate a check writing feature. If you choose this feature for your 
account, you authorize us and our Check Provider to honor checks that bear your 
signature(s) and unsigned drafts that are presented on the basis of separate written 
authorization from you to the payee. These checks may be used only in conjunction with 
your accounts and only up to the account's 'Withdrawal Limit' as defined in the General 
Terms and Conditions in the Agreements and Disclosures booklet. We will deduct funds 
from your Accounts and reimburse the Check Provider in federal funds when checks or 
drafts are presented to the Check Provider. We may delay or deny payment if there are 
insufficient available assets in your Account to cover payment on the day you write the 
check or authorize the draft through the day on which we deduct funds from your 
accounts to pay the check or draft. 
Bill Payment and Electronic Funds Transfer Services 
Many UBS accounts incorporate the Bill Payment and Electronic Funds Transfer services. If 
you enroll in these services, you authorize UBS and its processing bank to effect the types 
of transactions described in the Bill Payment and Electronic Funds Transfer Service 
Agreement. This service agreement also applies to other electronic transfers to or from 
your Accounts, including transfers made with UBS CashConnect feature and certain 
payments made through the Automated Clearing House ("ACH") system, even if you do 
not enroll in this service. 
"Check Provider' is the provider and 
processor we have appointed to 
handle payment of your checks and 
drafts. We reserve the right to 
change check providers from time to 
time. 
The Bill Payment and Electronic Funds 
Transfer Service Agreement is located 
in the Agreements and Disclosures 
booklet. 
Bill payments are only available to 
payees located in the U.S. 
Transfers through the ACH system 
are only available to and from 
accounts at financial institutions and 
banks within the U.S.

AG at the Cayman Islands Branch where funds are invested into short-term deposits. If 
you are eligible and choose to participate in the IDA sweep program, free cash balances in 
your Accounts are automatically deposited into a demand deposit account at the New York 
Branch of UBS AG, from which funds are then swept and re-deposited each business day 
into an overnight deposit account at the Cayman Islands branch of UBS AG. As your 
agent, UBS Financial Services Inc. will make the necessary withdrawals from the New York 
deposit account to satisfy debits or charges in your Account in accordance with the 
General Terms and Conditions. You may choose to withdraw from the IDA Program at any 
time, however, your free cash balances in your Account at UBS Financial Services Inc. will 
not earn interest or dividends. Funds on deposit in the accounts at the New York and the 
Cayman Islands branches of UBS AG are not eligible for federal deposit insurance from the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). 
A full description of the IDA Sweep Program is included in the Agreements and Disclosures 
Booklet. At times, we may update or modify the terms of the IDA Sweep Program and/or 
change the Sweep Options we make available. 
UBS Visa Debit Card® 
The International RMA includes the UBS Visa Debit Card (Card). If you are eligible for the 
Card under applicable law and UBS policies and you request this feature either verbally or 
in writing, you will be issued one or more Card(s) by the Card Issuer. UBS or the Card 
Issuer will complete any transactions you initiate using the Card(s). Your use of the Card 
constitutes your agreement to the terms and conditions in the UBS Visa Debit Card 
Cardholder Agreement that is included in the Agreements and Disclosures booklet. 
The Card Issuer will approve transactions up to your account's "Withdrawal Limit," as 
described in the Agreements and Disclosures booklet. You agree to maintain sufficient 
available assets in your account to make payment in full and understand that transactions 
may be denied if there are insufficient assets in your account to make full payment for any 
Card transactions as they are processed. 
As your Card cash withdrawals are processed, we will deduct funds from your Account to 
reimburse the Card Issuer. Once each calendar month, we will deduct from your Account 
the amount of purchases made with the Card that have been received by the Card Issuer 
but not yet deducted from your Account. The Card Issuer may suspend or cancel Cards if 
there are insufficient assets to cover transactions. 
The features and fees of your 
International Resource Management 
Account are more fully described in 
the Agreements and Disclosures 
booklet. 
'Card issuer' refers to UBS Bank 
USA, its successors or assigns, or 
the issuer of the UBS Card we 
appoint in our sole discretion. 
The UBS Credit Card and the UBS 
Rewards Program are not features 
of the International RMA.

Insurance Accounts 
As a service to clients, we also offer accounts to maintain or permit the purchase of 
insurance products and services. By signing the Signature Page for your non-brokerage 
insurance account, you accept the Client Relationship Agreement and the other documents 
referred to here, and as a result, you may be able to open brokerage accounts with us in 
the future without having to sign additional agreements. 
Joint Accounts 
For joint accounts, each person or entity named on the Account has full power and 
authority over the Account, and the account holders are jointly and severally liable for all 
obligations with respect to the Account. Please refer to the "Joint Accounts" section of the 
General Terms and Conditions for more information about the terms and conditions that 
apply to joint accounts. 
When we open additional joint accounts for the same account holders, we establish them 
with the same legal ownership as the most recently-opened joint account, unless we are 
instructed otherwise. If you request a different form of ownership, we will request your 
signature acknowledging that election. For example, if you open an account as joint 
tenants with rights of survivorship, your next account with the same parties will also be 
established as joint tenants with rights of survivorship, unless you tell us you want a 
different type of ownership for that account. 
Margin Agreement and Margin Requirements 
All Accounts that you open now or in the future will be established with margin, if eligible, 
unless you instruct us that you do not want margin privileges for specific Accounts. By 
signing the Signature Page for any Account except for an ERISA Plan or for an Estate, you 
agree that the Margin Agreement governs your use of margin in all of your current 
Accounts and any Accounts that you may open in the future. 
Therefore, if you do not establish margin privileges when you open an Account and later 
decide to use margin, you may be able to do so without signing additional forms. Likewise, 
if you cancel your margin privileges on an Account, your margin agreement with us will 
remain in effect and you may request to use margin again at any time. In either event, we 
will confirm your request. 
When you use your margin privileges, we hold your securities in your Account as collateral 
against the amounts you borrow, and your securities may be loaned to UBS or to others as 
described in the Margin Agreement. In addition, margin-eligible Accounts are subject to 
applicable statutes, rules, regulations, procedures or industry customs. We may deem it 
necessary or advisable to establish additional requirements for margin accounts. You agree 
to maintain sufficient assets to satisfy all applicable statutes, rules or regulations, or as we 
deem necessary or advisable. You also agree to maintain sufficient assets in your Account 
to satisfy any and all margin calls issued in connection with the Account. 
As long as your Account is a margin account, you authorize UBS in the usual course of 
business to lend, pledge as collateral, hypothecate, relend or repledge any Property we 
carry for you on margin, whether separately or together with Property of others, either to 
ourselves or to others. This authorization remains in effect until we receive payment for 
such Property. 
When you use your margin privileges, as permitted by law, we may use certain securities in 
your account for, among other things, settling short sales and lending securities for short 
sales. We may receive and retain compensation in connection with such transactions. If 
you are engaged in short selling a security, you may incur a charge due to certain 
borrowing costs for that particular security. 
Subject to applicable rules and regulations, we may amend , the requirements applicable to 
your margin account at any time in our sole discretion, including changing the level of 
credit available to you and applicable maintenance requirements without notice to you. A 
prior demand or call, or prior notice of the time and place of such sale or purchase shall 
not be considered a waiver of our right to sell or buy without demand or notice as 
described here. For additional terms, please refer to the section 'Liquidation of Collateral 
or Account" below. 
If you do not want to establish 
margin for your current accounts or 
any accounts you open in the future, 
please contact your Financial Advisor. 
Please note: UBS does not extend 
margin for the following accounts: 
Individual Retirement Accounts 
ERISA Plans 
Coverdell Education Savings 
Account 
403(b)(7) Accounts 
UGMA 
UTMA 
Estate 
529 Plan Accounts 
Hypothecation is the pledging of 
securities or other assets to secure a 
loan such as debit balance in a 
margin account. 
"Property" includes, but is not limited 
to, securities, securities entitlements, 
investment property and financial 
assets, including without limitation, 
money, stocks, options, bonds, 
notes, futures contracts, 
commodities, commercial paper, 
certificates of deposit and other 
obligations, contracts, all other 
property usually and customarily 
dealt in by brokerage firms and any

UBS Client Relationship Agreement 
We have the right to satisfy a margin call or to obtain full or partial payment of a margin 
loan at any time without a demand for margin or additional margin or other notice. To 
satisfy a margin call or to obtain full or partial payment of the margin loan, in addition to 
all rights provided by law, we have the right to: 
1. 
require additional collateral, 
2. 
sell any Property in any of your Accounts with us, whether carried individually or 
jointly with others, 
3. 
buy any Property which may be held short in your Account, 
4. 
cancel any open orders and close any or all outstanding contracts, or 
5. 
liquidate any of your Accounts with us. 
We may also exercise these rights if in our discretion we consider it necessary for your or 
our protection; if a bankruptcy petition, or petition for the appointment of a receiver, is 
filed by or against you; if an attachment is levied against any Account; or in the event of 
your death or dissolution. 
You understand that there are substantial risks involved in trading securities on 
margin, using leverage as a liquidity source or as part of your investment strategy, 
or otherwise pledging your securities in order to obtain credit. Please review the 
Loan Disclosure Statement included in the Agreements and Disclosures booklet 
carefully for a detailed discussion of these risks. 
Security interest 
As security for the payment of all liabilities or indebtedness presently outstanding or to be 
incurred under this or any other agreement between you and any UBS Entity, including but 
not limited to any loans or promissory notes, you hereby grant to each UBS Entity a security 
interest in and lien on any and all Property held or carried by any UBS Entity for you or on 
your behalf in or credited to any UBS Account(s) (other than qualified plan or IRA accounts 
or other accounts where doing so would be a prohibited transaction or violation of 
applicable law or regulation) and in any other Account with any UBS Entity in which you 
may have any legal, equitable or other interest. 
All such Property will be subject to such security interest as collateral for the discharge of 
your obligations to any UBS Entity, wherever or however arising and without regard to 
whether or not we made loans with respect to that Property. In enforcing our security 
interest, we have the discretion to determine the amount, order and manner in which the 
Property will be sold and have all the rights and remedies available to a secured party 
under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) in addition to all other rights provided in this 
Agreement or by law. 
You will not cause or allow any of the Property held in any of your UBS Accounts, whether 
owned now or acquired later, to be or become subject to any liens, security interests, 
mortgages or encumbrances of any nature other than our security interest, without our 
prior written consent. Each UBS Entity shall act as agent for and on behalf of each UBS 
Entity for purposes of perfecting, maintaining and enforcing the security interests granted 
hereunder or by operation of law. Each UBS Entity acting in the capacity of a deposit bank, 
securities intermediary or commodities intermediary, agrees to follow the instructions and 
entitlement orders of each other UBS Entity with respect to the Property as a secured party 
without further consent by you. You hereby authorize and direct each UBS Entity to follow 
the instructions and entitlement orders of each other UBS Entity.

Liquidation of Collateral or Account 
We may satisfy any and all amounts you owe us in connection with any of your Accounts 
or agreements with us, or any other agreement between you and any UBS Entity, including 
but not limited to any loans or promissory notes, from Property we hold or carry in any of 
your Accounts with us (other than qualified plan or IRA accounts or other accounts where 
doing so would be a prohibited transaction or violation of applicable law or regulation). 
Additionally, we may sell any or all Property held in any of your Accounts with us and 
cancel any open orders for the purchase or sale of any Property without notice in the event 
of your death or dissolution, or whenever in our discretion it is necessary for our 
protection. In these instances, we may also borrow or buy-in all Property held in any of 
your Accounts required to make delivery against any sale initiated for you. These sales or 
purchases may be public or private and may be made without advertising or notice to you 
and in the manner we determine in our sole discretion. You waive diligence, presentment, 
protest, demand for payment and notice of nonpayment and further waive all other 
notices and formalities to which you may be entitled under applicable law or otherwise, to 
the extent the waiver of such notices and other formalities is permissible under applicable 
law. Your waiver will not be invalidated by any demands, calls, tenders or notices that we 
may make. At any sale, we may purchase the Property or any portion thereof free of any 
right of redemption and you will remain liable for any deficiency in any of your Accounts, 
plus any accrued interest on the deficiency at our then customary rate, if applicable, or at 
the maximum rate allowable by law. We will not be liable to you in any way for any loses 
or adverse tax consequences resulting from a liquidation of your Property. 
USA Patriot Act 
To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, 
Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify and record information and 
documentation identifying each account holder. Therefore, when you open an Account, 
we ask for your name, address, date of birth and other identifying information about you. 
We may ask to see your driver's license or other identifying documents. We may also 
screen your name against various databases to verify your identity. If we are unable to 
verify your identity, we may take any of the actions described under "Termination of your 
Account" in the General Terms and Conditions in the Agreements and Disclosures booklet. 
Credit Report 
When you open an account with us, we may obtain your credit report or other credit 
references and verify or update the credit information you may have given to us previously. 
We may make verbal and written inquiries concerning your credit history. Likewise, we 
may request your credit report or other credit information and provide it to our Card 
Issuers and Check Provider or to our affiliates, as necessary or advisable to service and 
maintain your Accounts. We also use this information to offer you additional products that 
may be of interest to you.

Your Privacy 
At UBS, we are committed to safeguarding your personal information. Please refer to the 
UBS Client Privacy Notice in the Agreements and Disclosures booklet, which describes the 
personal information we collect about you and how we handle and protect it. 
Disclosure of Beneficial Ownership 
The issuers of securities held in your Accounts may request your name, address and 
security position so that they may contact you directly for proxy voting and other 
shareholder communications. You may instruct us not to supply this information, in which 
case, you will receive information regarding those securities from UBS instead of the 
issuers. Your current instructions are reflected on the Account Information pages of the 
Completing Your Account Opening Process package. If you would like to change your 
instructions, please call your Financial Advisor. 
As described in the section "Foreign Securities" in the General Terms and Conditions, we 
may share information about the beneficial ownership of foreign securities in your 
Accounts with the issuers of those securities, foreign government authorities of their 
agent, to obtain reduced tax withholding rates, to comply with local law or to respond to 
other lawful requests. 
Householding of Statements and Other Communications 
As a convenience to you, we may consolidate periodic communications for certain 
accounts with the same address. This practice, called "householding," applies to account 
statements, trade confirmations, personal and financial information required to be sent by 
regulation, preliminary and final prospectuses and Summary of Accounts statements, 
which provide consolidated information for all of the accounts in your household. 
Households are determined as follows: 
Accounts that share the same name, address and Social Security or Tax ID 
Number are automatically placed in the same household. 
ao 
Accounts that share only the same address will be placed in the same household 
only with the express consent of all the Account holders. 
We mail househeld communications in a single envelope (if you receive paper delivery) or, 
if you receive electronic delivery, we make them available through UBS Online Services or 
other electronic delivery method. Any member of your household who is enrolled in UBS 
Online Services can have access to view all Accounts in the household. 
The composition of a household will change as clients move away from the household 
mailing address, and the addressee for househeld mailings may also change over time. 
Where owners of joint accounts live at different addresses, househeld mailings will be sent 
to at least one account owner's address and may be included with mailings for other 
accounts at that address under the conditions described above. 
Periodically we are required by industry regulators to send records of certain 
personal and financial information to our clients. Because we deliver these records 
with your account statements, other members of your household may have access to these 
records unless you instruct us to send them to you separately. 
If you do not want your statements and other periodic communications from us to be 
bundled by household, please contact your Financial Advisor and ask to receive individual 
mailings in separate envelopes or delivered separately via electronic means. 
E-mail Communications 
We discourage clients from transmitting personal or confidential information through 
e-mail. If you choose to send personal and confidential information to us via e-mail, we 
cannot be responsible for any loss or damages that occur as a result, such as losses or 
damages arising from mistaken identity or unauthorized access and the use of the 
information (for any purpose) by others who may intercept or otherwise access the 
communications during and after transmission. 
Please see the UBS Client Privacy 
Notice in the Agreements and 
Disclosures booklet for further 
information, including how to 
opt-out of certain information 
sharing. 
Please refer to the Client Privacy 
Notice for more information about 
Statement Householding. 
If you do not want your statements 
to be bundled by household, please 
contact your financial Advisor and 
ask to receive individual account 
statements mailed in separate 
envelopes or delivered separately via 
electronic means.

Arbitration 
This Agreement contains a predispute arbitration clause. By signing an arbitration 
agreement the parties agree as follows: 
co 
All parties to this Agreement are giving up the right to sue each other in court, 
including the right to a trial by jury, except as provided by the rules of the arbitration 
forum in which a claim is filed. 
Arbitration awards are generally final and binding; a party's ability to have a court 
reverse or modify an arbitration award is very limited. 
The ability of the parties to obtain documents, witness statements and other 
discovery is generally more limited in arbitration than in court proceedings. 
The arbitrators do not have to explain the reason(s) for their award, unless, in an 
eligible case, a joint request for an explained decision has been submitted by all 
parties to the panel at least 20 days prior to the first scheduled hearing date. 
co 
The panel of arbitrators will typically include a minority of arbitrators who were or are 
affiliated with the securities industry. 
CO 
The rules of some arbitration forums may impose time limits for bringing a claim in 
arbitration. In some cases, a claim that is ineligible for arbitration may be brought in 
court. 
co 
The rules of the arbitration forum in which the claim is filed, and any amendments to 
them, shall be incorporated into this Agreement. 
By opening an account at UBS, and by UBS Financial Services Inc. or UBS Financial Services 
Incorporated of Puerto Rico by accepting your application and carrying your account, you, 
UBS Financial Services Inc. and UBS Financial Service Incorporated of Puerto Rico agree as 
follows: 
We agree to resolve any controversy, claim or issue in any controversy that may arise 
by arbitration, whether it happen before or after, or at the time this Agreement was 
executed, including but not limited to controversies, claims or issues in any 
controversy concerning any account, transaction, dispute or the construction, 
performance or breach of this Agreement or any other agreement 
co 
Any arbitration under this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act 
and shall be conducted before an arbitration panel convened by the Financial Industry 
Regulatory Authority (FINRA) or any other national securities exchange's arbitration 
forum, upon which UBS Financial Services Inc. is legally required to arbitrate the 
controversy with you, including, where applicable, the Municipal Securities 
Rulemaking Board. 
Such arbitration shall be governed by the rules of the organization convening the 
panel. 
All parties to this Agreement agree that the arbitrators shall resolve any controversy in 
accordance with applicable law. 
The arbitrators will apply state and federal statutes of limitation the same as if the 
claim were brought as a civil action in court. 
The award of the arbitration panel is not subject to appeal and judgment upon the 
award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. 
No person shall bring a putative or certified class action to arbitration nor seek to 
enforce any pre-dispute arbitration Agreement against any person who has initiated 
in court a putative class action; or who is a member of a putative class who has not 
opted out of the class with respect to any claims encompassed by the putative class 
action until: 
— 
the class certification is denied; or 
— 
the class is decertified; or 
— 
the customer is excluded from the class by the court. Such forbearance to 
enforce an agreement to arbitrate shall not constitute a waiver of any rights 
under this agreement except to the extent stated herein. 
ao 
You expressly agree that service of process in any action shall be sufficient if served 
by certified mail, return receipt requested, at your last address known to UBS. 
ao 
You expressly waive any defense to service of process as set forth above. 
This Arbitration Agreement 
represents standard industry practice 
and binds you and us to arbitrate any 
disagreements that may arise 
between us.

want it to get lost given the discovery motion schedule. The attached is based on our conversations with M, including 
his email with suggested language for the prefatory language, and responds to the two attached defense letters. Happy to 
discuss anytime and to incorporate comments and suggestions.

Re: 
United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 (RMB) 
Dear Mr. Weinberg: 
The Government writes in response to your letters dated July 26, 2019, requesting 
preservation and production of seven general categories of documents (the "July Letter"), and 
August 1, 2019, requesting preservation and production in connection with a particular individual 
(the "August Letter") (collectively, the "Letters"). Without conceding any obligation to preserve 
any of the categories of documents, or, further, any obligation to produce responsive such 
documents to the extent any exist, we will take reasonable steps to ensure the preservation of 
documents we believe may be covered by the Letters' identified categories to the extent such 
documents are already within the possession, custody, or control of the U.S. Attorney's Office for 
the Southern District of New York (the "Office"). Other than documents already within the 
possession, custody, or control of the Office, we will not be directing any other office or agency, 
local, state, federal, or foreign, including any other office or component of the U.S. Department of 
Justice, or any other nonparty to this case, including but not limited to victims or their counsel 
(collectively, and without limitation, the "Non-Party Entities and Individuals"), to institute such 
preservation.' 
Such agencies, departments, entities, and individuals are not parties to this 
litigation, they are not a part of the prosecution team as that term has been defined under well-
The departments, agencies, entities, and individuals for which you assert this Office has "the 
legal right or practical ability obtain" includes, without limitation, all 93 U.S. Attorney's Offices 
across the nation, the Department of Justice Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section, the 
Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Homeland Security, the New York [City] 
Police Department, the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, the State Attorney's Office for the 
15th Judicial District in and for Palm Beach County, the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office, the 
New Mexico Attorney General's Office, and any other "local, state, or foreign law enforcement 
entities involved in any way in regulating or investigating the activities alleged in the Indictment 
or related transactions." July Letter at 2-3. The scope of these requests is outlandishly overbroad. 
EFTA00016596
--- PAGE 2 ---
established Second Circuit law, and they are beyond the scope of this Office's disclosure 
obligations in this case. 
We expect to take all necessary steps to comply with our obligations under or pursuant to 
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 16 and 26.2, Brady v. Maryland, and 18 U.S.C. § 3500 
(collectively, this Office's "Obligations"). If you have a specific request to make to us under Rules 
or 26.2, Brady, or § 3500, we will address it appropriately. 
With respect to the specific requests in the Letters, we note at the outset that a number of 
those categories call for material that falls well beyond the scope of Rule 16 or any recognized 
obligation under Brady and its progeny. In particular, we note that for purposes of discovery 
demands, "a 'defendant must make a prima facie showing of materiality, and must offer more than 
the conclusory allegation that the requested evidence is material.' United States v. Abdalla, 317 
F.Supp.3d 786, 790 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (quoting United States v. Urena, 989 F.Supp.2d 253, 261 
(S.D.N.Y. 2013)). Notably, "if the purported defense for which a defendant seeks to compel the 
production of certain documents is meritless as a matter of law, then the requested documents are 
not `material' for purposes of Rule 16." Id. at 791. 
Additionally, with respect to your assertion that the requested materials generally are 
necessary due to an intended motion to dismiss based on a prior non-prosecution agreement 
entered into by a U.S. Attorney's Office in a separate District, see July Letter at 3, we note that the 
defendant has failed to make any showing, much less a threshold credible showing, of the kind of 
due process violation that would make appropriate any discovery on an issue that is not a defense 
on the merits of the charges themselves, but rather an independent assertion that charges were 
brought for reasons that were improper or constitutionally invalid. See United States v. Armstrong, 
517 U.S. 456, 463 (1996). Indeed, the defendant will be unable to make any kind of showing of 
the conspiracy theory that there was activity inconsistent with any duty not to circumvent or 
transfer a case from an immunizing district to another district, because-as we have proffered to 
you and to the Court previously-this Office initiated its investigation without any transfer, 
circumvention, or other influence from any other District. 
Regarding the specific requests the July Letter does contain, we respond as follows: 
First Request: 
Any investigatory files provided to the United States Attorney's Office for the 
Southern District of New York (or FBI agents working therewith) by the United 
States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida, the Middle District 
of Florida, and/or the Northern District of Georgia (or FBI agents working 
therewith). 
We will produce materials consistent with our Obligations that are in the care, custody, or 
control of this Office, irrespective of the source from which those files were obtained. 
Second Request: Any investigatory files that were received or accessed by the United States 
Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York (or FBI agents working 
therewith) that were sent or disclosed by or originated with the United States 
Attorney's Offices of the Southern District of Florida, the Middle District of 
Florida, and/or the Northern District of Georgia (or FBI agents working 
therewith). 
EFTA00016597
--- PAGE 3 ---
Consistent with our response to the First Request, we will produce materials consistent 
with our Obligations that are in the care, custody, or control of this Office, irrespective of the 
source from which those files were obtained. 
Third Request: 
Communications regarding Mr. Epstein between and among "Main Justice" 
(including the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section) and the United States 
Attorney's Offices for the Southern District of Florida, Middle District of 
Florida, Northern District of Georgia, and the Southern District of New York. 
To the extent any such communications constitute materials pursuant to our Obligations 
and are in the care, custody, or control of this Office, we will produce such materials. However, 
we are not currently aware that any such communications within this Office's care, custody, or 
control do fall within our Obligations. To the extent this request seeks materials not subject to our 
Obligations, they are vastly overbroad and fall well outside the scope of Rule 16 discovery or any 
other of our Obligations. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(2) (noting that Rule 16 does not authorize the 
discovery or inspection of internal government documents made by an attorney for the government 
or other government agent in connection with investigating or prosecuting the case); see also 
Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 463 ("[U]nder Rule 16(a)(2), [a defendant] may not examine Government 
work product in connection with his case."). Accordingly, we will not produce any such 
communications in the care, custody, or control of this Office that are not subject to our 
Obligations. 
As noted above, we also will not direct Non-Party Entities and Individuals to preserve or 
produce materials that are not within the care, custody, or control of this Office. 
Fourth Request•. 
Any decision to initiate (or not initiate) criminal proceedings against Mr. 
Epstein. 
To the extent any such communications constitute materials pursuant to our Obligations 
and are in the care, custody, or control of this Office, we will produce such materials. However, 
we are not currently aware that any such communications within this Office's care, custody, or 
control do fall within our Obligations. To the extent this request seeks materials not subject to our 
Obligations, they are vastly overbroad and fall well outside the scope of Rule 16 discovery or any 
other of our Obligations. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(2) (noting that Rule 16 does not authorize the 
discovery or inspection of internal government documents made by an attorney for the government 
or other government agent in connection with investigating or prosecuting the case); see also 
Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 463 ("[U]nder Rule 16(a)(2), [a defendant] may not examine Government 
work product in connection with his case."). Accordingly, we will not produce any such 
communications in the care, custody, or control of this Office that are not subject to our 
Obligations. 
To the extent this request seeks materials not within the care, custody, or control of this 
Officer, as noted above, we also will not direct Non-Party Entities and Individuals to preserve or 
produce materials that are not within the care, custody, or control of this Office. 
Finally, as described above and as previously represented to the Court and to defense 
counsel, this Office initiated its investigation into the defendant independent of influence by any 
other U.S. Attorney's Office. 
EFTA00016598
--- PAGE 4 ---
Fifth Request: 
The NPA, including but limited to communications within the Department of 
Justice, with counsel for Mr. Epstein, with representatives of the United States 
Attorney's offices for the Southern and Middle District of Florida or the 
Northern District of Georgia and/or counsel for the alleged victims. 
To the extent any such communications constitute materials pursuant to our Obligations 
and are in the care, custody, or control of this Office, we will produce such materials. However, 
we are not currently aware that any such communications within this Office's care, custody, or 
control do fall within our Obligations, with the possible exception of any communications with 
counsel that include or constitute victim statements conveyed to this Office through victims' 
counsel that are within the definitions of materials subject to Brady or § 3500 obligations, any of 
which will be disclosed promptly and based on the Court's schedule, respectively. To the extent 
this request seeks materials not subject to our Obligations, they are vastly overbroad and fall well 
outside the scope of Rule 16 discovery or any other of our Obligations. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 
16(a)(2) (noting that Rule 16 does not authorize the discovery or inspection of internal government 
documents made by an attorney for the government or other government agent in connection with 
investigating or prosecuting the case); see also Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 463 ("[U]nder Rule 
16(a)(2), [a defendant] may not examine Government work product in connection with his case."). 
Accordingly, we will not produce any such communications in the care, custody, or control of this 
Office that are not subject to our Obligations. 
To the extent this request seeks materials not within the care, custody, or control of this 
Officer, as noted above, we also will not direct Non-Party Entities and Individuals to preserve or 
produce materials that are not within the care, custody, or control of this Office. 
In particular, as described above, to the extent any communications between this Office 
and victims or their counsel are subject to our Obligations, we will disclose them as appropriate; 
however, we strongly oppose any effort to obtain the identity of victims at this stage through 
meritless and unsupported suggestions of impropriety. 
Sixth Request: 
Communications with alleged victims (or their counsel), including but not 
limited to consultations conducted in relation to the government's response to 
the court's summary judgment order and proposed remedies in Jane Doe v. 
United States, No. 08-cv-80736 (S.D.FI.). 
This request for any and all communications with victims and their counsel, and apparently 
intended to apply to this Office as well as all Non-Party Entities and Individuals, is grossly 
overbroad and vastly beyond the scope of our Obligations. As described above, to the extent this 
Office has within its care, custody, or control statements made by victims or their counsel that are 
within the definitions of materials subject to Brady or § 3500 obligations, any such statements or 
materials will be disclosed promptly and based on the Court's schedule, respectively. Indeed, we 
note that this Office has already made disclosures of certain victim and/or witness statements in 
an abundance of caution. 
As to the request for any and all communications with victims and their counsel beyond 
those subject to our Obligations-a fishing expedition clearly intended to result in the disclosure 
of the identities of the victims in this case—we will not produce such material. 
EFTA00016599
--- PAGE 5 ---
Seventh Request: Information provided by alleged victims (or their counsel) related to Mr. 
Epstein prior to the return of the above-captioned Indictment. 
This request for any and all information provided by victims and their counsel, and 
apparently intended to apply to this Office as well as all Non-Party Entities and Individuals, is 
grossly overbroad and vastly beyond the scope of our Obligations. As described above, to the 
extent this Office has within its care, custody, or control information provided by victims or their 
counsel that are within the definitions of materials subject to Brady or § 3500 obligations, any such 
statements or materials will be disclosed promptly and based on the Court's schedule, respectively. 
Indeed, we note that this Office has already made disclosures of certain victim and/or witness 
statements in an abundance of caution. 
Similar to the above, as to the request for any and all information provided by victims and 
their counsel beyond those subject to our Obligations, which is plainly intended to result in the 
disclosure of the identities of victims in this case, we certainly will not produce such material. 
Regarding the specific requests contained in the August Letter, all of which relate to a 
particular employee of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida, to the extent 
any such communications constitute materials pursuant to our Obligations and are in the care, 
custody, or control of this Office, we will produce such materials. However, we are not currently 
aware that any such communications within this Office's care, custody, or control do fall within 
our Obligations. To the extent these requests seek materials not subject to our Obligations, they 
are vastly overbroad and fall well outside the scope of Rule 16 discovery or any other of our 
Obligations, as described above. Accordingly, we will not produce any such communications in 
the care, custody, or control of this Office that are not subject to our Obligations. Additionally, to 
the extent the requests of the August Letter seek materials not within the care, custody, or control 
of this Officer, as noted above, we also will not direct Non-Party Entities and Individuals to 
preserve or produce materials that are not within the care, custody, or control of this Office. In 
connection with the August Letter, we further reiterate that the undersigned had no pit-indictment 
contact with any individuals employed at the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of 
Florida, and the investigation resulting in the charges in the above-captioned case was not initiated 
by the provision of any investigative materials from any other U.S. Attorney's Office or other 
Non-Party Entities or Individuals. 
Very truly yours, 
GEOFFREY S. BERMAN

Thank you for the call and the update on the Epstein investigation with regard to charging Ghislaine Maxwell. 
As I mentioned, 
(copied) has been chosen as the permanent ASAC for the NYO's Violent Crime/Gang Branch of 
the Criminal Division. 
will be coordinating with you, 
and the rest of the team as we move forward. 
To rehash some of the points regarding Maxwell to get 
up to speed with the latest: 
SDNY is close to a final decision on charging Maxwell regarding her complicity in Epstein's sex trafficking 
FBI believes (as of January) that Maxwell is still living with a friend in the Boston suburb of Manchester by the Sea 
Confirmed by historical pen register with cell site location and subpoenas to Amazon for delivery location 
Since traditional surveillance, including a pole camera, are not suitable due to the secluded location, and in order to get 
more recent information, you propose getting a renewed pen register and Amazon subpoena. Additionally, you and the 
team may seek to get a mail cover. 
M
,
It was a pleasure working with you, 
and the team for the last several months. 
Good luck moving forward with the case. 
Best regards, 
Supervisory Special Agent 
FBI New York

Yes, I relayed our last conversations to the AUSAs after we spoke. Defense counsel continues to press (with us as well) for

we typically treat mail bound for in-custody defendants. Happy to discuss by phone.

Re: 
Deadline for Filing Motion under Federal Rule of Evidence 412, 
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) 
Dear Judge Nathan, 
I write to confirm that November 15, 2021 is the deadline for Ms. Maxwell to file a 
motion under Federal Rule of Evidence 412, which governs the admissibility of evidence of an 
alleged victim's sexual behavior. 
Under this Court's pretrial scheduling order, motions in limine are due on October 18. A 
motion in limine is a "pretrial request that certain inadmissible evidence not be referred to or 
offered at trial." Black's Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019). 
A motion under Rule 412 is not a motion in limine. Rather, it is a motion seeking 
permission to admit evidence the Rules of Evidence might otherwise exclude. It is a substantive 
motion under a specific rule of evidence with specific procedures for its filing, consideration, and 
determination. Fed. R. Evid. 412(c). And the Rule itself sets a deadline for filing a motion under 
its terms-14 days before trial. Fed. R. Evid. 412(c)(1)(B) (providing that a defendant must file 
her motion "at least 14 days before trial unless the court, for good cause, sets a different time"). 
EFTA00016720
--- PAGE 2 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 345 Filed 10/14/21 Page 2 of 3 
The Honorable Alison J. Nathan 
October 14, 2021 
Page 2 
Ms. Maxwell's counsel conferred with the government about the timing for filing a 
motion under Rule 412. The government seeks to have the motion briefed before jury selection 
begins. 
Implicit in the language of Rule 412(c)(1)(B) is authority for the Court to permit a 
defendant to file a motion closer to trial than 14 days, for good cause. But contrary to the 
government's suggestion, the Rule does not contemplate a deadline more than 14 days before 
trial.' 
In any event, Ms. Maxwell should not be required to file her Rule 412 motion any time 
before November 15, since it was just three days ago (October 11) that the government disclosed 
its 3500 material, including more than 8,000 pages of testifying witness disclosures. It will 
require significant time and resources to review and investigate this material and to identify any 
potentially admissible Rule 412 evidence. 
It was also just three days ago that the government alerted defense counsel to its 
anticipated Rule 404(b) witnesses. Rule 412's procedures apply not just to alleged victims named 
in the indictment but to any alleged victim in a case involving sexual misconduct, including 
alleged 404(b) victims. Fed. R. Evid. 412, Advisory Committee Notes, 1994 Amendments 
("Rule 412 extends to `pattern' witnesses in both criminal and civil cases about other instances 
of sexual misconduct by the person accused is otherwise admissible."). 
Finally, Ms. Maxwell (who is in custody) was only provided a copy of the government's 
disclosures earlier today in the late morning. Until Ms. Maxwell is able to review the material, 
See Fed. R. Evid. 412, Advisory Committee Notes, 1994 Amendments, Subdivision (c) 
("The requirement of a motion before trial is continued in the amended rule, as is the provision 
that a late motion may be permitted for good cause shown." (emphasis added)).

The Honorable Alison J. Nathan

Page 3 
her counsel cannot adequately consult with her about the defense. Allowing Ms. Maxwell to file 
her Rule 412 motion 14 days before trial, as the Rule itself provides, is essential for counsel to 
effectively consult with Ms. Maxwell, to investigate and research what evidence they will seek to 
admit under Rule 412, as well as to comply with the several procedural steps required by the 
Rule. 
Accordingly, unless this Court orders otherwise, Ms. Maxwell will file her Rule 412 
motion on or before November 15, 2021, as provided in Rule 412(c)(1)(B). 
Respectfully Submitted, 
Jeffrey S. Pagliuca

BARKET MSTEIN 
BARKET EPSTEIN KEARON ALDEA 6, LOTURCO,LLP 
January 13, 2020 
BY ECF 
The Honorable Kenneth K. Karas 
United States District Judge 
Southern District of New York 
300 Quarropas Street 
White Plains, NY 10601 
Re: United States v. Nicholas Tartaglione, S4 16 Cr. 832 (KMK) 
Dear Judge Karas: 
I write to request that the Court promptly conduct an evidentiary hearing to ascertain the 
circumstances surrounding the Government's failure to preserve the video surveillance footage at 
the Metropolitan Correctional Center, which captured the hallway outside of the cell that Mr. 
Tartaglione shared with Jeffrey Epstein at the time Mr. Epstein attempted to commit suicide 
between the late hours of July 22, 2019 and the early morning hours of July 23, 2019. Since the 
date of the incident, Mr. Tartaglione has firmly and consistently maintained that he acted 
appropriately in all respects, and footage of the incident, therefore, would have been exculpatory, 
as it would have corroborated Mr. Tartaglione's account of events. 
Accordingly, we ask that the Court conduct a hearing to determine (1) how the video was 
destroyed, who was responsible for its destruction, and why it was not preserved; (2) whether 
there are any witnesses who reviewed the video footage prior to its destruction who can describe 
what they observed, and, in turn, preserve at least some the video's exculpatory value; and (3) 
whether and to what extent the destruction of the video was deliberate or reckless, and whether 
there was any bad faith on the part of the Government in connection with the video's destruction. 
We have reviewed the letters filed by the Government, dated December 19, 2019 and 
January 9, 2020, which purport to explain why the video footage no longer insists. The 
explanation offered, however, is inadequate as it is non-specific, unswom, and untested. Aside 
from mentioning "MCC staff" and acknowledging the defense's July 25, 2019 preservation 
request, the Government has not provided the name of a single individual responsible for the loss 
of the video. Given that the information concerning the destruction of the video, like the video 
itself, has at all times been in the exclusive control of the Bureau of Prisons, the individuals 
EFTA00016736
--- PAGE 2 ---
Case 7:16-cr-00832-KMK Document 186 Filed 01/13/20 Page 2 of 5 
responsible for the video's destruction, as well as all relevant documents, memoranda, or emails 
concerning the matter, are likewise completely inaccessible to the defense. As a result, the 
defense has no means of conducting its own independent inquiry into the circumstances under 
which the video has been lost, or from securing sworn affidavits from implicated individuals. In 
other words, absent a court-ordered evidentiary hearing, neither the defense nor the Court has 
any means by which to independently determine what took place and how the evidence was 
destroyed, despite the request to preserve it. The individuals involved in the video's destruction 
should therefore be ordered to appear and give testimony, and the Government should disclose to 
the defense any and all relevant written materials. 
A defendant in a capital case has a constitutionally protected right to provide the jury 
with mitigating evidence. Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 393 (2000). The Eighth Amendment 
prohibits the infliction of cruel and unusual punishment, and in a capital matter, while the death 
penalty may in certain cases be appropriate, it can only be imposed after adequate consideration 
of factors that might warrant mercy. Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U.S. 280, 305 (1976); 
California v. Brown, 479 U.S. 538, 554 (1987). The jury, therefore, must "'not be precluded 
from considering, as a mitigating factor, any aspect of a defendant's character or record and any 
of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than 
death."' Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U.S. 104, 110 (1982) (quoting Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 
604 [1978]). See also Eddings, at 113-14 (1982) (both due process and the Eighth Amendment 
require that the defendant be able to present to the jury all relevant mitigating evidence during 
the penalty phase of a capital case). The presentation of mitigating evidence, after all, allows for 
the consideration of "compassionate or mitigating factors stemming from the diverse frailties of 
humankind ... [which is] a constitutionally indispensable part of the process of inflicting the 
penalty of death." Woodson, 428 U.S. at 304. In this respect, the Government's loss or 
destruction of evidence that mitigates punishment in a capital case -- especially where there has 
been an express preservation request, and an acknowledgement of that request with assurances of 
preservation -- requires a full factual record and, if appropriate, sanctions for the loss of the 
evidence. 
The Supreme Court held in Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87 (1963), that "the 
suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to the accused upon request violates due 
process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good 
faith or bad faith of the prosecution." A defendant seeking remedial relief based on the 
spoilation -- rather than the suppression -- of Brady material, however, must make a two-pronged 
showing that the evidence possessed exculpatory value "that was apparent before [it] was 
destroyed" and was "of such a nature that the defendant would be unable to obtain comparable 
evidence by other reasonably available means," California v. Trombetta, 467 U.S. 479, 489 
(1984), and must also show that the government acted in bad faith. United States v. Greenburg, 
835 F.3d 295, 303 (2d Cir. 2016); United States v. Rastelli, 870 F.2d 822, 833 (2d Cir. 1989). In 
other words, when the Government fails to preserve evidentiary material that is "potentially 
useful," such failure "does not violate due process 'unless a criminal defendant can show bad 
faith' on the part of the Government. Illinois v. Fisher, 540 U.S. 544, 547-48 (2004) (quoting 
Arizona v. Youngblood, 488 U.S. 51, 58 [1988]). The defense maintains that the lost surveillance 
footage was exculpatory with respect to any potential future penalty proceedings, and would 
have provided powerful evidence mitigating against the penalty of death. Alternatively, the lost 
EFTA00016737
--- PAGE 3 ---
Case 7:16-cr-00832-KMK Document 186 Filed 01/13/20 Page 3 of 5 
footage would also be material and relevant to rebut any aggravating evidence offered by the 
Government during penalty proceedings that Mr. Tartaglione was likely to be a danger in prison. 
Either way, even if the lost footage can only be characterized as potentially useful, the record 
clearly shows that evidence has been lost and that the loss is "chargeable to the state," United 
States v. Rahman, 189 F.3d 88, 139 (quoting Colon v. Kuhlman, 865. F.2d 29, 30 [2d Cir. 1988]), 
and a hearing, therefore, is required. See, e.g., United States v. Soriano, 401 F.Supp.3d 396 
(E.D.N.Y. 2019) (evidentiary hearing conducted to determine circumstances under which 
Customs and Border Protection agents destroyed property in which drugs were found); United 
States v. Bufalino, 432 F.Supp. 651 (S.D.N.Y. 1977) (evidentiary hearing conducted to determine 
circumstances under which the government destroyed witness's taped conversation with 
defendant). 
See also United States v. Grammatikos, 633 F.2d 1013 (2d Cir.1980) 
("appropriateness and extent of sanctions [where evidence is lost] depends upon a case-by-case 
assessment of the government's culpability for the loss, together with a realistic appraisal of its 
significance when viewed in light of its nature, its bearing upon critical issues in the case and the 
strength of the government's untainted proof').' 
Here, on July 23, 2019 at approximately 1:27 a.m., Jeffrey Epstein attempted to commit 
suicide inside of his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, which, at the time, he was 
sharing with Mr. Tartaglione. Within 72 hours, on July 25, 2019, at 11:54 a.m., counsel sent the 
following email to Adam Johnson of the Bureau of Prisons ("BOP"): 
I write to request the preservation of all video surveillance that captures the 
hallway outside of Tartaglione's cell on the date and time of the Epstein incident 
that is currently being investigated. I believe that the date and time is July 23 
during the early morning hours. Accordingly, I would ask that all video 
surveillance from July 22 at 11 pm to July 23 at 4 am is preserved. If it is your 
understanding that the incident occurred at a different time, please let me know 
and preserve the relevant footage, including an hour before the incident and an 
hour afterwards. If the responding officers were wearing body cameras that 
captured the inside of the cell in the aftermath of the incident, I am requesting that 
such footage also be preserved. We will be official requesting this material 
through the appropriate means, but please consider this email a formal 
preservation request. 
(7/25/19 Leisenring Email). 
I Courts have held that bureaucratic error alone is not a sufficient basis to infer bad faith on the part of the 
government in its destruction of potentially exculpatory evidence, see Arizona v. Youngblood, 488 U.S. 55 (1988) 
(lab technician's failure to refrigerate, and, therefore, preserve, semen samples from a sexual assault victim's 
clothing that "might have completely exonerated [the defendant]" was not indicative of bad faith); United States v. 
Hunley, 476 Fed. Appx. 897 (2d Cir. 2012) (police department's failure to place a hold on lab's regularly scheduled 
destruction of firearm was not willful or malicious); and People v. Tyree, 279 Fed.Appx. 31 (2d Cir. 2008) (no bad 
faith where evidence was destroyed because of a "gap in the bureaucratic network"), and similarly, the Government 
does not act in bad faith when evidence is destroyed in accordance with normal practice or because there is a 
specific need to discard the evidence. United States v. Soriano, 401 F.Supp.3d 396, 401 (E.D.N.Y. 2019). On the 
other hand, if the Government destroys evidence when it has notice of its potential exculpatory value, and the 
destruction is not inadvertent, negligent, or pursuant to standard procedure, or when the circumstances under which 
the evidence is discarded negate any innocent explanation for the Government's conduct, the Government acts in 
bad faith. Soriano, 401 F.Supp.3d at 401. 
EFTA00016738

Case 7:16-cr-00832-KMK Document 186 Filed 01/13/20 Page 4 of 5 
At 1:59 p.m., Mr. Johnson responded: "I have asked the appropriate staff to preserve the 
requested video footage. Please be advised MCC staff do not have body cameras." 
Five months later, on December 18, 2019, counsel advised the Court that despite 
counsel's prompt and express preservation request, the Government had informed counsel that 
the recordings at issue had been destroyed (12/18/19 Proceedings: 6). 
Explaining, the 
Government stated that based on conversations with other members of the United States 
Attorney's Office, their understanding was that although the video did at one time exist, it had 
not been preserved (12/18/19 Proceedings: 7-8). The Government also added, however, that the 
Government was still awaiting further information from BOP, stating: "We then received a 
follow-up email, and we are working with BOP to determine what is the status of the video that 
they're asking us about . . and [w]hether it ever existed, whether it was preserved (12/18/19 
Proceedings: 8-9). 
The very next day, December 19, 2019, the Government's understanding of the status of 
the video footage changed, as the Government advised the Court that prosecutors "had confirmed 
with MCC staff that the video was preserved by MCC staff upon defense counsel's request in 
July 2019," that "the Government [wa]s in the process of obtaining a copy of the video from the 
MCC," and that "[o]nce the Government obtains a copy of the video, the Government [would] 
make it available for counsel's review at the United States Attorney's Office" (12/19/19 Letter). 
Then, on January 9, 2020, the Government's position on the video flip-flopped yet again, 
when prosecutors advised the Court that despite the Government's recent understanding that the 
video had been preserved, and that the Government was working to obtain a copy from MCC, 
"the Government ha[d] learned that the MCC inadvertently preserved the video from the wrong 
tier within the MCC, and, as a result, video from outside the defendant's cell on July 22 — 23, 
2019 (Le. the requested video) no longer exists" (1/9/20 Letter: 1). Further, the Government 
explained, "the backup system in place that housed all video for the Special Housing Unit, 
including the video requested by defense counsel . . . no longer exists . . . and has not since at 
least August 2019 as a result of technical errors" (1/9/20 Letter: 2).2
Respectfully, the Government's fluid account of the efforts that were made to preserve 
this critical mitigating evidence are deeply troubling and demand that an explanation be given 
via sworn testimony. The exculpatory value of the video footage -- i.e. efforts made by Mr. 
Epstein, of course, was found dead in a different cell on August 10, 2019, having been moved from the cell he 
shared with Tartaglione after his suicide attempt. 
Questions for the hearing include, but are not limited to the following: Who did Johnson speak to when he advised 
MCC "staff' to preserve the video; what actions did said staff member or members then take? Was Johnson's 
directive made via email, over the telephone, via written directive, or in person? Was (or is) there a systematic 
procedure for the preservation or the destruction of evidence at the MCC? Who actually viewed the footage prior to 
its destruction? Are there protocols in place at MCC with respect to evidence preservation? What other members of 
the United States Attorney's Office were consulted as part of the Government's efforts to ascertain the status of the 
video? Who was responsible for keeping a record of the cell number that Mr. Tartaglione and Mr. Epstein shared, 
and who entered the cell number in the MCC's computer system? Was the cell number recorded incorrectly as to 
both Tartaglione and Epstein? Were the digital records ever actually checked for accuracy? Who was the MCC staff 
member who initially confirmed that the video had been preserved? When was the FBI first conducted about 
EFTA00016739
--- PAGE 5 ---
Case 7:16-cr-00832-KMK Document 186 Filed 01/13/20 Page 5 of 5 
Tartaglione to alert BOP staff that Mr. Epstein was in distress, and to secure assistance for 
Epstein -- would have been immediately apparent from the video; the evidence was, and remains, 
unattainable by any other means; and the permanent loss of the footage, which at all times, upon 
information and belief, was in the complete and exclusive control of the BOP, and appears to 
have occurred notwithstanding an express preservation directive from the MCC's legal counsel, 
is clearly chargeable to the Government. Furthermore, the loss of this material evidence is 
exceedingly prejudicial on the question of punishment, as Mr. Tartaglione has, from the 
beginning, denied inflicting any harm on Mr. Epstein whatsoever, and in fact -- and much to the 
contrary -- has insisted that upon observing Mr. Epstein in physical distress, he tried to help Mr. 
Epstein and called to the guards on duty for assistance. 
In sum, evidence that Mr. Tartaglione, in an institutional setting, demonstrated concern 
for the life of his cellmate, took steps to aid a fellow inmate in distress, and summoned staff for 
assistance, is a factor that, in a jury's mind, may weigh against the imposition of the death 
penalty. The video footage is mitigating evidence that Mr. Tartaglione, should he be convicted, 
would have had a due process and Eighth Amendment right to present. Accordingly, sworn 
witness testimony explaining the apparent loss of this evidence is necessary and appropriate.

REQUEST TO FILE PARTIALLY 
UNDER SEAL 
Re: 
United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 (RMB) 
Dear Judge Berman: 
The Government respectfully submits this letter to provide the Court with additional 
information in response to the Court's questions at the detention hearing held on July 15, 2019 
(the "Detention Hearing"). 
I. Payments to Potential Witnesses' 
In a July 12, 2019 letter, the Government informed the Court that the Government had 
recently obtained records from a financial institution ("Institution-1") that appeared to show the 
defendant had made suspicious payments shortly after the Miami Herald began publishing, on 
approximately November 28, 2018, a series of articles relating to the defendant, his alleged sexual 
misconduct, and the circumstances under which he entered into a non-prosecution agreement 
("NPA") with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida in 2007. The same 
series highlighted the involvement of several of Epstein's former employees and associates in the 
alleged sexual abuse. At the Detention Hearing, the Court asked the Government to provide 
additional information about the individuals to whom these payments appear to have been made. 
First, records from Institution-1 show that on or about November 30, 2018, or two days 
after the series in the Miami Herald be:an, the defendant wired $100,000 from a trust account he 
controlled to 
, an individual named as 
a potential co-conspirator—and for whom Epstein obtained protection in—the NPA. This 
individual was also named and featured prominently in the Herald series. 
Second, the same records show that just three days later on or about December 3, 2018, 
the defendant wired $250,000 from the same trust account to 
, who was 
For the reasons set forth at the Detention Hearing, and with the consent of the Court, the 
Government is redacting the identities of these individuals in the publicly filed version of this 
letter. 
EFTA00016748

also named as a potential co-conspirator—and for whom Epstein also obtained protection in—the 
NPA. This individual is also one of the employees identified in the Indictment, which alleges that 
she and two other identified employees facilitated the defendant's trafficking of minors by, among 
other things, contacting victims and scheduling their sexual encounters with the defendant at his 
residences in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Florida. This individual was also named and featured 
prominently in the Herald series. 
II. Police Report 
During the Detention Hearing, the parties referenced a redacted copy of a Palm Beach 
police report, which was annexed to the Government's July 12, 2019 detention memorandum. At 
the Court's request, the Government has provided a supplemental copy of the police report 
previously filed, with information referred to in open court unredacted. The updated copy of the 
police report is attached as Exhibit A. 
III. Foreign Passport 
During the Detention Hearing, the Government informed the Court that it had recently 
learned that law enforcement agents had seized what appears to be an expired foreign passport (the 
"Foreign Passport") from a safe in the defendant's Manhattan residence during the execution of a 
search warrant on or about July 6, 2019. The Foreign Passport has a photograph that appears to 
depict the defendant, but lists a different name. Photographs of that passport are annexed hereto 
as Exhibit B. In the same safe, agents discovered what appears to be an expired United States 
passport issued to the defendant, in his true name, within three years of the date on the Foreign 
Passport. A photograph of that United States passport is annexed hereto as Exhibit C, so that the 
Court may compare the passports, both of which appear to depict the defendant. Because Exhibits 
B and C contain personally identifiable information and sensitive information relevant to the 
ongoing investigation, the Government respectfully requests that Exhibits B and C be filed under 
seal. 
The Government is attempting to obtain additional information about the Foreign Passport, 
including how it was obtained and whether the passport is genuine or fabricated. But the 
defendant's possession of what purports to be a foreign passport issued under an alias gives rise to 
the inference the defendant knows how to obtain false travel documents and/or assume other, 
foreign identities. This adds to the serious risk of flight posed by the defendant.' 
The Government has asked defense counsel to advise whether the defendant is currently, or has 
been in the past, a citizen or legal permanent resident of a country other than the United States. To 
date, defense counsel has declined to respond. Certainly if the defendant is, or has been, a citizen 
or permanent resident of another country, that would add significantly to the overwhelming 
evidence of risk of flight.

IV. Cash and Diamonds 
At the Detention Hearing, the Government informed the Court that diamonds and cash 
were seized from a safe in the defendant's Manhattan residence. The Court inquired as to the value 
of these items. After conferring with law enforcement agents who have reviewed the materials 
from the safe, the Government has learned that the safe contained more than $70,000 in cash. In 
addition, the safe contained 48 loose diamond stones, ranging in size from approximately 1 carat 
to 2.38 carats, as well as a large diamond ring. The Government is currently unaware of whether 
the defendant maintains similar stashes of cash and/or jewels at his multiple properties, or in other 
locations. Such ready cash and loose diamonds are consistent with the capability to leave the 
jurisdiction at a moment's notice. 
V. Conclusion 
For the reasons set forth herein, in the Government's July 8, 2019 and July 12, 2019 
detention memoranda, and on the record at the Detention Hearing, the Court should order that the 
defendant be detained pending trial. The defendant cannot meet his burden of overcoming the 
presumption that there is no combination of conditions that would reasonably assure his continued 
appearance in this case or protect the safety of the community were he to be released. 
Respectfully submitted, 
United States Attorney

What Jail Is Like for Jeffrey Epstein 
Now sleeping in the bottom bunk of a windowless 8-by-8-foot cell, the financier earlier was denied house arrest 
at his sprawling Manhattan townhouse 
Since his arrest on sex-trafficking charges, financier Jeffrey Epstein has spent much of his time in the bottom 
bunk of a windowless 8-by-8-foot cell, according to the lawyer of his former cellmate. 
The cell is in a wing of a federal jail in downtown Manhattan that is known as "the box" and has been the subject 
of inmate complaints about mice and insect infestations, as well as standing water on the floor, according to 
lawyers of inmates. 
Mr. Epstein's roommate until Tuesday was Nicholas Tartaglione, a retired police officer accused of killing four 
people, according to Mr. Tartaglione's lawyer, Bruce Barket. 
"It is dark and it's disgusting," Mr. Barket said of the jail cell Messrs. Epstein and Tartaglione shared. 
Mr. Epstein, 66 years old, was arrested July 6 and was later denied bail when a judge rejected his 
lawyers' request that he be placed on house arrest in his sprawling Manhattan townhouse, which is valued at $77 
million. 
Mr. Epstein had built a fortune of more than half a billion dollars by cultivating his ties to rich and powerful 
individuals. Prosecutors this month said they found a "piles of cash" and dozens of diamonds in a locked safe at 
his New York mansion. 
The financier has pleaded not guilty to sex-trafficking charges stemming from what prosecutors allege was a 
yearslong scheme from 2002 to 2005 to recruit and sexually abuse dozens of girls. 
Following his arrest, he has mostly been at the Manhattan jail, which is known as the Metropolitan Correctional 
Center. He was moved to a suicide-watch unit after being found unconscious in his cell Tuesdaymorning, 
according to people familiar with the matter.

A lawyer for Mr. Epstein declined to comment. Mr. Tartaglione was interviewed in connection with Mr. Epstein's 
injuries but had no part in them, Mr. Barket said. 
The jail houses 774 inmates, most of them awaiting trial. It has been home to such high-profile inmates 
as Mexican drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, who was sentenced earlier this month to life in prison. 
Federal records show that the current occupants include Cesar Sayoc, who pleaded guilty to sending bombs to 
prominent Democrats and is awaiting sentencing, and Sayfullo Saipov, accused of killing eight people by driving 
a truck on to a Manhattan bike path. Mr. Saipov has pleaded not guilty. 
Mr. Epstein and other inmates are allowed to leave their cells for an hour of recreation each day, as well as 
meetings with lawyers, according to a correction officer. 
Mr. Barket said that Messrs. Tartaglione and Epstein were friendly and frequently spoke while they were 
bunkmates. Mr. Tartaglione was arrested in 2016 for killing four people in Chester, N.Y. He has pleaded not 
guilty. 
Mr. Tartaglione's lawyer has been a vocal critic of the conditions in the jail, filing complaints to correction 
officials about rodents and bugs. 
Lawyers for Mr. Guzman blamed frigid temperatures, lack of clean blankets and contaminated water at the jail as 
reasons for their client's failing health. 
Serene Gregg, a case worker at the Metropolitan Correctional Center and president of the correction workers' 
union chapter, said there are mice and broken toilets and sinks. 
Representatives for the Federal Bureau of Prisons, which manages the Metropolitan Correctional Center, didn't 
respond to questions about the conditions there. 
"There is no worse place you can find yourself," Mr. Barket said.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 
The only issue before the Court is whether conditions exist that can reasonably assure 
Ms. Maxwell's appearance during this case. On this renewed application, Ms. Maxwell has put 
before the Court a significant bail package, supported by detailed submissions, which warrant 
her release on strict conditions. She and her spouse have committed to signing a bond in the full 
amount of their net worth, regardless of the ownership of the underlying assets. She has 
proffered seven additional sureties, consisting of her family and close friends, many of whom are 
U.S. citizens and long-time residents, who have come forward at great personal risk and have 
pledged meaningful assets. The government does not challenge the good faith and bona fides of 
these proposed sureties. She has provided a detailed report from a respected accounting firm, 
which was further reviewed by a former IRS special agent, setting forth a statement of her 
financial condition, supported by voluminous documentation. The government does not 
challenge the report's findings, nor its underlying documentation. She has agreed, in writing, to 
give up any right she has or could have to contest extradition and submit to all other standard 
travel restrictions. And she has noted that a key representation made by the government at the 
initial bail hearing as to the strength of its evidence is simply not accurate — 
and there is no "significant contemporaneous documentary 
evidence" that corroborates its case. 
With regard to any other defendant, this record would readily support release on strict 
bail conditions, perhaps even on consent. But this is Ghislaine Maxwell, the apparent substitute 
for Jeffrey Epstein. So, instead, in its response the government urges the Court to disregard the 
significant additional evidence proffered to the Court and further argues that a defendant cannot 
be eligible for bail (apparently on any conditions), unless she can provide an absolute guarantee 
against all risks. But this is not the legal standard. United States v. Orta, 760 F.2d 887, 888 n.4, 
EFTA00016773
--- PAGE 6 ---
892-93 (8th Cir. 1985) ("The legal standard required by the [Bail Reform] Act is one of reasonable 
assurances, not absolute guarantees."). Under, the Bail Reform Act, a defendant must be released 
unless there are "no conditions" that would reasonably assure her presence. Here, the proposed 
package satisfies the actual governing standard, and the Court should grant bail. 
ARGUMENT 
I. 
The Government Concedes that Its Case Relies Almost Exclusively on the 
Testimony of Three Witnesses 
In evaluating the strength of the government's case in its prior ruling, the Court relied on 
the government's proffer that the testimony of the three accusers would be corroborated by 
"significant contemporaneous documentary evidence." (Tr. 82 (emphasis added)). The 
government now expressly retreats from this position. It is abundantly clear from the 
government's response that it has no "significant contemporaneous documentary evidence"—in 
fact, it has virtually no documentary corroboration at all—and that its case against Ms. Maxwell 
is based almost exclusively on the recollections of the three accusers, who remain unidentified, 
concerning events that took place over 25 years ago. Moreover, the government offers no 
specificity about when within the four-year period of the charged conspiracy the alleged 
incidents of abuse took place. This, alone, is grounds for the Court to reconsider its prior ruling. 
The few examples of documentary corroboration referenced by the government—which 
are the same examples that the government touted at the initial hail hearing pertain to Epstein, 
not Ms. Maxwell. The government concedes that 
." (Gov. Mem. at 11 (emphasis added)). The 
government further states that "
I=1=1 
." (Id. 
(emphasis added)). The strength of the government's case against Jeffrey Epstein is not at issue 
EFTA00016774
--- PAGE 7 ---
here. Whether or not the accusers' recollections as to Epstein are corroborated is irrelevant to 
the strength of the evidence against Ms. Maxwell. 
The only purported corroboration that pertains in any way to Ms. Maxwell is of marginal 
value. The government references 
• 
(Id. at I I). But even the government concedes that, at best, 
It is clear that the only evidence that Ms. Maxwell allegedly "groomed" the accusers or 
knowingly facilitated or participated in Epstein's sexual abuse of minors will come solely from 
the testimony of the three accusers. The government's case against Ms. Maxwell therefore rests 
entirely on the credibility and reliability of these three witnesses.2 Moreover, the substantive 
counts (Counts Two and Four) are based on the testimony of only one witness, Minor Victim-1. 
It is also telling that the government does not even attempt to rebut the defense's assertion that it 
did not begin issuing subpoenas for documents related to Ms. Maxwell until just after the death 
of Jeffrey Epstein. This confirms that the case against Ms. Maxwell was assembled after the fact 
I The government also proffers that they will have "additional witnesses." (Gov. Mem. at I I). But these are not 
"outcry" witnesses who will corroborate a contemporaneous account of abuse from one or more of the accusers. 
Instead, they will testify only that "both [Ms. Maxwell] and Epstein knew and interacted with certain minor victims 
when those victims were minors." (Id.). Again, the fact that Ms. Maxwell may have "met and interacted with" 
someone when they were a minor proves absolutely nothing. 
One of the witnesses has submitted a letter to the Court. While the CVRA permits the right to be heard, the letter 
should be given no legal weight in the Court's bail analysis. See United States v. Turner, 367 F. Supp. 2d 319, 331-
(E.D.N.Y. 2005) 
EFTA00016775
--- PAGE 8 ---
as a substitute for its prosecution of Epstein.3 The government's case is not what it represented 
to the Court at the initial bail hearing, which should weigh heavily in favor of granting bail.°
II. 
The Government Has Not Carried Its Burden 
A. 
The Government Asks the Court to Ignore Ms. Maxwell's Substantial 
Ties to the United States, Including Her Spouse 
The government incorrectly argues that the renewed bail application offers no new 
information and that the Court was "already aware of the defendant's friends and family in 
the United States. (Gov. Mem. at 13). The government ignores that, since the initial bail 
hearing, Ms. Maxwell's spouse has come forward as a co-signor and has submitted a 
detailed letter describing his committed relationship with Ms. Maxwell for over four years 
and the important role she has played, and continues to play, 
. It also ignores that several of Ms. Maxwell's closest friends and family, many of 
whom are U.S. citizens and residents, have also come forward, at considerable personal risk, 
to support her bond with pledges of assets or letters of support. This information, which 
was not available to the Court at the time of the initial hearing, demonstrates Ms. Maxwell's 
strong ties to this country and weighs heavily in favor of bail. 
Rather than address the merits, the government attempts to dismiss the significance 
of Ms. Maxwell's relationship with her spouse, noting that Ms. Maxwell told Pretrial 
Services that she was in the process of getting a divorce and that her spouse did not step 
forward as a co-signer at the initial bail hearing. (Id. at 13-14). The government is entirely 
Moreover, the government failure to request 
regardless of whether it was legally obligated to 
do so, shows that the government has accepted the accusers' accounts without serious scrutiny. Given the 
governownes ongoine B ndr ohlieations. it is unsettling that the etwernment would simply nee 
Contrary to the government's assertion, the defense has not abandoned our legal challenges to the indictment. 
(Gov. Mem. at 10 n.1). We believe we have strong arguments that have only gotten stronger with the production of 
discovery. We will be making those arguments to the Court in our pretrial motions to be filed next month. 
EFTA00016776
--- PAGE 9 ---
mistaken. Prior to her arrest, Ms. Maxwell and her spouse had discussed the idea of getting 
a divorce as an additional way to create distance between Ms. Maxwell and her spouse to 
protect him 
from the terrible consequences of being associated with her. 
Nevertheless, in the weeks following the initial bail hearing, 
She and her spouse therefore had no reason to continue 
discussing divorce, which neither of them wanted in the first place. Nor was there any 
reason for her spouse to refrain from stepping forward as a co-signer. In sum, the 
government has offered nothing but unsupported innuendo to suggest that Ms. Maxwell's 
relationship with her spouse 
is not a powerful tie to this country. 
The government's assertion that Ms. Maxwell must not have a close relationship 
wi 
and belied by the facts. (Gov. Mem. at 14). As her spouse explains, 
" (Ex. A ¶ 12). 
particularly callous 
B. 
Ms. Maxwell Has Thoroughly Disclosed Her Finances and Pledged All of 
Her and Her Spouse's Assets in Support of Her Bond 
The government's attempts to rebut the financial condition report are unavailing. 
Significantly, the government does not contest the accuracy of the report, nor the 
voluminous supporting documentation. In fact, the government has proffered nothing that 
calls into question the report's detailed account of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse's assets for 
the last five years, which addresses one of the Court's principal reasons for denying bail. 
Rather than question the report itself, the government attempts to argue that Ms. 
Maxwell deceived the Court and Pretrial Services about her assets. (Gov. Mem. at 22-23). 
EFTA00016777
--- PAGE 10 ---
The report shows nothing of the sort. Ms. Maxwell, who was sitting in a jail cell at the time. 
was asked by Pretrial Services to estimate her assets. Accordingly, she gave her best 
estimate of the assets she held in her own name, which the government concedes she did 
with remarkable accuracy considering that she had not reviewed her financial statements.5
The government's arguments further confirm that it has lost all objectivity and will 
view at any fact involving Ms. Maxwell in the worst possible light. For example, the 
government asserts that Ms. Maxwell has demonstrated "sophistication in hiding her assets" 
and characterizes her transfers to a trust as "funneling" assets to her spouse to "hide her true 
wealth." (Id. at 24). There is nothing unusual, let alone nefarious or even particularly 
sophisticated about transferring assets into a trust or a spouse. Indeed, Ms. Maxwell fully 
disclosed these transactions on her joint tax returns. More importantly, all of the assets 
disclosed in the financial report, whether they are owned by Ms. Maxwell or her spouse, are 
included in the bond amount and are subject to forfeiture if she flees. 
The government further argues that the financial condition report shows that Ms. 
Maxwell has access to millions of dollars of "unrestrained funds" that she could use to flee 
the country and reimburse any of her sureties for the loss of their security. (Id. at 23). That 
characterization is simply untrue. First, as disclosed in the financial report, Ms. Maxwell 
has procured significant loans on the basis of a negative pledge over her London property. 
Second, the $4 million controlled by her spous 
could only be liquidated with considerable difficulty. 
The government also faults Ms. Maxwell for not including a valuation of future 
contingent assets and income that may never materialize. (Id. at 23-24). For exampleM 
Moreover, for the reasons discussed in our initial memorandum, Ms. Maxwell was reluctant to discuss anything 
about her spouse and clearly expressed her reluctance to Pretrial Services early on in the interview. 
EFTA00016778
--- PAGE 11 ---
. Similarly, the financial report does not include 
a future income stream for Ms. Maxwell or her spouse because it presents only historical 
and current assets. Even so, Ms. Maxwell has no certain future income stream. Her spouse 
and has had to liquidate his existing investments to help Ms. Maxwell. Finally, the 
reference to 
is gratuitous. Ms. Maxwell had no knowledge of 
But the larger point is this: Ms. Maxwell has proposed a substantial bail package 
with multiple co-signers and significant security. She and her spouse have pledged all of 
their assets in support of the bond. Ms. Maxwell's wealth is not a reason to deny her bail. It 
is a reason to set appropriately strict conditions that will result in significant financial 
consequences to Ms. Maxwell and her friends and family if she leaves the country. The 
proposed bail package does exactly that.°
C. 
The Government's Assertion that Ms. Maxwell Is "Adept" at Hiding and 
Therefore a Flight Risk Is Specious 
The government continues to assert the sinister narrative that Ms. Maxwell had "an 
expertise at remaining hidden," and that it would therefore be easy for her to become a fugitive. 
The government's argument that her spouse's moral suasion is diminished because Ms. Maxwell brought the 
majority of assets to the relationship is nonsensical. (Id. at 24-25). Regardless of whose mono it was to begin with, 
all of the assets of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse will be forfeited if she flees and her spouse 
will be 
left with nothing. Furthermore, the government's assertion that they could not verify the spouse's financial 
information because Ms. Maxwell did not provide his current banking information is false. (Id. at 24 n.9). The 
defense provided the spouse's current banking records and only redacted the name of the bank. 
EFTA00016779
--- PAGE 12 ---
(Gov. Mem. at 20). The government suggests that purchasing a home using a trust and providing 
a pseudonym to a real estate broker are indicative of her willingness and ability to live in hiding 
and somehow forecast Ms. Maxwell's intention to flee. (Id.). These arguments are just further 
evidence that the government will frame every fact about Ms. Maxwell in the worst possible 
light. As the defense has already argued extensively in its initial brief, these steps were borne 
out of necessity to protect Ms. Maxwell and her family from harassment and physical threats. 
Moreover, they are not predictive of flight. There is simply no basis to conclude, based on the 
measures that Ms. Maxwell was forced to take to protect herself and her family, that she would 
then willingly abandon that family to become a fugitive from justice. To the contrary, she 
remained in the country precisely to remain close to them and to defend her case. 
D. 
Extradition from France or the United Kingdom Is Highly Unlikely 
The government dismisses Ms. Maxwell's willingness to waive her extradition rights as 
to France and the United Kingdom as "meaningless" because Ms. Maxwell cannot guarantee 
with absolute certainty that either country will enforce the waiver. (Gov. Mem. at 14). The 
government misses the point: Ms. Maxwell's willingness to do everything she can to eliminate 
her ability to refuse extradition to the fullest extent possible demonstrates her firm commitment 
to remain in this country to face the charges against her and, as Ms. Maxwell's French and U.K. 
experts confirm, there is every reason to believe that both authorities would consider the waiver 
as part of any extradition request. 
In an attempt to counter William Julie's expert report stating it is "highly unlikely" that 
the French government would refuse to extradite Ms. Maxwell (Def. Mem., Ex. V at 2), the 
government attaches a letter from the French Ministry of Justice ("MOJ") that references neither 
Mr. Julie's report nor Ms. Maxwell, but states generally that the French Code of Criminal 
Procedure "absolutely prohibits" the extradition of a French national. (Gov. Mem., Ex. B). But 
EFTA00016780
--- PAGE 13 ---
as Mr. Julie's accompanying rebuttal report explains (see Ex. A), the MOJ letter ignores that the 
extradition provisions in French Code of Criminal Procedure apply only in the absence of an 
international agreement providing otherwise. (Id. at 1). This rule is necessitated by the French 
Constitution, which requires that international agreements prevail over national legislation. (Id.). 
Thus, extradition of a French national to the United States is legally permissible if the extradition 
treaty between the United States and France provides for it—which it does. (Id. at 3). 
The government's reliance on a 2006 case—in which France refused to extradite a 
French national who was also a U.S. citizen—provides no precedent as to how a French court 
would rule on an extradition request regarding Ms. Maxwell because, as Mr. Julie notes, the 
United States did not challenge the refusal in the French courts. (Id. at 2-3). Nor does it 
undermine Mr. Julie's opinion that, in the unusual circumstance where a citizen of both countries 
has executed an extradition waiver and then fled to France in violation of bail conditions set by a 
U.S. court, it is "highly unlikely" that an extradition decree would not be issued. (Id. at 3). 
The government offers no rebuttal to the opinion of Ms. Maxwell's U.K. extradition 
expert, David Perry. Nor does it dispute Mr. Perry's opinion that Ms. Maxwell would be "highly 
unlikely" to successfully resist extradition from the United Kingdom, that her waiver would be 
admissible in any extradition proceeding, and that—contrary to the government's representation 
at the initial bail hearing (Tr. 27)—bail would be "extremely unlikely." (See Def. Mem. Ex. U at 
39). Mr. Perry's addendum opinion (attached as Ex. B) reiterates these points, opining that the 
waiver would be "a highly relevant factor" in the U.K. proceeding, both to the likelihood of 
extradition and to the likelihood of bail while the proceeding is pending. (Id. ¶ 3).7
Nor, as the government suggests, does the Secretary of State have general "discretion to deny extradition" after a 
court has entered a final extradition order. (See Gov. Mem. at 19). That discretion is limited to a handful of 
exceptional circumstances that would likely be inapplicable to Ms. Maxwell's case. (Id .11 4.5). 
EFTA00016781
--- PAGE 14 ---
Finally, the government's argument that Ms. Maxwell could always flee to some country 
other than the United Kingdom and France holds her—and any defendant—to an impossible 
standard, which is not the standard under the Bail Reform Act. (See Gov. Mem. at 19). By the 
government's reasoning, no defendant with financial means to travel could be granted bail, 
because there would always be a possibility that they could flee to another country (even if they 
had no ties there), and there could never be an assurance that any extradition waiver would be 
enforced. However, "Section 3142 does not seek ironclad guarantees." United States v. Chen, 
820 F. Supp. 1205, 1208 (N.D. Cal. 1992). To the extent that Ms. Maxwell's ties to France and 
the United Kingdom—where she has not lived for nearly 30 years—create a flight risk, her 
extradition waivers along with the substantial bail package proposed reasonably cure it.8
E. 
The Recent COVID Surge at MDC Further Justifies Bail 
The government suggests that the Court ignore COVID concerns because Ms. Maxwell, 
though quarantined because of contact with an officer who tested positive, did not become 
infected. This ignores the daily (sometimes multiple) inspections of Ms. Maxwell's mouth, 
which heightens her risk of contracting the deadly virus, which has now surged to 113 positive 
cases in the MDC. Further, Deputy Captain B. Houtz recently issued a memo stating that "[i]t 
has not been determined whether legal calls and legal visits will continue." As the Court is well 
aware, legal visits with Ms. Maxwell already have been suspended. Should legal calls also be 
discontinued, her constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel will be further eroded. 
CONCLUSION 
For the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that the Court order her 
release on bail pursuant to the strict conditions she has proposed. 
S Any incentive Ms. Maxwell might have to flee to France has been greatly diminished by the recent arrest in France 
of Jean-Luc Brunel, who reportedly is under investigation for alleged sexual assaults by Jeffrey Epstein. See, e.g.,

Exhibit A 
EFTA00016784
--- PAGE 2 ---
WILLIAM 
JULIE 
AVOCAT A LA COUR 
December 18, 2020, Paris. 
Response to the government's memorandum in opposition to the defendant's renewed 
motion for release. 
I was asked to review the United States government's memorandum and notably pages 15 to 
alongside the French Minister of Justice's letter dated 11 December 2020 produced as 
Exhibit B to this memorandum. 
The French Minister of Justice's letter (Exhibit B) 
The letter of the French Minister of Justice, on which the US government relies to argue that 
the French government does not extradite its citizens outside the European Union and thus to 
the United States, quotes Article 696-2 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure, which 
provides that France can extradite "any person not having French nationality". 
It remains unclear whether the author of such letter had actually access to my opinion which is 
not even quoted, and more generally it seems the letter responds to a question which 
unexpectedly was not disclosed. 
The letter fails to mention, however, that Article 696 of the same Code provides that provisions 
of the French Code of Criminal Procedure on the conditions of extradition apply in the absence 
of an international agreement providing otherwise (Article 696 of the French Code of 
Criminal Procedure: "In the absence of an international agreement stipulating otherwise, the 
conditions, procedure and effects of extradition shall be determined by the provisions of this 
chapter'. These provisions shall also apply to matters which would not have been regulated by 
international conventions"). The provisions of Article 696 of the French Code of Criminal 
Procedure are a reminder that under Article 55 of the French Constitution, international 
agreements prevail over national legislation (Article 55 of the French Constitution: "Treaties 
or agreements that have been duly ratified or approved have, upon their publication, an 
authority superior to that of laws, subject, for each agreement or treaty, to its application by 
the other party"). It follows from these provisions that the key question is whether France may 
extradite a French national under the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France and/or 
under the Extradition Treaty between the European Union and the USA, not whether France 
extradites its citizens under French legislation. 
In accordance with this French constitutional rule, the administrative circular of 11 March 2004, 
published by the French Ministry of Justice, which aims at specifying how the then recently 
amended legal provisions regarding extradition should apply and be understood, states the 
following: "Article 696 of the Code of Criminal Procedure reaffirms this principle of 
I The relevant chapter includes Articles 696- I to Article 696.47-1 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure, 
and thus includes Article 696.2.

JULIE 
AVOCAT A LA COUR 
subsidiarity of domestic law in relation to international instruments as stated by the 
aforementioned law of 10 March 1927: the legislative provisions on extradition are applicable 
only in the silence or in the absence of international conventions.' 
It follows from the provisions of Article 696 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure that the 
key question is whether France may extradite a French national under the Extradition Treaty 
between the USA and France and/or under the Extradition Treaty between the European Union 
and the USA, not whether France may extradite its citizens under French legislation. 
As previously outlined, the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France does not preclude 
the French government from extraditing a French national and must therefore be distinguished 
from a number of other international agreements signed by France which contain a clear 
prohibition to that extent. The Treaty between the USA and France gives the French 
government discretion as to whether or not to extradite its own citizens to the USA. 
It is noted that the letter of the French Minister does not provide any answer on this issue. 
The DOJ Memorandum and the Peterson Case 
In support of its argument that the French government would not extradite Ms Ghislaine 
Maxwell to the USA, the government relies on the case of Mr Hans Peterson, a dual French 
American citizen whose extradition to the US was denied by France in 2007. 
The Peterson precedent should only be cited with great caution. First, I am not aware that this 
case has given rise to a published judicial decision, therefore it should not be interpreted as the 
support of any legal rule or principle. In addition, in regards to the documents that the DOJ has 
referred to in its memorandum, I doubt that a judicial decision has ever occurred in this case: 
as mentioned by the 2007 letter of US Senators Richard J. Durbin and Barack Obama to the 
French Minister of Foreign Affairs, the French Minister of Justice communicated its decision 
refusing extradition on August 22nd 2007, only a few days after the suspect was arrested (at the 
beginning of August 2007). This decision is not a Court decision but a discretionary decision 
from the French Ministry of Justice. It actually seems very unlikely that a court decision could 
have been rendered in this timeframe. This indicates that the case must not have been handed 
on to the court by the Ministry of Justice in the earliest stage of the extradition process. 
A refusal to extradite may possibly be challenged by the requesting government before the 
French Conseil d'Etat, which is the French Supreme Court for administrative matters, as for 
example the United Kingdom and Hong Kong successfully challenged a decision from the 
French authorities not to extradite an individual whose extradition they had requested (Conseil 
d'Etat, 15 October1993, no. 142578). In the Peterson case, the American government did not

JULIE 
AVOCAT A LA COUR 
challenge the refusal before French courts, while such challenge could have led to a judicial 
review of the request, in accordance with the ordinary extradition procedure. 
Secondly, in the absence of a published judicial decision, it is impossible to determine what the 
outcome of this case would have been if it had come before the courts. 
Third, as was rightly pointed out by US Senators Richard J. Durbin and Barack Obama in their 
aforementioned letter to the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, which the government cites in 
its memorandum: 
"Article 3 of the Extradition Treaty between the United States and France provides in 
pertinent pan that "There is no obligation upon the Requested State to grant the 
extradition of a person who is a national of the Requested State". While this Article 
does not require the extradition of a national to a requesting state, it also does not 
appear to preclude extradition. To the extent there is discretion available in such 
extradition decisions, we urge the French government to exercise that discretion in 
favor of extradition". 
I am satisfied that this is the right interpretation of Article 3, as this is exactly the conclusion I 
came to in my first report. To the extent that there is a discretion, there can be no absolute rule 
against the extradition of nationals under French law. A discretionary power is not a legal rule. 
Indeed, there is no constitutional principle against the extradition of nationals. For these 
reasons, the Peterson case does not alter my view that under the specific and unique facts of 
this case, it is highly unlikely that the French government would refuse to issue and execute an 
extradition decree against Ms. Maxwell, particularly if Ms. Maxwell has signed an irrevocable 
waiver in the USA. 
Finally, if an extradition request were to be issued against a French citizen today, the obligations 
of the French government under the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France would 
also need to be read in light of the Agreement on extradition between the European Union and 
the United States of America, which came into force on February Is', 2010, several years after 
the Peterson case. Article 1 of this Agreement, which enhances cooperation between 
Contracting Parties, provides that: "The Contracting Parties undertake, in accordance with the 
provisions of this Agreement, to provide for enhancements to cooperation in the context of 
applicable extradition relations between the Member States and the United States of America 
governing extradition of offenders". The existence of this Agreement would need to be taken 
into account by the French government in the exercise of its discretion as to whether or not to 
grant the extradition of a French national to the USA.

Exhibit B 
EFTA00016788
--- PAGE 2 ---
IN THE MATTER OF AN OPINION 
ON THE EXTRADITION LAW OF ENGLAND AND WALES 
RE GHISLAINE MAXWELL 
ADDENDUM OPINION 
1. 
This Addendum Opinion is provided in response to the Government's Memorandum 
in Opposition to the Defendant's Renewed Motion to Release dated 16 December 
2020, insofar as it pertains to matters of English extradition law and practice. 
2. 
The primary conclusions of the Opinion dated 8 October 2020 (`the Opinion') 
remain unchanged, namely: (a) in the majority of cases, proceedings in England and 
Wales in relation to US extradition requests are concluded in under two years; (b) it 
is virtually certain that bail would be refused in an extradition case in circumstances 
where the requested person had absconded from criminal proceedings in the United 
States prior to trial and in breach of bail; and (c) on the basis of the information 
currently known, it is highly unlikely' that Ghislaine Maxwell would be able 
successfully to resist extradition to the United States in relation to the charges in the 
superseding indictment dated 7 July 2020. In addition to those conclusions, the 
following three points may be made. 
3. 
First, as noted in the Opinion2, Ms Maxwell's waiver of extradition would be 
admissible in any extradition proceedings in England and Wales. While such a 
document cannot compel a requested person to consent to their extradition once in 
the United Kingdom, the document would be a highly relevant factor in any 
contested extradition proceedings. In particular: 
(a) If Ms Maxwell were to rely on such a waiver to secure bail in the United 
States and then, having absconded, renege on the undertakings in that 
The Government observes, at p.16 of the Motion, that this leaves open a "possibility" that extradition could be 
resisted. Absolute certainty in any legal context is rare but the practical effect of the conclusion in the Opinion is 
that, at this stage and on the basis of the information currently known, it is difficult to conceive of circumstances 
in which Ms Maxwell could successfully resist extradition, and her extradition would be a virtual foregone 
conclusion. 
Opinion, para. 39. 
EFTA00016789
--- PAGE 3 ---
document to seek to resist her extradition, bail would almost certainly be 
refused for the duration of the extradition proceedings. 
(b) The majority of the bars that might be relied upon by Ms Maxwells require 
the extradition judge to make a finding that extradition would be 
oppressive. Quite apart from the other factors rendering those bars 
unavailable to Ms Maxwell, as set out in the Opinion, it is difficult to 
conceive of circumstances in which a finding of oppression could be made 
in relation to the serious charges faced by Ms Maxwell in circumstances 
where she had absconded from the United States and was contesting her 
extradition in breach of good faith undertakings relied upon to secure her 
bail. Similar considerations apply to the balancing exercise required in 
assessing whether extradition would breach the right to family life under 
Article 8 of the ECHR. The remaining bars to extradition and human rights 
bars are unlikely to be available to Ms Maxwell for the reasons given in 
the Opinion4. 
(c) A breach of the undertakings in the waiver of extradition would be highly 
likely to be viewed as a sign of bad faith and cause the extradition judge to 
treat any evidence given by Ms Maxwell with scepticism. 
4. 
Second, it is not correct that section 93 of the Extradition Act 2003 (`the 2003 Act') 
confers a general discretion on the Secretary of State to refuse extradition if a case is 
sent to her by the extradition judges. The ambit of the power in section 93 is 
described at paragraph 8 of the Opinion. The Secretary of State may only refuse 
extradition on the grounds provided for in that section, namely: (a) if an applicable 
bar to extradition6 is found to exist; (b) the Secretary of State is informed that the 
request has been withdrawn7; (c) there is a competing claim for extradition from 
Opinion, para. 26. Those bars are passage of time; forum; and mental and physical condition. 
Opinion, pares. 27-29 and 36.37. 
s As appears to be submitted by the Government at p.19 of the Memorandum. 
The bars to extradition that the Secretary of State must consider are: (a) the death penalty (s. 94); (b) speciality 
(s. 95); (c) earlier extradition to the United Kingdom from another territory (s. 96); and (d) earlier transfer to the 
United Kingdom from the International Criminal Court (s. 96A). 
Extradition Act 2003, s. 93(4Xa). 
EFTA00016790
--- PAGE 4 ---
another states; (d) the person has been granted asylum or humanitarian protection in 
the United Kingdoms; or (e) extradition would be against the interests of UK 
national security1s. On the information currently known, none of these bars or 
exceptions would arise in the case of Ms Maxwell. 
5. 
The exceptional nature of the Secretary of State's power is illustrated by the fact that 
it has been exercised in the favour of a requested person on only one occasion since 
the enactment of the 2003 Act, and that that single exercise of the power was based 
on grounds on which reliance may not now be placed." 
6. 
Third, as to the timescales of extradition proceedings arising from requests for 
extradition made by the Government of the United States, it is to be noted that the 
purpose of the 2003 Act to streamline extradition procedures" and, in practice, the 
legislation works to facilitate extradition. As noted in the Opinion13 the majority of 
extradition cases conclude within two years, or three months in cases where consent 
to extradition is given.

Re: United States vs. Jeffrey Epstein [19 Cr. 490 (RMB)] 
Dear Ms. 
Enclosed, please find a photograph I believe may be of Jeffrey Epstein with an underage female. 
I took the photo across from St. Patrick's Cathedral, on the same corner as the couple. I took the 
photo because the woman seemed to be underage and seemed romantically linked to the older man. 
The pair were walking closely together -he was holding a small Victoria's Secret boutique bag in his 
hand. I was concerned for the well-being of the girl. To me, she seemed to be between fourteen and 
sixteen years of age. 
At the time I took the photo, I had not heard of Jeffrey Epstein. On the following Monday, I read 
about Mr. Epstein's arrest. I am submitting it for your own analysis and review. 
The photo was taken on the corner of %1st St and stn Ave at Olympic Tower on 7 June 2019 at 
6:46PM. 
I hope it may be of help —also in ending trafficking and abuse, especially as pertains to minors. I 
apologise for the delay in submitting it — I was unsure of where to send it. 
Sincerely,

All, 
I have been getting some questions about the press conference that occurred today at Epstein's mansion, do any 
of you know that was about? Our media affairs department has been getting questions. In addition, our Victim 
Specialists have been fielding calls from irate victims who weren't notified.

Hey just passing this along from FBI, in case

victims services very upset that our office didn't notify them that there was going to be a press conference at Epstein's

Mr. Geoffrey S. Berman 
Maybe this Infos could help you in the case of Jeffrey Epstein. 
Epstein had an austrian passport and worked also for the hapsburg Group (manafort Alfred gusenbauer and Peter 
goldscheider) 
Peter Goldscheider is the key Person in the ukraine affair, with all companies, from kinto ukraine till rivada Network in 
USA. 
He is a Cold blood Killer. 
Alvaro Alves was his victim in New York on 28.11.2017 
Interesting also is the drcunstances of 2 "suicides" 
Jeffrey epstein 
both had contact to habspurg group 
Gabriel Lansky was the lawyer figthIng against Rachat Alijew. He Is also a Killer.

Betreff: introduction to Mr Peter Goldscheider, fouding partner of EPIC Invest ( investment bank from Vienna, Austin, 
mainly focused on Eastern European investments and advisory ) 
Dear David, 
The most interesting thing is what we will do with mioty and azure. 
The mission in Alta Floresta was positive. And Jedi is done. 
About something we will do not talk about, but you should know. 
In order to give you an idea how 2 boys were planning to crash europe and the euro... maybe also dollars. 
It was a coincidence that I got in contact with this plan. 
Only due to my expertise in carbon market. 
Alvaro Alves died in 28 november 2017. Strange. 
His case is under investigation by Letitia James. 
As you see Mr. Goldscheider has also kinto.com ukraine company ... 
Mr. Dmitry Firtash was working with him since some years. 
https://en.interfax.com.ua/news/economic/479485.html 
https://www.occrp.org/en/investigations/before-campaigning-for-trump-manafort-plotted-to-rig-ukraine-
telecoms-deal-leaked-emails-show 
Maybe Mr. Trump could also be more intelligent and know that maybe...Mr. Goldscheider was only using 
him... to get equitablesolution done. He runs also rivada networks... 
https://www.rivada.comMour-people
As we could avoid brexit - Mr. Merkel was working hardly on it (my friend Dominique Ristori was talking to 
her in march 2019)... the all project equitable solution has been put out of force, in october 2019, Mr. Anthonny 
Scaramucci (friend of Soros and Goldscheider) was trying also to impeach Trump. 
As you saw in the investigations about Jeffrey Epstein, our mobiles are unsafe.

Dear Mr. Jorge Costa e Silva, 
As per our conversation yesterday, I would like to introduce you to Mr. Peter Goldscheider, founding partner of EPIC Invest, an 
investment bank/private equity group based in Vienna, Austria, that focus Its Investments In Eastern European countries. 
Mr. Goldscheider•( pls see his bio below) , is a prominent financier, and one of the largest players in past privatizations of Eastern 
European companies. Pls see the website for his investment bank , EPIC Invest. 
http://www.epicinvest.com/about-epjtv
A history of his past deals can be found under " references" in the website. 
EFTA00016806
--- PAGE 3 ---
I mentioned to him about Mr .Carlos Sanchez investment in the pharmaceutical co. Galenika of Serbia, and he will be delighted to 
meet you and him, as EPIC has a very good team of professionals in Beograd. 
Also, he has a very interesting investment in Montenegro ( pls see presentation in PDF attached), that may fit Mr. Sanchez's 
investment goals. 
Please see below a list of his other investment opportunities in the US, Croatia and Montenegro. 
1. 
Information on Peter's major US investment can be found at www.rivada.com 
2. 
Information on our Croatian tourism investment is available at www.valamar.com 
Lastly, I am attaching a description of the Montenegrin high-end hospitality investment, which is 
to become Auberge Resorts' first venture into Europe. The particular appeal of this project lies in the 
team composition, which can be seen as a seal of quality, opening up the local market to an entirely 
new and high-end customer segment. Please find more information on Auberge at 
https://aubergeresons.corn/ 
Montenegro disposes of the arguably most beautiful coastline in the region and has created 
investment conditions, which guarantee maximum protection to FDI. In addition to these generally 
favorable prerequisites to a successful investment we should also mention that the political backing 
has been ensured through extensive diplomatic exchange especially with the USA. 
PETER GOLDSCHEIDER,  MANAGING PARTNER 
Peter Goldscheider has more than 25 years experience as a senior executive in the securities and finance industry. 
Before jointly establishing EPIC with Gustav Wurmbock, he was Vice President for Marketing and Sales and Board 
Member Board of Zurich Kosmos Insurance Company in Austria, and he began his professional career with IBM 
Austria, serving in a number of executive positions. 
His professional activities included serving as Chairman of the Board of EPIC (Advisors) Russia Ltd. and I. EPIC 
Holding, Prague and as President of the Board of KINTO Investments & Securities, Kyiv (www.kinto.com); he also was 
co-founder and board member of Invision AG, a Zug-based investment group focusing on leading edge technology and 
innovation companies (www.invision.ch). Peter Goldscheider is a board member of Rivada Networks 
(www.rivada.com).
Mr. Goldscheider also served a Chairman of the Supervisory Board of Ukrtelecom from August 2011 until October 
2013, since the majority (92,97%) of Ukrtelecom was acquired by ESU Ltd., EPIC's subsidiary in Ukraine. 
Mr. Goldscheider received his Ph.D. in Law from the University of Vienna Law Faculty and attended the IBM/Harvard 
Business School joint senior managers program. He is the recipient of the Golden Order of Merit of the City of Vienna 
Dear Peter, 
Please meet Mr. Jorge Costa e Silva, business partner of Mr. Carlos Sanchez, owner of the largest pharmaceutical company in Brazil , 
with investments in the US and Europe. 
http://www.mponc net br neqociosinc-farma/ems 
www.bracepharma.com 
Mr. Costa e Silva and Mr. Sanchez will be in Beograd in November, and would be interesting if you could meet while they are in the 
region.

I've attached a summary/analysis of the Epstein trust documents we received. This document incorporates the analysis of 
the trusts from 2019 I did previously. 
On the bottom, you'll see each trust has a tab and then further amendments to the trust (if any) go chronologically to the 
right. There's also key and summary tabs at the beginning of the document. 
Please let me know if you have any questions, or if you'd like me to walk you through how to use the document, in case it 
isn't clear. 
Thanks, 
p.s. I wouldn't recommend printing the document, just due to the size of the excel tables.

Thanks for flagging, M. I made a few small changes (which I highlighted since we've got a fair bit of track already) which

I apologize for the delay on this — I've added the relevant language about revocations to both the application and the 
order, and corrected a stray typo, so that stuff is good to go. But two quick things to note, not to belabor this, but — it 
doesn't look like there's any reference to the Trust Two documents — that may be because they're not referenced in any 
will? At a glance I don't see Trust Two in any of the wills, but I'd want to go back and look more thoroughly unless 
somebody already made the decision on that basis. And second, it references a 2019 Trust but I don't see any documents 
on that? I have to run out tonight but can certainly circle up with 
and/or = 
tomorrow on any of this, or just ignore 
it if I've misread.

Subject: DAILY BEAST: Prince Andrew: I'm Ready to Talk. The FBI Never Asked. Feds: Oh Yes, We Did 
Date: Wed, 05 Feb 2020 18:24:46 +0000 
Prince Andrew and the FBI were involved in a furious war of words Tuesday, after he 
denied claims made by the U.S. attorney for Manhattan, Geoffrey Berman, that he 
has refused to cooperate with American authorities investigating Jeffrey Epstein's 
alleged sexual abuse. 
Andrew said no request had been received, and he was 
ready to talk. 
However a spokesperson for Berman's office told The 
Daily Beast they stood by the prosecutor's comments, 
EFTA00016822
--- PAGE 2 ---
specifically the claim that they had "made several 
attempts to contact" Andrew's representatives. 
Andrew, 59, however, was said to be "angry and 
bewildered," according to The Daily 'I
gILaO, 
at allegations made by Berman. 
On Monday, Berman called out Andrew for giving "zero 
co-operation" to the investigation into Epstein at a 
press conference held outside Epstein's infamous front 
door. 
EFTA00016823
--- PAGE 3 ---
"Nothing could be further from the truth," a source 
described as "close to" Andrew told The Telegraph, 
"The Duke is more than happy to talk to the FBI but he 
hasn't been approached by them yet. 
"He is angry about the way this is being portrayed and 
bewildered as to why this was said in New York. It 
seems certain people are jumping the gun." 
However law-enforcement sources were adamant that 
EFTA00016824
--- PAGE 4 ---
they "stood by" Berman's remarks. 
Berman said he was taking the rare step of calling 
Andrew out by name because Andrew himself, in his 
disastrous Newsnight interview, had said: "I am willing 
to help any appropriate law-enforcement agency with 
their investigations, if required." 
While many observers saw Berman's remarks as a 
desperate (and likely unsuccessful) attempt to shame 
Prince Andrew into living up to his earlier vow, Duncan 
Levin, a former federal and New York state prosecutor 
in the Manhattan DA's office, saw something else: 
evidence of the authorities' determination to leave no 
EFTA00016825
--- PAGE 5 ---
stone unturned as they go after the rich and powerful 
global network which Epstein cultivated. 
Levin, who is now a managing partner at Tucker Levin, 
PLLC, told The Daily Beast that while it was "highly 
unusual for a prosecutor to make a public statement 
about a witness's reluctance to cooperate with law 
enforcement" there is "nothing usual about this case, in 
any way. Prince Andrew is not your typical witness, by 
any stretch of the imagination."

Looking at the logs for Epstein's jet, I'm not seeing any flights to London the entire year that she was 17 (but if you could 
double check me on that, I'd appreciate it). Do you have Epstein's immigration records from the /90s? If so, could you 
please let me know if you see any record of him flying to/from London between March 1994 and March 1995?

Lawsuit Claims Epstein Trafficked Girls in 
Caribbean Until 2018 
The attorney general of the Virgin Islands says Mr. Epstein and his associates used a database to track 
victims as young as n years old. 
A new lawsuit significantly expanded the scope of wrongdoing in which Mr. Epstein was said to have 
engaged.Credit...New York State Sex Offender Registry, via Associated Press 
EFTA00016836

By Ali Watkins 
Jan. 15, 2020Updated 2:41 p.m. ET 
New evidence shows Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused and trafficked hundreds of young women and 
girls on his private Caribbean island, some as recently as 2018, significantly expanding the scope of his 
alleged conduct, a top law enforcement official said in a lawsuit filed on Wednesday. 
Mr. Epstein, a wealthy financier who died by suicide in a Manhattan jail last year, was bringing girls as 
young as 11 and 12 to his secluded estate in the Virgin Islands, known as Little Saint James, and kept a 
computerized database to track the availability and movements of women and girls, the lawsuit said. 
The lawsuit, which was filed by Denise N. George, the attorney general of the Virgin Islands, 
broadened the dimensions of the wrongdoing in which Mr. Epstein was said to have engaged. He had 
been charged by Manhattan prosecutors in July with sexually exploiting dozens of women and girls in 
New York and Florida, but they did not point to any actions beyond 2005. 
In August, Mr. Epstein hanged himself at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, where he was being 
held awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking and conspiracy charges. Prison guards had not checked on 
him for hours on the night he died, and the circumstances surrounding his death are now the subject 
of at least three federal investigations.
In the weeks before Mr. Epstein killed himself, he and his lawyers vigorously denied the criminal 
charges. His lawyers had previously said he had been law-abiding since his 2008 conviction in Florida 
for solicitation. 
The suit was filed against Mr. Epstein's estate and seeks the forfeiture of Little Saint James and Mr. 
Epstein's second private island, Great Saint James, as well as the dissolution of numerous shell 
companies he established in the territory that officials have said acted as fronts for his sex trafficking 
enterprise. 
As part of its policies, the government of the Virgin Islands could take any assets recovered from Mr. 
Epstein's estate and consider disbursing them to women and girls who were victimized by him in the 
region, Ms. George said. 
The new accusations — which draw both from independent investigations by Ms. George's office and 
court documents from cases across the country — argue that Mr. Epstein ran a decades-long sex 
trafficking scheme that had a primary nexus in the Virgin Islands.

--- PAGE 4 ---
"Epstein clearly used the Virgin Islands and his residence in the U.S. Virgin Islands at Little Saint 
James as a way to be able to conceal and to be able to expand his activity here," Ms. George said. 
The suit underscores the legal complications of reckoning with such wide-reaching crimes as those Mr. 
Epstein is said to have committed. Ms. George's suit is the first filed against the estate by a government 
entity, but it joins a field of similar claims filed by more than a dozen women. 
It remains unclear how Mr. Epstein's assets, which are valued at about $500 million, could be 
allocated. 
"We don't have a long history of figuring out what to do in cases of human trafficking," said Bridgette 
Carr, the director of the Human Trafficking Clinic at the University of Michigan Law School, who 
consulted with Ms. George's team on the case. "I think this litigation and the courts are just trying to 
come up with the best, imperfect solution." 
Mr. Epstein's executor, Darren K. Indyke, could not immediately be reached for comment. 
Ms. George said she believed the case could chip away at the region's reputation as a notorious haven 
for the rich and powerful. 
"We will not remain complacent, and we will enforce our laws whatever way we can," Ms. George said. 
"It doesn't matter the social status of the person. It's that the laws apply equally."

The court documents said that Mr. Epstein operated with impunity for years at Little Saint James and 
Great Saint James, which he obtained through a straw purchaser in 2016. 
As recently as July 2018, Mr. Epstein refused to permit an investigator from the Virgin Island's 
Department of Justice to enter Little Saint James, claiming the island's dock was his "front door," 
according to the lawsuit. The investigator was doing routine monitoring of Mr. Epstein because he was 
a registered sex offender. 
Mr. Epstein's victims included aspiring models from South America, according to court documents. 
EFTA00016839
--- PAGE 5 ---
Mr. Epstein used a ring of associates to rotate the women and girls in and out of sexual servitude, 
using fraudulent modeling visas to transport them across state lines and international borders, the 
lawsuit said. He tracked their availability and proximity using the database, court documents said. 
The suit also said air traffic controllers in the Virgin Islands observed Mr. Epstein leaving his private 
plane in 2018 with girls who looked as young as 11. 
In one undated incident detailed in the lawsuit, a 15-year-old girl attempted to swim off Mr. Epstein's 
island and escape after she was forced to engage in sex acts with Mr. Epstein and others. The girl was 
found, and held captive on the island after he confiscated her passport, the suit said. 
Prosecutors in New York have said their investigation has continued and anyone who helped Mr. 
Epstein could face criminal charges.
In addition, the lawsuit said, Mr. Epstein embarked on several illegal construction projects at Great 
Saint James, which caused damage to native coral and wildlife. 
Continue reading  the main story 
The more than a dozen women who have filed lawsuits against Mr. Epstein's estate in New York City 
since his death have accused him of exploiting and sexually abusing them when they were young 
women and girls, according to court documents. Many are seeking financial compensation. 
The lawsuit in the Virgin Islands appears to be the first filed against the estate in that jurisdiction. Mr. 
Epstein maintained his legal permanent residence — and his estate — there. He hastily filed his will in 
a Virgin Islands court just days before he killed himself. 
Ms. George's lawsuit also seeks to head off an effort by Mr. Epstein's executor, Mr. Indyke, to turn Mr. 
Epstein's vast wealth into a victim's compensatory fund. Mr. Indyke's proposal, which is currently 
being litigated in a separate Virgin Islands case, imposes confidentiality on any claimants, Ms. George 
said. 
"The estate continues to engage in a course of conduct aimed at concealing the criminal activities of the 
Epstein enterprise," the lawsuit said. 
In a statement when that fund was first announced, Mr. Indyke said it would give victims "the 
opportunity to obtain appropriate compensation and to be heard and treated with compassion, dignity 
and respect."

restated contemporaneously with the execution of this Will, and as the same may be amended 
from time to time, to be held in accordance with the provisions comprising the Trust Agreement 
at the time of my death. 
THIRD: 
A. 
I appoint DARREN K. INDYKE, JOSEPH PAGANO and 
LAWRENCE NEWMAN to be the Executors of this Will. If any one or more of my Executors 
fails to qualify or ceases to act, I appoint JES STALEY and ANDREW FARKAS, singly and in 
the order named, as successor Executors. I authorize the last acting Executor to designate his 
successor as Executor. 
B. 
If my estate must be administered in whole or in 
part in any jurisdiction other than the state of my domicile at the date of my death and if my 
Executor is unable or unwilling to serve in such jurisdiction, then I appoint the first successor 
Executor of my estate designated in Paragraph A of Article THIRD who is able and willing to 
serve in such jurisdiction. If no Executor or successor Executor is able and willing to serve in 
2657367.1 
GJ_000127

such jurisdiction, my Executor shall designate a successor Executor to serve in such jurisdiction. 
Such designation shall be made by written instrument delivered to such successor Executor. 
C. 
No bond or other security shall be required of any 
Executor in any jurisdiction. 
D. 
Any Executor may resign by filing a written notice

successor Executor shall be paid by my estate. 
E.

Executor shall 
not 
be accountable or 
responsible to any person interested in my estate for the manner in which my Executor in good

Executor shall not be liable for any loss or depreciation in value occasioned by reason of any 
negligence, error or mistake of judgment in entering into any transaction, in making any sale or 
investment, in continuing to hold any property or by reason of any action or omission, whether 
by my Executor or any other fiduciary, unless my Executor has acted in bad faith. In the absence 
of proof by affirmative evidence to the contrary, each Executor shall be deemed to have acted 
within the scope of my Executor's authority, to have exercised reasonable care, diligence and 
prudence and to have acted impartially as to all interested persons. An Executor shall not be 
liable for the acts or defaults of another Executor.

statutory or other rule of law. My Executor shall exercise my Executor's best judgment and 
discretion for what my Executor believes to be in the best interests of the beneficiaries 
hereunder. If more than two Executors are empowered to participate in the decision to exercise 
or not exercise any fiduciary power granted by this Will or by law, a majority of such Executors

• 
THIRD: 
A. 
I appoint DARREN K. INDYKE, JOSEPH PAGANO and JAMES E. .

appoint DAVID MITCHELL as successor Executor. I authorize the last acting Executor to designate his successor 
as Executor. 
B. 
If my estate must be administered in whole or in part in any 
• 
jurisdiction other than the state or territory of my domicile at the date of my death and if my Executor is unable or 
unwilling to serve in such jurisdiction, then 1 appoint the successor Executor of my estate designated in Paragraph

JEFFREY E. EPSTEIN 
I, JEFFREY E. EPSTEIN, of Little St. James Island, St. Thomas, United States Virgin Islands, being of

compensation to each Executor for serving as Executor hereunder, the sum of Two Hundred Fifty 
Thousand Dollars ($250,000) to each Executor upon the completion of probate of my estate. No 
Executor shall receive any other compensation for serving as Executor hereunder; provided, however,

liabilities incurred or paid in respect thereto, including fees and expenses of counsel or any other agents 
hired by my Executor, and my Executor shall not be liable therefor individually.

I give, bequeath and devise all of my property, real and personal, 
wherever situated, which I won at my death or of which I have the power to dispose after the payments 
and distributions provided in Article FIRST, to the then acting Trustees of The Jeffrey E. Epstein 2014 
Trust (the "Trust") created under that certain Trust Agreement (the "Trust Agreement") dated November 
2014, as the same may be amended from time to time, to be held in accordance with the provisions 
comprising the Trust Agreement at the time of my death. 
THIRD: 
A. 
I appoint DARREN K. INDYKE, DAVID MITCHELL and 
JAMES E. STALEY to be the Executors of this Will. If any one or more of my Executors fails to qualify 
or ceases to act, I appoint LAWRENCE H. SUMMERS as successor Executor. I authorize the last acting 
Executor to designate his successor as Executor. 
B. 
If my estate must be administered in whole or in part in 
any jurisdiction other than the state or territory of my domicile at the date of my death and if my 
Executor is unable or unwilling to serve in such jurisdiction, then I appoint the successor Executor of my 
estate designated in Paragraph A of Article THIRD provided that he is able and willing to serve in such 
jurisdiction. If no Executor or successor Executor is able and willing to serve in such jurisdiction, my 
Executor shall designate a successor Executor to serve in such jurisdiction. Such designation shall be

(3) 
to 
pay 
any 
property distributable to a 
beneficiary under a legal disability, without liability to my Executor, by paying such property (a) to such 
beneficiary, (b) for the use of such beneficiary, (c) to a legal representative of such beneficiary appointed

(7) 
to make, execute and deliver any and all such 
instruments in writing as shall be necessary or proper to carry out any power, right, duty or obligation of 
my Executor or any disposition whatsoever of my estate or any asset of my estate and to exercise any and 
all other powers incidental or necessary to carry out or to fulfill the terms, provisions and purposes of my 
estate. 
D. 
In connection with any insurance policy or annuity on 
the life of an Executor which is included in my estate, such Executor shall not participate in the decision 
to exercise or not exercise any fiduciary power in connection with any incidents of ownership for such 
policy or annuity, including, without limitation, any decision to continue, assign, terminate or convert 
such policy or annuity or to name the beneficiary of such policy or annuity. 
E. 
An Executor hereunder may by a written notice

exercise any fiduciary power granted by this Will or by law. 
F. 
If an Executor is not empowered (because of a conflict 
of interest, declination to act or otherwise) to participate in the decision to exercise or not exercise any 
fiduciary power granted by this Will or by law, then the remaining Executor or Executors shall be 
empowered to make such decision. If no Executor is empowered to participate in such decision, then the 
successor Executor of my estate designated in Paragraph A of Article THIRD and able and willing to act 
shall be empowered to make such decision. If no Executor or successor Executor is empowered to 
participate in such decision, my Executor may designate a successor Executor to serve as Executor of my 
estate who shall be empowered to make such decision but shall have no other power or authority of my 
Executor. Such designation shall be by written notice delivered to such successor Executor.

accounting principles in the judgment of my Executor. 
(2) 
Except as otherwise specifically provided in 
this Will, my Executor shall not treat any part of the principal amount of the proceeds of sale of any asset 
of my estate as income distributable to or for the benefit of any beneficiary entitled to distributions of 
income; provided, however, that my Executor shall treat a portion of any proceeds of sale of any 
financial instrument originally issued or acquired at a discount equal to the amount which (a) has 
previously been characterized as ordinary income for income tax purposes or (b) will be characterized as 
ordinary income for income tax purposes in the year of such sale, as income for trust accounting 
purposes. 
FIFTH: 
Where a party to any proceeding with respect to my estate has the same 
interest as a person under a disability, it shall not be necessary to serve legal process on the person under 
a disability. 
SIXTH: 
If any beneficiary under the Trust shall in any way directly or indirectly 
(a) contest or object to the probate of my Will or to the validity of any disposition or provision of my 
Will or of the Trust or (b) institute or prosecute, or be in any way directly or indirectly instrumental in 
the institution or prosecution of, any action, proceeding, contest, objection or claim for the purpose of 
setting aside or invalidating my Will or the Trust or any disposition herein or therein or provision hereof 
G.I_000164 
EFTA00016889
--- PAGE 7 ---
or thereof, then I direct that (a) any and all provisions in the Trust for such beneficiary and his issue in 
any degree shall be null and void and (b) my estate, whether passing under my Will or the Trust or 
pursuant to the laws of intestacy, shall be disposed of as if such beneficiary and his issue in any degree 
had all failed to survive me. 
SEVENTH: 
A. 
As used herein: 
(1) 
The term "Executor" of a person's estate means 
all persons or entities who occupy the office of executor, administrator, personal representative, or 
ancillary administrator while such persons or entities occupy such office, whether one or more persons or 
entities occupy such office at the same time or times, and includes any successor or successors to that 
office. The term "Trustee" means all persons or entities who occupy the office of Trustee under the Trust 
Agreement while such persons or entities occupy such office, whether one or more persons or entities 
occupy the office of Trustee at the same time or times, and includes any successor Trustee or Trustees. A 
reference to a person's estate or probate estate means that person's estate which is subject to probate 
administration. A reference to a person's Will means such person's Last Will and Testament and any 
Codicil or Codicils thereto. 
(2) 
The term "IRC section" means a section of the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the corresponding provision of any successor Internal 
Revenue law, as in effect as of the date of my death. 
(3) 
A reference to any tax also includes any interest 
or penalties thereon. A reference to a person's "Gross Estate" means such person's gross estate as finally 
determined for purposes of computing such person's federal estate tax. 
(4) 
Whenever the singular number is used, the 
same shall include the plural, and the masculine gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders. 
B. 
(1) 
The Federal and state transfer taxes which my 
Executor shall be obligated to pay pursuant to Paragraph C of Article FIRST shall consist of all Federal 
and state estate, inheritance, succession, and similar taxes (including any Federal or state generation-
skipping transfer tax) imposed upon my probate estate or by reason of my death in respect to all assets 
which pass under this Will or the Trust Agreement. Subject to Paragraph B(2) of this Article, all Federal 
estate taxes with respect to assets not passing under this Will or the Trust Agreement (such assets are 
referred to as the "Apportionment Assets") and any applicable state estate taxes with respect to the 
Apportionment Assets shall be apportioned among all persons interested in the Apportionment Assets. 
My Executor shall make reasonable efforts to collect all Federal estate taxes and state estate, inheritance, 
succession and similar taxes allocable to the Apportionment Assets from the recipients of the 
Apportionment Assets. Without changing the apportionment of taxes in this Paragraph B(I), my 
Executor has discretion, but is not required, to pay all or part of such taxes allocable to the 
Apportionment Assets. To the extent my Executor pays such taxes allocable to the Apportionment 
Assets, my Executor shall seek reimbursement for such taxes from the recipients of the Apportionment 
Assets. My Executor shall not be personally liable for any of such taxes if my Executor is unable, with 
reasonable efforts, to collect payment (or reimbursement) from any recipient of any Apportionment 
Assets for any or all of such taxes allocable to such assets. 
(2) 
My Executor has discretion to direct the Trustee 
of the Trust Agreement to pay all or any portion of the taxes which my Executor is directed or obligated 
to pay pursuant to Paragraph B of Article FIRST and this Paragraph B pursuant to a written direction 
delivered to the Trustee under the Trust Agreement. Any taxes which my Executor directs the Trustee 
G1_000165 
EFTA00016890
--- PAGE 8 ---
under the Trust Agreement to pay shall be allocated and paid from the trusts under the Trust Agreement 
as provided under the Trust Agreement. 
C. 
Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Will, a 
bequest or devise to an individual who does not survive me shall lapse notwithstanding any law to the 
contrary. 
D. 
To the extent that the distribution to the Trustee under 
the Trust Agreement pursuant to Article SECOND shall not be effective, I give all the rest of my 
property, real and personal, wherever situated, after the payments and distributions provided in Article 
FIRST, to the person or persons named as Trustee or Trustees under the Trust Agreement, be to held in 
trust under this Will in accordance with the provisions comprising the Trust Agreement at the time of my 
death, which provisions are incorporated in this Will by reference. 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have duly executed this Will the IQ) th day of November, 
2014.

Aida, 
To confirm, we are looking into whether video of the hallway, and videos and/or photos of the cell exist. We likely would 
make those available for review in the same manner as the report. We are also looking into whether the orange rope was 
preserved and if it was, we will let you know our position on whether it can be made available for inspection. As discussed 
briefly, since you have reviewed a photograph of the rope, we are not sure the basis for a physical inspection and would 
ask you to articulate one for our consideration.

Thank you for taking the time to let us review sensitive disclosure materials in your office on Friday. We appreciate it. I

1. It is our understanding that there is video surveillance in the hallway in or near the tier that was preserved in

2. 
It is our understanding that there may be photographs or a video recording of cell 124 that would have been

3. 
If the orange rope was preserved, we would like to view it in person. 
Jason, I understand that you were not aware of the availability of the above and that you would look into this additional 
discovery. I just wanted to memorialize our follow up inquiries for your records. 
Lastly, if the items above are available, does your office take a position with respect to our request to view them? We

Hello 
It was good to see you yesterday. Thank you for accommodating my visit with Tartaglione and giving him extra time to 
review his discovery. We very much appreciate that. 
I am writing to request the preservation of all video surveillance that captures the hallway outside of Tartaglione's cell on 
the date and time of the Epstein incident that is currently being investigated. I believe that the date and time is July 23 
during the early morning hours. Accordingly, I would ask that all video surveillance from July 22 at 11 pm to July 23 at 4 am 
is preserved. If it is your understanding that the incident occurred at a different time, please let me know and preserve the 
relevant footage, including an hour before the incident and an hour afterwards. If the responding officers were wearing 
body cameras that captured the inside of the cell in the aftermath of the incident, I am requesting that such footage also be 
preserved. 
We will be officially requesting this material through the appropriate means, but please consider this email a formal 
preservation request. 
Thank you.

with the Epstein case. Can we please get those materials uploaded to Relativity, for privilege review by

here)? I've left the hard drive with the materials on your chair. (And if we could please get that hard drive back once 
the materials are uploaded, the FBI has another batch they want to transmit to us for the same process, so that will

And then 
these will be subject to just the exact same privilege review you previously ran in connection with 
Epstein search warrant returns. 
Please let us know if any questions or issues at all? And thanks very much as always.

Wanted to quickly check the status of the below — it's only been a couple weeks, so totally understand it may not be 
complete, but hopefully we're getting close? If you could please check with the vendor and let us know, we'd be grateful 
— and we'll plan to get it to

We've received a hard drive from FBI CART, which they've processed from devices seized and searched in connection with 
the Epstein case. Can we please get those materials uploaded to Relativity, for privilege review by 
(copied here)? I've 
left the hard drive with the materials on your chair. (And if we could please get that hard drive back once the materials 
are uploaded, the FBI has another batch they want to transmit to us for the same process, so that will also be coming 
shortly.)

And then M, these will be subject to just the exact same privilege review you previously ran in connection with Epstein

Please let us know if any questions or issues at all? And thanks very much as always.

Chris and Mark just called me a few minutes ago, wanting to generally check in and see if we wanted or needed anything 
from them. I said that as a general matter, in terms of status, the investigation is ongoing, and that I didn't have any 
additional information beyond that. On whether we needed anything, I said I would circle up with the team and get them 
an answer on that. Initially my thought was to say no, nothing needed from them right now, but now I wonder, do we 
want to issue any document subpoenas to GM? Photos, communications, journals, memo pads, financial records 
associated with Epstein, or anything else ... thoughts??

Wanted to follow up on the latest round of document processing, referenced below from a few weeks ago, on the Epstein

Subject: RE: Epstein (records for Relativity upload) 
I've generally reviewed the PDF file creations and indices and overall I think they look good. A couple notes for the next 
round of materials — most importantly, for any phone bills or invoices, in the index they create, please have them list the 
phone number in the index along with the rest of the description of the file or document (so we can more easily search, 
rather than having to rely on the OCR versions in Relativity). And then second, if in the index they can create a tab that 
contains a column with just the document description (rather than the entire file extension, which it looks like they did for 
these ones). 
For this round, though, it looks good, and we'll have our paralegals make those changes for these docs. Accordingly, these 
records can be uploaded into Relativity under the general folder "Florida investigation FOIA files". (Due to the events of 
this weekend we no longer have active discovery obligations, but we will be reviewing the documents in connection with 
the ongoing investigation.) Your door was locked so I put the envelope with the flash drive right outside your office. 
The next round of materials is the set of discs we've been discussing over the past several days. Unfortunately for us, 
there's likely to be a lot of overlap in this round of materials and the previous documents, because in theory they all come 
from the same place, but we want to process all of them to make sure we're ultimately meeting any and all obligations. In 
terms of the vendor, this newer set of docs should be easier because they should be already broken up into component 
parts, but as discussed we'd like them to double-check that — and also to do the same type of index creation as in the last 
round. 
Please let us know if any other questions or issues, let me know if I'm forgetting anything, and thanks as always.

The vendor has finished creating the new PDF files based on the 66 PDF files you gave to me in June. I have the data on a 
flash drive and figured you would like to review the data before it is loaded to Relativity. Please let me know if you are in 
your office and I will bring you the flash drive.

Hi 
In connection with this trip, could you please assist with booking the following travel? Thanks! 
• 
Hotel—same as last time, the DoubleTree in Santa Monica is fine. Checking in 12/15, checking out the next day 
• 
We do not need a conference room 
• 
Outbound flight: Sunday, 12/15, departing JFK at 11:40 am on Delta, landing at LAX at 3:01 p.m. 
• 
Inbound flight: Monday, 12/16, departing LAX at 8:32 p.m. on JetBlue, landing at JFK at 4:47 a.m. 
• 
If you could please make all flights refundable, that would be great — it's possible we'll need to rebook parts of 
this if witness availability changes or we're able to stay longer and meet with an additional witness. 
Thanks a bunch.

I'm not sure who's the exact right person to ask this, so wanted to get everybody on one email chain about it — I have the 
hard drive tha 
dropped off that has new Epstein search warrant materials, but it looks like there are also old 
materials (that I think we had previously received and uploaded??) on the hard drive, and so I'm not sure what's new. 
Just generally, ant 
and I talked about this last week too, but it's basically impossible for us to keep track of what 
we're getting, and what has been completed, without some kind of identification or labeling system, along with a list of 
which devices have been extracted and downloaded. 
So for example on the hard drive currently, there are 38 folders labeled "loadFiles" through "37loadFiles" with a modified 
date of 11/14/19, which I think we may have already previously received — but I'm not sure, because we haven't gotten 
any info on which folders match up to which devices, etc. And then there's another folder titled "NYC024362" that has a 
modified date of 1/27/20, so I think that may be the materials we hadn't previously received? That folder by itself has 
more than 600,000 items. 
I don't want to givaManything that we've already previously received and uploaded, and I can't tell from the folder or 
file names whether eve 
hing on the drive is new, or whether just additional materials were saved onto it in addition to 
what we already have. 
are you able to give us some guidance on this? Ultimately what we really need is a 
spreadsheet of every device, whether it's been dumped (or partially dumped), and then identifying that same info —
which device, and what materials from it — are being given to us with each data transfer. Otherwise I think 
organizationally and for review purposes it will be a total disaster for us. 
We're happy to have a meeting on this if that's helpful — and thanks everybody for the assistance.

Re: 
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) 
Dear Counsel: 
Pursuant to Rule 16(a)(1)(G) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Government 
hereby 
ovides notice that it may call as an expert witness at trial 
a clinical 
The Government reserves the right to call additional expert witnesses and will promptly provide 
notice if the Government elects to do so. 
I. 
Disclosure by the Government 
EFTA00016950
--- PAGE 3 ---
Page 2 
is expected to testify, based on her relevant education, training, experience, 
and research to the following: Individuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by 
perpetrators of sexual abuse. Sexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of 
manipulation or coercion in the context of an established relationship that is developed over time, 
rather than through the use of forcible rape. Minor victims are often subject to a strategic pattern 
of behaviors, often called grooming, that can take a variety of forms and function to render the 
victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and to build trust and attachment 
with their abuser. The relationship of trust and attachment can prevent victims from being aware 
that what they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure. Minor victims therefore may 
not identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not recognize the 
consequences of that abuse until adulthood. Repeated exploitation and abuse can increase the 
likelihood of victimization later in life and can result in long-term traumatic and psychological 
consequences, especially when it occurs in the context of conStrauma. The presence of other 
• 
individuals can facilitate the sexual abuse of minors. •
is also expected to testify that 
nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for 
a variety of reasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted 
by a number of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma. M. 
has not 
evaluated
 specific victim in this case, and the Government does not presently intend to offer 
M. 
testimony regarding any specific victim. 
• 
expected testimony relies on her education and training on plycholo ical 
trauma, traumatic stress, interpersonal violence, and sexual abuse. It also relies on E. 
extensive clinical experience treatint individuals who suffered sexual abuse and trauma in 
childhood and adolescence, as well as E 
experience conducting forensic psychological 
evaluations of people who have experienced sexual abuse and trauma. The Government is 
producing notes from the Government's interviews with M. 
today as well. 
II. 
Request for Reciprocal Discovery and Expert Notice 
In light of your request for the foregoing notice, the Government hereby requests reciprocal 
notice under Rule 16(b)(1)(C) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure regarding any expert 
witness that the defendant intends to rely upon, including a written summary of any testimony that 
the defendant intends to use under Rules 702, 703, or 705 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, as 
well as the witness's qualifications. 
has previously testified in state court and has been deposed in the course of federal 
and state litigation. As a courtesy, a list of that testimony is also being produced to you today 
bearing Bates number 3502-002. 
EFTA00016951
--- PAGE 4 ---
Page 3 
Additionally, the Government reiterates its August 5, 2020 request for reciprocal discovery 
under Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(b). Specifically, we request that you allow inspection and copying of: 
(1) any books, papers, documents, data, photographs, tangible objects, buildings or places, or 
copies or portions thereof, which are in the defendant's possession, custody or control, and which 
the defendant intends to introduce as evidence or otherwise rely on at trial; and (2) any results or 
reports of physical or mental examinations and of scientific tests or experiments made in 
connection with this case, or copies thereof, which are in the defendant's possession or control, 
and which the defendant intends to introduce as evidence or otherwise rely on at trial or which 
were prepared by a witness whom the defendant intends to call at trial. 
The Government also reiterates its August 5, 2020 request that the defendant disclose prior 
statements of witnesses she will call to testify, including expert witnesses. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 
26.2; United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225 (1975). The Government requests that such material 
be provided on the same basis upon which the Government agrees to supply the defendant with 
3500 material relating to Government witnesses.

Hello all, 
I am a journalist with the Press Association in London. 
Is there anyone who might be able to outline whether the trial of US v Ghislaine Maxwell is due to open, as planned, on 
November 29 please? 
Also looking to try and find out whether the defendant is due to give evidence, and how long the trial is listed for. 
Have had no joy getting hold of anyone at the court (212 637 2600). 
Apologies — I am sure you have had several of these requests. Please let me know if there is a better person to contact.

Subject: Call from SONY 
Just received a call from the Crim Chief in SONY. SDNY has an open criminal matter involving Jeff 
Epstein. They understand we are recused and have shared nothing about the matter. The 
purpose of the call concerned their efforts to obtain from the FBI in the SDFL the evidence 
gathered as part of the SDFL Epstein investigation. The Miami FBI has expressed a reluctance to 
send any 6e materials to the SDNY FBI without a 6e letter. Given our recusal from the 
underlying criminal matter, I don't believe we should be the ones to give the FBI the go-ahead 
or the 6e letter. We no longer control that evidence. 
Do you have the name and contact information for the new USAO/AUSA handling our old 
criminal case? I think the best bet is to put SDNY in touch with that AUSA. 
Thanks

Date: Thu, 16 Jan 2020 16:43:10 +0000 
In case we don't have enough to do on the 22nd, I intend to raise several issues about the jail. In no particular 
order; 
1. They are refusing to allow us to view the cells and common areas where Nick has been held for nearly 3 years. 
Initially, we were told we would be permitted and that photographs would be taken and reviewed by the staff. We 
are going to file a motion to compel before the 22nd. 
2. I have written multiple emails to 
asking for an opportunity to view the physical evidence for the July 
23rd suicide attempt. She has thus not responded at all 
3. We wrote complaining about multiple reports of extreme heat on the tier. One or two inmates had to be 
hospitalized. We have not been given an update. 
4. We asked for a family visit after next week's court appearance and gave the same reasons we have been 
giving. This time we were asked for more detail. I sense a change in the mcc approach. My inclination is to ask 
the judge to help here. 
I was hoping the new administration would improve the conditions while maintaining 
responsiveness.

As we flagged for you a week ago, and as expected, we had a meeting with the office leadership today to 
discuss the status of the case in general and Ms. 
in particular. We continue to believe that it would be 
helpful to receive any clarifications, as well as any response to the complaint originally sent on December 4, as 
soon as possible; we are available tomorrow or over the weekend if there is a time that works for you. If it 
remains impossible to talk before Tuesday, we have 2:30 in our calendar for then, but with a hard stop at 3:30 
so please let us know if you'd like to start the discussion earlier if you expect it might be useful to have 
additional time. 
More generally, you had requested the opportunity to present to the ultimate decision-makers in the case if it 
appeared that charges were likely, and based on our meeting today, the Office would like to provide you that 
opportunity. If you could please let us know what dates and times you are available in the ranges of January 
15-17 and 21-22, we will figure out a time when all the relevant supervisors here are available. I expect that 
meeting will include at least the U.S. Attorney, the Deputy U.S. Attorney 
ad the Chief of the 
Criminal Division a, 
and some combination of the Chief Counsel 
, the Counsel 
the two Public Corruption Unit chiefs (
IIME). the line assistants, and/or 
FBI investigative and supervisory personnel. We will be prepared to discuss that meeting with you via phone 
when we speak as well, which is one reason I note that we can begin our discussion earlier than 2:30 on 
Tuesday (or block off significant time to talk before then) if that would be useful.

Thanks very much for being in touch. We had actually planned to be in touch today—we expect that next week 
we'll be having meaningful conversations internally with supervisors about the possible / likely paths forward 
for aspects of the case including Ms. 
. In connection with that expectation, we wanted to ask if you 
were prepared and willing) to convey to convey your client's recollection regarding the incident described in 
the complaint 
sent on December 4 (re-attaching here, specifically at page seven). To the extent you 
have additional information that would be helpful to convey, even minor, we would be available anytime in the 
coming days to do a call. If that isn't possible until you come back, obviously we understand the challenges of

22nd), and I know the brass feels that the issues are teed up and they want to provide an opportunity to hear from 
you as soon as possible. Are you available on any of those days, of it not, some other time next week? 
thanks,

As we flagged for you a week ago, and as ex
 we had a meeting with the office leadership today to discuss 
the status of the case in general and Ms. 
in particular. We continue to believe that it would be helpful to 
receive any clarifications, as well as any response to the complaint originally sent on December 4, as soon as 
possible; we are available tomorrow or over the weekend if there is a time that works for you. If it remains 
impossible to talk before Tuesday, we have 2:30 in our calendar for then, but with a hard stop at 3:30 so please 
let us know if you'd like to start the discussion earlier if you expect it might be useful to have additional time. 
More generally, you had requested the opportunity to present to the ultimate decision-makers in the case if it 
appeared that charges were likely, and based on our meeting today, the Office would like to provide you that 
opportunity. If you could please let us know what dates and times you are available in the ranges of January 15-
and 21-22, we will figure out a time when all the relevant supervisors here are available. I expect that meeting 
will include at least the U.S. Attorney, the Deputy U.S. Attorney 
and the Chief of the Criminal 
Division 
and some combination of the Chief Counsel 
, the Counsel 
the two Public Corruption Unit chiefs 
), the line assistants, and/or FBI 
investigative and supervisory personnel. We will be prepared to discuss that meeting with you via phone when 
we speak as well, which is one reason I note that we can begin our discussion earlier than 2:30 on Tuesday (or 
block off significant time to talk before then) if that would be useful. 
thank you,

Sony for the delay in my response. Unfortunately, I won't be able to address this until my return to the office. 
Apologies. Of course, I will consult witaand 
try to get back to you as quickly as possible following my 
return. In anticipation of being able to do that, do you want to "pencil in" a call for Tuesday, January 14 at 2:30?

Bruce, 
Thanks for raising these issues with us in advance of the conference. We appreciate the o ortunit to t 
and 
address them with MCC in advance. Below are responses based on our conversation wi 
and 
we have copied all counsel because until Judge Karas instructs us otherwise, we intend to communicate with all 
counsel of record. 
— 
has advised us that allowing a tour of this kind is a security risk for the institution because, among 
other things, you have asked to tour areas where many inmates will be, and the institution cannot be locked down 
for purposes of an outside person taking a tour absent a very specific and pressing reason. 
also advised 
that were the Court to order such a tour, MCC would set very specific conditions and ask that the Government 
also be present. 
— 
has advised that she is working with SIS to get a date and time for the inspection of physical 
evidence, and hopefully will be reaching out today to schedule the inspection. 
— 
has advised that upon receiving your email, she had her staff speak with 
about the 
heat. The staff took heat reports in the unit and found the temperature was high. The staff made adjustments and 
there have not been complaints since. We have asked for another temperature reading to be taken in the unit 
before Wednesday's conference to ensure the temperature is at an acceptable level. 
— 
has advised that she asked you for additional information that she can discuss with the Warden in 
order to assess the request for a family visit, but has not heard back from you. As previously discussed, in order 
for the MCC to make an exception for your client, a social visit must be necessary for preparation of the defense. 
The Government is not trying to, nor does it want to be, in the middle of that assessment, but we understand 
from the MCC that your most recent request was conclusory and they need more detail to make an assessment of 
this new request.

I. They are refusing to allow us to view the cells and common areas where Nick has been held for nearly 3 years. 
Initially, we were told we would be permitted and that photographs would be taken and reviewed by the staff. We 
are going to file a motion to compel before the 22nd. 
2. I have written multiple emails to 
asking for an opportunity to view the physical evidence for the July 
23rd suicide attempt. She has thus not responded at all 
3. We wrote complaining about multiple reports of extreme heat on the tier. One or two inmates had to be 
hospitalized. We have not been given an update. 
4. We asked for a family visit after next week's court appearance and gave the same reasons we have been 
giving. This time we were asked for more detail. I sense a change in the mcc approach. My inclination is to ask 
the judge to help here. 
I was hoping the new administration would improve the conditions while maintaining 
responsiveness.

Okay understood, thanks. Let's see what it looks like and then we can go from there. I assume we prefer to just get the 
raw data, rather than having the FBI process it poorly again, it's just a really unfortunate delay — so if farming it out would 
ultimately be more efficient, especially with everybody working remotely these days, we are very happy to push for that. 
Thanks again.

Right now we have a vendor to process the data as that is how we got the data uploaded to Relativity. I do not know the 
data size of anything yet so I did not want to talk to Ed yet about the amount of data that needs to be processed until I got 
something from the FBI.

should we be asking for permission to retain an outside vendor to deal with this? I just absolutely can't believe that 
eight months after the search, the FBI is going to dump terabytes of raw data on us to process, which I assume will take 
some process of months to process and upload. Would it be more efficient to have someone like Kroll or BRG do this in 
the first instance? I don't think we would have a problem getting the funding for it, if that would be at all helpful.

Okay, so just to check, you both think that there is not a need to do a test run? You're both comfortable with just basically 
sending us copies of everything? I don't totally understand why we couldn't have done that eight months ago, but 
regardless of the passage of time, I want to make sure we understand so we can report to our supervisors. I assume that 
means that we (at the U.S. Attorney's Office and through contractors) will therefore need to do all the processing 
ourselves, correct? And thanks again to you both.

In terms of data transfer, 
are you just sending a literal copy of all the raw data, and we'll process and upload it on 
our end? I ask to make sure we don't lose any searchability — when FBI sent versions before, it had already been 
processed. I think what we talked about on the phone a month ago was getting, for example, data from one device to 
make sure it transfers correctly, before sending over literally everything — is that still the plan?

On the returns themselves, do the changes you mentioned mean that the estimate of a month from now for complete

month (during our conference call a month ago) — so wanted to check if we can still expect that very soon? We're waiting 
on that list to be able to do an updated search warrant on all of those devices. Please let us know the current timeline —
and also the current timeline on producing the results from those August and September searches? I think you and =I 
were going to coordinate on that, and you had mentioned you expected we'd have it a couple months from our call, which 
would be about a month from now. Wanted to make sure we're still on track. 
thanks,

Yes, I can do anytime tomorrow, and 
can also join anytime tomorrow. So whenever is good on your end. 
Also, we can host a conference call, but only up to six lines at a time — so if FBI has larger capacity than that let us know, 
otherwise I'd propose we do:

Unfortunately I don't think this is very helpful to us. Did you take a look at the example spreadsheet I sent on 2/24? The 
excel file you sent has descriptions that don't match up to the items listed in the search warrant returns (that we sent on 
2/23), and we don't have the 1B or CART numbers to be able to cross-reference. We also can't tell what you mean by 
"loose media" without a specific comparison to what was seized, we don't know which items you're referring to as 
"Windows machines," and we can't tell whether the entirety of any particular item has been transferred, or just partial. 
For example, it looks like we have gotten very, very few image files, which is surprising. 
We have also encountered some very significant problems in trying to review the more than 1 million documents we 
recently received: 
The data we've received has no way to put any emails and attachments together. So if an email says, "see the 
attached flight records," for example, we have no way of linking that up with the records themselves. Not only is 
that a big problem for us in review, it's going to be a huge problem for producing the documents to defense 
counsel. 
The load file has no link to the native file, so when we load the data to the database, there's no way to have the 
native files show up in the database. Because many of the files are too large to open in the viewer, it effectively 
means that there are many files that are completely invisible to us. 
Related, the control numbers in the load file don't match up to the native files. So we have two sets of numbers 
and no way to match up anything—that is, even if we were to try to go hunt down every individual large file in the 
native files, it would be impossible. 
So the data that we most recently got, we need to get in a form that addresses those issues, and we likely will need to get 
a similar reproduction of the data we received a couple months ago. Otherwise we're sifting through more than a million 
documents without much rhyme or reason. 
I've re-attached the spreadsheet we sent last week — I think that's a good place to start in terms of our necessary record-
keeping, and we need that info at the very least, as well as anything else you think would be useful. Also attaching the SW 
returns for reference. And again, we're happy to meet up anytime and hash all this out in person if that's useful.

Here is a listing of what I have already handed over in load files to the US Attorney's Office for taint review. Some points of 
clarification: There were 9 IDE hard drives found in the Manhattan apartment, they turned out to be 3 copies of 3 drives 
(9 drives in total) from a July 2007 search on one of his properties. I only processed 3 (as they were all copies). All the 
loose media from the NY apartment is included. All the Windows machines from the NY apartment are included. Only 2 
Macs from NY and 1 from the Island are included.

I will have to more closely coordinate with whoever is loading up Relativity with the remaining Macs as the tool

Totally understand about the network issues—we can relate. I do still think it will be helpful to all sit down together to 
have an in-person discussion, to make sure everybody is on the same page. Are folks available for that next week? And 
what I think would be most helpful to facilitate that would be a spreadsheet of each separate device referenced in the two 
search warrant returns, with columns for whether we've dumped the contents, whether they've been reviewed and/or 
transferred, what portions were transferred, etc. 
Something roughly like the attached, with any other categories you think would be useful — and the info on the attached is 
mostly hypothetical, obviously, just as examples. That will help us fully understand what's been reviewed, transferred, 
and received so far, and what remains. 
(Also just on the pictures, we do want copies of those as well, please including from the discs and the devices — I think FBI 
was going to do an initial screen to make sure no CP, and since I think the answer was no, we'll need to get those to be 
able to review them as well.)

Sony for the delayed response. They are tearing out our old network and giving us a new one, they mandated we 
delete old stuff (about 400 TB worth). Now that they are working on replacing the network, we can do only local 
work. I should be able to give you an accounting of what is what. I can say, off the top of my head, that all 
windows based items from the NY search have been handed over as well as all loose media. The CDs from NY 
only contained pictures, no documents. There are still some Apple items from NY that need to be produced. As 
far as the Island stuff goes, the 1st item on your spreadsheet, the "kitchen" mac has been produced. Still working 
on the rest.

Following up on the below from last weekend, I'm still not sure how we're addressing this so I thought it would make

which files had previously been provided, but our tech folks did their best to differentiate, and we got access to the 
materials yesterday and its well over a million documents, and we don't have any idea what we're looking at — i.e., which 
devices the materials came from, whether it's full or partial results, how many more devices we have coming, etc. 
EFTA00017035

Based on the attached search warrant returns, it looks like from the New York mansion (the PDF) there are approximately 
devices that would have storage (computers, hard drives, thumb drives, etc.) and that's not even counting at least 60+ 
CDs. And then from the Virgin Islands (the Excel spreadsheet), at least more than 25 devices, including multiple servers / 
server racks. 
So we gotta know what we've already received, what remains, anticipated schedule, etc, and I know it's a lot of moving 
pieces on all sides so wanted to loop in everybody at once. The case team will be in California this coming week from 
Tuesday through Friday, but then I think generally around the first week of March, which will hopefully be plenty of time 
to schedule a productive meeting.

I'm not sure who's the exact right person to ask this, so wanted to get everybody on one email chain about it — I have the 
hard drive that 
dropped off that has new Epstein search warrant materials, but it looks like there are also old 
materials (that I think we had previously received and uploaded??) on the hard drive, and so I'm not sure what's new. 
Just generally, and 
and I talked about this last week too, but it's basically impossible for us to keep track of what 
we're getting, and what has been completed, without some kind of identification or labeling system, along with a list of 
which devices have been extracted and downloaded. 
So for example on the hard drive currently, there are 38 folders labeled "IoadFiles" through "37loadFiles" with a modified 
date of 11/14/19, which I think we may have already previously received — but I'm not sure, because we haven't gotten 
any info on which folders match up to which devices, etc. And then there's another folder titled "NYC024362" that has a 
modified date of 1/27/20, so I think that may be the materials we hadn't previously received? That folder by itself has 
more than 600,000 items. 
I don't want to give 
anything that we've already previously received and uploaded, and I can't tell from the folder or 
file names whether everything on the drive is new, or whether just additional materials were saved onto it in addition to 
what we already have. =, 
are you able to give us some guidance on this? Ultimately what we really need is a 
spreadsheet of every device, whether it's been dumped (or partially dumped), and then identifying that same info —
which device, and what materials from it — are being given to us with each data transfer. Otherwise I think 
organizationally and for review purposes it will be a total disaster for us. 
We're happy to have a meeting on this if that's helpful — and thanks everybody for the assistance.

You are aware of our position, and we do not believe any further rehashing of our prior conversations is productive at this 
point. That said, we can confirm that it is our standard practice to refrain from publicly commenting on the substance of any 
witness interview, and we intend to abide by that practice in this case. Beyond that, we can make no commitments. Please

On 10 January 2020 you personally assured me that any contact between the Duke of York and the DOJ was 
confidential and would remain confidential within the investigation team in the DOJ and FBI. You said: "We don't 
intend to share either the contents or the existence of the conversation beyond our chain of command in the DW. As 
well as our partners at the FBI. It is confidential within the investigation team and our supervisors." The note I made 
of what you said about the confidentiality of the interview process is as follows: "We do not publicise the content or 
existence of any of our interviews. We can't guarantee that anyone might not share it with some other person or it 
might be shared with other individuals who might come to have knowledge of its existence, but our office does not 
advise the press of the interview and doesn't advise other interviewees of the fact the interview has taken place or 
the contents of those discussions. For example, it was reported widely that our office was attempting to interview 
your client months ago which was inaccurate. We have been working on this request for several weeks now and it 
has not hit the press. That is consistent with our processes. We take confidentiality very seriously." 
At no point did you suggest that, because of a press statement made on behalf of the Duke in November 2019, you 
or your colleagues in the investigation team would feel able to provide a public commentary on the DOJ's views on 
EFTA00017042
--- PAGE 2 ---
the degree of cooperation provided by the Duke. DOJ's first contact of any kind with the Duke was in early January 
2020, and the first mention of any request for consideration of an interview came solely from you. 
I object to your wholly inaccurate statement that the Duke has created a public misimpression. The Duke has made it 
clear that he has a strong desire to cooperate fully with the ongoing investigation by the Dal. The communications 
between us were intended to enable him to provide that co-operation. In order for this process to continue, I need 
to emphasise that we regard the confidential treatment of all contacts between the Dal and the Duke as essential. 
We do not wish to have any public pronouncements on what we regard as a voluntary and confidential process. 
Please confirm that any further communications in connection with the requested voluntary interview will be 
treated as wholly confidential and the DOJ will offer no further commentary on the Duke's co-operation.

On November 20, 2019, Prince Andrew publicly offered to cooperate with our investigation into Jeffrey Epstein's crimes, 
stating in a press release: "Of course, I am willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their 
investigations, if required." In early January 2020, our Office responded to the Prince's public offer by contacting you to set 
up the interview that the Prince claimed to be willing give us. More than three weeks after our initial contact with you, we 
still had no date for an interview, nor did we even have a commitment from you that the Prince in fact would agree to an 
interview. 
On January 27, 2020, at a press event held by Safe Horizon to which Mr. Berman was invited, Mr. Berman was asked: "As 
part of [the Epstein] investigation have you reached out to interview Prince Andrew, and has he been cooperative?" 
EFTA00017043
--- PAGE 3 ---
Mr. Berman responded: "Ordinarily, our office doesn't comment on whether an individual cooperates or doesn't cooperate 
with our investigation. However, in Prince Andrew's case, he publicly offered, indeed in a press release, offered to 
cooperate with law enforcement investigating the crimes committed by Jeffrey Epstein and his coconspirators. So I think in 
that context, it's fair for people to know whether Prince Andrew has followed through with that public commitment. So let 
me say that the Southern District of New York and the FBI have contacted Prince Andrew's attorneys and requested to 
interview Prince Andrew and to date, Prince Andrew has provided zero cooperation." 
Mr. Berman's statement corrected a public misimpression — created by the Prince himself — that the Prince is cooperating 
with our investigation. 
As soon as the Prince commits to a date for the interview that he so publicly offered to us more than two months ago, we 
would be prepared to announce that he has agreed to be interviewed.

Thank you for your email response claiming that US Attorney Berman's statements were factually accurate and 
did not create a misleading impression. 
We only have access to edited video and newspaper reporting of what the US Attorney said. Those reports 
suggest the US Attorney described the position of the Duke of York and his advisors in misleading, condemnatory 
and prejudicial terms. US Attorney Berman is quoted as having stated there has been "zero co-operation". This is 
not an accurate statement of the position. The following are also false statements ascribed to Mr Berman and to 
the DOJ/FBI: "F.B.I. agents and federal prosecutors in New York ... reached out to his lawyers and asked to 
interview him. There was no response at all, according to three people familiar with the investigation." (New York 
Times 27.01.20) and "Geoffrey Berman, a US attorney, said federal prosecutors and the FBI had asked to 
interview Prince Andrew about the late paedophile billionaire, but had been met with a wall of silence"(The 
Telegraph 28.01.20). 
Please provide us with an accurate record of the statements made by The US Attorney and/or the DOJ/FBI 
including a transcript of any relevant questions and answers. 
We note from your email that you have not provided any response to our request that you confirm that the DOJ 
will not be making any further public statements about the Duke of York. We had understood from our 
conversations with you and from the rules governing media relations that DOJ personnel and the US Attorney 
would not comment on the nature or progress of any grand jury investigation and in particular would not 
comment on the willingness of any Subject to make a voluntary statement to the DOJ. We ask you to confirm 
that there will be no further public comment on any contact between the Duke of York and the Dal.

a real-time conversation once we have achieved some of the more immediate preliminary tasks, including the need to 
gather information from the Royal Household and others.

Gary, 
Thank you for your response. It would be useful for us if you were able to help us understand the nature of the issues 
and procedures with which you are dealing, particularly as it sounds like it will take at least a couple additional weeks 
to address even minor preliminary issues, which suggests likely additional subsequent time to handle further 
processes—and without a response to the question of whether he is willing to speak with us, separate from a general 
desire to cooperate. Our investigation is moving forward expeditiously and so we would be grateful for some 
understanding of the relevant issues (especially, though not exclusively, to the extent we may be able to assist in their 
resolution) and would be happy to speak via phone if a real-time conversation would be more conducive to that 
discussion. 
thank you,

Thank you for your email. The Duke of York has made it clear to us that he has a strong desire to cooperate fully with 
the ongoing investigation by the DOJ. 
It is our responsibility to deal with the various issues and procedures that arise here that will need to be addressed to 
enable him to do so. We should be able to deal with at least some of the minor preliminary issues in the next two 
weeks and we will update you on our progress once we have done so.

Mr. Bloxsome, 
Thank you for your response and for confirming your representation. To respond to your question generally, in 
connection with our investigation of conduct relating to Jeffrey Epstein and certain of his associates, we wish to 
request a consensual, voluntary law enforcement interview with your client. Generally, we would expect to 
inquire about his relationship and communications with Jeffrey Epstein and his associates, as well as certain 
allegations that have arisen publicly and in our investigation to date. 
Although we recognize we separately have the ability to convey such a request through diplomatic and law 
enforcement channels, we understand we may also alternatively inquire directly with counsel, when an 
individual has legal representation. Given your representation, we are inquiring directly with counsel in the first 
instance. 
Certainly we can discuss our request in more detail, but we hope this will provide the information you were 
seeking as a threshold matter, and we look forward to being in touch. 
Regards, 
Assistant U.S. Attorney 
Southern District of New York

Yeah, that's what all this week's fighting with Boies has been about. The Circuit has now given them until the 
20th to brief it, I think, so we can ask Boies about this in advance, but the documents have victim names 
redacted, for example --
https://apps.npr.org/documents/document.html?id=7011492a)eposition-May-2016 
That redacts 
name, for example. 
Though it wouldn't be new information that 
was approached by Epstein and Maxwell and interacted with 
them, given 
comments to the press previously.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
VIRGINIA L. GIUFFRE, 
Plaintiff, 
-against-
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 
Defendant. 
No. 15 Civ. 7433 (LAP) 
MEMORANDUM & ORDER 
LORETTA A. PRESKA, Senior United States District Judge: 
The Court has reviewed Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell's letter 
requesting reconsideration of the Court's July 23, 2020, decision 
to unseal (1) the transcripts of Ms. Maxwell's and Doe l's 
depositions, and (2) court submissions excerpting from, quoting 
from, or summarizing the contents of the transcripts. (See dkt. 
no. 1078.) 
Ms. Maxwell's eleventh-hour request for reconsideration is 
denied. As Ms. Maxwell acknowledges in her letter, reconsideration 
is an "extraordinary remedy." In re Beacon Assocs. Litig., 818 F. 
Supp. 2d 697, 701 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (quoting In re Health Mgmt. Sys. 
Inc. Sec. Litig., 113 F. Supp. 2d 613, 614 (S.D.N.Y. 2000)). Such 
motions "are properly granted only if there is a showing of: (1) 
an intervening change in controlling law; (2) the availability of 
new evidence; or (3) a need to correct a clear error or prevent 
manifest injustice." Drapkin v. Mafco Consol. Grp., Inc., 818 F. 
Supp. 2d 678, 696 (S.D.N.Y. 2011). "A motion for reconsideration 
EFTA00017070
--- PAGE 2 ---
CaCele1B963431734120tArneadditietterinOMOneef ;WI 2612,CRINbgeo2 tf 4 
may not be used to advance new facts, issues or arguments not 
previously presented to the Court, nor may it be used as a vehicle 
for relitigating issues already decided by the Court." Bennett v. 
Watson Wyatt & Co., 156 F. Supp.2d 270, 271 (S.D.N.Y. 2001). 
Here, Ms. Maxwell's request for reconsideration hinges on her 
assertion that new developments, i.e., her indictment and arrest, 
provide compelling reasons for keeping the deposition transcripts 
sealed. 
(See dkt. no. 1078 at 5.) 
But, despite Ms. Maxwell's 
contention that she could not address the effect of those events 
in her objections because they occurred after the close of 
briefing, (id.), 1 this is plowed ground. Indeed, in her original 
objection to unsealing, Ms. Maxwell argued that the specter of 
ongoing 
criminal 
investigations 
into 
unknown 
individuals 
associated with Jeffrey Epstein--a group that, of course, includes 
Ms. Maxwell--loomed large over the Court-ordered unsealing 
The Court notes as a practical matter that Ms. Maxwell was 
arrested on July 2, 2020--that is, three weeks prior to the Court's 
July 23 decision to unseal the materials at issue. To the extent 
that they relate to the to the Court's balancing of interests in 
the unsealing process, the issues that Ms. Maxwell raises in her 
request were surely plain the day that Ms. Maxwell was apprehended. 
Ms. Maxwell, however, did not seek to supplement her objections to 
unsealing despite ample time to do so. In fact, the Court notified 
the parties on July 21, 2020, that it would announce the unsealing 
decision with respect to Ms. Maxwell's deposition, together with 
other documents, on July 23. (See dkt. no. 1076.) Even then, Ms. 
Maxwell made no request for delay or to supplement her papers. 
Ms. Maxwell did not raise her "vastly different position," 
(Transcript of July 23 Ruling at 16:2-3), until moments after the 
Court had made its decision to unseal the relevant documents. 
EFTA00017071
--- PAGE 3 ---
CaCele1806341734120LNA e addittitie ria00C2 Med 'Of 2/912CRIZjageat tf 4 
process. (See dkt. no. 1057 at 5.) This argument, specifically 
Ms. Maxwell's concern that unsealing would "inappropriately 
influence potential witnesses or alleged victims," (id.), and her 
reference 
to "publicly 
reported 
statements 
by 
Plaintiff, 
Plaintiff's counsel, the United States Attorney for the Southern 
District of New York, and the Attorney General for the U.S. Virgin 
Islands" about those investigations, (id.), carried with it the 
clear implication that Ms. Maxwell could find herself subject to 
investigation and, eventually, indictment. The Court understood 
that implication as applying to Ms. Maxwell and thus has already 
considered any role that criminal charges against Ms. Maxwell might 
play in rebutting the presumption of public access to the sealed 
materials. 
Ms. Maxwell's request for reconsideration of the 
Court's July 23 ruling is accordingly denied. 
Given the Court's denial of Ms. Maxwell's request for 
reconsideration, the Court will stay the unsealing of Ms. Maxwell's 
and Doe l's deposition transcripts and any sealed or redacted order 
or paper that quotes from or discloses information from those 
deposition transcripts for two business days, i.e., through 
Friday, July 31, 2020, so that Ms. Maxwell may seek relief from 
the Court of Appeals. Any sealed materials that do not quote from 
or disclose information from those deposition transcripts shall be 
unsealed on July 30, 2020, in the manner described by the Court's 
Order dated July 28, 2020. (See dkt. no. 1077.) Ms. Maxwell's and

Pursuant to this Court's Order and protocol for Unsealing Decided Motions, Intervenors 
Julie Brown and Miami Herald Media Co. ("Miami Herald") respectfully submit this response to 
Ms. Maxwell's Memorandum Brief in Support of Her Objections to Unsealing Sealed Materials 
(Dkt. 1057) ("the Objections")} 
ARGUMENT 
Ms. Maxwell's objections to the unsealing of Dkt. Entries 143, 164, 172, 199, and 230 (and 
related submissions) are entirely without merit, and these documents should be unsealed in their 
entirety. The objections mischaracterize the governing law, including the Second Circuit's ruling 
in Brown v. Maxwell, 929 F.3d 41 (2d. Cir. 2019); rely upon general "alleged countervailing 
interests" against disclosure that are not supported by the extensive body of case law addressing 
whether a judicial document may be sealed by the Court; and assert unsubstantiated, generalized, 
and speculative harms based on the alleged countervailing interests that are insufficient to 
outweigh the presumption of access to these judicial documents. 
As set forth in detail below, there is no basis identified in the Objections for the Court to 
continue sealing Dkt. Entries 143, 164, 172, 199, and 230 (and related docket entries identified by 
Ms. Maxwell). 
I. 
Ms. Maxwell Mischaracterizes Brown v. Maxwell. 
Ms. Maxwell's filing selectively quotes from the Second Circuit's ruling in Brown v. 
Maxwell in an attempt to minimize the right of access that attaches to all judicial documents. 
Maxwell's repeated assertion that these documents are entitled to "a minimal presumption of 
access" is directly contradicted by the Second Circuit's conclusion that "the presumption of access 
to "materials submitted in connection with, and relevant to, discovery motions, motions in limine, 
' Counsel for Intervenors has not seen these documents and submits this response based on the list 
of Decided Motions prepared by counsel for the Parties and Ms. Maxwell's Objections. 
EFTA00017075
--- PAGE 3 ---
casgemgW6143§tiumeneekt-OrgefifilVo4fheifigf23028v4ef31th 10 
and other non-dispositive motions" is "substantial." Brown v. Maxwell, 929 F.3d at 53 (2d. Cir. 
2019). 
It is also well-established that the party requesting that documents remain sealed bears the 
heavy burden of demonstrating that there are compelling competing factors that outweigh the 
presumption of access that attaches to each of the judicial documents at issue here. See Delta Air 
Lines, Inc. v. Bombardier, Inc., No. 1:20-CV-3025-GHW, 2020 WL 2614704, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. 
May 22, 2020); Bernsten v. O'Reilly, 307 F. Supp. 3d 161, 168 (S.D.N.Y. 2018); Lytle v. 
JPMorgan Chase, 810 F. Supp. 2d 616, 621-22 (S.D.N.Y. 2011). Those factors and the harm of 
disclosure must be identified with specificity. Lytle, 810 F. Supp. 2d at 621-22. None of Ms. 
Maxwell's Objections meets this heavy burden. 
II. 
Ms. Maxwell's General Objections Are Without Merit. 
Ms. Maxwell asserts objections based on alleged "countervailing interests" that are not 
recognized in the extensive body of case law addressing whether a judicial document may be 
sealed by the Court. 
A. 
Reliance on a Protective Order By a Party or Non-Party 
Ms. Maxwell argues that, if a party or non-party relies on a protective order or sealing order 
and provides information in discovery, the information must remain sealed. This is incorrect. 
First, courts in this Circuit have routinely ordered unsealing of documents in cases with 
protective orders or confidentiality provisions. See, e.g., Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d 
133, 143 (2d Cir. 2004) (unsealing judicial document despite party's claim that it had settled claim 
to "avoid public disclosure at trial of the temporarily sealed documents"); Bernsten v. O'Reilly, 
307 F. Supp. 3d 161 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (unsealing documents submitted in support of motion to 
compel arbitration despite parties' agreement to file them under seal); Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. 
Wales LLC, 993 F.Supp.2d 409, 414 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (holding the fact that the agreement 
EFTA00017076
--- PAGE 4 ---
casgamgfic26143 Piton enbigniefiFili00446g2teagcsthefat 10 
"contains a confidentiality clause is not binding here, given the public's right of access to `judicial 
documents'").2 Courts do so, recognizing that "[t]he presumption of public access would become 
virtually meaningless if it could be overcome by the mutual interest of the parties..." Wolinsky v. 
Scholastic Inc., 900 F.Supp.2d 332, 334 (S.D.N.Y. 2012). 
And second, here, the plain terms of the Protective Order do not support Maxwell's reliance 
argument. The Protective Order at issue specifically provided that it would "have no force and 
effect on the use of any CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION at trial." Dkt. 39-1, at 6. Therefore, 
the Protective Order contemplated certain information becoming public at trial, and any party's 
reliance on the Protective Order to prevent all sensitive information from becoming public is 
unfounded. 
B. 
Prevention of the Abuse of Court Records and Files 
Ms. Maxwell again mischaracterizes Brown v. Maxwell in stating that the Court should use 
sealing orders to prevent abuse of court records and files. In Brown v. Maxwell, the Second 
Circuit's instruction that courts should manage their dockets to ensure that court filings are not 
abused was made in the context of providing alternatives to sealing, which the Court noted are 
"often preferable" to sealing, including "explaining on the record that the statements appear to lack 
credibility" and striking from the record materials that are "redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or 
The case relied on by Maxwell is not to the contrary. Instead, Martindell v. Int'l Tel. & TeL 
Corp., 594 F.2d 291, 297 (2d Cir. 1979), addresses only whether reliance on a valid protective 
order may be a considered as a countervailing interest to disclosure. But here, the Second Circuit 
has already held that the protective order was not valid, as implemented. See Brown v. Maxwell, 
929 F.3d 41 (2d. Cir. 2019). Therefore, Martindell is not applicable. Further, in later cases, the 
Second Circuit limited Martindell's ruling to cases involving documents that were not "judicial 
documents" subject to a presumption of access. See United States v. Amodeo, 44 F.3d 141 (2d Cir. 
1995). 
EFTA00017077
--- PAGE 5 ---
casQam§feZot4AceguneoUgnieAFP95?044leiPtit§f2V28aftbef51M 10 
scandalous." Brown, 929 F.3d at 49 n.28, 51-52. Ms. Maxwell's argument, here, turns that 
reasoning on its head. 
Ms. Maxwell also provides no basis for her conclusory statements that the documents at 
issue were "abusively filed" court records and files. 
C. 
Annoyance, Embarrassment, Oppression, and Undue Burden 
Rule 26 allows protective orders to issue that allow the sealing of materials upon a showing 
of good cause that they are likely to cause annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue 
burden. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26; Brown, 929 F.3d at 51. 
Simply stating that questions were "intrusive" or "embarrassing," however, is insufficient 
to meet the good cause standard of Rule 26, especially when the allegations at issue in the litigation 
concern the sexual abuse of young girls at the hands of the wealthy and powerful. Framing 
allegations of sexual abuse as "private" protects perpetrators at the expense of victims. The Miami 
Herald's coverage of Mr. Epstein's and his associates' alleged crimes has nothing to do with 
consensual sexual preferences and everything to do with the abuse of young girls, whether that 
crime was justly prosecuted or, instead, whether it was quietly dispensed with by the legal system 
to protect the reputations of well-connected adults. This is not information that could be 
reasonably characterized as exposing Ms. Maxwell to "annoyance" or "embarrassment" in a way 
that could support continued sealing under the good cause standard of Rule 26. 
D. 
Rights of Suspects Under Criminal Investigation 
Ms. Maxwell also claims that the mere existence of criminal investigations into Mr. Epstein 
and his associates' conduct warrants the sealing of materials because it is "unclear who are 
witnesses or targets of any investigation." Dkt. 1057, at 6. The cases she relies on stand for the 
general proposition that documents may sometimes be sealed to protect the integrity of criminal 
EFTA00017078
--- PAGE 6 ---
casceamgQAR6nag'49kcnenbt•NeffFiWo*lieZt3&@f2V2f?an§ef61•9f 10 
investigations. See United States v. Longueuil, 567 F.App'x 13, 16 (2d Cir. 2014) (finding it was 
not an abuse of discretion to allow continued sealing of discovery materials that were not judicial 
documents and that reflected sensitive information about cooperating witnesses and the 
government's investigative methods and techniques); Hardy v. Equitable Life Assurance Soc'y of 
United States, 697 F. App'x 723, 725 (2d Cir. 2017) (noting generally that protection of ongoing 
investigations and safety of witnesses may be countervailing interests). 
However, Ms. Maxwell's generalized assertion that there are ongoing criminal 
investigations is wholly insufficient to warrant sealing. See United States v. Huntley, 943 F. Supp. 
2d 383, 387 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) (denying request to seal in high-profile case and noting "Where will 
be no surprises to the potentially accused by the revelations of their names. Interference with 
ongoing investigations will be of almost no significance."). Further, it is completely unreasonable 
to allow Ms. Maxwell — a potential target of investigations — to assert this as a "countervailing 
interest" under the circumstances. This would lead to an absurd result in which court documents 
that could shed light on how Mr. Epstein's alleged crimes were kept secret for so long would be 
sealed to protect the perpetrators at the expense of victims and the public. 
E. 
Improper Submission of Documents 
Ms. Maxwell contends that documents submitted for a "non-merits purpose" should remain 
sealed or redacted if there is any interest in sealing or redaction. The case she cites, SEC v. 
TheStreetcom, 273 F.3d 222 (2d Cir. 2001), does not support this argument, nor are Intervenors 
aware of any case supporting this position. This position is directly in conflict with Brown v. 
Maxwell. 
EFTA00017079
--- PAGE 7 ---
casgamgric26140-9swienbt-ilnlefiFili004belt3gfrateafthef718f 10 
All of the documents at issue appear to have been submitted to the Court for purposes of 
an adjudication call upon the court to exercise its Article III powers and are judicial documents.' 
Ms. Maxwell's arguments to the contrary are wholly unsupported. 
F. 
Untrustworthy, Unreliable, and Incorrect Information 
Ms. Maxwell contends that material submitted to the court should not be unsealed because 
it is untrustworthy, unreliable, and incorrect. Again, Ms. Maxwell offers little support for those 
conclusions, relying on hearsay requirements found in the Federal Rules of Evidence.4 This 
argument conflates the admissibility requirements and sealing requirements. See Burton v. 
Zwicker & Assocs., No. CV 10-227-WOB-JGW, 2012 WL 12925759, at *1 (E.D. Ky. Sept. 24, 
2012) ("[D]efendant cites no authority—nor has the Court independently located any—which 
supports the sealing of documents based upon alleged evidentiary problems."); Krause v. Rhodes, 
535 F. Supp. 338, 354 (N.D. Ohio 1979), aff'd, 671 F.2d 212 (6th Cir. 1982) ("It is not a ground 
for a protective order as suggested by deponents' counsel, that the depositions contain hearsay 
answers or answers whose relevancy or competency might be suspect. The test of the propriety of 
a discovery deposition question or answer is not admissibility at trial, nor is admissibility at trial 
the test for entry of the depositions into the public domain."). 
Additionally, Ms. Maxwell's reference to issues that were briefed in various undecided motions 
in limine put those motions at issue. Therefore, under the Court's January 13, 2020 Order, these 
motions should also be unsealed. See Dkt. 1018. 
While Ms. Maxwell is correct that the Amodeo II court allowed some portions of a report 
containing hearsay to be sealed, it did so on the basis of specific assertions regarding the material, 
rather than the generalized assertions Ms. Maxwell offers.

III. 
The Specific Objections for Each of the Documents at Issue Also Do Not Justify 
Sealing. 
Notwithstanding the 17-page brief submitted by Maxwell, she has failed to identify with 
the required specificity any countervailing interest sufficient to overcome the substantial 
presumption of access. Instead, Maxwell repeatedly cites generalized concerns and asks the Court 
to broadly continue to seal entire documents based on those generalized concerns. These alleged 
"countervailing interests" are wholly insufficient to support the continued sealing of documents in 
this case. See New York v. Actavis, PLC, No. 14 CIV. 7473, 2014 WL 5353774, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. 
Oct. 21, 2014) (citing Lugosch, 435 F.3d at 124) (decisions to seal must be supported by "specific, 
on-the-record findings that sealing is necessary to preserve higher values and only if the sealing 
order is narrowly tailored to achieve that aim"). 
A. 
Dkt. 143 and Related Submissions 
Ms. Maxwell contends that these pleadings all concern Plaintiff's attempt to compel Ms. 
Maxwell to answer intrusive questions about her sex life. However, the related exhibits and 
submissions appear to be much broader and include deposition transcripts, a "Flight Log Summary 
Chart" and flight logs, and police reports. 
None of the reasons Ms. Maxwell identifies warrants sealing these materials: 
• 
J. Does 1 and 2 have not asserted any objections with regard to these materials, despite 
receiving notice and an opportunity to be heard. 
• 
Sexual content alone is insufficient to justify continued sealing of Ms. Maxwell's 
deposition transcript. This case concerns allegations of sexual assault and trafficking of 
minors. There is no recognized privacy interest in allegations of sex trafficking. Any 
privacy interest Ms. Maxwell may have is substantially outweighed by the public interest 
EFTA00017081

in disclosure, which will shed light on the abuse of young girls and women—and the 
system that allowed the abuse to continue. 
• 
There is no support for Ms. Maxwell's claims that the third-party depositions are 
unreliable. She simply claims that her counsel did not cross-examine the witnesses under 
oath. But this is the hearsay standard, not the sealing standard. See Section II.F. 
• 
Whether Ms. Maxwell is identified as a "suspect, a perpetrator, or participant" in the police 
reports is irrelevant to whether the police reports should be unsealed. Additionally, the 
police reports are public records under Florida's Sunshine Act. See Fla. AG Advisory 
Opinion AGO 80-96 ("...crime and arrest reports are not exempt from the inspection 
provisions of the Public Records Law..."). This lends additional support to the release of 
these documents in full here. 
B. 
Dkt. 153-1, Exhibits 4, 5, 6 and 7 
Ms. Maxwell claims that the third-party depositions are unreliable and inadmissible. Again, 
this is not the correct standard for sealing. See Section II.F. 
C. 
Dkt. 172 and Related Submissions 
Ms. Maxwell contends that this request was filed for an improper purpose because it could 
"have been a straightforward request by Plaintiff to exceed the presumptive 10 deposition limit set 
by the Court." Dkt. 1057, at 8. What this filing could have been is irrelevant to the Court's analysis: 
The relevant inquiry turns on what it was. 
Ms. Maxwell does not dispute that the Plaintiff made this request to the Court seeking 
judicial action and that the Court acted. The remaining arguments that Ms. Maxwell makes, 
including that these are not judicial documents, are all addressed above and/or are non-sequiturs. 
D. 
Dkt. 199 and Related Submissions 
EFTA00017082
--- PAGE 10 ---
casafr.i
et43gitsimmenbgirrieAFil4404thelPilskfigawafrcifolilf 10 
For the reasons set forth above, there is no basis for continuing to seal these documents. 
See Sections II.A, B, C, D. 
Further, Ms. Maxwell's claim that the Court's ruling on these documents is premature 
because they name other third parties who have not yet received notice is inconsistent with the 
Court's note in Dkt. 1053. There, the Court said that it was "amenable to unsealing portions of 
documents mentioning non-parties rather than waiting to unseal the entirety of a given document 
until all non-parties have provided input." Intervenors ask that the Court follow the approach set 
forth in Dkt. 1053. 
E. 
Dkt. 164 and Related Submissions 
It appears the Court has received no objections regarding these submissions, and they 
should be released (as to J. Does 1 and 2). 
F. 
Dkt. 230 and Related Submissions 
It appears the Court has received no objections regarding these submissions, and they 
should be released (as to J. Does 1 and 2). 
CONCLUSION 
For all of the foregoing reasons, Intervenors respectfully request that this Court unseal in 
their entirety Dkt. entries 143, 164, 172, 199, and 230 and their related submissions (as they pertain 
to J. Does 1 and 2).

er, Thomas" 
I hope you are well and getting some time "off" this summer. I'm reaching out via email as it may be the most efficient 
way to tee-up the inquiry we have received, but we can circulate a dial-in at a convenient time for you if you'd like to 
discuss anything. 
Deutsche Bank has received a third-party subpoena from the Attorney General's Office of the U.S. Virgin Islands in 
connection with a pending civil suit they have filed against Jeffrey Epstein's estate, the executors of the estate, and 
others. One of the requests is for a copy of any government subpoenas received by the Bank relating to Epstein, and a 
copy of any productions made pursuant to the subpoenas. Do we have your permission to disclose your subpoena and 
our production to you to the U.S.V.I. AG? Would you prefer us to refer the office to you directly or provide you with 
contact information? I'm happy to send you a copy of the U.S.V.I. AG subpoena if helpful in evaluating the request. 
Best,

New York, New York 10007 
August 5, 2020 
Re: 
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) 
Dear Counsel: 
This letter provides discovery pursuant to Rule 16(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal 
Procedure ("Fed. R. Crim. P."), and seeks reciprocal discovery.' 
Disclosure by the Government 
Based on your request for discovery in this case, enclosed please find copies of the 
materials listed in the attached index, which materials are stamped with control numbers 
SDNY GM 00000001 through SDNY_GM_00012841. If you wish to inspect any of the physical 
evidence referenced in these materials, including items listed on search inventories, please let us 
know, and we will make arrangements for you to do so. 
The Government recognizes its obligations under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), 
and its progeny. Pursuant to those obligations, we are disclosing the information below. This 
disclosure should not be taken to indicate that the Government believes the enclosed information 
constitutes Brady material. 
Rather, we make this disclosure in an abundance of caution. 
Specifically, the Government discloses the following: 
• 
The Government will provide material under Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 154 
(1972), and its progeny, in a timely manner prior to trial and consistent with the schedule set by 
the Court. 
In addition to information provided herein, please note that this Office periodically posts content 
on social media platforms including Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. Members of the public may 
post comments in response to the Office's postings. We do not control these user-generated 
comments, nor do we monitor or regularly review such comments. You may directly access these 
social media platforms in the event you believe someone may have posted information relevant to 
this case.

Disclosure by the Defendant 
In light of your request for discovery in this case, the Government hereby requests 
reciprocal discovery under Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(b). Specifically, we request that you allow 
inspection and copying of: (1) any books, or copies or portions thereof, which are in the 
defendant's possession, custody or control, and which the defendant intends to introduce as 
evidence or otherwise rely on at trial; and (2) any results or reports of physical or mental 
examinations and of scientific tests or experiments made in connection with this case, or copies 
thereof, which are in the defendant's possession or control, and which the defendant intends to 
introduce as evidence or otherwise rely on at trial or which were prepared by a witness whom the 
defendant intends to call at trial. 
The Government also requests that the defendant disclose prior statements of witnesses he 
will call to testify. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 26.2; United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225 (1975). We 
request that such material be provided on the same basis upon which we agree to supply the 
defendant with 3500 material relating to Government witnesses. 
Sentence Reduction for Acceptance of Responsibility 
This Office will oppose the additional one-point reduction under the Sentencing Guidelines 
available for defendants who plead prior to the Government's initiation of trial preparations 
pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(b), in the event your client has not entered a plea of guilty six weeks 
prior to trial. We will follow this policy whether or not suppression or other pretrial motions 
remain outstanding after this date and even if the trial date has not been announced by the Court 
six weeks in advance of the trial. 
Finally, please be advised that pursuant to the policy of the Office concerning plea offers, 
no plea offer is effective unless and until made in writing and signed by authorized representatives 
of the Office. In particular, discussions regarding the pretrial disposition of a matter that are not 
reduced to writing and signed by authorized representatives of the Office cannot and do not 
constitute a "formal offer" or a "plea offer," as those terms are used in Lefler v. Cooper, 132 S.Ct. 
1376 (2012); Missouri v. Flye, 132 S.Ct. 1399 (2012).

----------------------------------------
Jeffrey and Ghislaine have been together, a couple, for the last 11 years. 
They are, contrary to what many people think, rarely apart — I almost always 
see them together 
Ghislaine is highly intelligent, and great company with a ready smile and an 
infectious laugh who always puts one at ones ease, and always makes one 
feel welcome. 
Jeffrey and Ghislaine share many mutual interests and they have a lot of fun 
together. They both have keen searching and inquisitive minds. She grew 
up amongst scientists and in an academic and business environment. 
They share a love of travel and art. She speaks 5 languages. She enjoys 
spending time visiting auction houses (she says that is the best way to learn 
about art and antiques — your expected to look touch and ask questions) 
Ghislaine also has her own interests and has her own business pursuits — she 
is independent and strong willed - something which Jeffrey loves about her -
She is adventurous - she flies helicopters, she is athletic — she rides horses, 
plays tennis, skis and scuba dives. She is a serious photographer (she always 
has a camera in hand) who is collaborating with some of the leading people 
involved at the cutting edge of digital photography. 
Jeffrey and Ghislaine compliment each other really well and I cannot 
imagine one without the other. On top of being great partners they are also 
the best of friends.

Re: 
United States v. Tartaglione, 16-cr-832 — Unsealing of Judicial Records 
Dear Judge Karas: 
I write on behalf of The New York Times Company and reporter Benjamin 
Weiser (jointly, "The Times") regarding the Government's application to seal 
two recent filings in this case. The Times agrees with the New York Post and the 
Daily Netts (see Dkt. 155) that the application has no merit: the filings are 
judicial documents subject to the common law and First Amendment rights of 
access, and the high bar required for overcoming these rights has not been met.' 
The Government has sought to seal records related to Mr. Tartaglione's August 
20, 2019 application to "be moved from the [Metropolitan Correctional Center] 
and detained at another facility." Dkt. 147 at 1. As the basis for his application, 
Mr. Tartaglione's counsel cited the "constant and deplorable" conditions at the 
MCC and perceived threats to his client's safety from MCC guards. Id. at 2. 
Those threats, he says, arise from his client's speaking up about both the 
conditions at MCC and the attempted suicide of his former and now-late cellmate 
Jeffrey Epstein. Id. at 1-2. The Government submitted a sealed response to the 
application on August 23; Mr. Tartaglione responded in turn, also in a sealed 
The right of access is an affirmative, enforceable public right, and the 
standing of the press to enforce it is well settled. See, e.g., Globe Newspaper Co. 
v. Superior Court, 457 U.S. 596, 609 n.25 (1982); Hanford Courant Co. v. 
Pellegrino, 380 F.3d 83, 91 (2d Cir. 2004).

filing, on August 28. See Dkt. 152. On August 29, the Government belatedly 
filed applications to seal both documents. Dkts. 151, 152. The Government 
contends that the documents are not judicial documents subject to the right of 
access and that even if they were certain portions of each document should be 
redacted. See Dkts. 151, 152. 
For reasons stated by the Post and Daily News, the Government is wrong on both 
counts. Under the Second Circuit's access jurisprudence, a "judicial document" is 
an item "relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the 
judicial process." United States v. Amodeo, 44 F.3d 141, 145 (2d Cir. 1995). A 
common law presumption of access attaches to any judicial document, and an 
additional First Amendment right arises where public access to a document has 
been historically available (the "experience" prong) and would be valuable to the 
process in question (the "logic" prong). Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 
435 F.3d 110, 119-20 (2d Cir. 2006). The weight of the common law 
presumption turns on "the role of the material at issue in the exercise of Article 
III judicial power" and "the resultant value of such information to those 
monitoring the federal courts." Bernstein v. Bernstein Litowitz Berger & 
Grossmann LLP, 814 F.3d 132, 142 (2d Cir. 2016) (citation and internal marks 
omitted). Once the right of access attaches, it is overcome only by 
"countervailing factors" (under the common law) or specific, on-the-record 
findings that sealing "is essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly 
tailored to serve that interest" (under the First Amendment). Id. at 143-45 
(citations and internal marks omitted). 
The Government contends that the papers filed in connection with Mr. 
Tartaglione's transfer application are not judicial documents because they have 
"no bearing on the charges contained in the pending indictment" and instead 
address a matter "ancillary to his criminal prosecution."2 Dkt. 151 at 1. Not so. 
As an initial matter, what makes a record a "judicial document" is not whether it 
"directly affect[s]" a criminal prosecution, id. at 2, but what role it plays in the 
performance of a judicial function. Applying this standard, the courts have found 
the right of access to reach a wide range of records in criminal proceedings. See, 
e.g., United States v. Suarez, 880 F.2d 626, 630-31 (2d Cir. 1989) (First 
Amendment right of access to forms used for payments to court-appointed 
counsel); United States v. Graham, 257 F.3d 143, 151-53 (2d Cir. 2001) 
(common law right attaches to audio and video tapes played at pretrial detention 
hearing); Applications of National Broadcasting Co., 828 F.2d 340, 344-45 (6th 
Though the Government articulated this reason only in its application to 
seal its own filing, its position on Mr. Tartaglione's filing is presumably based on 
the same reasoning. 
EFTA00017096
--- PAGE 3 ---
Cir. 1987) (First Amendment right of access to records related to motions for 
disqualification of judge and for inquiry into attorney conflicts of interest). 
The filings sought to be sealed here easily meet the standard for judicial 
documents. In seeking a "court order" for his transfer from MCC, Dkt. 147 at I, 
Mr. Tartaglione expressly called upon the Court to exercise its adjudicatory 
power over a matter within its purview. Though the Government characterizes its 
response to the application as nothing more than a "status report," Dkt. 151 at 2, 
its filing and Mr. Tartaglione's response both pertained to the application and 
were directed at guiding the Court's resolution of it.3 That makes them judicial 
documents. 
What's more, the weight of the common law presumption of access to these 
records is undeniably strong. In Graham, the Second Circuit found that the 
presumption of access for tapes played at a pretrial detention hearing was, at a 
minimum, "substantial": "The detention of criminal defendants pending trial is a 
quintessential exercise of a court's Article III judicial power, and the public has a 
legitimate interest monitoring a court's use of that power." 257 F.3d at 154. So 
too, here. Adjudicating a defendant's grievances about his pretrial confinement, 
which has apparently impacted the exercise of his constitutional rights, are 
matters at the heart of the judicial function. And the public has a considerable 
interest in monitoring how the court discharges that function. Perhaps more than 
anything, the public's confidence in the judiciary depends on openness of court 
records and proceedings. On this point, Chief Justice Burger's words in 
Richmond Newspapers v. Virginia are particularly apt: 
People in an open society do not demand infallibility from their 
institutions, but it is difficult for them to accept what they are prohibited 
from observing. When a criminal trial is conducted in the open, there is 
at least an opportunity both for understanding the system in general and 
its workings in a particular case. 
This is true regardless of the merits of Mr. Tartaglione's application. 
The Government asserts that "[a] pre-trial detainee does not have the right to be 
housed at the facility of his choice." Dkt. 151 at 2 (citation and internal marks 
omitted). The Times does not take the Government to be arguing that the 
conditions of Mr. Tartaglione's confinement or his personal safety are entirely 
outside the Court's purview or that the Court is without any power whatsoever to 
address those matters. 
EFTA00017097
--- PAGE 4 ---
448 U.S. 555, 572 (1980) (plurality opinion).4
The seriousness of Mr. Tartaglione's alleged grievances here bear emphasis, too. 
As the Post and Daily News point out, the conditions of Mr. Tartaglione's 
confinement "relate to his ability to prepare for trial and present an adequate 
defense." Dkt. 155 at 1. His attorney claims that his client's opportunities to 
review legal documents have been limited, and that members of the legal team 
have sometimes waited "hours" to see him. Dkt. 147 at 1. Whether "direct0" or 
not, Dkt. 151 at 2, the impact of a transfer on Mr. Tartaglione's prosecution is 
potentially significant. 
On the question of whether the access right is overcome, the Government's 
arguments again fall short. It says that portions of Mr. Tartaglione's filing 
"restate the internal deliberations of the BOP" and that their disclosure would 
jeopardize the agency's "law enforcement functions and internal deliberative 
processes." Dkt. 152. It elaborates on these points in its application to seal its 
own filing. See Dkt. 151 at 3 (disclosing considerations that inform BOP 
decisionmaking would hamper candid communications and cause "inmates to 
alter their behavior and manipulate their housing assignments"). 
Though obviously not privy to these portions of the filings, The Times is 
skeptical that disclosure would cause the parade of horribles described by BOP. 
BOP suggests that the deliberative material in its filing would be exempt from 
disclosure under Exemption 5 of the Freedom of Information Act. Id. at 3. To 
begin with, FOIA — a right of access created solely by statute — has no bearing on 
the common law or constitutional right of access. FOIA, by its terms, does not 
apply to the judiciary, and public access to judicial documents is premised on the 
Both prongs of the First Amendment analysis are met, too: there is a 
history of public access to proceedings related to conditions of confinement, and 
openness of those proceedings and records would undoubtedly enhance the 
functioning of the process. Cf., e.g., Newman v. Graddiek, 696 F.2d 796, 801 
(11th Cir. 1983) (right of access to civil trials pertaining to confinement 
conditions); Graham, 257 F.3d at 154 ("The bail decision is one of major 
importance to the administration of justice, and openness will help to assure the 
public that the decision is properly reached.") (quoting In re Globe Newspaper 
Co., 729 F.2d 47, 52 (1st Cir. 1984) (internal marks omitted)). And even if there 
were no history of openness, the mere "logic" of public access is a sufficient 
basis for the First Amendment right. See, e.g., Suarez, 880 F.2d at 631; United 
States v. Index Newspapers LLC, 766 F.3d 1072, 1094 (9th Cir. 2014) ("logic 
alone, even without experience, may be enough to establish the [First 
Amendment] right") (citation and internal marks omitted). 
EFTA00017098
--- PAGE 5 ---
public's historic need to monitor the functioning of the courts. See, e.g., Eil v. 
U.S. Drug Enforcement Admin., 878 F.3d 392, 398 (1st Cir. 2017). 
Even were that not so, and FOIA were relevant (it is not), there is no reason to 
think that the information contained in the BOP filing is genuinely deliberative,5
or that the Government could show — as access jurisprudence requires it to — that 
disclosure poses some credible risk of harm. See, e.g., Bernstein, 814 F.3d at 143 
(finding that disclosure would not "reveal details of an ongoing investigation, 
pose a risk to witnesses, endanger national security, or reveal trade secrets"). It 
seems unlikely that publicly disclosing the factors that BOP considered in 
deciding whether to transfer Mr. Tartaglione — matters that BOP was comfortable 
disclosing to Mr. Tartaglione himself and to this Court — would actually have a 
chilling effect on agency deliberations. 
Nor is there serious reason to think that inmates, armed with this new 
information, would succeed in any effort to "manipulate their housing 
assignments." Setting aside the question of whether, as a general matter, inmates 
should be kept in the dark about the reasons for their assignment to a given 
facility, BOP has made clear that Mr. Tartaglione's case is "exceptional." Dkt. 
151 at 3. Inmates "seeking to take advantage of similar accommodations," id., 
would be on notice of that fact. And even if some inmates cynically tried to 
obtain those accommodations, The Times trusts that BOP, with its substantial 
expertise and experience in these matters, would see through those efforts. In 
short, BOP's proffered basis for sealing does not meet the high burden imposed 
by the common law, particularly in the face of a weighty presumption of access.6
See, e.g., Graham, 257 F.3d at 154-55; Bernstein, 814 F.3d at 143-44. 
On a final note, the immense public interest in these proceedings is worth 
highlighting. Even before Mr. Tartaglione became Jeffrey Epstein's cellmate, 
there was substantial public attention on his case because of the nature of the 
$ The deliberative process privilege in Exemption 5 is limited to material 
that is both "predecisional," i.e., "prepared in order to assist an agency 
decisionmaker in arriving at his decision," and "deliberative," i.e., "actually 
related to the process by which policies are formulated." Hopkins v. U.S. Dep't of 
Nous. & Urban Dev., 929 F.2d 81, 84 (2d Cir. 1991) (citations, alteration, and 
internal marks omitted). 
Because the basis for sealing is insufficient to overcome the common 
law right of access, it also necessarily cannot defeat the First Amendment right. 
See Lugosch, 435 F.3d at 124. 
EFTA00017099
--- PAGE 6 ---
charges against him and the prosecutors' decision to seek the death penalty.? Mr. 
Epstein's attempted suicide, which occurred while Mr. Tartaglione was his 
cellmate, roused even greater interest in his case! Put simply, the public is 
watching this case. The public is aware of Mr. Tartaglione's claims that BOP 
correctional officers have sought to silence him.9 The irony of the Government's 
efforts to keep records regarding those claims out of public view is surely not lost 
on it. 
We thank the Court for its consideration.

Statement of Jane Doe 
Phone: 
I was a model in another country when I came to the United States. I was 
told by a booker that I needed to meet with a man named Jeffrey Epstein who 
was the owner of Victoria's Secret. The booker told me that Mr. Epstein could 
help me get into the Victoria's Secret world. It was my childhood dream to be a 
Victoria's Secret model. So I went one day in the afternoon and met Mr. Epstein 
in his office in his mansion in New York. 
A woman introduced herself and suggested to me that I should be 
extremely nice to Mr. Epstein, because if he liked me, he would probably have 
photographers shooting photos of me right away. The woman told me to go 
upstairs and directed me to Jeffrey Epstein's office. Mr. Epstein had a white robe 
on and we chatted very briefly. I had my portfolio of photos, but he didn't even 
take a look at it. Suddenly, he took his robe off and got close to me. I got up to 
leave, but the door was locked. I didn't know what was going on. It was my first 
official meeting to be cast in the United States. I was a young girl and confused. 
He got very close to me and I had a skirt on. He started to

At that point I ran to the door again and figured out 
how to get out of there. A girl outside asked me where I was going and she said 
to be careful. She said that Mr. Epstein knew a lot of powerful people, including 
Bill Clinton, and that if I didn't do what Mr. Epstein wanted, I would not be able to 
have any job in the industry. I was so scared, I couldn't wait to get out of there 
and I left. I took the train home. I had spent all of my savings getting Victoria's 
Secret lingerie to prepare for what I thought would be my audition, but instead it 
seemed like a casting call for prostitution. I felt like I was in hell.

For the last three witnesses it was pre-trial. But that was when we had an open indictment.

(In open court) 
THE COURT: All right. So the first thing that I 
think we should address, sounds like it might be a brief 
conversation, is the Curcio issue I had alerted the government 
that there is -- a Curcio issue has arisen. I had appointed 
Ms. Sternheim to be Curcio counsel. She's here. 
MS. STERNHEIM: Yes. 
THE COURT: But my understanding -- Ms. Sternheim, 
you'll let me know if I'm wrong about this -- that we're not 
yet ready to address all the issues. I know you've been 
working diligently on it, but we're not quite done; is that 
right? 
MS. STERNHEIM: That is correct, Judge. And I can 
contact the parties and your Honor as to a schedule if that is 
helpful, but I do not have that in place. 
THE COURT: Okay. That's fine. That sounds like a 
good suggestion, and we can go from there. So I'll thank you 
again for taking on this assignment. I thank you for being 
here today and for the update. 
The next issue, I think it makes sense to address, is 
this question of sealing the correspondence with regard to 
prison conditions, prison designation and then I think we have 
to resolve the issue of Mr. Tartaglione's housing. So I've 
read all the letters. 
I don't know, Ms. 
if you want to add anything. 
EFTA00017109
--- PAGE 2 ---
MS. 
No, your Honor. I have nothing to add. 
We'll rest on our papers. 
THE COURT: Okay. 
And I take it that counsel for Mr. Tartaglione remain 
agnostic on this issue; is that right? 
MR. BARKET: Yes. 
THE COURT: Okay. All right. So what we're talking 
about here is the government's request to seal letters that 
have been docketed. There have been redacted versions filed, 
but we're talking about Docket Numbers 150 and 153. 
And the background of this is that back on 
August 21st there was a conference where we discussed, among 
other things, issues related to Mr. Tartaglione's housing in 
the MCC, and what I had asked the government to do is inquire 
about options for housing Mr. Tartaglione at either the MCC or 
MDC because those are the only two Bureau of Prisons facilities 
in the New York metropolitan area. Because it turns out that 
the other facilities, whether they were in Nassau County or 
here in Westchester County or in other counties, those are not 
federal facilities and those facilities either didn't have 
contracts with the Southern District Marshals, or otherwise had 
advised that they were not going to house Mr. Tartaglione. So 
the particular question was whether or not MDC would be willing 
to take Mr. Tartaglione back, and we had had a pretty fulsome 
discussion about the issues that had led to Mr. Tartaglione's 
EFTA00017110
--- PAGE 3 ---
transfer from MDC to MCC. 
The government followed up, as I had asked it to, 
with a letter dated August 23rd, and that's the letter, the 
first letter the government ask be placed under seal that 
addressed the issue about housing Mr. Tartaglione at MDC and 
MCC, and the government, as I said, asked that the letter be 
sealed. The Court, on August 26th, temporarily filed it under 
seal, but then asked the government to further explain its 
reasons for permanently sealing that letter. 
On August 28th, counsel for Mr. Tartaglione filed a 
letter which addressed the merits of the government's housing 
options as presented in the August 23rd letter and counsel had 
asked that that letter be filed under seal because it was 
responsive to the government's letter which had been filed 
under seal. 
On August 29th, the government filed a letter arguing 
that its August 23rd letter or at least a portion of it should 
ne filed under seal because it addressed Bureau of Prisons' 
reasoning for either why it was that certain things had been 
considered and certain steps that the Bureau of Prisons thought 
would be necessary to house Mr. Tartaglione, and also the 
government filed a letter stating that the August 28th letter 
should remain under seal, that is, counsel for Mr. Tartaglione. 
On September 5th, the New York Post and the New York 
Daily News filed a letter arguing for the unsealing of the 
EFTA00017111
--- PAGE 4 ---
letters. They were joined by the New York Times on 
September 10th. 
The government, as the Court had previously asked, 
had submitted a response to I guess the first letter from The 
Post and the Daily News explaining why and really reiterating 
its argument for sealing and that's when counsel for 
Mr. Tartaglione announced their agnosticism on the issue. 
So the question actually has a couple of layers to 
it. So the first question is whether or not the government's 
letters are considered judicial documents. And a judicial 
document is an item that is, "relevant to the performance of 
the judicial function and useful in the judicial process," and 
that's from the Second Circuit's decision in Bernstein v 
Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann LLP, 814 F.3d 132, 139, 
quoting from an earlier Second Circuit's decision in a case 
called Lugosch v Pyramid Company of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110, 
119. The mere filing, however, of anything, whether it's some 
kind of a document or a letter with the court by itself doesn't 
render such a document a judicial document. That's from the 
Second Circuit's decision in US versus Amodeo, 44 F.3d 141, 
145. But if an item is a judicial document, then the public 
has a presumptive right of access to it under both the common 
law and the First Amendment. Also from Amodeo. The purpose of 
this right is to ensure that courts are held accountable and 
that the public has "confidence in the administration of 
EFTA00017112
--- PAGE 5 ---
justice." Also from Amodeo. 
Under the common law analysis, the Court is to 
determine the weight of the presumption of access. "Generally, 
the information will fall somewhere on a continuum from matters 
that directly affect an adjudication to matters that come 
within the court's purview solely to ensure their irrelevance." 
That's from the second Amodeo case, 731 F.3d at 1049. 
"Finally, after determining the weight of the 
presumption of access, the Court must 'balance competing 
considerations against it.'" Lugosch at page 120. 
Competing considerations include both "the danger of 
impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency," or "the 
privacy of interests of those resisting disclosure." 
The first Amendment analysis requires two different 
approaches. The first considers "experience and logic," that 
is, "whether the documents have historically been open to the 
press and general public" and "whether public access plays a 
significant and positive role in the function of the particular 
process in question." That's from Bernstein at page 141. 
The second approach which applies when the judicial 
proceedings themselves are covered by the First Amendment 
considers whether the documents are "derived from or a 
necessary corollary of the capacity to attend the relevant 
proceedings." That's from Lugosch at 120. 
Under either approach, the moving party has to 
EFTA00017113
--- PAGE 6 ---
demonstrate that sealing is "essential to preserve higher 
values and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest." 
Bernstein at 134. Further, the Court has to make "specific, 
on-the-record findings...demonstrating that closure is 
essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to 
serve that interest." Lugosch at 120. 
So the Government's argument is that the August 23rd 
letter, in the first instance, is that the August 23rd letter 
doesn't qualify as a judicial document because it has no 
bearing on the charges contained in the pending indictment" and 
"the location where [Mr. Tartaglione] is to be detained pending 
trial is ancillary to this criminal prosecution." So in the 
Government's view, its August 23rd letter is status report 
about the BOP's "internal deliberations." 
The government argues in the alternative that even if 
it is a judicial document, that redacting certain information, 
including most specifically BOP's explanation of 
Mr. Tartaglione's housing options, is appropriate. And that's 
because, according to the government "the BOP maintains that 
the public filing of those paragraphs would jeopardize its law 
enforcement functions and inappropriately hamper its interim 
deliberative processes." I guess the SOP is arguing that any 
presumption of access is overcome because the letter also, to 
the extent it's even a judicial document, it still addresses 
what BOP considers an ancillary matter. And so a public filing 
EFTA00017114
--- PAGE 7 ---
would "hinder the internal deliberative process of the MDC and 
thereby jeopardies the BOP's ability to carry out its function 
of securing pretrial defendants," because the letter provides 
details that were "taken into account to make an appropriate 
housing decision for a defendant charged with multiple 
murders." Also, the assertion is the public filing of the 
document, the letter, would "risk circumvention of the law" 
because "the public revelation of internal deliberations" would 
"enable all inmates to alter their behavior and manipulate 
their housing assignments to cause harm to others or engage in 
illicit behavior." 
The aforementioned media organizations argue that the 
letter, the letter of August 23rd, is a judicial document 
because it was submitted to the Court for purposes seeking or 
opposing an adjudication, and also that there's significant 
public interest in the conditions in BOP facilities, and 
finally the conditions of Mr. Tartaglione's confinement are 
relative to his case and his rights. 
So addressing the threshold question about whether 
the August 23rd and August 28th letters are judicial documents, 
the Court concludes that they are. While the letters 
themselves may not directly address the actual charges filed 
against Mr. Tartaglione, that is not the governing standard. 
The correct standard I've already mentioned is broader than 
that, and therefore, in my view, the letters are "relevant to 
EFTA00017115
--- PAGE 8 ---
the performance of a judicial function and useful in a judicial 
process." First of all, the letters were filed in response to 
a court order. So calling them a nonjudicial document seems 
anomalous as they were directed as part of the judiciary's 
overseeing of this case. 
Second, the letter is related to an issue, that is, 
Mr. Tartaglione's conditions of confinement, that could 
substantially impact his ability to mount a defense and thus 
are directly related to his trial rights, his constitutional 
rights, among other things, to defend himself. 
Indeed, the housing issue has been repeatedly raised 
by counsel for Mr. Tartaglione precisely on that ground, and I 
think understandably so, and so the relevance of the letters 
follows from the relevance of Mr. Tartaglione's conditions, and 
of course it's not irrelevant that this is a capital case. 
The proof of that is that the issues that are 
addressed in the letters have been addressed here in open court 
really from the very first time that these issues have been 
raised. 
So put it in the language of the Second Circuit, the 
specific contents of the letters are "relevant to the nature of 
the proceeding," that is, how Mr. Tartaglione is being housed 
in connection with his ability to defend himself in this 
capital case. And I think it certainly is the case that 
access, public access to the letters "would materially assist 
EFTA00017116
--- PAGE 9 ---
in the public's understanding of these housing issues before 
the Court in evaluating the fairness and integrity of the 
Court's proceedings." That's from Second Circuit's decision in 
Newsday LLC County of Nassau, 730 F.3d 156, 166-67. And of 
course all this, in the Court's view, is consistent with 
holding those of us in the criminal justice system accountable 
for what it is we do. 
So given the letters are judicial documents, the 
Court proceeds to consider the weight of the presumption of 
access and whether any competing interest overcomes the weight 
of access such that portions of the letters may be redacted. 
There is, I think, at the outset a waiver issue, 
because a lot of even the deliberative process of the MDC has 
been discussed before. So, for example, some of the 
disciplinary issues that Mr. Tartaglione had they have been 
discussed. There's been a great deal of discussion involving 
conversation with counsel for MCC all the various things MCC 
has had 20 do to accommodate Mr. Tartaglione's concerns, and 
there's been a great deal of discussion, 
conversations for Mr. Tartaglione and MCC 
for the government and MCC officials, but 
weight of the presumptive right of access 
for example, about 
officials and counsel 
in any event, the 
here is heavy. This 
is a capital case. Given the obvious stakes involved, the 
public has a deep interest in ensuring judicial accountability 
in all aspects of the case, including adjudicating any 
EFTA00017117
--- PAGE 10 ---
grievances related to pretrial confinement that might affect 
Mr. Tartaglione's ability to defend himself in the case. Of 
course that goes to the very fairness of the proceedings. Also 
the public has an interest in the conditions of confinement in 
BOP facilities in general. Anything that would suggest to the 
contrary would be Kafkaesque. And Mr. Tartaglione's conditions 
in particular, and in ensuring that BOP's decision-making on 
inmate housing is reasonable seems to me precisely the kind of 
thing that should be accessible to the public. So I think 
BOP's argument in that regard falters. 
To the extent BOP is arguing that its deliberative 
process in this case satisfies the sort of compelling interest 
that could justify sealing the portions of the letters that it 
wants sealed, it bears noting that the parties seeking sealing 
that wants to overcome this presumption has to show that 
sealing will further a compelling interest, such as a law 
enforcement concern, a national security concern, a public 
safety concern. Obviously privilege is certainly a valid 
concern, as are privacy interests. And the burden, of course, 
is on BOP to make that showing. But I don't think SOP has done 
that here. The deliberative processes that BOP is talking 
about are not protocols, for example, that it never publicizes 
as to how it is that it might secure inmates at a facility. 
That would be different. That could very well be a situation 
where disclosure of how BOP addresses specific security 
EFTA00017118
--- PAGE 11 ---
concerns could alert 
and put not only BOP 
at risk. That's not 
people to then circumvent those concerns 
officials at risk but also other inmates 
what we're talking about here. We're 
talking about the deliberative process that BOP says it engaged 
in in evaluating where to house Mr. Tartaglione and how in 
particular it would do so at MDC and MCC. 
So, for example, to the extent that Bureau of Prisons 
:as some concerns about housing Mr. Tartaglione in the general 
housing and explains why, a lot of the things that letters that 
the BOP had the government put in its letter are things that 
people know. So the fact that Mr. Tartaglione is facing the 
death penalty, the fact that he used to be in law enforcement, 
the fact that there's been this whole public scrutiny over what 
happened with Mr. Epstein and Mr. Tartaglione being involved in 
that, these are things that are commonly known. So to the 
extent that the BOP took factors that were commonly known into 
its so-called deliberative process in evaluating how it is that 
he could be housed at the two facilities, including, by the 
way, the fact that there have been prior disciplinary issues, 
that's also been publically discussed here in Court, and it's 
been the subject of letters. So the cellphone thing, for 
example, and other prior disciplinary issues, that's all been 
publicly discussed, and to the extent BOP took all those things 
into consideration, I think it's hard for BOP to argue that 
taking into consideration factors that were publicly known 
EFTA00017119
--- PAGE 12 ---
about how it is best to house Mr. Tartaglione is the type of 
discussion of security protocols that otherwise aren't public. 
So I think it distinguishes between what BOP has done here and 
what it maybe does in coming up with very specific protocols, 
either as to a particular individual or as to how it is it 
houses people generally at its facilities. 
So I just don't see how unsealing the letters and 
revealing the deliberative process is something that's going to 
uniquely publicize certain things that are going to jeopardize 
BOP officials or other inmates. For example, to the extent BOP 
argues a disclosure could lead to bad behavior, that inmates 
could manipulate their housing assignments, I just don't see 
that here. 
There are certain things about Mr. Tartaglione that 
he has no control over. He has no control over the fact 
that -- in terms of things he can change. He was a law 
enforcement officer. The fact that BOP took that 
consideration, I don't see how somebody can manipulate that to 
somehow pretend that, for example, they weren't a law 
enforcement officer. You can't change your history. So I just 
don't understand how that's going to somehow lead to 
circumvention of security protocols. 
So I just don't think BOP has made the case that the 
public disclosure is going to risk harming anybody, and so give 
given the BOP'S, in my view, failure to establish a compelling 
EFTA00017120
--- PAGE 13 ---
interest to overcome the presumption of public access, I'm 
going to order the letters be unsealed. 
If BOP wants to have you go to the Second Circuit, 
can you let me know. I mean, I'll wait a day, Ms. 
if 
they're that concerned, but you'll let me know by the end of 
business tomorrow? 
MS. COMEY: Yes, your Honor. 
the ocurt: Okay, thank you. 
All right, any updates from the government? 
MS. 
Your Honor, we remain in the same place 
we were last time, the government is ready for trial. We would 
ask the Court to set a trial date. 
THE COURT: Okay. 
Mr. Barket. 
MR. BARKET: Well, I mean, before I get to the trial 
date part, we actually have something to say about that today. 
THE COURT: Yes. 
MR. BARKET: I'm curious about the issue concerning 
the telephone which has been stewing for some while. 
MS. 
The government will not be seeking a 
warrant for that phone. 
THE COURT: Okay. 
MR. BARKET: I guess, less work. 
On the issue of the trial date, we have had some 
discussions among counsel as to laying out what we think is a 
EFTA00017121
--- PAGE 14 ---
reasonable schedule among us. We've had a preliminary 
conversation about it with Mr. Tartaglione. We are still in 
the process of kind of finalizing that. So what I'm going to 
suggest to the Court is that you allow that process to continue 
internally, and that before the next Court date we'll have 
completed it, met with the government, proposed it to them and 
hopefully gotten their agreement on it and then we can come 
back with a joint scheduling order all the way through to the 
trial.

AT&T does not retain records that can definitively show whether a transaction was 
customer initiated or AT&T's network initiated the data transaction.
