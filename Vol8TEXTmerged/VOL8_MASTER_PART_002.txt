INSTRUCTIONS FOR CONTINUED AIRWORTHINESS 
SYSTEM DESCRIPTION 
1.1 GENERAL 
This STC will include installations and/or updates to equipment to allow for Automatic dependent 
surveillance —broadcast Out (ADS-B Out). ADS-B periodically broadcasts information about each 
aircraft, such as identification, current position, altitude, and velocity, through an onboard transmitter. 
The equipment list in Table 2 below details the equipment required for this installation. 
The TDR-94/94D Transponder(s) will be upgraded to part number 622-9352-502 (94) or 622-
9210-502 (94D), if not previously installed. The TDR-94/94D Transponder is an all solid-state, 
crystal-controlled receiver/transmitter. 
The transponder(s) will get the GPS information from either a newly installed Freeflight GPS1203C 
GPS receiver and dedicated GPS antenna; or, a GPS-4000S GPS receiver. Depending on the 
aircraft configuration, the GPS-4000/A/S may be previously installed. If the previously installed GPS-
4000/A/S is not a part number 822-2189-004/005/006/007/010/011/100 it will have to be upgraded 
to one of these part numbers. (Reference Tables shown on drawing 584-00-0004 for applicable GPS 
installation based on aircraft model) 
Wiring is added dependent on the installed or replaced GPS receiver(s), Transponder(s), and 
annunciator installed. (Reference Tables shown on drawing 584-00-0004 for applicable installations 
based on aircraft model and subsequent Wire Routing drawing 584-00-0005).See section 6.1.9 for 
details on inspection. 
An optional ADS-B Out annunciator can be installed to alert the pilot that the ADS-B function of the 
active transponder is not properly functioning. The ADS-B Out annunciator is required for all 
standalone GPS installations. Standalone means the GPS only provides data to the transponders. 
All 1203C installations and 4000S installations that only connect to the transponders are standalone. 
It can be installed as an option for installations where the 4000S is used for both ADS-B and FMS 
navigation. ((Reference Tables shown on drawing 584-00-0004 for applicable ADS-B Out 
Annunciator installation based on aircraft model)

Eddy Current Inspection 
For eddy current inspection requirements and procedures, refer to the referenced documents in the 
table below for the different aircraft types. 
The following documents describe the various procedures and requirements for HF eddy current 
inspection including personnel, instrumentation, equipment setup and standardization, probes, special 
tools and equipment eddy current standards, and eddy current test procedures required by the Cessna 
Aircraft Company. 
The defects identified by this method are incipient fatigue or corrosion stress cracks in bores, 
machining radii, shoulders and countersunk holes, and in the actual skin. The direction of propagation 
defects are perpendicular to in-flight stresses in the case of fatigue stress cracks, or perpendicular to 
internal stresses for stress corrosion cracks. This method also detects minor corrosion-induced surface 
damage.

Recommended inspection/maintenance intervals do not guarantee that the item will function 
properly between inspection/maintenance checks. The inspection intervals are based on 
average usage and environmental conditions. Aircraft operated under extreme conditions, 
(extreme hot, extreme cold, high humidity, salty air, etc.) may require more frequent 
maintenance than the intervals specified in this document. The aircraft operator may perform 
more frequent inspection/maintenance checks based on his usage. 
6.1.2 Visual Inspections 
The equipment necessary for conducting a visual inspection usually consists of a strong flashlight, a 
mirror with a ball joint, and a 2.5x — 4x magnifying glasses. A 10x magnifying glass is recommended 
for positive identification of suspected cracks. 
6.1.3 Corrosion Treatment 
Before attempting a close, visual inspection of any selected part or structural area, it should be checked 
for signs of corrosion. Any corrosion found should be tested to discover its extent and severity. Heavy 
or severe corrosion requires immediate corrective action. If mild corrosion is present, it should be 
carefully, but completely, removed before continuing with preparations for the visual inspection. 
6.1.4 Structural Failure Determination. 
The first step in a visual inspection should be an examination of the area for deformed or missing 
fasteners. These should be identified for subsequent replacement. A close examination for cracks in 
the surfaces of structural members should then be made with the aid of a flashlight. The majorities of 
cracks start at, and progress from, points of concentrated stress such as sharp corner cutouts and 
fastener holes. Cracks may also occur in sheet metal bend radii and similar places that were subjected 
to severe forming operations during manufacture.

6.1.5 Cleaning of Structural Parts 
All parts of areas from which mild corrosion has been removed should be thoroughly cleaned using an 
approved solvent. (Metal conditioner should not be applied at this time as it may interfere with 
subsequent dye penetrant inspection.) 
6.1.6 Cleaning Other Areas 
All other areas to be inspected should also be cleaned of any deposits that might hinder the discovery 
of existing surface flaws. The protective finish need not be removed. The cleaning should be 
performed using any approved solvent. For cleaning high heat-treat steel parts, or areas in which a 
high heat steel part is installed, use only the approved solvents. 
6.1.7 Crack Detection Technique 
When looking for surface cracks, the inspector should point his flashlight towards himself and hold it at 
an angle of 5° - 45° to the surface. (See Figure 6) The extent of the crack may be traced by directing 
the beam at right angles to the crack. Never direct the light beam at such an angle that the reflected 
beam shines directly into the eyes. The proper procedure is to keep the eyes above the reflected 
beam.

A "visual inspection" is defined as the process of using the eye, alone or in conjunction with various 
aids, as the sensing mechanism from which judgments may be made about the condition of a unit to be 
inspected. 
This level of inspection is made from within touching distance unless otherwise specified. A mirror may 
be necessary to enhance visual access to all exposed surfaces in the inspection area. This level of 
inspection is made under normally available lighting conditions such as daylight, hangar lighting, 
flashlight, or droplight. A visual inspection may require the removal or opening of access panels or 
doors. Stands, ladders, or platforms may be required to gain proximity to the area being checked. 
The inspection criteria provided below is intended as general guidance. Conduct special inspection as 
deemed appropriate by each operator based on aircraft experience. Any discrepancies found should 
be repaired. 
6.2 Wiring 
The inspection criteria provided below is intended as general guidance. Special inspection should be 
conducted as deemed appropriate by each operator. My discrepancies found should be repaired. 
a. Wire/Wire Bundle — Inspect for: 
• 
Aluminum drill shavings, lint or dust on or inside wire bundles. Aluminum shavings can, 
with vibration or other motion, cut through wire insulation and provide a conductive path 
between wires in a bundle or to adjacent grounded structure. Lint and dust can 
accumulate on wire bundles and may, if subjected to overheated wires, ignite or possibly 
feed an electrical fire.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR CONTINUED AIRWORTHINESS 
• 
Wire insulation that has become brittle. Wire may be more susceptible to cracking. 
Damaged insulation and/or exposed conductor material of wires. Cracked, chafed and 
cut insulation can provide a conductive path between wires in a bundle or to adjacent 
grounded structure. 
• 
Pinched wires can occur at wire clamps, connector backshell clamps, excessively tight 
cable ties, etc. 
• 
Inappropriatefimproper wiring repairs such as the use of duct tape, electrical tape, poor 
crimp splices, etc. 
• 
Wire insulation damage due to fluid leaks (i.e. fuel, hydraulic fluid, etc.) 
• 
Separation of electrical wires from hydraulic, fuel and oxygen lines. Ensure a minimum 
of 0.5-inch separation and any wiring routed within 2.0 inches must be clamped to 
provide separation. 
• 
Small bend radii of wire. Wiring subjected to excessively tight bend radii may sustain 
damage to the wire insulation. 
• 
Sagging wire bundles. Ensure bundles are not allowed to droop onto structure, 
components, cables, hoses, other bundles, etc. 
• 
Wire attached to the outside of a wire bundle using plastic ties instead of being installed 
under existing wire clamps. Can cause chafed and cut wire insulation. 
• 
Unsupported wires running into conduit or wire supported in such a way as to pull the 
wire against the side of the conduit entrance instead of into the center. Can cause 
chafed and cut wire insulation. 
• 
Proximity to high temperature equipment. Wiring shall be kept separate from high 
temperature equipment, such as resistors, exhaust stacks, heating ducts and deicers, to 
prevent wire insulation deterioration. 
• 
Wires with different insulation types should not be routed together, where possible. 
Certain wire insulations may be easily abraded by other types of wire insulation. 
b. Wire Harness Clamps — Inspect for: 
• 
Condition. Ensure any protective material on the wire clamp (i.e. rubber, plastic, etc.) is 
in serviceable and functional condition. Clamps should be secured to structure and wire 
bundle should be snug in clamp. 
• 
Ensure clamps are not installed over splices. 
c. Connectors — Inspect for: 
• 
Condition. Make sure connectors are free of corrosion, moisture, dust and metal 
shavings. Check for wom environmental seals, loose contact tension, proper contact 
locking, missing seal plugs, missing dummy contacts, etc. Drip loops should be 
maintained when connectors are below the level of the hamess and tight bends at 
connectors should be avoided or corrected. 
d. Backshells — Inspect for: 
• 
Condition: Wires may break at connector backshells due to excessive flexing, lack of 
strain relief or improper buildup. Loss of backshell bonding may also occur due to these 
and other factors.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR CONTINUED AIRWORTHINESS 
e. Electrical Conduits and Sleeving — Inspect for: 
• 
Susceptibility to water/moisture entrance: Conduits should not be susceptible to the 
entrance of moisture. If moisture going into conduits and sleeving is unavoidable, 
provisions should be made in the lower portions of the conduit to drain any moisture and 
prevent accumulation. 
• 
Condition: Damage to sleeving and conduits, if not corrected, will often lead to wire 
damage. Make sure components are free from corrosion, moisture, dust, and metal 
shavings. Check that conduit is secured to structure. 
f. Terminations — Inspect for: 
• 
Condition: Terminal lugs and splices are susceptible to mechanical damage, corrosion, 
heat damage and chemical contamination. The buildup and nut torque on wire lugs is 
critical to their performance. 
Grounding Points — Inspect for: 
• 
Condition: Grounding points should be checked for security (i.e. tightness) condition of 
termination, cleanliness and corrosion. Any grounding points that have corroded or have 
lost their protective coating should be repaired and checked for proper resistance. 
CAUTION 
Use care when disturbing or removing wire harness/bundles to minimize the possibility of wire 
insulation damage or cracking. Care must be especially used in areas with severe moisture problems. 
During any repair, modification, or installation work in close proximity to wire bundles, mounts, 
connectors and systems, ensure that these areas are protected from and/or cleaned of metal shavings 
and debris.

1. INTRODUCTION 
The purpose of this report is to demonstrate the structural substantiation to 
applicable 14 CFR Part 25 regulations as they relate to the installation and 
modification of various interior cabinets on Beechcraft Model 400A, S/N's RK-
244 and RK-305, for a FAA Form 337 major alteration, performed by Constant 
Aviation at their Cleveland, OH facility. 
The installations consist of the replacement of new RH and LH forward galleys, 
and modification to the existing closet frame, an extension of the aft lavatory, 
and a modification to the side-facing divan with the manufacturer's approval. 
Everything except the new LH forward galley has been accomplished on a 
previous modification as documented in LPESI Report 222-ST-001. Therefore, 
only the new galley will be discussed and analyzed in this report. The floorplan 
for the two (2) Beechcraft Model 400A aircraft is as shown below.

4.1 General 
The modification of the Model 400A aircraft consists of replacing the existing 
RH and LH forward cabinets with new assemblies, modifying the RH forward 3-
place side-facing divan by refurbing the divan, and modifying the existing LH 
aft lavatory cabinet by extending its cabinet structure to close out the area 
around it. All but the new LH galley are previously installed and certified on 
previous 400A aircraft, and analyzed in LPESI Report 222-ST-001. 
4.2 RH Forward Galley Assy & Instl 
The NXT0313-01 RH forward galley assembly (installed per NXT0313-02) is 
the same as that previously installed on other Model 400A aircraft. An 
illustration of the galley in Figure 4-1.

Figure 4-1 - RH Forward GalleyAssy 
(Contact Pad on Upper Area Not Shown) 
The galley is manufactured from strong lightweight 0.50-inch thick ATR-FP-
501F2 Nomex/fiberglass composite panels from AAR Composites, and 
fabricated using ATR panel pin construction. 
The RH forward galley is installed between the existing RH forward structural 
partition (which separates the flight deck with the cabin) forward of it and the 
3-place side-facing divan immediately aft of it. The lower wider section of the 
cabinet also encloses the aircraft's air conditioning evaporator mounted 
separately to the floor structure underneath. 
4.3 RH Forward Divan Modification 
The NXT0313-03 3-place side-facing divan assembly consists of new drawer and 
fascia door panels onto the existing structural divan frame (Aviation Fabricators 
D-10666 STC'd Installation Kit - STC ST01572WI). It has also been installed in 
previous Model 400A aircraft, and analyzed in LPESI Report 222-ST-001. An 
illustration of the divan assembly is provided in Figure 4-2.

Figure 4-2 — RH Forward Divan Mod 
The divan closeout panels are manufactured from strong lightweight 0.50-
inch thick ATR-FP-501F2 Nomex/fiberglass composite panels from AAR 
Composites, and fabricated using ATR panel pin construction. 
The STC'd divan frame installation consists of a structural frame (bottom 
only - no seat backs, cushions form the divan backs), restraint systems 
consisting of lap belts and shoulder harnesses for all three (3) seated 
positions, and a D-106699 floorboard modification installation underneath 
the divan. The frame installed in eight (8) places into the existing cabinet 
"Brownline" seat track extrusions (inboard and outboard). 
4.4 LH Forward Galley Assy & instl 
The NXT0213-01 LH forward galley assembly is a traditional aircraft galley 
and is located between the flight deck and the entry door, directly aft of the 
existing LH forward structural partition (bulkhead). The new galley 
replaces an existing galley of similar design and the same size. In fact, this 
new galley assembly is the same as previously installed in other Model 
400A aircraft, and analyzed in LPESI Report 222-ST-001, except for a 
minor change to the upper forward portion of the cabinet. As can be seen 
in a comparison of the galley illustrations below and Fig. 4-3 of 222-ST-
001, the change consists of eliminating the small recessed condiment tray 
drawer and extending (down) the existing compartment to compensate. 
The galley is manufactured from strong lightweight 0.50-inch thick ATR-FP-
501F2 Nomex/fiberglass composite panels from AAR Composites, and 
fabricated using ATR panel pin construction. 
An illustration of the LH forward galley is provided in Figure 4-3.

Figure 4-3 - LH Forward Galley Assy 
The LH forward galley is installed per NXT0213-02 and is installed utilizing 
the same existing installation attachments - five (5) screw/insert 
attachments into the existing partition and four (4) floor attachments (2 
into the existing seat track and 2 into existing floorboard mounts, and is 
the same as the previous NXT0313-05 installation analyzed in LPESI Report 
222-ST-001. 
The empty cabinet weights 86.15 pounds (less than the 90.61 pound galley 
analyzed in LPESI Report 222-ST-001) and the total placarded content 
weight (Ref. NXT0213-05) of 141.0 pounds (only 1.0 pound more than the 
222-ST-001 analyzed galley). Therefore, the total installation weight of the 
NXT0213-02 galley is 3.46 pounds lighter than that analyzed in LPESI 
Report 222-ST-001, and is therefore structurally substantiated by 
comparison.

4.5 LH Aft Lavatory Extension 
The NXT0313-07 LH aft lavatory modification consists of augmenting the 
toilet cabinet with new panels and compartments between the existing 
cabinet and the RH aft partition. An illustration of the modification to 
the aft lavatory is shown in Figure 4-4 (new components in gray).

This is the same as previously analyzed in LPESI Report 222-ST-001. 
5. STRUCTURAL SUBSTANTIATION 
The structural analysis will be generated using traditional means based on 
conservative assumptions. 
In determining the Margin of Safety (MS), the resulting analytical result will be 
subtracted from 1.0 so that any MS greater than 0.0 is considered a positive 
margin. Also, MS's greater than 3.0 will be listed as "+Ample". 
5.1 LH Forward Galley Assy & Instl 
The critical loadings for the LH forward galley are the 9.0g forward and 3.5g 
side load conditions. However, since the new galley weighs 3.5 pounds less 
than the previously analyzed galley, is of similar shape and design, includes 
that same installed equipment, and utilizing the same aircraft attachment 
points, the new galley assembly and installation is therefore structural 
substantiated by comparison.

The largest placarded drawer is the top, center drawer in the lower section of 
the galley, which is placarded for 45.0 pounds. The drawer is restrained by a 
standard Actron paddle latch, P/N A23511-1S. The applied load to the latch is 
(the drawer itself + hardware is 5.0 pounds): 
Applied Load = (5.0 lbs + 45.0 Ibs) x 3.5g x 1.15ff = 201.3 pounds 
The minimum load rating for the A23511 paddle latch by its manufacturer is 
225.0 pounds. The resulting margin of safety is: 
M.S. = 225.0 lbs / 201.3 Ibs) - 1.0 = +0.12 
6. CONCLUSION 
Based on the above structural analysis, the new cabinets and modification and 
their installations, listed in Sect. 2.1, into the aircraft have been shown to be 
compliant with the applicable 14 CFR Part 25 regulations, as defined in Sect. 3 
with positive margins of safety.

INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS AND OVERHAUL SCHEDULE 
1. To comply with14 CFR 25.1529, continue the new divan assembly (with restraint 
system) on the same inspection and maintenance schedule used per the Hawker 
Beechcraft Maintenance Manual for cabin section inspections. 
a. The new cabin configuration components require no service other than inspection 
at normal inspection interval of 200 hours. 
b. The safety belts require no service other than inspection at normal inspection 
interval of every 200 hours. 
c. Perform a detailed visual inspection of each passenger seat bottom and back 
cushions and covering of all cabin interior components to detect apparent or 
obvious defects or irregularities. 
On the cushion assembly, check for cracks and punctures within a 4" diameter 
circle. The cushion assembly can have no more than three defects found within 
the 4" diameter circle. If a cushion develops a "lump", check to see if there are no 
more than two lumps within a 4" diameter circle. Any damage to the cushions 
outside of the described limits will require them to be replaced. 
Visually inspect the covering assemblies for holes, punctures, and tears. If the 
damage to the covering is holes smaller than 1/2 " in diameter or a cut at a maximum 
of 2" in length then the covering is satisfactory. The sewing of the cover 
assemblies is not to exceed 1" tearing. Any damage to the covering assemblies 
outside of the described limits will require them to be replaced. 
d. Visually inspect the divan and seat assembly tubes and diaphragm for cracks and 
deformation. Damaged conditions could be detected as a crack at the edge of the 
tube or along the length of the tubes or as a crack, tear or cut found on the seat 
bottom or back diaphragm. Visually inspect all hardware for excessive wear 
before and after installation. 
Replace the seat back and bottom diaphragm if two cracks or deformations are 
found with a 4" diameter circle. If a tear or cut is found with a maximum of 6", 
replace the diaphragm. 
There shall be no broken tubes. There shall be no sharp corners, edges, or 
protrusions that may Injure passengers. Replace the tubes if they are bent in such 
a way that they are more than 2" off center. Replace the seat tubes if crack length 
is found to be .125" or greater. Replace the tube if a dent is found running longer 
than 3". Replace the seat tubes if deformation is greater than .25" the overall 
thickness of the tube diameter. 
Cracked or broken fasteners or fittings are to be replaced with new immediately.

FIRST AMENDMENT TO 
AIRCRAFT SECURITY AGREEMENT (SIN RK-244) 
THIS FIRST AMENDMENT TO AIRCRAFT SECURITY AGREEMENT (S/N RK-244) (this "Amendment")
is made as of January 10, 2013, by and between FLIGHT OPTIONS, LLC, a Delaware limited liability 
company ("Borrower") and THE PRUDENTIAL INSURANCE COMPANY OF AMERICA, as collateral agent 
("Agent") for the Lenders (as defined in the Security Agreement defined below). 
RECITALS 
A. 
Borrower has executed an Aircraft Security Agreement (S/N RK-244) dated as of November 16, 
2011 (as amended and assigned from time to time, the "Security Agreement"), in favor of Agent as more fully 
described on Exhibit A attached hereto and made a part hereof. Pursuant to the Security Agreement, 
Borrower has granted Agent for the benefit of Lenders a first priority security interest, security assignment and 
lien, in, against, under and with respect to all of Borrower's right, title and interest in, to and under certain 
collateral, including, without limitation, a Raytheon Aircraft Company model 400A aircraft bearing 
manufacturers serial number RK-244 and U.S. Registration No. N493LX, as more fully described on Exhibit A 
hereto (the "Aircraft").
B. 
Borrower and Agent have agreed to modify certain provisions of the Security Agreement. 
C. 
All capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to 
them in the Security Agreement. 
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and other good and valuable consideration, the 
receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows: 
1. 
Security Agreement Amendments. From and after the date of this Amendment: 
(a) 
The Security Agreement is hereby amended by deleting Section 2.4(i) in its entirety and 
replacing it with the following: 
"(i) Borrower may sell the Aircraft at any time after the Lien in the Aircraft has 
been released in accordance with Section 3.5 hereof; and" 
(b) 
The Security Agreement is hereby amended by deleting Section 3.5 thereof in its entirety 
and replacing it with the following: 
"3.5 Release of Lien. Upon receipt by Lenders on or before the date set forth 
on Annex H hereto of the Release Payment (to be allocated among Lenders based on 
their respective pro rata share of the Obligations) in immediately available funds, 
together with interest thereon through such date, if applicable, so long as no Default or 
Event of Default then exists, Lenders shall release the aircraft identified on such Annex 
corresponding to such Release Payment from the Lien of the applicable security 
agreement in favor of Lender. For purposes hereof "Release Payment" means, for 
any Aircraft or group of Aircraft, the payment specified by reference to Annex H hereto. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent at any time that the Release Payment 
exceeds the aggregate unpaid Obligations, then the aggregate Release Payment for 
any and all remaining aircraft indicated on Annex H at such time shall equal the 
aggregate unpaid Obligations.' 
(c) 
The Security Agreement is hereby amended by deleting Annex D to the Security Agreement 
in its entirety and replacing it with Annex D in the form set forth on Exhibit B attached hereto and made a part 
hereof.

remedies under the Loan Documents; (d) the payment and performance of the Obligations are, and shall, in 
accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents, continue to be, secured by, among other things, the

has a first priority perfected security interest in, and lien on, the Financed Aircraft, the Additional Aircraft and 
the other collateral described in the Loan Documents; (f) the aircraft described in Exhibit B hereto are the

warranties shall prove to be false, incorrect or misleading in any material respect, Agent or either Lender may, 
in its absolute and sole discretion, declare that a default has occurred and exists under the Loan Documents, 
and Agent and Lenders shall be entitled to all of the rights and remedies set forth in the Loan Documents as 
the result of the occurrence of such default.

and shall not affect any other provision hereof, and the remaining provisions shall remain operative and in full 
force and effect.

of payment to Agent (collectively, the "Sale Payment"), first, to be applied to the payment in whole or in 
part of the Obligations in such order and manner as Agent may elect, and second, any excess remaining 
after such application, to be disbursed to Borrower; and (y) if the unpaid principal balance of any of the 
Notes is reduced by such Minimum Payment, the principal installments set forth in Exhibit A to such Note 
shall be deemed amended from and after the payment date immediately following the sale date to reflect 
the amortization of the then unpaid principal balance of such Note over the remaining payment dates as 
determined by Agent in its sole discretion; and 
(ii) 
Borrower may charter the Aircraft to any customer of Borrower from time to time, in each case,

than $200,000.00 in the aggregate, to Borrower (and such amounts shall be applied by Borrower to pay 
the costs of such repairs). Borrower shall consult with Agent prior to agreeing to any settlement or 
adjustment of any claim in respect of damage, repair or other loss to the Aircraft, including, without 
limitation, the Airframe, Engines and any Part, where the cost of replacement or fair market value of the 
damage, repair or other loss to the Aircraft, including, without limitation, the Airframe, Engines and any 
Part, is in excess of $200,000.00. 
(c) All of the coverages required herein shall be in full force and effect worldwide throughout 
any geographical areas to, in or over which the Aircraft is operated. Borrower shall not self-insure (by 
deductible, premium adjustment, or risk retention arrangement of any kind) the insurance required to be 
maintained hereunder. All insurance proceeds payable under the requisite policies shall be payable in U.S. 
Dollars. Borrower agrees that it shall obtain and maintain such other insurance coverages, or cause 
adjustments to be made to the scope, amount or other aspects of the existing insurance coverages, as 
promptly as practicable upon Agent's request, as and when Agent, in the exercise of its good faith credit 
discretion, deems such additional insurance coverages or modifications to be appropriate in light of any 
changes in Applicable Standards, the insurance market, Borrower's anticipated use of the Aircraft or other 
pertinent circumstances. 
(d) 
Annually on or before the anniversary of the policy expiration date, Borrower shall furnish to 
Agent evidence of insurance coverage in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Agent evidencing 
that Borrower has obtained the insurance coverages required herein for a twelve (12) month or greater period 
commencing from and after such anniversary date, and, if Agent shall so request, a copy of the applicable 
policies. In the event Borrower shall fail to maintain insurance as herein provided, Agent and/or Lenders 
may, at their option, provide such insurance, and Borrower shall, upon demand, reimburse Agent and/or 
Lenders for the cost thereof, together with interest at the highest default rate of interest provided for in the 
Loan Documents from the date of payment through the date of reimbursement. 
2.7 Event of Loss. 
(a) Upon the occurrence of any Event of Loss with respect to the Airframe and/or the Aircraft, 
Borrower shall notify Agent of any such Event of Loss within five (5) Business Days of the date thereof. 
Borrower shall pay Agent, within forty-five (45) days after the occurrence of such Event of Loss, in 
immediately available funds the greater of (i) all insurance proceeds received by Borrower in connection with 
such Event of Loss, and (ii) the Minimum Payment set forth on Annex G hereto corresponding to the month 
in which such payment occurs, together with any principal installment then due and payable under the 
Obligations and all interest accrued on the Obligations through the date of payment to Agent, first, to be 
applied to the payment in whole or in part of the Obligations in such order and manner as Agent may 
elect, and second, any excess remaining after such application, to be disbursed to Borrower; and (y) if the 
unpaid principal balance of any of the Notes is reduced by such Minimum Payment, the principal 
installments set forth in Exhibit A to such Note shall be deemed amended from and after the payment date 
immediately following the sale date to reflect the amortization of the then unpaid principal balance of such 
Note over the remaining payment dates as determined by Agent in its sole discretion. Upon indefeasible 
payment in full of such amounts and so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the

(RK-244 SECURITY AGREEMENT) 
EFTA00012251

EFTA00012252
--- PAGE 143 ---
Aircraft shall be released from the security interest of this Agreement, and Agent shall discharge all 
registrations with the International Registry with respect to the Aircraft. 
(b) Upon an Event of Loss with respect to any Engine or APU under circumstances in which 
there has not occurred an Event of Loss with respect to the Airframe, Borrower shall, within thirty (30) days 
after the occurrence of such Event of Loss, replace such Engine or APU, as applicable, and grant to Agent a 
first priority security interest and security assignment in a similar or better engine or auxiliary power unit, as 
applicable. Such engine or auxiliary power unit, as applicable, shall be of the same make and model 
number as the Engine or APU suffering the Event of Loss and shall be free and clear of all Liens and shall 
have a value, utility and useful life at least equal to, and be in as good an operating condition as, the Engine 
or APU suffering the Event of Loss, assuming such Engine or APU was in the condition and repair required 
by the terms hereof immediately prior to the occurrence of such Event of Loss. Borrower, at its own cost 
and expense, shall fumish Agent with such documents to evidence such conveyance and make such filings 
as Agent shall request to subject such engine or auxiliary power unit, as applicable, to the lien of this 
Agreement. 
Each such replacement engine or auxiliary power unit, as applicable, shall, after such 
conveyance be deemed an "Engine" or "APU" (as defined herein), as applicable, and shall be deemed part 
of the same Aircraft as was the Engine or APU replaced thereby. 
(c) Agent shall be entitled to receive and retain all proceeds payable by any insurer with 
respect to an Event of Loss, by any manufacturer with respect to a Retum to Manufacturer or by any 
governmental authority with respect to any Requisition of Use, as the case may be; provided, however, that 
so long as no Default or Event of Default then exists and Borrower has complied with the provisions of this 
Section 2.7, then Agent shall remit such proceeds to Borrower. 
(d) If the Airframe, any Engine, APU or major Part has suffered any damage requiring the FM 
to be notified of such damage by use of an FAA Form 337 or otherwise, then within ten (10) days of such 
notification to the FM, Borrower shall notify Agent of such damage, and Agent and. Borrower shall consult 
for the purpose of determining the diminished value of the Aircraft resulting from such damage history. The 
diminished value of the Aircraft shall be the amount by which the fair market sales value of the Aircraft 
without such damage history exceeds the fair market sales value of the Aircraft with such damage history. 
For purposes hereof, fair market sales value shall be determined on the following basis: (i) the value shall 
be the amount which would be obtained in an arm's length transaction between an informed and willing 
buyer (who is not a used aircraft dealer), and an informed and willing seller under no compulsion to sell; (ii) 
the costs of removal of the Aircraft from its then location shall not be a deduction from such value; and (iii) in 
determining any such value, it shall be assumed (whether or not the same be true) that the Aircraft has been 
maintained by Borrower and is in the condition in which it is required to be in accordance with this 
Agreement and that the total number of Airframe flight hours (including any component with hourly overhaul 
schedules) accumulated from the Closing Date to the date of such damage do not exceed the product of the 
flight hours limitation set forth in Annex B hereto times the number of twelve month periods and any portion 
thereof from the Closing Date to such date. 
Within ten (10) days after Borrower and Agent agree upon the diminished value of the Aircraft, 
Borrower shall pay Agent the amount of such diminished value, which payment Agent shall apply as a 
partial prepayment of the Obligations without any prepayment penalty. If Borrower and Agent cannot agree 
on the diminished value of the Aircraft within ten (10) days after notification of such damage to the FM, 
then Agent shall appoint an independent appraiser (reasonably acceptable to Borrower) to determine such 
value. Borrower agrees to pay the costs and expenses of any such determination and appraisal. The 
independent appraiser shall be required to complete such determination as promptly as practicable, but in 
any event, not later than forty (40) days after the date on which it is appointed. A final determination by the 
independent appraiser regarding the extent of any diminished value of the Aircraft shall be binding on 
Borrower and Agent. Within ten (10) days after the independent appraiser's determination of the diminished 
value of the Aircraft, Borrower shall pay Agent the amount of such diminished value, which payment 
Lenders shall apply as a partial prepayment of the Obligations without any prepayment penalty.

3.1 Grant of Security Interest. As collateral security for the prompt and complete payment and 
performance as and when due of all of the Obligations and in order to induce Lenders to amend the 
Existing Documents, Borrower hereby grants, pledges and assigns to Agent (for the benefit of Lenders) a 
first priority security interest, security assignment and Lien, in, against, under and with respect to all of 
Borrower's right, title and interest in, to and under all of the following collateral, whether now existing or 
hereafter acquired (collectively, the "Collateral"): (i) the Aircraft, including the Airframe, each of the 
Engines, the API) and the Records; (ii) the Parts; (iii) any and all present and future Third Party 
Agreements; (iv) any and all other associated rights secured by or associated with the Airframe and/or the 
Engines, together with any related international interests; and (v) all proceeds of the foregoing. The 
foregoing shall not be deemed in any way whatsoever as an agreement by Agent or Lenders to permit or 
allow Borrower to enter into any Third Party Agreements, and Borrower shall only be allowed to enter into 
any of the foregoing in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the 
contrary contained herein or otherwise, neither Agent nor either Lender assumes, by virtue of this 
Agreement or otherwise, any obligations, liabilities and/or duties of any kind whatsoever of Borrower 
(and/or of any other Person) under, or with respect to, the Collateral, and neither Agent nor either Lender 
shall be responsible in any way whatsoever for the performance of any obligations, liabilities and/or duties 
of any kind whatsoever by Borrower (and/or by any other Person) in connection with, relating to, or arising 
under, the Collateral. 
3.2 Agent Appointed as Attorney-in-Fact. Borrower hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints 
Agent and any employee, officer or agent thereof, with full power of substitution, as its true and lawful 
attorney-in-fact with full power and authority in the place and stead of Borrower and in the name of 
Borrower or in its own name, from time to time in Agent's sole discretion, for the purpose of carrying out 
the terms of this Agreement, and Borrower hereby further irrevocably authorizes Agent and any employee, 
officer or agent thereof to take any and all appropriate action and to make, execute, deliver, file and/or record 
any and all instruments or documents (including, without limitation, any FAA filings, UCC financing 
statements or UCC amendments or any control agreements) and to make, cause to be made and/or consent 
to all registrations with the International Registry that may be necessary or desirable to accomplish the 
purposes of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents. This appointment is coupled with an 
interest, is irrevocable and shall terminate only upon indefeasible payment and performance in full of all of 
the Obligations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Borrower hereby further agrees that (i) 
Agent shall have authority, during the continuance of an Event of Default, to endorse Borrowers name on 
any checks, notes, drafts or any other payments or instruments relating to the Collateral and constituting 
Collateral that come into Agent's or either Lenders possession or control and to settle, adjust, receive 
payment and make claim or proof of loss and (ii) Borrower shall not file or record any corrective or 
termination statements with respect to any UCC financing statements, amendments or assignments or 
control agreements filed or recorded by or for the benefit of Agent with respect to any of the Collateral and 
shall not discharge or allow to be discharged any international interest or other Registerable Interest created 
in favor of Agent hereunder or under the Loan Documents prior to the indefeasible payment in full of the 
Obligations and termination of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. The powers conferred on 
Agent hereunder are solely to protect its interest in the Collateral and shall not impose any duty upon it to 
exercise any such powers. Agent shall be accountable only for amounts that it actually receives as a result of 
the exercise of such powers, and neither it nor any of its officers, directors, employees or agents shall be 
responsible to Borrower for any act or failure to act. 
3.3 Consent to Registration of International Interest. 
Borrower hereby (a) consents to the 
registration of any international interest or other Registerable Interest arising in connection with this 
Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents and any subordination, amendment, discharge or undertaking 
permitted by the Cape Town Convention with respect thereto, and (b) authorizes its professional user entity 
to consent to such registration (including all final consents thereto), upon request therefor by Agent. At 
closing, Borrower hereby agrees to further authorize its professional user entity to consent to any and all 
such registrations.

3.4 Inspection. Agent or its authorized representatives shall have the right, but not the duty, to 
inspect the Aircraft, any part thereof and/or the Records, at any reasonable time and from time to time, 
wherever located, upon reasonable prior written notice to Borrower, except that no advance notice shall be 
necessary prior to any inspection conducted, and such inspection may be conducted at any time, after the 
occurrence of an Event of Default. Upon request of Agent, Borrower shall promptly provide Agent with 
notice of the location of the Aircraft and with all Records. 
Borrower shall be responsible for the 
reasonable cost of any inspection conducted after the occurrence of an Event of Default and shall pay 
Agent such amount promptly upon demand. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if no Default 
or Event of Default shall then exist, Agent shall be permitted to conduct not more than two (2) such 
inspections during any fiscal year of Borrower. 
3.5 Release of Lien. 
So long as no Default or Event of Default then exists or would result 
therefrom, Agent hereby agrees to release the Aircraft and other Collateral from the Lien of this 
Agreement upon the payment of the Sale Payment in connection with the sale of the Aircraft pursuant to 
Section 2.4 above. 
SECTION 4. Events of Default. The term "Event of Default", wherever used herein, shall mean: 
(a) Borrower shall fail to pay any Obligation within five (5) Business Days after the same shall 
become due and payable (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration, upon demand or otherwise); or 
(b) 
Borrower shall default in the payment or performance of any indebtedness, liability or 
obligation to (i) Agent or either Lender or any Affiliate of either Lender, the amount of which, whether

(e) 
Borrower shall (except as expressly permitted by the provisions of this Agreement) sell, assign,

or with respect to, the Aircraft, any part thereof or any of the other Collateral, or Borrowers interest 
therein, or attempt or offer to do any of the foregoing, or permit the same to occur; or 
(f) 
Borrower shall fail to perform or observe any agreement (other than those specifically referred 
to in this Section 4) required to be performed or observed by it under this Agreement or in any of the other 
Loan Documents, and such failure shall continue uncured for thirty (30) days after written notice thereof 
from Agent to Borrower (but such notice and cure period will not be applicable unless such breach is 
curable by practical means within such notice period); or 
(g) any representation or warranty made by Borrower in this Agreement or in any of the other 
Loan Documents or in any agreement, document or certificate delivered by Borrower in connection

days after the filing date; or

(I) 
this Agreement shall cease to be in full force and effect or shall cease to give Agent the rights 
and interests purported to be created hereunder, including, without limitation, the failure of the interests 
granted hereunder to constitute a registered international interest in the Collateral subject to the Cape 
Town Convention (other than as a result of any failure in filing or otherwise on the part of Agent or its 
agents); or 
(m) a Default or an Event of Default (as such terms are defined therein) shall occur under any of 
the other Loan Documents. 
SECTION 5. 
Remedies.
5.1 
Remedies. If an Event of Default occurs, in addition to all other rights and remedies 
granted to it in this Agreement and in the other Loan Documents, Agent may exercise all rights and 
remedies of a secured party under the UCC or of a creditor, including a security assignee, under the 
Cape Town Convention (including without limitation, the remedies contemplated by Article 13 of the 
Convention and/or Article IX of the Protocol) or under any other Applicable Law. Without limiting the 
generality of the foregoing, Borrower agrees that upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, Agent, 
without demand or notice of any kind (except the notice specified below of time and place of public or 
private sale) to or upon Borrower or any other Person (all and each of which demands and/or notices are 
hereby expressly waived), in Agent's sole discretion, may exercise any one or more of the following 
remedies: (i) proceed at law or in equity, to enforce specifically Borrower's performance or to recover 
damages; (ii) terminate the right of any third party to use, possess or control the Aircraft; (iii) to the extent 
permitted by Applicable Law, enter the premises where the Aircraft is located and take immediate 
possession of and remove (or disable in place) the Aircraft (and/or any Engines, APU and/or Parts then 
unattached to the Aircraft) by self-help, summary proceedings or otherwise without liability if conducted in 
accordance with Applicable Law; (iv) use Borrower's premises for storage without liability, except for its 
own gross negligence or willful misconduct; (v) preserve the Airframe, Engines, APU and/or Parts, and 
their respective value (but without any obligation to do so), immobilize or keep idle the Airframe and/or 
any Engine, APU or Part, manage, sell, lease, assign or otherwise dispose of the Airframe and/or any 
2394767 
(RK-244 SECURITY AGREEMENT) 
EFTA00012259
--- PAGE 150 ---
EFTA00012260
--- PAGE 151 ---
Engine, APU or Part or any of the other Collateral, whether or not in Agent's possession, in one or more 
parcels, at public or private sale or sales, with no less than ten (10) working days' prior notice to Borrower 
of any proposed sale or lease of the Airframe or any Engine, which Borrower acknowledges as 
constituting "reasonable prior notice" for the purposes of the Cape Town Convention, at such prices as 
Agent may deem best; (vi) apply any deposit, other cash collateral, or collect and apply proceeds to 
reduce any amounts due to Agent and/or Lenders; (vii) terminate any Third Party Agreement, without 
regard as to the existence of any event of default thereunder and recover, or cause Borrower and any 
party to any Third Party Agreement and any Person taking by or through any of them to relinquish 
possession and return the Aircraft, including the Engines, APU and Parts, pursuant to this Section 5, 
and/or exercise any and all other remedies under any Third Party Agreements, or in Borrower's stead, to 
the extent provided for under, or otherwise available to Borrower in connection with any Third Party 
Agreement; (viii) collect, receive, appropriate and realize upon the Collateral, or any part thereof; (ix) 
demand and obtain from any court speedy relief pending final determination available at law (including, 
without limitation, possession, control, custody or immobilization of the Aircraft or preservation of the 
Aircraft or its fair market value); (x) procure the deregistration (whether by utilizing the IDERA or 
otherwise) and/or export and physical transfer of the Aircraft from the territory in which it is then situated; 
and (xi) exercise any and all other remedies allowed by Applicable Law, including, without limitation, the 
Cape Town Convention and the UCC. Agent or either Lender shall have the right upon any such public 
sale or sales, and, to the extent permitted by law, upon any such private sale or sales, to purchase the 
whole or any part of the Collateral so sold, free of any right or equity of redemption in Borrower, which 
right or equity of redemption is hereby expressly released. Borrower further agrees, at Agent's request, 
to assemble the Collateral, make it available to Agent at such places as Agent shall reasonably select, 
whether at Borrower's premises or elsewhere. Agent shall deliver to each Lender its pro rata share of the 
net proceeds of any such realization (after deducting all reasonable costs and expenses of every kind 
incurred in connection therewith) ("Net Proceeds") based on such Lender's pro rata share of the 
Obligations then outstanding first, to be applied to the payment in whole or in part of the Obligations in such 
order and manner as Lenders may elect, and second, any excess remaining after such application, to be 
disbursed to Borrower. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Borrower waives all claims, damages 
and demands against Agent and each Lender arising out of the repossession, retention, sale or other 
disposition of the Collateral, except any claims or damages related to or arising out of the gross 
negligence or willful misconduct of Agent or such Lender and any claims to any excess Net Proceeds 
remaining after the application of any Net Proceeds in accordance with the immediately preceding 
sentence. Borrower agrees that Agent need not give more than ten (10) working days' notice (as 
contemplated under the Cape Town Convention) of the time and place of any public sale or of the time 
after which a private sale may take place and that such notice is reasonable notification of such matters. 
Borrower shall be liable for any deficiency if the proceeds of any sale or disposition of the Collateral are 
insufficient to pay in full the Obligations. 
5.2 
Relief Pending Final Determination. 
Without limiting the generality of Agent's other 
remedies set forth in this Section 5, in the event Agent adduces evidence of an Event of Default by 
Borrower, Agent may, pending final determination of its claim, obtain from a court speedy (as defined in 
Article 20 of the Cape Town Convention) relief in the form of such one or more of the following orders as 
Agent requests: 
(a) 
preservation of the Aircraft and its value; 
(b) 
possession, control or custody of the Aircraft; 
(c) 
immobilization of the Aircraft; 
(d) lease or, except where covered by sub-paragraphs (a) to (c), management of the 
Aircraft and the income therefrom; and 
(e) if at any time Borrower and Agent specifically agree, sale and application of 
proceeds therefrom. 
In furtherance thereof, Agent and Borrower hereby agree to exclude the application of paragraph , 
of Article 20 of the Cape Town Convention. Nothing in this Section 5.2 shall limit the availability to 
Agent of other forms of interim relief.

5.3 
No Waiver: Cumulative Remedies. No right or remedy is exclusive. Borrower hereby 
acknowledges that none of the provisions of this Section 5, including any remedies set forth or referenced 
herein, is 'manifestly unreasonable' for the purposes of the Cape Town Convention. Each may be used 
successively and cumulatively and in addition to any other right or remedy referred to above or otherwise 
available to Agent and/or Lenders at law or in equity, including, such rights and/or remedies as are 
provided for in the UCC and/or the Cape Town Convention, but in no event shall Agent and/or Lenders be 
entitled to recover any amount in excess of the maximum amount recoverable under Applicable Law with 
respect to any Event of Default. No express or implied waiver by Agent and/or Lenders of any Default or 
Event of Default hereunder shall in any way be, or be construed to be, a waiver of any future or 
subsequent Default or Event of Default. The failure or delay of Agent and/or Lenders in exercising any 
rights granted it hereunder upon the occurrence of any of the contingencies set forth herein shall not 
constitute a waiver of any such right upon the continuation or reoccurrence of any such contingencies or 
similar contingencies, and any single or partial exercise of any particular right by Agent and/or Lenders 
shall not exhaust the same or constitute a waiver of any other right provided for or otherwise referred to 
herein. After the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, the acceptance by Agent and/or Lenders 
of any installment of principal and/or interest or of any other sum owing hereunder or under the other 
Loan Documents shall not constitute a waiver of such Default (unless such Default arose from the failure 
to pay such installment and such installment was paid in full) or Event of Default, regardless of Agent's 
and/or either Lender's knowledge or lack of knowledge thereof at the time of acceptance of any such 
payment and shall not constitute a reinstatement of this Agreement if Agent and/or either Lender has sent 
Borrower a notice of default, unless Agent shall have agreed in writing to reinstate this Agreement and 
waive the Default or Event of Default. To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, Borrower waives any 
rights now or hereafter conferred by statute or otherwise that limit or modify any rights or remedies of 
Agent and/or Lenders under this Agreement, including, without limitation, the provisions of Articles 11(2) 
and 13(2) of the Convention and Article IX(6) of the Protocol. 
SECTION 6. 
Miscellaneous.
6.1 Notices. All communications and notices provided for herein shall be in writing and shall be 
deemed to have been duly given or made (I) upon hand delivery, or (ii) upon delivery by an overnight 
delivery service, or (iii) three (3) Business Days after being deposited in the U.S. mail, return receipt 
requested, first class postage prepaid, and addressed to Agent at the address set forth above or to 
Borrower at its address set forth under its signature hereto or such other address as either party may 
hereafter designate by written notice to the other, or (iv) when sent by telecopy (with customary 
confirmation of receipt of such telecopy) on the Business Day when sent or upon the next Business Day if 
sent on other than a Business Day. 
6.2 Expenses and Fees: Indemnity; Performance of Borrower's Obligations. 
(a) Borrower shall pay to Agent and each Lender upon demand all out-of-pocket fees, costs 
and expenses incurred by or on behalf of Agent or such Lender at any time in connection with (i) the 
negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and enforcement of this Agreement and the other Loan 
Documents and the collection of the Obligations, (ii) the creation, preservation and protection of the 
Collateral and the perfection and first priority of Agent's security interest, security assignment and Lien 
thereon, including any discharges and subordinations required to maintain such first priority and to 
remove or discharge any Liens not constituting Permitted Liens, or (iii) Borrower's exercise of any right 
granted under, or any amendment or other modification to any of, the Loan Documents. Such fees, costs 
and expenses shall include, without limitation, appraisal and inspection fees, the fees and expenses of 
FAA Counsel and of Agent's and each Lender's counsel, consultants and brokers, UCC, FAA, International 
Registry and other applicable title, interest and Lien searches, and costs and expenses relating to recovery, 
repossession, storage, insurance, transportation, repair, refurbishment, advertising, sale and other 
disposition of the Aircraft. Borrower shall also pay all fees (including license, filing and registration fees), 
taxes, assessments and other charges of whatever kind or nature that may be payable or determined to 
be payable in connection with the execution, delivery, recording or performance of this Agreement or any 
of the other Loan Documents or any modification thereof.

(b) Borrower hereby further agrees to pay, indemnify, and hold Agent and each Lender and 
their respective Affiliates and all of Agent's and each Lender's and such Affiliates' respective directors, 
shareholders, officers, employees, agents, predecessors, attorneys-in-fact, lawyers, successors and 
assigns (Agent, each Lender, their respective Affiliates and all of such other parties and entities 
sometimes hereinafter collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") harmless, on a net after-tax basis, from and 
against any and all other liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, out-of 
pocket costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever arising with respect to or in 
connection with the Loan Documents or the Collateral, including, without limitation, the ownership, lease, 
possession, use, sale or other disposition of the Aircraft and the other Collateral or the execution, delivery, 
enforcement, performance or administration of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents (the 
foregoing being referred to as the "indemnified liabilities"), provided, that Borrower shall have no obligations 
thereunder with respect to indemnified liabilities arising from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of 
Agent or such Lender, as applicable. 
(c) If Borrower fails to perform or comply with any of its agreements contained herein or in 
the other Loan Documents, including, without limitation, its obligations to keep the Aircraft free and clear 
of Liens, to comply with Applicable Standards or to obtain the requisite insurance coverages, Agent and/or 
either Lender shall have the right, but shall not be obligated, to effect such performance or compliance, 
with such agreement. Any expenses of Agent and/or either Lender incurred in connection with effecting 
such performance or compliance, together with interest thereon at the highest default rate of interest 
provided for in the Loan Documents from the date incurred until reimbursed, shall be payable by Borrower 
to Agent and/or such Lender promptly on demand and until such payment shall constitute part of the 
Obligations secured hereby. Any such action shall not be a cure or waiver of any Default or Event of 
Default hereunder 
(d) 
Without waiving any other rights or remedies of Agent, due to the often time intensive 
nature of reviewing complex reorganizations, if Borrower requests Agent's consent to the corporate or 
other entity reorganization of Borrower or any Affiliate of Borrower, Agent may require, at its option, a Two 
Thousand Dollar ($2,000.00) review fee; plus Agent may, at Borrower's expense, retain outside counsel 
to aid in review of the reorganization documentation. 
6.3 Entire Agreement; Modifications. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents constitute 
the entire understanding and agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the matters contained herein 
and shall completely and fully supersede all other prior agreements (including any proposal letter, 
commitment letter, and/or term sheet), both written and oral, between Agent and/or either Lender and 
Borrower relating to the Obligations. None of Agent, either Lender nor Borrower shall hereafter have any 
rights under such prior agreements but shall look solely to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents 
for the definition and determination of all of their respective rights, liabilities and responsibilities relating to 
the Obligations. Neither this Agreement, nor any terms hereof, may be changed, waived, discharged or 
terminated orally, but only by an instrument in writing signed by the party against which enforcement of a 
change, waiver, discharge or termination is sought. 
6.4 Construction of this Agreement and Related Matters. All representations and warranties made 
in this Agreement shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement. Borrower's obligations 
contained in Section 6.2 hereof shall survive the payment and performance of the Obligations and the 
termination of this Agreement. This Agreement may be executed by the parties hereto on any number of 
separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an original, but all such 
counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument. The headings of the Sections 
hereof are for convenience only, are not part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to affect the 
meaning or construction of any of the provisions hereof. Time is of the essence in the payment and 
performance of all of Borrowers obligations under this Agreement. Any provision of this Agreement that 
may be determined to be prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be 
ineffective in such jurisdiction to the extent thereof without invalidating the remaining provisions of this 
Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.

6.5 Lender's Assignment. Each Lender, may at any time, with or without notice to Borrower, grant a 
security interest in, sell, assign or otherwise transfer (an "Assignment") all or any part of its interest in this 
Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including all associated rights associated with or secured 
thereby and the related international interests) or any amount due or to become due hereunder or 
thereunder, and Borrower shall perform all of its obligations under the Loan Documents, to the extent so 
transferred, for the benefit of the beneficiary of such Assignment (such beneficiary, including any 
successors and assigns, an "Assignee"); provided that no such Assignment shall be to any Person 
engaged in the operation of a fractional aircraft ownership program. Borrower hereby waives any right to 
assert, and agrees not to assert, against any Assignee any abatement, reduction, defense, setoff, 
recoupment, claim or counterclaim that Borrower may have against Agent or such Lender, other than 
defenses arising from fraudulent acts on the part of Assignee. Upon the express assumption by such 
Assignee of such Lender's obligations hereunder, such Lender shall be relieved of any such assumed 
obligations. Borrower hereby consents to any such assignment, grant, sale or transfer, including, without 
limitation, for purposes of the Cape Town Convention. If so directed in writing, Borrower shall pay all 
amounts due or to become due to the applicable Lender under the Loan Documents and/or any related 
associated rights and international interests directly to Assignee or any other party designated in writing by 
such Lender. Borrower acknowledges and agrees that such Lender's right to enter into an Assignment is 
essential to such Lender and, accordingly, waives any restrictions under Applicable Law with respect to an 
Assignment and any related remedies. Upon the request of such Lender or any Assignee, Borrower also 
agrees (a) to promptly execute and deliver to such Lender or to such Assignee an acknowledgment of 
assignment in form and substance satisfactory to the requesting party, an insurance certificate naming 
Assignee as additional insured and loss payee and otherwise evidencing the insurance coverages required 
hereby, a consent to the Assignment for International Registry purposes, as well as renew any authorization 
required by the International Registry in connection with such consent, such as renewing its transacting user 
entity status and re-designating a professional user entity, if necessary in Agent's or such Lenders 
judgment, and such other documents and assurances reasonably requested by Agent, such Lender or 
Assignee and make, or cause to be made, all registrations (including all assignments and subordinations) 
and all amendments, extensions and discharges with the International Registry reasonably requested by 
Agent, such Lender or Assignee (and give or obtain any necessary consent thereto, as well as renew any 
authorization required by the International Registry in connection therewith, including renewing its 
transacting user entity status and re-designating a professional user entity, if necessary in Agent's and/or 
such Lender's judgment), and (b) to comply with the reasonable requirements of any such Assignee in order 
to perfect such Assignee's Lien in the Airframe, Engines (including all associated rights associated therewith 
or secured thereby and the related international interests), proceeds and other Collateral. 
6.6 
Jurisdiction. Borrower hereby irrevocably consents and agrees that any legal action, suit or 
proceeding arising out of or in any way in connection with this Agreement or any of the other Loan 
Documents may be instituted or brought in the courts of the State of New York or the U.S. District Court 
for the Southern District of New York, as Agent may elect or in any other state or Federal court as Agent 
shall deem appropriate, and by execution and delivery of this Agreement, Borrower hereby irrevocably 
accepts and submits to, for itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, the 
non-exclusive jurisdiction of any such court, and to all proceedings in such courts. Borrower irrevocably 
consents to service of any summons and/or legal process by first class, certified United States air mail, 
postage prepaid, to Borrower at the address set forth below its signature hereto, such method of service 
to constitute, in every respect, sufficient and effective service of process in any such legal action or 
proceeding. Nothing in this Agreement or in any of the other Loan Documents shall affect the right to 
service of process in any other manner permitted by law or limit the right of Agent and/or either Lender to 
bring actions, suits or proceedings in the courts of any other jurisdiction. Borrower further agrees that 
final judgment against it in any such legal action, suit or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be 
enforced in any other jurisdiction, within or outside the United States of America, by suit on the judgment, 
a certified or exemplified copy of which shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and the amount of the 
liability. Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, Agent and Borrower may bring a 
judicial proceeding against the Registrar of the International Registry in the Republic of Ireland, solely 
with respect to matters relating to the International Registry itself.

having jurisdiction conferring on the Mortgagee the right to immediate possession or requiring 
the Grantor to deliver immediate possession of all or part of such Aircraft to the Mortgagee, to 
the entry of which the Grantor hereby specifically consents, or (ii) with or, to the fullest extent

including the Aircraft wherever they may be found and enter any of the premises of or leased by

Mortgage Collateral, including the Aircraft and take possession of and remove the same. The

action; and all such expenses shall constitute Obligations and, until paid, be secured by the lien 
and security interest of this Mortgage and the Security Documents. Upon every such taking of 
possession, the Mortgagee may, from time to time, make all such reasonable expenditures for 
maintenance, insurance, repairs, replacements, alterations, additions and improvements to and of 
the Mortgage Collateral, including the Aircraft as it may deem proper. 
6.3

If an Event of Default under the Credit and Security Agreement shall occur and be 
continuing, the Mortgagee, with or without taking possession of the Mortgage Collateral, 
including the Aircraft, may: 
(i) 
to the extent and in the manner permitted by law, sell at one or more sales, 
all or any part of the Mortgage Collateral, at public or private sale, at such place or places 
and at such time or times and upon such terms, including terms of credit (which may 
include the retention of title by the Mortgagee to the property so sold), as the Mortgagee 
may determine, whether or not the Mortgage Collateral shall be at the place of sale; and 
(ii) 
proceed to protect and enforce its rights under this Mortgage by suit, 
whether for specific performance of any covenant herein contained or in aid of the 
exercise of any power herein granted or for the foreclosure of this Mortgage and the sale 
of the Mortgage Collateral under the judgment or decree of a court of appropriate 
jurisdiction or for the enforcement of any other right. 
(b) 
At any public sale of any Mortgage Collateral, including the Aircraft or any part 
thereof by the Mortgagee pursuant to paragraph (a)(i) above, the Mortgagee may consider and 
accept bids requiring the extension of credit to the bidder and may determine the highest bidder 
at such sale, whether or not the bid of such bidder shall be solely for cash or shall require the 
extension of credit.

any sale under paragraph (a)(i) above by announcement at the time and place appointed for such 
sale or for any adjournment thereof; and without further notice or publication, such sale be made 
at the time and place to which the same shall have been so adjourned. 
(d) 
Upon the completion of any sale under paragraph (a)(i) above, full title and right 
of possession to the Mortgage Collateral, including the Aircraft so sold shall (subject to any 
retention of title by the Mortgagee as part of the terms of such sale) pass to the accepted 
purchaser forthwith upon the completion of such sale, and the Grantor shall deliver, in 
accordance with the instructions of the Mortgagee (including flying any Aircraft or causing the 
same to be flown to such airports in the continental United States as the Mortgagee may specify), 
such Mortgage Collateral so sold. If the Grantor shall for any reason fail to deliver such 
Mortgage Collateral, the Mortgage shall have all of the rights granted by subsection 6.2 hereof. 
The Mortgagee is hereby irrevocably appointed the true and lawful attorney of the Grantor, in its 
name and stead, to make all necessary conveyances of any Mortgage Collateral so sold. 
Nevertheless, if so requested by the Mortgagee or by any purchaser, the Grantor shall confine 
any such sale or conveyance by executing and delivering all proper instruments of conveyance or 
releases as may be designated in any such request. 
6.4 
Waiver of Appraisement. etc. The Grantor agrees, to the fullest extent that it

redemption law now or hereafter in force, in order to prevent or hinder the enforcement of this 
Mortgage or the absolute sale of the Mortgage Collateral. 
6.5 
Remedies Cumulative.

intended to be exclusive of any other remedy, but every such remedy shall be cumulative and 
shall be in addition to every other remedy herein conferred or now or hereafter existing in law. 
6.6 
Application of Proceeds. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be 
continuing, the proceeds of any sale, lease or other disposition of all or any part of the Mortgage 
Collateral pursuant to this Mortgage and all other sums realized or held by the Mortgagee under 
this Mortgage or any proceedings hereunder shall be applied in accordance with the terms of the 
Credit and Security Agreement. 
6.7 
Delay or Omission; Possession of Loan Certificates. 
(a) 
No delay or omission of the Mortgagee to exercise any right or remedy arising 
upon the happening of any Default or Event of Default shall impair any right or remedy or shall 
be construed to be a waiver of any such Default or Event of Default or an acquiescence therein; 
and every right and remedy given to the Mortgagee by this Section 6, the Loan Documents or by 
applicable law may be exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient by 
the Mortgagee. 
(b) 
All rights of action under this Mortgage may be enforced by the Mortgagee 
without the possession of the Notes or any other instrument or document evidencing any 
obligation or the production thereof in any proceeding.

hereunder, ordinary wear and tear excepted, and, in the case of each Aircraft, in such condition 
as may be necessary to enable the airworthiness certification of such Aircraft to be maintained in 
good standing at all times under the Act and to enable such Aircraft at all times to be operated in 
commercial cargo service in the United States; and (iii) maintain all records, logs and other 
materials required by the FAA and any other Governmental Authority having jurisdiction to be 
maintained in respect of such Mortgaged Collateral. The Grantor will comply with all material 
rules and regulations of the FAA. The Grantor agrees that the Airframes, Engines and Parts and 
any other Mortgage Collateral will not be maintained, used or operated: (A) in violation of any 
material law or any rule, regulation or order of any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction 
(domestic or foreign), or in violation of any airworthiness certificate, license or registration 
relating to any Mortgage Collateral issued by any such Governmental Authority, except for any 
violation which, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to result in a 
Material Adverse Effect: (B) in any area excluded from coverage by any insurance required by 
the terms of subsection 4.5 hereof, except in the case of a requisition for use by the United States 
of America, and then only if the Grantor obtains indemnity in lieu of such insurance from the 
United States of America against the risks and in the amounts required by said subsection 4.5 
covering such area, or as to which the Grantor has otherwise obtained the written consent of the 
Mortgagee; or (C) in any recognized or threatened area of hostilities unless fully covered to the 
Mortgagee's satisfaction by war-risk insurance, or unless such Airframe, Engine, Parts or other 
Mortgage Collateral are operated or used under contract with the Government of United States of 
America under which contract said Government assumes liability for any the damage, loss, 
destruction or failure to return possession of such Airframe, Engine, Parts or Mortgage Collateral 
at the end of the term of such contract and for injury to persons or damage to property of others 
or unless the Aircraft is only temporarily located in such area as a result of an isolated 
occurrence attributable to a hijacking, medical emergency, equipment malfunction, weather 
conditions, navigational error or other similar unforeseen circumstances and the Grantor is using 
its good faith efforts to remove the Aircraft from such area. For purposes of this Section 4.1, a 
"material" law, rule, regulation or order of the FAA or any other Governmental Authority having 
jurisdiction (domestic or foreign) is one the violation of which may lead to an enforcement 
action by the FAA or such Governmental Authority or suspension, revocation or limitation of 
Grantor's authority to operate as a Certificated Air Carrier. 
4.2 
Liens. The Grantor will not create or suffer to exist any Lien, International 
Interests or Prospective International Interest upon or with respect to any of the Mortgage 
Collateral, except for Permitted Liens and any other Liens permitted by the terms hereof and of 
the Term Note Agreement. 
4.3 
Taxes. The Grantor will pay, and hereby indemnifies the Mortgagee and each 
Lender from and against, any and all fees and taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges or 
withholdings, together with any penalties, fines or interest thereon (any of the foregoing being 
here called a "Tax") which may from time to time be imposed on or asserted against the 
Mortgagee or any Airframe, Engine or Part or other Mortgage Collateral or any interest therein 
by any Federal, state or local government or other taxing authority in the United States or by any 
foreign government or subdivision thereof or by any foreign taxing authority upon or with

purchase, ownership, mortgaging hereunder, lease, sublease, use, storage, maintenance, sale or 
other disposition of any Airframe, Engine or Part, or any rentals or other earnings payable 
therefor or arising therefrom or the income or other proceeds received with respect thereto, or 
(iii) this Mortgage; provided, however, that, nothing in this subsection 4.3 shall require the 
payment of any Tax unless proceedings shall have been commenced to foreclose any Lien which 
may have attached as security for such Tax, so long as the validity thereof shall be contested in 
good faith by appropriate proceedings and that Grantor shall have set aside and maintain on its 
hooks adequate reserves with respect thereto.

Possession. 
The Grantor will not, without the prior written consent of the 
Mortgagee, except as permitted under the Term Note Agreement, lease or otherwise in any

payments received by the Mortgagee (or Lender) or any Grantor with respect to the Mortgage 
Collateral shall be (if received by the Grantor, immediately paid to the Mortgagee (or Lender)) 
held and applied by the Mortgagee (or Lender) against the Obligations as provided under the 
Term Note Agreement, or be retained by the Grantor for application to the repair of the damage 
to the Aircraft, Airframe, Engine, or Part for which such insurance was paid, all in accordance 
with the terms of the Term Note Agreement. 
4.6 
Modification and Additions. 
The Grantor, at its expense, shall make such 
modifications in and additions to the Airframes and the Engines as may be required from time to 
time to meet the standards of the FAA or other Governmental Authority having jurisdiction. In 
addition, so long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the 
Grantor, at its expense, may from time to time make such modifications in and additions to any 
Airframe or Engine as it may deem desirable in the proper conduct of its business, provided that 
no such modification or addition shall diminish the value or utility of such Airframe or Engine or 
impair the airworthiness or operating condition thereof below the value, utility, airworthiness and 
condition thereof immediately prior to such modification or addition (assuming such Airframe or 
Engine was of the value and utility and in the condition required by the terms of this Mortgage 
immediately prior to such modification or addition) and any expenses incurred or related thereto

Event of Loss with Respect to an Engine. Upon the occurrence of an Event of 
Loss with respect to an Engine under circumstances in which there has not occurred an Event of 
Loss with respect to the Airframe on which such Engine was originally installed, the Grantor 
shall give the Mortgagee prompt written notice thereof and shall, within 90 days after the 
occurrence of such Event of Loss, duly subject to the lien and security interest of this Mortgage, 
in substitution for the Engine with respect to which such Event of Loss occurred, substitute 
another General Electric CF6-50C2 engine (or engine of the same manufacturer of an improved 
model and suitable for installation and use on an Airframe or such other engine acceptable to the 
Mortgagee) (herein called a "Replacement Engine"), free and clear of all Liens and having a

respect to which such Event of Loss occurred assuming such Engine was of the value and utility 
and in the condition and repair required by the terms of this Mortgage immediately prior to the 
occurrence of such Event of Loss. At the time of such replacement, the Grantor, at its expense, 
shall (i) furnish the Mortgagee with evidence, reasonably satisfactory to the Mortgagee, of the 
Grantor's title to the Replacement Engine, (ii) cause a supplement to this Mortgage describing 
the Replacement Engine to be duly executed and filed for recordation pursuant to the Act, (iii)

Replacement Engine, the Grantor's title to the Replacement Engine free and clear of all Liens 
(other than Permitted Liens) and the subjection of the Replacement Engine to the lien and 
security interest of this Mortgage. Upon full compliance by the Grantor with the provisions of 
this subsection 4.11, the Mortgagee will deliver to the Grantor an instrument releasing the 
Engine with respect to which such Event of Loss occurred from the lien and security interest of 
this Mortgage. For all purposes of this Mortgage, each Replacement Engine shall, after being 
subjected to the lien and security interest hereof, be deemed an "Engine" as defined herein and 
shall be deemed part of the same Aircraft as was the Engine replaced thereby.

including the Aircraft as it may deem proper. 
6.3 
Sale and Suits for Enforcement. Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor

retention of title by the Mortgagee to the property so sold), as the Mortgagee may determine, 
whether or not the Mortgage Collateral shall be at the place of sale; and 
(ii) 
proceed to protect and enforce its rights under this Mortgage by suit, 
whether for specific performance of any covenant herein contained or in aid of the exercise of 
any power herein granted or for the foreclosure of this Mortgage and the sale of the Mortgage

extension of credit. 
(e) 
The Mortgagee, to the extent permitted by law, may from time to time adjourn 
any sale under paragraph (a)(i) above by announcement at the time and place appointed for such 
sale or for any adjournment thereof; and without further notice or publication, such sale be made 
at the time and place to which the same shall have been so adjourned. 
(d) 
Upon the completion of any sale under paragraph (a)(i) above, full title and right 
of possession to the Mortgage Collateral, including the Aircraft so sold shall (subject to any 
retention of title by the Mortgagee as part of the terms of such sale) pass to the accepted 
purchaser forthwith upon the completion of such sale, and the Grantor shall deliver, in 
accordance with the instructions of the Mortgagee (including flying any Aircraft or causing the 
same to be flown to such airports in the continental United States as the Mortgagee may specify), 
such Mortgage Collateral so sold. If the Grantor shall for any reason fail to deliver such 
Mortgage Collateral, the Mortgagee shall have all of the rights granted by subsection 6.2 hereof.

name and stead, to make all necessary conveyances of any Mortgage Collateral so sold.

Delay or Omission; Possession of Loan Certificates. 
(a) 
No delay or omission of the Mortgagee to exercise any right or remedy arising 
upon the happening of any Default or Event of Default shall impair any right or remedy or shall 
be construed to be a waiver of any such Default or Event of Default or an acquiescence therein; 
and every right and remedy given to the Mortgagee by this Section 6, the Loan Documents, or by 
applicable law may be exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient by 
the Mortgagee.

4. Debtor Will Execute and Deliver Documents. Debtor will, at RACC's request, furnish RACC such information 
and execute and deliver to RACC such documents and do all such acts and things as RACC may reasonably 
request as are necessary or appropriate to assist RACC in establishing and maintaining a valid security interest in 
the Collateral and to assure that the Collateral is properly titled and registered and the security interest perfected 
to RACC's reasonable satisfaction. Debtor will pay the cost of filing all appropriate documents in all public offices 
where RACC deems such filings necessary or desirable. 
5. Operation, Maintenance and Repair. Subject to the Goveming Documents, Debtor shall operate, maintain and 
repair the Collateral and retain actual control and possession thereof in accordance with the following provisions: 
5a. Subject to the Governing Documents, Debtor shall have complete use of the Collateral until default, and 
Debtor shall use, operate, maintain and store the Collateral, or any part thereof, properly, carefully and in 
compliance with all applicable statutes, ordinances, regulations, policies of insurance and manufacturers 
recommendation and operating and maintenance manuals. 
5b. Subject to the Governing Documents, Debtor agrees that the Collateral will be operated only by duly 
certificated and qualified pilots and shall maintain U.S. registry and shall be based within the geographical 
boundaries of the United States. 
5c. Subject to the Governing Documents, Debtor shall be responsible for and pay for all expenses of owning and 
operating the Collateral, including but not limited to storage, fuel, lubricants, service, inspections, overhauls, 
replacements, maintenance and repairs, all in compliance with the manufacturers operating and maintenance 
manuals and with FAA rules and regulations. Debtor shall properly maintain all records pertaining to the 
maintenance and operation of the Collateral. 
6. Insurance. Subject to the Governing Documents, Debtor will, at its own expense, keep the Collateral insured at 
all times against loss, damage, theft, and such other casualties as RACC may reasonably require (including hull 
insurance) in such amounts, under such forms of policies, upon such terms, for such periods and with such 
companies or underwriters as RACC may (but has no obligation to) approve. RACC hereby approves the 
insurance provided by RTA pursuant to the Governing Documents. Losses or refunds in all cases shall be 
payable to RACC and Debtor as their interests may appear. In no event shall the amount of such insurance be 
less than the amount of indebtedness due under the Promissory Note. All policies of insurance shall provide for at 
least thirty (30) days prior written notice of cancellation to RACC, and shall contain a breath of warranty 
endorsement in favor of RACC. RACC may obtain such insurance if such insurance is not provided by Debtor. 
Debtor shall furnish to RACC proof satisfactory to RACC of compliance with the provisions of this paragraph. 
RACC, and its assigns, are hereby irrevocably appointed attorney-in-fact for Debtor to endorse for Debtor any 
checks, drafts or other instruments whatsoever payable to Debtor as proceeds or refunds for any such insurance 
and to make claims of loss and to sign proofs of loss against any insurance company and to receive all payments. 
Debtor will pay any deductible portion of such insurance. All risk of loss, damage, destruction or confiscation 
shall at all times be on Debtor. 
7. Debtors Possession. Until default, Debtor may have possession of the Collateral and use it in any lawful 
manner not inconsistent with this Security Agreement. RACC may examine and inspect the Collateral, wherever 
located, at all reasonable times. At its option, but without assuming any obligation to do so, RACC may discharge 
taxes, liens or security interests, or other encumbrances levied or asserted against the Collateral, may place and 
pay for insurance thereon, may order and pay for the repair, maintenance and preservation thereof, and may pay 
any necessary filing or recording fees. Amounts paid by RACC under the preceding sentence shall be added to 
Debtors unpaid balance under the Promissory Note, shall be secured by the Collateral and shall be payable upon 
demand, together with interest at the rate computed as provided in Paragraph 2 of the Promissory Note until paid 
in full. Subject to the Governing Documents, Debtor shall at all times keep the Collateral, and any proceeds

therefrom, separate and distinct from other property of the Debtor and shall keep accurate and complete records 
of the Collateral and any such proceeds. 
8. Default. Upon Default, as defined in the Promissory Note, RACC may require Debtor to assemble the 
Collateral and make it available to RACC at a place to be designated by RACC which is reasonably convenient to 
both parties. The requirements of the Kansas Uniform Commercial Code for reasonable notification to Debtor of 
the time and place of any proposed public sale of the Collateral or of the time after which any private sale or other 
intended disposition is to be made, shall be met if such notice is mailed, postage prepaid, to Debtor's address, as 
shown herein, at least twenty (20) days before the time of the sale or disposition. After deduction of all reasonable 
expenses of retaking, holding, preparing for sale or lease, selling, leasing and the like, together with reasonable 
costs of collection, attorneys' fees and legal expenses of RACC, and after the payment of the principal and 
interest due under the Promissory Note, the balance, if any, of the proceeds of the sale may be applied to the 
payment of any or all other indebtedness of Debtor to RACC, whether due or not, whether direct or indirect, 
absolute or contingent, whether now existing or hereafter arising, and whether owing individually or in connection 
with others not parties hereto, and to the satisfaction of indebtedness secured by any subordinate security interest 
in the Collateral of which RACC has received notice prior to distribution of the proceeds. Debtor shall be liable for 
any deficiency after application of such proceeds, to the extent permitted by law. If after a default by Debtor, the 
Collateral is returned to or recovered by RACC, Debtor agrees RACC may fly or otherwise move the Collateral for 
demonstration and other purposes reasonably related to a proposed public or private sale or other disposition of 
the Collateral. 
9. Sale of Aircraft and/or Related Collateral. In the event the Aircraft and/or related Collateral is sold, RACC 
may declare all indebtedness due under the Promissory Note, as well as any other indebtedness or liability 
of Debtor to RACC, immediately due and payable. 
In addition to the foregoing, RACC may (a) sell, or instruct any agent or broker to sell, all or any part of the 
Collateral, and direct such agent or broker to deliver all proceeds thereof to RACC and apply all proceeds to 
the payment of any or all of the unpaid balance owed pursuant to the provisions contained in this Security 
Agreement, in such order and manner as RACC shall choose, in its discretion, and/or (b) cause title to the 
Collateral to be transferred into the name of RACC or its designee. 
Debtor understands and agrees that any sale by RACC of all or part of the Collateral pursuant to the terms of 
this Security Agreement may be effected by RACC at a time and in a manner which could result in the 
proceeds of such sale being significantly and materially less than might have been received if such sale had 
occurred at a different time or in a different manner, and Debtor hereby releases RACC and its officers and 
representatives from and against any and all obligations and/or liabilities arising out of or related to the 
timing or manner of any such sale. All rights and remedies of RACC provided herein are subject to the 
limitations set forth in the Governing Documents that relate to Debtor's interest in the Collateral. 
10. Waiver of Default. No waiver by RACC of any default shall be effective unless in writing, nor operate as a 
waiver of any other default or of the same default in the future. 
11. Restriction on Transfer or Liens. Debtor will not, without the prior written consent of RACC, sell or otherwise 
transfer or encumber the Collateral, or any interest therein, or offer to do so or, except in accordance with the 
Governing Documents, permanently remove or attempt to permanently remove the Collateral from the United 
States. Debtor will keep the Collateral free from any adverse security interest, lien or encumbrance and will not 
permit the Collateral to be attached or replevied. 
12. Taxes. Debtor will promptly pay, or cause to be paid, when due, all taxes and assessments upon the 
Collateral or upon its use or operation or upon this Security Agreement and the obligations evidenced by the 
Promissory Note. 
13. Change of Address. Debtor will notify RACC in writing of any change of address from that shown in this 
Security Agreement within ten (10) days of such change. 
14. GOVERNING LAW AND CHOICE OF FORUM. THIS SECURITY AGREEMENT WAS MADE AND ENTERED 
INTO IN THE STATE OF KANSAS AND THE LAW GOVERNING THIS TRANSACTION SHALL BE THAT OF 
THE STATE OF KANSAS AS IT MAY FROM TIME TO TIME EXIST. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT ANY LEGAL 
PROCEEDING BASED UPON THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECURITY AGREEMENT SHALL BE BROUGHT

The security interest granted herein is a purchase money security interest under the Kansas Uniform Commercial 
. Code. 
3. Debtor's Warranty of Title and Citizenship. Except for the security interest granted under this Security 
Agreement, Debtor warrants that Debtor is (or, to the extent that the Collateral is to be acquired hereafter, will be) 
the owner of the Collateral free from any prior security interest, lien or encumbrance. Debtor will defend the 
Collateral against all claims and demands of all persons claiming interest therein. Debtor further warrants that it is 
a citizen of the United States as defined by 49 U.S.C. § 40102. 
4. Debtor Will Execute and Deliver Documents. Debtor will, at RACC's request, furnish RACC such information 
and execute and deliver to RACC such documents and do all such acts and things as RACC may reasonably 
request as are necessary or appropriate to assist RACC in establishing and maintaining a valid security interest in 
the Collateral and to assure that the Collateral is properly titled and registered and the security interest perfected 
to RACC's reasonable satisfaction. Debtor will pay the cost of filing all appropriate documents in all public offices 
where RACC deems such filings necessary or desirable. 
5. Operation, Maintenance and Repair. Subject to the Governing Documents, Debtor shall operate, maintain and 
repair the Collateral and retain actual control and possession thereof in accordance with the following provisions: 
5a. Subject to the Governing Documents, Debtor shall have complete use of the Collateral until default, and 
Debtor shall use, operate, maintain and store the Collateral, or any part thereof, properly, carefully and in 
compliance with all applicable statutes, ordinances, regulations, policies of insurance and manufacturer's 
recommendation and operating and maintenance manuals. 
5b. Subject to the Governing Documents, Debtor agrees that the Collateral will be operated only by duly 
certificated and qualified pilots and shall maintain U.S. registry and shall be based within the geographical 
boundaries of the United States. 
5c. Subject to the Governing Documents, Debtor shall be responsible for and pay for all expenses of owning and 
operating the Collateral, including but not limited to storage, fuel, lubricants, service, inspections, overhauls, 
replacements, maintenance and repairs, all in compliance with the manufacturers operating and maintenance

maintenance and operation of the Collateral. 
6. Insurance. Subject to the Governing Documents, Debtor will, at its own expense, keep the Collateral insured at 
all times against loss, damage, theft, and such other casualties as RACC may reasonably require (including hull 
insurance) in such amounts, under such forms of policies, upon such terms, for such periods and with such 
companies or underwriters as RACC may (but has no obligation to) approve. RACC hereby approves the 
insurance provided by RTA pursuant to the Governing Documents. Losses or refunds in all cases shall be 
payable to RACC and Debtor as their interests may appear. In no event shall the amount of such insurance be 
less than the amount of indebtedness due under the Promissory Note. All policies of insurance shall provide for at 
least thirty (30) days prior written notice of cancellation to RACC, and shall contain a breach of warranty 
endorsement in favor of RACC. RACC may obtain such insurance if such insurance is not provided by Debtor. 
Debtor shall furnish to RACC proof satisfactory to RACC of compliance with the provisions of this paragraph.

checks, drafts or other instruments whatsoever payable to Debtor as proceeds or refunds for any such insurance 
and to make claims of loss and to sign proofs of loss against any insurance company and to receive all payments. 
Debtor will pay any deductible portion of such insurance. All risk of loss, damage, destruction or confiscation 
shall at all times be on Debtor.

manner not inconsistent with this Security Agreement. RACC may examine and inspect the Collateral, wherever 
located, at all reasonable times. At its option, but without assuming any obligation to do so, RACC may discharge 
taxes, liens or security interests, or other encumbrances levied or asserted against the Collateral, may place and 
pay for insurance thereon, may order and pay for the repair, maintenance and preservation thereof, and may pay 
any necessary filing or recording fees. Amounts paid by RACC under the preceding sentence shall be added to 
Debtor's unpaid balance under the Promissory Note, shall be secured by the Collateral and shall be payable upon 
demand, together with interest at the rate computed as provided in Paragraph 2 of the Promissory Note until paid 
in full. Subject to the Governing Documents, Debtor shall at all times keep the Collateral, and any proceeds

therefrom, separate and distinct from other property of the Debtor and shall keep accurate and complete records 
of the Collateral' and any such proceeds. 
8. Default. Upon Default, as defined in the Promissory Note, RACC may require Debtor to assemble the 
Collateral and make it available to RACC at a place to be designated by RACC which is reasonably convenient to 
both parties. The requirements of the Kansas Uniform Commercial Code for reasonable notification to Debtor of 
the time and place of any proposed public sale of the Collateral or of the time after which any private sale or other 
intended disposition is to be made, shall be met if such notice is mailed, postage prepaid, to Debtor's address, as 
shown herein, at least twenty (20) days before the time of the sale or disposition. After deduction of all reasonable 
expenses of retaking, holding, preparing for sale or lease, selling, leasing and the like, together with reasonable 
costs of collection, attorneys' fees and legal expenses of RACC, and after the payment of the principal and 
interest due under the Promissory Note, the balance, if any, of the proceeds of the sale may be applied to the 
payment of any or all other indebtedness of Debtor to RACC, whether due or not, whether direct or indirect, 
absolute or contingent, whether now existing or hereafter arising, and whether owing individually or in connection 
with others not parties hereto, and to the satisfaction of indebtedness secured by any subordinate security interest 
in the Collateral of which RACC has received notice prior to distribution of the proceeds. Debtor shall be liable for 
any deficiency after application of such proceeds, to the extent permitted by law. If after a default by Debtor, the 
Collateral is returned to or recovered by RACC, Debtor agrees RACC may fly or otherwise move the Collateral for 
demonstration and other purposes reasonably related to a proposed public or private sale or other disposition of 
the Collateral. 
9. Sale of Aircraft and/or Related Collateral. In the event the Aircraft and/or related Collateral is sold, RACC 
may declare all indebtedness due under the Promissory Note, as well as any other indebtedness or liability 
of Debtor to RACC, immediately due and payable. 
In addition to the foregoing, RACC may (a) sell, or instruct any agent or broker to sell, all or any part of the 
Collateral, and direct such agent or broker to deliver all proceeds thereof to RACC and apply all proceeds to 
the payment of any or all of the unpaid balance owed pursuant to the provisions contained in this Security 
Agreement, in such order and manner as RACC shall choose, in its discretion, and/or (b) cause title to the 
Collateral to be transferred into the name of RACC or its designee. 
Debtor understands and agrees that any sale by RACC of all or part of the Collateral pursuant to the terms of 
this Security Agreement may be effected by RACC at a time and in a manner which could result in the 
proceeds of such sale being significantly and materially less than might have been received if such sale had 
occurred at a different time or in a different manner, and Debtor hereby releases RACC and its officers and 
representatives from and against any and all obligations and/or liabilities arising out of or related to the 
timing or manner of any such sale. All rights and remedies of RACC provided herein are subject to the 
limitations set forth in the Governing Documents that relate to Debtor's interest in the Collateral. 
10. Waiver of Default. No waiver by RACC of any default shall be effective unless in writing, nor operate as a 
waiver of any other default or of the same default in the future. 
11. Restriction on Transfer or Liens. Debtor will not, without the prior written consent of RACC, sell or otherwise 
transfer or encumber the Collateral, or any interest therein, or offer to do so or, except in accordance with the 
Governing Documents, permanently remove or attempt to permanently remove the Collateral from the United 
States. Debtor will keep the Collateral free from any adverse security interest, lien or encumbrance and will not 
permit the Collateral to be attached or replevied. 
12. Taxes. Debtor will promptly pay, or cause to be paid, when due, all taxes and assessments upon the 
Collateral or upon its use or operation or upon this Security Agreement and the obligations evidenced by the 
Promissory Note. 
13. Change of Address. Debtor will notify RACC in writing of any change of address from that shown in this 
Security Agreement within ten (10) days of such change. 
14. GOVERNING LAW AND CHOICE OF FORUM. THIS SECURITY AGREEMENT WAS MADE AND ENTERED 
INTO IN THE STATE OF KANSAS AND THE LAW GOVERNING THIS TRANSACTION SHALL BE THAT OF 
THE STATE OF KANSAS AS IT MAY FROM TIME TO TIME EXIST. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT ANY LEGAL

may be entitled at any time or times. 
The security interest granted herein is a purchase money security interest under the Kansas Uniform Commercial 
Code. 
3. Debtor's Warranty of Title and Citizenship. Except for the security interest granted under this Security 
Agreement, Debtor warrants that Debtor is (or, to the extent that the Collateral is to be acquired hereafter, will be) 
the owner of the Collateral free from any prior security interest, lien or encumbrance. Debtor will defend the 
Collateral against all claims and demands of all persons claiming interest therein. Debtor further warrants that it is 
a citizen of the United States as defined by 49 U.S.C. § 40102. 
4. Debtor Will Execute and Deliver Documents. Debtor will, at RACC's request, furnish RACC such information 
and execute and deliver to RACC such documents and do all such acts and things as RACC may reasonably 
request as are necessary or appropriate to assist RACC in establishing and maintaining a valid security interest in 
the Collateral and to assure that the Collateral is properly titled and registered and the security interest perfected 
to RACC's reasonable satisfaction. Debtor will pay the cost of filing all appropriate documents in all public offices 
where RACC deems such filings necessary or desirable. 
5. Operation, Maintenanceand Repair. Subject to the Governing Documents, Debtor shall operate, maintain and 
repair the Collateral and retain actual control and possession thereof in accordance with the following provisions: 
5a. Subject to the Governing Documents, Debtor shall have complete use of the Collateral until default, and 
Debtor shall use, operate, maintain and store the Collateral, or any part thereof, properly, carefully and in 
compliance with all applicable statutes, ordinances, regulations, policies of insurance and manufacturers 
recommendation and operating and maintenance manuals. 
5b. Subject to the Governing Documents, Debtor agrees that the Collateral will be operated only by duly 
certificated and qualified pilots and shall maintain U.S. registry and shall be based within the geographical 
boundaries of the United States. 
5c. Subject to the Governing Documents, Debtor shall be responsible for and pay for all expenses of owning and 
operating the Collateral, including but not limited to storage, fuel, lubricants, service, inspections, overhauls, 
replacements, maintenance and repairs, all in compliance with the manufacturers operating and maintenance 
manuals and with FAA rules and regulations. Debtor shall properly maintain all records pertaining to the 
maintenance and operation of the Collateral. 
6. Insurance. Subject to the Governing Documents, Debtor will, at its own expense, keep the Collateral insured at 
all times against loss, damage, theft, and such other casualties as RACC may reasonably require (including hull 
insurance) in such amounts, under such forms of policies, upon such terms, for such periods and with such 
companies or underwriters as RACC may (but has no obligation to) approve. RACC hereby approves the 
insurance provided by RTA pursuant to the Governing Documents. Losses or refunds in all cases shall be 
payable to RACC and Debtor as their interests may appear. In no event shall the amount of such insurance be 
less than the amount of indebtedness due under the Promissory Note. All policies of insurance shall provide for at 
least thirty (30) days prior written notice of cancellation to RACC, and shall contain a breach of warranty 
endorsement in favor of RACC. RACC may obtain such insurance if such insurance is not provided by Debtor. 
Debtor shall furnish to RACC proof satisfactory to RACC of compliance with the provisions of this paragraph. 
RACC, and its assigns, are hereby irrevocably appointed attorney-in-fact for Debtor to endorse for Debtor any 
checks, drafts or other instruments whatsoever payable to Debtor as proceeds or refunds for any such insurance 
and to make claims of loss and to sign proofs of loss against any insurance company and to receive all payments. 
Debtor will pay any deductible portion of such insurance. All risk of loss, damage, destruction or confiscation shall 
at all times be on Debtor. 
7. Debtors Possession. Until default, Debtor may have possession of the Collateral and use it in any lawful 
manner not inconsistent with this Security Agreement. RACC may examine and inspect the Collateral, wherever 
located, at all reasonable times. At its option, but without assuming any obligation to do so, RACC may discharge 
taxes, liens or security interests, or other encumbrances levied or asserted against the Collateral, may place and

pay for insurance thereon, may order and pay for the repair, maintenance and preservation thereof, and may pay 
any necessary filing or recording fees. Amounts paid by RACC under the preceding sentence shall be added to 
Debtors unpaid balance under the Promissory Note, shall be secured by the Collateral and shall be payable upon 
demand, together with interest at the rate computed as provided in Paragraph 2 of the Promissory Note until paid 
in full. Subject to the Governing Documents, Debtor shall at all times keep the Collateral, and any proceeds 
therefrom, separate and distinct from other property of the Debtor and shall keep accurate and complete records 
of the Collateral and any such proceeds. 
8. Default. Upon Default, as defined in the Promissory Note, RACC may require Debtor to assemble the Collateral 
and make it available to RACC at a place to be designated by RACC which is reasonably convenient to both 
parties. The requirements of the Kansas Uniform Commercial Code for reasonable notification to Debtor of the 
time and place of any proposed public sale of the Collateral or of the time after which any private sale or other 
intended disposition is to be made, shall be met if such notice is mailed, postage prepaid, to Debtor's address, as 
shown herein, at least twenty (20) days before the time of the sale or disposition. After deduction of all reasonable 
expenses of retaking, holding, preparing for sale or lease, selling, leasing and the like, together with reasonable 
costs of collection, attorneys' fees and legal expenses of RACC, and after the payment of the principal and interest 
due under the Promissory Note, the balance, if any, of the proceeds of the sale may be applied to the payment of 
any or all other indebtedness of Debtor to RACC, whether due or not, whether direct or indirect, absolute or 
contingent, whether now existing or hereafter arising, and whether owing individually or in connection with others 
not parties hereto, and to the satisfaction of indebtedness secured by any subordinate security interest in the 
Collateral of which RACC has received notice prior to distribution of the proceeds. Debtor shall be liable for any 
deficiency after application of such proceeds, to the extent permitted by law. If after a default by Debtor, the 
Collateral is returned to or recovered by RACC, Debtor agrees RACC may fly or otherwise move the Collateral for 
demonstration and other purposes reasonably related to a proposed public or private sale or other disposition of 
the Collateral. 
9. Sale of Aircraft and/or Related Collateral. In the event the Aircraft and/or related Collateral is sold, RACC 
may declare all indebtedness due under the Promissory Note, as well as any other indebtedness or liability 
of Debtor to RACC, immediately due and payable. 
In addition to the foregoing, RACC may (a) sell, or instruct any agent or broker to sell, all or any part of the 
Collateral, and direct such agent or broker to deliver all proceeds thereof to RACC and apply all proceeds to 
the payment of any or all of the unpaid balance owed pursuant to the provisions contained in this Security 
Agreement, in such order and manner as RACC shall choose, in its discretion, and/or (b) cause title to the 
Collateral to be transferred into the name of RACC or its designee. 
Debtor understandsand agrees that any sale by RACC of all or part of the Collateral pursuant to the terms of 
this Security Agreement may be effected by RACC at a time and in a manner which could result in the 
proceeds of such sale being significantly and materially less than might have been received if such sale had 
occurred at a different time or in a different manner, and Debtor hereby releases RACC and its officers and 
representatives from and against any and all obligations and/or liabilities arising out of or related to the 
timing or manner of any such sale. All rights and remedies of RACC provided herein are subject to the 
limitations set forth in the Governing Documents that relate to Debtor's interest in the Collateral. 
10. Waiver of Default. No waiver by RACC of any default shall be effective unless in writing, nor operate as a 
waiver of any other default or of the same default in the future. 
11. Restriction on Transfer or Liens. Debtor will not, without the prior written consent of RACC, sell or otherwise 
transfer or encumber the Collateral, or any interest therein, or offer to do so or, except in accordance with the 
Governing Documents, permanently remove or attempt to permanently remove the Collateral from the United 
States. Debtor will keep the Collateral free from any adverse security interest, lien or encumbrance and will not 
permit the Collateral to be attached or replevied. 
12. Taxes. Debtor will promptly pay, or cause to be paid, when due, all taxes and assessments upon the 
Collateral or upon its use or operation or upon this Security Agreement and the obligations evidenced by the 
Promissory Note.

Code. 
3. Debtors Warranty of Title and Citizenship. Except for the security interest granted under this Security 
Agreement, Debtor warrants that Debtor is (or, to the extent that the Collateral is to be acquired hereafter, will be) 
the owner of the Collateral free from any prior security interest, lien or encumbrance. Debtor will defend the

a citizen of the United States as defined by 49 U.S.C. § 40102. 
4. Debtor Will Execute and Deliver Documents. Debtor will, at RACC's request, furnish RACC such information 
and execute and deliver to RACC such documents and do all such acts and things as RACC may reasonably 
request as are necessary or appropriate to assist RACC in establishing and maintaining a valid security interest in 
the Collateral and to assure that the Collateral is properly tilled and registered and the security interest perfected 
to RACC's reasonable satisfaction. Debtor will pay the cost of filing all appropriate documents in all public offices 
where RACC deems such filings necessary or desirable. 
5. Operation, Maintenanceand Repair. Subject to the Governing Documents, Debtor shall operate, maintain and 
repair the Collateral and retain actual control and possession thereof in accordance with the following provisions: 
5a. Subject to the Governing Documents. Debtor shall have complete use of the Collateral until default, and

compliance with all applicable statutes, ordinances, regulations, policies of insurance and manufacturer's 
recommendation and operating and maintenance manuals.

replacements, maintenance and repairs, all in compliance with the manufacturers operating and maintenance 
manuals and with FAA rules and regulations. Debtor shall properly maintain all records pertaining to the 
maintenance and operation of the Collateral. 
6. Insurance. Subject to the Governing Documents, Debtor will, at its own expense, keep the Collateral insured at 
all times against loss, damage, theft, and such other casualties as RACC may reasonably require (including hull 
insurance) in such amounts, under such forms of policies, upon such terms, for such periods and with such 
companies or underwriters as RACC may (but has no obligation to) approve. RACC hereby approves the 
insurance provided by RTA pursuant to the Governing Documents. Losses or refunds in all cases shall be 
payable to RACC and Debtor as their interests may appear. In no event shall the amount of such insurance be 
less than the amount of indebtedness due under the Promissory Note. All policies of insurance shall provide for at 
least thirty (30) days prior written notice of cancellation to RACC, and shall contain a breach of warranty 
endorsement in favor of RACC. RACC may obtain such insurance if such insurance is not provided by Debtor.

pay for insurance thereon, niay order an pay for the repair, maintenance and preservation thereof, and may pay 
any necessary filing or recording fees. Amounts paid by RACC under the preceding sentence shall be added to 
Debtor's unpaid balance under the Promissory Note, shall be secured by the Collateral and shall be payable upon 
demand, together with interest at the rate computed as provided in Paragraph 2 of the Promissory Note until paid 
in full. Subject to the Governing Documents, Debtor shall at all times keep the Collateral, and any proceeds 
therefrom, separate and distinct from other property of the Debtor and shall keep accurate and complete records 
of the Collateral and any such proceeds. 
8. Default. Upon Default, as defined in the Promissory Note, RACC may require Debtor to assemble the Collateral 
and make it available to RACC at a place to be designated by RACC which is reasonably convenient to both 
parties. The requirements of the Kansas Uniform Commercial Code for reasonable notification to Debtor of the 
time and place of any proposed public sale of the Collateral or of the time after which any private sale or other 
intended disposition is to be made, shall be met if such notice is mailed, postage prepaid, to Debtor's address, as 
shown herein, at least twenty (20) days before the time of the sale or disposition. After deduction of all reasonable 
expenses of retaking, holding, preparing for sale or lease, selling, leasing and the like, together with reasonable 
costs of collection, attorneys' fees and legal expenses of RACC, and after the payment of the principal and interest 
due under the Promissory Note, the balance, if any, of the proceeds of the sale may be applied to the payment of 
any or all other indebtedness of Debtor to RACC, whether due or not, whether direct or indirect, absolute or 
contingent, whether now existing or hereafter arising, and whether owing individually or in connection with others 
not parties hereto, and to the satisfaction of indebtedness secured by any subordinate security interest in the 
Collateral of which RACC has received notice prior to distribution of the proceeds. Debtor shall be liable for any 
deficiency after application of such proceeds, to the extent permitted by law. If after a default by Debtor, the 
Collateral is returned to or recovered by RACC, Debtor agrees RACC may fly or otherwise move the Collateral for 
demonstration and other purposes reasonably related to a proposed public or private sale or other disposition of 
the Collateral. 
9. Sale of Aircraft and/or Related Collateral. In the event the Aircraft and/or related Collateral is sold, RACC 
may declare all indebtedness due under the Promissory Note, as well as any other indebtedness or liability 
of Debtor to RACC, immediately due and payable.

Collateral, and direct such agent or broker to deliver all proceeds thereof to RACC and apply all proceeds to 
the payment of any or all of the unpaid balance owed pursuant to the provisions contained in this Security 
Agreement, in such order and manner as RACC shall choose, in its discretion, and/or (b) cause title to the 
Collateral to be transferred into the name of RACC or its designee. 
Debtor understands and agrees that any sale by RACC of all or part of the Collateral pursuant to the terms of 
this Security Agreement may be effected by RACC at a time and in a manner which could result in the 
proceeds of such sale being significantly and materially less than might have been received if such sale had 
occurred at a different time or in a different manner, and Debtor hereby releases RACC and its officers and 
representatives from and against any and all obligations and/or liabilities arising out of or related to the 
timing or manner of any such sale. All rights and remedies of RACC provided herein are subject to the 
limitationsset forth in the Governing Documents that relate to Debtor's interest iri the Collateral. 
10. Waiver of Default. No waiver by RACC of any default shall be effective unless in writing, nor operate as a 
waiver of any other default or of the same default in the future. 
11. Restriction on Transfer or Liens. Debtor will not, without the prior written consent of RACC, sell or otherwise 
transfer or encumber the Collateral, or any interest therein, or offer to do so or, except in accordance with the 
Governing Documents, permanently remove or attempt to permanently remove the Collateral from the United 
States. Debtor will keep the Collateral free from any adverse security interest, lien or encumbrance and will not 
permit the Collateral to be attached or replevied. 
12. Taxes. Debtor will promptly pay, or cause to be paid, when due, all taxes and assessments upon the 
Collateral or upon its use or operation or upon this Security Agreement and the obligations evidenced by the 
Promissory Note.

I take that back. In one of the initial emails FBI sent over, they included a draft agenda. We have since had discussions 
indicating we don't believe significant aspects of that draft agenda are appropriate, so what they sent over is not current. 
But this is what they sent: 
AGENDA 
Welcome & Introductions by Executive Management 
Investigative team: Explanation of dismissal process after Epstein's suicide; explanation of the judicial process; 
importance of interviewing all pertinent victims; all victims entitled to services but not all may be pertinent to the ongoing 
investigation 
FBI NYO: Safety concerns; media interaction 
VSD: Victim rights and services; State Crime Compensation/EVAF 
Open Q&A and Closing

Didn't we get a rough outline from FBI of what they want to do at these two victim sessions? I can't seem to find. If you 
have, can you forward to=?

Chiefs, 
If you could reach out to your unit and find out, on average, about how many unique victims or potential victims of 
human trafficking (adult or minor) your unit has interviewed in the past year we would appreciate it. It doesn't matter if 
the case was charged. We are trying to get a sense of volume. We realize the answer will be rough and likely zero for 
some units. If you could get back to us by COB Friday we would appreciate it. 
Thanks,

I'll call you separately in a moment, but just in case email is faster, I just received a phone call from defense counsel that a 
person close to Mr. Epstein received a phone call from an individual named 
(phonetic) who claimed to be 
an investigator with the MCC and told the individual that Mr. Epstein's body was ready to be picked up at the hospital and 
that the individual could make arrangements for retrieval of the body. 
left his phone number as 
Can you please confirm whether that individual is in fact with BOP and/or MCC? Defense counsel is understandably 
concerned that they (and others with connections with Mr. Epstein) are starting to get hoax or otherwise inaccurate 
information through phone calls and emails. And we would again respectfully but urgently request that if there is 
information like this that needs to go to representatives for Mr. Epstein, that it come to us so we can pass it along to his 
counsel with confidence that it is true and accurate. 
(Separately, if it is accurate that BOP / MCC is prepared to release Mr. Epstein's body, his defense counsel is extremely 
concerned about whether that has been enough time for a full autopsy and any other investigative steps, and we would 
want to confirm that the FBI team addressing this matter has also been informed—but that's only if this is not a hoax, 
obviously.) 
Please advise as soon as possible, as the individual is waiting to know whether they should take steps to retrieve the body. 
thank you,

It is frankly unbelievable to me that BOP is issuing public press releases on this before telling us basic information so that we 
can relay it to his attorneys who can relay it to his family. When can we expect to get either some sort of statement we can 
pass along to counsel as accurate and reliable or have a call with someone? 
I understand from the Marshals that they have been unsuccessful in reaching anyone with authority at BOP, and given the 
BOP press release that was just put out I assume we need to speak with someone there. Please advise. 
Thank you.

STATEMENT OF MANHATTAN U.S. ATTORNEY ON THE DEATH OF DEFENDANT 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN 
Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said: "Earlier this morning, the Manhattan 
Correctional Center confirmed that Jeffrey Epstein, who faced charges brought by this Office of 
engaging in the sex trafficking of minors, had been found unresponsive in his cell and 
pronounced dead shortly thereafter. Today's events are disturbing, and we are deeply aware of 
their potential to present yet another hurdle to giving Epstein's many victims their day in Court. 
To those brave young women who have already come forward and to the many others who have 
yet to do so, let me reiterate that we remain committed to standing for you, and our investigation 
of the conduct charged in the Indictment — which included a conspiracy count — remains 
ongoing. 
We continue to urge anyone who feels they may be a victim or have information related 
to the conduct in this case to please contact 1-800- CALL FBI."

Expanding on this a little, I believe her name is-- 
or at least that's how she's listed on travel records. We 
have a breakdown of airline tickets purchased with any AmEx card associated with Epstein, which is how he primarily 
booked flights for others (which he did constantly; we have records of more than 4,800 flights that he purchased in the 
past ten years). There are hundreds of flight ticket records for 
dating from 2011 up to as recently as last month. 
Let us know if you want those records; the file is too big to email, but we can add you to the share drive or I can put it in 
the share of a case that

Is it possible to determine a time or timeframe of death? Additionally, the AUSA office is asking of your findings of the 
ligature. If possible could you give me a call, may be easier than emailing back and forth. We are working on getting the

MEMORANDUM 
OPINION & ORDER 
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
Both parties have asked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on 
most of the language, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language 
allowing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on the public 
record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein. 
Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential Government witnesses and their 
counsel from using discovery materials for any purpose other than preparing for the criminal trial 
in this action. The Government has proposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the 
following reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order. 
Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16(d)(1), "[a]t any time the court may, for 
good cause, deny, restrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief." 
The good cause standard "requires courts to balance several interests, including whether 
dissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others . . . whether the imposition of 
the protective order would prejudice the defendant," and "the public's interest in the 
information." United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 506, 522 (S.D.N.Y. 2013). The party 
seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of showing good cause. Cl Gambale v. Deutsche 
Bank AG, 377 F.3d 133, 142 (2d Cir. 2004).

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 37 Filed 07/30/20 Page 2 of 3 
First, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of showing good cause with 
regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged victims and 
witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this litigation. As a 
general matter, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific interest in protecting the 
privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that supports restricting the disclosure of 
their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknowledging that as a baseline the protective order should 
"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense counsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or 
disseminating the identity of any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery 
materials"); see also United States v. Corley, No. 13-cr-48, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 194426, at 
*11 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 15, 2016). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished for 
individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, because 
they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all accusations or public statements 
are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a criminal investigation or prosecution is a 
far different matter than simply making a public statement "relating to" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey 
Epstein, particularly since such a statement might have occurred decades ago and have no 
relevance to the charges in this case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy 
interest that must be safeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks 
undermining the protections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by 
law. In contrast, the Government's proffered language would allow Ms. Maxwell to publicly 
reference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also allows the 
Defense to "referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be relevant .. . to Potential 
Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the investigation and preparation of the 
defense case at trial." Dkt. No. 33-1, ¶ 5. This proposal adequately balances the interests at 
EFTA00013200
--- PAGE 3 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 37 Filed 07/30/20 Page 3 of 3 
stake. And as the Government's letter notes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense 
needs an exception to the protective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make 
applications to the Court on a case-by-case basis. 
Second, restrictions on the ability of potential witnesses and their counsel to use 
discovery materials for purposes other than preparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The 
request appears unprecedented despite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal 
matters that had related civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions 
including Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of 1974, and 
other policies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern 
District of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously follow. 
Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential witnesses with 
materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt. No. 33 at 6. And of 
course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to examination on the record as to 
what materials were provided or shown to them by the Government. Nothing in the Defense's 
papers explains how its unprecedented proposed restriction is somehow necessary to ensure a 
fair trial. 
For the foregoing reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, 
which will be entered on the docket. 
This resolves Dkt. No. 29. 
SO ORDERED.

Those are the images we sent to PAE in September with a request that PAE mass bates stamp them and mark them all 
confidential. PAE then de-duped the images without asking us first, so they had to re-do the production. We have been 
waiting on those 40,000 images for more than a month.

See below for the update from PAE. The good news is that they're getting this back to us on a rolling basis, and it looks 
like we'll have at least some of this stuff in time to produce it by 11/9. The bad news is it does not seem like we'll have all 
of it by that date. It does seem like we'll have greater clarity by early next week. 
I confess, I don't feel like I fully understand all of the steps in this process or why it takes as long as it does, but I'm happy 
to go back to

Charged Cases 
U.S. v. Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN): This summer, we charged Ghislaine Maxwell with 
conspiring to entice minors to travel for the purpose of sexual abuse in connection with helping 
Jeffrey Epstein to abuse his many victims. The case focused on three specific victims that 
traveled to be abused by Epstein, including instances in which Maxwell herself participated in 
the acts of abuse. Trial is set for this coming July. We are finishing discovery, and motions are 
scheduled for December. Motion practice could generate further press; for example, the 
defendant continues to press for the identity of the specific victims, and if she is successful, that 
would surely lead to a round of press about the victims and the details of our case. Relliwe 
are in plea negotiations with counsel fa, 
another Epstein co-conspirator. 
who scheduled hundreds of sexual massages with minors for Epstein but was also a victim of his 
sexual abuse, may plead to an obstruction of justice-related count.

I think it's probably easier to discuss in real time rather than email, unless you prefer otherwise, but the short answer is

In my earlier review of some of the old Epstein 302s and grand jury testimony, I identified the below names as potentially 
significant victim witnesses for various reasons — some being the age, some being conduct that went well beyond 
massages, etc. Can you tell me which if any we have attempted to engage and, for those we have not, thoughts on 
whether to?

I think the only way we could put 
on Epstein is if we have it worked out that she is coming here this summer —
that would involve her agreement plus full buy-in from 
and 
If that is the case, then the fallout from adding 
her is minimal because (1) she is in VOC, which is a unit where it makes sense to have an assistant on this case to begin 
with; and (2) word will get out that she is coming here. I would dispatch 
to tell her that we were only open to it if it 
were confirmed she was coming here. 
Canvassing the list, the other people we could add would be M, 
=, 
or g I sense 
would not be thrilled about 
and I don't feel the need to add 
to anything significant right now, so I would probably say =.

Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
Dear 
We write once again to express our dissatisfaction that the government still has not 
provided a complete set of readable discovery materials to Ms. Maxwell in the MDC. We have 
now had several phone calls and emails to discuss the problems with the discovery, but the 
problems still are not fixed. It is now over five weeks since the August 21 discovery deadline set 
by the court and the government still has not met its discovery obligations. That is simply not 
acceptable. 
In our previous letter, dated September 21, 2020, we outlined for you the numerous 
problems that Ms. Maxwell had been having with unreadable discovery files since she first began 
receiving the government's productions in the MDC in August 2020. This was a continuation of 
the same problem we identified for you in our letter, dated August 27, 2020, when we requested a 
new set of the discovery materials that were fully readable. 
On September 22, 2020, we had a conference call to discuss these issues. On that call, you 
stated that you were trying to address the readability problems, but that in the meantime, defense 
counsel could, among other things, create a laptop computer with a full copy of the discovery 
saved locally that defense counsel could bring to the MDC so that Ms. Maxwell could use it to 
review the unreadable discovery. You also notified us that there were approximately 40,000 non-
nude photographs and images, and thousands of nude or partially nude images, which had been 
seized from Jeffrey Epstein's residences in New York and the Virgin Islands pursuant to search 
warrants, and which you had referenced in your August 21, 2020 production cover letter. You 
further advised that you were in the process of scanning those images so that you could produce 
any documents not marked Highly Confidential in electronic format. Finally, in response to our 
request that Ms. Maxwell be given access to the Highly Confidential documents "at the earliest 
EFTA00013222
--- PAGE 2 ---
October 1, 
Page 2 
possible convenience," you explained that due to COVID-19 restrictions, the U.S. Marshals are 
not producing pretrial detainees to proffer rooms to review discovery and therefore an FBI agent 
would have to bring the materials to the MDC for Ms. Maxwell and defense counsel to review, but 
did not propose a date when that could happen.' 
On September 29, 2020, we had another conference call to further discuss the discovery. 
We advised you that while we planned to create a laptop that we could use to review discovery 
with Ms. Maxwell, it was the government's burden, not the defense's burden, to ensure that Ms. 
Maxwell had a complete, readable copy of the discovery. Moreover, this did not solve the 
problem, as the laptop could only be used during counsel visits and Ms. Maxwell needed a 
complete set of the discovery in the MDC that she could review on her own when defense counsel 
was not visiting. 
We further notified you that we did not believe that making the thousands of images seized 
from Epstein's residences available for inspection at the FBI's offices satisfied the government's 
discovery obligations because Ms. Maxwell could not be produced to the FBI's offices to review 
them. You responded that defense counsel could make a request to have the FBI deliver those 
images to Ms. Maxwell in the MDC. In fact, we had made such a request in our September 22, 
2020 letter, when we asked to schedule a time for Ms. Maxwell to review the Highly Confidential 
documents. That still has not happened. We made an additional request yesterday for Ms. 
Maxwell to be able to review the approximately 40,000 non-nude images seized from Epstein's 
residences as soon as possible, since these do not require defense counsel to be present for her to 
review them in the MDC. Your response was that these images are still being processed for 
production. The government has not produced these materials to Ms. Maxwell if she has no way 
to inspect them at the FBI's offices and they are still not ready for her to review in the MDC. 
Earlier today, you notified us that you have prepared a replacement set of files for the 
documents that Ms. Maxwell has been unable to open at the MDC and requested a hard drive from 
us, which we provided this afternoon. This will now be the third attempt by the government to 
produce a full, readable set of the discovery to Ms. Maxwell (not counting the thousands of 
images that are still being processed for production). Given the past attempts, we can expect that 
the replacement production will take several days to be made available to Ms. Maxwell in the 
MDC and we have little confidence that it will fix the errors when it finally arrives. Ms. Maxwell 
has already lost over a month of time to review these documents, and defense counsel have spent 
hours cataloguing the defects in the prior productions to correct the government's errors. That is 
not acceptable. 
I You also stated that you would send us a formal letter memorializing your responses to the issues raised in our 
September 21, 2020 letter. We have not received any letter from the government. 
EFTA00013223
--- PAGE 3 ---
October 1, 2020 
Page 3 
In sum, the government has not complied with its discovery obligations. We reiterate the 
request we made on the September 29, 2020 conference call that the government create a laptop 
computer, similar to the one that defense counsel is creating, which contains a complete set of the 
discovery and which the government has verified is fully readable, and then provide that laptop 
immediately to Ms. Maxwell in the MDC. We also renew our request that Ms. Maxwell be given 
prompt access to the non-nude images seized from Epstein's residences, and that the government 
propose times next week when Ms. Maxwell and defense counsel can review the Highly 
Confidential documents at the MDC. 
Thank you in advance for your attention to these matters. 
Sincerely, 
/s

Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
Dear 
We write to address three issues. First, we write to express once again our dissatisfaction 
with the incomplete and inadequate production of discovery to Ms. Maxwell in the MDC, and to 
demand that the government find an immediate solution that will permit Ms. Maxwell to review 
all of the discovery materials produced to date. Second, we write to request that the government 
set up a time at the earliest convenience when Ms. Maxwell and defense counsel can review the 
documents marked as "Highly Confidential" in the discovery materials. Third, we write to 
register our objection to the onerous conditions of confinement to which Ms. Maxwell is 
subjected, which are entirely unique to Ms. Maxwell. We request that the government intercede 
directly with the BOP to improve these conditions, as set forth below. 
1. Ms. Maxwell Still Cannot Access All of the Discovery 
One full month has now passed since August 21, 2020, the date the government 
represented to the Court that it would complete production of the initial group of discovery 
materials, and Ms. Maxwell still cannot read a substantial portion of the discovery produced to 
date. The government further represented to the Court at the initial appearance on July 14, 2020 
that this initial group of discovery materials represents "the core of the case" against Ms. Maxwell. 
(Tr. at 12, line 11). Ms. Maxwell has therefore been denied full access to the most critical 
evidence in this case for a month. This is unacceptable and inconsistent with the government's 
obligations and its representations to Judge Nathan; this must be fixed immediately. 
The government represented to the Court at the initial appearance that it was "prepared to 
make a substantial production of discovery" as soon as the protective order was entered. (Tr. 12-
13). However, the government was clearly not prepared to produce discovery, as each of the three 
EFTA00013225
--- PAGE 2 ---
September 21, 2020 
Page 2 
subsequent productions contained numerous unreadable documents and were delivered to Ms. 
Maxwell in the MDC well after the dates on the cover letters. Ms. Maxwell did not receive the 
government's August 5'h production until August 11th and did not receive the August 13th
production until August 17'h. As you recall, Ms. Maxwell did not receive the hard drive with the 
government's third and final production in this first phase of discovery until August 25, 2020, 
several days after the August 21, 2020 deadline imposed by the Court. 
On a conference call on August 27, 2020, we advised you of the substantial number of 
documents in all three productions that Ms. Maxwell was unable to access, and even proposed 
possible technological solutions that we thought might alleviate the problem — namely, shortening 
the file paths to the documents and producing the documents on a hard drive with onboard 
encryption, as opposed to McAfee encryption. Later that same day, we sent you a follow-up letter 
listing the unreadable documents and requesting that the government immediately reproduce to 
Ms. Maxwell a new set of all of the discovery materials produced to date in a format that she could 
access on her computer at the MDC, and provide the appropriate software tools that will allow her 
to review all of the discovery files. That same day we also shipped to you two separate hard 
drives — one with onboard encryption and one without — to use to load the replacement production. 
The new hard drive was not made available to Ms. Maxwell at the MDC until the late 
afternoon of September 9, 2020, almost two weeks later. While some of the previously unreadable 
documents are now readable, Ms. Maxwell still cannot access a substantial portion of the 
discovery materials, including certain file types and extensions. For example, Ms. Maxwell 
cannot read any documents that have .XLS or .EML file extensions. Ms. Maxwell also still cannot 
access the following documents:

It is the responsibility of the government, not the defense, to ensure that Ms. Maxwell has a 
complete set of the discovery that she can review in the MDC. Defense counsel should not be in 
the position of having to suggest technological fixes to help the government satisfy its own Rule 
obligations, which have not been met. Without access to the full discovery materials, Ms. 
Maxwell cannot participate in the preparation of her defense. Accordingly, we demand that the 
EFTA00013228
--- PAGE 5 ---
September 21, 2020 
Page 5 
government immediately fix all of the issues with Ms. Maxwell's discovery so that she can review 
all of the discovery materials produced to date.' 
Ms. Maxwell also does not have access to a table or a writing surface on which to take 
notes when she is reviewing the discovery. The desktop computer she uses to review discovery 
sits on a table that is only wide enough to accommodate the computer, leaving no room to take 
notes. Ms. Maxwell must attempt to write while the paper is on her lap or rest the paper sideways 
on the little available space next to the computer. Furthermore, the computer screen uses to view 
the discovery faces the prison guard station and the doorway to the rec room, where the phone is 
located. As a result, any time a guard answers the phone or enters or exits the rec room, which 
occurs as much as 40 times a day or more, Ms. Maxwell has to turn off the computer screen to 
prevent the guards from seeing what she is reviewing. 
These conditions severely impact Ms. Maxwell's ability to prepare her defense and provide 
written instructions to her legal team. We therefore request that you speak to the warden about 
providing Ms. Maxwell with a desk and reorienting the computer screen so that it is not visible to 
the prison guards. 
2. Ms. Maxwell and Defense Counsel Request Access to All Documents Designated 
as "Highly Confidential" 
According to the Protective Order in this case, Ms. Maxwell may only review the 
documents marked by the government as "Highly Confidential" in the presence of defense counsel 
and "under the protection of law enforcement officers or employees." (Dkt. 36 ¶ 14). 
Accordingly, we request that the government schedule a time at the earliest possible convenience 
for Ms. Maxwell and defense counsel to review all of the "Highly Confidential" documents 
produced to date, pursuant to the terms of the Protective Order. 
3. Ms. Maxwell's Conditions of Confinement Must Be Improved 
Ms. Maxwell's conditions of confinement are extraordinarily onerous and unlike those of 
any other inmate at the MDC (or in BOP custody, to our knowledge). In fact, in the time that Ms. 
Maxwell has been at the MDC, she has met with four separate wardens and interim wardens, and 
each has told her that they have never seen in their collective years of experience anything like her 
current regime. We have written to the current warden twice in the last three weeks — on August 
28, 2020 and September 9, 2020 — making specific requests to improve the conditions of her 
I We exclude from this any discovery materials marked "Highly Confidential" that she is not permitted to review in 
the MDC under the terms of the Protective Order in this case. The "Highly Confidential" documents are the subject of 
the defense's second request. 
EFTA00013229
--- PAGE 6 ---
September 21, 2020 
Page 6 
confinement, but have received no response. Accordingly, we now ask the government to 
intercede with the BOP to make the following improvements. 
a. Living Conditions, Surveillance, and Searches 
Despite being housed on an entire floor by herself, Ms. Maxwell is forced to sleep and 
spend half of her time in a confined space ominously referred to as the "isolation cell," which is 
roughly 7x9 feet. While she is inside the isolation cell, Ms. Maxwell is constantly watched by 2-3 
prison guards and has two cameras trained on her every second — one in the ceiling and a 
supplemental handheld camera that is usually positioned only about four feet away from her. She 
gets very little sleep, as she is woken up by flashing lights, loud discussions among the guards, 
and adjustments of the supplemental camera. Ms. Maxwell is effectively being kept in solitary 
confinement (she has now been housed alone for over 80 days) and treated as if she were on 
suicide watch even though she is not, and has never been suicidal. Moreover, she is being treated 
like a laboratory rat, with her every movement is recorded by the prison guards every 15 minutes. 
Ms. Maxwell is supposed to be allowed out of the isolation cell from 7am to 8pm each day 
and taken to a separate rec room on the same floor, where a desktop computer and a shower are 
located, so that she can review the discovery and maintain her personal hygiene. However, she is 
frequently picked up late and returned to the isolation cell early. For example, this past Friday, 
September 18, 2020, Ms. Maxwell had an in-person counsel visit that was supposed to begin at 
11:00 a.m. Ms. Maxwell was not picked up from the isolation cell until after 8am and was not 
delivered to the visiting room until approximately 45 minutes after the meeting was supposed to 
begin. When Ms. Maxwell finally arrived, she then needed to be strip-searched before the meeting 
could begin, which meant that the visit was cut short by almost an hour.2
Ms. Maxwell is also searched more frequently and extensively than any other pretrial 
detainee of which we are aware. Each time Ms. Maxwell is moved from the isolation cell, she is 
searched and her cell is searched, and she is often searched again when she arrives at the rec room, 
all of which takes up time she could be using to review the discovery. Then process is repeated 
when Ms. Maxwell is brought back to the isolation cell. This past Friday, Ms. Maxwell was 
searched at least five separate times and strip-searched twice. Each time, Ms. Maxwell had her 
mouth searched by prison guards who put their hands inside her mouth, which exposes her to 
heightened risk of COVID-19 transmission. 
Given the disruption caused by moving Ms. Maxwell each day, we do not see why Ms. 
Maxwell could not be housed in the rec room where the computer and shower are located, instead 
of the isolation cell. In fact, Ms. Maxwell was told on several occasions by previous wardens and 
Ms. Maxwell was also not given approved legal calls with counsel on August 25, 2020 and August 27, 2020. 
EFTA00013230
--- PAGE 7 ---
September 21, 2020 
Page 7 
interim wardens that this was the plan. We ask that the government talk to the current warden 
about implementing this change. 
b. Body Scans 
Ms. Maxwell is subjected to a body scan each week, and until recently, she received 
approximately three per week. We assume these are to see if Ms. Maxwell has secreted anything 
inside her body. We do not understand why it is necessary for the BOP to administer body scans 
on such a regular and frequent basis — and thereby repeatedly expose Ms. Maxwell to radiation —
especially when she is already under constant surveillance and the scans have all come up 
negative. We ask that these body scans be curtailed significantly or eliminated, if possible. 
c. Access to the Commissary 
Although the MDC nominally approved Ms. Maxwell's request for permission to purchase 
from the full prison commissary list in August 2020, in fact, her access to the commissary is still 
extremely limited. To name just one example, she has not been able to purchase sports bras that 
fit since she arrived at the MDC. Ms. Maxwell cannot be denied such a basic article of clothing. 
Among other things, it means that she cannot engage in aerobic exercise necessary to stay healthy. 
We are more than happy to send Ms. Maxwell whatever brand of underwear is approved by the 
MDC, but we cannot do so without the permission of the warden. We therefore ask the 
government to speak to the warden about granting defense counsel permission to send Ms. 
Maxwell approved commissary items, including underwear, and to give her access to the full 
commissary list. 
d. Food/Care Packages 
Ms. Maxwell's meals have been a persistent problem and are entirely inadequate. She has 
been given non-vegetarian meals and has been denied food on the prison menu. For example, she 
often receives meals with no protein and was recently given only bread and butter for several 
meals with no additional food. It was not until Ms. Maxwell was given access to the menu for the 
first time on September 1, after she complained that she had been given a non-vegetarian meal, 
that she realized that she had not been receiving full meals with all of the nutritional components 
since arriving at MDC. 
Moreover, she has often has been given inedible food, such as frozen black bananas, and 
has not been fed at all for long stretches of time. For example, this past weekend she was not fed 
anything for a period of more than 20 hours from Saturday late afternoon until Sunday at midday. 
As a result of this inadequate nutrition, she has lost a great deal of weight since arriving at MDC. 
The MDC's response to this problem was to remove the scale from the rec room so that she can no 
longer weigh herself and keep track of how much weight she is losing. This is unconscionable 
EFTA00013231
--- PAGE 8 ---
September 21, 2020 
Page 8 
and unacceptable. This lack of food also severely affects her ability to concentrate and review 
discovery to prepare her defense. 
We therefore ask the government to speak to the warden about ensuring that Ms. Maxwell 
is given full access to the prison menu, that she be given complete meals on a timely basis, and 
that her food is, at the very least, edible and provides her with enough nutrition to stop her weight 
loss. We also ask that Ms. Maxwell, like other detainees, be given permission to receive care 
packages of approved food items to supplement her diet. 
e. Non-Delivery of Mail and Other Items 
Delivery of mail to Ms. Maxwell has also been a problem. Ms. Maxwell's friends and 
family members have mailed her numerous letters since she arrived at the MDC. However, as of 
yesterday, she has only received a handful of these letters, despite being correctly addressed. 
Several of these letters appear to have been rejected because they were written on colored paper, 
as opposed to white paper, even this prohibition appears nowhere in the prison regulations. It took 
six weeks for these letters to be rejected. And even though these letters were all resent on white 
paper, only one of the nine letters has been delivered to Ms. Maxwell thus far. At the same time, 
Ms. Maxwell has received hundreds of letters from people she does not know. We do not know 
why most of the letters that she cares about have not been delivered, while there seems to be no 
limit whatsoever on the number of letters she can receive from complete strangers. 
Ms. Maxwell has also not received shipments of approved items from Amazon. For 
example, on August 13, 2020, her counsel placed an Amazon order for a package of five BOP-
approved flexible pens and eight BOP-approved legal pads. The legal pads were delivered to the 
MDC on August 18, 2020, and the pens were delivered on August 19, 2020. Both deliveries were 
rejected as undeliverable without reason. Similarly, the delivery of a book was rejected and 
returned for no apparent reason. And to our knowledge, none of the copies of The New York 
Times, which are approved and have been paid for since August 1, 2020, have been delivered to 
Ms. Maxwell. We do not understand why these items were rejected or have not been delivered. 
We were also not permitted to deliver a new pair of reading glasses to Ms. Maxwell to 
replace the ones that BOP personnel broke in a search of her cell shortly after she arrived at the 
MDC. Instead, we had to wait until Ms. Maxwell received approval to receive the glasses and 
then had to mail them to her. As result, Ms. Maxwell was without her reading glasses for over 
two months from early July 2020 until September 16, 2020, when they finally were provided to 
her at the MDC. It therefore has been extremely difficult for Ms. Maxwell to review the discovery 
until now. 
We therefore ask the government to speak to the warden about ensuring that Ms. 
Maxwell's personal mail is delivered in a timely fashion, and that future deliveries of approved 
items are not rejected and are delivered to Ms. Maxwell. 
EFTA00013232
--- PAGE 9 ---
September 21, 2020 
Page 9 
In her August 25, 2020 Opinion and Order, Judge Nathan stated that if Ms. Maxwell is not 
being provided sufficient access to the discovery materials "so that she can meaningfully 
participate in the preparation of her defense," defense counsel may seek intervention by the Court. 
(Dkt. 49 at 2). Judge Nathan further stated that while she had not been presented any evidence 
that Ms. Maxwell's conditions of confinement were punitive or motivated by an improper 
purpose, she nevertheless ordered the government "to provide written status updates every 90 days 
detailing any material changes to conditions of Ms. Maxwell's confinement, with particular 
emphasis on her access to legal materials and ability to communicate with defense counsel." (Id.). 
For the reasons set forth above, the government and the BOP are not providing adequate 
conditions that allow Ms. Maxwell access to the discovery materials so that she can meaningfully 
participate in the preparation of her defense. Ms. Maxwell has been provided hard drives 
containing a substantial number of unreadable files and therefore still cannot review the entire 
discovery production, even though it is now one month after the discovery deadline has passed. 
Furthermore, the conditions of Ms. Maxwell's confinement have deteriorated since our last 
application to the Court for relief. She is not being fed a sufficient amount of food and is losing a 
great deal of weight, which makes it very difficult for her to review the discovery and prepare her 
defense. Ms. Maxwell is also subjected to a level of surveillance that is intrusive, aggressive, 
constant, unnecessary and unjustifiable on the grounds of safety and security. These measures are 
akin to punishment, which is inappropriate for any pretrial detainee, especially one who, like Ms. 
Maxwell, has never once received a disciplinary infraction. 
We seek your urgent intervention on these issues now, well before the November 25, 2020 
deadline for the government's first written status update to the Court, because these matters simply 
cannot wait until then to be remedied. We further reserve all of our rights with regard to these 
issues, including the right to seek intervention from the Court, if these matters are not addressed 
expeditiously.

Hey MI,

(USANYS) 
I leave it up to the AUSAs on your question regarding native files. The productions look good to me but I do have one 
question. The drive that we sent to be uploaded contained about 41,000 files. In these two productions I only see a total 
of about 22,000. Is that because there are some natives that couldn't be imaged and are thus not viewable on the 
database?

we agree. First, this goes beyond what we said we would do or told the court we would do. Second, in 
any event, we are separately gathering any potentially relevant emails from the agent with victims or witnesses. Third, we 
have no reason to believe there were significant gaps in retention or collection for 
such that we would expect 
that any of his emails with her would be in what we already have.

een a while — hope you're well. This was from a while ago, but we need to follow up on the below questions I asked 
about last year when you scanned in a number of boxes relating to the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, now that discovery is 
underway in the Maxwell case. 
The first question is on the discs from the boxes, which you mentioned you did not extract but which you made copies of. 
Can you please tell us how those discs were marked? We're not sure that we can tell them apart from the other DVDs we 
received that contain the hard-copy scans. Did the copied discs get transmitted with those DVDs, or were the sets of four 
discs kept in the boxes themselves? (And either way, what would their labeling be?) 
And second, you mentioned that there were some pornographic images that were not scanned, and said you would 
follow up to see if a notation was made as to where those images were located or if they could be readily found in output. 
The issue is that if we don't know which specific items weren't scanned in a set of 20-something boxes, we may have no 
choice but to just do the entire project over again, rather than trying to go page by page comparing the hard copies to the 
scans to see what's missing. 
Please let us know as soon as possible? And either I ot 
cc'd here, will follow up on whatever the next 
steps are.

That's great, thanks very much for all your and your team's work and for the update. That makes sense regarding the lAs, 
thanks. 
With respect to the images that were not scanned, is there any way to flag them in the original hard copies somehow, so 
that we can easily find them and refer to them when the hard copy documents are sent back to New York? Just to avoid 
needing to try to flip through all the original documents to find them. Let me check and see if a notation was made as to 
where these images were located or if I can readily/easily find them in output. 
Regarding the discs, I'm not sure I totally understand — when you say four copies each, were there just four discs total? Or 
possibly I'm just misunderstanding the explanation. And related, is it right that those discs were not processed (just 
copied) so we'll need to look at those separate for our review? Sorry I should have been clearer. We just copied the discs —
not processed and made four copies each which is our standard. The thought being when we burn output we always give 
a complete set that in theory would go to the defense, AUSA, and two copies to the Agent (one for him/and a back-up). 
The discs we found in the files contain pdfs (searchable), jpgs, gifs, and tif files 
EFTA00013245

And final question is just how all the scanned materials will be transmitted, so we can plan how most efficiently to receive 
them and get them processed here. We will send everything back to you on dvds.

Good Afternoon! 
Here is the latest. We have finished scanning! 
In the course of going through the paper it was discovered that at some point in time (perhaps between 2013 and 2015 
when it was last digitized) three 1As failed to make it back into their respective file jackets. It's not clear what happened or 
who is at fault. I can tell you that we were able to conduct a search of our local network and retrieve the images. I spoke 
with our Field Evidence Unit who recommended that prior to inserting the images we create a cover sheet that reflected 
that the images were not a part of the "original" paper rather they were regenerated from a digital copy. The 1As in 
questions are 1A10, 1A28, 1A84 as well as two missing serials in 31E-MM-108062-al SEC 001 SER 1-45. My digital team is 
addressing this matter and has assured me I'll be able to burn the output first thing Monday so that we can get everything 
returned to you. 
A few other items to point out. There were some pornographic images of young girls. These were not imaged per our 
protocols. You As you review the content anywhere these images may have been you will see a DocLab kicksheet that 
states "possible child pornography" DO NOT SCAN. The original documents are still in their original location — they were 
just not scanned. 
Finally, there were a number of discs scattered throughout. We made physical copies — one for one ratio of each (four 
copies each) to go along with the physical paper scanned. These wil be sent along with the discs we will generate. 
Please let me know if you have any questions. I'll be in bright and early Monday morning.

Happy 4th of July Eve. We just received 22 boxes about 5 minutes ago. We discovered that the Miami Field Office had 
requested DocLab to scan a number of them back in 2013. I'm hoping (fingers crossed) that the images are available on

a way you're comfortable with—being able to scan each document separately, dealing with any random scraps of paper, 
post-its, etc etc. If doing the best possible job requires an extra few days that's totally understandable, especially given the

I might just say that we intend to implement a privilege review of materials for which that would be appropriate—for 
example, I believe that the FBI takes the view that photos do not need to be reviewed for privilege in the first instance. 
But otherwise sounds fine, and happy to discuss that further if useful.

Marty just reached out to me and wants to provide me with Epstein's list of counsel as long as I agree not to share it with 
the case team without his consent and that we implement a privilege review of the materials seized from Epstein. So 
unless you want to discuss, I plan to agree to the former and confirm the latter. I ran it by

Hope you're doing well, and thanks very much for your help with privilege issues for this review. In our review of this 
database, we have come across some communications (emails and reports)from private investigators— among others, 
an investigator named Roy Black. We are generally aware that Epstein hired private investigators in connection with a 
criminal investigation and related civil litigation in Florida. 
We don't know whether these materials are privileged. Could you possibly confer with the estate attorneys to 
determine whether they are asserting a privilege over communications by private investigators? In the meantime, we 
will stop reviewing the database unless we hear from you otherwise. 
Thanks very much,

Of course, no problem. And the discs are in the hard copy Epstein "file," which consists of three redwelds on the shelves

A couple things to note on the discs themselves — first, there are two sets, so don't be surprised when there are many 
more than 55 total. And second, that number is approximate — I don't think I had personally counted them when I sent 
the email toM 
and also there are substantive discs and load file discs. But it was around that number, and in any 
event, they're all on that shelf. And hopefully=vill be able to send, or point you toward, an index for those materials

I actually found the answers to some of this morning's questions. They're a few emails below (but I'm including the chain 
for context). The answer from 
on the discs—the highlights below are her responses; you guys should have that 
email in your records as well—is that they did not extract the contents of the discs that were "scattered throughout" the 
boxes. They made copies of them, like actual digital copies, but did not extract them onto the DVDs that were the "scans" 
of the boxes. So those discs will still need to be extracted / uploaded to be reviewed. 
The one wrinkle on those discs is, keep in mind that we sent all the discs that_gave us to be unitized and uploaded 
to Relativity by our own vendor. So if it happens to be that what we sent to our vendor was (1) a bunch of discs that 
included scanned hard copies, and (2) some discs that were just copies of discs, our vendor may actually have solved this 
problem for us. I think the way to check that is to asnow 
those four-set-discs were labeled, and also to ask 
f there are any discs still in the boxes (if not, we've already had them scanned and uploaded to Relativity). I should 
say, I have something due tomorrow so I'm in the office, so I just looked at the discs themselves, and to me there's no 
obvious way to check this on what we have — e.g., no discs are marked "1 of 4". 
I also asked at the time about any images that were not scanned, and she said at the time she would check on those and 
get back to us. She never did. The context to that is, I think, that this was all in mid- and late-July 2019. There then were a 
number of technical issues on getting the data from the DVDs sent by the FBI uploaded to Relativity, which went into the 
first week or so of August. And then of course on August 10, our world changed, and we were no longer doing discovery. 
In any event, I'll email 
ow on two questions: First, the discs that we supposedly received four copies of, how were 
they labeled (and are t ey inc uded in the approximately 55 discs we received back, or were they put into the boxes with 
EFTA00013261
--- PAGE 2 ---
the hard copy files)? And second, the question of any hard copy documents they didn't scan. (And will also emailM 
and=o see where the boxes physically are now.) 
Obviously I don't have a vote, but personally, unless FBI did some very specific notations in the originals that are easily 
accessible, it's just 23 boxes — we could, and should, just send those boxes to a vendor now. They'd be back in your hands 
in a week or two, and you'd actually have everything you need.

That's great, thanks very much for all your and your team's work and for the update. That makes sense regarding the lAs, 
thanks. 
With respect to the images that were not scanned, is there any way to flag them in the original hard copies somehow, so 
that we can easily find them and refer to them when the hard copy documents are sent back to New York? Just to avoid 
needing to try to flip through all the original documents to find them. Let me check and see if a notation was made as to 
where these images were located or if I can readily/easily find them in output. 
Regarding the discs, I'm not sure I totally understand — when you say four copies each, were there just four discs total? Or 
possibly I'm just misunderstanding the explanation. And related, is it right that those discs were not processed (just 
copied) so we'll need to look at those separate for our review? Sorry I should have been clearer. We just copied the discs —
not processed and made four copies each which is our standard. The thought being when we burn output we always give 
a complete set that in theory would go to the defense, AUSA, and two copies to the Agent (one for him/and a back-up). 
The discs we found in the files contain pdfs (searchable), jpgs, gift, and tif files 
And final question is just how all the scanned materials will be transmitted, so we can plan how most efficiently to receive 
them and get them processed here. We will send everything back to you on dvds.

Good Afternoon! 
Here is the latest. We have finished scanning! 
In the course of going through the paper it was discovered that at some point in time (perhaps between 2013 and 2015 
when it was last digitized) three 1As failed to make it back into their respective file jackets. It's not clear what happened or 
who is at fault. I can tell you that we were able to conduct a search of our local network and retrieve the images. I spoke 
with our Field Evidence Unit who recommended that prior to inserting the images we create a cover sheet that reflected 
that the images were not a part of the "original" paper rather they were regenerated from a digital copy. The 1As in 
questions are 1A10, 1A28, 1A84 as well as two missing serials in 
 My digital team is 
addressing this matter and has assured me I'll be able to burn the output first thing Monday so that we can get everything 
returned to you. 
A few other items to point out. There were some pornographic images of young girls. These were not imaged per our 
protocols. You As you review the content anywhere these images may have been you will see a DocLab kicksheet that 
states "possible child pornography" DO NOT SCAN. The original documents are still in their original location — they were 
just not scanned. 
Finally, there were a number of discs scattered throughout. We made physical copies — one for one ratio of each (four 
copies each) to go along with the physical paper scanned. These wil be sent along with the discs we will generate. 
Please let me know if you have any questions. I'll be in bright and early Monday morning.

Happy 4th of July Eve. We just received 22 boxes about 5 minutes ago. We discovered that the Miami Field Office had 
requested DocLab to scan a number of them back in 2013. I'm hoping (fingers crossed) that the images are available on 
our internal network so that I can access them and just simply reprocess the digital output, if not we'll re-prep and scan 
accordingly. We will keep you posted.

We're under time pressure but I think the most important thing is that your folks have the time you need to do the job in 
a way you're comfortable with—being able to scan each document separately, dealing with any random scraps of paper, 
post-its, etc etc. If doing the best possible job requires an extra few days that's totally understandable, especially given the 
holiday. Thanks again for the focus on it, and for following up.

Good afternoon, 
(USANYS) < 
At the request of defense counsel, our office is preparing a new drive with a copy of discovery material that was 
previously produced to Ghislaine Maxwell on a CD, but which she has been unable to view. The drive will be ready 
tomorrow. Today, defense counsel asked that Maxwell be able to review those materials over this coming weekend, but 
no one from our office is available to hand deliver the drive tomorrow, and we understand that Maxwell would not 
receive a FedEx package sent out tomorrow until next week. Defense counsel has offered to pick the drive up from our 
office and hand deliver it to the MDC themselves tomorrow. Would that be permissible?

Hi, 
Defense counsel in Tartaglione has requested to see the attorney visit logs and count slips that have Tartaglione's name on 
them. Those documents may be covered by the attached protective order, and so we have asked 
. who is 
firewall counsel in Tartaglione, to receive the documents from you for potential production to defense counsel (so that

Judge Karas to modify the order to allow her to receive the documents, so please don't send them to 
until she 
reaches out. Thanks for helping with this —we know it is a pain.

v. 
NICHOLAS TARTAGLIONE, 
Defendant. 
X 
Cr. 832 (KMK) 
Kenneth M. ICaras, District Judge: 
WHEREAS, the Bureau of Prisons ("BOP") has certain procedures 
in place to protect the workings of its institutions; 
WHEREAS, the defendant, by and through counsel, has raised the 
concern that certain of the GOP's procedures have the potential to result in defense 
strategy and attorney work product being revealed to the Government in 
circumvention of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and the Criminal 
Justice Act; 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED: 
1. 
The BOP shall be prohibited from providing to Federal 
prosecutors the originals and/or copies of any written communication designated 
"attorney work-product" sent by members of the defense team to BOP staff at the 
MCC, MDC, or any other facility in which Nicholas Tartaglione (#78514-054) 
might be held prior to trial in this case. To facilitate the secure implementation 
of this prohibition, the BOP shall not place such materials in Mr. Tartaglione's

2. 
The BOP shall be prohibited from providing to Federal 
prosecutors the originals and/or copies of visitation logs related to "attorney 
visits" and/or "legal visits" of Nicholas Tartaglione (#78514-054); this includes 
visits to Mr. Tartaglione by defense counsel or other members of the defense team 
such as investigators, mitigation specialists, experts, consultants, and mitigation 
witnesses. 
(This proscription does not include "social visits," which are 
memorialized in a separate visitation log.) 
3. 
To the extent the United States Attorney's Office is already 
in the possession of the type of communications and visitation logs addressed 
above, then the Government should immediately disclose all such material to Mr. 
Tartaglione so that the defense may then ascertain whether to seek relief under 
Rule 12 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. 
4. 
Should Mr. Tartaglione be transferred to a non-BOP facility such 
as the Westchester County Correctional Facility in Valhalla, New York, this Order 
should be interpreted to maintain the same effect.

Subject: Ghislaine Maxwell 02879-509 
Counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell (02879-509) write to report that she was physically mistreated 
and verbal)  threatened by MDC staff over the weekend. 
Officer MI (sp) performed a body search of Ms. Maxwell inside her isolation cell with her back to the 
handheld camera. 
During the search, Officer 
squeezed Ms. Maxwell's breast with vice-like pressure equivalent to a 
mammography. 
Ms. Maxwell physically recoiled in response to pain caused by Officer 
Another guard, Officer 
(sP) 
threatened to charge Ms. Maxwell with "assaulting an officer" should she move again during a search of her 
person. 
Ms. Maxwell reported the physical incident to a staff psychologist and to an associate warden and was 
examined by 
medical staff. In addition to written reports, the physical and verbal incidents should have been captured on the 
hand-held 
camera, used constantly to surveil Ms. Maxwell. 
This is not the first time Ms. Maxwell has been touched inappropriately by MDC staff, as MDC records should 
reflect. 
Counsel for Ms. Maxwell make this report to put the MDC on notice: 
Should Ms. Maxwell be further assaulted and threatened, we will file an official complaint with the Attorney 
General's Office 
and notify the Court. This will further blemish the BOP's reputation, already tarnished by negligence 
resulting in the death of Jeffrey Epstein. The restrictive conditions of Ms. Maxwell's detention in the MDC 
correlate directly to the Epstein debacle in the MCC, making unprovoked rough treatment of Ms. Maxwell 
baffling. 
Be further advised, should Ms. Maxwell face any retaliation as a result of this email, 
this too will be promptly reported.

I apologize about not getting back with you. I thought the other attorney that filed the response was going to do so. 
Regardless, the response included everything that Interlochen has. They only keep tuition payment information for 7 
years and nothing in their files reflects any payments by Epstein or Epstein entities.

Thank you both very much for your assistance in response to our subpoenas seeking records from Interlochen. In 
reviewing the documents you produced in response to the attached subpoena, a follow-up question arose. Would you 
please confirm that your production included all records of any tuition payments that Epstein (or his entities) made for 
any students at Interlochen? 
Our team is also happy to discuss this inquiry over the phone if that would be useful. I am starting a trial tomorrow

Case 1:18-cr-00454-KPF Document 306 Filed 12/29/20 Page 1 of 2 
The Honorable Katherine Polk Failla 
United States District Judge 
Southern District of New York 
Foley Square 
NY, NY 10007 
December 29, 2020 
Re: Unites States v. Efrain Reyes 
18-cr-454 
Dear Judge Failla: 
MEMO ENDORSED 
I respectfully write as a member of the public and reporter for the New York Daily News 
covering the case of US v. Reyes, 18-cr-454. 
I write in regard to Reyes's change of plea hearing on 8/26/19 and sentencing on 4/13/20. 
I'm told the transcripts of both proceedings are under seal. There are also no sentencing 
submissions from the government or Reyes's attorney posted on the docket. 
Reyes died last month at his mother's apartment in the Bronx. He is the subject of public 
interest because he was the last person to share a cell with Jeffrey Epstein. 
As you are aware, there exists a presumption of access to court proceedings and judicial 
documents under both the common law and our Constitution. This presumption is overcome 
solely when Your Honor makes a specific finding on the record that a compelling interest in 
secrecy overrides this interest. Any restrictions of access must be narrowly tailored. 
"The public and press have a qualified First Amendment right of access to plea and sentencing 
proceedings." United States v. Alcantara, 396 F.3d 189, 191-2 (2d Cir. 2005). 
The presumption of access is based on the view that secrecy erodes trust in courts and judges, 
and access enhances trust. To keep these materials sealed would create the appearance that 
the presumption is designed to avoid -- that the Court is keeping a matter of public concern 
under wraps. 
I respectfully request that your Honor unseal the proceedings mentioned above and order the 
docketing of sentencing submissions for Reyes. Alternatively, I ask you make a finding on the 
record explaining why they should remain under wraps. 
Thank you for your attention.

Good afternoon Bobbi: 
We have receive your concerns and will be looking in to these matters. 
All concerns will be properly addressed as needed. 
Best, 
>>> BOBBI C STERNHEIM •<

Counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell learned that she has been issued a disciplinary charge. Please provide a copy of 
the Incident Report. 
Members of the same team who physically mistreated and threatened Ms. 
Maxwell on Sunday now claim that she is not tidy (See email below.) The basis of the charge is unclear -
because Ms. Maxwell has not deviated from her routine of the past 7 months. But the fact that it comes after Ms. 
Maxwell and counsel made complaints about staff is concerning, disturbing, and questionable. 
The policy of rotating in staff from other institutions has contributed to lack of consistency and clarity in the 
management of Ms. Maxwell. One team tells her one thing which is then contradicted by another team. 
One team tells her she can't keep books in her locker; another team tells her to put books in her locker. One team 
tells her to keep a set of clothes in her isolation cell; another team faults her for doing so. 
Ms. Maxwell's request for guidance is met with a terse response: "Read the A&O handbook." 
Ms. Maxwell cannot ask other inmates for help and is at the mercy of guards who appear to delight is their 
power over her. The present team was particularly harsh during a previous rotation and seem to have increased 
their contempt for Ms. Maxwell. 
Ms. Maxwell- and counsel- are concerned for her safety while in the custody of the present team. 
In lieu of an opportunity for Ms. Maxwell to be moved to another unit, and the unlikelihood that she would be 
transferred to the MCC as a result of Epstein's death while BOP was "asleep" on the watch, we are requesting 
that the present team be removed from guarding Ms. Maxwell. 
Issues still remain concerning Ms. Maxwell's meals.She still is not receiving items on the menu. 
Yesterday, she received the same meal for lunch and dinner. Tuesday morning she was given an inedible black 
and rotting banana. Over the weekend she was given bologna, despite being on a non-flesh diet. The guard 
EFTA00013290
--- PAGE 2 ---
informed her that the meat had not been refrigerated and recommended that she not eat it. 
The MDC's inability to provide proper nutrition is reoccurring and problematic. 
The problems keep escalating, giving rise to the belief that Ms. 
Maxwell is being targeted and victimized. I urge you to address and correct these problems. The failure to do so 
will result in a request for court intervention.

"MDC legal counsel confirmed that no staff member has ever directed 
Ms. Maxwell to remain in a particular location within her isolation cell. 
They confirmed that staff understand that no such directions should be given." 
last evening (12/29), Ms. Maxwell was instructed by guards not to stand 
on either corner of her isolation cell, not to stand to the left or right of the toilet and sink, 
and not to stand within 2.5 feet of the door to the cell. 
She was told that if she did not comply with this directive,  she would receive a disciplinary sanction. 
In addition, she is not receiving food designated on the menu. 
Further, the discovery disc provided does not work on the MDC computer; and the computer 
reports multiple errors indicating it cannot accommodate disc. 
Consequently, a replacement disc and/or replacement computer is required. 
Please let us know of the status of hard drive containing complete production;

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
United States of America, 
—v—
Ghislaine Maxwell, 
Defendant. 
20-CR-330 (AJN) 
OPINION AND ORDER 
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell has been indicted by a grand jury on charges of conspiracy 
to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; enticing a 
minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2; conspiracy 
to transport minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; transporting 
minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2423 and 2; and two charges 
of perjury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1623. The Court held a lengthy bail hearing on July 14, 
2020. After extensive briefing and argument at the hearing, the Court concluded that the 
Defendant was a clear risk of flight and that no conditions or combination of conditions would 
ensure her appearance. Bail was therefore denied. 
The Defendant has now filed a renewed motion for release on bail pending trial, which 
the Government opposes. In her renewed motion, the Defendant attempts to respond to the 
reasons that the Court provided in denying bail and proposes a substantially larger bail package. 
But by and large, the arguments presented either were made at the initial bail hearing or could 
have been made then. In any event, the new information provided in the renewed application 
only solidifies the Court's view that the Defendant plainly poses a risk of flight and that no 
EFTA00013307
--- PAGE 2 ---
combination of conditions can ensure her appearance. This is so because: the charges, which 
carry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if 
convicted; the evidence proffered by the Government, including multiple corroborating and 
corroborated witnesses, is strong; the Defendant has substantial resources and foreign ties 
(including citizenship in a country that does not extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who 
lived in hiding and apart from the family to whom she now asserts important ties, has not been 
fully candid about her financial situation. Thus, for substantially the same reasons that the Court 
denied the Defendant's first motion for release on July 14, 2020, the Court DENIES the 
Defendant's renewed motion for release on bail.' 
I. 
Background 
On June 29, 2020, a grand jury in the Southern District of New York returned a six-count 
Indictment against the Defendant, charging her with facilitating Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse of 
multiple minor victims between approximately 1994 and 1997. See Dkt. No. 1. On July 2, 2020, 
the Indictment was unsealed, and that same day, the Defendant was arrested in New Hampshire. 
On July 8, 2020, the Government filed a Superseding Indictment, which contained only small 
ministerial corrections. Dkt. No. 17. 
On July 14, 2020, this Court held a hearing regarding the Defendant's request for bail. 
After a thorough consideration of all of the Defendant's arguments and of the factors set forth in 
U.S.C. § 3142(g), the Court concluded that no conditions or combination of conditions could 
reasonably assure the Defendant's appearance, determining as a result that the Defendant was a 
flight risk and that detention without bail was warranted under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(1). The 
' This Opinion & Order will be temporarily sealed in order to allow the parties to propose 
redactions to sensitive or confidential information. 
EFTA00013308

Defendant did not appeal the Court's determination that detention was required, and she has been 
incarcerated at the Metropolitan Detention Center since that time. 
IL 
Legal Standard 
Pretrial detainees have a right to bail under the Eighth Amendment to the United States 
Constitution, which prohibits the imposition of "[e]xcessive bail," and under the Bail Reform 
Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3141, et seq. The Bail Reform Act requires the Court to release a defendant 
"subject to the least restrictive further condition, or combination of conditions, that [it] 
determines will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any 
other person and the community." 18 U.S.C. § 3142(c)(1)(8). Only if, after considering the 
factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g), the Court concludes that "no condition or combination 
of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of 
any other person and the community," may the Court order that the defendant be held without 
bail. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(1). 
If there is probable cause to find that the defendant committed an offense specifically 
enumerated in § 3142(e)(3), a rebuttable presumption arises "that no condition or combination of 
conditions will reasonably assure" the defendant's appearance or the safety of the community or 
others. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(3). In such circumstances, "the defendant `bears a limited burden of 
production . . . to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that he does not pose 
a danger to the community or a risk of flight.'" United States v. English, 629 F.3d 311, 319 (2d 
Cir. 2011) (quoting United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2001)); see also 
United States v. Rodriguez, 950 F.2d 85, 88 (2d Cir. 1991) ("[A] defendant must introduce some 
evidence contrary to the presumed fact in order to rebut the presumption."). Nonetheless, "'the 
government retains the ultimate burden of persuasion by clear and convincing evidence that the 
EFTA00013309
--- PAGE 4 ---
defendant presents a danger to the community,' and `by the lesser standard of a preponderance of 
the evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight.' English, 629 F.3d at 319 (quoting 
Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436); see also United States v. Manly., 782 F.2d 1141, 1144 (2d Cir. 1986) 
("The government retains the burden of persuasion [in a presumption case]."). Even when "a 
defendant has met his burden of production," however, "the presumption favoring detention does 
not disappear entirely, but remains a factor to be considered among those weighed by the district 
court." United States v. Mattis, 963 F.3d 285, 290-91 (2d Cir. 2020). 
After a court has made an initial determination that no conditions of release can 
reasonably assure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Court may reopen the bail 
hearing if "information exists that was not known to the movant at the time of the hearing and 
that has a material bearing on the issue" of whether pretrial detention is warranted. 18 U.S.C. § 
3142(0. But the Court is not required to reopen the hearing or to conduct another hearing if it 
determines that any new information would not have a material bearing on the issue. See United 
States v. Raniere, No. 18-CR-2041 (NGG) (VMS), 2018 WL 6344202, at *2 n.7 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 
5, 2018) (noting that "[a]s the court has already held one detention hearing, it need not hold 
another" the standards set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3142(0(2) are met); United States v. Havens, 487 
F. Supp. 2d 335, 339 (W.D.N.Y. 2007) (electing not to reopen a detention hearing because the 
new information would not have changed the court's decision to detain the defendant until trial). 
III. 
Discussion 
The Defendant bases her renewed motion for bail on both 18 U.S.C. § 3142(0 and the 
Court's inherent powers to review its own bail decisions. See Def. Mot. at 7-9. As already 
noted, § 3142(0 provides that a bail hearing "may be reopened . . . at any time before trial if the 
judicial officer finds that information exists that was not known to the movant at the time of the 
EFTA00013310
--- PAGE 5 ---
hearing and that has a material bearing on the issue whether there are conditions of release that 
will reasonably assure the appearance of such person as required and the safety of any other 
person and the community." A court may also revisit its own decision pursuant to its inherent 
authority, even where the circumstances do not match § 3142(0's statutory text. See, e.g., 
United States v. Rowe, No. 02-CR-756 (LMM), 2003 WL 21196846, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. May 21, 
2003) (noting that "a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence proffered on 
reconsideration was known to the movant at the time of the original hearing."); United States v. 
Petrov, No. 15-CR-66 (LTS), 2015 WL 11022886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2015) (noting the 
"Court's inherent authority for reconsideration of the Court's previous bail decision"). 
In line with this, the Defendant's new motion aims to address the reasons that the Court 
provided when it originally determined that no conditions could reasonably assure her 
appearance and that pretrial detention was warranted. First, the Defendant proposes a more 
expansive set of bail conditions that she claims addresses any concerns regarding risk of flight. 
The newly proposed conditions include a $28.5 million bail package, which consists of a $22.5 
million personal recognizance bond co-signed by the Defendant and her spouse and secured by 
approximately $8 million in property and $500,000 in cash, along with six additional bonds—
five co-signed by the Defendant's friends and family members and the sixth posted by the 
security company that would provide security services to the Defendant if she were granted bail 
and transferred to home confinement. See Def. Mot. at 2. The proposed conditions also provide 
that the Defendant would be released to the custody of a family member, who would serve as her 
third-party custodian under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(c)(1)(B)(i); that she would be placed in home 
confinement with GPS monitoring and that her travel would be restricted to the Southern and 
Eastern Districts of New York and would be limited to appearances in Court, meetings with 
EFTA00013311
--- PAGE 6 ---
counsel, medical visits, and upon approval by the Court or Pretrial Services. Id. at 2-3. 
Furthermore, the Defendant would have on-premises security guards that she would pay for who 
would prevent her from leaving the residence at any time without prior approval by the Court or 
Pretrial Services and who would escort her when she is authorized to leave. Id. at 3. 
The motion also presents new information that, according to the Defendant, addresses the 
concerns that the Court articulated when it determined that detention was warranted. This newly 
presented information, most of which was available to the Defendant at the time of the initial bail 
hearing, includes evidence of the Defendant's family ties in the United States, see Def. Mot. at 
10-14; a detailed financial report that provides a more comprehensive outlook on the 
Defendant's financial conditions and assets, see id. at 15-18; evidence that according to her 
rebuts the Government's original contention that she attempted to evade law enforcement prior 
to her arrest, see id. at 18-25; waivers of her right to contest extradition from the United 
Kingdom and France, along with expert opinions claiming that the Defendant would not be able 
to resist extradition if she were to execute the waivers, see id. at 25-29; and evidence that she 
argues lays bare the weakness of the Government's case against her, see id. at 30-34. 
Finally, the Defendant argues that the conditions of her confinement, including as a result 
of the COVID-19 pandemic, present an additional factor favoring release. She claims that the 
conditions imposed are punitive and that those conditions interfere with her ability to participate 
in her defense, and she asserts that these factors further militate in favor of release. See id. at 34-
38. 
Having carefully considered all of the Defendant's arguments, the Court again concludes 
that no conditions or combination of conditions could reasonably assure her appearance and that 
EFTA00013312
--- PAGE 7 ---
detention without bail is warranted under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(I). The Court accordingly denies 
Defendant's request to reopen the original bail hearing and denies her renewed motion for bail. 
A. The presumption in favor of detention applies 
The Court is required to presume that no condition or combination of conditions of 
pretrial release will reasonably assure the Defendant's appearance. The Bail Reform Act 
provides that if a defendant is charged with committing an offense involving a minor victim 
under 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, "it shall be presumed that no condition or combination of 
conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of the 
community if the judicial officer finds that there is probable cause to believe that the person 
committed." 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(3)(E). The Defendant's indictment by a grand jury suffices to 
establish that there is probable cause to believe that she committed the offenses charged in the 
indictment. See, e.g., United States v. Contreras, 776 F.2d 51, 53-54 (2d Cir. 1985) (noting that 
that an indictment returned by a properly constituted grand jury "conclusively determines the 
existence of probable cause" and that "the return of an indictment eliminates the need for a 
preliminary examination at which a probable cause finding is made by a judicial officer pursuant 
to Rule 5(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure." (citations omitted)). In light of the 
crimes charged in the indictment, the Court begins with the presumption that no condition or 
combination of conditions of pretrial release will reasonably assure the Defendant's appearance. 
When the presumption applies, the Defendant bears a limited burden of production 
"tending to counter the § 3142(e) presumption of flight," Contreras, 776 F.2d at 53 n.1. The 
Defendant's burden of production only requires that she "introduce a certain amount of evidence 
contrary to the presumed fact." United States v. Jessup, 757 F.2d 378, 380 (1st Cir. 1985), 
EFTA00013313
--- PAGE 8 ---
abrogated on other grounds by United States v. O'Brien, 895 F.2d 810 (1st Cir. 1990). That 
burden is "limited." United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2001). The 
Defendant's proffer of evidence and information—including information relating to her financial 
conditions and her family ties to the United States, among other things—satisfies this limited 
burden. As the Court discussed at the July 14, 2020 hearing, these factors bear on the question 
of whether the Defendant poses a flight risk. And the evidence she advances in her renewed 
motion for bail reasonably disputes the presumption that she poses a flight risk. In that sense, 
this evidence is relevant to the ultimate determination and satisfies the relatively low threshold 
imposed by the burden of production. 
The presumption of flight does not disappear entirely, however, and it "remains a factor 
to be considered among those weighed by the district court." United States v. Mercedes, 254 
F.3d 433, 436 (2d Cir. 2001) (quoting Martir, 782 F.2d at 1144). As a result, "[a] judicial officer 
conducting a detention hearing should, even after a defendant has come forward with rebuttal 
evidence, continue to give the presumption of flight some weight by keeping in mind that 
Congress has found that these offenders pose special risks of flight, and that 'a strong probability 
arises' that no form of conditional release will be adequate to secure their appearance." Martir, 
782 F.2d at 1144 (citation omitted). 
B. The new information does not alter the Court's initial determination 
When determining whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the 
appearance of the person as required, courts are required to consider the factors outlined in 18 
U.S.C. § 3I42(g). Thus, the Court considers (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense 
charged, including whether the offense involves a minor victim, (2) the weight of the evidence, 
(3) the defendant's history and characteristics, and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to 
EFTA00013314
--- PAGE 9 ---
any person or the community posed by pre-trial release. See Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436; see also 
U.S.C. § 3I42(g). 
At the July 14, 2020 bail hearing, the Court considered these factors before concluding 
that no conditions of release could reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required. 
And the first and fourth factors remain unchanged. As already noted, the Defendant is charged 
with offenses involving minor victims, and it is undisputed that the nature and circumstances of 
the offenses charged in the Superseding Indictment weighs in favor of continued detention. On 
the other hand, the Government has not advanced any evidence that the Defendant poses a 
danger to any person or to the community, a factor that weighs against detention. The 
Defendant's arguments therefore focus on the second and third factors. 
As explained below, neither the arguments put forth in the Defendant's renewed motion 
for bail nor the evidence she submitted in conjunction with her motion rebut the Court's 
conclusions, and the Court continues to find, after again applying these factors, that no 
conditions of release will reasonably assure the Defendant's appearance at future proceedings. 
1. The Weight of the Evidence 
The Court will address the strength of the Government's case first. The Defendant 
argues that the Government lacks any meaningful documentary corroboration of the witness 
testimony and that the discovery produced to date has included only a "small number of 
documents from the time period of the conspiracy." Def. Mot. at 5. And she claims, as a result, 
that the Government overstated the strength of its case in advance of the July 14, 2020 bail 
hearing. See id. at 30-33. So she argues that the second § 3142(g) factor supports release. 
The Court disagrees. Arguing that the case against her "is based almost exclusively on 
the recollections of the three accusers, who remain unidentified," the Defendant contends that the 
EFTA00013315
--- PAGE 10 ---
weight of the evidence is weak. Def. Reply at 2. But she too easily discredits the witness 
testimony. According to the Government, and as reflected in the indictment, it is anticipated that 
the three witnesses will provide detailed and corroborating accounts of the Defendant's alleged 
role in enticing minors to engage in sex acts. See Gov't Opp'n at 10; see also Dkt. No. 17, SI 
Superseding Indictment, ¶¶ 7, II, 13, 17. Moreover, the Government proffers that additional 
evidence, including flight records and other witnesses' corroborating testimony, will further 
support the main witnesses' testimony and link the Defendant to Epstein's conduct. Gov't 
Opp'n at 10-11. And while the Defendant contends that much of this evidence focuses on 
Epstein, not the Defendant, the nature of the conspiracy charge (along with the evidence linking 
the Defendant to Epstein) renders this evidence relevant to the Government's charges against 
her. As the Court stated in the July 14,2020 hearing, although the Court does not prejudge the 
merits of the Government's case or of the Defendant's defenses, for purposes of the bail 
determination stage, the Government's proffered case against the Defendant remains strong. See 
Dkt. No. 93 ("Tr.") at 83:4-83:10. The Court again concludes that the Defendant's awareness of 
the potential strength of the government's case against her creates a risk of flight, and none of the 
Defendant's new arguments meaningfully alter that conclusion. As a result, the second factor 
supports detention. 
2. The Defendant's History and Characteristics 
At the July 14,2020 bail hearing, the Court determined that the Defendant was a flight 
risk in part because of her substantial international ties, including multiple foreign citizenships 
and familial and personal connections abroad and her ownership of at least one foreign property 
of significant value. See Tr. at 83:13-83:18. And the Court further noted that the Defendant's 
extraordinary financial resources could provide her the means to flee the country even despite 
EFTA00013316
--- PAGE 11 ---
COVID-19 related travel restrictions. Id. at 83:21-83:25. The Court also observed that the 
Defendant had family and personal connections to the United States but concluded that the 
absence of any dependents, significant family ties, or employment in the United States also 
supported the conclusion that flight would not pose an insurmountable burden for her. Id. at 
84:4-84:9. While the Defendant's renewed motion for bail addresses some of these factors, it 
does not alter the Court's conclusion. 
The first few considerations remain relatively unchanged. The Defendant continues to 
have substantial international ties and multiple foreign citizenships, and she continues to have 
familial and personal connections abroad. None of the evidence presented in support of the 
present motion fundamentally alters those conclusions. To address the Court's concern that the 
Defendant's French citizenship presented the opportunity that she could flee to France and that 
she would be able to resist extradition on that basis, see Tr. at 83:1843:20, the Defendant now 
offers to waive her right to extradition from both the United Kingdom and France, along with 
expert opinions reports claiming that such waivers would likely make it possible to resist an 
extradition request from the United States to either country. See Def. Mot., Exs. T, U, V. As the 
Government points out in its brief, however, the legal weight of the waivers is, at best, contested. 
The French Ministry of Justice, for instance, indicated in a letter submitted in conjunction to the 
Government's opposition that the French Code of Criminal Procedure "absolutely prohibits" the 
extradition of a French national. See Gov't Opp'n, Ex. B. And while the Defendant's own 
expert attempts to rebut the Ministry of Justice's letter, see Def. Reply, Ex. A, even the 
Defendant's own experts use probabilistic, rather than absolute, language, leaving open the 
possibility that extradition would be blocked. See, e.g., Def. Mot., Ex. U at 2 ("On the basis of 
the information currently known, it is highly unlikely that Ghislaine Maxwell would be able 
EFTA00013317
--- PAGE 12 ---
successfully to resist extradition to the United States in relation to the charges in the superseding 
indictment dated 7 July 2020."); Def. Mot., Ex. V ¶ 76 ("It would ... become a matter for the 
French government to decide on whether or not to issue an extradition decree against Ms. 
Ghislaine Maxwell."); id. ¶ 77 ("[I]t is highly unlikely that the French government would refuse 
to issue and execute an extradition decree against Ms Maxwell. . . ."). Nor has the Defendant 
presented any cases where courts addressed the question of whether an anticipatory waiver of 
extradition is enforceable; while she cites cases where defendants offered to waive extradition, 
the reasoning in those cases turned on other factors and the courts did not dwell on the 
enforceability of such waivers. See, e.g., United States v. Grillo, No. 99-1514, 1999 WL 
1456536, at *2 (3d Cir. July 13, 1999); United States v. Salvagno, 314 F. Supp. 2d 115, 119 
(N.D.N.Y. 2004); United States v. Karni, 298 F. Supp. 2d 129, 132-33 (D.D.C. 2004); United 
States v. Chen, 820 F. Supp. 1205, 1212 (N.D. Cal. 1992). In those cases, the courts included 
such waivers as one among several conditions of release, but they did not make any express 
determination that such waivers are enforceable. On the other hand, some courts have expressly 
opined that such waivers are unenforceable. See, e.g., United States v. Epstein, 425 F. Supp. 3d 
306, 325 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (describing the "Defense proposal to give advance consent to 
extradition and waiver of extradition rights" as "an empty gesture."); United States v. Morrison, 
No. 16-MR-I 18, 2016 WL 7421924, at *4 (W.D.N.Y. Dec. 23, 2016) ("Although the defendants 
have signed a waiver of extradition, such a waiver may not become valid until an extradition 
request is pending in Canada and may be subject to withdrawal."); United States v. Stroh, No. 
396-CR-139 (AHN), 2000 WL 1832956, at *5 (D. Conn. Nov. 3, 2000) ("[I]t appears that there 
is a substantial legal question as to whether any country to which he fled would enforce any 
waiver of extradition signed under the circumstances presented in this case. At any event, 
EFTA00013318
--- PAGE 13 ---
extradition from Israel (or any other country) would be, at best, a difficult and lengthy process 
and, at worst, impossible."). 
Having carefully reviewed the experts' reports and the cases cited by the Defendant,2 the 
Court's analysis of the relationship between the Defendant's French citizenship and the risk of 
flight remains fundamentally unchanged. Its reasoning is guided in part by the substantial legal 
questions regarding the legal weight of anticipatory extradition waivers and the likelihood that 
any extradition would be a difficult and lengthy process (including, for instance, the likelihood 
that the Defendant would contest the validity of those waivers and the duration it would take to 
resolve those legal disputes). The likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any 
extradition requests—even if she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition 
entirely—weighs strongly in favor of detention. 
In addition, the Defendant's extraordinary financial resources also continue to provide 
her the means to flee the country and to do so undetected. To be sure, this factor alone does not 
by itself justify continued detention. But as the Court noted at the initial bail hearing, the 
Defendant's financial resources, in combination with her substantial international ties and 
foreign connections and her experience avoiding detection (whether from the government, the 
press, or otherwise), do bear significantly on the flight risk analysis. See Tr. at 88:6-88:23 
(distinguishing this case from United States v. Esposito, 309 F. Supp. 3d 24 (S.D.N.Y. 2018), 
The Defendant also argues that "a defendant's waiver of the right to appeal an extradition order 
has been recognized as an indication of the defendant's intent not to flee." Def. Mot. at 27 
(citing United States v. Khashoggi, 717 F. Supp. 1048, 1052 (S.D.N.Y. 1989)). The Court places 
little weight on this argument. Under the Defendant's theory, a defendant could strategically 
offer to waive the right to extradition while intending to resist any subsequent extradition that 
might result. The Court is unpersuaded. 
EFTA00013319
--- PAGE 14 ---
United States v. Dreier, 596 F. Supp. 2d 831 (S.D.N.Y. 2009), and United States v. Madoff 586 
F. Supp. 2d 240 (S.D.N.Y. 2009)). 
The Court's concerns regarding the absence of any dependents, significant family ties, or 
employment in the United States, meanwhile, apply with somewhat less force in light of the 
evidence submitted in support of this motion. See id. at 84:4-84:9. The Defendant has 
submitted a litany of letters of support written by friends and family members. See Def. Mot., 
Exs. A—N, W—X. These letters, according to the Defendant, support her claim that she has 
significant ties to the United States and attest to the Defendant's character. The Defendant 
places particular emphasis on the letter written by her spouse, whose identity and connection to 
the Defendant was withheld from the Court at the initial bail hearing. See Def. Mot. at 11-13. 
In that letter, her spouse expounds on the lives they led before her arrest, noting in particular that 
the Government's characterization of the Defendant's "transient" lifestyle, Dkt. No. 4 at 9, was 
belied by the "quiet family life" that they had enjoyed. Def. Mot. at 11; see also Def. Mot, Ex. A 
1114-5. Other letters similarly highlight that the Defendant's family and affective ties in the 
United States are stronger than was originally presented to the Court in the initial bail hearing. 
These letters substantiate the Defendant's claim that she has important ties to people in 
the United States, but they leave unaltered the Court's conclusion that flight would not pose an 
insurmountable burden for the Defendant. Among other things, the Defendant now argues that 
her newly revealed relationship with her spouse signals her deep affective ties in the country, but 
at the time she was arrested, she was not living with him and claimed to be getting divorced. See 
Pretrial Services Report at 3. Indeed, she does not propose to live with him were she to be 
released on bail, undercutting her argument that that relationship would create an insurmountable 
burden to her fleeing. Furthermore, the fact that she has friends and family in the United States 
EFTA00013320
--- PAGE 15 ---
does not mean that those people would be unable to visit her were she to flee to another country. 
In addition, the Defendant continues to lack any employment ties to the United States—another 
factor weighing in favor of detention. Furthermore, it is apparent from the letters that the 
Defendant has significant ties to family and friends abroad. In light of this, nothing in the 
renewed motion for bail alters the Court's fundamental conclusion that flight would not pose an 
insurmountable burden to the Defendant. 
Other factors that similarly speak to the Defendant's history and characteristics weigh in 
favor of detention. Most notably, the Defendant's pattern of providing incomplete or erroneous 
information to the Court or to Pretrial Services bears significantly on the Court's application of 
the third factor to the present case. Among other things, in July 2020 the Defendant represented 
to Pretrial Services that she possessed around $3.5 million worth of assets (while leaving out her 
spouse's assets and assets that had been transferred to trust accounts) and the representation that 
the New Hampshire property was owned by a corporation and that she was "just able to stay 
there." See Pretrial Services Report at 2. The Defendant now claims that she "was detained at 
the time and had no access to her financial records and was trying to piece together these 
numbers from memory. According to the Macalvins report, [the financial figures] are a close 
approximation of the value of the assets that Ms. Maxwell held in her own name at the time of 
her arrest.... For the reasons already discussed, Ms. Maxwell was reluctant to discuss anything 
about her [spouse] and expressed that to Pretrial Services." Def. Mot. at 16 n.5. Even if the 
Defendant was unable to provide an exact number, however, the difference between the number 
she originally reported to Pretrial Services and the number now presented to the Court in the 
Macalvins report, a report on the Defendant's finances prepared by a prominent accounting firm 
for purposes of this motion, see Def. Mot., Ex. O, makes it unlikely that the misrepresentation 
EFTA00013321
--- PAGE 16 ---
was the result of the Defendant's misestimation rather than misdirection. And while the 
Defendant's concerns regarding her spouse's privacy are not insignificant, she fails to furnish 
any explanation as to why those concerns led her to misrepresent key facts to Pretrial Services 
and, by extension, the Court. In sum, the evidence of a lack of candor is, if anything, stronger 
now than in July 2020, as it is clear to the Court that the Defendant's representations to Pretrial 
Services were woefully incomplete. That lack of candor raises significant concerns as to 
whether the Court has now been provided a full and accurate picture of her finances and as to the 
Defendant's willingness to abide by any set of conditions of release. 
For the reasons stated above, the Court concludes that the third factor continues to weigh 
in favor of detention. 
C. Pretrial detention continues to be warranted 
In light of the reasons stated above, the Government has again met its burden of 
persuasion by "a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight." 
English, 629 F.3d at 319 (quoting Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436). Taking the § 3142(g) factors into 
account, the Court concludes that the presumption in favor of detention, the nature and 
characteristics of the charged offenses, the weight of the evidence, and the history and 
characteristics of the Defendant all weigh in favor of detention. Along similar lines, the 
Government has also shown, and the Court concludes for the reasons outlined below, that the 
Defendant's proposed bail package cannot reasonably assure her appearance. Thus, the Court's 
original conclusion that the Defendant poses a flight risk and that no set of conditions can 
reasonably assure her future appearance remains unaltered. 
As already noted, the Defendant now proposes a $28.5 million bail package, which 
includes a $22.5 million personal recognizance bond co-signed by the Defendant and her spouse 
EFTA00013322
--- PAGE 17 ---
and secured by approximately $8 million in property and $500,000 in cash, along with six 
additional bonds—five co-signed by the Defendant's friends and family members and the sixth 
posted by the security company that would provide security services to the Defendant if she were 
granted bail and transferred to home confinement. See Def. Mot. at 2. At the initial hearing, the 
Court noted that the opaqueness of the Defendant's finances rendered it difficult to set financial 
bail conditions that could reasonably assure her appearance in court. The financial information 
that the Defendant presented to the Court at the initial bail hearing was undisputedly incomplete, 
and as the Court noted, the Court lacked "a clear picture of Ms. Maxwell's finances and the 
resources available to her." Tr. at 86-87. 
The Defendant has now presented to the Court what is perhaps a more thorough report on 
her finances prepared by Macalvins, an accounting firm in the United Kingdom. Macalvins 
analyzed the Defendant's assets and finances for the past five years, basing its analysis on, 
among other things, bank statements, tax returns, and FBAR filings, providing a summary of 
the assets held by the Defendant and her spouse as well as the assets held in trust for the 
benefit of the Defendant for the period stemming from 2015 to 2020. See Def. Mot., Ex. O. 
In addition, the Defendant retained a Certified Fraud Examiner and a former IRS Special 
Agent, who reviewed the Macalvins report and the underlying documents and determined that 
report accurately represents the assets held by the Defendant and her spouse. See Def. Mot., Ex. 
P. The Defendant's new bail proposal is based on the numbers derived from the Macalvins 
report. 
But even assuming that the financial report provides an accurate analysis of the 
Defendant's finances, the Court is unpersuaded by her argument that the bail package reasonably 
assures her appearance. As the Government argues, the bail package would leave unrestrained 
EFTA00013323
--- PAGE 18 ---
millions of dollars and other assets that she could sell in order to support herself. See Gov't 
Opp'n at 23. Furthermore, the proposed bond is only partially secured. Taking into account the 
vast amounts of wealth left relatively unrestrained by the bail package, that amount, standing 
alone, cannot reasonably assure that she would appear before the Court. Nor is the Court's 
conclusion altered by the fact that a number of third parties have pledged to support her bond; 
the amount of wealth that she would retain were she to flee, in addition to contingent assets and 
future income streams that are not accounted for in the bail package, would plausibly enable her 
to compensate them, in part or in full, for their losses. And while the Defendant argues that she 
has procured "significant loans on the basis of a negative pledge" over a property and that $4 
million is invested in an "illiquid hedge fund that could only be liquidated with considerable 
difficulty," see Def. Reply at 6, these arguments do not alter the Court's ultimate conclusion 
that the financial package does not meaningfully mitigate the possibility of flight. 
The proposed conditions also provide that the Defendant would be released to the 
custody of a family member, who would serve as the Defendant's third-party custodian under 18 
U.S.C. § 3142(c)(1)(B)(i); that the Defendant would be placed in home confinement with GPS 
monitoring and that her travel would be restricted to the Southern and Eastern Districts of New 
York and would be limited to appearances in Court, meetings with counsel, medical visits, and 
upon approval by the Court or Pretrial Services; that she would be under the strict supervision of 
Pretrial Services; and that she would surrender all travel documents. Id. at 2-3. Furthermore, 
the Defendant would have on-premises security guards who would prevent her from leaving the 
residence at any time without prior approval by the Court or Pretrial Services and who would 
escort her when she is authorized to leave. Id. at 3. 
EFTA00013324
--- PAGE 19 ---
None of these conditions would reasonably assure the Defendant's appearance. Here, 
too, the Court's original determination applies with equal force. As the Court noted at the 
original hearing, the Defendant has demonstrated an extraordinary capacity to evade detection, 
"[e]ven in the face of what the Defense has acknowledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to 
locate her." Tr. at 87:4-87:19. Indeed, regardless of whether the Defendant sought to evade the 
press, rather than law enforcement, in the months leading up to her arrest, her sophistication in 
evading detection reveals the futility of relying on any conditions, including GPS monitoring, 
restrictive home confinement, and private security guards, to secure her appearance. See Tr. at 
87:4-88:2. As other courts have observed, "home detention with electronic monitoring does not 
prevent flight; at best, it limits a fleeing defendant's head start." United States v. Zarger, No. 00-
CR-773-S-1 (JG), 2000 WL 1134364, at *I (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2000). Furthermore, while the 
Defendant now represents that she would be released to the custody of a family member, who 
would serve as the Defendant's third-party custodian under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(c)(1)(B)(i), and 
that she secured a residence in the Eastern District of New York, see Def. Mot. at 3, that does not 
outweigh the other significant factors weighing in favor of detention. And finally, the 
Defendant's argument that private security guards could ensure her appearance at future 
proceedings runs afoul of the Bail Reform Act, which the Second Circuit has held "does not 
permit a two-tiered bail system in which defendants of lesser means are detained pending trial 
while wealthy defendants are released to self-funded private jails." United States v. Boustani, 
932 F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir. 2019). As in Boustani, the Defendant in the present case would be 
detained regardless of her wealth, and "if a similarly situated defendant of lesser means would be 
detained, a wealthy defendant cannot avoid detention by relying on his personal funds to pay for 
private detention." Id. 
EFTA00013325
--- PAGE 20 ---
In light of the above, the Court again concludes that the Government has shown by a 
preponderance of the evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight and that the 
Defendant's proposed conditions are insufficient to reasonably assure her appearance. The 
presumption in favor of detention, the weight of the evidence, and the history and characteristics 
of the Defendant all support that conclusion, and none of Defendant's new arguments change the 
Court's original determination. 
D. The Defendant's conditions of confinement do not justify release 
Lastly, the Court is unpersuaded by the Defendant's argument that the conditions of her 
confinement are uniquely onerous, interfere with her ability to participate in her defense, and 
thus justify release. See Def. Mot. at 35-38. Indeed, the Defendant does not meaningfully 
dispute that she has received "more time than any other inmate at the MDC to review her 
discovery and as much, if not more, time to communicate with her attorneys." Gov't Opp'n at 
29. To the extent that the Defendant has concerns regarding some of the measures taken by 
BOP, including a recent lockdown due to COVID-19 that curtailed in-person legal visitations, 
the Defendant provides no authority to conclude that this, standing alone, violates her 
constitutional right to participate in her defense. And while the Court acknowledges the 
Defendant's concerns regarding the conditions of her confinement, the Defendant has failed to 
provide any basis to conclude that release is warranted on those grounds—even after the Court 
has determined that she continues to pose a flight risk.3
The Court will continue to ensure that the Defendant has the ability to speak and meet regularly 
with her attorneys and to review all necessary discovery materials to prepare for her defense. 
Defense counsel shall confer with the Government on any specific requests. To the extent they 
are not reasonably accommodated, an application may be made to the Court. 
EFTA00013326
--- PAGE 21 ---
Finally, as the Court expressed at the initial bail hearing, it has deep concerns about the 
spread of COVID-19 at BOP facilities, including at the MDC. Indeed, in recent weeks, the 
incidence of COVID-19 among the inmate population where the Defendant is housed is truly 
alarming. See COVID-19: Coronavirus, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, https://www.bop.gov/ 
coronavirus/ (last visited Dec. 28, 2020) (noting that the MDC currently has 99 inmates and 11 
staff members who have tested positive for COVID-19). It could be argued that in the face of 
this, only those defendants who pose a danger to the community ought to be detained pending 
trial. If that were the law and in light of the increasing positivity rate, the Court would not 
hesitate to reopen the detention hearing and release the Defendant on bail since the Government 
rests none of its arguments on dangerousness. But that is not the law. Moreover, as the Court 
found at the initial bail hearing, the Defendant has no underlying health conditions that put her at 
heightened risk of health impacts were she to contract COVID. The pandemic, including 
increasing positivity numbers in the MDC, is not a basis for release in this case where the Court 
finds that the Defendant poses a substantial and actual risk of flight and that no combination of 
conditions could reasonably assure her appearance. 
E A hearing is unnecessary 
Having carefully reviewed the parties' arguments, the Court determines that a hearing is 
unnecessary and that it can resolve the motion on the papers. The briefing from both sides 
comprehensively lays out the parties' respective arguments For the reasons stated above, none 
of the new information has a material bearing on the Court's determination that the Defendant 
poses a flight risk. Indeed, many of the reasons that the Court provided at the July 14, 2020 
hearing continue to apply with equal, if not greater, force. The Court need not hold another 
EFTA00013327
--- PAGE 22 ---
hearing to evaluate Maxwell's motion, and it declines to do so. See United States v. Raniere, No. 
18-CR-2041 (NGG) (VMS), 2018 WL 6344202, at *2 n.7 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 5, 2018). 
IV. 
Conclusion 
Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell's renewed motion for release on bail, Dkt. No. 97, is 
DENIED. 
SO ORDERED.

Hey everyone: Here's the latest draft of our letter and declaration on this issue. We are still 
confirming a few things, but they shouldn't impact the substance of the Maxwell discussion. There is 
also a chance that there's a separate declaration from the MDC; if there is, it should contain the same 
substance re: Maxwell that's in the attached draft. 
Our response is due tomorrow. I'm generally around later this evening or tomorrow if there's 
anything you'd like to discuss. 
Thanks very much.

Subject: RE: Disparities in Counsel and Discovery Access for Ghislaine Maxwell and Justin Rivera 
: We are in the process of finalizing our response to the Maxwell/Rivera issue. We intend to 
explain that the discovery and counsel access accommodations that have been provided to Maxwell 
and Rivera, respectively, result from the specific circumstances of their cases, the specific requests of 
their lawyers, and their individual housing circumstances. On all of these factors, there are several 
important differences, including: 
EFTA00013329
--- PAGE 2 ---
- 
The Maxwell case has multiple times more discovery than the Rivera case. Hence, the need for 
such expanded discovery access is greater in the Maxwell case. 
- 
At the MDC, Maxwell has a unique housing situation, as she is in protective custody outside the 
general population. She therefore has sole access to a room to use a computer and phone for 
approximately 13 hours a day. Rivera, by contrast, is housed in the general population. 
- 
There are approximately 8o other inmates at the MCC in Rivera's unit that use the same VTC 
room for court appearances, probation interviews, and attorney meetings. By contrast, Maxwell 
shares access to the MDC VTC room with substantially fewer inmates. The MDC can therefore 
provide 15 hours of VTC meetings with her attorneys without compromising access for other 
MDC inmates. The same is not true for Rivera at the MCC. 
Going forward, even though Rivera's counsel have asked (and the Court has ordered) that Rivera 
receive three hours of laptop access each day, the MCC is now leaving the laptop with him all day long, 
and only takes it back at night to charge it. Therefore, the MCC is now providing the same amount of 
electronic discovery access to Rivera that Maxwell receives at the MDC. 
As for providing Rivera with up to 15 hours of VTC access, we will explain that doing so will 
compromise access for other inmates. If defense counsel expresses a need for additional time, the 
MCC will continue to find ways to accommodate those requests as best as they can. 
Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss this further.

Thanks, 
Can you keep me posted on what we think will be the substance of the draft declaration when you know 
(that is, before we are submitting anything on 12/31)? And how much of this is attributable to differences between MCC 
and MDC, as well as specific differences in their housing situations?

I wanted to bring to your attention a recent issue that's surfaced in United States v. Rivera et al., a sex 
trafficking case pending before Judge Engelmayer. As I'll describe in more detail below, Judge 
Engelmayer has asked us to submit a declaration from the BOP explaining why the discovery and 
counsel access accommodations provided to Ghislaine Maxwell (detained at the MDC outside the 
general population) cannot be extended to Justin Rivera (detained at the MCC in the general 
population). 
Justin Rivera was charged in February 2019 with sex trafficking conspiracy. He's been detained at the 
MCC since April 2019 on consent (he's also serving a state sentence). His trial, which was originally 
scheduled for April 2019, is expected to start on February 16, 2020. In July 2020, he had new counsel 
appointed, citing an irreconcilable breakdown with his former counsel. 
Since this fall, Judge Engelmayer has become increasingly frustrated with the MCC's treatment of 
Rivera. In particular, he's cited their failure to provide Rivera with adequate accommodations to 
review discovery and meet with his lawyers, who refuse to visit Rivera at the MCC for personal health 
concerns. We have two court orders in place to address these issues: (0 a laptop order, which requires 
the MCC to provide Rivera access to a laptop for three hours per day; and (2) a videoconference order, 
which requires the MCC to make available four hours of videoconferencing each week, in addition to 
any telephone or videoconference calls obtained through the Federal Defenders. 
At the moment, there's not a concern, at least from Judge Engelmayer, that the amount of time Rivera 
has for videoconferences and electronic discovery review is insufficient for trial preparation, although 
defense counsel has stated that they may request more time in the future. However, in a letter last 
night and during a court conference this morning (transcript attached), defense counsel cited the 
accommodations that the MDC has provided to Maxwell, describing them as "strikingly different and 
far superior" to those afforded to Rivera. Defense counsel further suggested that Rivera was being 
treated differently on account of his race, gender and class. Judge Engelmayer stated that the 
disparity in access "jumped off the page" and that the optics were "terrible," and asked us toe lain 
the rationale for the differing treatment. After conferring with 
and 
before 
our conference, we explained our understanding that the disparity comes down to the fact that 
Maxwell and Rivera have very different housing situations, with Maxwell's situation being more 
amenable to greater access to electronic discovery review and legal visits. 
Judge Engelmayer asked us to submit a declaration, from an appropriate person at the BOP, 
explaining in more detail why the accommodations provided to Maxwell cannot be extended to Rivera. 
Based on the recent bail opposition in the Maxwell case, I believe the differences in counsel/discovery 
access are as follows: 
Accommodation 
Maxwell 
Rivera 
Review of electronic 
discovery (NB: each 
defendant has laptop access) 
hours per day/7 days per 
week (91 hours total) 
hours per day/7 days per 
week (21 hours total) 
Counsel visits (by video) 
hours per day/5 days per 
week (15 hours total) 
Four hours per week (plus an 
additional two hours 
scheduled through the 
Federal Defenders) (6 hours 
total) 
Weekend legal calls 
As needed 
Not available 
EFTA00013331
--- PAGE 4 ---
The declaration is due by December 31. Because Judge Engelmayer's request implicates at least two 
criminal cases, and potentially the ongoing civil litigation with the MCC, we wanted to make sure that 
you were all aware of this issue.  We are also happ to set up a call to discuss this further. In the 
meantime, we are working with 
to identify the appropriate declarant and draft an 
explanation for the Court.

Thanks, 
. Can you keep me posted on what we think will be the substance of the draft declaration when you 
know (that is, before we are submitting anything on 12/31)? And how much of this is attributable to differences 
between MCC and MDC, as well as specific differences in their housing situations?

Subject: Disparities in Counsel and Discovery Access for Ghislaine Maxwell and Justin Rivera 
All: 
I wanted to bring to your attention a recent issue that's surfaced in United States v. Rivera et al., a 
sex trafficking case pending before Judge Engelmayer. As I'll describe in more detail below, Judge 
Engelmayer has asked us to submit a declaration from the BOP explaining why the discovery and 
counsel access accommodations provided to Ghislaine Maxwell (detained at the MDC outside the 
general population) cannot be extended to Justin Rivera (detained at the MCC in the general 
population). 
Justin Rivera was charged in February 2019 with sex trafficking conspiracy. He's been detained at 
the MCC since April 2019 on consent (he's also serving a state sentence). His trial, which was 
originally scheduled for April 2019, is expected to start on February 16, 2020. In July 2020, he had 
new counsel appointed, citing an irreconcilable breakdown with his former counsel. 
Since this fall, Judge Engelmayer has become increasingly frustrated with the MCC's treatment of 
Rivera. In particular, he's cited their failure to provide Rivera with adequate accommodations to 
review discovery and meet with his lawyers, who refuse to visit Rivera at the MCC for personal health 
concerns. We have two court orders in place to address these issues: (1) a laptop order, which 
requires the MCC to provide Rivera access to a laptop for three hours per day; and (2) a 
videoconference order, which requires the MCC to make available four hours of videoconferencing 
each week, in addition to any telephone or videoconference calls obtained through the Federal 
Defenders. 
At the moment, there's not a concern, at least from Judge Engelmayer, that the amount of time 
Rivera has for videoconferences and electronic discovery review is insufficient for trial preparation, 
EFTA00013335
--- PAGE 4 ---
although defense counsel has stated that they may request more time in the future. However, in a 
letter last night and during a court conference this morning (transcript attached), defense counsel 
cited the accommodations that the MDC has provided to Maxwell, describing them as "strikingly 
different and far superior" to those afforded to Rivera. Defense counsel further suggested that Rivera 
was being treated differently on account of his race, gender and class. Judge Engelmayer stated that 
the disparity in access "jumped off the page" and that the optics were "terrible," and asked us to 
e lain the rationale for the differing treatment. After conferring with 
and 
before our conference, we explained our understanding that the disparity comes down to 
the fact that Maxwell and Rivera have very different housing situations, with Maxwell's situation 
being more amenable to greater access to electronic discovery review and legal visits. 
Judge Engelmayer asked us to submit a declaration, from an appropriate person at the BOP, 
explaining in more detail why the accommodations provided to Maxwell cannot be extended to 
Rivera. Based on the recent bail opposition in the Maxwell case, I believe the differences in 
counsel/discovery access are as follows: 
Accommodation 
Maxwell 
Rivera 
Review of electronic 
discovery (NB: each 
defendant has laptop access) 
hours per day/7 days per 
week (91 hours total) 
hours per day/7 days per 
week (21 hours total) 
Counsel visits (by video) 
hours per day/5 days per 
week (15 hours total) 
Four hours per week (plus an 
additional two hours 
scheduled through the 
Federal Defenders) (6 hours 
total) 
Weekend legal calls 
As needed 
Not available 
The declaration is due by December 31. Because Judge Engelmayer's request implicates at least two 
criminal cases, and potentially the ongoing civil litigation with the MCC, we wanted to make sure that 
you were all aware of this issue. We are also ha 
to set up a call to discuss this further. In the 
meantime, we are working with 
to identify the appropriate declarant and draft an 
explanation for the Court.

Subject: RE: Disparities in Counsel and Discovery Access for Ghislaine Maxwell and Justin Rivera 
(USANYS) 
We are in the process of finalizing our response to the Maxwell/Rivera issue. We intend to 
explain that the discovery and counsel access accommodations that have been provided to Maxwell 
and Rivera, respectively, result from the specific circumstances of their cases, the specific requests 
EFTA00013338
--- PAGE 3 ---
of their lawyers, and their individual housing circumstances. On all of these factors, there are 
several important differences, including: 
The Maxwell case has multiple times more discovery than the Rivera case. Hence, the need 
for such expanded discovery access is greater in the Maxwell case. 
At the MDC, Maxwell has a unique housing situation, as she is in protective custody outside 
the general population. She therefore has sole access to a room to use a computer and phone 
for approximately 13 hours a day. Rivera, by contrast, is housed in the general population. 
There are approximately 8o other inmates at the MCC in Rivera's unit that use the same 
VTC room for court appearances, probation interviews, and attorney meetings. By contrast, 
Maxwell shares access to the MDC VTC room with substantially fewer inmates. The MDC 
can therefore provide 15 hours of VTC meetings with her attorneys without compromising 
access for other MDC inmates. The same is not true for Rivera at the MCC. 
Going forward, even though Rivera's counsel have asked (and the Court has ordered) that Rivera 
receive three hours of laptop access each day, the MCC is now leaving the laptop with him all day 
long, and only takes it back at night to charge it. Therefore, the MCC is now providing the same 
amount of electronic discovery access to Rivera that Maxwell receives at the MDC. 
As for providing Rivera with up to 15 hours of VTC access, we will explain that doing so will 
compromise access for other inmates. If defense counsel expresses a need for additional time, the 
MCC will continue to find ways to accommodate those requests as best as they can. 
Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss this further.

STATEMENT ON DOJ OFFICE OF PROFESSIONAL 
RESPONSIBILITY REPORT ON JEFFREY EPSTEIN 2006-
EFTA00013355
--- PAGE 2 ---
2008 INVESTIGATION 
WASHINGTON — The executive summary of a report by the Department of 
Justice's Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) was released today to 
affected victims. The summary, which is available on the Justice Department 
website, provides the essential details about the findings of OPR's investigation 
into the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida's resolution of 
its 2006-2008 federal criminal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein and its 
interactions with victims during the investigation. 
While OPR did not find that Department attorneys engaged in professional 
misconduct, OPR concluded that the victims were not treated with the 
forthrightness and sensitivity expected by the Department. OPR also concluded 
that former U.S. Attorney Acosta exercised poor judgment by deciding to resolve 
the federal investigation through the non-prosecution agreement and when he 
failed to make certain that the state of Florida intended to and would notify 
victims identified through the federal investigation about the state plea hearing. 
In order to fully respect the rights and dignity of Jeffrey Epstein's many victims, 
the Department first invited victims and their legal representatives to be briefed 
this morning on the report's contents. The Privacy Act prohibits the Department 
from releasing the full report publicly, but permits the report to be disclosed upon 
request to a congressional committee with jurisdiction over the matter, and this 
has been done. 
We salute the courage of survivors as they again are confronted with these 
horrible crimes and their aftermath. The Department will thoroughly review the 
report, which will inform our implementation of the Crime Victims Rights' Act 
and the Attorney General's Guidelines on Victim and Witness Assistance.

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE 
OFFICE OF 
PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF REPORT 
Investigation into the 
U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida's 
Resolution of Its 2006-2008 Federal Criminal Investigation of 
Jeffrey Epstein and Its Interactions with Victims during the Investigation 
November 2020 
EFTA00013359
--- PAGE 2 ---
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
The Department of Justice (Department) Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) 
investigated allegations that in 2007-2008, prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the 
Southern District of Florida (USAO) improperly resolved a federal investigation into the criminal 
conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by negotiating and executing a federal non-prosecution agreement 
(NPA). The NPA was intended to end a federal investigation into allegations that Epstein engaged 
in illegal sexual activity with girls.' OPR also investigated whether USAO prosecutors committed 
professional misconduct by failing to consult with victims of Epstein's crimes before the NPA was 
signed or by misleading victims regarding the status of the federal investigation after the signing. 
I. 
OVERVIEW OF FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
The Palm Beach (Florida) Police Department (PBPD) began investigating Jeffrey Epstein 
in 2005, after the parents of a 14-year-old girl complained that Epstein had paid her for a massage. 
Epstein was a multi-millionaire financier with residences in Palm Beach, New York City, and 
other United States and foreign locations. The investigation led to the discovery that Epstein used 
personal assistants to recruit girls to provide massages to him, and in many instances, those 
massages led to sexual activity. After the PBPD brought the case to the State Attorney's Office, a 
Palm Beach County grand jury indicted Epstein, on July 19, 2006, for felony solicitation of 
prostitution in violation of Florida Statute § 796.07. However, because the PBPD Chief and the 
lead Detective were dissatisfied with the State Attorney's handling of the case and believed that 
the state grand jury's charge did not address the totality of Epstein's conduct, they referred the 
matter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in West Palm Beach for a possible federal 
investigation. 
The FBI brought the matter to an Assistant U.S. Attorney (AUSA), who opened a file with 
her supervisor's approval and with the knowledge of then U.S. Attorney R. Alexander Acosta. 
She worked with two FBI case agents to develop a federal case against Epstein and, in the course 
of the investigation, they discovered additional victims. In May 2007, the AUSA submitted to her 
supervisors a draft 60-count indictment outlining charges against Epstein. She also provided a 
lengthy memorandum summarizing the evidence she had assembled in support of the charges and 
addressing the legal issues related to the proposed charges. 
For several weeks following submission of the prosecution memorandum and proposed 
indictment, the AUSA's supervisors reviewed the case to determine how to proceed. At a July 31, 
2007 meeting with Epstein's attorneys, the USAO offered to end its investigation if Epstein pled 
guilty to state charges, agreed to serve a minimum of two years' incarceration, registered as a 
sexual offender, and agreed to a mechanism through which victims could obtain monetary 
damages. The USAO subsequently engaged in additional meetings and communications with 
Epstein's team of attorneys, ultimately negotiating the terms of a state-based resolution of the 
federal investigation, which culminated in the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2007. The 
As used in this Report, including in quoted documents and statements, the word "girls" refers to females who 
were under the age of 18 at the time of the alleged conduct. Under Florida law, a minor is a person under the age 
of 18. 
EFTA00013360
--- PAGE 3 ---
NPA required Epstein to plead guilty in state court to the then-pending state indictment against 
him and to an additional criminal information charging him with a state offense that would require 
him to register as a sexual offender—specifically, procurement of minors to engage in prostitution, 
in violation of Florida Statute § 796.03. 
The NPA required Epstein to make a binding 
recommendation that the state court sentence him to serve 18 months in the county jail followed 
by 12 months of community control (home detention or "house arrest"). The NPA also included 
provisions designed to facilitate the victims' recovery of monetary damages from Epstein. In 
exchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in 
the Southern District of Florida of him, four named co-conspirators, and "any potential 
co-conspirators." Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state resolution or 
the NPA prior to its signing. 
The signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to Epstein's guilty plea and incarceration, 
however. For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his extensive team of prominent attorneys 
to try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously 
seeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no 
federal interest at issue and the matter should be left to the discretion of state law enforcement 
officials. Through repeated communications with the USAO and senior Department officials, 
defense counsel fought the government's interpretation of the NPA's terms. They also sought and 
obtained review by the Department's Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Attorney 
General, primarily on the issue of federal jurisdiction over what the defense insisted was "a 
quintessentially state matter." After reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO, on 
June 23, 2008, the Office of the Deputy Attorney General informed defense counsel that the 
Deputy Attorney General would not intervene in the matter. Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill 
his obligation under the NPA, and on June 30, 2008, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to 
the pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA, 
to a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution. 
Upon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the 
court immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of 12 months' incarceration on the 
solicitation charge and 6 months' incarceration on the procurement charge, followed by 12 months 
of community control. Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm 
Beach County facility. A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court. 
On July 7, 2008, a victim, identified as "Jane Doe," filed in federal court in the Southern 
District of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated the Crime Victims' 
Rights Act (CVRA), 18 U.S.C. § 3771, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein 
without consulting with victims, and seeking enforcement of her CVRA rights.2 In responding to 
the petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did 
not produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a protective 
order; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court. After the initial filings and 
hearings, the CVRA case was dormant for almost two years while the petitioners pursued civil 
cases against Epstein. 
Emergency Victim's Petition for Enforcement of Crime Victim's [sic] Rights Act, 18 U.S.C. Section 3771, 
Doe v. United States, Case No. 9:08-cv-80736-1CAM (S.D. Fla. July 7, 2008). Another victim subsequently joined 
the litigation as "Jane Doe 2." 
EFTA00013361
--- PAGE 4 ---
Soon after he was incarcerated, Epstein applied for the Palm Beach County Sheriff's work 
release program, and the Sheriff approved his application. In October 2008, Epstein began 
spending 12 hours a day purportedly working at the "Florida Science Foundation," an entity 
Epstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of 
Epstein's attorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of 18 months, Epstein 
received "gain time," that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than 13 months 
of incarceration. On July 22, 2009, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home 
detention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the 
Florida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts 
for release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge 
in September 2009 ordered it to be made public. 
By mid-2010, Epstein reportedly settled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by 
victims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During 
the CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial 
document productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and 
submitted declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal 
investigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was 
permitted to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court 
ultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO's resolution of the Epstein case 
be made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting 
the CVRA. After failed efforts to settle the case, the parties' cross motions for summary judgment 
remained pending for more than a year. 
In 2017, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his 
March 2017 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On 
April 17, 2017, the Senate confirmed Acosta's appointment as Labor Secretary. 
In the decade following his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to 
settle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able 
to resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2018, 
however, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal 
criminal investigations initiated more than 12 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced 
girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.; The Miami Herald 
reported that in 2007, Acosta entered into an "extraordinary" deal with Epstein in the form of the 
NPA, which permitted Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison 
sentence by pleading guilty in state court to "two prostitution charges." According to the Miami 
Herald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein's co-conspirators and 
concealed from Epstein's victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included 
interviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper 
painted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a 
wealthy man with powerful and politically connected friends by granting him a "deal of a lifetime" 
that allowed him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his

abuse of minors. The Miami Herald report led to public outrage and media scrutiny of the 
government's actions.' 
On February 21, 2019, the district court granted the CVRA case petitioners' Motion for 
Partial Summary Judgment, ruling that the government violated the CVRA in failing to advise the 
victims about its intention to enter into the NPA.5 The court also found that letters the government 
sent to victims after the NPA was signed, describing the investigation as ongoing, "mislead [sic] 
the victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility." The court also highlighted 
the inequity of the USAO's failure to communicate with the victims while at the same time 
engaging in "lengthy negotiations" with Epstein's counsel and assuring the defense that the NPA 
would not be "made public or filed with the court." The court ordered the parties to submit 
additional briefs regarding the appropriate remedies. After the court's order, the Department 
recused the USAO from the CVRA litigation and assigned the U.S. Attorney's Office for the 
Northern District of Georgia to handle the case for the government. Among the remedies sought 
by the petitioners, and opposed by the government, was rescission of the NPA and federal 
prosecution of Epstein. 
On July 2, 2019, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York obtained 
a federal grand jury indictment charging Epstein with one count of sex trafficking of minors and 
one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors. The indictment alleged that from 
2002 until 2005, Epstein created a vast network of underage victims in both New York and Florida 
whom he sexually abused and exploited. Epstein was arrested on the charges on July 6, 2019. In 
arguing for Epstein's pretrial detention, prosecutors asserted that agents searching Epstein's 
Manhattan residence found thousands of photos of nude and half-nude females, including at least 
one believed to be a minor. The court ordered Epstein detained pending trial, and he was remanded 
to the custody of the Bureau of Prisons and held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in 
Manhattan. 
Meanwhile, after publication of the November 2018 Miami Herald report, the media and 
Congress increasingly focused attention on Acosta as the government official responsible for the 
NPA. On July 10, 2019, Acosta held a televised press conference to defend his and the USAO's 
actions. Acosta stated that the Palm Beach State Attorney's Office "was ready to allow Epstein to 
walk free with no jail time, nothing." According to Acosta, because USAO prosecutors considered 
this outcome unacceptable, his office pursued a difficult and challenging case and obtained a 
resolution that put Epstein in jail, forced him to register as a sexual offender, and provided victims 
with the means to obtain monetary damages. 
Acosta's press conference did not end the 
controversy, however, and on July 12, 2019, Acosta submitted to the President his resignation as

Secretary of Labor. In a brief oral statement, Acosta explained that continued media attention on 
his handling of the Epstein investigation rather than on the economy was unfair to the Labor 
Department. 
On August 10, 2019, Epstein was found hanging in his cell and was later pronounced dead. 
The New York City Chief Medical Examiner concluded that Epstein had committed suicide. 
As a result of Epstein's death, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of 
New York filed a nolle prosequi to dismiss the pending indictment against Epstein. On 
August 27, 2019, the district court held a hearing at which more than a dozen of Epstein's 
victims—including victims of the conduct in Florida that was addressed through the NPA—spoke 
about the impact of Epstein's crimes. 
The court dismissed the Epstein indictment on 
August 29, 2019. 
After Epstein's death, the federal district court in Florida overseeing the CVRA litigation 
denied the petitioners their requested remedies and closed the case as moot. Among its findings, 
the court concluded that although the government had violated the CVRA, the government had 
asserted "legitimate and legally supportable positions throughout this litigation," and therefore had 
not litigated in bad faith. The court also noted it expected the government to "honor its 
representation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the proper 
treatment of crime victims," as well as honoring its promise to meet with the victims. 
On September 30, 2019, CVRA petitioner "Jane Doe 1" filed in her true name a petition 
for a writ of mandamus in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, seeking 
review of the district court's order denying all of her requested remedies. In its responsive brief, 
the government argued that "as a matter of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not attach 
prior to the government charging a case" and thus, "the CVRA was not triggered in [the Southern 
District of Florida] because no criminal charges were brought." Nevertheless, during oral 
argument, the government conceded that the USAO had not been "fully transparent" with the 
petitioner and had "made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was ongoing when in 
fact the NPA had been signed." On April 14, 2020, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals denied 
the petition, ruling that CVRA rights do not attach until a defendant has been criminally charged. 
On August 7, 2020, the court granted the petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel's 
opinion; as of the date of this Report, a briefing schedule has been issued, and oral argument is set 
for December 3, 2020. 
II. 
THE INITIATION AND SCOPE OF OPR'S INVESTIGATION 
After the Miami Herald published its investigative report on November 28, 2018, 
U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Oversight, Agency 
Action, Federal Rights and Federal Courts, sent a December 3, 2018 letter to OPR, citing the Miami 
Herald's report and requesting that OPR "open an investigation into the instances identified in this 
reporting of possible misconduct by Department of Justice attorneys." On February 6, 2019, the 
Department of Justice Office of Legislative Affairs advised Senator Sasse that OPR had opened 
EFTA00013364
--- PAGE 7 ---
an investigation into the matter and would review the USAO's decision to resolve the federal 
investigation of Epstein through the NPA.6
After the district court issued its ruling in the CVRA litigation, on February 21, 2019, OPR 
included within the scope of its investigation an examination of the government's conduct that 
formed the basis for the court's findings that the USAO violated the CVRA in failing to afford 
victims a reasonable right to confer with the government about the NPA before the agreement was 
signed and that the government affirmatively misled victims about the status of the federal 
investigation. 
During the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands 
of records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department components, including the Office of 
the Deputy Attorney General, the Criminal Division, and the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys. 
The records included emails, letters, memoranda, and investigative materials. OPR also collected 
and reviewed materials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein. OPR also 
examined extensive publicly available information, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and 
other court records, and reviewed media reports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books 
relating to the Epstein case. 
In addition to this extensive documentary review, OPR conducted more than 60 interviews 
of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI administrative personnel; 
current and former USAO staff and attorneys; current and former Department attorneys and senior 
managers, including a former Deputy Attorney General and a former Assistant Attorney General 
for the Criminal Division; and the former State Attorney and former Assistant State Attorney in 
charge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed several victims and attorneys 
representing victims, and reviewed written submissions from victims, concerning victim contacts 
with the USAO and the FBI. 
OPR identified former U.S. Attorney Acosta, three former USAO supervisors, and the 
AUSA as subjects of its investigation based on preliminary information indicating that each of 
them was involved in the decision to resolve the case through the NPA or in the negotiations 
leading to the agreement. OPR deems a current or former Department attorney to be a subject of 
its investigation when the individual's conduct is within the scope of OPR's review and may result 
in a finding of professional misconduct. OPR reviewed prior public statements made by Acosta 
and another subject. All five subjects cooperated fully with OPR's investigation. OPR requested 
that all of the subjects provide written responses detailing their involvement in the federal 
investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and decisions relating to victim 
notification and consultation. OPR received and reviewed written responses from all of the 
subjects, and subsequently conducted extensive interviews of each subject under oath and before 
a court reporter. 
Each subject was represented by counsel and had access to relevant 
contemporaneous documents before the subject's OPR interview. The subjects reviewed and 
provided comments on their respective interview transcripts and on OPR's draft report. OPR 
The federal government was closed from December 22, 2018, to January 25, 2019. After initiating its 
investigation, OPR also subsequently received other letters from U.S. Senators and Representatives inquiring into the 
status of the OPR investigation. 
vi

--- PAGE 8 ---
carefully considered the comments and made changes, or noted comments, as OPR deemed 
appropriate; OPR did not, however, alter its findings and conclusions. 
Finally, OPR reviewed relevant case law, statutes, regulations, Department policy, and 
attorney professional responsibility rules as necessary to resolve the issues presented in this case 
and to determine whether the subjects committed professional misconduct. 
As part of its investigation, OPR examined the interactions between state officials and the 
federal investigators and prosecutors, but because OPR does not have jurisdiction over state 
officials, OPR did not investigate, or reach conclusions about, their conduct regarding the state 
investigation.' Because OPR's mission is to ensure that Department attorneys adhere to the 
standards of professional conduct, OPR's investigation focused on the actions of the subject 
attorneys rather than on determining the full scope of Epstein's and his assistants' criminal 
behavior. Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein's and his 
assistants' conduct as it was known to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as 
Department attorneys. Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 30, 2008, 
when Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects' actions prior to 
that date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects' conduct on the basis of that subsequent 
information. 
OPR's investigation occurred approximately 12 years after most of the significant events 
relating to the USAO's investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein's guilty plea. As a result, 
many of the subjects and witnesses were unable to recall the details of events or their own or 
others' actions occurring in 2006-2008, such as conversations, meetings, or documents they 
reviewed at the times However, OPR's evaluation of the subjects' conduct was aided significantly 
by extensive, contemporaneous emails among the prosecutors and communications between the 
government and defense counsel. These records often referred to the interactions among the 
participants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them. 
III. 
OVERVIEW OF OPR'S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK 
OPR's primary mission is to ensure that Department attorneys perform their duties in 
accordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation's principal 
law enforcement agency. Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct 
against current or former Department attorneys related to the exercise of their authority to 
In August 2019, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of 
Law Enforcement to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein. As reported, the 
investigation focuses on Epstein's state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program. 
OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution 
of, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2019. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in 
the Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that 
litigation in early 2019, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions 
to review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR's request for a written 
response, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these 
materials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in 
preparation for their interviews. 
vii 
EFTA00013366
--- PAGE 9 ---
investigate, litigate, or provide legal advice.9 OPR also has jurisdiction to investigate allegations 
of misconduct against Department law enforcement agents when they relate to a Department 
attorney's alleged professional misconduct. 
In its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs 
the challenged conduct and whether a subject attorney violated that standard. Department 
attorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of 
their duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by attorney 
licensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it 
concludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject attorney violated such a standard 
intentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR's analytical framework, when OPR concludes that 
(1) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not 
intentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the 
subject's conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude 
that a subject attorney's conduct does not satisfy the elements necessary for a professional 
misconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may 
conclude that a subject attorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted 
inappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subject attorney's 
conduct was appropriate under the circumstances.10
IV. 
ISSUES CONSIDERED 
In this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to 
the negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO's 
interactions with Epstein's victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets 
of issues are described below and are analyzed separately in this Report. 
A. 
The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA 
In evaluating whether any of the subjects committed professional misconduct, OPR 
considered whether any of the NPA's provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute, 
professional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR 
considered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (1) charging decisions, (2) declination 
of criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants 
C.F.R. § 0.39a(aX I). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of attorneys occurring 
during their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the attorney left the Department before or during 
OPR's investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department 
attorneys. Although former Department attorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR's determination that 
a former Department attorney violated state rules of professional conduct for attorneys could result in a referral to an 
appropriate state attorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct 
of Department attorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases. 
In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after 
a preliminary inquiry into the matter. In December 2010, one of the attorneys representing victims in the CVRA 
litigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation 
and that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstein's crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its 
standard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation into those allegations at that time in deference to the 
then-pending CVRA litigation. 
viii 
EFTA00013367
--- PAGE 10 ---
of immunity, or (6) the deportation of criminal aliens. The potentially applicable standards that 
OPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report. OPR 
also examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter 
into the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive, 
such as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and 
discusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed 
that shed additional light on the USAO's handling of the Epstein investigation. 
B. 
The District Court's Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA 
To address the district court's adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content, 
and timing of the government's interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was 
signed, including victim notification letters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews 
conducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject attorneys violated any clear 
and unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the 
government's lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the 
circumstances relating to the district court's finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein's 
victims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed. 
V. 
OPR'S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS 
OPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in 
various decisions and events. Acosta, however, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal 
investigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of 
the initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led 
to the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved 
it, with knowledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknowledged that he approved 
the NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for 
the NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta's overall 
responsibility for the government's interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less 
clear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR 
evaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions. 
A. 
Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA 
With respect to all five subjects of OPR's investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects 
did not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and 
approval of the NPA. Under OPR's framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a 
subject attorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing 
the conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict 
Epstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. 
Furthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable 
standards. 
As the U.S. Attorney, Acosta had the "plenary authority" under established federal law and 
Department policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his 
decision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta's decision to decline to 
initiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not 
ix 
EFTA00013368
--- PAGE 11 ---
find evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations, 
such as Epstein's wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shows that Acosta resisted defense 
efforts to have the matter returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed 
appropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration 
requirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta's "breakfast meeting" with one 
of Epstein's defense counsel in October 2007 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier, 
or to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records show 
that USAO managers' concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on 
the victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta's concerns about the proper 
role of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a 
state-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional 
misconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other 
subjects committed professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta's decisions. 
Nevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta's decision to resolve the federal investigation 
through the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of 
Acosta's broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA 
was a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its 
investigation of Epstein. In Acosta's view, the federal government's role in prosecuting Epstein 
was limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should 
be recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a "backstop" to state 
authorities by encouraging them to do more. However, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties 
inherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had 
no authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were 
completed; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the 
consideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta's application of federalism 
principles was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too 
narrow, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use 
the NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the 
NPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other 
jobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination 
and communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a 
unique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided. 
B. 
Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government's Interactions with 
Victims 
OPR further concludes that none of the subject attorneys committed professional 
misconduct with respect to the government's interactions with victims. The subjects did not have 
a clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the 
NPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal 
charge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA 
rights to attach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not 
established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were 
brought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose 
of silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government 
interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government's 
EFTA00013369
--- PAGE 12 ---
treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is contradictory to the 
Department's mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of a crime endure. 
OPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to 
certain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as "under investigation" and that 
failed to inform them of the NPA. The letters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who 
was not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the 
FBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects. 
Moreover, the statement that the matter was "under investigation" was not false because the 
government in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill 
the terms of the NPA. However, the letters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim 
frustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the 
investigation. The letters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies 
responsible for communicating with Epstein's victims and showed a lack of attention to and 
oversight regarding communication with victims. 
After the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Attorney the decision 
whether to notify victims about the state's plea hearing pursuant to the state's own victim's rights 
requirements. Although Acosta's decision was within his authority and did not constitute 
professional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to 
make certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal 
investigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important 
proceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had 
communicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the 
Department intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were 
made aware of a court proceeding that was related to their own cases, and thus he failed to ensure 
that victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity. 
OPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA 
after it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and 
conversations with victims' attorneys in 2008 do not constitute professional misconduct. 
Contemporaneous records show that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating 
impeachment evidence that Epstein's victims had financial motives to make claims against him, 
evidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing 
victims. Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and 
discussions with victims' attorneys occurring in 2008 led to interactions that contributed to 
victims' feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them. 
After examining the full scope and context of the government's interactions with victims, 
OPR concludes that the government's lack of transparency and its inconsistent messages led to 
victims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the 
misimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein's counsel to keep the NPA secret 
from the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement. The 
overall result of the subjects' anomalous handling of this case understandably left many victims 
feeling ignored and frustrated and resulted in extensive public criticism. In sum, OPR concludes 
that the victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by the 
Department.

VI. 
ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT 
The Report is divided into three chapters. In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant 
federal, state, and local law enforcement entities involved in investigating Epstein's criminal 
conduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question. 
OPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense attorneys who interacted with 
the subjects. 
In Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an extensive account of events relating to the federal 
investigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2005 by a young 
victim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law 
enforcement authorities—and continues through the mid-2006 opening of the federal 
investigation; the September 2007 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein's subsequent 
efforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein's June 2008 
guilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein's compliance with 
the terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July 
2010. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations 
relating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA. OPR 
describes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects' 
conduct. 
Chapter Three concerns the government's interactions with victims and the district court's 
findings regarding the CVRA. OPR describes the relevant events and analyzes the subjects' 
conduct in light of the pertinent standards. 
OPR sets forth the extensive factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including 
internal USAO and Department communications, because doing so is necessary for a full 
understanding of the subjects' actions and of the bases for OPR's conclusions.

Chicago, IL, for Lawrence Thomas. 
MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER 
ALESIA, District Judge. 
Before the court are pretrial motions in limine as well as a 
few remaining pretrial motions and matters. For 
background on this case see United States v. Messino, 871 
F.Supp. 1035 (N.D.I11.1995), and other cases cited at 871 
F.Supp. at 1037-38 of that opinion. 
I. TAINT ISSUES RELATED TO PREVIOUSLY 
SUPPRESSED EVIDENCE 
On January 18, 1995, the court conducted a taint hearing 
to determine what, if any, items would be suppressed as 
evidence because of their having been derived from leads 
attributable to already suppressed evidence. The hearings 
were on the motions of defendants Christopher Richard 
Messino and Clement A. Messino. Based upon the 
credible evidence of record the court makes the following 
findings of fact and conclusions of law. The court 
considers now only those items challenged in defendants' 
post-hearing submissions. 
*1181 A. Findings of Fact 
Credibility Finding 
1. Special Agent Michael Priess, the sole witness at the 
hearing, was a credible witness in all respects. His 
testimony 
demonstrated 
detailed 
recall 
of 
facts 
surrounding the instant investigation. 
Challenges from Christopher Richard Messina 
2. The lease between Nick Sula and Christopher Richard 
Messino is attributable to an independent source of 
discovery. 
3. The government's identification and use of Jerry Haas 
and Lisa Batts as witnesses are attributable to an 
independent source of discovery. 
Challenges from Clement A. Messino 
4. The government's identification of Clement A. 
Messino's boat and place of purchase are attributable to 
an independent source of discovery. 
5. The government's identification and use of George 
Thorpe, John Richard, Phillip Webb, Ed Cozzi, and Frank 
Fuscone as witnesses are attributable to an independent 
source of discovery. 
6. The identity and significance of Chris Smith as a 
witness would have inevitably been discovered even 
absent utilization of tainted leads. 
6. Bank records from Interstate Bank of Oak Forest, 
Chesterfield Bank, Beverly Bank, Thomridge State Bank, 
Evergreen Plaza Bank, Heritage Bank of Crestwood, First 
National Bank of Harvey, and First National Bank of Blue 
Island, as well as any credit card records would, at the 
very least, have been inevitably discovered even absent 
utilization of tainted leads. 
B. Conclusions of Law 
I. The exclusionary rule prohibits "the introduction of 
evidence obtained as the direct or indirect result of an 
illegal search." United States v. Markling, 7 F.3d 1309, 
1315 (7th Cir.1993) (citing Murray v. United States, 487 
U.S. 533, 536, 108 S.Ct. 2529, 2532, 101 L.Ed.2d 472 
(1988)). 
2. Various doctrines define whether evidence not 
primarily tainted was obtained as a result of the primary 
illegality. See generally 4 WAYNE R. LAFAVE, 
SEARCH & SEIZURE § 11.4(a) (2d ed. 1987). 
121 3. When the disputed evidence is attributable to a 
source independent of the illegally obtained primary item, 
the independent source doctrine renders the evidence 
admissible despite the primary taint. Markling, 7 F.3d at

--- PAGE 8 ---
U.S. v. Messino, 873 F.Supp. 1177 (1995) 
1314-18, 1318 n. I. 
PI 4. When the disputed evidence inevitably would have 
been discovered by lawful means, the inevitably 
discovery doctrine renders the evidence admissible 
despite the primary taint. See United States v. Jackson, 
901 F.2d 83, 84-85 (7th Cir.I 990); Markling, 7 F.3d at 
1318 n. 1. 
C. Holding 
141 151 No further items are suppressed as evidence because 
of tainted leads. 
II. GOVERNMENT'S CONSOLIDATED 
PRE—TRIAL MOTION IN LIMINE 
The 
government's 
motion 
raises 
eight 
separate 
evidentiary issues. 
A. Impeachment of Joseph Granata 
For reasons discussed under Clement Messino's motion in 
!amine, the government's motion in this regard is granted. 
B. Evidence and Argument of Lawfulness and 
Non-corrupt Conduct 
161 The government's motion in this respect cannot be 
evaluated absent the more specific context provided at 
trial. Accordingly, in this respect said motion is denied. 
C. Evidence and Argument of Outrageous 
Government Conduct 
The government's motion in this respect cannot be 
evaluated absent the more specific context provided at 
trial. Accordingly, in this respect said motion is denied. 
*1182 D. Evidence and Argument of Entrapment 
I'll No defendant has responded to this part of the motion 
by asserting a right to argue entrapment in opening 
statements. Accordingly, in this regard the government's 
motion is denied as moot.' 
E. Mention of Prior Prosecution Experience by 
Defense Counsel 
181 Clement Messino's attorney, as far as the court is 
aware, is the only person to whom this argument is 
directed. Counsel represents he has no intention to 
mention his prosecution experience. On the off chance 
another attorney or a witness might introduce the fact of 
counsel's prosecution experience, the court holds that the 
subject is irrelevant, and accordingly grants the motion in 
this regard. FED.R.EVID. 401, 402. 
F. Evidence and Argument About Draft Transcripts 
191 The government does not appear to dispute that a draft 
transcript prepared by a witness may be used to impeach 
that witness. Rather the government objects to using the 
draft against another witness, which would not be proper 
impeachment. 
Accordingly, 
in 
this 
regard 
the 
government's motion is granted.' 
G. Allegations of Witness Wrongdoing Not Involving 
Dishonesty 
1101 The government here seeks to regulate impeachment 
of its witnesses at trial. Without context, the court must 
reserve ruling, and accordingly in this respect the 
government's motion is denied. 
H. Maximum Penalties Faced by Witnesses 
1111 The government wants to exclude introduction of the 
statutory maximum penalty, arguing that such a number is 
misleading given the realities of sentencing under the 
United States Sentencing Guidelines. Such evidence is 
Rule 401 relevant to the issue of credibility. To the extent 
the statutory maximum does not tell the whole story, the 
government is free to explore that on re-direct

examination. 
Accordingly, 
in 
this 
regard 
the 
government's motion is denied. 
In conclusion, the Government's Motion in Limine is 
granted in part, denied in part, and denied as moot in part. 
III. GOVERNMENT'S MOTION FOR LEAVE TO 
RECALL CERTAIN WITNESSES DURING ITS 
CASE IN CHIEF 
1121 " 31 In order to present its case in a "chronological, 
coherent manner," the government asks to be able to 
recall certain witnesses during its case in chief. The court 
has the discretionary authority to allow the case in chief to 
proceed as the government suggests. See United States v. 
Dent, 984 F.2d 1453, 1463 (7th Cir.) (citing cases), cert. 
denied, 510 U.S. 858, 114 S.Ct. 169, 126 L.Ed.2d 129, 
and 510 U.S. 875, 114 S.Ct. 209, 126 L.Ed.2d 165 (1993); 
FED.R.EVID. 611(a). The court agrees with the 
government that, properly executed, its proposal would be 
beneficial to the jury's following the government's case. 
Accordingly, the Government's Motion for Leave to 
Recall Certain Witnesses During Its Case in Chief is 
granted. 
IV. DEFENDANT CHRISTOPHER RICHARD 
MESSINO'S MOTION IN LIMINE TO PRECLUDE 
INCOMPETENT LAW OPINION EVIDENCE, 
EVIDENCE BASED UPON LACK OF PERSONAL 
KNOWLEDGE AND EVIDENCE BASED UPON 
HEARSAY 
Defendant Christopher Richard Messino's motion, 
phrased as it is, seeks merely to enforce Rules 602, 701 
and 802. As long as the court is careful to note that 
defendant's examples of enforcement of these rules are 
not necessarily valid, the motion may be granted. 
*1183 Defendant Christopher Richard Messino's Motion 
in Limine to Preclude Incompetent Law Opinion 
Evidence, Evidence Based upon Lack of Personal 
Knowledge and Evidence Based upon Hearsay is granted. 
FED.R.EVID. 602, 701 and 802. 
V. DEFENDANT CHRISTOPHER RICHARD 
MESSINO'S MOTION IN LIMINE TO PRECLUDE 
EVIDENCE REGARDING CHRISTOPHER 
RICHARD MESSINO'S EMPLOYMENT AS A 
POLICE OFFICER 
Defendant Christopher Richard Messino's Motion in 
Limine to Preclude Evidence Regarding Christopher 
Richard Messino's Employment as a Police officer is 
denied. FED.R.EVID. 401, 402, 403. 
VI. DEFENDANT CHRISTOPHER RICHARD 
MESSINO'S OMNIBUS MOTION IN LIMINE 
Defendant Christopher Richard Messino seeks to preclude 
introduction of sixteen categories of evidence. 
A. Certain Et ents Pe 
g to Clement Messino 
I. Escape 
The government does not intend to introduce such 
evidence, and so the motion in this regard is denied as 
moot. 
2. Granata Dealings 
The court has previously ruled on the Granata 
transactions, and in this regard the motion is denied. 
3. Gun 
NI Such evidence is admissible on a tool-of-the-trade 
theory. See United States v. Ramirez, Nos. 93-4056 & 
93-4059, 1995 WL 17808, at •7 (7th Cir. Jan. 19, 1995). 
In this regard, the motion is denied.

U.S. v. Messino, 873 F.Supp. 1'177 (1995) 
4. Severance 
The government is right. The severance issue has been 
given its due. In this regard the motion is denied. 
B. Tax Evidence for Years Other than 1986 and 1987 
115) This evidence may be admissible to show no 
legitimate source of income. See United States v. Briscoe, 
896 F.2d 1476, 1500 (7th Cir.) ("It is well settled that in 
narcotics prosecutions, a defendant's possession and 
expenditure of large sums of money, as well as his or her 
failure to file tax returns, are relevant to establish that, in 
all probability, the reason for the failure to report this 
income is due to the defendant's participation in illegal 
activities."), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 863, III S.Ct. 173, 
112 L.Ed.2d 137 (1990). Accordingly, in this regard the 
motion is denied. 
C. Rumors Regarding Murders 
The government has no intention of introducing any 
murder issue, so in this regard the motion is denied as 
moot. 
D. Sex Evidence/Use of Prostitutes 
1161 1171 The motion and the government's response raise a 
few issues here. First, any defendant's use of prostitutes is 
irrelevant and overly prejudicial, absent some special 
circumstances, which the government does not forward. 
Second, defendant wants to avoid reference to the fact 
that some defendants may have had sexual relationships 
with the same women. The government is right, though, 
to note that it may be difficult for a witness to tell her 
story of her relation to those defendants without 
discussing the fact that she dated them. The government 
intends to elicit the information in a "non-inflammatory" 
manner, a representation under which the introduction of 
the evidence will not be unduly prejudicial. 
In this regard the motion is granted in part and denied in 
part. 
*1184 E. Possession of Weapons 
This evidence is admissible on a tool-of-the-trade theory, 
as discussed above. In this regard the motion is denied. 
F. Loan Sharking 
I'M All the government intends to do here is introduce 
evidence of large cash loans to show defendant's 
possession of such cash as evidence of the conspiracy. 
This introduction is admissible. See United States v. 
James, 40 F.3d 850, 861 (7th Cir.1994), cert. denied, No. 
94-7225, 1995 WL 21671 (U.S. Jan. 23, 1995); see also 
Briscoe, 896 F.2d at 1500. In this regard the motion is 
denied. 
G. Car Theft Activity 
On this issue the court has previously reserved ruling. In 
this regard the motion is denied. 
H. Kim Forbes 
Defendant seeks to bar introduction of confidential 
marital communications. The government agrees with this 
theory. In this regard the motion is granted, although fact 
issues related to the privilege may arise at trial. 
I. Yvette Gifford 
1191 Defendant raises three objections to predicted 
testimony by Yvette Gifford regarding aliases, the 
carrying of a briefcase full of $10,000, and putting assets 
in other persons' names. Depending on context, these 
incidents could be Rule 401 relevant. Also, any 
foundational issues are properly addressed at trial. In this 
regard the motion is denied. 
J. Michael Homerding 
Defendant seeks to bar evidence of Homerding being shot 
at, which the government does not seek to introduce. In

EFTA00013382
--- PAGE 11 ---
U.S. v. Messino, 873 F.Supp. 1177 (1995) 
this regard the motion is denied as moot. 
K. Timothy Larkin 
Two concerns are here. First is evidence of an accusation 
by Christopher Richard Messina that Larkin stole money. 
The government does not seek to introduce such 
evidence. Second is evidence of large amounts of cash, 
which the government is entitled to introduce. In this 
regard the motion is denied as moot in part and denied in 
part. 
L. Mary Beth Maroulis 
Here the motion raises foundational issues, reserved for 
trial. In this regard the motion is denied. 
M. Dawn Peco 
Here the motion addresses a gun shot incident, which the 
government says it will not introduce. In this regard the 
motion is denied as moot. 
N. Pete Peco, Jr. 
12.1 Here defendant raises an issue of evidence of a debt 
owed by Gray Chrystall to Christopher Richard Messina. 
The government's theory is that the debt will be linked up 
when viewed in the context of the evidence at trial. 
Accordingly, the court reserves ruling by denying the 
motion in this regard. 
0. Pete Peco, Sr. 
The government has agreed not to introduce the disputed 
evidence that Christopher Richard Messina asked this 
witness to beat up a certain "kid." Accordingly, in this 
regard the motion is denied as moot. 
P. Terry Saberhagen 
PH The government's theory of the admissibility of 
challenged testimony by Saberhagen is based on 
Saberhagen's being an unindicted coconspirator. The 
court reserves ruling until trial, as the papers cannot 
supply enough context presently to rule. In this regard the 
motion is denied. 
In conclusion, Defendant Christopher Richard Messino's 
Omnibus Motion in Limine is granted in part, denied in 
part, and denied as moot in part. 
*1185 VII. DEFENDANT CHRISTOPHER 
RICHARD MESSINO'S MOTION FOR 
ADDITIONAL PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES 
MI Under Rule 24(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal 
Procedure, in this non•capital case in which "the offense 
charged is punishable by more than one year, the 
government is entitled to 6 peremptory challenges and the 
defendant or defendants jointly to 10 peremptory 
challenges." FED.R.CRIM.P. 24(b). However, where, as 
here, "there is more than one defendant, the court may 
allow the defendants additional peremptory challenges 
and permit them to be exercised separately or jointly." Id. 
Both the language of Rule 24(b) and Seventh Circuit 
cases make clear that "[t]he decision whether to grant 
additional peremptory challenges in multi-defendant trials 
... lies within the sound discretion of the district court." 
United States v. Cochran, 955 F.2d 1116, 1121 (7th Cir.) 
(citing United States v. Farmer, 924 F.2d 647, 653 (7th 
Cir.I99 I)), cert. denied, — U.S. 
113 S.Ct. 460, 
121 L.Ed.2d 368 (1992). 
P1 Defendant Christopher Richard Messino argues that 
because potential jurors in this case face a lengthy trial, 
additional peremptory challenges are necessary. At the 
time of the motion, eleven defendants were going to trial, 
and defendant argued that each of the eleven defendants 
going to trial should be allotted three peremptory 
challenges. While the court is aware that the length of a 
trial may complicate the jury selection process,' the 
peremptory challenge plan defendant proposes is not one 
the court in its discretion will employ. 
With eight defendants going to trial as the court writes, 
the court collectively will allow the defendants ten 
peremptory challenges.s Each defendant will have sole 
authority over one challenge. The defendants should come 
to agreement on exercising the remaining challenges. 
Accordingly, Defendant Christopher Richard Messino's 
WESTLAW

EFTA00013383
--- PAGE 12 ---
U.S. v. Messino, 873 F.Supp. 1177 (1995) 
Motion for Additional Peremptory Challenges is denied. 
VIII. DEFENDANT CHRISTOPHER RICHARD 
MESSINO'S MOTION FOR PRODUCTION OF 
EXCULPATORY OR IMPEACHING MATERIAL 
Defendant seeks material pursuant to Brady v. Maryland, 
373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), and 
Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 
L.Ed.2d 104 (1972). Specifically, defendant seeks 
information regarding three individuals: Fred Maleki, 
Cindy Delapena and Patrick Tobin. Regarding Tobin, the 
government represents that it has no written statements. 
Regarding Maleki and Delapena, the government asserts 
that (1) it does not intend to call those witnesses; and (2) 
none of the material on them is exculpatory. 
1241 
1251 The court has verified through in camera 
inspection that the government's files on Malcki and 
Delapena do not contain Brady material. Brady bars the 
prosecution from withholding "evidence that is favorable 
to the defendant and material to an issue at trial." United 
States v. Carson, 9 F.3d 576, 582 (7th Cir.1993), cert. 
denied, 513 U.S. 844, 115 S.Ct. 135, 130 L.Ed.2d 77 
(1994). The Delapena Grand Jury testimony does not 
meet this test. Stretching materiality to its limits, one 
could argue that on some theory Delapena's absence of 
knowledge of any illegality on the part of Christopher 
Richard Messino makes her testimony material. But a 
Brady materiality determination is not a search for mere 
possibilities. Id., 9 F.3d at 583. Under this analysis the 
court will not order production of the Delapena testimony. 
Similarly, Maleki's testimony need not be produced by 
the government. The court's inspection of the testimony 
reveals no Brady material. 
*1186 Accordingly, Defendant Christopher Richard 
Messina's Motion to Produce Exculpatory or Impeaching 
Information is denied. 
IX. DEFENDANT CLEMENT A. MESSINO'S 
MOHON IN LIMINE TO PRECLUDE CERTAIN 
EVIDENCE 
Defendant Clement Messina raises five issues. 
A. Granata Transactions 
1261 The government apparently has defendant Clement 
Messino on tape with Joseph Granata, who was 
transmitting 
the 
conversation 
on behalf of the 
government. The government wants to play the tapes 
without putting Granata himself on the witness stand. 
Clement Messino's motion in this regard seeks to prevent 
the government from playing the tapes unless Granata 
testifies. 
The court finds the Seventh Circuit's decision in United 
States v. McClain, 934 F.2d 822 (7th Cir.1991), 
instructive. In McClain, the Seventh Circuit approved 
admission of tapes even where the government did not put 
the non-defendant participant in the conversation on the 
stand. Id. at 832. The district court also in that case 
properly denied the opportunity of the defendant to 
impeach the non-defendant should the defendant call him. 
Id. The foundational and Sixth Amendment issues here 
are no different than in McClain.' 
This is not a ruling on foundation issues or any other 
aspect of any Granata tapes. This is merely a ruling on 
whether 
some 
per 
se 
requirement 
prevents 
the 
government from introducing the Granata tapes without 
Granata. The court finds no such requirement, and so in 
this regard denies defendant's motion. 
In Defendant has, however, noted transcript portions that 
the court agrees are objectionable and will exclude. 
Specifically, defendant objects to September 15 and 16, 
1991, references potentially to intimidating or even 
murdering a government witness. Both instances have two 
problematic aspects. First, it is not entirely clear that 
Clement Messino in either instance is agreeing to or 
encouraging such intimidation. Second, either through 
inaudibility or truncated transmission the transcripts are 
incomplete. When the subject matter is so potentially 
inflammatory, the better course is to exclude those 
portions of the transcripts. In this regard, therefore, 
defendant's motion is granted. 
B. Pamela Messino 
There is no question that Pamela Messino and defendant 
Clement Messino have been legally married since 1968. 
They are apparently married now and were married at all 
times relevant to this case. Defendant's motion raises the 
implications of that fact for the evidence in this case, 
based on the confidential marital communications 
privilege. United States v. Keck, 773 F.2d 759, 767 (7th 
Cir. 1985).

U.S. v. Messino, 873 F.Supp. 1177 (1995) 
1281 1291 The court does not reach issues of the confidential 
marital communications privilege, because there is a 
threshold issue of whether the adverse spousal testimony 
privilege will apply. See Keck, 773 F.2d at 767. By the 
government's own description, this privilege gives a 
person presently married to a criminal defendant the right 
not to testify against his or her spouse. See United States 
v. Fulk, 816 F.2d 1202, 1205 (7th Cir.1987). The 
government has two reasons why the adverse spousal 
testimony privilege will not apply: first, Pamela Messino 
is not asserting the privilege (as only she can assert it); 
and second, the marriage is a sham. 
1101 As far as the first point, Clement Messino's counsel's 
information is that Pamela Messino will assert the 
privilege. (See Defendant Clement Messino's Reply 
Memorandum in Support of Motion in Limine to Exclude 
Certain Evidence at 9 n. 5.) Therefore, questions under 
this privilege may arise. As far as the second point, as the 
strength of the marriage is contested by defendant, the 
government would have to •1187 prove up any exception, 
or at least present uncontested facts on which the 
exception would be based. See generally United States v. 
Clark, 712 F.2d 299 (7th Cir.1983). Such a prove up 
would undoubtedly resolve many of the issues as to the 
confidential marital communications privilege, which 
Clement Messino himself can invoke. Nonetheless, the 
adverse spousal testimony privilege is a threshold matter. 
The court reserves the factual determinations necessary to 
rule on the privileges until trial, and accordingly denies 
defendant's motion in this regard. 
C. Michael Gubbins 
1311 As the briefing came to a close, all defendant wants 
here is to obligate the government, before presenting 
attorney-client communications, to establish out of 
hearing of the jury that an exception to the privilege 
operates. This is a safe and reasonable request, so the 
motion in this regard is granted.' 
D. "Post-conspiracy" Evidence 
Defendant here challenges transcript portions from five 
dates: January 7, 1992; January 28, 1992; March 3, 1992; 
March 15, 1993; and April 7, 1993. 
1. January 7 and 28, 1992 
The court agrees that the January 7 and 28, 1992, 
statements are, as a preliminary matter, admissible under 
Rule 801(dX2)(E). 
2. April 7, 1993 
The government concedes that the April 7, 1993, 
conversation should be redacted as in Exhibit E-5 to 
defendant's motion. 
3. March 3 and IS, 1993 
As to the March 3 and IS, 1992, conversations, the 
government's position is that while those conversations 
admittedly took place after the end of the charged 
conspiracy (and therefore Rule 801(dX2)(E) does not 
apply), the proposed redactions are too broad. 
1~~1 Since this is not an 801(dX2)(E) admission, issues 
arise under Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 88 
S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968). "[A] defendant is 
deprived of his rights under the Confrontation Clause 
when his nontestifying codefendant's confession naming 
him as a participant in the crime is introduced at their 
joint trial, even if the jury is instructed to consider that 
confession only against the codefendant." Richardson v. 
Marsh, 481 U.S. 200, 201-02, 107 S.Ct. 1702, 1704, 95 
L.Ed.2d 176 (1987). The Richardson court makes clear 
that the references to Clement Messino that he notes do 
not present a Bruton problem because those references 
require "linkage" to Clement Messino before they 
implicate him. Id. at 208, 107 S.Ct. at 1708. The 
government is right here, and therefore the redactions 
should be as the government proposes. Accordingly, in 
this regard defendant's motion is granted in part and 
denied in part.

U.S. v. Messino, 873 F.Supp. 1177 (1995) 
E. Other Issues 
1. Incarceration 
Defendant wishes to avoid introduction of any 
evidence of his incarceration. The government's most 
important response, with which defendant never comes to 
grips, is that paragraph eleven of Count I of the 
Superseding Indictment specifically charges that Clement 
Messino directed coconspirators while incarcerated. 
Introduction of evidence of incarceration is therefore hard 
to avoid. 
In this regard defendant's motion is denied. 
2. Escape 
The government does not intend to introduce specific 
evidence of defendant's escape, so the motion in this 
regard is denied as moot. 
3. Employment as Police Officer 
The motion in this regard is denied. FED.R.EVID. 401, 
402. 
4. Organized Crime References 
The government does not intend to introduce references to 
organized crime, except perhaps for a statement by 
Clement Messina that he is a good gangster because he 
used to be a police officer. The court has been provided a 
paraphrased snippet of testimony from a witness about 
whom it has heard little *1188 or nothing in the context of 
this case. The court must therefore reserve ruling, and the 
motion is accordingly denied. 
In conclusion Defendant Clement Messino's Motion in 
Limine to Exclude Certain Evidence is granted in part, 
denied in part, and denied as moot in part. 
X. DEFENDANT DONALD SOUTHERN'S 
MOTION IN LIMINE TO PRECLUDE VARIOUS 
INADMISSIBLE STATEMENTS 
Defendant Donald Southern raises two evidentiary issues 
regarding (1) statements of presumption, guesses or 
conclusions by lay witnesses, and (2) testimony of 
Southern's role without personal knowledge, unless 
foundation is laid or Rule 80 1(dX2)(E) applies. This is in 
the category of motions to have the Federal Rules of 
Evidence apply to the trial. 
Accordingly, Defendant Donald Southern's Motion in 
Limine to Preclude Various Inadmissible Statements is 
granted. 
XI. DEFENDANT CHRISTOPHER B. MESSINO'S 
MOTION IN LIMINE WITH REGARD TO 
CERTAIN EVIDENCE 
Christopher B. Messino raises two evidentiary issues. 
A. Evidence of Violence of Christopher B. Messino 
The government rightly points out that the court has 
reserved ruling here. Accordingly, in this respect the 
motion is denied. 
B. Evidence Regarding Isolated Incidents of Small 
Controlled Substance Deliveries 
lit The government will attempt to prove that defendant 
sold small amounts of cocaine during the course of and in 
furtherance of the conspiracy. Furthermore, defendant's 
motion is too vague to warrant a ruling that all incidents 
fitting into defendant's description should be excluded. 
Accordingly, in this respect the motion is denied. 
Defendant Christopher B. Messino's Motion in Limine 
with Regard to Certain Evidence is denied.

XII. DEFENDANT BLAISE MESSINO'S MOTION 
IN LIMINE REGARDING THE INTRODUCHON 
OF CERTAIN EVIDENCE 
Defendant Blaise Messino raises two issues. 
A. Possession of Firearms 
At least as a preliminary matter, evidence of possession of 
firearms is admissible on a tool-of-the-trade theory. 
B. Violence 
Issues regarding evidence of violence have been reserved 
for trial. 
Defendant Blaise Messino's Motion in Limine Regarding 
the Introduction of Certain Evidence is denied. 
XIII. DEFENDANT PAUL MESSINO'S MOTION 
IN LIMINE REGARDING INTRODUCHON OF 
CERTAIN EVIDENCE 
Paul Messino's motion in conclusory fashion raises seven 
evidentiary issues. 
A. Evidence of Robberies or a Fight 
The government either does not intend to introduce such 
evidence or correctly notes the motion is not specific 
enough to support a ruling. In this respect the motion is 
denied. 
B. Evidence Regarding His Possession of Weapons 
In this respect defendant's motion is denied. The evidence 
may be admissible on a tool-of-the-trade theory. 
C. Evidence of Violence 
In this respect defendant's motion is denied. the court 
reserving ruling. 
D. Evidence of Drug Deliveries Outside of Charged 
Conspiracy 
Defendant's cursory request here is too vague and 
overbroad to support a ruling. *1189 Accordingly, the 
motion in this respect is denied. 
E. Evidence of Involvement with Stolen Vehicles 
The government correctly notes that the court has 
previously reserved ruling on this issue. In this respect the 
motion is denied. 
F. Evidence that Paul Messino Traveled to Florida to 
Pick Up Cocaine for Clement Messino or Others 
Among other things, this conduct would seem to be part 
of the heart of the case against Paul Messino. The motion 
in this regard is without basis and is denied. 
G. Evidence that Defendant Sold Cocaine to 
Confidential Informant Unless Informant is Produced 
for Cross-examination 
The government argues that there is no such requirement. 
However, any legal issue here is mooted because the 
government intends to produce informants in that 
category. In this regard the motion is denied as moot. 
In conclusion, Defendant Paul Messino's Motion in 
Limine Regarding Introduction of Certain Evidence is 
denied in part and denied as moot in part.

Evidence is denied in part and denied as moot in part. 
All Citations 
873 F.Supp. 1177 
The course of trial may raise other entrapment issues. For now, the court considers only opening statements. 
Any attempt by defendants to use the drafts for other purposes would be evaluated at trial. 
The government wants to preclude evidence that any of its witnesses once worked as prostitutes, but presents no motion. The 
defendants therefore have not properly been afforded an opportunity to present a theory of relevance. 
Length of trial is the only reason defendant offers for his jury selection plan. Ile does not raise the issue of conflicting trial strategy. 
The court nonetheless has taken that danger into consideration and concludes that no conflicting trial strategy problem warrants the 
plan defendant proposes. See Oxtan, 955 F.2d at 1121. 
Of course the government will have six challenges, as prescribed by Rule 24(b). 
In McClain the Seventh Circuit discussed limiting instructions for this situation, 934 F.2d at 832, which the government should 
proffer. 
The court finds no waiver of the privilege on the record it now has.

Synopsis: Deferred prosecution agreements to two BOP MCC NY Officers, Tova Noel and Michael Thomas. 
Description: 
SYNOPSIS: 
The USAO-SDNY plans to offer deferred prosecution agreements to two correctional officers, Tova Noel and 
Michael Thomas, who were employed at the Manhattan Correctional Center ("MCC") and were previously 
charged with making false statements and conspiring to (i) make false statements and (ii) interfere with or 
obstruct the lawful function of the MCC. These charges, which were brought in November 2019, stem from the 
correctional officers' falsification of institutional count and round forms on the night that Jeffrey Epstein 
committed suicide. The deferred prosecution agreements will require, among other things, the defendants to 
cooperate with a pending Office of Inspector General investigation by providing truthful information about the 
events in question; an admission of guilt from both defendants as to the conduct set forth in the indictment; 
and for both defendants to complete 100 hours of community service, preferably in an area related to the 
criminal justice system. The USAO-SDNY plans to file a public letter by Friday, May 21 notifying the Court of the 
defendants' acceptance of the deferred prosecution agreements and seeking a hearing date; the USAO-SDNY 
anticipates that the deferred prosecution agreements will be entered by the Court by the following Friday, May 
28. 
DESCRIPTION: 
On November 14, 2019, USAO-SDNY obtained an indictment against Tova Noel and Michael Thomas which 
charged them with multiple counts of making false statements, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001, and conspiring 
to (i) make false statements and (ii) interfere with or obstruct the lawful function of the MCC, in violation of 18 
U.S.C. § 371. As alleged in the Indictment, on August 9 and 10, 2019, the defendants falsely indicated on 
Bureau of Prison forms that they had completed required institutional counts and rounds. On August 10, 2019, 
inmate Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide while housed in the Special Housing Unit at the MCC. After 
discovering Epstein's body, the defendants admitted to their supervisor that they had failed to conduct at least 
some of the required counts and rounds. The falsification of records occurred prior to their discovery of 
Epstein's body. 
EFTA00013389
--- PAGE 2 ---
The USAO-SDNY plans to offer deferred prosecution agreements to both defendants. The USAO-SDNY has 
determined that deferring the defendants' prosecution is an outcome consistent with the interests of justice, 
the mitigating personal circumstances of the defendants, and the Department's practice in the overwhelming 
majority of other cases in which correctional officers have been investigated or charged with falsifying count or 
round forms. As a condition of the defendants' agreement, they will be required to admit their guilt and 
cooperate by providing truthful information with the Office of Inspector General, which is preparing a report 
on, among other things, their conduct on the night in question, the circumstances in which they discovered 
Epstein's body after his suicide, and the institutional failures that led to Epstein's death at the MCC The 
agreement does not preclude any administrative action or termination by the Bureau of Prisons. The 
defendants will also be subject to pretrial supervision for six months, must refrain from committing any crimes, 
and will be required to complete 100 hours of community service. This outcome is supported by the 
investigative agencies, the Department of Justice, Office of the Inspector General, as well as the Federal Bureau 
of Investigation, and has been approved by Pretrial Services. The USAO-SDNY plans to send a public letter by 
May 21, 2021 to notify the Court that the Government has offered, and the defendants have accepted, deferred 
prosecution agreements, and in order to request a hearing date, which the Government expects to be 
scheduled for the following week, by May 28.

Synopsis: USAO-SDNY's defense of the Bureau of Prisons ("BOP") in ongoing "FOIA" Litigation against NY 
Times 
Description: 
SYNOPSIS: 
In connection with USAO-SDNY's defense of the Bureau of Prisons ("BOP") in ongoing Freedom of 
Information Act ("FOIA") litigation against The New York Times, on Friday, July 2, 2021, the USAO-
SDNY plans to release approximately 2,700 pages of BOP documents related to Jeffrey Epstein's 
incarceration and suicide at the Metropolitan Correctional Center ("MCC"). These records were 
previously withheld due to the ongoing criminal prosecution against Tova Noel and Michael Thomas 
for falsifying records on the night of Epstein's suicide. As noted in UMR #2021-05-66021, USAO-
SDNY entered into deferred prosecution agreements with Noel and Thomas in May 2021 and as such, 
USAO-SDNY no longer plans to assert a FOIA exception related to that criminal prosecution. The 
BOP documents the USAO-SDNY plans to release to The New York Times, which will be immediately 
available for publication by the Times, include: (i) internal BOP memoranda describing the events and 
circumstances of Epstein's incarceration and suicide, including the numerous failures that allowed 
Epstein the opportunity to kill himself; (ii) Epstein's psychological records from MCC; (iii) the autopsy 
report prepared by the New York City Office of the Medical Examiner ("OCME"); and (iv) internal 
emails within BOP and between BOP and USAO-SDNY from the day of Epstein's suicide reflecting 
generally a lack of understanding of what had happened. USAO-SDNY has notified our counterparts 
at the BOP and DOJ-OIG about the pending release. 
DESCRIPTION: 
On August 10, 2019, inmate Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide while housed in the Special Housing 
Unit at the MCC. USAO-SDNY is currently defending the BOP in connection with ongoing FOIA 
litigation filed by The New York Times seeking documents regarding Epstein. Previously, BOP had 
withheld a number of documents based on the pendency of the criminal prosecution of Tova Noel and 
Michael Thomas, the two guards on duty the night of Epstein's suicide who were accused of falsely 
indicating on BOP forms that they had completed required institutional counts and rounds. As noted 
in UMR # 2021-05-66021, in May 2021 USAO-SDNY entered into deferred prosecution agreements 
with Noel and Thomas and as such, USAO-SDNY has notified the presiding Judge in the FOIA 
EFTA00013391
--- PAGE 2 ---
litigation that BOP no longer plans to assert a FOIA exception related to that criminal prosecution. 
Accordingly, pursuant to Court-ordered deadlines in the FOIA litigation, the USAO-SDNY must 
produce the previously-withheld documents, which number approximately 2,700 pages, by July 2, 
2021 to The New York Times, who will then be free to publish those materials. 
The materials primarily consist of internal BOP memoranda, reports, emails, and documents, as well 
as emails with USAO-SDNY, as well as the autopsy report prepared by OCME. As noted above, the 
documents include the following topics and materials: (i) internal BOP memoranda from the day and 
night of Epstein's suicide; (ii) a photograph of a sign that was hung in the Special Housing Unit that 
stated that rounds on Epstein were mandatory, signed "God," which had been defaced to include a 
question mark after "mandatory"; (iii) Epstein's psychological records at MCC, which generally show 
that he claimed not to be suicidal, attempted to manipulate staff, and received some special treatment 
at MCC; (iv) internal BOP memoranda evaluating the circumstances and failures that led to the 
conditions in which Epstein could kill himself, including the failure to reassign a cellmate, to perform 
counts or rounds, to ensure adequate staffing at MCC, and other failures at the institution; (v) emails 
within BOP and between BOP and USAO-SDNY from the day of Epstein's suicide which show efforts 
to find out what was happening at MCC and frustration that MCC was not providing information; (vi) 
emails showing that Main Justice took an interest following Epstein's suicide, and sent individuals to 
tour MCC; and (vii) the OCME autopsy report concluding that Epstein committed suicide by hanging. 
Pursuant to established case law, BOP plans to redact photographs of Epstein's corpse and 
photographs from the autopsy, as well as the names of AUSAs and lower-level BOP staff members. 
As noted above, USAO-SDNY has notified our counterparts at the BOP and DOJ-OIG regarding this 
pending release.

Is it possible for you to please pull the 44 files listed in the attached spreadsheet as original notes and send them to us? 
Right now, the spreadsheet lists the date the files were acquired on, instead of the date of the corresponding interview; 
for us to compare the files against what we already have, we need — at a minimum — the dates the notes were written. If 
you could send us the files themselves, that would be easiest for us. 
Please let me know if USAfx or a physical hard drive would be easiest for this, and I'm happy to coordinate. We'd also like 
this tomorrow or in the next few days, if possible, so that we may continue our review of the 3500 material as 
expeditiously as possible before our upcoming production deadline. 
Happy to jump on a call to explain anything as needed, too. Thank you so much for your help!

GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 
Defendant. 
COUNT ONE 
SUPERSEDING INDICTMENT 
S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
(Conspiracy to Entice Minors to Travel to Engage in 
Illegal Sex Acts) 
The Grand Jury charges: 
OVERVIEW 
1. 
The charges set forth herein stem from the role 
of GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, in the sexual exploitation 
and abuse of multiple minor girls by Jeffrey Epstein. In 
particular, from at least in or about 1994, up to and including 
at least in or about 2004, MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and 
contributed to Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among 
other things, helping Epstein to recruit, groom, and ultimately 
abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age 
of 18. The victims were as young as 14 years old when they were 
groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
that certain victims were in fact under the age of 18. 
2. 
As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to 
abuse minor victims, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, and 
Jeffrey Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to 
EFTA00013398
--- PAGE 2 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 187 Filed 03/29/21 Page 2 of 24 
Epstein's residences in different states, which MAXWELL knew and 
intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to 
sexual abuse. Moreover, in an effort to conceal her crimes, 
MAXWELL repeatedly lied when questioned about her conduct, 
including in relation to some of the minor victims described 
herein, when providing testimony under oath in 2016. 
FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
3. 
During the time periods charged in this 
Indictment, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, had a personal and 
professional relationship with Jeffrey Epstein and was among his 
closest associates. In particular, between in or about 1994 and 
in or about 1997, MAXWELL was in an intimate relationship with 
Epstein. Additionally, between in or about 1994 and in or about 
2004, MAXWELL was paid by Epstein to manage his various 
properties. 
4. 
Beginning in at least 1994, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 
the defendant, enticed and groomed multiple minor girls to 
engage in sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein, through a variety of 
means and methods, including but not limited to the following: 
a. 
MAXWELL first attempted to befriend some of 
Epstein's minor victims prior to their abuse, including by 
asking the victims about their lives, their schools, and their 
families. MAXWELL and Epstein would spend time building 
friendships with minor victims by, for example, taking minor 
EFTA00013399
--- PAGE 3 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 187 Filed 03/29/21 Page 3 of 24 
victims to the movies or shopping. Some of these outings would 
involve MAXWELL and Epstein spending time together with a minor 
victim, while some would involve MAXWELL or Epstein spending 
time alone with a minor victim. 
b. 
Having developed a rapport with a victim, 
MAXWELL would try to normalize sexual abuse for a minor victim 
by, among other things, discussing sexual topics, undressing in 
front of the victim, being present when a minor victim was 
undressed, and/or being present for sex acts involving the minor 
victim and Epstein. 
c. 
MAXWELL'S presence during minor victims' 
interactions with Epstein, including interactions where the 
minor victim was undressed or that involved sex acts with 
Epstein, helped put the victims at ease because an adult woman 
was present. For example, in some instances, MAXWELL would 
massage Epstein in front of a minor victim. In other instances, 
MAXWELL encouraged minor victims to provide massages to Epstein, 
including sexualized massages during which a minor victim would 
be fully or partially nude. Many of those massages resulted in 
Epstein sexually abusing the minor victims. 
d. 
In addition, Epstein offered to help some 
minor victims by paying for travel and/or educational 
opportunities, and MAXWELL encouraged certain victims to accept 
Epstein's assistance. As a result, victims were made to feel 
EFTA00013400
--- PAGE 4 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 187 Filed 03/29/21 Page 4 of 24 
indebted and believed that MAXWELL and Epstein were trying to 
help them. 
e. 
Through this process, MAXWELL and Epstein 
enticed victims to engage in sexual activity with Epstein. In 
some instances, MAXWELL was present for and participated in the 
sexual abuse of minor victims. Some such incidents occurred in 
the context of massages, which developed into sexual encounters. 
5. 
Between approximately in or about 1994 and in or 
about 2004, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, facilitated 
Jeffrey Epstein's access to minor victims by, among other 
things, inducing and enticing, and aiding and abetting the 
inducement and enticement of, multiple minor victims. Victims 
were groomed and/or abused at multiple locations, including the 
following: 
a. 
A multi-story private residence on the Upper 
East Side of Manhattan, New York owned by Epstein (the "New York 
Residence"). 
b. 
An estate in Palm Beach, Florida owned by 
Epstein (the "Palm Beach Residence"). 
c. 
A ranch in Santa Fe, New Mexico owned by 
Epstein (the "New Mexico Residence"). 
d. 
MAXWELL's personal residence in London, 
England. 
EFTA00013401

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 187 Filed 03/29/21 Page 5 of 24 
6. 
Additionally, beginning at least in or about 
2001, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, and Jeffrey Epstein 
enticed and recruited, and caused to be enticed and recruited, 
minor girls to visit Epstein's Palm Beach Residence to engage in 
sex acts with Epstein, after which Epstein, MAXWELL, or another 
employee of Epstein's would give the victims hundreds of dollars 
in cash. Epstein and MAXWELL encouraged one or more of those 
victims to travel with Epstein with the intention that the 
victim engage in sex acts with Epstein. Moreover, and in order 
to maintain and increase his supply of victims, Epstein, 
MAXWELL, and other Epstein employees also paid certain victims 
to recruit additional girls to be similarly abused by Epstein. 
In this way, Epstein and MAXWELL created a network of underage 
victims for him to sexually exploit. 
7. 
Between at least in or about 2001 and in or about 
2004, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, and Epstein encouraged 
and enticed one or more minor victims to engage in paid sex acts 
with Epstein through a variety of means and methods, including 
but not limited to the following: 
a. 
Epstein's employees, including, at times, 
MAXWELL, would call a victim to schedule an appointment for the 
victim to massage Epstein at his Palm Beach Residence. MAXWELL 
placed at least some of those calls while with Epstein in 
EFTA00013402
--- PAGE 6 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 187 Filed 03/29/21 Page 6 of 24 
Manhattan, New York. Epstein would often travel from New York 
to Florida, where he would then have the scheduled appointments. 
b. 
When a victim initially arrived at the Palm 
Beach Residence, she would be greeted by an employee of 
Epstein's, including, at times, MAXWELL. The victim would then 
be escorted to a room with a massage table. Once inside, the 
victim would provide a nude or semi-nude massage for EPSTEIN, 
who would himself typically be naked. During these encounters, 
EPSTEIN would escalate the nature and scope of the physical 
contact to include sex acts such as groping and direct and 
indirect contact with the victim's genitals. EPSTEIN would also 
typically masturbate during these encounters, ask the victim to 
touch him while he masturbated, and touch the victim's genitals 
with his hands or with sex toys. 
c. 
In connection with each sexual encounter, 
Epstein or one of his employees or associates, including, at 
times, MAXWELL, paid the victim in cash. Each victim was 
typically paid hundreds of dollars for each encounter. 
8. 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, facilitated 
Jeffrey Epstein's access to minor victims knowing that he had a 
sexual preference for underage girls and that he intended to 
engage in sexual activity with those victims. Epstein's 
resulting abuse of minor victims included, among other things, 
touching a victim's breast, touching a victim's genitals, 
EFTA00013403
--- PAGE 7 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 187 Filed 03/29/21 Page 7 of 24 
placing a sex toy such as a vibrator on a victim's genitals, 
directing a victim to touch Epstein while he masturbated, and 
directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. 
MAXWELL AND EPSTEIN'S VICTIMS 
9. 
Among the victims induced or enticed by GHISLAINE 
MAXWELL, the defendant, were minor victims identified herein as 
Minor Victim-1, Minor Victim-2, Minor Victim-3, and Minor 
Victim-4. In particular, and during time periods relevant to 
this Indictment, MAXWELL engaged in the following acts, among 
others, with respect to minor victims: 
a. 
MAXWELL met Minor Victim-1 when Minor 
Victim-1 was approximately 14 years old. MAXWELL subsequently 
interacted with Minor Victim-1 on multiple occasions at 
Epstein's residences, knowing that Minor Victim-1 was under the 
age of 18 at the time. During these interactions, which took 
place between approximately 1994 and 1997, MAXWELL groomed Minor 
Victim-1 to engage in sexual acts with Epstein through multiple 
means. First, MAXWELL and Epstein attempted to befriend Minor 
Victim-1, taking her to the movies and on shopping trips. 
MAXWELL also asked Minor Victim-1 about school, her classes, her 
family, and other aspects of her life. MAXWELL then sought to 
normalize inappropriate and abusive conduct by, among other 
things, undressing in front of Minor Victim-1 and being present 
when Minor Victim-1 undressed in front of Epstein. Within the 
EFTA00013404
--- PAGE 8 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 187 Filed 03/29/21 Page 8 of 24 
first year after MAXWELL and Epstein met Minor Victim-1, Epstein 
began sexually abusing Minor Victim-1. MAXWELL was present for 
and involved in some of this abuse. In particular, MAXWELL 
involved Minor Victim-1 in group sexualized massages of Epstein. 
During those group sexualized massages, MAXWELL and/or Minor 
Victim-1 would engage in sex acts with Epstein. Epstein and 
MAXWELL both encouraged Minor Victim-1 to travel to Epstein's 
residences in both New York and Florida. As a result, Minor 
Victim-1 was sexually abused by Epstein in both New York and 
Florida. Minor Victim-1 was enticed to travel across state 
lines for the purpose of sexual encounters with Epstein, and 
MAXWELL was aware that Epstein engaged in sexual activity with 
Minor Victim-1 after Minor-Victim-1 traveled to Epstein's 
prcperties, including in the context of a sexualized massage. 
b. 
MAXWELL interacted with Minor Victim-2 on at 
least one occasion in or about 1996 at Epstein's residence in 
New Mexico when Minor Victim-2 was under the age of 18. Minor 
Victim-2 had flown into New Mexico from out of state at 
Epstein's invitation for the purpose of being groomed for and/or 
subjected to acts of sexual abuse. MAXWELL knew that Minor 
Victim-2 was under the age of 18 at the time. While in New 
Mexico, MAXWELL and Epstein took Minor Victim-2 to a movie and 
MAXWELL took Minor Victim-2 shopping. MAXWELL also discussed 
Minor Victim-2's school, classes, and family with Minor Victim-
EFTA00013405
--- PAGE 9 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 187 Filed 03/29/21 Page 9 of 24 
2. In New Mexico, MAXWELL began her efforts to groom Minor 
Victim-2 for abuse by Epstein by, among other things, providing 
an unsolicited massage to Minor Victim-2, during which Minor 
Victim-2 was topless. MAXWELL also encouraged Minor Victim-2 to 
massage Epstein. 
c. 
MAXWELL groomed and befriended Minor 
Victim-3 in London, England between approximately 1994 and 1995, 
including during a period of time in which MAXWELL knew that 
Minor Victim-3 was under the age of 18. Among other things, 
MAXWELL discussed Minor Victim-3's life and family with Minor 
Victim-3. MAXWELL introduced Minor Victim-3 to Epstein and 
arranged for multiple interactions between Minor Victim-3 and 
Epstein. During those interactions, MAXWELL encouraged Minor 
Victim-3 to massage Epstein, knowing that Epstein would engage 
in sex acts with Minor Victim-3 during those massages. Minor 
Victim-3 provided Epstein with the requested massages, and 
during those massages, Epstein sexually abused Minor Victim-3. 
MAXWELL was aware that Epstein engaged in sexual activity with 
Minor Victim-3 on multiple occasions, including at times when 
Minor Victim-3 was under the age of 18, including in the context 
of a sexualized massage. 
d. 
Minor Victim-4 was recruited to provide 
Epstein with sexualized massages for which Minor Victim-4 was 
paid by Epstein and/or one of his associates, including, at 
EFTA00013406

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 187 Filed 03/29/21 Page 10 of 24 
times, MAXWELL, at the Palm Beach Residence beginning in or 
around 2001. MAXWELL met Minor Victim-4 at Epstein's Palm Beach 
Residence when Minor Victim-4 was approximately 14 years old. 
MAXWELL subsequently interacted with Minor Victim-4 on multiple 
occasions at Epstein's Palm Beach Residence, knowing that Minor 
Victim-4 was under the age of 18 at the time. During these 
interactions, which took place between approximately 2001 and 
2004, MAXWELL groomed Minor Victim-4 to engage in sexual acts 
with Epstein through multiple means. For example, MAXWELL asked 
Minor Victim-4 about her family and other aspects of her life. 
MAXWELL also sought to normalize inappropriate and abusive 
conduct by, among other things, discussing sexual topics in 
front of Minor Victim-4 and being present when Minor Victim-4 
was nude in the massage room of the Palm Beach Residence. On 
multiple occasions between approximately 2001 and 2004, Minor 
Victim-4 provided nude massages to Epstein at the Palm Beach 
Residence, during which Epstein engaged in multiple sex acts 
with Minor Victim-4. Epstein's employees, including at times 
MAXWELL, called Minor Victim-4, including from New York, to 
schedule appointments for Minor Victim-4 to massage Epstein. 
After each massage, Epstein or one of his employees, including 
at times MAXWELL, paid Minor Victim-4 hundreds of dollars in 
cash. At some point during this period, both Epstein and 
MAXWELL invited Minor Victim-4 to travel with Epstein and 
EFTA00013407
--- PAGE 11 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 187 Filed 03/29/21 Page 11 of 24 
offered to assist Minor Victim-4 with obtaining a passport for 
purposes of such travel, but Minor Victim-4 declined the 
invitation. On multiple occasions between approximately 2001 
and 2004, Epstein's employees, including at times MAXWELL, sent 
Minor Victim-4 gifts, including lingerie, from an address in 
Manhattan, New York to Minor Victim-4's residence in Florida. 
Epstein and MAXWELL each also encouraged Minor Victim-4 to 
recruit other young females to provide sexualized massages to 
Epstein. In response, Minor Victim-4 brought multiple females, 
including girls under the age of 18, to provide sexualized 
massages for Epstein at the Palm Beach Residence. On such 
occasions, both Minor Victim-4 and the girl she brought were 
paid hundreds of dollars in cash. 
MAXWELL'S EFFORTS TO CONCEAL HER CONDUCT 
10. In or around 2016, in the context of a deposition 
as part of civil litigation, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant,

abuse of minor victims by Jeffrey Epstein, including some of the 
specific events and acts of ab..:se detailed above.

others, were committed in the Southern District of New York and 
elsewhere: 
a. 
Between in or about 2001 and in or about 
2004, Epstein and MAXWELL recruited Minor Victim-4 to engage in 
sex acts with EPSTEIN at the Palm Beach Residence, after which 
Epstein and, at times, MAXWELL provided Minor Victim-4 with 
hundreds of dollars in cash for each encounter. Minor Victim-4 
truthfully told both Epstein and MAXWELL her age. 
b. 
Between in or about 2001 and in or about 
2004, Epstein and MAXWELL both encouraged and enticed Minor 
Victim-4 to recruit other girls to engage in paid sex acts with 
Epstein, which she did. 
c. 
Between in or about 2001 and in or about 
2004, Epstein's employees, including at times MAXWELL, sent

I know you mentioned you'd be at the evidence garage on Wednesday. While you are there, can 
you check on some of the below items? 
Can you find out what the NY Cart numbers are for 18 53 and 1B 57? I have one number 024329. 
I'm not sure which one this is associated to and what the other one is. 
Also, can you check on 1B 29, 1B 30, and 18 32 to see if they were processed or are they duplicates? 
If they are duplicates, which 18 are each of them a duplicate of? 
Can you also pull 1B 35, 1B 36, 18 37, 1B 38, 1B 39, and 1B 40 and see what each of their Cart 
numbers are? 
I will be out next week. I'll be six hours ahead of you timewise, so feel free to call me if there are 
questions or you'd like to talk through. I cc'd Kelly here as someone who will be in the office if you 
have questions. I filled her in as well so she should be able to help you if questions arise.

draft for you this afternoon, in the hopes of sending the draft to defense counsel tonight as part of the meet-and-confer 
directed by Judge Nathan. I think that leaves sufficient time for filing tomorrow. 
Although we're mindful of third party privacy interests, for non-parties who are neither witnesses nor victims in the case, I 
do have concerns about entertaining redaction/intervention requests, given the high volume of people who may ask to be 
heard or assert a right to review and redact documents if this were entertained.

Thank you for the call and the update on the Epstein investigation with regard to charging Ghislaine Maxwell.

To rehash some of the points regarding Maxwell to get 
up to speed with the latest: 
SDNY is close to a final decision on charging Maxwell regarding her complicity in Epstein's sex trafficking 
FBI believes (as of January) that Maxwell is still living with a friend in the Boston suburb of Manchester by the Sea 
Confirmed by historical pen register with cell site location and subpoenas to Amazon for delivery location 
Since traditional surveillance, including a pole camera, are not suitable due to the secluded location, and in order to 
get more recent information, you propose getting a renewed pen register and Amazon subpoena. Additionally, you 
and the team may seek to get a mail cover. 
M, It was a pleasure working with you, 
and the team for the last several months. 
Good luck moving forward with the case. 
Best regards,

Unfortunately I don't think this is very helpful to us. Did you take a look at the example spreadsheet I sent on 2/24? The 
excel file you sent has descriptions that don't match up to the items listed in the search warrant returns (that we sent on 
2/23), and we don't have the 1B or CART numbers to be able to cross-reference. We also can't tell what you mean by 
"loose media" without a specific comparison to what was seized, we don't know which items you're referring to as 
"Windows machines," and we can't tell whether the entirety of any particular item has been transferred, or just partial. 
For example, it looks like we have gotten very, very few image files, which is surprising. 
We have also encountered some very significant problems in trying to review the more than 1 million documents we 
recently received: 
The data we've received has no way to put any emails and attachments together. So if an email says, "see the 
attached flight records," for example, we have no way of linking that up with the records themselves. Not only is 
that a big problem for us in review, it's going to be a huge problem for producing the documents to defense 
counsel. 
The load file has no link to the native file, so when we load the data to the database, there's no way to have the 
native files show up in the database. Because many of the files are too large to open in the viewer, it effectively 
means that there are many files that are completely invisible to us. 
Related, the control numbers in the load file don't match up to the native files. So we have two sets of numbers 
and no way to match up anything—that is, even if we were to try to go hunt down every individual large file in the 
native files, it would be impossible. 
So the data that we most recently got, we need to get in a form that addresses those issues, and we likely will need to get 
a similar reproduction of the data we received a couple months ago. Otherwise we're sifting through more than a million 
documents without much rhyme or reason. 
I've re-attached the spreadsheet we sent last week — I think that's a good place to start in terms of our necessary record-
keeping, and we need that info at the very least, as well as anything else you think would be useful. Also attaching the SW 
returns for reference. And again, we're happy to meet up anytime and hash all this out in person if that's useful.

Here is a listing of what I have already handed over in load files to the US Attorney's Office for taint review. Some points of 
clarification: There were 9 IDE hard drives found in the Manhattan apartment, they turned out to be 3 copies of 3 drives 
(9 drives in total) from a July 2007 search on one of his properties. I only processed 3 (as they were all copies). All the 
loose media from the NY apartment is included. All the Windows machines from the NY apartment are included. Only 2 
Macs from NY and 1 from the Island are included. 
I will have to more closely coordinate with whoever is loading up Relativity with the remaining Macs as the tool 
they have to be processed with does not easily re-name the load files. 
Spreadsheet is attached.

Totally understand about the network issues—we can relate. I do still think it will be helpful to all sit down together to 
have an in-person discussion, to make sure everybody is on the same page. Are folks available for that next week? And 
what I think would be most helpful to facilitate that would be a spreadsheet of each separate device referenced in the two 
search warrant returns, with columns for whether we've dumped the contents, whether they've been reviewed and/or 
transferred, what portions were transferred, etc. 
Something roughly like the attached, with any other categories you think would be useful — and the info on the attached is 
mostly hypothetical, obviously, just as examples. That will help us fully understand what's been reviewed, transferred, 
and received so far, and what remains. 
(Also just on the pictures, we do want copies of those as well, please including from the discs and the devices — I think FBI 
was going to do an initial screen to make sure no CP, and since I think the answer was no, we'll need to get those to be 
able to review them as well.)

Sony for the delayed response. They are tearing out our old network and giving us a new one, they mandated we 
delete old stuff (about 400 TB worth). Now that they are working on replacing the network, we can do only local 
work. I should be able to give you an accounting of what is what. I can say, off the top of my head, that all 
windows based items from the NY search have been handed over as well as all loose media. The CDs from NY

Following up on the below from last weekend, I'm still not sure how we're addressing this so I thought it would make 
sense for us to all schedule a (hopefully relatively brief) meeting to all get on the same page? We didn't hear back on 
which files had previously been provided, but our tech folks did their best to differentiate, and we got access to the 
materials yesterday and its well over a million documents, and we don't have any idea what we're looking at — i.e., which 
devices the materials came from, whether it's full or partial results, how many more devices we have coming, etc. 
Based on the attached search warrant returns, it looks like from the New York mansion (the PDF) there are approximately 
devices that would have storage (computers, hard drives, thumb drives, etc.) and that's not even counting at least 60+ 
CDs. And then from the Virgin Islands (the Excel spreadsheet), at least more than 25 devices, including multiple servers / 
server racks. 
So we gotta know what we've already received, what remains, anticipated schedule, etc, and I know it's a lot of moving 
pieces on all sides so wanted to loop in everybody at once. The case team will be in California this coming week from 
Tuesday through Friday, but then I think generally around the first week of March, which will hopefully be plenty of time 
to schedule a productive meeting.

I'm not sure who's the exact right person to ask this, so wanted to get everybody on one email chain about it — I have the 
hard drive that 
dropped off that has new Epstein search warrant materials, but it looks like there are also old 
materials (that I think we had previously received and uploaded??) on the hard drive, and so I'm not sure what's new. 
Just generally, and 
and I talked about this last week too, but it's basically impossible for us to keep track of what 
we're getting, and what has been completed, without some kind of identification or labeling system, along with a list of 
which devices have been extracted and downloaded. 
So for example on the hard drive currently, there are 38 folders labeled "loadFiles" through "37loadFiles" with a modified 
date of 11/14/19, which I think we may have already previously received — but I'm not sure, because we haven't gotten 
any info on which folders match up to which devices, etc. And then there's another folder titled "NYCO24362" that has a 
EFTA00013453
--- PAGE 7 ---
modified date of 1/27/20, so I think that may be the materials we hadn't previously received? That folder by itself has 
more than 600,000 items. 
I don't want to give 
anything that we've already previously received and uploaded, and I can't tell from the folder or 
file names whether everything on the drive is new, or whether just additional materials were saved onto it in addition to 
what we already have. =, 
are you able to give us some guidance on this? Ultimately what we really need is a 
spreadsheet of every device, whether it's been dumped (or partially dumped), and then identifying that same info —
which device, and what materials from it — are being given to us with each data transfer. Otherwise I think 
organizationally and for review purposes it will be a total disaster for us. 
We're happy to have a meeting on this if that's helpful — and thanks everybody for the assistance.

Confirmed by historical pen register with cell site location and subpoenas to Amazon for delivery location 
Since traditional surveillance, including a pole camera, are not suitable due to the secluded location, and in order to get 
more recent information, you propose getting a renewed pen register and Amazon subpoena. Additionally, you and the 
team may seek to get a mail cover. 
M
,
It was a pleasure working with you, 
and the team for the last several months. 
Good luck moving forward with the case. 
Best regards, 
Supervisory Special Agent 
FBI New York

I've been asked to set up a call with all of you and the brass for tomorrow. 11am or 1pm would work best for them.

Subject: RE: Epstein 
Hi 
Funny you should ask. I have been wondering the same thing. Here is the term sheet and guidelines calculation 
that we provided at the last meeting. You and MI and I had also discussed a possible federal plea to an Information 
charging a 371 conspiracy, with a Rule 11 plea with a two-year cap, but I think 
must have asked Alex about it and it 
was nixed. Just to be prepared for tomorrow, I was just starting to draft a Rule 11 plea agreement in case Alex changes his 
mind and a formal non-prosecution agreement containing the state plea terms. As soon as those are ready, I will e-mail 
them to you. 
There are three concerns that I hope we can address tomorrow. First, that there is an absolute drop-dead date for accepting 
or rejecting because it is strategically important that we indict before the end of September, which means presenting the 
indictment on September 25th. Second, the agents and I have not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which as 
politely reminded me, is required under the law. And third, I do not want to make any promises about allowing 
Epstein to self-surrender because I still believe that we have a good chance of getting him detained. 
On another note, Junior got a call today from the Palm Beach Police Chief because he got information that there will be an 
article released tomorrow about our meeting and that Epstein is going to plead to a state charge and the Chief wanted to 
know if the victims had been consulted about the deal. There has been some coverage in the New York press about Ken 
Starr, but I haven't seen anything local yet.

The United States has the right to assign to an independent third-party the responsibility for consulting with

If the United States elects to assign this responsibility to an independent third-party, the United States retains the

The United States will assign to an independent third-party, who shall be appointed subject to the good faith approval of Epstein's 
counsel, the responsibility for consulting with and, subject to the good faith approval of Epstein's counsel, selecting the attorney 
representative for the victims. The United States retains the right to submit to the independent third-party a written statement, 
disclosed to and approved by Epstein, that will set forth in general terms the role of any attorney representative in negotiating a

settlement for any claimant and the further role of advising such potential claimants of their alternative right to retain their own counsel 
for the purposes of separate litigation. 
I made it "will assign" because I understood that you didn't actually want to pick the lawyer and that you wanted judge davis, or 
someone like him, to select the lawyer. 
The other edits should be clear to you in terms of what I am trying to safeguard, but I would be happy to discuss with you later this pm.

Jay, 
Pursuant to our conversation. Thanks, 
IN RE: 
INVESTIGATION OF 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN 
ADDENDUM TO THE NON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENT 
IT APPEARING that the parties seek to clarify certain provisions of page 4, paragraph 7 of the Non-Prosecution 
Agreement (hereinafter "paragraph 7"), that agreement is modified as follows: 
1. 
The United States has the right to assign to an independent third-party, the responsibility for consulting 
with and, subject to the good faith approval of Epstein's counsel, selecting the attorney representative for the 
victims. If the United States elects to assign this responsibility to an independent third-party, the United States 
retains the right to request that the independent third-party also consult with the United States. 
2. 
Pursuant to paragraph 7, Epstein has agreed to pay the fees of the attorney representative. This provision, 
however, shall not obligate Epstein to pay the fees and costs of contested litigation filed against him. Thus, if 
after consideration of potential settlements, the attorney representative elects to file a contested lawsuit pursuant 
to 18 U.S.C. s 2255 or elects to pursue any other contested remedy, the paragraph 7 obligation to pay the costs of 
the attorney representative, as opposed to any statutory or other obligations to pay reasonable attorneys fees and 
costs such as those contained in s 2255 to bear the costs of the attorney representative, shall cease. 
EFTA00013500
--- PAGE 3 ---
By signing this Addendum, Epstein asserts and certifies that the above has been read and 
explained to him. Epstein hereby states that he understands the clarifications to the Non-
Prosecution Agreement and agrees to comply with them.

breakfast Friday. It was great to catch up. 
Following up on our conversation about the date for Mr. 
Epstein's plea, where you said that you didn't want to 
dictate a schedule to the state, as we discussed I have 
a case where I represent an individual who is now the 
lead witness for the government, and openings are set 
for next week. Accordingly, I have now confirmed with 
Mr. Epstein's Florida counsel that the state's 
attorney's office and the court will be available to 
have him enter his plea on November 20. So we will 
plan to proceed on one that date. Please confirm that 
this is ok.

Thank you, 
On another FYI — FBI Seattle and FBI Las Vegas executed a search today on a warehouse owned by Epstein's favorite 
cohort, David Copperfield, in connection with allegations that Copperfield raped an adult female. Copperfield spoke with the 
girls at Epstein's home on several occasions and tickets with "backstage passes" were a favorite "birthday gift" for Epstein to 
give the girls. I askede 
contact the case agent to just stay in touch.

M- FYI -- The story of the lawsuit filed by the girl in New York has made the national news (it was on Fox News several 
times today and it is on ABC News' website). I think that may be the real reason for the delay in the change of plea. 
Epstein's group is concerned that the guilty plea will be used against him in civil suits and they want to knock that lawsuit 
out before the guilty plea to deter others. One of the newspapers also reported that Epstein's camp had planted the false 
stories about girls who "just sat in his kitchen" filing suit in an attempt to discredit the girls.

Hi 
Has the special master made his selection yet? Several of the girls are getting calls from attorneys, and they 
have been seeing all the news and are concerned. If the selection has not yet been made, may I call Judge Davis and ask 
the status of the decision? 
Thank you.

Jay, 
The Judge Davis issue is a non-starter. We've beaten that horse to death. Regarding your contention that "the attorney 
representative be told clearly that Mr. Epstein has agreed to pay the lawyer's hourly rate only for the time he or she spends 
working to effectuate settlements for the identified women," Alex and I agree that paragraph 7C is sufficient, Regarding the 
other points, we have made the following concessions: 
1. Regarding the language concerning a lawyer whose firm is sizeable enough to litigate multiple trials simultaneously, I 
have removed paragraph 4 on page 3 of the letter. 
2. Regarding the 150k statutory limit language, I have included a footnote which should satisfy your concern. 
3. Regarding language there may be discovery to test the claims of alleged "victims", please see new paragraph 4 on 
page 3 which now states as criteria that the firm should have "Experience litigating against large law firms and high profile 
attorneys who may test the veracity of the victims' claims." 
I have attached the Addendum and the revised letter to Judge Davis. Jay, this needs to be concluded. Alex and I believe 
that this is as far as we can go. Therefore, please advise me whether we have a deal no later than COB tomorrow, 
Tuesday, October 23, 2007. Thanks,

I have reviewed your proposed language and wanted to raise a few areas of concern. 
First, I am not sure why we are not just asking Judge Davis to represent these women. If he is available, that would save 
us a whole additional layer of process. I had thought that was initially the idea. I am not sure why you seem to be moving 
in another direction. 
I also cannot understand why the draft affirmatively requests that J Davis select a lawyer whose firm is sizeable enough to 
litigate multiple trials simultaneously. That seems to be directly at odds with the purpose of the agreement, which is to 
facilitate out of court settlements. Indeed, to the extent any woman were to elect to bring an action against Mr. Epstein, 
she would not only be free to select any lawyer of her choice, but would be restricted from using the lawyer representative 
in this capacity due to the conflicts of interests that would cause. This part of your proposed language is of signficiant 
concern to me. 
Your letter also indicates the 150k statutory limit without reference to the pre-existing 50G limit. To be sure, any of the 
women are free to seek whatever settlement they want, but given the question that exists about the statutory amount, the 
letter should not state definitely that it will be 150k. 
EFTA00013508
--- PAGE 2 ---
In addition, you have omitted a few important items from your proposal. Given that Judge Davis or any other potential 
attorney representative should understand the scope of the work, the language should make clear that there may be 
discovery to test the claims of alleged "victims." 
Finally, I think it is important that the attorney representative be told clearly that Mr. Epstein has agreed to pay the lawyer's 
hourly rate only for the time he or she spends working to effectuate settlements for the identified women.

Re: Service as a Special Master 
Dear Judge Davis: 
Thank you for agreeing to serve as a Special Master and for assisting the United States 
Attorney's Office in the selection of an attorney representative to represent a group of identified 
victims. This letter is meant to assist you in performing your duties by providing you with 
background information regarding the agreement between the United States and Jeffrey Epstein 
and the duties that the attorney representative will have to perform. 
The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Attorney's Office conducted an 
investigation of Mr. Epstein. As a result of that investigation, the U.S. Attorney's Office and Mr. 
Epstein entered into a Non-Prosecution Agreement and an Addendum that contains, inter alia , 
the following terms: 
7A. The United States has the right to assign to an independent third-party the 
responsibility for consulting with and, subject to the good faith approval of 
Epstein's counsel, selecting the attorney representative for the individuals identified 
under the Agreement. If the United States elects to assign this responsibility to an 
independent third-party, both the United States and Epstein retain the right to make 
good faith objections to the attorney representative suggested by the independent 
third-party prior to the final designation of the attorney representative. 
7B. The parties will jointly prepare a short written submission to the independent 
third-party regarding the role of the attorney representative and regarding Epstein's 
Agreement to pay such attorney representative his or her regular customary hourly 
rate for representing such victims subject to the provisions of paragraph 7C, infra. 
7C. Pursuant to additional paragraph 7A, Epstein has agreed to pay the fees of the 
attorney representative selected by the independent third party. This provision, 
however, shall not obligate Epstein to pay the fees and costs of contested litigation 
filed against him. Thus, if after consideration of potential settlements, an attorney 
representative elects to file a contested lawsuit pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2255 or 
elects to pursue any other contested remedy, the paragraph 7 obligation of the 
Agreement to pay the costs of the attorney representative, as opposed to any 
statutory or other obligations to pay reasonable attorneys fees and costs such as 
those contained in § 2255 to bear the costs of the attorney representative, shall 
cease. 
8.If any of the individuals referred to [in the paragraphs above] elects to file suit 
pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2255, Epstein will not contest the jurisdiction of the United 
States District Court for the Southern District of Florida over his person and/or the 
subject matter, and Epstein waives his right to contest liability and also waives his 
EFTA00013511
--- PAGE 2 ---
right to contest damages up to an amount agreed to between Epstein and the 
identified individual, so long as the identified individual elects to proceed 
exclusively under 18 U.S.C. § 2255, and agrees to waive any other claim for 
damages, whether pursuant to state, federal, or common law. Notwithstanding this 
waiver, with respect to those individuals whose names appear on the list provided 
by the United States, Epstein's signature on this agreement, his waivers and failures 
to contest liability and such damages in any suit are not to be construed as an 
admission of any criminal or civil liability. 
9.Epstein's signature on this agreement also is not to be construed admission of 
civil or criminal liability or a waiver of any jurisdictional or other defense as to any 
person whose name does not appear on the list provided by the United States. 
10.Except as to those individuals who elect to proceed exclusively under 18 U.S.C. 
§ 2255, as set forth in [the above paragraphs], neither Epstein's signature on this 
agreement, nor its terms, nor any resulting waivers or settlements by Epstein are to 
be construed as admissions or evidence of civil or criminal liability or a waiver of 
any jurisdictional or other defense as to any person, whether or not her name 
appears on the list provided by the United States. 
The most recent version of the statute referenced above, 18 U.S.C. § 2255, provides that: 
Any person who, while a minor, was a victim of a violation of section . . . 2422 or 
2423 of this title and who suffers personal injury as a result of such violation, 
regardless of whether the injury occurred while such person was a minor, may sue 
in any appropriate United States District Court and shall recover the actual 
damages such person sustains and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable 
attorney's fee. Any person as described in the preceding sentence shall be deemed 
to have sustained damages of no less than $150,000 in value. a 
Section 2422 prohibits the use of a facility of interstate commerce to induce minors to 
engage in sexual activity and prostitution, and section 2423 prohibits interstate travel for the 
purpose of engaging in sexual activity or prostitution with minors . The United States has 
identified 
victims as defined by this statute. 
Due to the circumstances of the case and the number and caliber of the attorneys who 
represent Mr. Epstein, in selecting the victims' attorney representative, the United States suggests 
that you consider the following criteria: 
I. Experience doing both plaintiffs' and defense litigation. 
I. Experience with state and federal statutory and common law tort claims. 
I. The ability to communicate effectively with young women (the victims' current ages are 
between 16 and 24). 
I. Experience litigating against large law firms and high profile attorneys who may test the 
veracity of the victims' claims. 
I. Sensitivity to the nature of the suit and the victims' interest in maintaining their privacy. 
I. Experience litigating in federal court in the Southern District of Florida. 
I. The resources to hire experts and others, while working on a contingency fee basis, in 
order to prepare for trial, if a settlement cannot be reached. 
I. The ability to negotiate effectively. 
Pursuant to this letter, the United States assigns to you the responsibility for consulting 
with and selecting the attorney representative for the individuals. The United States and Epstein 
retain the right to make good faith objections to the attorney representative you select prior to the 
final designation of the attorney representative. In that regard, after you have reached a decision 
EFTA00013512

regarding the attorney representative, please provide me with his or her name

Good evening. I am the ASA with the Epstein case in Palm Beach County. The negotiated settlement is a 
definite go. A difficulty arose last week at a conference with the judge on the case. She wants the plea and 
sentence to occur concurrently; not a plea with a sentencing at a later date. Therefore, the case was set for the 
first week of January, but the plea and sentence will definitely occur before the January 4th date that was agreed 
on by all for the sentencing.

Jay, 
Regarding your statement that "we are beginning to think about what discovery we may need to take to 
verify any claims", I remind you that paragraph 8 of the agreement states that Epstein "waives his right to 
contest liability and also waives his right to contest damages up to an amount as agreed to between the identified 
individual and Epstein, so long as the identified individual elects to proceed exclusively under 18 USC s 2255 
and agrees to waive any other claim for damages ... ." That being said, you are correct in assuming that we do 
not want to be copied on anything related to discovery. Monitoring the status of the negotiations/litigation by this 
Office is limited to insuring that the terms and conditions of the Non-Prosecution Agreement are not breached.

I haven't heard anything from Judge Davis. I assume he is still willing to take on the role you asked him to take on, but can you please 
let me know if that is not the case? 
Also, we are beginning to think about what discovery we may need to take to verify any claims. I am assuming that your office does 
not want to be copied on any subpoenas or anything related to discovery. But please let me know if that is an incorrect assumption. 
Thanks - Jay

Hi 
Here is my suggestion: 
Dear 
The FBI has informed us that a case disposition conference has been set in the Epstein case on 
January , 008. Our agreement with Mr. Epstein contemplated a simultaneous plea and sentencing for October 
(or, as we later agreed, November), followed by Mr. Epstein self-surrendering to begin serving his sentence not 
later than January 4, 2008. From your last e-mail, it appeared that the judge was under the impression that Mr. 
Epstein could not be sentenced before January 2008. We are hoping that Judge McSorley would consider 
conducting the simultaneous plea and sentencing some time before January 4, 2008, so that Mr. Epstein can 
comply with the terms of our agreement and begin serving his sentence on January 4, 2008. 
I also would appreciate it if you could send me a copy of the plea agreement, the Information that you plan to file 
(if it hasn't been filed already), and any factual proffer or other documents related to the plea. Please also let me 
know the date and time of the plea and sentencing so that someone from our office can attend and insure Mr. 
Epstein's compliance with the terms of his federal non-prosecution agreement. 
If you need any information regarding the federal investigation, or if you have any questions about 
s of 
iliiiir 
the federal non-prosecution agreement, please do not hesitate to contact me at the number below o 
'n the 
West Palm Beach office. 
Thank you.

Dealing 
I was just informed that a case disposition conference has been set in the Epstein case on January 7, 2008. Our 
agreement with Mr. Epstein contemplated a simultaneous plea and sentencing for October (or, as we later agreed, 
November), followed by Mr. Epstein self-surrendering to begin serving his sentence not later than January 4, 
2008. From your last e-mail, it appeared that the judge was under the impression that Mr. Epstein could not be 
sentenced before January 2008. We are hoping that Judge McSorley would consider conducting the 
simultaneous plea and sentencing some time before January 4, 2008, so that Mr. Epstein can comply with the 
terms of our agreement and begin serving his sentence on January 4, 2008. 
I also would appreciate it if you could send me a copy of the plea agreement, the Information that you plan to file 
(if it hasn't been filed already), and any factual proffer or other documents related to the plea. Please also let me 
know the date and time of the plea and sentencing so that someone from our office can attend and insure Mr. 
Epstein's compliance with the terms of his federal non-prosecution agreement. 
If you need any information regarding the federal investigation, or if you have any questions about the terms of 
the federal non-prosecution agreement, please do not hesitate to contact me at the number below or

Good evening. I am the ASA with the Epstein case in Palm Beach County. The negotiated settlement is a 
definite go. A difficulty arose last week at a conference with the judge on the case. She wants the plea and 
sentence to occur concurrently; not a plea with a sentencing at a later date. Therefore, the case was set for the 
first week of January, but the plea and sentence will definitely occur before the January 4th date that was agreed 
on by all for the sentencing. 
If you have any questions, please contact me at

Epstein believes that January 4th not December 16th is when he'll plead guilty and be sentenced. Judging from 
email, it seems that January 4th is the date. Hopefully, Ill hear from Judge Davis today or tomorrow. Thanks,

As we discussed, and as we have confirmed, the Court

Re: 
Jeffrey Epstein 
Dear Jay: 
United States Attorney 
Southern District of Florida 
December 11, 2007 
I am writing not to respond to your asserted "policy concerns" regarding Mr. Epstein's Non-
Prosecution Agreement, which will be addressed by the United States Attorney, but the time has 
come for me to respond to the ever-increasing attacks on my role in the investigation and 
negotiations. 
It is an understatement to say that I am surprised by your allegations regarding my role 
because I thought that we had worked very well together in resolving this dispute and because I had 
described you to others as a man of integrity. I also am surprised because I feel that I bent over 
backwards to keep in mind the effect that the agreement would have on Mr. Epstein and to make 
sure that you (and he) understood the repercussions of the agreement. For example, I brought to 
your attention that one potential plea could result in no gain time for your client; I correct one of 
your calculations of the Sentencing Guidelines that would have resulted in Mr. Epstein spending far 
more time in prison than you projected; I contacted the Bureau of Prisons to see whether Mr. Epstein 
would be eligible for the prison camp that you desired; and I told you my suspicions about the 
source of the press "leak" and suggested ways to avoid the press. Importantly, I continued to work 
with you in a professional manner even after I learned that you had been proceeding in bad faith for 
several weeks — thinking that I had incorrectly concluded that solicitation of minors to engage in 
prostitution was a registrable offense and that you would "fool" our Office into letting Mr. Epstein 
plead to a non-registrable offense. Even now, when it is clear that neither you nor your client ever 
intended to abide by the terms of the agreement that he signed, I have never alleged misconduct on 
your part. 
The first allegation that you raise is that I "assiduously" hid from you the fact that Bert 
EFTA00013538
--- PAGE 2 ---
JAY P. LEFKOWITZ, ESQ. 
DECEMBER 11, 2007 
PAGE 2 OF 5 
Ocariz is a friend of my boyfriend and that I have a "longstanding relationship" with Mr. Ocariz. 
I informed you that I selected Mr. Ocariz because he was a friend and classmate of two people 
whom I respected, and that I had never met or spoken with Mr. Ocariz prior to contacting him about 
this case. All of those facts are true. I still have never met Mr. Ocariz, and, at the time that he and 
I spoke about this case, he did not know about my relationship with his friend. You suggest that I 
should have explicitly informed you that one of the referrals came from my "boyfriend" rather than 
simply a "friend," which is the term I used, but it is not my nature to discuss my personal 
relationships with opposing counsel. Your attacks on me and on the victims establish why I wanted 
to find someone whom I could trust with safeguarding the victims' best interests in the face of 
intense pressure from an unlimited number of highly skilled and well paid attorneys. Mr. Ocariz 
was that person. 
One of your letters suggests a business relationship between Mr. Ocariz and my boyfriend. 
This is patently untrue and neither my boyfriend nor I would have received any financial benefit 
from Mr. Ocariz's appointment. Furthermore, after Mr. Ocariz learned more about Mr. Epstein's 
actions (as described below), he expressed a willingness to handle the case pro bono, with no 
financial benefit even to himself. Furthermore, you were given several other options to choose from, 
including the Podhurst firm, which was later selected by Judge Davis. You rejected those other 
options. 
You also allege that I improperly disclosed information about the case to Mr. Ocariz. I 
provided Mr. Ocariz with a bare bones summary of the agreement's terms related to his appointment 
to help him decide whether the case was something he and his firm would be willing to undertake. 
I did not provide Mr. Ocariz with facts related to the investigation because they were confidential 
and instead recommended that he "Google" Mr. Epstein's name for background information. When 
Mr. Ocariz asked for additional information to assist his firm in addressing conflicts issues, I 
forwarded those questions to you, and you raised objections for the first time. I did not share any 
further information about Mr. Epstein or the case. Since Mr. Ocariz had been told that you 
concurred in his selection, out of professional courtesy, I informed Mr. Ocariz of the Office's 
decision to use a Special Master to make the selection and told him that the Office had made contact 
with Judge Davis. We have had no further contact since then and I have never had contact with 
Judge Davis. I understand from you that Mr. Ocariz contacted Judge Davis. You criticize his 
decision to do so, yet you feel that you and your co-counsel were entitled to contact Judge Davis to 
try to "lobby" him to select someone to your liking, despite the fact that the Non-Prosecution 
Agreement vested the Office with the exclusive right to select the attorney representative. 
Another reason for my surprise about your allegations regarding misconduct related to the 
Section 2255 litigation is your earlier desire to have me perform the role of "facilitator" to convince 
the victims that the lawyer representative was selected by the Office to represent their interests alone 
and that the out-of-court settlement of their claims was in their best interests. You now state that 
doing the same things that you had asked me to do earlier is improper meddling in civil litigation.

DECEMBER 11, 2007 
PAGE 3 OF 5 
Much of your letter reiterates the challenges to Detective 
investigation that have 
already been submitted to the Office on several occasions and you suggest that I have kept that 
information from those who reviewed the proposed indictment package. Contrary to your 
suggestion, those submissions were attached to and incorporated in the proposed indictment 
package, so your suggestion that I tried to hide something from the reviewers is false. I also take 
issue with the duplicity of stating that we must accept as true those parts of the 
eports and 
witness statements that you like and we must accept as false those parts that you do not like. You 
and your co-counsel also impressed upon me from the beginning the need to undertake an 
independent investigation. It seems inappropriate now to complain because our independent 
investigation uncovered facts that are unfavorable to your client. 
You complain that I "forced" your client and the State Attorney's Office to proceed on 
charges that they do not believe in, yet you do not want our Office to inform the State Attorney's 
Office of facts that su ort the additional char e nor do ou want any of the victims of that charge 
to contact Ms. 
'r 
rt. Ms. 
pinion may change if she knows the full 
ri
, 
scope of your c lent s actions. Also, it has always been nix intention to have Mr. Epstein plead to 
federal, not state, charges. You and I spent several weeks trying to identify and put together a plea 
to federal charges that your client was willing to accept. Yet your letter now accuses me of 
"manufacturing" charges of obstruction of justice, making obscene phone calls, and violating child 
privacy laws. When Mr. Mold 
you that those charges would "embarrass the Office," he meant 
that the Office was unwilling to bend the facts to satisfy Mr. Epstein's desired prison sentence — a 
statement with which I agree. 
I hope that you understand how your accusations that I imposed "ultimatums" and "forced" 
you and your client to agree to unconscionable contract terms cannot square with the true facts of 
this case. As explained in letters from Messrs. Acosta and 
the indictment was postponed 
for more than five months to allow you and Mr. Epstein's other attorneys to make presentations to 
the Office to convince the Office not to prosecute. Those presentations were unsuccessful. As you 
mention in your letter, I —a simple line AUSA — handled the primary negotiations for the Office, and 
conducted those negotiations with you, Ms. Sanchez, Mr. Lewis, and a host of other highly skilled 
and experienced practitioners. The agreement itself was signed by Mr. Epstein, Ms. Sanchez, and 
Mr. Lefcourt, whose experience speaks for itself. You and I spent hours negotiating the terms, 
including when to use "a" versus "the" and other minutiae. 
ach 
agreement, you repeatedly went over my head, involving Messrs 
and 
Acosta in the negotiations at various times. In any and all p ea nego is ions 
e e endant 
understands that his options are to plead or to continue with the investigation and proceed to trial. 
Those were the same options that were proposed to Mr. Epstein, and they are not "persecution or 
intimidation tactics." Mr. Epstein chose to sign the agreement with the advice of a multitude of 
extremely noteworthy counsel. 
You also make much of the fact that the names of the victims were not released to Mr. 
Epstein prior to signing the Agreement. You never asked for such a term. During an earlier 
EFTA00013540
--- PAGE 4 ---
JAY P. LEFKOWITZ, ESQ. 
DECEMBER 11, 2007 
PAGE 4 OF 5 
meeting, where Mr. Black was present, he raised the concern that you now voice. Mr. Black and 
I did not have a chance to discuss the issue, but I had already conceived of a way to resolve that 
issue if it were raised during negotiations. As I stated, it was not, leading me to believe that it was 
not a matter of concern to the defense. Since the signing of the Non-Prosecution Agreement, the 
agents and I have vetted the list of victims more than once. In one instance, we decided to remove 
a name because, although the minor victim was touched inappropriately by Mr. Epstein, we decided 
that the link to a payment was insufficient to call it "prostitution." I have always remained open to 
a challenge to the list, so your suggestion that Mr. Epstein was forced to write a blank check is 
simply unfounded. 
Your last set of allegations relates to the investigation of the matter. For instance, you claim 
that some of the victims were informed of their right to collect damages prior to a thorough 
investigation of their allegations against Mr. Epstein. This also is false. None of the victims was 
informed of the right to sue under Section 2255 prior to the investigation of the claims. Three 
victims were notified shortly after the signing of the Non-Prosecution Agreement of the general 
terms of that Agreement. You raised objections to any victim notification, and no further 
notifications were done. Throughout this process you have seen that I have prepared this case as 
though it would proceed to trial. Notifying the witnesses of the possibility of damages claims prior 
to concluding the matter by plea or trial would only undermine my case. If my reassurances are 
insufficient, the fact that not a single victim has threatened to sue Mr. Epstein should assure you of 
the integrity of the investigation.' 
With respect to Mss 
I contacted her attorney — who was paid for by Mr. Epstein and 
was directed by counsel for Mr. Epstein to demand immunity — and asked only whether he still 
represented Ms. 
nd if he wanted me to send the victim notification letter to him. He asked 
what the letter woad say and I told him that the letter would be fo 
g in about a week and 
that I could not provide him with the terms. With respect to Ms. 
tatus as a victim, you 
again want us to accept as true o 
that are beneficial to your c rent and to reject as false 
anything detrimental to him. Ms. 
ade a number of statements that are contradicted by 
documentary evidence and a review o 
er recorded statement shows her lack of credibility with 
respect to a number of statements. Based upon all of the evidence collected Ms. 
s classified 
as a victim as defined by statute. Of course, that does not mean that Ms. 
onsiders herself 
a victim or that she would seek damages from Mr. Epstein. I believe that a number of the identified 
victims will not seek damages, but that does not negate their legal status as victims. 
I understand that you and your co-counsel perceive a strategic advantage to removing me 
from the case, and that perhaps my willingness to allow others to speak for me emboldened your 
'There are numerous other unfounded allegations in your letter about document demands, 
the money laundering investigation, contacting potential witnesses, speaking with the press, and the 
like. These allegations have been raised and disproven earlier and need not be readdressed.

no longer continue unchecked your attack on the credibility of myself and the agents. In the future, 
I recommend that you address your accusations to me so that I can correct any misunderstandings

Jeffrey Epstein plea hearing moved to March

Thursday, January 03, 2008 
A plea hearing for part-time Palm Beacher Jeffrey Epstein will be rescheduled to March, his 
New York attorney confirmed Wednesday. 
The Manhattan money manager is expected to plead guilty to a felony charge of solicitation of 
prostitution. The hearing originally was scheduled for Friday. 
Sources have confirmed that the deal will put Epstein in prison for 18 months, followed by 
house arrest. 
"The plea conference will be moved to March, but it will be resolved, we believe," attorney 
Gerald Lefcourt said by phone. 
Although he declined to give a reason, Lefcourt said the date change was agreed to by both 
the defense and the prosecution. 
Mike Edmondson, spokesman for State Attorney Barry Krischer, declined to comment. 
"It's a matter of policy we don't comment on active cases," Edmondson said. 
In exchange for his guilty plea, federal authorities are expected to drop their probe into 
whether Epstein broke any federal laws, sources have said. 
Epstein, 54, was indicted in July 2006 on a felony charge of solicitation of prostitution. After 
completing an 11-month investigation, Palm Beach police said Epstein paid five underage 
girls for massages and sometimes sex at his El Brillo Way home. 
The investigation began after police received a call from a woman who said her 14-year-old 
stepdaughter might have been molested by a man in Palm Beach. 
Investigators watched Epstein's 7,234-square-foot waterfront home and private jet, and 
rummaged through his trash to build their case. They took sworn statements from five alleged 
victims and 17 witnesses.

Hi 
— I am hoping that you have an update from 
I wanted to fill you in on recent events. 
Yesterday we did the first half of the grand jury presentation on the indictment. Many of the grand jurors 
expressed thanks for our return. After a break as I walked into the room, I overheard one juror telling another 
that he had been concerned that we were going to "whitewash" this case and not charge it. 
E 'stein s law ers are usin! the 
il l 
'ts as an excuse to harass a number of the victims. One girl.
to be served with a 
subpoena for a deposition. It is scheduled for Monday. 
A national crime victims service organization has received a grant from the Justice Department to provide legal 
representation to victims. They have agreed to provide counsel for our victims. The only problem is that the 
lawyers are located in Maryland. But they will try to find pro bono lawyers here to help out. 
I also told 
that one of our victims tried to commit suicide last week. The FBI's victim-witness coordinator 
is doing her best to get counseling for all of our needy victims, but I just can't stress enough how important it is 
for these girls to have a resolution in this case. The "please be patient" answer is really wearing thin, especially 
when Epstein's group is still on the attack while we are forced to wait on the sidelines. 
Thank you.

• 
In response to the possible further delay in the prosecution of Mr. Epstein, we have listed below the reasons why this would 
have a negative impact on the Government's case: 
The statute of limitations issue is the state statute of limitations. According to Detective 
the statute of limitations is 
three years from the time of reporting. The statute of limitations will begin to expire in Fall 2008 for five of the 16 victims 
listed in the indictment. The issue is implicated in two ways. First, because of the state's leniency for the first set of girls, the 
additional girls have been presented only to us for prosecution. If we cannot go forward, then there will be no prosecution of 
those crimes. (In response to the argument that Joe should just present them now, we believe that some of the victims are 
unknown to the defense and disclosing them further weakens our case by allowing them to depose and harass those 
victims.) Second, our "state resolution" of the case requires Mr. Epstein to plead to something that hasn't been charged yet 
so further delay will allow him to escape one of the terms of the deal he signed several months ago. (There is also a statute 
of limitations on the private cause of action under 2255 pursuant to which he must pay damages to the girls. The delay will 
allow him to escape responsibility for that term, too.) 
Other reasons: 
The victims are getting older. Clearly one of Mr. Epstein's arguments will be that he did not know they were minors. The older 
they are when they testify the more plausible Epstein's argument becomes. 
Several of the victims have relocated to other areas of the country which may become difficult should the case proceed to 
trial. 
The girls deserve swift justice so they can move on with their lives. The continued delay has had profound effects upon many 
of their lives 
is just one example). 
The delay so far has led many of the victims to reach out to private lawyers which, in turn, let's Mr. Epstein's counsel argue 
that they are only in it for money. 
The grand jury we are using will expire soon. We have already presented more than a dozen hours of testimony and the 
grand jury is invested and wants to indict. 
Why give him more time? He has already been afforded more than a year's delay. This is not a white collar or other non-
violent crime. This is a child exploitation crime with more than 20 known child victims. We are mandated by statute and DOJ 
policy to prosecute those cases vigorously and in a timely fashion - whether the children were prostitutes or unwilling victims. 
the state trial for Mr. Epstein is set for early July 2008. I'm unsure of the legal issues that may arise from the 
state prosecution and the effect they may have on the federal prosecution. Thank you for the updates and please let us know 
if we can be of further assistance.

This Office has completed a thorough review of the U.S. Attorney's handling of the matter 
involving your client, Jeffrey Epstein. We have received and reviewed your letters of May 19, 
June 3 and June 19, 2008, the attachments to the June 19 letter, as well as your submissions to 
the Criminal Division and the U.S. Attorney's Office. Additionally, we have reviewed an 
extensive set of materials provided by the U.S. Attorney's Office and conferred with a number of 
highly experienced Department attorneys about this matter. The Deputy Attorney General has 
also been briefed. 
As you know, the Department of Justice vests considerable discretion in its U.S. Attorneys, and 
the Deputy Attorney General will intervene in only the most unusual of circumstances. We do 
not believe such intervention is warranted here. Even if we were to substitute our judgment for 
that of the U.S. Attorney, we believe that federal prosecution of this case is appropriate. 
Moreover, having reviewed your allegations of prosecutorial misconduct, and the facts 
underlying them, we see nothing in the conduct of the U.S. Attorney's Office that gives us any 
reason to alter our opinion. 
Sincerely, Itm

NOTICE OF CONTINUED PENDENCY 
OF FEDERAL CRIMINAL ACTION 
Defendant Jeffrey Epstein hereby notifies the Court of the continued 
pendency of a federal criminal action against him, stating as follows: 
On June 30, 2008, after defendant Jeffrey Epstein filed his motion to stay 
IDE 121, he was sentenced in the state-court criminal case described in that motion 
(State of Florida v. Jeffrey Epstein, Case No. 2006 CF 09454 AXX, Fifteenth 
Judicial Circuit, Palm Beach County) (the "Florida Criminal Action"). 
As 
explained below, the parallel federal criminal action against him described in that 
motion (In re Grand Jury, No. FGJ 07-103(WPB), United States District Court for 
the Southern District of Florida) (the "Federal Criminal Action"), remains pending. 
On September 24, 2007, the United States Attorney's Office for the 
Southern District of Florida ("USAO"), represented by Assistant United States 
Attorney Ann Marie C. Villafana, Esq., and Mr. Epstein, entered into a deferred-
prosecution agreement ("Agreement"), which the parties agreed to keep 
confidential. Prior to entering into that Agreement, Ms. Villafana advised that she 
had already prepared a federal criminal indictment against Mr. Epstein in the 
Federal Criminal Action. 
Under the Agreement, beginning on the date Mr. Epstein began serving his 
sentence in the Florida Criminal Action, the USAO agreed to suspend its grand 
jury investigation in the Federal Criminal Action. The USAO, however, retains the

right to reactivate the grand jury and indict Mr. Epstein should he breach any part 
of the Agreement during its term, which runs for 33 months, beginning on the date 
Mr. Epstein began serving his sentence in the Florida Criminal Action. 
Accordingly, the Federal Criminal Action will remain pending against Mr. Epstein 
for 33 months from June 30, 2008. 
Mr. Epstein will provide the Court with a copy of the confidential 
Agreement for its in-camera inspection at the Court's request.

continued pendency of the Federal Criminal Action.

Dear Roy: 
In accordance with paragraph 13 of the Non-Prosecution Agreement, I am providing notice of possible 
compulsory process commanding the disclosure of the Agreement. As I'm sure you know, two of Mr. Epstein's 
victims have filed suit against the United States alleging that the government violated their rights as victims by 
not consulting them prior to entering into the Non-Prosecution Agreement. 
As part of their response to one of the government's filings, the victims asked the Court to order the production 
of the Non-Prosecution Agreement. The deadline for the government to respond is August I5'h and we intend to 
oppose the motion based upon the confidentiality provision. I have attached a copy of the victims' pleading for 
your review. 
In connection with this, we want to make certain that we are making consistent representations to the judiciary 
regarding the contents of the Agreement. I know that Jack Goldberger filed the Agreement under seal in the state 
court in accordance with the state judge's order. Can you provide us with a copy of what Jack filed, so that, if 
we are ordered by the federal court to disclose the agreement, it is exactly the same as what has been filed in the 
state court? 
Thank you again for your assistance.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA 
CASE NO.: 08-80736-CIV-MARRA/JOHNSON 
JANE DOE #1 AND JANE DOE #2, 
Petitioners, 
v. 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, 
Respondent. 
VICTIMS' RESPONSE TO GOVERNMENT'S "NOTICE TO COURT' REGARDING 
ABSENCE OF NEED FOR EVIDENTIARY HEARING" AND MOTION FOR 
PRODUCTION OF NON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENT AND OF REPORT OF 
INTERVIEW 
COME NOW the Petitioners, Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 (the "victims"), by and 
through their undersigned attorneys to file this Response to the Government's document styled as 
"Notice to Court Regarding Absence of Need for Evidentiary Hearing" as follows: 
INTRODUCTION 
At the conclusion of the oral argument on the victims' petition, victims Jane Doe #1 and 
Jane Doe #2 joined the Government in expressing to the Court a desire to work out a set of 
stipulated facts regarding this case. Towards that end, the Government sent a proposed set of 
stipulated facts to the victims' counsel (Exhibit 1 to this pleading) and, in turn, the victims' sent 
a responsive letter raising concerns about some of the Government's proposed stipulated facts 
and suggesting some additions and modifications (Exhibit 2 to this pleading). The victims also 
requested copies of two relevant documents from the Government: (1) the Non-Prosecution 
EFTA00013570

Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM 
Document 19

Page 2 of 16 
Agreement with defendant Epstein that is at the center of this litigation and (2) the FBI's report 
of interview concerning a meeting with Jane Doe #1. These requests were also made in several 
telephone conversations with the attorney for the Government. Remarkably, rather than respond 
to the victims' suggestions, the Government has now suddenly reversed course and filed a terse 
document claiming an "absence of a need" for an evidentiary hearing. If anything, however, the 
victims' discussions with the Government have made clear that the Court should not enter 
judgment for the Government but rather should enter immediate judgment for the victims that the 
Government violated their rights under the CVRA. The Court should then schedule a hearing to 
determine the proper remedy for the violation of the victims' rights. 
In particular, the Government now apparently admits that the Non-Prosecution 
Agreement it struck with Epstein in September 2007 contained an "express confidentiality 
provision." See Exhibit 1 to this pleading, Government's Proposed Stipulated Facts, at page 3, 
paragraph 6. Assuming that the Government honored its agreement with the defendant (a fact 
that the victims have proposed to stipulate to), the Government could not have "conferred" with 
the victims about the proposed arrangement over the next nine months because doing so would 
have violated its confidentiality obligations with the defendant. As a result, the Government 
plainly has not afforded the victims' their right to "confer" about the proposed arrangement under 
the Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA), 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(5). In addition, the Government 
effectively misled the victims that it had reached a Non-Prosecution Agreement with Epstein, 
plainly violating the victims' rights to be treated with "fairness" under the CVRA, 18 U.S.C. 
§3771(aX8). The Court should therefore find that the victims' rights have been violated. 
The Court should also order the Government to produce the Non-Prosecution Agreement 
EFTA00013571
--- PAGE 3 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM 
Document 19 
Entered on FLSD Docket 08/01/2008

to the victims. The victims are entitled to know what disposition has been made in their case. 
Moreover, that Agreement purportedly contains provisions pertaining to the civil liability of 
Epstein for crimes he has committed against Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2. Epstein obviously 
knows what those provisions are. The victims are entitled to see those provisions and the 
surrounding document as well. 
The Court should also order the Government to produce a report of interview with Jane 
Doe #1 from about October 26, 2007, during which the Government apparently claims that it 
discussed the plea arrangement with the victims. 
Finally, after these documents are produced to the victims and the Court enters judgment 
that the victims' rights have been violated, the Court should schedule a hearing to determine the 
appropriate remedy for the violations of the victims' rights. 
THE VICTIMS' PROFFERED FACTS 
The Government's latest submission takes the position that "after consideration" it is now 
unnecessary to hold an evidentiary hearing. The Government apparently believes that the Court 
could rule in its favor based on just two submitted undisputed facts. In taking this position, the 
Government apparently believes that there are no set of facts that could sustain judgment for the 
victims. To the contrary, however, the available facts require judgment for the victims that their 
rights under the CVRA have been violated. 
Having attempted to confer with the Government about the facts in this case, counsel for 
the victims respectfully submit the following — and more complete -- set of facts that, on 
information and belief, they could establish if given the opportunity to do so: 
In 2006, at the request of the Palm Beach Police Department, the Federal Bureau of 
EFTA00013572

Investigation opened an investigation into allegations that Jeffrey Epstein had used facilities of 
interstate commerce to induce young girls between the ages of thirteen and seventeen to engage 
in prostitution (among other offenses). The case was presented to the United States Attorney's 
Office for the Southern District of Florida, which accepted the case for investigation. Jane Doe 
#1 and Jane Doe #2 were victims of sex crimes committed by Epstein while they were minors. 
The U.S. Attorney's Office's investigation soon revealed that Epstein had committed 
federal sex crimes against Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2. This made Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe 
#2 "victims" protected by the Crime Victim's Rights Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3771. Accordingly, the 
U.S. Attorney's Office arranged to have victim notification letters sent to Jane Doe #1 and Jane 
Doe #2. For example, on about June 7, 2007, Assistant U.S. Attorney ant 
a 
letter to Jane Doe #1 that began: "Pursuant to the [CVRA), as a victim and/or witness of a federal 
offense, you have a number of rights." The letter then listed the various rights of victims under 
the CVRA. The U.S. Attorney's Office would not have sent such a letter to Jane Doe #1 if it did 
not believe that she was a victim and was protected by the CVRA. 
By mid-2007, the U.S. Attorney's Office had ample information to file an indictment 
against Epstein charging multiple federal sex offenses. It elected not to file an indictment but 
instead to engage in pre-indictment plea discussions with Epstein. 
In September 2007, Epstein and the U.S. Attorney's Office reached an agreement 
blocking any federal prosecution of the federal offenses he had committed. 
This Non-
Prosecution Agreement barred federal charges for Epstein's sex offenses in favor of prosecution 
by Florida, so long as several preconditions were met. Those included a conviction on a state 
sex offense that reflected that the victims were minors at the time the crimes occurred and that

would require sex offender registration. 
While the Agreement barred federal criminal 
prosecution, it envisioned that the victims would pursue a civil rights action against Epstein for 
his sexual offenses against them. Most important for present purposes, the Agreement contained 
an express confidentiality provision, which prevented the Government from disclosing the terms 
of the Agreement to the victims or others before it was consummated. The Agreement was 
subsequently modified in October and December 2007. The Agreement has several addenda that 
are relevant to the Agreement. (To date, although requested to do so, the Government has 
refused to provide to the victims the final Non-Prosecution Agreement or any of its earlier 
versions.) Through his attorneys, Epstein was aware of the confidentiality provision and of the 
fact that it would block the Government from conferring with the victims about the plea 
arrangement. 
On about October 26, 2007, FBI Special Agents 
and NM 
UM 
met in person with Jane Doe #1 at a restaurant. The Special Agents explained that there 
had been discussions with Epstein about a possible resolution of the charges against him. 
Consistent with the express confidentiality provision in the Non-Prosecution Agreement, the 
Special Agents did not disclose that the arrangement would bar any federal prosecution of 
Epstein. Nor did the Agents disclose that the Non-Prosecution Agreement had been finalized. 
Jane Doe #1's reasonable perception of the meeting was that only the State part of the Epstein 
investigation had been resolved, and that the federal investigation would continue, possibly 
leading to a federal prosecution. (While the Government has a report of interview regarding this 
meeting with the victim that could confirm the victims' understanding of the facts, the 
Government has refused Jane Doe #1's request to see the report.)

Following the signing of the Non-Prosecution Agreement and the modifications thereto 
by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida, Epstein received an unusual 
benefit that the Government does not ordinarily provide to other criminal defendants: his 
performance was delayed while he was given an opportunity to seek higher level review within 
the Department of Justice in Washington, D.C. 
On around January 10, 2008, Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 received letters from the FBI 
advising them that "[t]his case is currently under investigation. This can be a lengthy process 
and we request you continued patience while we conduct a thorough investigation." The FBI 
sent these letters, under the direction of the U.S. Attorney's Office, because it believed that the 
CVRA applied to Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2. The FBI did not notify Jane Doe #1 or Jane 
Doe #2 that the Non-Prosecution Agreement had been concluded four months earlier. Jane Doe 
#1 and Jane Doe #2 reasonably understood that a federal criminal investigation of Epstein was 
on-going and that federal criminal charges were possibility. At the time, Jane Doe #1 and Jane 
Doe #2 believed that criminal prosecution of Epstein was extremely important. They also 
desired to be consulted by the FBI and/or other representatives of the federal government about 
the prosecution of Epstein. In light of the letters that they had received around January 10 
(among other things), they reasonably believed that they would be contacted before the federal 
government reached any final resolution of that investigation. 
In the spring 2008, Jane Doe #1 contacted the FBI because Epstein's counsel was 
attempting to take her deposition and private investigators were harassing her. Assistant U.S. 
Attorney OPIMMINIMMINIIR secured pro bono counsel to represent Jane Doe #1 and several other 
identified victims in connection with the criminal investigation. Pro bono counsel was able to

assist Jane Doe #1 in avoiding the improper deposition. AUSA Villafana secured pro bono 
counsel by contacting Meg Garvin, Esq. of the National Crime Victims' Law Institute in 
Portland, Oregon, which is based in the Lewis & Clark College of Law. During the call, Ms. 
Garvin was not advised about the Non-Prosecution Agreement. 
In mid-June 2008, Mr. Edwards contacted Assistant U.S. Attorney Ito 
inform her 
that he represented Jane Doe #1 and, later, Jane Doe #2. Mr. Edwards asked to meet to provide 
information about the federal crimes committed by Epstein, hoping to secure a significant federal 
indictment against Epstein. AUSA MM. and Mr. Edwards discussed the possibility of federal 
charges being filed. At the end of the call, AUSA 
asked Mr. Edwards to send any 
information that he wanted considered by the U.S. Attorney's Office in determining whether to 
file federal charges. Because of the confidentiality provision in the Non-Prosecution Agreement, 
Mr. Edwards was not informed of the Agreement's existence. 
Mr. Edwards was also not 
informed that any resolution of the criminal matter was imminent. 
On July 3, 2008, Mr. Edwards sent to AUSA VIM'S a letter, a true and correct copy of 
which is attached as Exhibit 3. In the letter, Mr. Edwards indicated his desire that federal 
charges be filed against defendant Epstein. In particular, he wrote on behalf of his clients: "We 
urge the Attorney General and our United States Attorney to consider the fundamental import of 
the vigorous enforcement of our Federal laws. We urge you to move forward with the traditional 
indictments and criminal prosecution commensurate with the crimes Mr. Epstein has committed, 
and we further urge you to take the steps necessary to protect our children from this very 
dangerous sexual predator." When Mr. Edwards wrote this letter, he still had not been made 
aware that a Non-Prosecution Agreement had been reached with Epstein.

On about July 3, 2008, Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 learned, through telephones 
conversations had between Mr. Edwards and AUSA 
that the U.S. Attorney's Office 
and Epstein might be in the process of finalizing some sort of plea arrangement. Accordingly, 
they filed an emergency motion seeking to protect their rights under the CVRA, including in 
particular their right to confer about the proposed plea arrangement. 
Mr. Edwards — and thus his clients -- first learned of the Non-Prosecution Agreement on 
or after July 9, 2008, when the Government filed its responsive pleading to Jane Doe's 
emergency petition. That pleading was the first public mention of the non-prosecution agreement 
and the first disclosure to Mr. Edwards and his clients. Epstein, through his attorneys, knew that 
the victims had not been informed about the plea arrangement. 
On July 9, 2008, AUSA 
sent a victim notification to Jane Doe #1 via her 
attorney, Mr. Edwards, which is attached as Exhibit 6 to the 1
11111 Declaration. That 
notification contains a written explanation of some of the terms of the Non-Prosecution 
Agreement between Epstein and the U.S. Attorney's Office. A full copy of the terms was not 
provided. This was the first time that Jane Doe #1 was told that the arrangement blocked any 
possibility of federal criminal charges being filed against Epstein. A notification was not 
provided to Jane Doe #2 because the agreement limited Epstein's liability to victims whom the 
United States was prepared to name in an indictment. 
On July I I, 2008, the Court held a hearing on the victims' emergency motion. During the 
hearing, the Government discussed in open court various provisions of the Non-Prosecution 
Agreement. At the conclusion of the hearing, victims' counsel and the Government agreed to

confer in an effort to determine the undisputed facts of the fact. The Court took the motion under 
advisement. 
On July 16, 2008, the Government sent to Mr. Edwards a proposed set of undisputed 
facts, which is attached to this pleading as Exhibit 1. 
On July 17, 2008, Mr. Edwards sent a response to the Government, which is attached to 
this pleading as Exhibit 2. The response made various suggestions to the proposed undisputed 
facts. The response also requested a copy of the Non-Prosecution Agreement and the Report of 
Interview with Jane Doe #1. 
On July 29, 2008, rather than attempt to work with victims' counsel to draft a set of 
undisputed facts, the Government filed its "Notice to Court Regarding Absence of Need for 
Evidentiary Hearing." 
At all times material to this statement of facts, it would have been easily practical and 
feasible for the Federal Government to inform Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 of the details of any 
proposed plea agreement with Epstein, including in particular the details of the Non-Prosecution 
Agreement. The reason that AUSA yin and the FBI agents acting with her did not provide 
this information to Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 was because of the express confidentiality 
provision that had been entered into by the Federal Government and Epstein. This provision 
was requested by Epstein. The Government was under no obligation to enter into such an 
arrangement and would have been statutorily forbidden from entering into such an arrangement 
by the CVRA's requirement that it "confer" with the victims about any disposition of their cases.

THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO CONFER WITH THE VICTIMS 
REGARDING THE UNDISPUTED FACTS OF THE CASE 
The Government should be directed to confer with the victims about the facts in this case, 
rather than allowed to obscure the facts with its proposed "notice" that an evidentiary hearing is 
unnecessary. The reason that the Government abruptly terminated discussions about the facts 
with the victims seem obvious: The facts, if revealed, would plainly demonstrate that the victims 
did not receive their right under the CVRA to confer with the Government and to be treated 
fairly. The victims will not repeat all of their arguments from their earlier pleadings but would 
simply highlight for the Court the point that this case already reeks of favored treatment for a 
billionaire sex offender who has substantial influence. Regardless of how the Court proceeds, it 
should at least do so on the basis of fully developed factual record so that the victims and the 
public can be assured that justice has been done. 
If anything, the facts in this case now call for immediate judgment in favor of the victims. 
Based on the Government's proposed stipulated facts (Exhibit 1 to this pleading), it is now 
obvious that the Government could not have fulfilled its statutory obligations to confer with the 
victims. As now admitted by the Government, in September 2007, it had entered into a Non-
Prosecution Agreement with Epstein containing what it describes as "an express confidentiality 
provision." While the Government has refused to disclose the text of this provision (or, indeed, 
the Non-Prosecution Agreement itself), it is apparent that the Government could not have 
conferred with the victims about the Agreement while abiding by the confidentiality provision. 
Likewise it is now apparent that the Government has not fulfilled its statutory obligation 
to treat the victims with fairness. The Government reached the Non-Prosecution Agreement with 
EFTA00013579
--- PAGE 11 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM 
Document 19

Page 11 of 16 
Epstein in September 2007, yet affirmatively concealed that Agreement from the victims through 
a series of misleading statements and representations over the next nine months. For example, 
on around January 10, 2008, Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 received letters from the FBI advising 
them that "Mills case is currently under investigation. This can be a lengthy process and we 
request your continued patience while we conduct a thorough investigation." As the Government 
well knew, however, a Non-Prosecution Agreement had already been reached with Epstein at that 
time — a fact not disclosed in the letter. 
The victims therefore request judgment in their favor that their rights under the CVRA 
have been violated. 
In the alternative, the victims request that the Court direct that the 
Government confer in good faith with the victims to attempt to reach a set of stipulated facts that 
might form the basis for a final ruling in this case. As part of this conference, the victims request 
that the Government indicate which (if any) of the proposed facts set forth above it disputes. 
THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO PRODUCE 
THE NON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENT 
Remarkably, the Government has yet to disclose to the victims the very Non-Prosecution 
Agreement that lies at the heart of this case. This failure becomes even more curious when 
assessed against the Government's proposed stipulation of facts, which included the proposed 
fact that the victims had been told about the "full terms" of the Agreement. The proposed 
stipulated facts that the Government sent to the victims included this proposed stipulation: 
On July 9, 2008, AUSA as 
sent a victim notification to Jane Doe #1 via her 
attorney, Bradley Edwards, which is attached as Exhibit 6 to the 
Declaration. That notification contains a written explanation of the full terms of 
the agreement between Epstein and the U.S. Attorney's Office. 
Contrary to its own proposed stipulation, the Government has never disclosed to the victims the 
EFTA00013580
--- PAGE 12 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM 
Document 19 
Entered on FLSD Docket 08/01/2008 
Page 12 of 16 
"full terms" of its Non-Prosecution Agreement with Epstein. To protect the victims' right to be 
treated with fairness, 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(8), it should be required to do so now. 
Congress' main concern in passing the CVRA was that crime victims were "treated as 
non-participants in a critical event in their lives. They were kept in the dark by prosecutors too 
busy to care enough ... and by a court system that simply did not have a place for them." 150 
CONG. REC. 54262 (Apr. 22, 2004) (statement of Sen. Feinstein). To remedy this problem, 
Congress gave victims "the simple right to know what is going on, to participate in the process 
where the information that victims and their families can provide may be material and relevant ... 
." Id. To date, Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 do not know what has happened to their case, 
because they have not been told how it has been resolved. Of course, no possible harm to the 
Government can come from the release of the Agreement, as this criminal matter is now 
concluded — at least from the Government's perspective. 
Production of the Non-Prosecution Agreement is also warranted because it has provisions 
in it that are designed to benefit Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2. As described by the Government, 
the Agreement contains provisions in it that preclude Epstein from contesting civil liability for 
the sex offenses committed against a number of the victims, including Jane Doe # I. Obviously, 
Jane Doe #1 cannot take advantage of this provision if her attorneys are not able to review it. 
Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 intend to file civil suits against Epstein within the next few days. 
Epstein knows what is in the Non-Prosecution Agreement that may be helpful to him. Jane Doe 
# I and Jane Doe #2 are entitled to see the Agreement for items that may be helpful to them. 
Finally, Epstein is apparently taking advantage of provisions in the Non-Prosecution 
Agreement to stall civil suits against him. For example, in Jane Doe v. Epstein et at, No. 08-
EFTA00013581
--- PAGE 13 ---

Document 19

Page 13 of 16 
80804-MARRA/JOHNSON (S.D. Fla. 2008), on July 25, 2008, Epstein filed a motion for a stay. 
That motion claims that the civil action is "a counterpart to a pending federal criminal action." 
The basis for that claim, so far as Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 can tell, is the federal Non-
Prosecution Agreement. Epstein should not be permitted to use provisions in the Agreement to 
his advantage in private litigation without disclosing those provisions to the parties he is 
opposing. Indeed, as a simple matter of fairness to the victims, see 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(5) 
(victims right to "fairness"), the provisions should be disclosed. 
In sum, the Court should direct the Government to reveal to the victims what it has done 
to resolve the case by ordering production of the full Non-Prosecution Agreement and any 
accompanying addenda to the agreement. 
THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO PRODUCE THE REPORT OF 
INTERVIEW WITH JANE DOE #1 
The Government apparently has a report of interview indicating that two named FBI 
agents met with Jane Doe #1 on about October 26, 2007. The Government, however, has 
declined to produce it. 
The Government should be directed to produce this information to Jane Doe #1. Of 
course, a criminal defendant would be entitled to such a report. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(1)(A) 
& (B). As an innocent victim in this matter, Jane Doe #1 should be treated with at least the same 
consideration. See 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(8) (victim's right to "be treated with fairness"). Jane 
Doe #1 requested this report in her letter regarding the proposed stipulated facts (see Exhibit 2 to 
this filing), a request that the Government has simply ignored.

AFTER ENTERING JUDGMENT FOR THE VICTIMS' ON THE VIOLATION OF THEIR 
RIGHTS, THE COURT SHOULD SCHEDULE A HEARING ON THE APPROPRIATE 
REMEDY 
For the reasons just explained, the Court should enter judgment for Jane Doe #1 and Jane 
Doe #2 on the violations of their rights under the CVRA and order the Government to produce 
the Non-Prosecution Agreement and the report of interview with Jane Doe #1. After doing that, 
the question then arises as to what is the proper remedy for the violations of victims' rights. 
To be clear, at this time, the victims seek two things: (1) a judicial declaration that the 
Government violated their rights under the CVRA and an apology from the Government; and (2) 
a hearing to discuss the appropriate remedy under the circumstances. At the same time, the 
victims are not asking to have any provision in the Non-Prosecution Agreement establishing 
liability in a civil suit to be vacated or declared invalid. 
Because the possible connection 
between these two things raises complex legal issues, the victims respectfully request that the 
Court order a hearing at which the appropriate remedy can be discussed. The victims also need 
to review the full text of the Non-Prosecution Agreement and any accompanying addenda to 
make an appropriate determination about the remedy that they wish to pursue. 
CONCLUSION 
The Court should find that the Government violated Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2's 
rights under the CVRA to confer and to be treated with fairness during the negotiation and 
consummation of the Non-Prosecution Agreement. In the alternative, the Court should direct the 
Government to confer with the victims regarding what facts are undisputed in this matter and, 
should material facts actually be disputed, hold an evidentiary hearing regarding those facts. So 
that the victims can discuss these matters with the Government, the Court should order the

Government to provide to the victims the full Non-Prosecution Agreement (and accompanying 
addenda) that is central to this litigation as well as a report of interview with Jane Doe #1 from 
about October 26, 2007. The Court should then hold a hearing on the proper remedy for the 
violations of the victims' rights.

Re: 
Jeffrey Epstein 
Dear Jay and Roy: 
Thank you for your letter of August 22nd. I write to follow up on some of the points 
that you raised. 
The list of thirty-two victims that was provided to Mr. Goldberger via certified mail 
on July 10, 2008 is the final list. As I mentioned, copies of the notification letters to each 
victim will be carbon-copied to an attorney for Mr. Epstein and Mr. Josefsberg. I asked you 
to advise me whether Mr. Goldberger should continue to be listed as the contact person for 
the civil litigation in the amended victim notification letters and whether he should receive 
the carbon copies of those letters as they are sent. 
I also asked you to provide me with written confirmation of your agreement to pay Mr. 
Josefsberg's fees. Please provide that confirmation to Mr. Josefsberg so that he can begin 
his representation, and provide me with a copy for my file. 
I have conferred with the lead AUSA in the case of Jane Doe 1 and 2 v. United States,

and he agrees that, based upon the discussion with Judge Marra during the hearing on the 
plaintiffs' motion, a notification of the judge's ruling is required. I will, however, change 
the language slightly to direct the victims to discuss the matter with Mr. Josefsberg. 
With regard to your concerns with my "open-ended description of Mr. Epstein's 
responsibilities regarding civil restitution," I agree that the resolution of civil damages claims 
is as stated in paragraphs 7 and 8 of the Agreement and Addendum. That is why the 
language in the notification is taken verbatim from paragraphs 7, 8, and 7C of the Agreement 
and Addendum, except that the victim's name is used in place of "identified individual." As 
I mentioned in my earlier letter, ifyou have any proposed substantive changes, please provide 
them to me. 
Mr. Goldberger and Mr. Tein explicitly approved the language in my earlier victim 
notification letter, even though they apparently were taking the position that the December 
19, 2007 letter was not part of the Agreement, so that misinformation was provided to the 
victims with the approval of Mr. Epstein's attorneys. 
With regard to your sixth and seventh points. I reiterate that it is the Office's position 
that the Agreement and Addendum speak for themselves. Let me also reiterate that, while 
the Office does not intend to involve itself in any civil negotiations or litigation, if it comes 
to our attention that Mr. Epstein has breached the terms of the Agreement, the Office intends 
to enforce its right pursuant to the Agreement. 
I would appreciate a prompt response to the question regarding which of Mr. Epstein's 
attorneys should be named in and receive copies of the notification letters, as well as 
documentation of your commitment to paying Mr. Josefsberg's fees so that I may begin 
distributing the revised victim notifications on Wednesday morning.

Hi everyone -- Can you please review and comment on the attached? I wanted to give you one more piece of info that will 
blow your minds. 
I finally heard back from Epstein's work release supervisor. She had told 
that even though Epstein's paperwork 
shows a late September release date (with credit for gain time), he will actually be eligible for release on July 23rd. I called 
to ask why and this is the answer. The September date just takes into account statutorily mandated gain time. For each 
week that he is on work release, he gets an additional two days off of his sentence. Yes, not only does Mr. Epstein get to 
spend 12 hours each day lounging in his high-rise office building, but he also gets to shorten his sentence by two months in 
doing so! 
So, please let me know what you think. I would like to send it out asap. Thanks.

Re: 
Proposed Stipulated Facts for In Re Jane Doe 
Dear Ms. 
Thank you for your recent proposed stipulation of facts in this case. I believe that we 
have considerable common ground. At the same time, however, it appears to me that a few areas 
of potential disagreement are arising. In view of that, and to avoid any misunderstandings, I 
thought it might be useful to send a short letter outlining several requests and issues for 
resolution before I send you back my proposed stipulated facts. 
1. 
I am working with two other attorneys on this case — Jay Howell in Jacksonville, 
Florida, and Professor Paul Cassell in Salt Lake City, Utah. Because they were not in court for 
the hearing last Friday, they will need to review a transcript of the hearing before our legal team 
can agree to any stipulated facts. 1 have requested a transcript, but the preparation of it will 
apparently take several weeks. Do you have any way of expediting the preparation of the 
transcript by requesting it yourself? Also, as you know, my clients are indigent. As part of the 
Government's responsibility to use its "best efforts to see that crime victims are . 
accorded() 
the rights" in the CVRA, 18 U.S.C. § 3771(c)(1), I was wondering whether the Government 
would be willing to pay for the transcript. 
2. 
Your proposed stipulation indicates that in September 2007 the U.S. Attorney's 
Office reached an agreement with Epstein to resolve the case, which was then modified in 
October and December of that year. While this seems plausible, to stipulate to the facts, I would 
obviously need to see copies of those three agreements. Moreover, because the circumstances 
surrounding the initial agreement and its later modification are now the subject of litigation, my 
client is entitled to see them. See 18 U.S.C. § 3771(aX8) (victim's right to "be treated with 
fairness"). In addition, your proposed stipulation states that: "On July 9, 2008, AUSA 
sent a victim notification to Jane Doe #1 via her attorney, Bradley Edwards, which is attached as 
Exhibit 6 to the 
Declaration. That notification contains a written explanation of the full 
terms of the agreement between Epstein and the U.S. Attorney's Office." I am puzzled by this 
proposed stipulation, as your July 9 letter explicitly noted that it was covering only some of the 
provisions in the agreement. Perhaps the fact that I have not yet received the agreement is all 
just an oversight on your part, and you had intended to give me the "full terms" of the plea 
agreement that was ultimately reached. In any event, the simplest way to proceed at this point is 
for the plea agreement — and the earlier versions -- to be provided to me so that I can review

them with my clients. Of course, no possible harm to the Government can come from the release 
of the documents, as this criminal matter is now concluded — at least from the Government's 
perspective. 
3. 
I am wondering about your position on the confidentiality provision in the 
agreement. As I understand things from your proposed stipulation, in September 2007 you 
"reached" an agreement with Epstein's attorneys that "contained an express confidentiality 
provision." Are you taking the position that this "express" provision barred disclosure of the 
substance of the agreement to my clients? And, if so, would you stipulate that the FBI agents 
and your office complied with the provision up through Ante 30 when, I assume, the confidential 
provision expired as Epstein entered his guilty plea in open court? 
4. 
Your proposed stipulation indicates: 
On October 26, 2007, Special Agents 
and 
met in person with Jane Doe #1. 111.1.1s 
explained that the 
investigation had been resolved, that Epstein would plead guilty to state charges, 
he would be required to register as a sex offender for life, and he had made certain 
concessions related to the payment of damages to the victims, including Jane Doe 
#1. 
During this meeting, Jane Doe #1 did not raise any objections to the 
resolution of the matter. 
From the drafting of this proposed stipulation, it appears that you may be working from a Report 
of Interview with my client (i.e., an FBI 302). My client has a differing recollection of some 
aspects of that meeting. Of course, she did not take notes of the meeting. Therefore, I ask that 
you provide me (the relevant parts of) any report of this meeting as well as reports of any other 
meetings relevant to the matters at hand. 
I believe that my client is entitled to a copy of (the relevant parts of) the reports of 
interviews with her. Of course, a criminal defendant would be entitled to such documents. See 
Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(aX1)(A) & (B). As an innocent victim in this matter, my client should be 
treated with at least the same consideration. See 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(8) (victim's right to "be 
treated with fairness"). 
5. 
I am hoping that the Special Agents' and my client's recollections about one point 
of the October 26th meeting coincides: that she was never told that the agreement blocked all 
federal prosecution for the crimes at hand. Is a stipulation on that point agreeable?

6. 
You mention your assistance in securing pro bono counsel for Jane Doe #1 to help 
prevent harassment. I trust that you would be willing to stipulate that you did not mention the 
federal non-prosecution agreement to this counsel and that you did not mention that a plea 
agreement had already been reached. Professor Cassell has spoken to Meg Garvin, Esq., at the 
National Crime Victims' Law Institute, and that is her recollection of the events. 
7. 
I think that your proposed stipulation regarding my contact with the office is 
somewhat abbreviated. I wonder what you would think about the following: 
In mid-June 2008, Mr. Edwards contacted AUSA MI 
to inform her 
that he represented Jane Doe #1 and, later, Jane Doe #2. Mr. Edwards asked to 
meet to provide information about the federal crimes committed by Epstein, 
!leg
to secure a significant federal indictment against Epstein. 
AUSA 
and Mr. Edwards discus 
sibility of federal charges being 
filed. At the end of the call, AUSA 
asked Mr. Edwards to send any 
information that he wanted considered by the U.S. Attorney's Office in 
determining whether to file federal charges. 
Because of the confidentiality 
provision that existed in the plea agreement, Mr. Edwards was not informed that, 
in September 2007, the U.S. Attorney's Office had reached an agreement not to 
file federal charges. Mr. Edwards was also not informed that any resolution of the 
criminal matter was imminent. 
On July 3, 2008, Mr. Edwards sent to AUSA 
a letter, a true and 
correct copy of which is attached. In the letter, Mr. Edwards indicated his desire 
that federal charges be filed against defendant Epstein. In particular, he wrote on 
behalf of his clients: "We urge the Attorney General and our United States 
Attorney to consider the fundamental import of the vigorous enforcement of our 
Federal laws. We urge you to move forward with the traditional indictments and 
criminal prosecution commensurate with the crimes Mr. Epstein has committed, 
and we further urge you to take the steps necessary to protect our children from 
this very dangerous sexual predator." When Mr. Edwards wrote this letter, he 
was still unaware that a non-prosecution agreement had been reached with 
Epstein. Mr. Edwards first learned of this fact on or after July 9, 2008, when the 
Government filed its responsive pleading to Jane Doe's emergency petition. That 
pleading was the first public mention of the non-prosecution agreement and the 
first disclosure to Mr. Edwards and his clients. 
8. 
I trust that you will agree that the Government had probable cause to file a 
multiple count federal indictment against Epstein, including an indictment charging crimes

against Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2. In asking for this stipulation, I realize that you have taken 
the position that you would not have filed an indictment involving Jane Doe #2, presumably 
because you thought that you could not carry the Government's burden of proof beyond a 
reasonable doubt. At the same time, though, I trust you will concede that the evidence in that 
case was strong enough to pass the probable cause standard. 
9. 
Finally, in light of the fact that you have been sending letters to Jane Doe #2, 
which was obviously done because you believed her to be a `victim" in this case, and since she 
has been added in this matter as a victim, we would like some assurances that she will be 
protected, as the other victims have been, in your agreement with Mr. Epstein. 
Thank you very much for considering these issues and concerns. I look forward to 
working with you to reach a stipulation that covers as much common ground as possible in this 
case. If you think that further discussions might be helpful, I would like to try and set up a 
conference call with you and my co-counsel to discuss these issues further. 
Sincerely,

Dear Ms. 
As you are aware, we represent several of the young girls that were victimized 
and abused by Jeffrey Epstein. While we are aware of his recent guilty plea and 
conviction in his State Court case, the sentence imposed in that case is grossly inadequate 
for a sexual predator of this magnitude. The information and evidence that has come to 
our attention in this matter leads to a grave concern that justice will not be served in this 
cause if Mr. Epstein is not aggressively prosecuted and appropriately punished. Based on 
our investigation and knowledge of this case, it is apparent that he has sexually abused 
more than 100 underage girls, and the evidence against him is overwhelmingly strong. 
As former Assistant State Attorneys with seven years' prosecution experience, we 
believe that the evidence against Mr. Epstein is both credible and deep and that he may 
be the most dangerous sexual predator of children that our country has ever seen. The 
evidence suggests that for at least 4 years he was sexually abusing as many as three to 
four girls a day. It is inevitable that if he is not confined to prison, he will continue to 
manipulate and sexually abuse children and destroy more lives. He is a sexual addict that 
focused all of his free time on sexually abusing children, and he uses his extraordinary 
wealth and power to lure in poor, underprivileged little girls and then also uses his wealth 
to shield himself from prosecution and liability. We are very concerned for the health 
and welfare of the girls he has already victimized, and concerned that if justice is not 
properly served now and he is not imprisoned for a very long time, he will get a free pass 
to sexually abuse children in the future. Future abuse and victimization is obvious to 
anyone who really reviews the evidence in this case, and future sexual abuse of minors is 
inevitable unless he is prosecuted, tried and appropriately sentenced. Money and power 
should not allow a man to make his own laws, and he has clearly received preferential 
treatment at every step up to this point. If he were a man of average wealth or the abused 
girls were from middle or upper class families, then this man would spend the rest of his 
life in prison. In a country of true, blind justice, those distinctions are irrelevant, and we 
really hope he does not prove the point that a man can commit heinous crimes against 
children and buy his way out of it. 
If the Department of Justice's recent commitment to the protection of our children 
from child molesters is to be more than rhetoric, then this is the time and the case where 
the Department must step forward. We urge the Attorney General and our United States

Dear 
Sony I didn't get back to you sooner but I've been incredibly busy since I left paradise in Miami Beach. Just 
argued an appeal in NY and debated the Mideast at Georgetown. I greatly appreciate your willingness to call the 
sheriff and advise him that your office would take no position on how he handled Epstein's sentence as long as 
he didn't get special treatment, but let's put any call off for a while. . Thanks.

If the United States elects to assign this responsibility to an independent third-party, the United States retains the

The United States will assign to an independent third-party, who shall be appointed subject to the good faith approval of Epstein's

settlement for any claimant and the further role of advising such potential claimants of their alternative right to retain their own counsel 
for the purposes of separate litigation. 
I made it "will assign" because I understood that you didn't actually want to pick the lawyer and that you wanted judge davis, or 
someone like him, to select the lawyer. 
The other edits should be clear to you in terms of what I am trying to safeguard, but I would be happy to discuss with you later this pm.

Jay, 
Pursuant to our conversation. Thanks, 
IN RE: 
INVESTIGATION OF 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN 
ADDENDUM TO THE NON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENT 
IT APPEARING that the parties seek to clarify certain provisions of page 4, paragraph 7 of the Non-Prosecution 
Agreement (hereinafter "paragraph 7"), that agreement is modified as follows: 
1. 
The United States has the right to assign to an independent third-party, the responsibility for consulting 
with and, subject to the good faith approval of Epstein's counsel, selecting the attorney representative for the 
victims. If the United States elects to assign this responsibility to an independent third-party, the United States 
retains the right to request that the independent third-party also consult with the United States. 
2. 
Pursuant to paragraph 7, Epstein has agreed to pay the fees of the attorney representative. This provision, 
however, shall not obligate Epstein to pay the fees and costs of contested litigation filed against him. Thus, if 
after consideration of potential settlements, the attorney representative elects to file a contested lawsuit pursuant 
to 18 U.S.C. s 2255 or elects to pursue any other contested remedy, the paragraph 7 obligation to pay the costs of 
the attorney representative, as opposed to any statutory or other obligations to pay reasonable attorneys fees and 
costs such as those contained in s 2255 to bear the costs of the attorney representative, shall cease. 
EFTA00013613

By signing this Addendum, Epstein asserts and certifies that the above has been read and 
explained to him. Epstein hereby states that he understands the clarifications to the Non-
Prosecution Agreement and agrees to comply with them.

The below is exactly the same as yours, except for deletion of "Other than the joint written submission, neither the United 
States nor Epstein's counsel shall communicate with the independent third party nor shall the United States communicate 
with the attorney representative selected by him" in your 1(a). 
1. The United States has the right to assign to an independent third-party the responsibility for consulting with and, subject 
to the good faith approval of Epstein's counsel, selecting the attorney representative for the individuals identified under the 
Agreement. If the United States elects to assign this responsibility to an independent third-party, both the United States 
and Epstein retain the right to make good faith objections to the attorney representative suggested by the independent 
third-party prior to the final designation of the attorney representative. 
2. The parties will jointly prepare a short written submission to the independent third-party regarding the role of the 
attorney representative and regarding Epstein's Agreement to pay such attorney representative his or her regular 
customary hourly rate for representing such victims subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, infra. 
3. Pursuant to additional paragraph 1, Epstein has agreed to pay the fees of the attorney representative selected by the 
independent third party. This provision, however, shall not obligate Epstein to pay the fees and costs of contested litigation 
filed against him. Thus, if after consideration of potential settlements, an attorney representative elects to file a contested

Written Submission 
The United States and Jeffrey E. Epstein have 
executed an Agreement one section of which obligates 
Epstein not to contest jurisdiction nor liability as to 
any of 40 potential complainants whose identities are 
on a list compiled by the United States to the extent 
that such persons have a cause of action against 
Epstein under 18 USC 2255 based on a good faith showing 
of injury under that statute and who negotiate an 
agreed settlement for damages pursuant to that statute 
with Epstein's counsel. The attorney representative 
selected by the independent third party shall each be 
paid his or her normal hourly fee to discharge his or 
her functions under this paragraph. The independent 
third party's role will be to select an attorney 
representative for the group of 40 potential 
complainants as detailed above. The attorney 
representative's role will be to consult with the 
complainants and determine whether each or any of them 
intend to negotiate a settlement with Epstein and waive 
any other state or federal cause of action against him 
(and if so, to facilitate such a settlement), or 
whether each or any of them intend, instead, to 
litigate a cause of action.

FYI — The story of the lawsuit filed by the girl in New York has made the national news (it was on Fox News several 
times today and it is on ABC News' website). I think that may be the real reason for the delay in the change of plea. Epstein's 
group is concerned that the guilty plea will be used against him in civil suits and they want to knock that lawsuit out before the 
guilty plea to deter others. One of the newspapers also reported that Epstein's camp had planted the false stories about girls 
who "just sat in his kitchen" filing suit in an attempt to discredit the girls.

Jay, 
The Judge Davis issue is a non-starter. We've beaten that horse to death. Regarding your contention that "the attorney 
representative be told clearly that Mr. Epstein has agreed to pay the lawyer's hourly rate only for the time he or she spends 
working to effectuate settlements for the identified women," Alex and I agree that paragraph 7C is sufficient, Regarding the 
other points, we have made the following concessions: 
1. 
Regarding the language concerning a lawyer whose firm is sizeable enough to litigate multiple trials 
simultaneously, I have removed paragraph 4 on page 3 of the letter. 
2. 
Regarding the 150k statutory limit language, I have included a footnote which should satisfy your concern. 
3. 
Regarding language there may be discovery to test the claims of alleged "victims", please see new paragraph 
on page 3 which now states as criteria that the firm should have "Experience litigating against large law firms and high 
profile attorneys who may test the veracity of the victims' claims." 
I have attached the Addendum and the revised letter to Judge Davis. Jay, this needs to be concluded. Alex and I believe 
that this is as far as we can go. Therefore, please advise me whether we have a deal no later than COB tomorrow, 
Tuesday, October 23, 2007. Thanks,

I have reviewed your proposed language and wanted to raise a few areas of concern. 
First, I am not sure why we are not just asking Judge Davis to represent these women. If he is available, that would save 
us a whole additional layer of process. I had thought that was initially the idea. I am not sure why you seem to be moving 
in another direction. 
I also cannot understand why the draft affirmatively requests that J Davis select a lawyer whose firm is sizeable enough to 
litigate multiple trials simultaneously. That seems to be directly at odds with the purpose of the agreement, which is to 
facilitate out of court settlements. Indeed, to the extent any woman were to elect to bring an action against Mr. Epstein, 
she would not only be free to select any lawyer of her choice, but would be restricted from using the lawyer representative 
in this capacity due to the conflicts of interests that would cause. This part of your proposed language is of signficiant 
concern to me. 
Your letter also indicates the 150k statutory limit without reference to the pre-existing 50G limit. To be sure, any of the 
women are free to seek whatever settlement they want, but given the question that exists about the statutory amount, the 
letter should not state definitely that it will be 150k. 
In addition, you have omitted a few important items from your proposal. Given that Judge Davis or any other potential 
attorney representative should understand the scope of the work, the language should make clear that there may be 
discovery to test the claims of alleged "victims." 
Finally, I think it is important that the attorney representative be told clearly that Mr. Epstein has agreed to pay the lawyer's 
hourly rate only for the time he or she spends working to effectuate settlements for the identified women.

The Hon. Edward B. Davis (Ret.) 
Akerman Senterfitt 
One Southeast Third Avenue, 25th Floor 
Miami, Florida 33131 
Re: Service as a Special Master 
Dear Judge Davis: 
Thank you for agreeing to serve as a Special Master and for assisting the United States 
Attorney's Office in the selection of an attorney representative to represent a group of identified 
victims. This letter is meant to assist you in performing your duties by providing you with 
background information regarding the agreement between the United States and Jeffrey Epstein 
and the duties that the attorney representative will have to perform. 
The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Attorney's Office conducted an 
investigation of Mr. Epstein. As a result of that investigation, the U.S. Attorney's Office and Mr. 
Epstein entered into a Non-Prosecution Agreement and an Addendum that contains, inter alia , 
the following terms: 
7A. The United States has the right to assign to an independent third-party the 
responsibility for consulting with and, subject to the good faith approval of 
Epstein's counsel, selecting the attorney representative for the individuals identified 
under the Agreement. If the United States elects to assign this responsibility to an 
independent third-party, both the United States and Epstein retain the right to make 
good faith objections to the attorney representative suggested by the independent 
third-party prior to the final designation of the attorney representative. 
7B. The parties will jointly prepare a short written submission to the independent 
third-party regarding the role of the attorney representative and regarding Epstein's 
Agreement to pay such attorney representative his or her regular customary hourly 
rate for representing such victims subject to the provisions of paragraph 7C, infra. 
7C. Pursuant to additional paragraph 7A, Epstein has agreed to pay the fees of the 
attorney representative selected by the independent third party. This provision, 
however, shall not obligate Epstein to pay the fees and costs of contested litigation 
filed against him. Thus, if after consideration of potential settlements, an attorney 
representative elects to file a contested lawsuit pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2255 or 
elects to pursue any other contested remedy, the paragraph 7 obligation of the 
Agreement to pay the costs of the attorney representative, as opposed to any 
statutory or other obligations to pay reasonable attorneys fees and costs such as 
those contained in § 2255 to bear the costs of the attorney representative, shall 
cease. 
8.If any of the individuals referred to [in the paragraphs above] elects to file suit 
pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2255, Epstein will not contest the jurisdiction of the United 
States District Court for the Southern District of Florida over his person and/or the 
subject matter, and Epstein waives his right to contest liability and also waives his 
EFTA00013623
--- PAGE 2 ---
right to contest damages up to an amount agreed to between Epstein and the 
identified individual, so long as the identified individual elects to proceed 
exclusively under 18 U.S.C. § 2255, and agrees to waive any other claim for 
damages, whether pursuant to state, federal, or common law. Notwithstanding this 
waiver, with respect to those individuals whose names appear on the list provided 
by the United States, Epstein's signature on this agreement, his waivers and failures 
to contest liability and such damages in any suit are not to be construed as an 
admission of any criminal or civil liability. 
9.Epstein's signature on this agreement also is not to be construed admission of 
civil or criminal liability or a waiver of any jurisdictional or other defense as to any 
person whose name does not appear on the list provided by the United States. 
10.Except as to those individuals who elect to proceed exclusively under 18 U.S.C. 
§ 2255, as set forth in [the above paragraphs], neither Epstein's signature on this 
agreement, nor its terms, nor any resulting waivers or settlements by Epstein are to 
be construed as admissions or evidence of civil or criminal liability or a waiver of 
any jurisdictional or other defense as to any person, whether or not her name 
appears on the list provided by the United States. 
The most recent version of the statute referenced above, 18 U.S.C. § 2255, provides that: 
Any person who, while a minor, was a victim of a violation of section . . . 2422 or 
2423 of this title and who suffers personal injury as a result of such violation, 
regardless of whether the injury occurred while such person was a minor, may sue 
in any appropriate United States District Court and shall recover the actual 
damages such person sustains and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable 
attorney's fee. Any person as described in the preceding sentence shall be deemed 
to have sustained damages of no less than $150,000 in value. a 
Section 2422 prohibits the use of a facility of interstate commerce to induce minors to 
engage in sexual activity and prostitution, and section 2423 prohibits interstate travel for the 
purpose of engaging in sexual activity or prostitution with minors . The United States has 
identified 34 victims as defined by this statute. The United States takes no position as to the 
validity of any such claim under this statute. 
Due to the circumstances of the case and the number and caliber of the attorneys who 
represent Mr. Epstein, in selecting the victims' attorney representative, the United States suggests 
that you consider the following criteria: 
I. Experience doing both plaintiffs' and defense litigation. 
I. Experience with state and federal statutory and common law tort claims. 
I. The ability to communicate effectively with young women. 
I. Experience litigating against large law firms and high profile attorneys who may test the 
veracity of the victims' claims. 
I. Sensitivity to the nature of the suit and the victims' interest in maintaining their privacy. 
I. Experience litigating in federal court in the Southern District of Florida. 
I. The resources to hire experts and others, while working on a contingency fee basis, in 
order to prepare for trial, if a settlement cannot be reached (defense counsel has reserved 
the right to challenge such litigation). 
I. The ability to negotiate effectively. 
Pursuant to this letter, the United States assigns to you the responsibility for consulting 
with and selecting the attorney representative for the individuals. The United States and Epstein 
retain the right to make good faith objections to the attorney representative you select prior to the 
final designation of the attorney representative. In that regard, after you have reached a decision 
EFTA00013624
--- PAGE 3 ---
regarding the attorney representative, please provide me with his or her name and contact 
information. 
If I can provide you with any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me 
and/or the U.S. Attorney and/or Jay Leflcowitz, Esq. on behalf of Epstein. Mr. Lefkowitz can be 
reached at I 
- Kirkland & Ellis LLP, Citigroup Center, 153 East 53 rd Street, New

Sincerely, 
R. Alexander Acosta 
United States Attorney

a An earlier version of this statute deems that any person described in the preceding sentence shall have 
sustained damages of no less than $50,000 in value.

How will system judge 
Palm Beach predator? 
We soon will find out whether 
big money can buy from the crimi-
nal justice system what everyone 
assumes that big money can buy. 
The penalty news reports say 
part-time Palm Beach resident 
Jeffrey Epstein is expected to face 
suggests that he wiD plead guilty 
to something more than one felony 
count for solicitation of prostitution. 
A Palm Beach County grand jury 
indicted the Manhattan money 
manager on that charge in July 
2006. But a guilty plea that does not 
recognize the age of the girls whom 
police say the billionaire paid for 
sex would be a disservice to the 
girls, an insult to the investigators 
who pressed the case and, for good 
measure, a general outrage. 
Palm Beach police have said that 
Jeffrey Epstein. 54, paid underage 
girls, one as young as 14, to come to 
his 7,200-square-foot waterfront home 
for "massage" sessions. fblice said 
interviews with five alleged victims 
and 17 witnesses under oath, phone 
messages, a high school transcript 
and other items they found in Mr. 
Epstein's trash and home show that 
he knew how young the girls were. 
But after Mr Epstein's attorneys told 
prosecutors about the girls' MySpace 
pages, which mentioned marijuana 
and alcohol use, State Attorney Barry 
Krischer sent the case to a grand jury. 
instead of filing charges himself 
Blaming these victims, however, 
does not make them any more de-
serving of what happened. And Mr. 
Krischer's unnecessary handoff to a 
grand jury, after an 11-month police 
investigation, more than reinforced 
Jeffrey Epstein case 
comes to turning point. 
the public understanding that 
the more money the accused has, 
the bigger the break he gets. Mc 
Epstein% legal team includes West 
Palm Beach defense attorney Jack 
Goldberger, Harvard Law School 
Professor Alan Dershowitz, who 
worked on the OJ. Simpson murder 
case, and Kenneth Starr, who once 
pursued a president based on his 
lies about sex with young women. 
Federal authorities also stepped 
in, which stalled the state% case 
for another year. On Nov. 9, citing 
an unnamed source close to Jeffrey 
Epstein, Jose Lambiet of The Post 
wrote that the federal investigation 
is over, and Mc Epstein is ex 
to serve up to 18 months an could 
be labeled a sex offender in crimi-
nal records. The charge the grand 
jury returned more than a year ago 
carries a maximum five-year prison 
term and no "sex offender label. 
"This case," Mr. Goldberger told 
Mr. Lambiet, "is absolutely going to 
end without a trial within the next 
two months" State attorney spokes-
man Michael Edmondson would 
not confirm any plea deal. But, he 
noted: 'The state attorney's hands 
are not tied by there being a single 
grand jury charge. That does not 
preclude additional charges" 
Jeffrey Epstein, like too many 
men in Florida. preyed on teenaged 
girls. The system should not let him 
buy his way out of that reality

Billionaires Are Free 
')PRINIT 
And, these days, a dime a dozen. But even for today's b boys, there are 
some things money can't buy. 
• By Vanessa Grigoriadis 
Deep in the wilds of Chelsea, there is a door. The door has a screen, and the jet-black eye 
EFTA00013635
--- PAGE 2 ---
of a promoter behind that screen, peeping out to gauge your social viability. Are you a 
model? Or a billionaire? It will be hard to get in otherwise. 
Around midnight, the most beautiful young models in the city arrive, squired in quickly, 
their backs with shoulder blades like arrows disappearing inside. Door, as the nightclub is 
creatively called, popped up late this summer. No one is supposed to know it's there. It is 
where moguls go: After the Yahoo board meeting, Jeny Yang and David Filo came by. 
Mother night in the fall, Sergey Brin and Larry Page were there. Supermarket billionaire 
Ron Burkle, Virgin head Richard Branson, and Steve Bing, the down-to-earth 
Democratic donor who inherited nearly a billion dollars from his real-estate-magnate 
grandfather, the developer of some of the most beautiful Art Deco buildings on Park 
Avenue and the West Village. Advance men for President Clinton. Few other guys can 
get in, except for a couple of model wranglers, those handsome, usually South American 
guys who round up models at their apartments and herd them to nightclubs. Promoter 
Danny A., a friend of Ron Burkle's, runs this place—he even got to go on a trip to Israel 
with President Clinton. The wranglers are the only people in here not having fun: One 
hand on a mojito, they are nervous as they text madly on the phone to more girls, more 
girls, more girls. 
For the rest of the city, the door is closed. A few handsome bankers wait on the sidewalk 
outside the club for a half-hour, scraping their shoes. "I guess I'm a zero-value-added 
person in this equation," says one, stepping away, disappointed. 
At the very pinnacle of the New York social scene these days is the billionaire, once a 
reclusive character who secretively moved world markets from his castle on the hill but 
now is more likely to be dining at a booth next to you. They're everywhere: This year, for 
the first time, everyone on the Forbes 400 list was a billionaire, up from thirteen 
billionaires in the early eighties. One can imagine them, swathed in Pyrex, looking down 
from their apartments in new designer buildings at our tenement buildings and bobbing 
umbrellas, as though the world outside were some vast boho terrarium. 
Now that it seems you need a million dollars just to stay alive, the cultural imagination 
has been captured by a billion. "I've met six billionaires!" crowed a friend of mine, 
counting them on his hands, and then correcting himself-"Seven!" Our mayor, of 
course, is a billionaire five times over, with seven homes, a few worth $10 million, and a 
Florida estate he bought for his daughter to strengthen her equestrian training. Over 
brunch on a recent Sunday, my girlfriends and I chatted about their Saturday night out—
this one talked to one of the Dells; that one sat next to Stewart Rahr, the pharmaceutical 
mogul and owner of the most expensive home in the Hamptons; and everyone saw Ian 
Schrager. 
"He's not a billionaire!" huffed one of my friends, outraged at our ignorance. 
To be a billionaire is to be radically free. You are your own galaxy. You make your own 
rules, hang out with the former president, send tourists to space. Billionaire investor

palace on 71st Street—though his business, naturally, is located on a 70-acre private 
island in the Virgin Islands—was humiliated this summer when his lifestyle was made 
public. Epstein was known to be a womanizer: He usually travels with three women, who 
are "strictly not of our class, darling," says a friend. They serve his guests dinner on his 
private 727, and are also there for touching. 
But it seems that he was also interested in oun er women: Over the past few years, a 
then-17-year-old 
brought at least five high-school 
girls between the ages of 14 and 16 over to Epstein's house in Palm Beach to "massage" 
him, which meant watching him masturbate and even allegedly having sex. Epstein's 
defense seems to be that he didn't know the girls were minors, and that he is "very 
passionate about massage," as one of his lawyers says. 
Those who know Epstein say he's unfazed by his travails. "He's totally open about his 
life: His life is about making money and living an erotic life, and his escape isn't alcohol 
or drugs-it's sex," says a friend. "I was talking to him the other day, and he said to me 
that he was doing well and working steadily—between massages." 
In books, the billionaire has become a symbol of ultimate power and freedom—they're 
Gatsbys, yes, but they own the light at the end of the dock. In Michael Tolkin's The 
Return of the Player, the player tries to make a fortune working for a $750,000,000 man 
(a pauper) and the billionaire who pulls his strings. The billionaire tells the player: "You 
don't know what a few extra decimal places taste like. There are wines—my God, you 
don't know what they do for you—from vineyards that stopped selling to the public about 
forty popes ago ... The provenance of this [Rembrandt] is without blemish, and the 
painting has never been publicly catalogued, like a lot of the most amazing pieces in the 
world, and I paid for it using the interest of the interest of the interest. A hundred and 
twenty-five million dollars. I had more money an hour after I signed the check than I did 
when I bought it." 
But art falls short when describing the lives of billionaires. Steve Wynn is free enough to 
afford to buy a Picasso, even when his eyesight is famously challenged, and to rip a hole 
in that Picasso with his elbow while distractedly showing the painting before he closed 
the deal with hedge-fund billionaire Steve Cohen to buy it for $139 million, which would 
have been the highest price ever paid for a work of art. Convinced that the elbow gaffe 
was fate, Wynn decided to keep the picture—what's $139 million, after all, to a man like 
him? 
A billionaire has the wherewithal to match his moral vanity: While the rest of us struggle 
to keep our heads above water, billionaires are saving the world. There's Branson's 
pledge to invest the next ten years of profit from his Virgin Group's airline and train 
businesses in renewable-energy initiatives, worth $3 billion. Bing, along with Burkle and 
others, has pledged $1 billion to do the same. In June, Warren Buffett, the thrifty bridge 
player with the five-bedroom house in Nebraska, donated $31 billion to the Bill and 
Melinda Gates Foundation for education and global development. Buffett plans to give 
away 70 percent of his fortune. "If I wanted to," he has said, "I could hire 10,000 people 
EFTA00013637
--- PAGE 4 ---
to do nothing but paint my picture every day for the rest of my life. And the gross 
national product would go up." But "there's no reason future generations of Buffetts 
should command society just because they came from the right womb. Where's the 
justice in that?" 
Billionaires can seem to have a power to conceal their actions that the Greek goddess 
Athena would have understood—and they are as susceptible as any mortal to believing 
their own mythology. But this can lead to problems when their power is questioned, as 
possibly happened to this year's chattering-class billionaire, Ron Burkle, the mysterious 
53-year-old who made his fortune in the very non-mysterious business of investing in 
supermarkets. Burkle—who also works with President Clinton—is a fixture at the Mercer 
Hotel, where he prefers to have breakfast and meetings when he's in town, instead of in 
his office at Clinton's headquarters in Harlem. He has a pied-a-terre under renovation in 
New York—which he splits with Leonardo DiCaprio—but is looking for something 
nicer. He offered $17 million in cash to the owner of Sky Studios, the city's preeminent 
bachelor pad, with rooftop pool, on lower Broadway, several times, but the owner, 
himself a rich man, won't take anything under $17.2 million. They go back and forth 
about it—pennies between stubborn men. 
A large part of Burkle's life is spent doing business for unions—hence the script on his 
757 private plane, "770BB," or Box Boy Local 770, the union he was in when he started 
as a bag boy. He has given generously to the Urban League, Harlem Children's Zone, and 
UCLA, among others. Some portion of the other half of his life is spent being glamorous. 
He's invested in Scoop, the fancy boutique chain, and has anonymously underwritten 
model enthusiasms, like his $200,000 contribution to Petra Nemcova's charity benefit for 
tsunami victims. His stunning home in Los Angeles, Green Acres, is the most exceptional 
charity-event space in the city—$100 million has been raised there in the past year, with 
$1 million at a recent Clinton event. This fall, when the California governor asked his 
help, he flew the Dalai Lama from New York and back. 
It's difficult to live in the public eye while keeping full control of your image, even for a 
billionaire, as Burkle found when he made the acquaintance of a "Page Six" writer of 
questionable wardrobe and integrity named Jared Paul Stern. Burkle caught Stem on tape 
allegedly trying to shake him down—but possibly in this case the cure was worse than 
the disease, with Burkle, by many accounts an ordinary guy who does his own laundry, 
suddenly as famous as Brad Pitt. 
To defend his zone of privacy, Burkle has put together a fearsome, cloak-and-daggerish 
security apparatus, including crisis manager Mike Sitrick (who was brought in to quiet 
things down when hedge-fund manager Bruce McMahan was accused of conducting an 
affair with his own daughter) and Frank Renzi (who was in President Clinton's Secret 
Service detail). 
His wife—who petitioned for alimony of $410,000 per month but eventually received 
$40,000—provided a sobering view of the end of billionaire romance: "My husband is 
enormously wealthy, a billionaire, has his own 757 jet, and literally could track me down 
EFTA00013638
--- PAGE 5 ---
anywhere in the world," she testified. "He is used to exerting control over all the people 
he comes into contact with, including myself ... He cannot stand losing—anything!" 
It may not always be this way with billionaires. The new crop of Internet billionaires 
seem to have learned from the example of their forerunners and are determined to live 
life differently in the "Gooveau Riche" era. Sergey Brin and Larry Page guard their 
privacy so closely that little is known about where they live other than it's in Palo Alto, 
and the most impressive cars they own are Priuses. When Brin and Page met with the 
Stanford grad students who started YouTube to negotiate the deal earlier this week, it was 
for lunch at a Denny's. They do, however, own their own Boeing 767 jet, which includes 
two bedrooms and hammocks hung from the common-room ceiling. 
Hammocks may not be the style of billionaire Roustam Tariko, the Russian banking and 
vodka tycoon, but he has a similarly freewheeling approach to life. Tariko had one of the 
city's most incredible parties at the foot of the Statue of Liberty, to toast his new brand of 
vodka. Over a thousand people, dressed in their finest bling, gathered there to eat borscht 
and caviar under the lit statue. I remember Tariko running around, slightly flushed in a 
pressed suit with a crisp white collar, greeting everyone from Helena Christensen to 
Donna Karan as Duran Duran played their old hits onstage. 
More recently, it was rumored he'd bought Picasso's Dora Maar With Cat for $95 
million. Tariko told Lillian Ross that he had done nothing of the sort. "Not me," he said. 
"Art dealers from all over the world are now asking me to buy Picassos, other 
Impressionists. I prefer Renaissance, Caravaggio. But I do not buy them. I'd rather invest 
in my freedom, rather than in my walls."

Cash Casual: Epstein 
dresses down. 
Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of Mystery 
He's pals with a passel of Nobel Prize—winning scientists, CEOs like Leslie 
Wexner of the Limited, socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, even Donald Trump. 
But it wasn't until he flew Bill Clinton, Kevin Spacey, and Chris Tucker to 
Africa on his private Boeing 727 that the world began to wonder who he is. 
• By Landon Thomas Jr. 
He comes with cash to bum, a fleet of airplanes, and a keen 
eye for the ladies -- to say nothing of a relentless brain that 
challenges Nobel Prize—winning scientists across the 
country -- and for financial markets around the world. Ever 
since the Post's "Page Six" ran an item about the president's 
late-September visit to Africa with Kevin Spacey and Chris 
Tucker -- on his new benefactor's customized Boeing 727 — 
the question of the day has been: Who in the world is Jeffrey 
Epstein? 
It's a life full of question marks. Epstein is said to run $15 
billion for wealthy clients, yet aside from Limited founder 
Leslie Wexner, his client list is a closely held secret. A 
former Dalton math teacher, he maintains a peripatetic salon of brilliant scientists yet 
possesses no bachelor's degree. For more than ten years, he's been linked to Manhattan-
London society figure Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the mysteriously deceased media 
titan Robert Maxwell, yet he lives the life of a bachelor, logging 600 hours a year in his 
various planes as he scours the world for investment opportunities. He owns what is said 
to be Manhattan's largest private house yet runs his business from a 100-acre private 
island in St. Thomas. 
Power on Wall Street has generally accrued to those who have made their open bids for 
it. Soros. Wasserstein. Kravis. Weill. The Sturm and Drang of their successes and failures 
has been played out in public. Epstein breaks the mold. Most everyone on the Street has 
heard of him, but nobody seems to know what the hell he is up to. Which is just the way 
he likes it. 
"My belief is that Jeff maintains some sort of money-management firm, though you won't 
get a straight answer from him," says one well-known investor. "He once told me he had 
300 people working for him, and I've also heard that he manages Rockefeller money. But 
one never knows. It's like looking at the Wizard of Oz -- there may be less there than 
meets the eye." 
Says another prominent Wall Streeter: "He is this mysterious, Gatsbyesque figure. He 
likes people to think that he is very rich, and he cultivates this air of aloofness. The whole 
thing is weird." 
EFTA00013640
--- PAGE 2 ---
The wizard that meets the eye is spare and fit; with a long jaw and a carefully coiffed 
head of silver hair, he looks like a taller, younger Ralph Lauren. A raspy Brooklyn accent 
betrays his Coney Island origins. He spends an hour and fifteen minutes every day doing 
advanced yoga with his personal instructor, who travels with him wherever he goes. He is 
an enthusiastic member of the Trilateral Commission and the Council on Foreign 
Relations. 
He dresses casually -- jeans, open-necked shirts, and sneakers -- and is rarely seen in a 
tie. Indeed, those close to him say the reason he quit his board seat at the Rockefeller 
Institute was that he hated wearing a suit. "It feels like a dress," he told one friend. 
Epstein likes to tell people that he's a loner, a man who's never touched alcohol or drugs, 
and one whose nightlife is far from energetic. And yet if you talk to Donald Trump, a 
different Epstein emerges. "I've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy," Trump booms 
from a speakerphone. "He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful 
women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it --
Jeffrey enjoys his social life." 
But beautiful women are only a part of it. Because here's the thing about Epstein: As 
some collect butterflies, he collects beautiful minds. "I invest in people -- be it politics or 
science. It's what I do," he has said to friends. And his latest prize addition is the former 
president. In his eyes, Clinton as a species represents the highest evolutionary form of the 
political animal. To be up close to him, as he was during the African journey, is akin to 
seeing the rarest of beasts on a safari. As he put it to a friend upon his return from Africa, 
"If you were a boxer at the downtown gymnasium at 14th Street and Mike Tyson walked 
in, your face would have the same look as these foreign leaders had when Clinton entered 
the room. He is the world's greatest politician." 
"Jeffrey is both a highly successful financier and a committed philanthropist with a keen 
sense of global markets and an in-depth knowledge of twenty-first-century science," 
Clinton says through a spokesman. "I especially appreciated his insights and generosity 
during the recent trip to Africa to work on democratization, empowering the poor, citizen 
service, and combating HIV/AIDS." 
Before Clinton, Epstein's rare appearances in the gossip columns tended to be speculation 
as to the true nature of his relationship with Ghislaine Maxwell. While they are still 
friends, the English tabloids have postulated that Maxwell has longed for a more 
permanent pairing and that for undetermined reasons Epstein has not reciprocated in 
kind. "It's a mysterious relationship that they have," says society journalist David Patrick 
Columbia. "In one way, they are soul mates, yet they are hardly companions anymore. It's 
a nice conventional relationship, where they serve each other's purposes." 
Friends of the two say that Maxwell, whose social life has always been higher-octane 
than Epstein's, lent a little pi77a77 to the lower-profile Epstein. Indeed, at a party at 
EFTA00013641
--- PAGE 3 ---
Maxwell's house, her friends say, one is just as apt to see Russian ladies of the night as 
one is to see Prince Andrew. The Oxford-educated Maxwell, described by many as a 
man-eater (she flies her own helicopter and was recently seen dining with Clinton at 
Nello's on Madison Avenue), lives in her own townhouse a few blocks away. Epstein is 
frequently seen around town with a bevy of comely young women but there has been no 
boldfaced name to replace Maxwell. "You may read about Jeffrey in the social columns, 
but there is much more to him than that," says Jeffrey T. Leeds of the private equity firm 
Leeds Weld & Co. "He's a talented money manager and an extremely hardworking 
person with broad interests. Most unusual, though, is that in this media-obsessed age he is 
not in any sense a self-promoter." 
Born in 1953 and raised in Coney Island, Epstein went to Lafayette High School. 
According to his bio, he took some classes in physics at Cooper Union from 1969 to 
1971. He left Cooper Union in 1971 and attended NYU's Courant Institute, where he took 
courses in mathematical physiology of the heart, leaving that school, too, without a 
degree. Between 1973 and 1975, Epstein taught calculus and physics at the Dalton 
School. 
By most accounts, he was something of a Robin Williams-in-Dead Poets Society type of 
figure, wowing his high-school classes with passionate mathematical riffs. So impressed 
was one Wall Street father of a student that he said to Epstein point-blank: "What are you 
doing teaching math at Dalton? You should be working on Wall Street -- why don't you 
give my friend Ace Greenberg a call." 
Epstein was in many respects the perfect candidate for Greenberg's consideration. 
Greenberg, a senior partner at Bear Stearns at the time and a legendary trader in his own 
right, has long made it clear that it's the hungry, brilliant guys lacking the fancy degrees 
that he favors at Bear. They even have an acronym: PSDs -- poor, smart, and a deep 
desire to be rich. It was a description that fit Epstein to a T. He was a Brooklyn guy with 
a motor for a brain, and while he did love teaching, this close-up view of the rarefied 
Upper East Side life of his students' gave him a taste for the big time. 
So in 1976, he dropped everything and reported to work at Bear Stearns, where he started 
off as a junior assistant to a floor trader at the American Stock Exchange. His ascent was 
rapid. 
At the time, options trading was an arcane and dimly understood field, just beginning to 
take off. To trade options, one had to value them, and to value them, one needed to be 
able to master such abstruse mathematical confections as the Black-Scholes option-
pricing model. For Epstein, breaking down such models was pure sport, and within just a 
few years he had his own stable of clients. "He was not your conventional broker saying 
'Buy IBM' or 'Sell Xerox,'" says Bear Steams CEO Jimmy Cayne. "Given his 
mathematical background, we put him in our special-products division, where he would 
advise our wealthier clients on the tax implications of their portfolios. He would 
EFTA00013642
--- PAGE 4 ---
recommend certain tax-advantageous transactions. He is a very smart guy and has 
become a very important client for the firm as well." 
In 1980, Epstein made partner, but he had left the firm by 1981. Working in a 
bureaucracy was not for him; what's more, in rubbing up against ever greater sums of 
money during his time at Bear, he began to feel the need to grab his own piece of the 
action. 
In 1982, according to those who know Epstein, he set up his own shop, J. Epstein and 
Co., which remains his core business today. The premise behind it was simple: Epstein 
would manage the individual and family fortunes of clients with $1 billion or more. 
Which is where the mystery deepens. Because according to the lore, Epstein, in 1982, 
immediately began collecting clients. There were no road shows, no whiz-bang 
marketing demos -- just this: Jeff Epstein was open for business for those with $1 billion—
plus. 
His firm would be different, too. He was not here just to offer investment advice; he saw 
himself as the financial architect of every aspect of his client's wealth -- from investments 
to philanthropy to tax planning to security to assuaging the guilt and burdens that large 
sums of inherited wealth can bring on. "I want people to understand the power, the 
responsibility, and the burden of their money," he said to a colleague at the time. 
As a teacher at Dalton, he had witnessed firsthand the troubled attitudes of some of the 
poor little rich kids under his charge; at Bear, he had come to the realization that, 
counterintuitively, the more money you had, the more anxious you became. For a middle-
class kid from Brooklyn, it just didn't make sense. 
From the get-go, his business was successful. But the conditions for investing with 
Epstein were steep: He would take total control of the billion dollars, charge a flat fee, 
and assume power of attorney to do whatever he thought was necessary to advance his 
client's financial cause. And he remained true to the $1 billion entry fee. According to 
people who know him, if you were worth $700 million and felt the need for the services 
of Epstein and Co., you would receive a not-so-polite no-thank-you from Epstein. 
It's nice work if you can get it. Epstein runs a lean operation, and those close to him say 
that his actual staff -- based here in Manhattan at the Villard House (home to Le Cirque); 
New Albany, Ohio; and St. Thomas, where he reincorporated his company seven years 
ago (now called Financial Trust Co.) -- numbers around 150 and is purely administrative. 
When it comes to putting these billions to work in the markets, it is Epstein himself 
making all the investment calls -- there are no analysts or portfolio managers, just twenty 
accountants to keep the wheels greased and a bevy of assistants -- many of them 
conspicuously attractive young women -- to organize his hectic life. So assuming, 
conservatively, a fee of .5 percent (he takes no commissions or percentages) on $15 
billion, that makes for a management fee of $75 million a year straight into Jeff Epstein's 
pocket. Nice work indeed. 
EFTA00013643
--- PAGE 5 ---
It has been rumored that Linda Wachner and David Rockefeller have been clients, too, 
but both parties deny any such relationship. What's more, who ever heard of a financial 
adviser turning down $500 million accounts? All the speculation and mystery has proved 
fertile ground for some alternative Jeffrey Epstein stories -- the most bizarre of which has 
him playing the piano (he is classically trained) for high rollers in a Manhattan piano bar 
in the mid-eighties. 
Another focus of curiosity is the relationship that Epstein has with his patron and mentor 
Leslie Wexner, founder and chairman of the Columbus, Ohio—based Limited chain of 
women's-clothing stores. Wexner, who is said to be worth more than $2.5 billion by 
Forbes, became an Epstein client in 1987. "It's a weird relationship," says another Wall 
Streeter who knows Epstein. "It's just not typical for someone of such enormous wealth to 
all of a sudden give his money to some guy most people have never heard of." The 
Wexner-Epstein relationship is indeed a multifaceted one. 
Given the secrecy that envelops Epstein's client list, some have speculated that Wexner is 
the primary source of Epstein's lavish life -- but friends leap to his defense. "Let me tell 
you: Jeffrey Epstein has other clients besides Wexner. I know because some of them are 
my clients," says noted m&a lawyer Dennis Block of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft. 
"I sent him a $500 million client a few years ago and he wouldn't take him. Said the 
account was too small. Both the client and I were amazed. But that's Jeffrey." 
Epstein' s current residence in Manhattan -- a 45,000-square-foot eight-story mansion on 
East 71st Street -- was originally bought by Wexner for $13 million in 1989. Wexner 
poured many millions into a full gut renovation, then turned it over to Epstein in 1995 
after he got married. One story has Epstein paying only a dollar for it, though others say 
he paid full market price, which would have been in the neighborhood of $20 million. 
Epstein then undertook his own $10 million gut renovation (special features: closed-
circuit TV and a heated sidewalk in front of the house for melting snow), saying to 
friends: "I don't want to live in another person's house." 
There are other houses as well, including a sweeping villa in Palm Beach and a custom-
built 51,000-square-foot castle in Santa Fe. Said to be the largest house in the state, the 
latter sits atop a hill on a 45,000-acre ranch. He had it built because of the month or so he 
found himself spending there, talking elementary particle physics with his friend Murray 
Gell-Man, a Nobel Prize—winning physicist and co-chair of the science board at the Santa 
Fe Institute. 
Epstein also owned a grand house (he has since sold it) near Wexner's opulent manse at 
the center of the Limited magnate's high-end housing development in New Albany, Ohio. 
New Albany was a lush sprawl of farmland on the outskirts of Columbus that Wexner, 
starting in 1988, turned into a rich village of multimillion-dollar Georgian homes 
surrounding a Jack Nicklaus—designed golf course. It was a massive development project, 
financed largely by Wexner himself. Epstein was a general partner in the real-estate 
EFTA00013644
--- PAGE 6 ---
holding company, called New Albany Property, despite putting only a few million dollars 
of capital into the project. 
"Before Epstein came along in 1988, the financial preparations and groundwork for the 
New Albany development were a total mess," says Bob Fitrakis, a Columbus-based 
investigative journalist who has written extensively on Wexner and his finances. "Epstein 
cleaned everything up, as well as serving Wexner in other capacities -- such as 
facilitating visits to Wexner's home of the crew from Cats and organizing a Tony Randall 
song-and-dance show put on in Columbus." Wexner declines to talk about his 
relationship with Epstein, but it is clearly one that continues to this day. Not that it helped 
Epstein in any way to land Clinton. Wexner is a staunch Republican donor, and Epstein, 
aside from a small contribution to the president's legal-defense fund, has given more to 
the likes of former senator Al D'Amato. 
What attracted Clinton to Epstein was quite simple: He had a plane (he has a couple, in 
fact -- the Boeing 727, in which he took Clinton to Africa, and, for shorter jaunts, a black 
Gulfstream, a Cessna 421, and a helicopter to ferry him from his island to St. Thomas). 
Clinton had organized a weeklong tour of South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana, Rwanda, and 
Mozambique to do what Clinton does. So when the president's advance man Doug Band 
pitched the idea to Epstein, he said sure. As an added bonus, Kevin Spacey, a close friend 
of Clinton's, and actor Chris Tucker came along for the ride. 
While Epstein got an intellectual kick out of engaging African finance ministers in 
theoretical chitchat about economic development, the real payoff for him was observing 
Clinton in his métier: talking HIV/aids policy with African leaders and soaking up the 
love from Cape Town to Lagos. 
Epstein brings a trophy-hunter's zeal to his collection of scientists and politicians. But the 
real charge for him is in seeing these guys work it. Like former Democratic Senate leader 
George Mitchell, for example. In Epstein's mind, Mitchell is the world's greatest 
negotiator, based on his work in Ireland and the Middle East. So he wrote the senator a 
bunch of checks. Says Mitchell: "He has supported some philanthropic projects of mine 
and organized a fund-raiser for me once. I would certainly call him a friend and a 
supporter." 
But it is his covey of scientists that inspires Epstein's true rapture. Epstein spends $20 
million a year on them -- encouraging them to engage in whatever kind of cutting-edge 
research might attract their fancy. They are, of course, quite lavish in their praise in 
return. Gerald Edelman won the Nobel Prize for physiology and medicine in 1972 and 
now presides over the Neurosciences Institute in La Jolla. "Jeff is extraordinary in his 
ability to pick up on quantitative relations," says Edelman. "He came to see us recently. 
He is concerned with this basic question: Is it true that the brain is not a computer? He is 
very quick." 
EFTA00013645
--- PAGE 7 ---
Then there is Stephen Kosslyn, a psychologist at Harvard. Epstein flew up to Kosslyn's 
laboratory in Cambridge this year to witness an experiment that Kosslyn was conducting 
and Epstein was funding. Namely: Is it true that certain Tibetan monks are capable of 
holding a distinct mental image in their minds for twenty minutes straight? "We 
disproved the thesis," says Kosslyn. "Jeff was on his cell phone most of the time -- he 
actually wanted to short the Tibetan market, because he thought the monk was so stupid. 
He is amazing. Like a honeybee -- he talks to all these different people and cross-
pollinates. Just two months ago, I was talking to him about a new alternative to 
evolutionary psychology. He got excited and sent me a check." 
Epstein has a particularly close relationship with Martin Nowak, an Austrian biology and 
mathematics professor who heads the theoretical-biology program at the Institute for 
Advanced Study at Princeton. Nowak is examining how game theory can be used to 
answer some of the basic evolutionary questions -- e.g., why, in our Darwinian society, 
does altruistic behavior exist? Epstein talks to Nowak about once a week and flies him 
around the country to his various homes to deliver impromptu lectures. Over the past 
three years, he has written $500,000 worth of checks to fund Nowak's research. This past 
February, Epstein had Nowak over for dinner at the 71st Street townhouse. It was just the 
two of them (not including the wait staff), and Nowak, making use of a blackboard in the 
formal dining room, delivered a two-hour highly mathematical description of how 
language works. 
After dinner, Epstein asked if Nowak wanted to meet up with his new friend President 
Clinton, and off they went to a nearby deli, where Clinton regaled the starstruck former 
Oxford professor with tales from his own Oxford days. "Jeffrey has the mind of a 
physicist. It's like talking to a colleague in your field," says Nowak. "Sometimes he 
applies what we talk about to his investments. Sometimes it's for his own curiosity. He 
has changed my life. Because of his support, I feel I can do anything I want." 
Danny Hillis, an MIT-educated computer scientist whose company, Thinking Machines, 
was at the forefront of the supercomputing world in the eighties, and who used to run 
R&D at Walt Disney Imagineering, thinks Epstein is actually using scientific knowledge 
to beat the markets. "We talk about currency trading -- the euro, the real, the yen," he 
says. "He has something a physicist would call physical intuition. He knows when to use 
the math and when to throw it away. If I had acted upon all the investment advice he has 
been giving me over the years, I'd be calling you from my Gulfstream right now." 
On the 727 these days, he has been reading a book by E. O. Wilson, the eminent scientist 
and originator of the field of sociobiology, called Consilience, which makes the case that 
the boundaries between scientific disciplines are in the process of breaking down. It's a 
view Epstein himself holds. He wrote recently to a scientist friend of his: "The behavior 
of termites, together with ants and bees, is a precursor to trust because they have an 
extraordinary ability to form relationships and sophisticated social structures based on 
mutual altruism even though individually they are fundamentally dumb. Money itself is a 
derivative of trust. If we can figure out how termites come together, then we may be able 
to better understand the underlying principles of market behavior -- and make big 
EFTA00013646
--- PAGE 8 ---
money." 
So how do termite grouping patterns fare as an investment strategy? Again, facts are hard 
to come by. A working day for Epstein starts at 5 a.m., when he gets up and scours the 
world markets on his Bloomberg screen -- each of his houses, in New York, St. Thomas, 
Palm Beach, and New Mexico, as well as the 727, is equipped with the necessary 
hardware for him to wake up, roll out of bed, and start trading. He will put some calls in 
to his private banker at JPMorgan to get a reading as to how wealthy investors -- the best 
gauge of market sentiment, he believes -- are reacting to the market's movements. Then 
he will call currency traders in Europe. On a given day, he will spend ten hours or so on 
the phone -- after all, he is running $15 billion essentially by himself. 
Strangely enough, given his scientific obsessions, he is a computer-phobe and does not 
use e-mail. "I like to hear voices and see faces when I interact," he has said. Given the 
huge sums he has to invest, he focuses on assets with extremely high liquidity, like 
currencies -- though he dabbles in commodities and real estate as well. Those who know 
him say he is an impulsive, quick-to-change-his-mind trader, still governed by Ace 
Greenberg's trader's maxim: If the stock is down 10 percent, sell it. He has been on the 
short side of the Brazilian real, and those close to him say bets there have paid off in 
spades. He recently took a long position on the euro before its rebound on the basis that 
Europeans were too proud to see their currency sink any lower against the dollar. His 
next targets: an across-the-board short of the German stock exchange and a possible 
attack on the Hong Kong dollar peg in light of the recent disclosure of North Korea's 
nuclear-weapons program. 
None of this is investment rocket science, but getting the direction and the timing right, 
no matter how conventional the investment idea, can spin large money for an investor. 
Before taking a big position, Epstein will usually fly to the country in question. He 
recently spent a week in Germany meeting with various government officials and 
financial types, and he has a trip to Brazil coming up in the next few weeks. On all of 
these trips, he flies alone in his commercial-jet-size 727. 
Friends of Epstein say he is horrified at the recent swell of media attention around him 
(Vanity Fair is preparing a megaprofile, and the Villard House office has had a barrage of 
calls from other media outlets). He has never granted a formal interview, and did not 
offer one to this magazine, nor has his picture appeared in any publication. Yet for one so 
obsessive about his privacy, one wonders -- didn't he realize that flying Clinton and 
Spacey around Africa was going to blow his cover? As he said to a friend: "If my 
ultimate goal was to stay private, traveling with Clinton was a bad move on the 
chessboard. I recognize that now. But you know what? Even ICasparov makes them. You 
move on."

How will system judge 
Palm Beach predator? 
We soon will find out whether 
big money can buy from the crimi-
nal justice system what everyone 
assumes that big money can buy. 
The penalty news reports say 
part-time Palm Beach resident 
Jeffrey Epstein is expected to face 
suggests that he wiD plead guilty 
to something more than one felony 
count for solicitation of prostitution. 
A Palm Beach County grand jury 
indicted the Manhattan money 
manager on that charge in July 
2006. But a guilty plea that does not 
recognize the age of the girls whom 
police say the billionaire paid for 
sex would be a disservice to the 
girls, an insult to the investigators 
who pressed the case and, for good 
measure, a general outrage. 
Palm Beach police have said that 
Jeffrey Epstein. 54, paid underage 
girls, one as young as 14, to come to 
his 7,200-square-foot waterfront home 
for "massage" sessions. fblice said 
interviews with five alleged victims 
and 17 witnesses under oath, phone 
messages, a high school transcript 
and other items they found in Mr. 
Epstein's trash and home show that 
he knew how young the girls were. 
But after Mr Epstein's attorneys told 
prosecutors about the girls' MySpace 
pages, which mentioned marijuana 
and alcohol use, State Attorney Barry 
Krischer sent the case to a grand jury. 
instead of filing charges himself 
Blaming these victims, however, 
does not make them any more de-
serving of what happened. And Mr. 
Krischer's unnecessary handoff to a 
grand jury, after an 11-month police 
investigation, more than reinforced 
Jeffrey Epstein case 
comes to turning point. 
the public understanding that 
the more money the accused has, 
the bigger the break he gets. Mc 
Epstein% legal team includes West 
Palm Beach defense attorney Jack 
Goldberger, Harvard Law School 
Professor Alan Dershowitz, who 
worked on the OJ. Simpson murder 
case, and Kenneth Starr, who once 
pursued a president based on his 
lies about sex with young women. 
Federal authorities also stepped 
in, which stalled the state% case 
for another year. On Nov. 9, citing 
an unnamed source close to Jeffrey 
Epstein, Jose Lambiet of The Post 
wrote that the federal investigation 
is over, and Mc Epstein is ex 
to serve up to 18 months an could 
be labeled a sex offender in crimi-
nal records. The charge the grand 
jury returned more than a year ago 
carries a maximum five-year prison 
term and no "sex offender label. 
"This case," Mr. Goldberger told 
Mr. Lambiet, "is absolutely going to 
end without a trial within the next 
two months" State attorney spokes-
man Michael Edmondson would 
not confirm any plea deal. But, he 
noted: 'The state attorney's hands 
are not tied by there being a single 
grand jury charge. That does not 
preclude additional charges" 
Jeffrey Epstein, like too many 
men in Florida. preyed on teenaged 
girls. The system should not let him 
buy his way out of that reality

5. 
Defendant Jeffrey Epstein is a citizen and resident of the State of New York. 
6. 
This is an action for damages in excess of $50 million. 
7. 
This Court has jurisdiction of this action and the claims set forth herein pursuant to 28 
U.S.C. §1332(a), as the matter in controversy (i) exceeds $75,000, exclusive of interest and costs; 
and (ii) is between citizens of different states. 
8. 
This Court has venue of this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1391(a) as a substantial 
part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred in this District. 
Factual Allegations 
9. 
At all relevant times, Defendant Jeffrey Epstein ("Epstein") was an adult male, 52 
years old. Epstein is a financier and money manager with a secret clientele limited exclusively to 
billionaires. He is himself a man of tremendous wealth, power and influence. He maintains his 
principal home in New York and also owns residences in New Mexico, St. Thomas and Palm Beach, 
FL. The allegations herein concern Epstein's conduct while at his lavish estate in Palm Beach. 
10. 
Upon information and belief, Epstein has a sexual preference and obsession for 
underage minor girls. He engaged in a plan and scheme in which he gained access to primarily 
economically disadvantaged minor girls in his home, sexually assaulted these girls, and then gave 
them money. In or about 2005, Jane Doe, then 14 years old, fell into Epstein's trap and became one 
of his victims. 
11. 
Upon information and belief, Jeffrey Epstein carried out his scheme and assaulted 
girls in Florida, New York and on his private island, known as Little St. James, in St. Thomas. 
12. 
An integral player in Epstein's Florida scheme was 
HERMAN & MERMELSTEIN, P. A. 
- 2 - 
www.hermanlaw.com 
EFTA00013651
--- PAGE 3 ---
. She recruited girls ostensibly to give a 
wealthy man a massage for monetary compensation in his Palm Beach mansion. Under Epstein's 
plan, Ms. 
would be contacted when Epstein was planning to be at his Palm Beach residence 
or soon after he had arrived there. Epstein or someone on his behalf directed Ms. 
to bring 
one or more underage girls to the residence. Ms. 
', upon information and belief, generally 
sought out economically disadvantaged underage girls from Loxahatchee and surrounding areas who 
would be enticed by the money being offered - generally $200 to $300 per "massage" session - and 
who were perceived as less likely to complain to authorities or have credibility if allegations of 
improper conduct were made. This was an important element of Epstein's plan. 
13. 
Epstein's plan and scheme reflected a particular pattern and method. Upon arrival at 
Epstein's mansion, Mr. MI 
would introduce each victim to 
who gathered the girl's personal information, including her name and telephone number. Ms. 
would then bring the girl up a flight of stairs to a bedroom that contained a massage table in addition 
to other furnishings. There were photographs of nude women lining the stairway hall and in the 
bedroom. Ms. 
would then leave the girl alone in this room, whereupon Epstein would enter 
wearing only a towel. He would then remove his towel, lay down naked on the massage table, and 
direct the girl to remove her clothes. He then would perform one or more lewd, lascivious and 
sexual acts, including masturbation and touching the girl's vagina with a vibrator. 
14. 
Consistent with the foregoing plan and scheme, Ms. 
recruited Jane Doe to 
give Epstein a massage for monetary compensation. Ms. 
brought Jane to Epstein's mansion 
in Palm Beach. Jane was introduced to ME., 
who led her up the flight of stairs to the room 
with the massage table.

15. 
After Epstein had completed the assault, he left the room. Jane was then able to get 
dressed, leave the room and go back down the stairs. She then met Ms. 
again who brought 
Jane home. Jane was paid $300 by Epstein. Ms. 
was paid $200 by Epstein for bringing Jane 
to him. 
16. 
As a result of this encounter with Epstein, the 14-year old Jane experienced 
confusion, shame, humiliation, embarrassment and the assault sent her life into a downward spiral.

17. 
Plaintiff Jane Doe by and through her Father, as parent and natural guardian, repeats 
and realleges paragraphs 1 through 16 above. 
18.

recognizes as a crime the lewd and lascivious acts committed by Epstein upon Jane. 
20. 
As a direct and proximate result of Epstein's assault on Jane, she has suffered and will 
continue to suffer severe and permanent traumatic injuries, including mental, psychological and 
emotional damages. 
WHEREFORE, PlaintiffJane Doe, by and through her Father, as parent and natural guardian,

Hi 
Here is the info that I have. Jeopardy attaches at the start of the presentation of evidence at trial, 
so a s ou not be an issue. 
The bigger problem is the statute of limitations. A defendant can waive his right to challenge the statute under 
Florida law, but I don't think that Epstein will be willing to do so. 
At this point he also could demand a speedy trial. Once he has done so, if the trial is not held very quickly, he 
can move for "discharge." Once "discharged," Epstein cannot be prosecuted on the crime charged or any other 
crimes that could have been charged as a result of the same conduct or criminal episode. The State cannot avoid 
this bar by filing a "Nolle Prosequi" and then trying to re-file the same or different charges based on the same 
conduct or criminal episode. 
Please let me know if you need anything else.

Hi 
The state indictment is related to two girls. One of those girls is included in the federal 
indictment, the other is not. The state indictment charges solicitation of adult prostitution, it does not charge any 
child exploitation offense, despite the fact that, under Florida law, neither lack of knowledge of age nor 
affirmative misrepresentation of age by the victim is a defense. 
EFTA00013656
--- PAGE 2 ---
The victim from the state case who is referenced in the federal indictment told Epstein her true age and 
he engaged in full sexual intercourse with her a few days shy of her 18th birthday. For that birthday, he gave her 
a series of gifts, including lingerie. The other 18 girls named in the current indictment are not part of the state 
indictment. 
The state case currently has a trial date set for July. Before we got involved, the police were told that 
Epstein was going to plead to a misdemeanor and get no jail time. (That is one of the reasons why they asked 
the FBI to step in.) Since the federal investigation began, Epstein's counsel have continued the case repeatedly 
on the basis that they cannot resolve that case until the federal case is resolved. As part of the non-prosecution 
agreement that the Office put together with Epstein, the federal case was supposed to be resolved if Epstein 
agreed to three main terms: (1) he had to plead to a state offense for which sex offender registration was 
required, specifically, the procurement of minors to engage in prostitution; (2) he had to agree to an 18-month 
term of incarceration; and (3) he had to agree to pay restitution and damages to the victims. After the agreement 
was signed, he then tried to escape all three requirements. 
He objected to pleading to the state charge, claiming that the facts did not apply, and asked to plead to a 
non-registrable offense instead. When we responded that there were four other registrable offenses where the 
facts certainly fit, those were rejected because (1) they required registration and (2) the state sentencing 
guidelines for those offenses were too high. 
He tried to arrange to get out on work release, which would allow him to "work" anywhere he liked 
during the day and sleep in a halfway house, rather than a jail, at night. When he learned that sex offenders 
weren't allowed to be a part of the work release program, he started complaining about the jail time. He now 
wants to get a "suspended sentence" and/or home confinement, instead. 
He complained that he should be able to fully litigate the issues of liability and damages with regard to 
the third term of the agreement, despite his agreement directly to the contrary. 
With respect to the current status of the state case, other than the new trial date, all that I know is that 
Epstein is now subpoenaing victims for depositions who are not included in the state indictment. (Under Florida 
law, defense counsel are allowed to depose witnesses, including victims, prior to trial.) He seems to be trying to 
use that process to get information about the federal investigation. I do not know whether Epstein's 
misdemeanor deal is back on the table because the defense demanded that we have no contact with the State 
Attorney's Office, so I haven't spoken with the ASA in over 6 months. 
I wish I had more information to give you. If you would like me to reach out to either the local detective 
on the state case or the Assistant State Attorney, please let me know. Or, if you would like their contact info, I 
can forward that to you, too. 
Thank you. I will be back in the office tomorrow and you can call me there with any other questions.

Hi all — So sorry to bother you on a Saturday, but I am hoping that I can persuade you to reach out toMabout Epstein's 
investigators harassing the girls. 
received a frantic call today about Epstein's investigators bothering the parents of 
one of the victims. According to the victim, he demanded to see the victim and when he saw her, he told the victim that 
they had video of till"
, were planning to put it on the intemet. We don't believe that Epstein actually has video of 
any of the girls, and 
as calmed the girl down, but this activity seems to be getting more aggressive. Remember 
also that Epstein is using the state criminal case to subpoena depositions of victims in the federal case (who are not part of 
the state indictment) to get information about our invention. These actions do not seem consistent with what Epstein's 
attorneys are supposed to be trying to work out with 
in DC. Any chance 
will ask Epstein's people to call off 
their dogs until he makes his decision?

extremely gracious in stating that you did not want the United States to be "unfair". Although CEOS limited its assessment 
to the federal statutes our
 had brought forth and to the application of those laws to the facts as presented, it is 
abundantly clear from 
letter that Main Justice is not directing this prosecution. In fact, CEOS plainly acknowledged 
that a federal prosecution of Mr. Epstein would involve a 'novel application' of federal statutes and that our arguments 
against federal involvement are 'compelling.' Moreover, the language used by Drew in his concluding paragraph, that he 
cannot conclude that a prosecution by you in this case "would be an abuse of discretion" is hardly an endorsement that you 
move forward. 
Moreover, as you know, Drew made clear that the scope of his review did not extend to the other significant issues we 
have raised with you, such as the undo interest by some members of your staff with the financial and civil aspects of this 
matter, or with the inappropriate discussion one member of your Office had with a senior reporter at the New York Times. 
(In fact, I have met with that reporter and have reviewed copious notes of his conversation with Mr. Weinstein). At this 
stage, we have no alternative but to raise our serious concems regarding the issues Drew refused to address with the 
Deputy or, if necessary, the Attorney General, because we believe those issues have significantly impacted the 
investigation and any recommendation by your staff to proceed with an indictment. That being said, it would obviously be 
much more constructive and efficient if we could resolve this matter directly with you in the advance of further proceedings 
in Washington. 
Because it is clear that national policy, as determined by Main Justice, is not driving this case, the resolution of this matter 
is squarely, and solely, your responsibility. I know you want to do the right thing, and it is because you have made clear to 
EFTA00013661
--- PAGE 2 ---
me on several occasions that you will always look at all of the relevant and material facts that I call the following to your 
attention. New information that has come to light strongly suggests that the facts of this case cannot possibly implicate a 
federal prosecutorial priority. Due to established state procedures and following the initiation of multiple civil lawsuits, Mr. 
Epstein's counsel was able to take limited discovery of certain women in this matter. The sworn statements provided by 
these women all confirm that federal prosecution is not appropriate in this case. 
The consistent representations of witnesses such a 
and the civil complainants and their attorneys, confirm the following key points: First, there was no telephonic 
communication that met the requirements of § 2422(b). For example, as many other witnesses have stated, Ms. 
testified in no unclear terms that there was never any discussion over the phone about her coming over to Mr. Epstein's 
home to engage in sexual activity: "The only thing that ever occurred on any of these phone calls [wi 
another assistant] was, 'Are you willing to come over,' or, 'Would you like to come over and give a massage.'" 
Tr. A 
at 15. Second, the underage women who visited Mr. Epstein have testified that they lied about their age in order to gain 
admittance into his home and women who brought their underage friends to Mr.lpai counseled them to lie about their 
ages as well. Ms. 
stated the following: "I would tell my girlfriends just like 
approached me. Make sure you 
tell him you're 18. Well, these girls that I brought, I know that they were 18 or 19 or 20. And the girls that I didn't know and 
I don't know if they were lying or not, I would say make sure that you tell him you're 18." 
Tr. at 22. Third, there was 
no routine or habit suggesting an intent to transform a massage into an illegal sexual act. For instance, Ms. 
stated 
that Mr. Epstein "never touched [her] physically" and that all she did was "massage( ] his back, his chest and his thighs and 
that was it." 
Tr. at 12-13. Finally, as you are well aware, there was no force, coercion, fraud, violence, drugs, or 
even alcohol present in connection with Mr. Epstein's encounters with these women. 
The civil suits confirm that the plaintiffs did not discuss engaging in sexually-related activities with anyone prior to arriving 
at Mr. Epstein's residence. This reinforces the fact that no telephonic or Internet persuasion, inducement, enticement or 
coercion of any kind occurred. Furthermore, Mr. Herman, the attorney for most of the civil complainants, was quoted in the 
Palm Beach Post as saying that "it doesn't matter" that his clients lied about their ages and told Mr. Epstein that they were 
or 19. In short, the new evidence establishing that the women deliberately lied about their age because they knew Mr. 
Epstein did not want anyone under 18 in his house directly undercuts the claim that Mr. Epstein willfully blinded himself as 
to their ages. Willful blindness is not a substitute for evidence of knowledge nor is it a negligence standard. It requires 
proof beyond reasonable doubt of deliberate intent and specific action to hide one's knowledge. There is absolutely no 
such evidence of that here, so it is not even a jury issue. Furthermore, willful ignorance cannot constitute the required 
mens rea for a crime of conspiracy or aiding and abetting. 
Through the recent witness statements, we have also discovered another serious issue that implicates the integrity of the 
federal investigation. We have learned that FBI Special Agent 
attempted to convince these adult women, now 
in their twenties, that they were in fact "victims" even though the women themselves strongly disagreed with this 
characterization. This conduct, once again, goes to the heart of the integrity of the investigation. In a sworn statement, 
Ms. 
was highly critical of the overreaching by federal law enforcement officers in this case. She testified—in no 
uncertain terms—that she does not, and never did, feel like a "victim," despite the fact that the FBI repeatedly tried to 
convince her otherwise. 
I am mindful of the fact that we have a state court date of July 8 on which either to enter a plea or to commence trial. As I 
review the trial options with Mr. Epstein, I certainly want to make sure I do everything within my power to obviate a need for 
trial through a reasonable alternative resolution. Although it is dear that CEOS is not directing a prosecution here, and has 
stated only that you have the authority to commence such a prosecution, I am well aware that the decision whether to 
proceed, subject to any further process in Washington, is now within your discretion. I think the new facts should greatly 
influence your decision and accordingly, I hope you will agree to meet with me, both to discuss the new evidence and to 
discuss a resolution to this matter once and for all. I am available to meet with you at your earliest convenience subject to 
our mutual availability.

Well, 
epstein's pricey lawyers may have cost him $200 million. I reviewed the docket sheets for the 4 pending federal 
suits (they are all jeff herman suits) and judge marra has issued orders to show cause why default judgments shouldn't be 
entered for all 4. Herman asked for $50 million in each one. Apparently epstein tried to avoid service and ignored the 
deadline when the complaints were mailed to him (thinking that was ineffective service). All I can say is, so much money, 
so little skill.

Re:

Dear Mr. Tein:

(5611820-8711 
Facsimile: (5611 820-8777 
July 17, 2008 
The Office has reviewed your "Notice of Continued Pendency of Federal Criminal 
Action," and we feel that it misrepresents the posture of the federal investigation. For 
example, you cite to In re Grand Jury, No. FGJ 07-103 (WPB), as evidence that the federal 
criminal action remains pending. That is a citation to Mr. Epstein's Motion to Quash a 
subpoena for computer equipment removed from Mr. Epstein's home after he and his 
attorneys were aware of the existence of the state investigation. Pursuant to the Non-
Prosecution Agreement, that motion was supposed to have been withdrawn several months 
ago, and, therefore, is not "pending" in our estimation. 
The Non-Prosecution Agreement calls for deferment of federal prosecution "in favor 
of prosecution by the State of Florida, provided that Epstein abides by the [enumerated] 
conditions and the requirements of th[e] Agreement ..." (Non-Prosecution Agreement, p. 
(emphasis added).) One of those conditions is Epstein's agreement that the subject Jane 
Does, while minors, were victims of a violation of an offense enumerated in Title 18, United 
States Code Section 2255, and that they "will have the same rights to proceed under Section 
2255 as [they] would have had if Mr. Epstein had been tried and convicted of an enumerated 
offense." (United States Attorney's December 19, 2007 letter to Lilly Ann Sanchez.) 
If, in fact, your position is that the federal criminal action is still pending such that the 
Court must stay the civil proceedings. then the Office proposes that we seek the prompt 
resolution of the Motion to Quash, so that the computer equipment can be analyzed and the

federal investigation can continue. If, instead. Mr. Epstein intends to fully abide by the Non-
Prosecution Agreement, then the "federal Grand Jury investigation will remain suspended, 
and all pending federal Grand Jury subpoenas will be held in abeyance unless and until 
[Epstein] violates any term of [the Non-Prosecution Agreement]." (Non-Prosecution 
Agreement, page 5.) 
Please advise whether you intend to correct the representations to the Court regarding 
the status of the federal investigation. 
Sincerely,

Epstein shall waive all challenges to the Information filed by the State 
Attorney's Office and shall waive the right to appeal his conviction and 
sentence, except a sentence that exceeds what is set forth in paragraph 
(2), supra. 
6. 
Epstein shall provide to the U.S. Attorney's Office copies of all

EFTA00013682
--- PAGE 4 ---
• 
proposed agreements with the State Attorney's Office prior to entering 
into those agreements. 
7. 
The United States shall provide Epstein's attorneys with a list of 
individuals whom it has identified as victims, as defined in 18 U.S.C. 
§ 2255, after Epstein has signed this agreement and been sentenced. 
Upon the execution of this agreement, the United States, in consultation 
with and subject to the good faith approval of Epstein's counsel, shall 
select an attorney representative for these persons, who shall be paid for 
by Epstein. Epstein's counsel may contact the identified individuals 
through that representative. 
• 
• 
8. 
If any of the individuals referred to in paragraph (7), supra, elects to 
file suit pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2255, Epstein will not contest the 
jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District 
of Florida over his person and/or the subject matter, and Epstein waives 
his right to contest liability and also waives his right to contest damages 
up to an amount as agreed to between the identified individual and 
Epstein, so long as the identified individual elects to proceed 
exclusively under 18 U.S.C. § 2255, and agrees to waive any other 
claim for damages, whether pursuant to state, federal, or common law. 
Notwithstanding this waiver, as to those individuals whose names 
appear on the list provided by the United States, Epstein's signature on 
this agreement, his waivers and failures to contest liability and such 
damages in any suit are not to be construed as an admission of any 
criminal or civil liability. 
9. 
Epstein's signature on this agreement also is not to be construed as an 
admission of civil or criminal liability or a waiver of any jurisdictional 
or other defense as to any person whose name does not appear on the 
list provided by the United States. 
10. 
Except as to those individuals who elect to proceed exclusively under 
U.S.C. § 2255, as set forth in paragraph (8), supra, neither Epstein's 
signature on this agreement, nor its terms, nor any resulting waivers or 
settlements by Epstein are to be construed as admissions or evidence of 
civil or criminal liability or a waiver of any jurisdictional or other 
defense as to any person, whether or not her name appears on the list 
provided by the United States. 
11. 
Epstein shall use his best efforts to enter his guilty plea and be

• 
sentenced not later than October 26, 2007. The United States has no 
objection to Epstein self-reporting to begin serving his sentence not 
later than January 4, 2008. 
12. 
Epstein agrees that he will not be afforded any benefits with respect to 
gain time, other than the rights, opportunities, and benefits as any other 
inmate, including but not limited to, eligibility for gain time credit 
based on standard rules and regulations that apply in the State of 
Florida. At the United States' request, Epstein agrees to provide an 
accounting of the gain time he earned during his period of 
incarceration. 
13. 
The parties anticipate that this agreement will not be made part of any 
public record. If the United States receives a Freedom of Information 
Act request or any compulsory process commanding the disclosure of 
the agreement, it will provide notice to Epstein before making that 
disclosure. 
Epstein understands that the United States Attorney has no authority to require the 
State Attorney's Office to abide by any terms of this agreement. Epstein undcrstands that 
it is his obligation to undertake discussions with the State Attorney's Office and to use his 
best efforts to ensure compliance with these procedures, which compliance will be necessary 
to satisfy the United States' interest. Epstein also understands that it is his obligation to use 
his best efforts to convince the Judge of the 15th Judicial Circuit to accept Epstein's binding 
recommendation regarding the sentence to be imposed, and understands that the failure to 
do so will be a breach of the agreement. 
In consideration of Epstein's agreement to plead guilty and to provide compensation 
in the manner described above, if Epstein successfully fulfills all of the terms and conditions 
of this agreement, the United States also agrees that it will not institute any criminal ch 
es 
a ainst an 
otential co-cons irators of E stein including but not limited to 
o 
Further, upon execution of this 
agreement and a plea agreement with the State Attorney's Office, the federal Grand Jury 
investigation will be suspended, and all pending federal Grand Jury subpoenas will be held 
in abeyance unless and until the defendant violates any term of this agreement. The 
defendant likewise agrees to withdraw his pending motion to intervene and to quash certain 
grand jury subpoenas. Both parties agree to maintain their evidence, specifically evidence 
requested by or directly related to the grand jury subpoenas that have been issued, and 
including certain computer equipment, inviolate until all of the terms of this agreement have 
been satisfied. Upon the successful completion of the terms of this agreement, all 
outstanding grand jury subpoenas shall be deemed withdrawn.

EFTA00013684
--- PAGE 6 ---
• 
By signing this agreement, Epstein asserts and certifies that each of these terms is 
material to this agreement and is supported by independent consideration and that a breach 
of any one of these conditions allows the United States to elect to terminate the agreement 
and to investigate and prosecute Epstein and any other individual or entity for any and all 
federal offenses. 
• 
• 
By signing this agreement, Epstein asserts and certifies that he is aware of the fact that 
the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States provides that in all criminal 
prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial. Epstein further 
is aware that Rule 48(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that the Court 
may dismiss an indictment, information, or complaint for unnecessary delay in presenting 
a charge to the Grand Jury, filing an information, or in bringing a defendant to trial. Epstein 
hereby requests that the United States Attorney for the Southern District ofFlorida defer such 
prosecution. Epstein agrees and consents that any delay from the date of this Agreement to 
the date of initiation of prosecution, as provided for in the terms expressed herein, shall be 
deemed to be a necessary delay at his own request, and he hereby waives any defense to such 
prosecution on the ground that such delay operated to deny him rights under Rule 48(b) of 
the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the 
United States to a speedy trial or to bar the prosecution by reason of the running of the statute 
of limitations for a period of months equal to the period between the signing of this 
agreement and the breach of this agreement as to those offenses that were the subject of the 
grand jury's investigation. Epstein further asserts and certifies that he understands that the 
Fifth Amendment and Rule 7(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provide that all 
felonies must be charged in an indictment presented to a grand jury. Epstein hereby agrees 
and consents that, if a prosecution against him is instituted for any offense that was the 
subject of the grand jury's investigation, it may be by way of an Information signed and filed 
by the United States Attorney, and hereby waives his right to be indicted by a grand jury as 
to any such offense.

IN RE: 
INVESTIGATION OF 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN 
ADDENDUM TO THE NON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENT 
IT APPEARING that the parties seek to clarify certain provisions of page 4, paragraph 7 
of the Non-Prosecution Agreement (hereinafter "paragraph 7"), that agreement is modified as 
fol lows: 
7A. 
The United States has the right to assign to an independent third-party the responsibility 
for consulting with and, subject to the good faith approval of Epstein's counsel, selecting 
the attorney representative for the individuals identified under the Agreement. If the 
United States elects to assign this responsibility to an independent third-patty, both the 
United States and Epstein retain the right to make good faith objections to the attorney 
representative suggested by the independent third-party prior to the final designation of 
the attorney representative. 
7B. 
The parties will jointly prepare a short written submission to the independent third-party 
regarding the role of the attorney representative and regarding Epstein's Agreement to 
pay such attorney representative his or her regular customary hourly rate for representing 
such victims subject to the provisions of paragraph C, infra. 
7C. 
Pursuant to additional paragraph 7A, Epstein has agreed to pay the fees of the attorney 
representative selected by the independent third party. This provision, however, shall not 
obligate Epstein to pay the fees and costs of contested litigation filed against him. Thus, 
if after consideration of potential settlements, an attorney representative elects to file a 
contested lawsuit pursuant to 18 U.S.C. s 2255 or elects to pursue any other contested 
remedy, the paragraph 7 obligation of the Agreement to pay the costs of the attorney 
representative, as opposed to any statutory or other obligations to pay reasonable 
attorneys fees and costs such as those contained in s 2255 to bear the costs of the attorney 
representative, shall cease.

Hi 
This is not meant as pestering. I just know that the Miami paper hasn't covered Epstein like 
they have up here. This is a link to a site that, for some unknown reason, has compiled most of the "legitimate" 
newspaper stories about Epstein. It does not contain the recent story in the London newspapers about Epstein's 
link to Prince Andrew. If you want a link to that story, let me know. [As an aside about the London article/leak 
issue, the day after we put a key witness in the grand jury, a London reporter called the witness' attorney to ask 
whether his client had appeared before the grand jury yet. So wherever the leak is, it is of international 
proportions.]

Alex - I wanted to thank you for making the time for 
breakfast Friday. It was great to catch up. 
Following up on our conversation about the date for Mr. 
Epstein's plea, where you said that you didn't want to 
dictate a schedule to the state, as we discussed I have 
a case where I represent an individual who is now the 
lead witness for the government, and openings are set 
for next week. Accordingly, I have now confirmed with 
Mr. Epstein's Florida counsel that the state's 
attorney's office and the court will be available to 
have him enter his plea on November 20. So we will 
plan to proceed on one that date. Please confirm that 
this is ok. 
Thanks, Jay

Re: Jeffrey Epstein 
Facsimile: 
(212) 4464900 
I write in response to your recent letter, dated November 5, 2007. I want to make clear at 
the outset that Mr. Epstein is complying fully with the Non Prosecution Agreement (the 
"Agreement") and that he has every intention of continuing to honor its terms in good faith. Any 
disagreement the parties have regarding the terms of the Agreement should be resolved through 
open dialogue and should not be construed as a repudiation of the Agreement. I do, however, 
want to address each of the points you raise in your letter. 
First, we do not believe Mr. Epstein's agents are precluded from speaking to any 
individuals at this point in time. We carefully reviewed the Agreement and the laws governing 
contact with witnesses and proceeded under the belief that Mr. Epstein's agents could properly 
contact potential witnesses in this matter. We believe that nothing in the Agreement precludes 
contact by Mr. Epstein's agents with any individuals. Paragraph 7 of the Agreement states that 
"Epstein's counsel may contact the identified individuals through [the attorney representative]," 
but it in no way restricts any other contacts that are both lawful and appropriate. Furthermore, 
your Office has not yet identified the alleged victims under 18 U.S.C. § 2255 nor has an attorney 
representative been selected. 
Indeed, it is quite common for a party's agents, and even his attorneys, to speak with 
potential claimants prior to their retaining formal representation. And in this situation — where 
Mr. Epstein faces significant potential civil exposure, and he has a right to test the veracity of 
these claims — it is appropriate that his agents would seek to obtain as much information about 
potential claims as possible. Nevertheless, because we want to cooperate with your Office and 
since you object to such communications, we will cease all contact with these individuals until 
the date of Mr. Epstein's plea. We request, however, that your Office provide a basis for 
precluding Mr. Epstein or his agents from speaking to any individuals at this time.

Second, I am a little surprised by your insistence that we request that the state court 
conduct the plea and sentence in November. You may recall that we previously discussed, and 
you agreed, that because the state judge will not stagger the plea and sentencing as we 
contemplated in the Agreement, Mr. Epstein could plea and be sentenced at any point before 
January 4, 2008. As you know, the judge's refusal to stagger the plea and sentencing actually 
harms Mr. Epstein because this delays the timing under which he can receive the names of the 
individuals identified by the United States as "victims" under § 2255. But we believe we must 
defer to the judge's decision in this matter. To clear up any misunderstanding, however, the 
judge has set this case "for trial" on January 7 only as a formal matter. The judge has invited the 
parties to appear for the plea and sentencing on January 4, and we do not anticipate any delay 
beyond that date. 
Third, I want to clear up any confusion regarding the many inaccurate media reports 
about Mr. Epstein. With the hope of maintaining some semblance of privacy for Mr. Epstein, we 
have avoided interacting with the media regarding this matter. Indeed, the only recent comment 
was Howard Rubenstein's confirmation to the Palm Beach Daily News that this matter had been 
resolved and would not proceed to a trial. That comment was authorized only out of concern that 
you might read an inaccurate story and believe, mistakenly, that Mr. Epstein had decided not to 
proceed under the Agreement. 
Fourth, regarding the sentence to be imposed by the court, the Agreement, and all of the 
discussions we have had about it, are very clear: Mr. Epstein is to be sentenced to an 18-month 
term in accordance with the same rules and regulations (and the same rights and privileges) that 
apply to everyone in the state of Florida. That Mr. Epstein would be treated no better and no 
worse than anyone else was a material term of the Agreement. If your Office now believes he is 
not entitled to equal treatment, I would very much appreciate an explanation of the basis of such 
view. I am sufficiently concerned about comments in your letter to seek clarification on this 
point, especially because the lawyers in your Office have made clear on numerous occasions to 
me that as long as Mr. Epstein received an I8-month sentence, your Office would not seek to 
interfere with the implementation of the state sentence. 
Fifth, pursuant to the Agreement, Mr. Epstein, through his counsel, agrees to provide the 
agreements made with the State Attorney's Office. 
Finally, I must tell you that I am troubled by the manner in which your Office has dealt 
with the § 2255 issues that are encompassed in the Agreement. As you already know, one of the 
lawyers initially recommended by your Office contacted Judge Davis to lobby for the assignment 
of attorney representative even before Judge Davis was formally selected to appoint an attorney 
representative. Moreover, I find it highly unusual that your Office has continued to insist that a 
EFTA00013699
--- PAGE 3 ---
KIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP 
November 8, 2007 
Page 3 
primary criteria for the appointment of the attorney representative should be the ability to take on 
contingency fee cases directed at Mr. Epstein. I trust you understand that I raise these concerns 
with you out of respect for your Office. However, despite Mr. Epstein's full intention to abide 
by all of the terms of the Agreement, we must reserve our right to object to certain aspects of the 
§ 2255 provisions of the Agreement. 
I look forward to continuing to work with your Office to resolve any outstanding issues, 
and I sincerely anticipate a conclusion of this matter in the very near future. 
Sincerely, 
EFTA00013700

No, I think he is pleading on December 16th, and we should definitely try to keep that date on track.

Epstein believes that January 4th not December 16th is when he'll plead guilty and be sentenced. Judging from 
email, it seems that January 4th is the date. Hopefully, Ill hear from Judge Davis today or tomorrow. Thanks,

- Beyond my letter the other day, and your email 
to me from a few weeks ago, is there anything else you 
need from me regarding the plea and sentencing dates. 
As we discussed, and as we have confirmed, the Court 
has told us she will handle both at the same time (plea 
before sentencing, obviously), and to the agreed-upon 
counts, on Jan 4. I trust I have cleared up any 
confusion regarding Jan 7. 
Thx. Jay

Jay, 
Please accept my apologies for not getting back to you sooner but I was a little under the weather yesterday. I hope that 
you enjoyed your Thanksgiving. 
Regarding the issue of due diligence concerning Judge Davis' selection, I'd like to make a few observations. First, Guy Lewis 
has known for some time that Judge Davis was making reasonable efforts to secure Aaron Podhurst and Bob Josephsberg 
for this assignment. In fact, when I told you of Judge Davis's selection during our meeting last Wednesday, November 21", 
you and Professor Dershowitz seemed very comfortable, and certainly not surprised, with the selection. Podhurst and 
Josephsberg are no strangers to nearly the entire Epstein defense team including Guy Lewis, Lili Ann Sanchez, Roy Black, 
and, apparently, Professor Dershowitz who said he knew Mr. Josephsberg from law school. Second, Podhurst and 
Josephsberg have long-standing stellar reputations for their legal acumen and ethics. It's hard for me to imagine how 
much more vetting needs to be done. 
The United States has a statutory obligation (Justice for All Act of 2004) to notify the victims of the anticipated upcoming 
events and their rights associated with the agreement entered into by the United States and Mr. Epstein in a timely 
fashion. Tomorrow will make one full week since you were formally notified of the selection. I must insist that the vetting 
EFTA00013706
--- PAGE 2 ---
process come to an end. Therefore, unless you provide me with a good faith objection to Judge Davis's selection by COB 
tomorrow, November 28, 2007, I will authorize the notification of the victims. Should you give me the go-ahead on 
Podhurst and Josephsberg selection by COB tomorrow, I will simultaneously send you a draft of the letter. I intend to 
notify the victims by letter after COB Thursday, November 29th. Thanks,

Subject: Re: Epstein 
Dear 
I received your email yesterday and was a little surprised at the tone of your letter, given the fact that we 
spoke last week and had what I thought was a productive meeting. I was especially surprised given that your 
letter arrived on only the second day back to work after the Thanksgiving Holiday, and yet your demands 
regarding timing suggest that I have been sitting on my hands for days. 
You should know that the first time I learned about Judge Davis's selection of Podhurst and Josephsberg, 
and indeed the first time I ever heard their names, was in our meeting with you on Wednesday of last week. 
Nevertheless, I have now been able to confer with my client, and we have determined that the selection of 
Podhurst and Josephsberg are acceptable to us, reserving, of course, our previously stated objections to the 
manner in which you have interpreted the section 2255 portions of the Agreement. 
We do, however, strongly and emphatically object to your sending a letter to the alleged victims. Without a 
fair opportunity to review and the ability to make objections to this letter, it is completely unacceptable that you 
would send it without our consideration. Additionally, given that the US Attorney's office has made clear it 
cannot vouch for the claims of the victims, it would be incendiary and inappropriate for your Office to send such 
a letter. Indeed, because it is a certainty that any such letter would immediately be leaked to the press, your 
actions will only have the effect of injuring Mr. Epstein and promoting spurious civil litigation directed at him. 
We believe it is entirely unprecedented, and in any event, inappropriate for the Government to be the instigator 
of such lawsuits. 
Finally, we disagree with your view that you are required to notify the alleged victims pursuant to the 
Justice for All Act of 2004. First, 18 USC section 2255, the relevant statute under the Non-Prosecution 
Agreement for the settlement of civil remedies, does not have any connection to the Justice for All Act. Section 
2255 was enacted as part of a different statute. Second, the Justice for All Act refers to restitution, and section 
2255 is not a restitution statute. It is a civil remedy. As you know, we had offered to provide a restitution fund 
for the alleged victims in this matter; however that option was rejected by your Office. Had that option been 
chosen, we would not object to your notifying the alleged victims at this point. At this juncture, however, we do 
not accept your contention that there is a requirement that the government notify the alleged victims of a 
potential civil remedy in this case. 
Accordingly, for all the reasons we have stated above, we respectfully -- and firmly -- object to your sending 
any letter whatsoever to the alleged victims in this matter. Furthermore, if a letter is to be sent to these 
individuals, we believe we should have a right to review and make objections to that submission prior to it being 
sent to any alleged victims. We also request that if your Office believes that it must send a letter to go to the 
alleged victims, who still have not been identified to us, it should happen only after Mr. Epstein has entered his 
EFTA00013708
--- PAGE 2 ---
plea. This letter should then come from the attorney representative, and not from the Government, to avoid any 
bias. 
As you know, Judge Starr has requested a meeting with Assistant Attorney General Fisher to address what 
we believe is the unprecedented nature of the section 2255 component of the Agreement. We are hopeful that 
this meeting will take place as early as next week. Accordingly, we respectfully request that we postpone our 
discussion of sending a letter to the alleged victims until after that meeting. We strongly believe that rushing to 
send any letter out this week is not the wisest manner in which to proceed. Given that Mr. Epstein will not even 
enter his plea for another few weeks, time is clearly not of the essence regarding any notification to the identified 
individuals. 
Thanks very much,

Hi M- Only one obsessive thought last night. When you talk to Lanna, you might want to convince her that 
(assuming she agrees with my analysis) the evidence in the state case is enough to support the charge, especially 
the taped statement of 
and others who talked about recruiting other girls. I definitely do not want 
Epstein's camp to use this as an excuse to view all of our evidence, then withdraw from the plea, and then go to 
trial.

Alex - I hope all is well. I miss not speaking to so 
regularly, although I assume it means we are both able 
to focus on some other matters. 
I wanted to just give you a heads up. As you probably 
saw in the papers, Jeff Sloman's former law firm 
recently held a press conference to announce a 50 
milion dollar civil lawsuit against Epstein. They 
purportedly re resent the father and stepmother of 
. In are light of this development, we 
probably have no alternative but to go ahead and notice 
deposition in accordance with state procedure in 
the near future. 
I am traveling today, but as you know, always

Hi all — So sorry to bother you on a Saturdatt I am hoping that I can persuade you to reach out to 
about 
Epstein's investigators harassing the girls. 
received a frantic call today about Epstein's investigators 
bothering the parents of one of the victims. According to the victim, he demanded to see the victim and when he 
saw her, he told the victim that they had video of the girl and warinning to put it on the intemet. We don't 
believe that Epstein actually has video of any of the girls, and 
has calmed the girl down, but this activity 
seems to be getting more aggressive. Remember also that Epstein is using the state criminal case to subpoena 
depositions of victims in the federal case (who are not part of the state indictment) to get information about our 
investigation. These actions do not seem consistent with what Epstein's attorneys are supposed to be trying to 
work out with 
in DC. Any chance 
will ask Epstein's people to call off their dogs until he makes his 
decision?

Just received a call from 
One of Epstein's private investigators, Robert Myers, has been trying to track 
down one of our victims for several days and finally caught up with her today. She told him that she did not 
want to talk to him and he then told her that, if she wouldn't talk to him, her name would somehow appear in the 
press and she should think about how that will affect her. 
put the victim in touch with one of our pro 
bono lawyers, and also informed her of her right to contact the police if she feels she is being threatened or 
harassed. 
In the meantime, this is the latest New York press coverage of Mr. Epstein: 
Just Visiting 
JEFFREY Epstein - who's facing jail time for soliciting prostitutes, some of whom were under the age of 18 - isn't feeling the love 
stateside, so he's skipped the country (temporarily, we're assured) to feel the love in Israel. A rep said Epstein, who was spotted at the 
Tel Aviv Hilton over the weekend, "is in Israel for Passover. He's meeting with Israeli scientists about medical research he's funding and 
taking a tour of military bases with [Friends of Israel chairman) Benny Shabtal." As for his ongoing legal troubles, the rep added, "It 
should be noted that the alleged victims have all acknowledged they lied about their age."

IT APPEARING that Epstein has accepted responsibility for his behavior by his signature 
on this Agreement; and 
IT APPEARING, after an investigation of the offenses and Epstein's background, that the 
interest of the United States pursuant to the Petite policy will be served by the following procedure; 
THEREFORE, on the authority of R. Alexander Acosta, United States Attorney for the 
Southern District of Florida, prosecution in this District for these offenses shall be deferred in favor 
of prosecution by the State of Florida, provided that Epstein abides by the following conditions and 
the requirements of this Agreement set forth below. 
Should Epstein violate any of the conditions of this Agreement, the United States Attorney 
may at any time initiate prosecution against Epstein for any offense. In this case, the United States 
Attorney will furnish Epstein with notice specifying the condition(s) of the Agreement that he has 
violated. 
After timely fulfilling all the terms and conditions of the Agreement, no prosecution for the 
offenses set out on pages 1 and 2 of this Agreement will be instituted in this District, and the charges 
against Epstein if any, will be dismissed. 
Terms of the Agreement: 
1. 
Epstein shall plead guilty (not nolo contendere) to an Information filed by the 
State Attorney's Office charging violations of the following Florida Statutes: 
(a) 
lewd and lascivious battery on a child, in violation of Fl. Stat. 
800.04(4);

Stat. 796.03; and 
(c) 
engaging in sexual activity with minors at least sixteen years of age, 
in violation of Fl. Stat. 794.05. 
2. 
Epstein and the State Attorney's Office shall make a joint, binding 
recommendation that the Court impose a thirty (30) month sentence to be 
divided as follows: 
(a) 
Epstein shall begin by serving at least twenty (20) months in prison, 
without any opportunity for withholding adjudication or sentencing, 
Page 2 of 4 
EFTA00013740
--- PAGE 3 ---
and without probation or community control in lieu of imprisonment; 
and 
(b) 
following the term of imprisonment, Epstein shall serve ten (10) 
months of community control. 
3. 
Epstein shall waive all challenges to the Information filed by the State 
Attorney's Office and shall waive the right to appeal his conviction and 
sentence. 
4. 
Epstein shall provide to the U.S. Attorney's Office copies of all proposed 
agreements with the State Attorney's Office prior to entering into those 
agreements. 
5. 
Epstein agrees that, if any of the victims identified in the federal 
investigation file suit pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2255, Epstein will not contest 
the jurisdiction of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida 
over his person and/or the subject matter, and Epstein will not contest that the 
identified victims are persons who, while minors, were victims of violations 
of Title 18, United States Code, Sections(s) 2422 and/or 2423. 
6. 
The United States shall provide Epstein's attorneys with a list of the 
identified victims, which will not exceed forty, after Epstein has signed this 
agreement and has been sentenced. The United States shall make a motion 
with the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida for 
the appointment of a guardian ad litem for the identified victims and 
Epstein's counsel may contact the identified victims through that counsel. 
7. 
Epstein shall enter his guilty plea and be sentenced not later than September 
28, 2007, and shall begin service of his sentence not later than October 15, 
2007. 
8. 
With credit for gain time, Epstein shall serve at least 17 months in a state 
correctional institution. 
Epstein understands that the United States Attorney has no authority to require the State 
Attorney's Office to abide by any terms of this agreement. Epstein understands that it is his 
obligation to undertake discussion with the State Attorney's Office to ensure compliance with these 
procedures, which compliance will be necessary to satisfy the United States' interest, pursuant to 
the Petite policy. 
By signing this agreement, Epstein asserts and certifies that each of these terms is material 
to this agreement and is supported by independent consideration and that a breach of any one of 
these conditions allows the United States to elect to terminate the agreement and to investigate and 
Page 3 of 4 
EFTA00013741
--- PAGE 4 ---
prosecute Epstein for any and all federal offenses. 
By signing this agreement, Epstein asserts and certifies that he is aware of the fact that the 
Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States provides that in all criminal prosecutions 
the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial. Epstein further is aware that Rule 
48(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that the Court may dismiss an indictment, 
information, or complaint for unnecessary delay in presenting a charge to the Grand Jury, filing an 
information, or in bringing a defendant to trial. Epstein hereby requests that the United States 
Attorney for the Southern District of Florida defer such prosecution. Epstein agrees and consents 
that any delay from the date of this Agreement to the date of initiation of prosecution, as provided 
for in the terms expressed herein, shall be deemed to be a necessary delay at his own request, and 
he hereby waives any defense to such prosecution on the ground that such delay operated to deny 
him rights under Rule 48(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and the Sixth Amendment 
to the Constitution of the United States to a speedy trial or to bar the prosecution by reason of the 
running of the statute of limitations for a period of months equal to the period between the signing 
of this agreement and the breach of this agreement. Epstein further asserts and certifies that he 
understands that the Fifth Amendment and Rule 7(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 
provide that all felonies must be charged in an indictment presented to a grand jury. Epstein hereby 
agrees and consents that, if a prosecution against him is instituted, it may be by way of an 
Information signed and filed by the United States Attorney, and hereby waives his right to be 
indicted by a grand jury. 
By signing this agreement, Epstein asserts and certifies that the above has been read and 
explained to him. Epstein hereby states that he understands the conditions of this Non-Prosecution 
Agreement and agrees to comply with them.

Re: 
Jeffrey Epstein 
U.S. Department of Justice 
United States Attorney 
Southern District of Florida 
October 9, 2007 
Dear Lilly: 
Thank you for your letter to First Assistantaregarding the selection of an attorney to 
represent the victims identified in the investigation of Mr. Epstein. While I appreciate your client's 
interest in a resolution of the victim's claims without the filing of lawsuits, I do not believe that your 
proposal falls within the terms of the Non-Prosecution Agreement signed by your client and the 
United States. 
I would recommend the following. The U.S. Attorney's Office would ask Judge Davis to 
assist in the selection of one or more attorneys to represent the identified victims. If Judge Davis 
is willing to perform that limited service pro bono, Mr. Epstein will not need to pay for that service. 
The United States would provide Judge Davis with a list of criteria for the selection of the 
attomey(s). 
The selected attorney(s) would represent the victim(s) on a contingency fee basis, pursuant 
to a fee agreement reached between the victim(s) and the attomey(s). If he deems it appropriate, 
Judge Davis can propose the terms of that agreement, subject to acceptance by the victim. The 
lawyer(s) can interview each potential client to determine how they want to proceed — including 
whether she wants to use the attorney selected by Judge Davis or if she wants to choose her own 
attorney. Judge Davis can advise the selected attorney(s) of Mr. Epstein's desire to settle the cases 
out of court using Judge Davis as the mediator/special master, which the attorneys can report to their 
clients. If any one or more of the victims, in consultation with their independent counsel, wants to 
mediate the case, and agrees that Judge Davis should serve as the mediator/special master, they can 
proceed accordingly. At that point, Mr. Epstein's payment of Judge Davis's fees would be more 
appropriate.

Here's our version that we plan to send to Lefkowitz. Alex and I have read your proposed 
letter to Judge Davis and other than parts of the last paragraph concerning "consulting with 
the victims", it looks good. 
1. The United States has the right to assign to an independent third-party the responsibility 
for consulting with and, subject to the good faith approval of Epstein's counsel, selecting 
the attorney representative for the individuals identified under the Agreement. If the United 
States elects to assign this responsibility to an independent third-party, both the United 
States and Epstein retain the right to make good faith objections to the attorney 
representative suggested by the independent third-party prior to the final designation of the 
attorney representative. 
2. The parties will jointly prepare a short written submission to the independent third-party 
regarding the role of the attorney representative and regarding Epstein's Agreement to pay 
such attorney representative his or her regular customary hourly rate for representing such 
victims subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, infra. 
3. Pursuant to additional paragraph 1, Epstein has agreed to pay the fees of the attorney 
representative selected by the independent third party. This provision, however, shall not 
obligate Epstein to pay the fees and costs of contested litigation filed against him. Thus, if 
EFTA00013747
--- PAGE 2 ---
after consideration of potential settlements, an attorney representative elects to file a 
contested lawsuit pursuant to 18 U.S.C. s 2255 or elects to pursue any other contested remedy, 
the paragraph 7 obligation of the Agreement to pay the costs of the attorney representative, 
as opposed to any statutory or other obligations to pay reasonable attorneys fees and costs 
such as those contained in s 2255 to bear the costs of the attorney representative, shall 
cease.

Hi all — The FBI had their meeting with the ASA this morning. She wasn't aware of the December 16111 date, and 
she said that she could include something in their plea agreement about not beinz_.z.
,, elinible for work release. 
When the FBI asked her if she would do that, she said she wo 
to talk toM 
She also wouldn't say 
whether they would oppose such a petition, if one were filed. illar
aid that because Epstein is going to be 
housed at the jail, the Sheriff's Office will determine whether Epstein is eligible for work release, not the Florida 
Department of Corrections. I have asked FBI to find out whether "sexual predators" (which will be Epstein's 
legal designation) are eligible to participate in work release. I am still reviewing all of the statutes to see whether 
there is anything that would bar the judge from granting a petition for work release. As soon as I find an answer, 
I will let you know. 
ould still like us to do the victim notifications. The State does not have a procedure (like we do 
e era y) where the Court has to provide a separate room for victims who want to attend judicial proceedings, so 
I do not know how many victims will actually want to be present. 
M - As soon as you hear from Judge Davis, can you let me know? It is going to take us a while to track down 
everyone, especially with the holiday, and I want to make sure they have been provided adequate notice. 
Thank you.

I spoke to Lefkowitz. Lefkowitz confirmed the above understanding. We did not, however, 
discuss anything about work release —just that Epstein will be a sex offender and he'll be 
treated like any other sex offender. 
Lefkowitz confirmed that they will not contact any other victims. He also asked Jack Goldberger 
to provide him with any copies of agreements etc. he has with the State. Jay will forward them 
to me as soon as he receives them. 
Finally, Lefkowitz said that the statement in his letter that he "reserves [the] right to object to 
certain aspects of the §2255 provisions of the Agreement" refers to their belief that a lawyer 
who files a lawsuit for some of the class may have a direct conflict that may disqualify him/his 
firm if he's accepting fees to negotiate the settlement of the other members of the class. 
Lefkowitz point out the potential conflict to whoever is selected. My view is that those issues 
are between Epstein's lawyers and the victims' lawyers.

Subject: Re: Epstein 
Dear MI: 
I received your email yesterday and was a little surprised at the tone of your letter, given the fact that we spoke last 
week and had what I thought was a productive meeting. I was especially surprised given that your letter arrived on only 
the second day back to work after the Thanksgiving Holiday, and yet your demands regarding timing suggest that I have 
been sitting on my hands for days. 
You should know that the first time I learned about Judge Davis's selection of Podhurst and Josephsberg, and indeed 
the first time I ever heard their names, was in our meeting with you on Wednesday of last week. Nevertheless, I have now 
been able to confer with my client, and we have determined that the selection of Podhurst and Josephsberg are acceptable 
to us, reserving, of course, our previously stated objections to the manner in which you have interpreted the section 2255 
portions of the Agreement. 
We do, however, strongly and emphatically object to your sending a letter to the alleged victims. Without a fair 
opportunity to review and the ability to make objections to this letter, it is completely unacceptable that you would send it 
without our consideration. Additionally, given that the US Attorney's office has made clear it cannot vouch for the claims of 
the victims, it would be incendiary and inappropriate for your Office to send such a letter. Indeed, because it is a certainty 
that any such letter would immediately be leaked to the press, your actions will only have the effect of injuring Mr. Epstein 
and promoting spurious civil litigation directed at him. We believe it is entirely unprecedented, and in any event, 
inappropriate for the Government to be the instigator of such lawsuits. 
Finally, we disagree with your view that you are required to notify the alleged victims pursuant to the Justice for All Act 
of 2004. First, 18 USC section 2255, the relevant statute under the Non-Prosecution Agreement for the settlement of civil 
remedies, does not have any connection to the Justice for All Act. Section 2255 was enacted as part of a different statute. 
Second, the Justice for All Act refers to restitution, and section 2255 is not a restitution statute. It is a civil remedy. As you 
know, we had offered to provide a restitution fund for the alleged victims in this matter; however that option was rejected by 
your Office. Had that option been chosen, we would not object to your notifying the alleged victims at this point. At this 
juncture, however, we do not accept your contention that there is a requirement that the government notify the alleged 
victims of a potential civil remedy in this case. 
Accordingly, for all the reasons we have stated above, we respectfully -- and firmly -- object to your sending any letter 
whatsoever to the alleged victims in this matter. Furthermore, if a letter is to be sent to these individuals, we believe we 
should have a right to review and make objections to that submission prior to it being sent to any alleged victims. We also 
request that if your Office believes that it must send a letter to go to the alleged victims, who still have not been identified to 
us, it should happen only after Mr. Epstein has entered his plea. This letter should then come from the attorney 
representative, and not from the Government, to avoid any bias. 
EFTA00013758
--- PAGE 2 ---
As you know, Judge Starr has requested a meeting with Assistant Attorney General Fisher to address what we believe 
is the unprecedented nature of the section 2255 component of the Agreement. We are hopeful that this meeting will take 
place as early as next week. Accordingly, we respectfully request that we postpone our discussion of sending a letter to 
the alleged victims until after that meeting. We strongly believe that rushing to send any letter out this week is not the 
wisest manner in which to proceed. Given that Mr. Epstein will not even enter his plea for another few weeks, time is 
clearly not of the essence regarding any notification to the identified individuals. 
Thanks very much, 
Jay

Jay, 
Please accept my apologies for not getting back to you sooner but I was a little under the weather yesterday. I hope that 
you enjoyed your Thanksgiving. 
Regarding the issue of due diligence concerning Judge Davis' selection, I'd like to make a few observations. First, Guy 
Lewis has known for some time that Judge Davis was making reasonable efforts to secure Aaron Podhurst and Bob 
Josephsberg for this assignment. In fact, when I told you of Judge Davis's selection during our meeting last Wednesday, 
November 21st, you and Professor Dershowitz seemed very comfortable, and certainly not surprised, with the selection. 
Podhurst and Josephsberg are no strangers to nearly the entire Epstein defense team including Guy Lewis, Lili Ann 
Sanchez, Roy Black, and, apparently, Professor Dershowitz who said he knew Mr. Josephsberg from law school. Second, 
Podhurst and Josephsberg have long-standing stellar reputations for their legal acumen and ethics. It's hard for me to 
imagine how much more vetting needs to be done. 
The United States has a statutory obligation (Justice for All Act of 2004) to notify the victims of the anticipated upcoming 
events and their rights associated with the agreement entered into by the United States and Mr. Epstein in a timely fashion. 
Tomorrow will make one full week since you were formally notified of the selection. I must insist that the vetting process 
come to an end. Therefore, unless you provide me with a good faith objection to Judge Davis's selection by COB 
tomorrow, November 28, 2007, I will authorize the notification of the victims. Should you give me the go-ahead on Podhurst 
and Josephsberg selection by COB tomorrow, I will simultaneously send you a draft of the letter. I intend to notify the 
victims by letter after COB Thursday, November 29th. Thanks,

I have only gotten through page 1. FYI — I called Ms. 
attorney (who is paid for by Epstein) and asked 
one thing only — Do you still represent Ms. 
and do you want me to send the victim notification letter to 
you or to her? He asked me to send it to him. He asked what the letter would say and I would not tell him. I 
only said that we anticipated sending out the letter in the next week or so.

Dear 
I was just informed that a case disposition conference has been set in the Epstein case on 
January 7, 2008. Our agreement with Mr. Epstein contemplated a simultaneous plea and 
sentencing for October (or as we later agreed, November), followed by Mr. Epstein sell 
surrendering to begin serving his sentence not later than January 4, 2008. From your last e-
EFTA00013766
--- PAGE 2 ---
mail, it appeared that the judge was under the impression that Mr. Epstein could not be 
sentenced before January 2008. We are hoping that Judge McSorley would consider 
conducting the simultaneous plea and sentencing some time before January 4, 2008, so that 
Mr Epstein can comply with the terms of our agreement and begin serving his sentence on 
January 4, 2008. 
I also would appreciate it if you could send me a copy of the plea agreement, the Information 
that you plan to file (f it hasn't been filed already), and any factual proffer or other documents 
related to the plea. Please also let me know the date and time of the plea and sentencing so 
that someone firm our office can attend and insure Mr. Epsteinl• compliance with the terms of 
his federal non prosecution agreement. 
If you need any information regarding the federal investigation, or (fyou have any questions 
about the terms of the federal non-prosecution agreement, please do not hesitate to contact me 
at the number below or 
in the West Palm Beach office.

Good evening. I am the ASA with the Epstein case in Palm Beach County. The negotiated 
settlement is a definite go. A difficulty arose last week at a conference with the judge on the 
case. She wants the plea and sentence to occur concurrently; not a plea with a sentencing at a 
later date. Therefore, the case was set for the first week of January, but the plea and sentence 
will definitely occur before the January 4th date that was agreed on by all for the sentencing. 
If you have any questions, please contact me at

Ignorance of age not valid defense in sex cases, 
expert says 
By Larry Keller 
Palm Beach Post Staff Writer 
Friday, August 04, 2006 
Cara PRINTTH IS 
Even if Palm Beach money manager Jeffrey Epstein didn't know that girls who 
police say gave him sexual massages at his Intracoastal home were under the legal 
age, that alone wouldn't have exempted him from criminal charges of sexual activity 
with minors.

"Ignorance is not a valid defense," said Bob Dekle, a legal skills professor who was a Lake City 
prosecutor for nearly 30 years, half of that time specializing in sex crimes against children. 
Jeffrey Epstein 
-- 
Billionaire
financier 
Jeffrey 
Epstein has 
been indicted 
for felony solicitation of 
prostitution by a grand 
jury following 
accusations by teen girls.

"There is no knowledge element as far as 
the age is concerned," Dekle said. 
After an 11-month investigation, Palm 
Beach police said there was probable cause 
to charge Epstein, 53, with unlawful sex 
acts with a minor and lewd and lascivious 
molestation. They contend that Epstein —
friend of the rich and famous and financial 
patron of Democratic Party organizations 
and candidates — committed those acts 
with five underage girls. 
In the past week, New York Attorney 
General and gubernatorial candidate Eliot 
Spitzer has returned about $50,000 in 
campaign contributions he received from 
Epstein, and Mark Green, a candidate to 
replace Spitzer in his current job, has 
returned $10,000 to him because of the 
Palm Beach scandal, the New York Daily 
News has reported.

Latest breaking news, photos and all of today's Post stories. Rather than file charges, the state attorney's 
Share This Story 
office presented the case to a county grand 
jury. The panel indicted Epstein last week 
on a single, less serious charge of felony solicitation of prostitution. 
The case raised eyebrows because the state attorney's office rarely, if ever, kicks such charges to a grand 
jury. And it increases the difficulty of prosecuting child sex abuse cases, especially when the defendant 
is enormously wealthy and can hire high-priced, top-tier lawyers. 
At least one of Epstein's alleged victims told police he knew she was underage when the two of them got 
naked for massages and sexual activity. She was 16 years old at the time and said Epstein asked her 
questions about her high school, according to police reports. 
A girl who said she met Epstein when she was 15 said he told her if she told anybody what happened at 
his house, bad things could happen, the police reports state. 
Epstein's youngest alleged victim was 14 when she says she gave him a massage that included some 
sexual activity. She is now 16. The girl's father says he doesn't know whether she told Epstein her age. 
"My daughter has kept a lot of what happened from me because of sheer embarrassment," he said. "But 
she very much looked 14. Any prudent man would have had second thoughts about that." 
Defense attorney Jack Goldberger maintains that not only did Epstein pass a polygraph test showing he 
did not know the girls were minors, but their stories weren't credible. The state attorney's office also 
implied that their credibility was an issue when it decided not to charge Epstein directly, but instead give 
the case to the grand jury. 
"A prosecutor has to look at it in a much broader fashion," a state attorney's spokesman said last week. 
Epstein hired Harvard law Professor Alan Dershowitz when he became aware he was under 
investigation, and Dershowitz gave prosecutors information that some of the alleged victims had spoke 
of using alcohol and marijuana on a popular Web site, according to a Palm Beach police report. 
Prosecutors typically consider two things in deciding whether to charge somebody with sex-related 
offenses against minors — whether there is sufficient evidence and whether there is a public interest in 
doing so, Dekle said. 
If two teens are in a sexual relationship and the boy turns 18 before the girl, he could be charged with a 
sex crime if the sex continues. There would be no public interest in pursuing that, Dekle said. 
But where there is a large gap in ages — and especially in cases of teachers with students — there is a 
public interest in prosecuting, he said. Likewise if the accused has a track record of sex with minors. 
Still there is a "universal constant" in prosecuting these cases, Dekle said. Men who exploit underage 
children for sex often carefully choose their victims in ways that will minimize the risk to them, he said. 
Victims usually are from a lower social status, and they may suffer from psychological problems, Dekle 
said. 
"Lots of child sexual abuse victims have been victimized by multiple people over a period of time. Then 
http://palmbeachpost.printthis.clickability.corn/pt/cpt?action=cpt&title=Ignorance+of+age+... 1/2/2008 
EFTA00013770
--- PAGE 3 ---
Ignorance of age not valid defense in sex cases, expert says 
Page 3 of 3 
the act of abuse produces behavior in the victims that further damages their credibility." Examples 
include promiscuous behavior and drug abuse. 
Some of the alleged victims in the Epstein case returned to his home multiple times for the massage 
sessions and the $200 to $300 he typically paid them per visit. "That would be a definite problem for the 
prosecutor," said Betty Resch, who prosecuted crimes against children in Palm Beach County for five 
years and now is in private practice in Lake Worth. 
"The victim becomes less sympathetic" to a jury, Resch said. "But she's a victim nevertheless. She's a 
kid." 
Most men charged with sex crimes against minors look normal, Dekle said. A jury expecting to see a 
monster seldom will. And the victims' ages work against them and in favor of the defendant in a trial, 
Dekle said. 
If a child and an adult tell different stories and both swear they're telling the truth, adult jurors are more 
likely to believe the adult, Dekle said. 
"You have all these things working against you in a child sex abuse case. Prosecutors normally try to be 
very careful in filing those cases because they know what they're getting into. There is no such thing as 
an iron-clad child sexual abuse case."

Epstein's case is unusual in that suspected 
prostitution johns are usually charged with 
a misdemeanor, and even a felony charge is 
typically made in a criminal information —
an alternative to an indictment charging a 
person with the commission of a crime. 
His attorney, Jack Goldberger, declined to 
discuss the charge. 
State attorney's office spokesman Mike 
Edmondson also had little to say. 
"Generally speaking, there is a case that has 
a number of different aspects to it," 
Edmondson said of a prostitution-related 
charge being submitted to a grand jury. 
"We first became aware of the case months 
ago by Palm Beach police."

Share This Story 
Palm Beach police confirmed that and said 
the department will release a report today regarding its investigation. 
Epstein has owned a five-bedroom, 7 1/2 -bath, 7,234-square-foot home with a pool and a boat dock on 
the Intracoastal Waterway since 1990, according to property records. A man answering the door there 
Monday said that Epstein wasn't home. A Cadillac Escalade registered to him was parked in the 
driveway, which is flanked by two massive gargoyles. 
Epstein sued Property Appraiser Gary Nikolits in 2001, contending that the assessment of his home 
exceeded its fair market value. He dismissed his lawsuit in December 2002. 
A profile of Epstein in Vanity Fair magazine said he owns what are believed to be the largest private 
homes in Manhattan — 51,000 square feet — and in New Mexico — a 7,500-acre ranch. Those are in 
addition to his 70-acre island in the U.S. Virgin Islands and fleet of aircraft. 
Epstein's friends and admirers, according to the magazine, include prominent businessmen, academics 
and scientists and famed Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz.

Hi 
and Alex — We just finished interviewing three of the girls. I wish you could have been there to see how 
much this has affected them. 
One girl broke down sobbing so that we had to stop the interview twice within a 20 minute span. She regained 
her composure enough to continue a short time, but she said that she was having nightmares about Epstein 
coming after her and she started to break down again, so we stopped the interview. 
The second girl, who has a baby girl of her own, told us that she was very upset about the 18 month deal she had 
read about in the paper. She said that 18 months was nothing and that she had heard that the girls could get 
restitution, but she would rather not get any money and have Epstein spend a significant time in jail. 
The FBI's victim-witness coordinator attended and she has arranged for counseling for several of the girls. 
Please reach out to 
to make her decision. These girls deserve so much better than they have received so 
far, and I hate feeling that there is nothing I can do to help them. 
We have four more girls coming in tomorrow. Can I persuade you to attend?

Palm Beach billionaire faces second sex-assault lawsuit 
By Nancy °then 
Sun-Sentinel.com 
12:01 PM EST, February 6, 2008 
Billionaire and part-time Palm Beach resident Jeffrey Epstein was sued for the second time in less than two 
weeks Wednesday, this time by another teenager who claims she was sexually abused at his mansion. 
The 16-year-old Virginia girl is represented by the same attorney who filed a $50 million federal lawsuit in late 
January against Epstein, 55. This lawsuit seeks similar damages for an alleged sexual assault and intentional 
infliction of emotional distress. 
Jeffrey Herman, the teen's attorney, is planning a news conference in West Palm Beach this afternoon to discuss 
the allegations. 
EFTA00013776
--- PAGE 2 ---
Epstein, arrested in 2006 on a felony charge of solicitation of prostitution, is scheduled to appear in court next 
month for a status hearing. The New York resident is accused of luring young girls to his mansion for massages 
that turned sexual. 
The lawsuit alleges that Epstein has a sexual preference and "obsession for underage minor girls" and sought to 
gain access to economically disadvantaged younger girls in his home for paid massages. 
The 16-year-old girl, identified in the lawsuit as "Jane Doe No. 2," has suffered traumatic injuries, according to 
the complaint. 
When the first lawsuit was filed Epstein's attorneys said Epstein never had sex with the girl, who was 14 at the 
time, and that the lawsuit was motivated by greed.

I will need to look into that, but I do know that there is a 3-year statute of limitations on the state prostitution 
charges. That limitations period has already run for several of our victims (we have victims going back to 
2001). The girls who are charged in the state indictment saw him in February and September 2005. 
I will get the other info to you asap. Give me about 30 minutes.

state charges were dropped now, could they be dropped without prejudice? 
From: 
Son •

Subject: RE: Follow up 
Hi a- 
The state indictment is related to two girls. One of those girls is included in the federal 
indictment, the other is not. The state indictment charges solicitation of adult prostitution, it does not charge any 
child exploitation offense, despite the fact that, under Florida law, neither lack of knowledge of age nor 
affirmative misrepresentation of age by the victim is a defense. 
The victim from the state case who is referenced in the federal indictment told Epstein her true age and 
he engaged in full sexual intercourse with her a few days shy of her 18th birthday. For that birthday, he gave her 
a series of gifts, including lingerie. The other 18 girls named in the current indictment are not part of the state 
indictment. 
The state case currently has a trial date set for July. Before we got involved, the police were told that 
Epstein was going to plead to a misdemeanor and get no jail time. (That is one of the reasons why they asked 
the FBI to step in.) Since the federal investigation began, Epstein's counsel have continued the case repeatedly 
EFTA00013778
--- PAGE 2 ---
on the basis that they cannot resolve that case until the federal case is resolved. As part of the non-prosecution 
agreement that the Office put together with Epstein, the federal case was supposed to be resolved if Epstein 
agreed to three main terms: (1) he had to plead to a state offense for which sex offender registration was 
required, specifically, the procurement of minors to engage in prostitution; (2) he had to agree to an 18-month 
term of incarceration; and (3) he had to agree to pay restitution and damages to the victims. After the agreement 
was signed, he then tried to escape all three requirements. 
He objected to pleading to the state charge, claiming that the facts did not apply, and asked to plead to a 
non-registrable offense instead. When we responded that there were four other registrable offenses where the 
facts certainly fit, those were rejected because (1) they required registration and (2) the state sentencing 
guidelines for those offenses were too high. 
He tried to arrange to get out on work release, which would allow him to "work" anywhere he liked 
during the day and sleep in a halfway house, rather than a jail, at night. When he learned that sex offenders 
weren't allowed to be a part of the work release program, he started complaining about the jail time. He now 
wants to get a "suspended sentence" and/or home confinement, instead. 
He complained that he should be able to fully litigate the issues of liability and damages with regard to 
the third term of the agreement, despite his agreement directly to the contrary. 
With respect to the current status of the state case, other than the new trial date, all that I know is that 
Epstein is now subpoenaing victims for depositions who are not included in the state indictment. (Under Florida 
law, defense counsel are allowed to depose witnesses, including victims, prior to trial.) He seems to be trying to 
use that process to get information about the federal investigation. I do not know whether Epstein's 
misdemeanor deal is back on the table because the defense demanded that we have no contact with the State 
Attorney's Office, so I haven't spoken with the ASA in over 6 months. 
I wish I had more information to give you. If you would like me to reach out to either the local detective 
on the state case or the Assistant State Attorney, please let me know. Or, if you would like their contact info, I 
can forward that to you, too. 
Thank you. I will be back in the office tomorrow and you can call me there with any other questions.

WRITERS DIRECT DWI 
Gmvil 
I write to offer my reaction to the May 15, 2008 correspondence from the United States 
Department of Justice Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section ("CEOS") regarding the federal 
investigation of Jeffrey Epstein by the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of 
Florida ("USAO"),I I will refrain from recounting Mr. Epstein's arguments in detail here, but, 
rather, will highlight salient points responsive to the CEOS letter. 
In particular, I write from a background well familiar with child exploitation cases and 
victim/witness issues. As the CEOS letter points out (CEOS letter at p. 3), I was a member of 
CEOS. In fact, I served as a federal prosecutor for twelve years; five years as an Assistant United 
States Attorney for the Southern District of West Virginia, and seven years at CEOS. I began 
working as a trial attorney for CEOS in 1999, and was promoted to Deputy Chief for Litigation in 
2002, and ultimately to Principal Deputy Chief for the Section in 2004. 
As those who have worked with me know, I have a history of working diligently on behalf of 
victims of crime. While at the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of West 
Virginia, I was a part of the prosecution team that prosecuted the first case in the country under the 
federal Violence Against Women Act. United States v. Bailey, 112 F.3d 758 (41 Cir.), cert denied, 
522 U.S. 896 (1997). The case went to trial and the defendant was sentenced to life in prison. I also 
spearheaded the domestic violence and federal criminal child support prosecution efforts for that 
office, prosecuting some of the first cases in the country under the federal Child Support Recovery 
Citations to the May 15, 2008 correspondence will be referenced herein as "CEOS letter at p. 
."

Act. Later, while at the Department of Justice, I co-authored the Department's Federal Child 
Support Prosecution Handbook. 
My work at CEOS permitted me to continue my efforts on behalf of vulnerable victims of 
crime. While there, for example, I was part of the prosecution team in United States v. Dwight York, 
428 F.3d 1325 (11th Cir. 2005), cert denied, 548 U.S. 908 (2006). York was the leader of a pseudo 
religious organization, and systematically molested countless children, some as young as six years 
old. The case went to trial and York was sentenced to 135 years in prison. As part of that trial team, 
I was awarded the Attorney General's Award for Distinguished Service. Additionally, at CEOS I 
was one of the architects of the Innocence Lost Initiative, a nationwide initiative designed to combat 
child prostitution. For this, I was awarded an Assistant Attorney General's Award for Outstanding 
Victim/Witness Service. Likewise, I was awarded a subsequent Assistant Attorney General's Award 
for Special Initiative in connection with a nationwide sex tourism prosecution initiative I helped to 
develop. 
I say all this not for any boastful purpose, but, rather, to make clear that I am fully cognizant 
of victim issues, and that I am no pushover in terms of prosecution standards. I am also very well 
aware of the good work of CEOS, and the outstanding credentials of those who toil in that office. 
With all due respect to CEOS, however (and recognizing that their review of this case was 
quite limited), given the facts and circumstances of this investigation, a federal prosecution of Mr. 
Epstein simply should not be countenanced. In my view, such prosecution would be counter to the 
important mandate of the Department of Justice as emblazoned on its seal, "Qui Pro Domina Justitia 
Sequitur," referring to the Attorney General "who prosecutes on behalf of justice." 
As you well know, it is fundamental to that mandate that, as the representative of the people 
of the United States, the duty of a federal prosecutor is not simply to seek conviction as at any cost, 
but, rather, to seek justice. Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 88 (1935). ("The United States 
Attorney is the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose 
obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all.") While it is true 
that Berger was decided at the post-trial, as opposed to the pre-indictment, stage of the case, the 
bedrock principle contained in the above quote should transcend the entire investigation and 
prosecution process. Indeed, it is arguably most imperative at the investigation stage, at which point 
law enforcement is dealing with a presumptively innocent citizen. 
In summary, we understand the allegations against Mr. Epstein to be that Mr. Epstein paid 
individuals to find friends and acquaintances, certain of whom were under the age of 18, to provide 
topless massages to him at his Palm Beach home in exchange for money. Mr. Epstein's assistants 
allegedly scheduled these massages for him over the telephone at the direction of Mr. Epstein, 
allegedly including some scheduling calls to underage women. However, the evidence contradicts 
these allegations. First, Mr. Epstein did not ask that the masseuses be under the age of 18. To the 
contrary, he specifically asked that they be 18 or older. As one witness commented, 
said tell 
EFTA00013786

them you're 18 because if you're not, he won't let you in his house." 
Tr. at 38-39. 
Second, Mr. Epstein himself did not schedule such appointments. Third, Mr. Epstein would not 
know who would be providing a massage at any particular time. Fourth, and importantly, Mr. 
Epstein's assistants were not directed to contact underage women, and were not aware of the true 
ages of the women they contacted. In fact, more often than not, the masseuses themselves, or the 
individuals who introduced the masseuses, made the initial contact. As a result, Mr. Epstein and his 
assistants were routinely unaware of the identities of many of these young women before they 
arrived. 
The allegations further include the assertion that Mr. Epstein engaged in unlawful sexual 
conduct with certain underage women who arrived at his house to provide a massage. At times, 
during these massages, Mr. Epstein masturbated, engaged in some sexual touching, and a small 
number of alleged acts of penetration. However, most of the women who performed massages on 
Mr. Epstein were over the age of 18. Many of the young women have sworn under oath that they, in 
fact, told Mr. Epstein that they were 18 or older, and that they did so because they knew that if they 
were not 18 years old, they would not be allowed into Mr. Epstein's home. In fact, Mr. Epstein has 
passed a polygra h examination to this effect relative to the government's primary, and youngest, 
alleged victim 
. Indeed, many of the women also worked at local massage parlors, 
which presumably had a requirement that the masseuse have reached the age of majority. To the 
extent there are allegations that Mr. Epstein should have been alerted to certain underage women 
based on conversations he allegedly had with them, those conversations would have taken place in 
person and at his home, thereby precluding any prior scheduling with knowledge of their true ages. 
As explained below, any factual allegations of repeat massages with such persons would lack 
necessary elements required for a federal nexus to such conduct. 
All of the alleged activity occurred in Mr. Epstein's home in Palm Beach, Florida. Many of 
the massages allegedly involved conduct which, even if engaged in, is not proscribed by federal law, 
either because the masseuses were of age, or because conduct with underage masseuses only 
involved topless massages, massages in undergarments or naked massages. To the extent prohibited 
sexual activity occurred, any inducement, enticement, and/or persuasion used would have taken 
place during a face-to-face encounter—thus eliminating the possibility for the commission of a 
federal crime, which requires the existence of a communication through a facility of interstate 
commerce in which the defendant persuades or entices the minor to engage in illegal sexual activity. 
Furthermore, any prohibited sexual activity that did occur based on the facts on the record is best left 
to the state to address because the facts of this case do not fall comfortably within the federal 
domain. 
This is a case about purely local activity, involving local actors, and affecting local 
interests and thus, should be handled by local authorities. Nonetheless, the USAO has indicated 
its intent to prosecute Mr. Epstein for purported violations of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422, 2423, and 
1591. However, as set forth in detail in prior submissions, the facts of this case fall squarely 
outside the heartland of those statutes - in fact, in law, and in congressional intent. As their plain 
EFTA00013787

ALLEN GUTHRIE MCHUGH & THONIAS, PLLC 
Mr. John Roth 
June 19, 2008 
Page 4 
text and history indicate, these statutes were designed to address problems that are truly national 
and international in scope: human trafficking in § 1591; telephone or Internet sexual predation in 
§ 2422; and sex tourism in § 2423. Unlike the alleged conduct at issue here, those problems 
unquestionably present multi-jurisdictional obstacles that States and localities cannot confront 
effectively on their own. Mr. Epstein's conduct was purely local in nature, and the State of 
Florida and Palm Beach County are effectively prosecuting and punishing that conduct. 
Although CEOS asserts, "that a prosecution of Mr. Epstein might not look precisely like the 
cases that came before it is not dispositive" (CEOS letter at p. 4), the fact is this case does not look 
anything like those cases. The facts here do not carry any of the hallmarks that typify an appropriate 
federal prosecution for child exploitation as reflected in all such prior federal prosecutions. 
Specifically, the facts here do not carry the hallmarks for a sex trafficking or child prostitution 
prosecution. Mr. Epstein did not target minors. In fact, the evidence indicates just the opposite. 
There was no travel in interstate commerce for the purpose of engaging in illicit sexual activity. 
There was no prohibited use of a facility of interstate commerce. There was no commercial for profit 
sexual enterprise. There was no force. There was no violence. There was no use of drugs or 
alcohol. There was no child pornography. 
U.S.C. § 1591 is clearly designed to combat organized rings of individuals who engage in 
the business of human trafficking, involving both a commercial and coercive component. As 
President Bush has noted: 
generally speaking, trafficking in persons refers to actions, often including the use of 
force, fraud or coercion, to compel someone into a situation in which he or she will 
be exploited for sexual purposes, which could include prostitution or pornography, or 
for labor without compensation, which could include forced or bonded labor . . . 
trafficking in persons is often linked to organized crime, and the profits from 
trafficking enterprises help fund other illegal activities. The growth of vast 
transnational criminal networks supported in part by trafficking in persons fosters 
official corruption and threatens the rule of law.2
This in no way describes the case here. Yet the USAO has been unwavering in its single 
minded focus to stretch the limits of these federal statutes beyond their intended use, and beyond 
precedent, in order to prosecute Mr. Epstein. As the CEOS letter acknowledges, the legal theories 
the USAO intends to attempt to pursue against Mr. Epstein are "novel," having never before been 
sanctioned by federal law. They should not be sanctioned now. As the Supreme Court recently 
pronounced, when a statutory term in a criminal statute could support both a narrow or broad 
application of the federal criminal law, "the tie must go to the defendant." United States v. Santos, 
553 U.S. 
and Cuellar v. United States, 553 U.S 
(June 2, 2008), Slip Op. at 6.

A MI and fair review of the facts here is critical to this analysis. Yet, it is clear that CEOS 
did not conduct such a review. In his recent letter to Jay Lelkowitz, First Assistant United States 
Attorney ("FAUSA") 
confirmed our understanding that the USAO was to have 
"facilitated" an "independent de novo review of the investigation" by the Department. (May 19, 
2008 Sloman letter at p. 5). Yet, the CEOS review was not complete, and by its own terms not de 
novo. 
As CEOS itself noted, "our review of this case is limited both factually and legally. We have 
not looked at the entire universe of facts in this case. It is not the role of the Criminal Division to 
conduct a complete factual inquiry from scratch." (CEOS letter at p. 1). Indeed, entire subject areas 
relevant to the inquiry were not considered at all by CEOS. In essence, CEOS was only in a position 
to make the most cursory possible review, an "abuse of discretion" review, without considering the 
facts at the necessary level of detail, and without taking into account the many and varied issues of 
misconduct we have raised in this case. As the CEOS letter indicates, "we did not review the facts, 
circumstances, or terms included in the plea offer nor any allegations that individuals involved in the 
investigation engaged in misconduct." (CEOS letter at p. 2). All of this begs the question — if it is 
not CEOS' role to "conduct a complete factual inquiry," and CEOS did not consider any of the 
allegations of misconduct here, which at the very least have created a strong appearance of 
impropriety, and, at worst evidence an intent and effort to unfairly prejudice Mr. Epstein to the 
financial benefit of the friends and colleagues of the prosecution team in the USAO, then where and 
when can justice ever hope to be served in this case? This is a prosecution burden that cannot, and 
should not, be brushed aside. 
We contend the limited nature of the CEOS review deeply affected its conclusions. For 
example, CEOS most likely did not review original documents, such as transcripts, and instead relied 
on the summaries of federal prosecutors and FBI agents, against whom we have raised serious 
concerns regarding misconduct. If the summary memos from the USAO are as flawed as other 
USAO communications have been, and which we have been able to show are misleading and 
inaccurate, the CEOS abuse of discretion review is likely flawed as well. Moreover although the 
USAO expected, and personally promised to us, an independent review, FAUSA 
letter also 
makes clear that our pivotal legal challenge to the use of 18 U.S.C. § 2422(b) had already "been 
previously raised and thoroughly considered and rejected by ... CEOS prior to" the recent CEOS 
review. (May 19, 2008 Sloman letter at p. 5). The fact that CEOS had to evaluate its own decision 
with respect to some of the allegations against Mr. Epstein prevents its subsequent review and 
opinion from being truly independent. 
Following this most recent CEOS review "limited both factually and legally," and with no 
citation to any case law relative to the statutes in question, CEOS concludes merely, "federal 
prosecution in this case would not be improper or inappropriate (CEOS letter at p. 5);" in essence, 
that the United States Attorney could bring this case in the exercise of his federal discretion should 
he so choose ("we conclude that U.S. Attorney Acosta could properly use his discretion to authorize 
prosecution in this case."). (CEOS letter at p. 2). However, CEOS drew the conclusion that the 
EFTA00013789
--- PAGE 6 ---
ALLEN GUTHRIE MCRUGH & THOMAS, PLLC 
Mr. John Roth 
June 19, 2008 
Page 6 
federal prosecution of Mr. Epstein would not be "improper or inappropriate" absent any review at all 
of the misconduct here, and absent a full review of the facts and law. The facts, the law, and the 
alleged misconduct are each necessarily inextricably intertwined with the question of whether or not 
this is a viable federal prosecution. These imposed limits flawed the review from the outset. In any 
event, CEOS concedes that the defense team makes "many compelling arguments." (CEOS letter at 
p. 5). In the end, then, one is left with the impression that the CEOS review and opinion, although 
concluding that the USAO could push forward at its own discretion, is a much qualified one. 
The federal prosecution of Mr. Epstein has been a moving target from the inception. Each 
time the allegations, the witnesses or the applicable law is subject to a searching inquiry, we have 
found that the allegations have been misrepresented, the law does not apply to the actual facts here, 
and the USAO prosecution theory falls apart. Yet, in the face of the voluminous evidence we have 
submitted in this regard, while acknowledging that the theories are "novel," and that our arguments 
against federal prosecution are "compelling," CEOS concluded, "Mr. Acosta could rightfully 
conclude that this federal issue is best resolved by a jury" and that "the USAO has a good faith basis 
to fully develop the facts on this issue and brief the law to permit a court to decide whether the law 
appropriately reaches such conduct." With all due respect, and recognizing that CEOS may be —and 
apparently was — limited in its authority, it should not be the prerogative of the prosecution arm of 
the United States government to simply roll the dice, and let the court system just sort it out when 
dealing with the life and liberty of a United States citizen. The Department of Justice should not be 
so cavalier when labeling someone as a child molester. While it may be within the discretion of the 
USAO to do so, it is not in accord with the principles of justice. 
Indeed, as noted, just a few weeks ago, the Supreme Court underscored this point in Santos 
and Cuellar. The Court made clear that prosecutorial discretion does not provide the USAO cart 
blanche to expand criminal statutes as they seek to do here with complete disregard for congressional 
intent. The Court rejected speculation as a basis of determining the scope of a criminal statute; 
"probability is not a guide which a court, in construing a penal statute, can safely take." Slip op. at 7, 
quoting United States v. Wiltberger, 5 Wheat. 76,105 (1820). "We interpret ambiguous criminal 
statutes in favor of defendants, not prosecutors." Slip op. at 12. 
Based on my experience, I believe that the facts here do not warrant a federal child 
exploitation prosecution. At its core, this case is quintessentially a state concern as opposed to 
implicating any federal interest. Indeed, the Florida State Attorney's Office ("SAO"), led by the 
chief of the Sex Crimes Division, thoroughly investigated this matter, and presented it to the grand 
jury. The facts, as opposed to the deeply flawed press reports, were carefully assessed by 
experienced State prosecutors who aggressively enforce State criminal laws. Following an extensive 
15-month State investigation, Mr. Epstein was indicted by a State grand jury on a single felony count 
of solicitation of prostitution. 
During the investigation, the State prosecutor exhaustively reviewed the evidence, met face-
to-face with many of the alleged victims, considered their credibility — or lack thereof — and 
EFTA00013790
--- PAGE 7 ---
ALLEN GUTHRIE MCHUGH & 'THOMAS, PLLC 
Mr. John Roth 
June 19, 2008 
Page 7 
considered the extent of exculpatory evidence, including a psychosexual evaluation of Mr. Epstein 
and a polygraph examination demonstrating that Mat 
genuinely believed at the time of the 
alleged conduct that the State's key witness (= 
was over the age of 18. Then, after 
months of negotiations, the State reached what it believed was an appropriate resolution of the case. 
Importantly, this resolution was consistent with that of cases involving other defendants who had 
engaged in similar conduct. Implementation of the State resolution of the case was held in abeyance, 
however, due to the unexpected commencement of the successive federal criminal investigation. 
While it is true, as CEOS points out, (CEOS letter at p. 3) that many criminal prosecutions 
turn on issues of credibility of witnesses, to which many members of the defense team can attest 
(having had decades of federal criminal litigation experience among us), this does not serve to divest 
the prosecutor of his/her duty to make a searching inquiry of the facts before using the power of 
prosecution, and the weight of the United States government, to level serious accusations. CEOS 
likewise acknowledges as much, "the prosecutors are in the best position to assess the witnesses' 
credibility." (CEOS letter at p. 3). 
Since the CEOS letter also singles me out as someone who should be familiar with witness 
issues, I feel compelled to note that, of course, I am well aware that it is not uncommon for witnesses 
to give conflicting statements. I am also fully aware that the credibility of key government witnesses 
may be strongly impacted by the $50 million incentive provided via the civil lawsuits at play, and 
encouraged by the government here. 3 I have also read many of the conflicts between witness 
testimony and Detective 
own rendition of that testimony in his reports and/or search 
warrant affidavit. Detective 
apparently formed a view early on as to the purported 
criminality of Mr. Epstein's conduct regardless of the mountain of evidence to the contrary. For a 
prosecutor that has had an opportunity to review the full facts, and to meet with the witnesses, 
however, "conflicting statements" cross the line to a "lack of credibility" that simply can not sustain 
a prosecution. That is where an appropriate application of prosecutorial discretion must be brought 
to bear. 
Again, CEOS was not itself in the position to exercise such discretion. By its own admission, 
CEOS did not make a full review of the witness statements here, and CEOS certainly did not sit 
down across the table and speak to these witnesses. We understand that was apparently not its 
perceived role. But, CEOS should recognize that at least one prosecutor in this case — the Chief of 
the SAO Sex Crimes Division has done so. Lana Belohlavek not only met with and interviewed 
these witnesses during the course of the 15-month state investigation prior to any federal 
involvement, but she again sat across the table from many of them in connection with recent civil 
rather, upon the complaint 
ation waton 
the complaint of an alleged victim, but, 
father, 
and her stepmother 
. More 
It is important to note here 
notable still is the fact that 
has been convicted of federal bank fraud, and 
has a state 
conviction for identify fraud. Hardly pillars ofill. 
Yet, the USAO did not supply this information to the 
defense. Even more telling is the fact that Mr. 
filed a $50million lawsuit purportedly on behalf of his 
daughter without her authority or knowledge.

depositions in this matter. Ms. Belohlavek, and the SAO, is likewise well familiar with the breadth 
of the federal investigation, and has integrated that knowledge into the current enhanced state 
sentencing recommendation. The SAO remains firm in the position that the proposed state resolution 
is a sound one, and that there was no child exploitation here. Notably, however, not once during the 
pendency of the federal investigation has the USAO ever reached out to its state prosecutive 
counterpart that initiated this investigation in the first place to discuss the issues or to thoroughly 
ferret out the facts or the witness credibility issues. 
In the eight lines the CEOS letter accords to the topic of witness credibility CEOS asserts, 
"there are multiple mutually-corroborating witnesses," (CEOS letter at p. 3). However, the CEOS 
letter does not highlight a single one. In contrast, we have put forth numerous "mutually 
corroborating" witness statements. Far from supporting a federal prosecution, these statements 
instead corroborate that I) the alleged victims lied to Mr. Epstein about their age; 2) there was no use 
of a facility of interstate commerce by Mr. Epstein; 3) there was no inducement or coercion; 4) there 
was no commercial enterprise; and 5) there was no illicit sexual conduct. 
Indeed, Mr. Epstein took several steps to ensure that no minors entered his
,
 home most 
notably, by affirmatively asking the women whether they were actually 18. See e.g. 
Tr. At 
38-39. That fact — which many of the potential witnesses have confirmed in sworn interviews —
strongly indicates that Mr. Epstein specifically intended to preclude an one under 18 from giving 
him a massage. That fact is confirmed by, among other things, 
testimony that "he 
likes the girls that are between the ages of like 18 and 20 . . . ." 
Tr. at 12. In fact, the 
evidence bears out that the majority of the women who came to Mr. Epstein's residence to provide a 
massage were over 18. 
Many of the young women who were aged 16 and 17 visited Mr. Epstein's residence only 
once or twice, and the evidence strongl shows that the lied to Mr. Epstein about their age. Two of 
these individuals, 
and 
, were 14 and 15 at the time the met Mr. 
Epstein. Given that each has brought a civil lawsuit against Mr. Epstein, with Ms. 
and her 
family seeking $50 million from Mr. Epstein, their testimony against Mr. Epstein is per se suspect. 
But, despite their obvious incentive to halm Mr. Epstein, their testimony actually confirms his 
innocence. Ms. 
, for instance, has testified that Ms. =, 
who introduced her to Mr. 
Epstein, expressly told her to lie to Mr. Epstein about her age. 
Q: 
And 
told you that if you weren't 18 Epstein wouldn't let you into his house, 
right? 
A: 
That's — yes, yes. 
Tr. (deposition) at 32. 
Q: 
You didn't want Mr. Epstein to know that you were lying about your age, right?

A: 
Correct. 
Q: 
You didn't want Mr. Epstein to know that you were not 18 yet, right? 
A: 
Correct. 
Tr. (deposition) at 36. 
In fact, Ms. 
told Mr. Epstein that she was 18 years old, and confirmed this fact with 
Palm Beach Police. M. at 36. Beyond that, Ms. 
"swore on her mother's grave" that she 
and Mr. Epstein did not engage in sex of any kind. 
Tr. (deposition) at 24. She further 
repeatedly explained that prior to the time she went to Mr. Epstein's house (she went there only 
once), nobody ever tried to coerce her to en a e m sexual activity with Mr. Epstein. Not over the 
telephone, not over the Internet, not at all. 
Tr. (deposition) at 31-32. These are not facts 
upon which a federal case can stand. 
Ms. 
age was also unknown to Mr. E stein when she went to his home. 
who was introduced to Mr. Epstein by Ms. 
, testified in her federal sworn interview 
that Ms. 
told her to lie to Epstein. agc 
Tr. at 8 ("she just said make sure you're 18 
because Jeffrey doesn't want an underage girls') (emphasis added). Ms. 
testimon 
strongly suggests that Ms. 
lied to Mr. Epstein about her own age as well. Ms. 
also self represented that she worked at a local erotic massage parlor that presumably required a 
minimum age. 
The conduct of 
is likewise illustrative of "mutually corroborating" testimony 
which 
ports the fact that this is not an appropriate federal case. In the same way that Ms. 
was referred to Mr. Elan 
and brought to his home without havin been introduced or 
acquainted in any manner, Ms. 
was referred by someone else, 
, who also told 
her to lie to Mr. Epstein about her age, which she did. t 
Tr. at pp. 8-9). 
CEOS seeks to buttress the USAO prosecution by asserting "it is possible to satisfy that 
element [proof of specific intent as to the age of the alleged victims] with proof that the defendant 
was deliberately ignorant of facts which would suggest that the person was a minor." (CEOS letter 
at p. 2). Such assertion is counter to the law and to the facts. Reliance on a deliberate ignorance 
standard as to any of the three statutes in issue requires the factual predicate of an intent n_qt to learn 
of an incriminating fact. This is the antithesis of the factual context of this case where there is 
repeated proof that the minors believed that they had to lie because Mr. Epstein had an actual 
practice of attempting to verify age, and would not let them in his house if they were under the age of 
18. ss& United States v. Kennard, 472 F.3d 851, 857-858 (I 1th Cir. 2006), quoting, United States v. 
Puche 350 F.3d 1137, 1149 (111° Cir. 2003) (An instruction on deliberate ignorance is appropriate 
only if it is shown [among other things] ... that the defendant purposely contrived to avoid learning 
EFTA00013793

ALLEN GUTHRIE MCHUGH & THOMAS, PLLC 
Mr. John Roth 
June 19, 2008 
Page 10 
of all of the facts in order to have a defense in the event of a subsequent prosecution."). Thus, the 
facts preclude reliance on the concept of deliberate ignorance as a substitute for proof. 
The fact that the search warrant affidavit in this case is rife with mis-statements and 
omissions regarding the key element of age is critical. However, CEOS concludes with no apparent 
supporting analysis, "despite the numerous factual errors you describe, the U.S. Attorney's Office 
could still plausibly argue that the mistakes —whether inadvertent or intentional — were not material 
to the determination . ..." (CEOS letter at p. 3). Although, as CEOS notes, there are "numerous" 
such misrepresentations, through affirmative statement or intentional omission, a focus on but one of 
those misrepresentations highlights that such misrepresentations were, in fact, material. The fact is 
that Detective 
grossly misrepresented Mr. Epstein's intent as it related to the age of the 
women he permitted entry to his residence. 
In the search warrant affidavit, Detective 
affirmed that 
claimed: 
[Mr. E stein told her the younger the better. 
And, 
stated she once tried to bring a 23 year old female and Epstein stated that the 
female was too old. 
What Detective M, 
no doubt intentionally, omitted was =s
 further explanation, 
which rendered Mr. Epstein's comments innocuous: 
A: 
Let me put it this way, he — I tried to bring him a woman who was 23 and he didn't 
really like it. 
Q: 
He didn't go for it? 
A: 
It's not that he didn't go for it. It's just that he didn't care for it. And he likes the 
girls that are between the ages of 18 and 20. (= 
Statement at 12) (emphasis 
added). 
Had that critical information, information that turns allegedly illegal conduct into more 
innocent conduct, been included, it would have seriously undermined the probable cause for the 
search warrant. 
Similarly, and equally problematic, Detective 
did not include the many statements 
demonstrating that, when asked by Mr. Epstein, the women affirmatively misrepresented their ages 
m1.1
18, and/or that Mr., 
was not aware of their true ages. Indeed, although Detective 
did note that Ms. 
told Mr. Epstein that she was 18, he omitted from the affidavit 
the key point as to why she lied: 
EFTA00013794
--- PAGE 11 ---
ALLEN GUTHRIE MCHUGH & THOMAS, PLLC 
Mr. John Roth 
June 19, 2008 
Page 11 
said tell him you're 18 because if you're not, he won't let you in his house. 
So I said I was 18. As I was giving him a massage, he was like how old are you. 
And then I was like 18. But I kind of said it really fast because I didn't want to make 
it sound like I was lying or anything. 
Tr. at 38-39. 
Thus, consistent with the guidance provided in Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978), the 
search warrant affidavit in this case reveals knowing and reckless falsehoods and omitted material 
information. This is precisely the type the United States Supreme Court sought to guard against. 
The age of the alleged victims, and of Mr. Epstein's intent in that regard, is an element of the 
crimes that must be proven in order to sustain a conviction. In particular, § 2422(b) requires that the 
defendant specifically intended to target a minor. age, a, United States v. Murrell, 368 F.3d 1286 
(11th Cir. 2004) ("[T]o prove an attempt the government must first prove that [defendant], using the 
intemet, acted with a specific intent to persuade, induce, entice, or coerce a minor to engage in 
unlawful sex.") (Emphasis added). Section 2422(b) expressly requires that the crime be committed 
"knowingly," and that requisite mental element applies as to each element of the crime. United 
States v. XCitement Video. Inc., 513 U.S. 64, 68-69 (1994); United States v. Meek, 366 F.3d 705, 
718 (9th Cir. 2004); United States v. Root, 296 F.3d 1222, 1227 (11th Cir. 2002); United States v. 
Bailey 228 F.3d 637, 638-639 (6ih Cir. 2000). How, then, could the USAO "plausibly argue" that a 
misrepresentation about an element of the crime could be viewed as "not material"? If the elements 
of the alleged crime are not met, there is no probable cause to sustain the search warrant in the first 
instance. If the elements are not met, there is no federal crime. That is material. 
Moreover, it is clear from the plaint text of the statute that the statutorily proscribed act 
pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §2422(b) is the actual use of a facility of interstate commerce to persuade, 
entice, induce, or coerce. "The underlying criminal conduct Congress expressly proscribed in passing 
§2422(b) is the persuasion, inducement, enticement, or coercion of the minor rather than the sex act 
itself. That is, if a person persuaded a minor to engage in sexual conduct (e.g., with himself or a third 
party) without then committing any sex act himself, he would nevertheless violate §2422(b)." United 
States v. Murrell, 368 F.3d 1283, 1286 (11th Cir. 2004). See also, United States v. Bailey, 228 F.3d 
637, 639 (6'h Cir. 2000) ("Congress has made a clear choice to criminalize persuasion and the 
attempt to persuade, not the performance of the sexual acts themselves."). Thus, if there has been 
sexual misconduct (which we deny) without the requisite persuasion, there is no violation of this 
federal law. 
The investigation and testimony in this case makes clear that Mr. Epstein did not use any 
facility of interstate commerce to commit any act forbidden by 18 U.S.C. § 2422(W—to persuade, 
induce entice coerce—nor did he direct any of his assistants to do so. Indeed, by way of example, 
was clear on this point at her deposition during which she repeatedly testified that 
nobody—not Mr. Epstein or any of his assistants—ever used the Internet or phone in any way to try 
to persuade her to engage in sexual activity with Mr. Epstein. 
Tr. (deposition) at 31-32. 
Nonetheless, even assuming, arguendo, that persuasion to engage in sexual conduct occurred over 
EFTA00013795
--- PAGE 12 ---
ALLEN GUTHRIE MCHUGH & THOMAS, PLLC 
Mr. John Roth 
June 19, 2008 
Page 12 
the telephone (which we deny), it is black letter law that the mens rea must coincide with the actus 
reus. Thus, the government must prove that Mr. Epstein has the specific intent to target a known 
minor to engage in prohibited sexual activity at the time of the call. We have seen zero evidence of 
this. To the extent Mr. Epstein later may have persuaded a particular individual to engage in 
unlawful sexual activity during a massage, such persuasion occurred face to face, and can not work 
retroactively to render the earlier phone call an offense under the statute. 
As to the purported violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2423 for allegedly traveling in interstate 
commerce for the purpose of engaging in illicit sexual activity, CEOS does not deny that Mr. Epstein 
was returning to one of his residences when he traveled to Florida.4 CEOS explicitly stated it "fully 
understand[s] our argument" (CEOS letter at p.2) that Mr. Epstein should not be charged under 
§ 2423(b) because the dominant purpose for his traveling to Palm Beach was not to engage in illegal 
sexual activity, but to simply return to one of his residences. Rather, this is apparently another 
"compelling" point of law which may be left to "a court to decide whether the law properly reaches 
such conduct." (CEOS letter at p. 2).5 Notably, implicit in this concession by CEOS is that the law 
has never before been so applied, that is, there is no precedent for a court to extend the statute as the 
USAO seeks to do here. In fact, the United States Supreme Court prohibited the criminalization of 
travel under identical circumstances over a half century ago. Sis, Mortenson v. United States 322 
U.S. 369, 374 (1944) (intention to engage in proscribed conduct must "exist before the conclusion of 
the interstate journey and must be the dominate motive of such interstate movement." (Emphasis 
added.) 
Beyond an absence of proof regarding the travel element in connection with 18 U.S.C. §2423, 
the requisite age requirement for a violation of that statute is important. 18 U.S.C. §2423, by 
reference to Chapter 109A (18 U.S.C. §2423(f)(1)), specifically defines a minor for purposes of that 
statute as an individual who has not attained the age of 16. If an alleged victim is 16 years of age or 
older, a violation of this statute pursuant to 2423(0(1) can only occur if it can be proven that force, 
threat or drugs were involved. $x,18 U.S.C. §§ 2241 et seq. There are no such allegations here. As 
a result, in order to find a violation under 18 U.S.C. § 2423, the United States would have to prove 
that Mr. Epstein engaged in one of the sexual acts defined at 18 U.S.C. § 2246(2) with an individual 
under the age of 16, and that he formed the intent and dominant purpose to ck
s
i
orior to the time he 
made a return trip to Florida. Again, there is no such evidence here. Ms. 
has specifically 
testified that 1) she never engaged in sexual activity with Mr. Epstein; 2) she never even met or 
talked to Mr. Epstein prior to her arrival at his house; and 3) she lied about her age not only to Mr. 
Epstein, but, in fact, to the world on her MySpace page when she said that she was 18 years old. It is, 
then, also worth noting in this regard that 18 U.S.C. §§2243(c) provides an affirmative defense if 
proven by a preponderance of the evidence if Mr. Epstein reasonably believed that Ms. 
was 
4In addition to his residence there, Mr. Epstein also has several businesses, and personal matters and contacts to which 
he attends in Florida. For example, beginning in 2002, Mr. Epstein visited his mother nearly every weekend in Palm 
Beach until she passed away in April, 2004. 
As previously set forth herein, and as more fully explained in other submissions related to this case, the recent 
Supreme Court decisions in Santo and Cuellar make this attempted stretch of the law improper. 
EFTA00013796
--- PAGE 13 ---
ALLEN GUTHRIE MCHUGH & THOMAS, PLLC 
Mr. John Roth 
June 19, 2008 
Page 13 
had attained the requisite legal age. Finally, although 18 U.S.C. §2423(f)(2) also defines "illicit 
sexual conduct" as any commercial sex act with a person under the age of 18, 18 U.S.C. §2423(g) 
also provides a specific affirmative defense as to that age element if proven by a preponderance of 
the evidence that Mr. Epstein reasonably believed that the young women had attained the requisite 
legal age. As we have demonstrated, time and again the women involved lied to Mr. Epstein as to 
their true age, representing that they were, in fact, over the age of 18. Many of them also represented 
that they worked at local massage parlors, which presumably would have imposed a legal age 
requirement. 
Lastly, in contrast to 18 U.S.C. §1591, Mr. Epstein's conduct did not involve trafficking of 
women or children in the sex industry, and was not part of any phenomenon that, in the aggregate, 
had an economic impact on interstate or foreign commerce. Additionally, Mr. Epstein did not 
benefit financially from the alleged conduct. Therefore, as the SAO determined, and still believes, 
Mr. Epstein was a customer, a "John" for whom prosecutions are best left to the State to address. 
Indeed, there is no reported precedent extending federal law to a local "John" who does not violate 
the child exploitation statutes. Indeed, CEOS does not point to a single case where federal 
prosecutors have used § 1591 in a case involving facts like these. Instead, every § 1591 prosecution 
has involved national or international sex trafficking and/or for-profit prostitution rings, involving 
the knowing use of minors and/or forcible coercion, or forcible rape, physical abuse or intimidation. 
These are the elements required by the statute, and they are not met here. 
Although CEOS could, perhaps, point to United States v. Evans, 476 F.3d 1176 (11th Cir. 
2007) as a case that, standing alone, involved wholly intrastate conduct, the facts of that case are far 
different in key i‘ttnects than this one. The Evans case involved both the commercial and coercive 
components that Congress, and administration policy statements intended in 18 U.S.C. § 1591 
prosecutions. Evans, and his co-conspirators (Madison and Yearby) were not "Johns." They 
operated a for profit prostitution ring marked by control of, and extreme violence toward, the 
victims, who they knew were underage. Indeed, Evans forced one such victim, age 14 years old, to 
continue to work even after she had been hospitalized with AIDS. As part of their business, Evans 
and his co-conspirators provided the victims with cell phones, hotels, and condoms, and the victims 
were forced to give all of their money from this prostitution ring to Evans and his co-conspirators. 
None of this type of activity comes close to the facts regarding Mr. Epstein. Finally, but significantly, 
the prostitution ring in Evans was not, in fact, entirely intrastate as the companion case of one of the 
Evans co-defendants makes clear. See, United States v. Madison, 477 F.3d 1312, 1313-1314 (11th
Cir. 2007) (Jane Doe #2 stated that she traveled to Atlanta, Georgia with Madison to work as a 
prostitute). 
Thus, courts, including the Eleventh Circuit in Evans, have underscored the point that § 1591 
simply is not intended to cover the kind of alleged conduct at issue here. "Section 1591 does not 
criminalize all acts of prostitution (a vice traditionally governed by state regulation). Rather, its 
reach is limited to sex trafficking that involves children or is accomplished by force, fraud, or 
coercion." United States v. Evans, 476 F.3d at 1179 n. 1; ao gsa United States v. Sims, 171 Fed. 
EFTA00013797

ALLEN GUTHRIE MCHUGH & THOMAS, PLLC 
Mr. John Roth 
June 19, 2008 
Page 14 
Appx. 849, 2006 WL 14581 at *3 (11th Cir. 2006) (to establish Sims's guilt on the sex trafficking of 
a minor count, the government had to show that Sims benefited financially from Owen's sexual 
activity and that Sims knew that (a) force or coercion would be used to cause Owens to engage in a 
criminal sex act or (b) that Owens was under the age of 18.) (emphasis added). Again, none of these 
factors is present in this case. The Eleventh Circuit's interpretation of the statute makes perfect 
sense: were § 1591 not limited in this fashion, it would threaten to criminalize a host of localized 
behavior that has nothing to do with human trafficking, and, thus, is of no valid federal interest. 
In sum, to accord discretion to the USAO, albeit without benefit of the requested full de novo 
review, to exercise authority to pursue a prosecution which involves a "novel" application of three 
federal statutes in the face of numerous "compelling arguments" is not warranted, as it is not 
supported by the facts, the law, or justice. Echoing the admonition of the Supreme Court in the 
Berger decision, the Comment to Rule 3.8 of the Rules of Professional Conduct (Special 
Responsibilities of a Prosecutor), says it best "A prosecutor has the responsibility of a minister of 
justice and not simply that of an advocate. This responsibility carries with it specific obligations to 
see that a defendant is accorded procedural justice and that guilt is decided upon the basis of 
sufficient evidence." This is a responsibility that can not be taken for granted. The government bears 
the burden of assuring that it possesses sufficient evidence to prove each element of a crime with 
respect to some specific victim before publicly branding Mr. Epstein a child molester. In this case, 
however, the USAO has not met its burden for any victim for any of the crimes alleged. It is not 
enough to simply gloss over the required proof, and rely on the jury or the court to just sort it all out 
in the end. The stakes are too high. As a result, the USAO should not be permitted to pursue an 
unfounded federal criminal case against Mr. Epstein under the guise of prosecutorial discretion. 
Such prosecution in this case necessarily would appear to be selective to Mr. Epstein. To be 
clear, our request that Mr. Epstein should not be prosecuted federally would not permit him to go 
completely unpunished, but, rather, would simply place him in the same prosecution position as 
others similarly situated. Therefore, we continue to believe that after a complete, de novo, and 
independent review, the only appropriate conclusion will be that this case is best left to the state to 
resolve.

Response to Letter by FAUSA MI
 Dated May 19, 2008 
In al 
2008 letter to Jay Lefkowitz (See Tab 1), SDFL First Assistant U.S. 
rn
Attoey 
MI 
provided what purported to be a summ 
of the events that have 
occurred during the investigation of Mr. Epstein. 
Mr. 
letter is fraught with 
inconsistencies, false and misleading characterizations and outright falsehoods. The comparison 
below between the false assertions in Mr. 
letter and what actually transpired is only the 
tip of the iceberg. We respectfully submit that Mr. 
letter alone demonstrates the 
degree to which the record of facts have been distorted and these distortions have permeated this 
unprecedented investigation. 
1. 
"INDEPENDENT" AND "DE NOVO" REVIEW. 
Mr. 
Letter: 
• 
"[W]e obliged your request for an independent de novo review of the investigation and 
facilitated such review at the highest levels of the Department of Justice. " Tab 1, May 
19, 2008 Letter from'. 
P. 5, 1 3. 
The Truth: 
• 
CEOS' review, concluded in May 2008, was neither independent nor de novo. 
o CEOS' review was not "independent:" 
• 
who conducted the review on behalf of CEOS, had 
already reviewed the prosecution memo on this matter eight months 
earlier. During a meeting with defense counsel at the United States 
Attorney's Office in Miami (the "USAO") in September of 2007, he 
opined that he so believed in the prosecution that he "would try the case 
myself" 
• Indeed, Mr. 
acknowledges that Mr. 
opined on this matter, stating: 
had previously 
This particular attack on this statute [18 U.S.C. § 2242(b)] 
had been previously raised and thoroughly considered and 
rejected by . . . CEOS prior to the execution of the 
[Deferred Prosecution] Agreement [in September 2007]. 
Id., p. 5 (emphasis added). 
• The statute Mr. 
referred to (§ 2422(b) lies at the heart of the 
Epstein investigation. Thus, according to Mr. 
, Mr. 
was tasked with reviewing his own prior decision regarding applying the 
key statute under which the SDFL proposed prosecuting Mr. Epstein. 
EFTA00013801
--- PAGE 2 ---
KIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP 
■ 
The defense immediately raised concerns regardin the non-independence 
of the review when told that it would be Mr. 
tasked with 
providing the review, but was told that when Mr. 
rendered his 
prior opinion, "he was not really up to speed on the facts" 
o CEOS' review was not de novo: 
• 
B letter dated May 15, 2008 (four days before Mr. 
letter), Mr. 
advised Mr. Lefkowitz that CEOS reviewed the matter only 
for abuse of discretion: 
Mite question we sought to answer was whether U.S. 
Attorney Acosta would abuse his discretion if he 
authorized prosecution in this case. 
See Tab 38, May 15, 2008 Letter from D. EMI, 
p. 1 (emphasis 
added). See also, id., p. 2 ("Mr. Acosta would not be abusing his 
discretion if he decided to pursue such a course of action."); and p. 5 
("Mr. Acosta would not be abusing his prosecutorial discretion should he 
authorized federal prosecution of Mr. Epstein."). 
■ 
For the factual record of its "abuse of discretion" review, CEOS relied on 
the very same prosecution memo that it had already reviewed in rendering 
its prior opinion, stating: 
As you know, our review of this case is limited, both factually and 
legally. We have not looked at the entire universe of facts in this 
case. 
See Id., p. 1 (emphasis added). 
■ 
Nor did CEOS review any facts related to the irregular provisions in the 
Deferred Prosecution Agreement or the numerous complaints of 
prosecutorial misconduct, both of which are inextricably intertwined with 
the impropriety of the investigation. Id. at 1. 
2. 
NOTIFICATION OF WITNESSES. 
Mr. 
Letter: 
• 
Mr. 
dismissed the totality of the defense's objections to the inappropriate 
noti 'cation the SDFL proposed to send to its witnesses, stating merely that: 
"[Y]ou objected to victims['] being notified of time and place of Epstein's 
state[-]court sentencing hearing."

KIRKLAII 
IS LLP 
See Tab 1, May 19, 2008 Letter from 
, p. 4, ¶ 1. 
The Truth: 
• 
The defense engaged in days of negotiation and made 1 
Si
carate substantive objections 
to the unprecedented notification letter that Mr. 
threatened to send to an 
undisclosed list of "victims." The eventual transmission of this highly misleading letter 
was only halted by an appeal to AAG Fisher. Among those substantive objections 
(which related to far more than the "time and place" of the state's sentencing hearing) 
were: 
o Sending the letter would contravene the government's commitment to take no 
position regarding potential claims of government witnesses. 
See Tab 39, 
November 28, 2008 Email from I. Lefkowitz to I. 
o The letter cited to an inapplicable statute (the Justice for All Act of 2004) as its 
justification for being sent. Id. AUSA Acosta later conceded that the citation to 
this statute as a justification was wholly incorrect. 
o The letter wrongly advised all recipients that Mr. Epstein would be required to 
register as "a sexual predator for the remainder of this life." 
o The letter amounted to an invitation to civil litigation against Mr. Epstein, 
advising recipients that they had the right to seek civil damages from Mr. Epstein, 
and in an underlined instruction, stated that if they chose an attorney other than 
the one chosen by the government they would be required to pay his fees, but if 
they chose the government's choice, Mr. Epstein would be required to pay the 
fees. 
3. 
MISCHARACTEFUZATION OF OUR ARGUMENTS. 
Mr. 
Letter: 
• 
Mr. 
letter misleadingly characterizes our substantive defense of the 
government's investigation as, "the investigation merely produced evidence of relatively 
innocuous sexual conduct with some minors who, unbeknownst to Mr. Epstein, 
misrepresented their ages." 
See Tab I, May 19, 2008 Letter from I. 
p. 2. 
The Truth: 
• 
We never made such a claim. To the contrary, we argued that sworn statements we have 
taken of the alleged victims demonstrate that law enforcement has presented versions of 
their testimony that are necessarily sensationalized and fictionalized. 
We presented 
EFTA00013803
--- PAGE 4 ---
KIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP 
evidence that Mr. Epstein routinely and daily receives massages from adults. Only a 
small percentage of the masseuses turned out to be minors. The majority of those minors 
interviewed by law enforcement admitted to lying directly to Epstein about their ages 
(not "unbeknownst to Epstein"), and inventing further false details to substantiate their 
lies. Indeed, the civil attorney for several of these women admitted at his recent press 
conference that they lied to Mr. Epstein about their ages. Numerous witnesses testified 
that Mr. Epstein asked that all masseuses be over the age of 18. Further, the evidence is 
undisputed that Mr. Epstein's assistants scheduled the massages and Mr. Epstein did not 
know which masseuses his assistants had scheduled on a particular day, until the massage 
took place. We admitted that there was sexual conduct, and argued—not that it was 
"innocuous" as Mr. 
alleges—but that it was mostly Mr. Epstein's own self-
pleasuring, which did not satisfy the requisite federal clement of criminal sexual conduct 
(which is in turn, defined by state law). These are important distinctions and show that 
Mr. 
has misrepresented the record about the most basic part of our defense.

Mr 
DEMANDS AN UNREALISTIC DEADLINE TO COMPLY WITH AN 
AGREEMENT HE UNILATERALLY MODIFIES. 
Letter: 
• "Unless [Mr. Epstein] complies with all of the terms and conditions of the [Deferred 
Prosecution] Agreement, as modified by the United States Attorney's December 19, 
2007 letter to Ms. Sanchez by close of business on Monday, June 2, 2008, the SDFL will 
elect to terminate the Agreement." Id., p.1 
The Truth: 
• The Deferred Prosecution Agreement was never modified by U.S. Attorney Acosta's 
December 19, 2007 letter. Oddly, Mr. 
acknowledges this on page 4 of his May 
letter, where he writes that Mr. Acosta "proposed" this modification and that "[Mr. 
Lefkowitz] rejected these proposals." Thus, Mr. 
is threatening to terminate the 
Deferred Prosecutioniriment, unless Mr. Epstein complies with a unilateral 
modification that Mr. 
concedes was never agreed to by defense counsel. 
• Orchestrating the information, plea and sentencing requirements of the Deferred 
Prosecution Agreement within the extremely limited two-week timeframe imposed by 
Mr. 
June 2, 2008 deadline would have been difficult enough. 
• More importantly, as explained below, the SDFL has refused to provide the defense with 
information it requires to enable Mr. Epstein to comply with the additional plea and 
sentencing requirements of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement (let alone, by the June 2 
deadline arbitrarily imposed by Mr. ). 
o The Deferred Prosecution Agreement requires Mr. Epstein to plead guilty to and 
be sentenced for an additional offense which requires that he be registered as a 
sex offender. 
In different places in his May 19, 2008 letter, Mr. 
EFTA00013804
--- PAGE 5 ---
KIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP 
describes the additional charge to which Mr. Epstein is required to plead guilty 
under the Deferred Prosecution Agreement as "procurement of minors to engage 
in prostitution" or "solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution." The former 
is an offense for which Mr. Epstein would be required to register, but one for 
which the state has no evidence to charge Mr. Epstein and the SDFL refuses or is 
unable to provide evidence that it claims it has. 
The latter re uires no 
registration, but it is the offense which, over and over again, Ms. 
insisted upon including in the Deferred Prosecution Agreement, and is one which 
the State believes is appropriate. The inconsistency between the description of 
the offense required by the SDFL, the elements of an offense that can be justified 
on the facts of this case and the SDFL's requirement that the offense be a 
registrable one has created substantial confusion. 
o As a result of this confusion, in December 2007, both the defense and the state 
requested that the SDFL provide the factual allegations to enable Mr. Epstein and 
the State to create a truthful factual recitation of a registrable offense required by 
the Deferred Prosecution Agreement, but, to date, the SDFL has failed to do so 
without any explanation. 
• 
Mr. 
refuses to provide the requested factual allegations, which the State cannot 
furnish, and now demands a two week deadline to comply. Thus Mr. 
has 
unreasonably imposed a deadline with which he himself has made it impossible for Mr. 
Epstein to comply. 
5. 
WAIVER OF APPEAL TO ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL FISHER. 
Mr. 
Letter: 
• 
"[T]he SDFL provided you with 30 days to appeal the decision to the Assistant Attorney 
General of the United States Alice Fisher" and "you chose to forego an appeal to AAG 
Fisher." 
Id., p. 2. 
The Truth: 
• 
Mr. Acosta tolled an August 17 deadline, acknowledging that there were "serious issues" 
about the case that needed to be discussed, and scheduled a meetin with the defense for 
September 7, 2007. 
At the September 7, 2007 meeting, with 
in 
attendance, the government dismissed the defense's objections and set a September 21, 
2007 deadline to finalize a non-prosecution agreement or the defense would face an 
already-drafted 53-page indictment, purportedly identifying 40 minors, with a guideline 
range of 188 months. 
• 
Facing Ms. 
threatened draconian indictment, without the claimed offer of the 
right to raise objections in an appeal to AAG Fisher, the defense chose to negotiate an 
EFTA00013805
--- PAGE 6 ---
KIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP 
Agreement to Defer Prosecution to the State, an agreement without precedent and fraught 
with substantial practical and legal hurdles to its implementation. 
6. 
THE SDFL DID NOT DEFER TO THE STATE. 
Letter: 
• "[T]he SDFL indicated a willingness to defer to the State the length of incarceration." 
Id., p. 2. 
The Truth: 
• 
The SDFL neither deferred to the State, nor even discussed with the State, the len th of 
Mr. 
ein's incarceration. In a letter to the defense, Criminal Division Chief, 
rejected the sentence contemplated by the State's plea agreement, writing that 
"the federal interest will not be vindicated in the absence of a two- ear term of state 
imprisonment." See Tab 40, August 3, 2007 Email from 
. Of course, this 
position is contrary to Section 9-2031D of the U.S. Attorney's Manual (indicating that 
the "result" of a state prosecution is "presumed ' to have vindicated the federal interest). 
It is understandable, therefore, that Mr. 
might want to retreat from it now. 
Indeed, the final Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) restricts the state-court judge 
from exercising any of his rightful discretion and to specifically prohibit the judge from 
offering probation, community control or any other alternative in lieu of incarceration. 
DPA, 1 2(a). 
7. 
SUGGESTION OF ADDITIONAL STATE PLEA 
Mr. 
Letter: 
• 
The parties considered: "as suggested by [the defense], a plea to state charges 
encompassing Epstein's conduct." See Tab 1, May 19, 2008 Letter from'. =, 
p.2, 
¶ 2. 
The Truth: 
• 
It was the government, and not the defense that suggested a plea to state charges to 
resolve the federal investigation. 
proposed declining prosecution in favor 
of the state. Although Mr. Epstein and the State Attorney's Office had already reached 
a plea agreement, in August 2007, Mr. 
and AUSA 
warned that 
they intended to prosecute Epstein federally unless his counsel (i.e., not the U.S. 
Attorney's Office) sought more stringent conditions to the State's proposed plea 
agreement. These strip ent conditions included, among other things, the two-year prison 
term demanded by Mr. 
(discussed above) and a charge requiring him to register 
as a sex offender.

8. 
ALL IDENTIFIED VICTIMS BE PUT IN SAME POSITION AS IF EPSTEIN 
HAD BEEN TRIED. 
Mr. 
Letter: 
• 
"The Agreement provides for a method of compensation for the victims such that they 
would be placed in the same position as if Epstein had been convicted of one of the 
enumerated offenses set forth in Title 18, United States Code Section, 2255." 
Id. 
The Truth: 
• 
Mr. 
continues to mischaracterize the highly irregular provisions of the Deferred 
Prosecution Agreement. The SDFL did not merely attempt to preserve the compensation 
rights of those it identified as victims; it attempted to create compensation rights for those 
it identified, without imposing on them the burden of proving that they were in fact 
victims under § 2255. 
o In the Deferred Prosecution Agreement, the SDFL required Mr. Epstein to waive 
the right to contest liability under 18 U.S.C. § 2255 as to a list of individuals that 
the SDFL would not disclose to Mr. Epstein until after he was sentenced and to 
pay for an attorney to secure compensation under § 2255 for those undisclosed 
individuals, or if they decided to sue Mr. Epstein. 
o § 2255 ordinarily provides individuals with a right to recover minimum guaranteed 
damages of $150,000, without having to prove actual damages, only if: (1) they 
were victims of an enumerated federal offense, including offenses under 18 U.S.C. 
§§ 2422 and 2423, (2) they were minors at the time of the offense, and most 
importantly (3) they were personally injured as a result of the offense. 
o The defense has confirmed examples of women who testified that they were not 
victims of Mr. Epstein and suffered no personal injury. These women were, 
nevertheless, on the list of "victims" identified by the government. . In fact, when 
confronted with the testimony of a women who denied both being a victim and 
incurring personal injury, Ms. 
actually acknowledged such testimony. 
y inclusion of that woman on the government's list, however, Ms.
lI
istif 
then challenged her own witness's credibility. 
• 
For this reason, it is false to state that these "identified" individuals are in the same 
position that they would have been had Epstein been convicted at trial. Had there been a 
trial, Mr. Epstein would have had a right to confront these individuals through cross-
examination. Any individual that did not establish that she was a minor victim of conduct 
that satisfied each element of an enumerated statute under § 2255,or that she suffered 
personal injury, would not qualify for any treatment under § 2255. However, under the 
Deferred Prosecution Agreement, as an "identified individual" on the government's list, 
EFTA00013807
--- PAGE 8 ---
KIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP 
this same individual would nevertheless be entitled to engage an attorney paid for by Mr. 
Epstein to recover $150,000 of damages from Mr. Epstein under § 2255 without ever 
alleging any injury. In fact, the defense was told that the only question Mr. Epstein 
would be permitted to ask before paying the girls is " have you ever met Epstein.". Thus, 
the Deferred Prosecution Agreement places identified individuals in a far better position 
than they would be in if Mr. Epstein were convicted at trial. 
9. 
ASSIGNMENT OF RIGHT TO SELECT LEGAL REPRESENTATIVE. 
Mr. 
Letter: 
• "Prior to any issues arising concerning the implementation of the 2255 provision, the 
SDFL unilaterally agreed to assign its responsibility to select the attorney representative 
for the alleged victims to an independent third-party." 
See Tab 1, May 19, 2008 Letter from'. 
p. 4, f.3. 
The Truth: 
• 
That such an assignment was the SDFL's "unilateral" decision is false. Before the 
SDFL decided to assi 
selection of the "attorney representative" to an independent third 
party, AUSA 
had already proposed an "attorney representative." She 
had proposed local products-liability lawyer, Humberto Ocariz, and claimed he had been 
recommended by a "good friend in the Appellate Division." Ms. 
account was 
misleading, as it omitted that this "good friend" was her live-in boyfriend, and that Mr. 
Ocariz was his former law-school roommate. When we discovered this independently, 
we objected. 
Only then did the SDFL propose assigning the selection process to an 
independent special master and agree to amend the Deferred Prosecution Agreement. 
Thus, while it may be true that the SDFL assigned its selection responsibility to avoid the 
appearance of favoritism, it did not do it "unilaterally," but, rather, only after Epstein 
uncovered the Office's misleading disclosure and apparent conflict-of-interest. 
10. 
TIMETABLE FOR MOVING FORWARD. 
Mr. 
Letter: 
• "On February 25, 2008, I sent you an e-mail setting forth a timetable for moving forward 
in the event that CEOS disagreed with your position. That time is now." 
Id., p. 6. 
The Truth: 
• Mr. 
provides only part of the history of this case in order to justify his improper 
actions. He had stated he would close the investigation if CEOS told him to. However, 
CEOS at our very first contact said that under no circumstances did they see that as their 
EFTA00013808
--- PAGE 9 ---
KIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP 
role. They said they would only advise on an abuse of discretion standard. Making the 
outcome a foregone conclusion. Furthermore, in response to the February 25 e-mail, 
which attempted to establish a schedule to limit the entire review process (the defense has 
repeatedly suggested that the misconduct was intertwined with the investigation and 
would therefore seek higher review), Mr. Lefkowitz e-mailed Mr. Acosta directly. On 
February 29, 2028 Mr. 
responded to Mr. Lefkowitz's e-mail to Mr. Acosta, 
stating that Mr. 
was acting out of frustration, but "[p]lease be assured that it has 
not, and never has been, this Office's intent to interfere or restrict the "review process" 
for either Mr. Epstein or CEOS. I leave it to you and CEOS to figure out how best to 
proceed and will await the results of that process." As stated above, CEOS determined 
that it would not review many of the defense's objections and as to the remainder of those 
objections, its review would be limited (contrary to Mr. Acosta's assurances), which left 
the need, supplemented by the defense's subsequent request, for a more thorough review 
of critical issues by others at the Department of Justice. Mr. 
re-imposition of 
the (albeit modestly extended) timetable was an obvious attempt, in violation of his 
February 29 agreement, to thwart the request made by the defense to the Deputy Attorney 
general, to complete the review process that Mr. Acosta had promised. 
11. 
"DELAY." 
Mr. 
Letter: 
• 
In a section entitled "Delay," Mr. 
states that "the SDFL again agreed to 
accommodate Epstein's request to appear in state court for plea and sentencing on 
January 4, 2008." 
Id., p. 3. 
The Truth: 
• 
Curiously, Mr. 
fails to mention correspondence from the U.S. Attorney stating 
that delay of that date would be "inevitable" as the defense has raised "serious questions" 
about the propriety of the prosecution. Strikingly, in that same section, Mr. 
claims that "the Agreement did not contemplate a staggered `plea and sentencing,"' 
despite quoting, three sentences earlier, from the Agreement's staggered requirement 
that Epstein plead and be sentenced by October 26, and "begin serving his sentence not 
later than January 4, 2008." 
We are, like most attorneys seeking Department review, without access to the USAO 
prosecution summaries or other submissions to the Department. Given the substantial issues that 
have been raised in this and other submissions, we request that you conduct a de novo review 
that goes beneath the face of any conclusions being advocated by the USAO; instead, we seek a 
review that is based on the transcripts of witness testimony themselves so that the reviewer can 
EFTA00013809
--- PAGE 10 ---
KIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP 
make an independent decision not adversely affected by conclusions that over and over have 
proven, witness by witness, allegation by allegation, to be inaccurate and unwarranted and not an 
appropriate basis for the exercise of federal prosecutorial authority.

KIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP 
SUBMISSION TO THE OFFICE OF THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL 
IN THE MATTER OF JEFFREY E. EPSTEIN 
Jeffrey Epstein, a successful businessman and noted philanthropist with no prior criminal 
record, has been investigated for potential violations of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591, 2422(b) and 2423(b). 
Since the limited review conducted by CEOS, two Supreme Court decisions—one authored by 
Justice Scalia and the other by Justice Thomas—have revitalized the bedrock principles that 
federal criminal statutes must be narrowly construed, that they may not be stretched to federalize 
conduct not clearly covered by their prohibitions, and that whenever there are two plausible 
constructions of a criminal statute, the narrower construction (hich safeguards liberty) rather than 
the broader construction (which expands the federal prosecutor's arsenal) controls under the 
venerable rule of lenity. 
Mr. Epstein's conduct—including his misconduct—falls within the heartland of historic 
state police and prosecutorial powers. Absent a significant federal nexus, matters involving 
prostitution have always been treated as state-law crimes even when they involve minors. Mr. 
Epstein's conduct lacks any of the hallmarks that would convert this quintessential state crime 
into a federal one under any of the statutes prosecutors are considering. 
Mr. Epstein lived in Palm Beach, and his interstate travel was merely to go home. My 
sexual conduct that occurred after he arrived was incidental to the purposes for his travel. Even 
CEOS admitted that applying § 2423(b) to a citizen traveling home would be "novel." In fact, it 
would be both unprecedented and in conflict with Supreme Court cases that have withstood the 
test of time for over 60 years. 
Moreover, Mr. Epstein did not use the intemet (either via email or chatrooms) to 
communicate with any of the witnesses in this investigation. Indeed, he did not use any other 
facility of interstate commerce, including the phone, to knowingly persuade, entice, or induce 
anyone to visit his home—the "local" locus of all the incidents under investigation—much less 
to persuade, entice, or induce a known minor to engage in prohibited sex acts, as § 2422(b) 
requires. Nor did anyone on his behalf "persuade" or "induce" or "entice" or "coerce" anyone as 
these words are ordinarily understood and as the new Supreme Court decisions mandate they be 
applied: narrowly, without stretching ordinary usage to conform to a prosecutor's case-specific 
need for a broad (and in this case unprecedented) application. In addition, as will be shown 
below, § 2422(b) requires that the object of the communication be a state law offense that "can 
be charged." Yet because the state of Florida's statute of limitations is one year for the first 
prostitution offense and three years for other targeted offenses, and because all or virtually all of 
the offense conduct at issue in the federal investigation occurred prior to June 20, 2005, those 
acts can not be charged by the State, and thus cannot meet this essential clement of federal law. 
Finally, Mr. Epstein neither coerced, nor enslaved, nor trafficked, nor derived any profit 
from his sexual conduct. He was an ordinary "John," not a pimp. But § 1591 is directed only 
against those who engage in force or fraud or coercion or who are in the business of commercial 
EFTA00013811
--- PAGE 2 ---
KIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP 
sexual trafficking. The statute has never been applied to a "John," and only a highly and 
impermissibly selective prosecution could stretch § 1591 to reach conduct like that at issue in 
this case. 
In short, without "novel" interpretive expansions—a description used by CEOS itself—it 
cannot be shown that Mr. Epstein violated any of the three federal statutes identified by 
prosecutors. As the Supreme Court's recent decisions in Santos and Cuellar make clear, federal 
law may not be stretched in that manner, and the current federal investigation relies, as its 
foundation, on impermissibly elastic stretches of each statute beyond any reported precedent; 
beyond the essential elements of each statute; well outside the ordinary construction of each 
statute's limitations; and on a selective, extraordinary, and unwarranted expansion of federal law 
to cover conduct that has always been exclusively within the core of state powers. 
At this point in time, the need for Departmental oversight is critical. We appreciate this 
opportunity to submit our assessment of the key facts in this case and review of the pertinent 
federal statutes, and respectfully request that the Office of the Deputy Attorney General end 
federal involvement in this matter so that the State of Florida may resolve this case appropriately. 
Summary of the Facts 
Mr. Epstein has maintained a home in Palm Beach, Florida for the past 20 years. While 
there, he routinely conducted business, received medical attention, socialized with friends, and 
helped care for his elderly mother. Mr. Epstein also had various women visit his home to 
perform massages. He did not personally schedule the massage appointments or communicate 
with the women over the phone or the Internet. Rather, Mr. Epstein's personal assistants 
scheduled many types of appointments, personal trainers, chiropractors, business meetings and 
massages. 
The phone message pad taken from his house and in the possession of the 
government confirmed that in many cases, the women themselves contacted Mr. Epstein's 
assistants to inquire about his availability—rather than vice versa. 
The majority of the massages were just that and nothing else. Mr. Epstein often would be 
on the telephone conducting business while he received his massage. At times, the masseuses 
would be topless, and some sexual activity might occur—primarily self-masturbation on the part 
of Mr. Epstein. On other occasions, no sexual activity would occur at all. There was no pattern 
or practice regarding which masseuse would be scheduled on a particular day—if one would be 
scheduled at all—or whether any sexual activity might occur. Indeed, Mr. Epstein almost never 
knew which masseuse his assistants had scheduled until she arrived. See Tab 3, 
Toll 
Records. 
Mr. Epstein specifically requested that each masseuse be at least 18 years old. The vast 
majority of the masseuses were in fact in their twenties, many accompanied to Mr. Epstein's 
home by friends or even other family members. Furthermore, most of the women who have 
testified that they were actually under 18 have specifically admitted tbrimatically lying to 
Mr. Epstein about their age. See Tab 4 
Tr. at 38-39; Tab 5, 
Tr. at 16; Tab 6, 
EFTA00013812
--- PAGE 3 ---
KIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP 
Tr. at 6 8, 22, 45; Tab 7, 
Tr. 13; Tab 8 
Tr. at 8; Tab 9, 
Tr. at 5; and 
Tab 
Tr. at 14-15 (excerpts from these transcripts are included below). Furthermore, 
the women who visited Mr. Epstein's home all visited voluntarily and many willingly returned 
several times. 
The State Attorney's Office (the "SAO") has vast experience prosecuting sex crimes and 
conducted an exhaustive, 15-month investigation of Mr. Epstein. A Grand Jury has concluded 
that Mr. Epstein was merely a local "John," guilty of soliciting prostitution in violation of state 
law. Notably, Florida law distinguishes soliciting from procuring and compelling prostitution if 
minors are involved. Indeed, soliciting is a misdemeanor except for the commission of a third 
subsequent offense, turning it into a felony. The SAO, therefore, sought and obtained an 
indictment charging Mr. Epstein with felony solicitation of prostitution. Mr. Epstein is prepared 
to plead guilty and accept a sentence for that offense—a sentence that, notably, is far more 
severe than that meted out to other "Johns" convicted of violating Florida's solicitation laws for 
cases in which sexual activity was alleged. 
Though CEOS points out its admirable goal of "protecting children," a moniker that 
engenders high emotions, the conduct alleged here involves women over 16, which is the age of 
consent in 38 states and supplies the effective federal age of consent. The young women were by 
no means the target of high-school trolling; they were individuals who, with friends, visited Mr. 
Epstein's house—a home full of friends and staff. The civil complaints filed against Mr. Epstein 
reiterate the fact that the individuals who visited Mr. Epstein would visit with their friends. And 
Mr. Epstein never spoke to or had any contact with these women before they arrived at his 
house. And again, the State is handling this matter appropriately. 
We respectfully submit that that should be the beginning and the end of this matter. As 
you know, the Department's Petite Policy precludes successive federal prosecutions after a State 
has acted: "[A] state judgment of conviction, plea agreement [here held in abeyance solely as a 
result of the federal investigation], or acquittal on the merits shall be a bar to any subsequent 
federal prosecution for the same act or acts." 
U.S.A.M. § 9-2.031A (emphasis added). 
Consistent with that principle, and of particular relevance to this case, the Department itself just 
recently observed the following: 
[P]rostitution-related offenses have historically been prosecuted at the state or 
local level. This allocation between state and Federal enforcement authority does 
not imply that these crimes arc less serious, but rather reflects important structural 
allocations of responsibility between state and Federal governments.... [T]he 
Department is not aware of any reasons why state and local authorities are not 
currently able to pursue prostitution-related crimes such that Federal jurisdiction 
is necessary. 
See Tab 11, November 9, 2007 Letter from Justice Department Principal Deputy Assistant 
Attorney General Brian Benczkowski to the House Committee on the Judiciary, p. 8-9.

KIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP 
Summary of the Law 
We have reviewed every reported case under 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591, 2422(b), and 2423(b), 
and cannot find a single one that resulted in a conviction on facts akin to the ones here. In some 
respects, it is not surprising that no precedent supports federal prosecution of a man who engaged 
in consensual conduct, in his home, that amounts to solicitation under State law. After all, 
prostitution, even when the allegations involve minors, is fundamentally a State concern, United 
States v. Evans, 476 F.3d 1176, n.1 (11th Cir. 2007) (noting that federal law "does not 
criminalize all acts of prostitution (a vice traditionally governed by state regulation)"), and there 
is no evidence that Palm Beach County authorities and Florida prosecutors cannot effectively 
prosecute and punish the conduct. See also Batchelder v. Gonzalez, No. 4:07-cv-00330-SPM-
AK, 2007 WL 5022105 (N.D. Fla. Oct. 19, 2007). In fact, the opposite is true—the state-elected 
officials, cognizant of the local mores of the community, have a lauded history of just such 
prosecutions. 
In any event, and as set forth below, none of the federal statutes in this case remotely 
supports a prosecution on the facts of this case without each and every element being stretched in 
a novel way to encompass the behavior at issue. We begin with first principles. Courts in this 
country have "traditionally exercised restraint in assessing the reach of federal criminal statutes, 
both out of deference to the prerogatives of Congress, Dowling v. United States, 473 U.S. 207 
(1985), and out of concern that `a fair warning should be given to the world in language that the 
common world will understand, of what the law intends to do if a certain line is passed!" Arthur 
Andersen LLP v. United States, 544 U.S. 696, 703 (2005) (quoting McBoyle v. United States, 283 
U.S. 25, 27 (1931)) (citation omitted). 
Two recent Supreme Court decisions dramatically underscore these principles and help to 
highlight why federal prosecution in this case would be improper as a matter of both law and 
policy. See United States v. Santos, No. 06-1005 (June 2, 2008); Cuellar v. United States, No. 
06-1456 (June 2, 2008). Though they both address the interpretation and application of the 
federal money laundering statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1956, the principles they set forth are equally 
applicable here. In Santos, the Court held that the statutory term "proceeds" means "profits" 
rather than "receipts," and thus gave the statute a significantly narrower interpretation than what 
the government had urged. In his plurality opinion, Justice Scalia emphasized that where a 
statutory term in a criminal statute could support either a narrow or broad application, the narrow 
interpretation must be adopted because "[A/c interpret ambiguous criminal statutes in favor of 
defendants, not prosecutors." Slip op. at 12. As his opinion explained, the rule of lenity "not 
only vindicates the fundamental principle that no citizen should be held accountable for a 
violation of a statute whose commands are uncertain, or subjected to punishment that is not 
clearly proscribed. It also places the weight of inertia upon the party that can best induce 
EFTA00013814
--- PAGE 5 ---
KIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP 
Congress to speak more clearly and keeps courts from making criminal law in Congress's stead." 
Slip op. at 6.' 
In Cuellar, the Court examined the link between the money-laundering statute's mere rea 
requirement and the underlying elements of the offense. After a careful textual analysis of the 
statute and its structure, the Court ruled that the defendant's conviction could be sustained only if 
he knew that the transportation of funds to Mexico was designed to conceal their nature, 
location, source, ownership or control—not merely that the defendant knew that the funds had 
been hidden during their transportation to Mexico. Slip op. at 10-17. 
Both decisions relied on the ordinary meaning of the statutory terms Congress chose. 
And both rejected attempts to broaden those words to cover conduct not clearly targeted by 
Congress. Taken together, these decisions reject the notion that prosecutors can take language 
from a narrowly drawn federal statute—especially one that itself federalizes the prosecution of 
conduct traditionally within the heartland of State police powers—and convert it into a license to 
reach additional conduct by ignoring, rewriting or expansively interpreting the law. Both cases 
additionally rejected the notion that statutes should be broadly construed in order to facilitate 
prosecutions or to in anyway diminish the burden on prosecutors to prove each essential element 
of a federal charge in conformity with Congress's determinations as to what is within the federal 
criminal law and what is not. The conflict between the Santos and Cuellar decisions and 
CEOS's grant of effectively unlimited discretionary authority to the USAO to take federal law to 
"novel" places where they have never reached before could not be starker. 
These lessons have no less force in the context of Executive Branch decision-making 
than they do in the context of Judicial interpretation. As you are aware, when federal prosecutors 
exercise their discretion, they bear an independent constitutional obligation to faithfully interpret 
the law as written—not to broaden its scope beyond the limits endorsed by both Congress and 
the President. There is no support for CEOS's view that the courts or a jury should ultimately 
decide whether a "novel" construction of the law is correct. Instead, the Executive Branch itself 
has a non-delegable obligation not to exceed its authority; the power of other branches to check 
or remedy such usurpation does not legitimize executive action that exceeds its bounds. See Tab 
12, November 2, 1994 Memorandum from Assistant Attorney General Walter Dellinger to the 
Hon. Abner J. Mikva, Counsel To The President, on Presidential Authority To Decline To 
Execute Unconstitutional Statutes, available at http://www.usdoj.gov/olc/nonexcut.htm. 
In this case, the text, structure, and history of the relevant federal statutes unambiguously 
indicate that these statutes were designed to address problems of a national and international

scope—not the local conduct that is alleged here—and each of these statutes requires proof of 
the defendant's actual knowledge that simply is not present in this case. Any attempt to stretch 
the language of these statutes to cover this case would be a misuse of the law and contrary to 
express legislative intent. In short, the elements under each federal statute-18 U.S.C. §§ 1591, 
2422(b) and 2423(b)—are not satisfied here. 
1. 
U.S.C. & 2422(b1 
U.S.C. § 2422(b) requires the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the 
defendant engaged in communications over an interstate facility (e.g., the Internet or phone) with 
four concurrent intentions: (I) to knowingly (2) persuade, induce, entice or coerce, or attempt to 
persuade, induce, entice, or coerce (3) a minor (4) to engage in prostitution or criminal sexual 
activity for which the person can be charged. Mr. Epstein's conduct does not satisfy the 
elements of § 2422(b). Each element must be individually stretched, and then conflated in a 
tenuous chain to encompass the alleged conduct with any individual woman. 
As the statute makes clear, the essence of this crime is the communication itself—not the 
resulting act. The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, in Murrell, underscores the point: 
The defendant in Bailey contended that attempt under § 2422(b) `requires the 
specific intent to commit illegal sexual acts rather than just the intent to persuade 
or solicit the minor victim to commit sexual acts.' Id. at 638. In response, the 
court held `[w]hile it may be rare for there to be a separation between the intent to 
persuade and the follow-up intent to perform the act after persuasion, they are two 
clearly separate and different intents and the Congress has made a clear choice to 
criminalize persuasion and the attempt to persuade, not the performance of the 
sexual acts themselves. Hence, a conviction under the statute only requires a 
finding that the defendant had an intent to persuade or to attempt to persuade.' 
United States v. Murrell 368 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir. 2004) (citing United States v. Bailey, 
228 F.3d 637, 638-39 (6th Cir.2000)). Thus, the targeted criminal conduct must occur through 
the interstate facility, not thereafter, and the scienter element must be present at the time of the 
call or Internet contact. 
In this case, however, Mr. Epstein did not use an interstate facility to communicate any 
illegal intention in this case; the phone calls were made by his assistants in the course of setting 
up many other appointments. Neither a conspiracy charge nor a charge of aiding and abetting 
can fulfill the mens rea requirement here. Indeed, neither Mr. Epstein nor his assistants knew 
whether sexual activity would necessarily result from a scheduled massage. And certainly, no 
such activity was ever discussed on the phone by either Mr. Epstein or his assistants. Instead, as 
the record in this case makes clear, many appointments resulted in no illegal sexual activity, and 
often, as confirmed by the masseuses' own testimony, several individuals who were contacted by 
phone visited Mr. Epstein's house and did not perform a massage at all. Where sexual activity 
EFTA00013816
--- PAGE 7 ---
KIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP 
did result, it was mainly self-pleasuring masturbation and not necessarily illegal, but spontaneous 
and resulted from face-to-face conversations during the massage. Thus, the fact that Mr. Epstein 
later may have persuaded any particular masseuse to engage in unlawful activity during the 
massage does not work retroactively to render the earlier scheduling phone call an offense under 
§ 2422(b). Nor is there any evidence that women who returned to Mr. Epstein's home time and 
again were somehow coerced or induced over a facility of interstate commerce to do so. 
The first essential element of § 2422(b) that "[w]hoever, using the mail or any facility or 
means of interstate or foreign commerce," by its plain language, requires that the 
communication, which is the essence of the crime and its actus reus, take place during the use of 
the facility of interstate commerce (in this case, unlike the vast majority of Internet chat room 
sting operations, a telephone). The statute is not ambiguous. It requires that the criminal 
conduct occur while the defendant is "using" (i.e. engaged in the communication), not thereafter. 
Given the utter lack of direct evidence against Mr. Epstein, prosecutors have signaled that 
they intend to offer a purely circumstantial case if this matter proceeds to trial—essentially 
arguing that "routine and habit" evidence could substitute for actual proof that an interstate 
facility was used to solicit sex from minors. Thus, despite the fact that the calls themselves were 
not made by Mr. Epstein and did not contain the necessary explicit communication to knowingly 
induce minors to provide sexual favors for money, prosecutors are seeking to turn the phrase "are 
you available"—the same phrase used with friends, chiropractors, and trainers—into a ten-year 
mandatory prison sentence. In any case, the prosecution's attenuated argument regarding 
"routine and habit" will also not fit the facts of this case. The witness testimony at issue makes 
clear that there was no clear "routine or habit" with respect to the interactions at issue. And in 
those unpredictable instances where sexual contact resulted, it was a product of what occurred 
after the benign phone communication, not during the call itself. 
The prosecution's theory of liability—that a call to a person merely to schedule a visit to 
the defendant's residence followed by a decision made at the residence to engage in prohibited 
sexual activity is sufficient—cannot survive either a "plain language" test or the rule of lenity as 
they have been authoritatively construed in the recent Santos and Cuellar cases. The statute 
cannot be read otherwise. As the Cuellar decision makes clear, a proper interpretation of a 
federal criminal statute is guided "by the words of the operative statutory provision," not by 
outside objectives, such as those facilitating successful prosecution. See Cuellar, supra, Slip op. 
at 7. As Justice Alito stated in his concurring opinion, the government must prove not just the 
"effect" of the secretive transportation, but also that "petitioner knew that achieving one of these 
effects was a design (i.e. purpose) of the transportation" of currency. Cuellar v. United States, 
supra, 553 U.S., Slip op. At 1 (Alito, J. concurring). Similarly, it is not enough that one effect of 
a communication scheduling a visit between Mr. Epstein and a minor was that there might be 
subsequent face-to-face inducement. Instead, the statute, as drafted, defines the crime as the 
communication and demands that far more be proven than that the use of an interstate facility 
resulted in a later meeting where even an inducement (as opposed to a solicitation) was made. 
EFTA00013817

KIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP 
The prosecution has never represented to counsel that they have evidence that would 
prove that the inducement or enticement to engage in illegal sexual acts occurred over the phone 
(or Internet). The prosecution's references to "routine and habit" evidence that would substitute 
for the explicit communications usually found in the transcripts from chat rooms or sting 
operations is tenuous at best. In essence, the prosecution would be alleging communications 
understood, but not spoken, by two people, one of whom was usually a secretary or assistant. 
Separating the actus reus and the mens rea, however, and premising criminal liability on 
persuasion that might occur after the communication, or on the existence of a specific intent to 
engage in illegal sex with a minor that arises after the communication would violate the bedrock 
principle of criminal law that predicates liability on the concurrence of the act and the criminal 
state of mind. Even if, arguendo, the communication and mens rea could be separated (a 
premise which is at odds with the requirement of concurrence), Mr. Epstein denies that the 
factual proof demonstrates such a pattern or practice. Instead, the evidence compellingly proves 
that there was no regularity or predictability to the content of the communication or in what 
occurred at meetings that were telephonically scheduled (including those that are the subject of 
this investigation). 
A second essential element of 2422(6) requires that the defendant "knowingly" induce, 
persuade, entice or coerce a person believed to be a minor. " .. . [K]knowingly . . . induces . .." 
requires the Court to define inducement so it is consistent with its ordinary usage and so the term 
is not so broad that it subsumes the separate statutory terms of "entices" and "persuades." 
Inducement has a common legal meaning that has been endorsed by the government when it 
operates to narrow the affirmative defense of entrapment. Inducement must be more than "mere 
solicitation;" it must be more than an offer or the providing of an opportunity to engage in 
prohibited conduct. See, e.g,. United States v. Sanchez-Berrios, 424 F.3d 65, 76-77 (ls' Cir. 
2005); United States v. Brown, 43 F.3d 618, 625 (11th Cir. 1995). The government cannot fairly, 
or consistent with the rule of lenity, advocate a broader definition of the same term when it 
expands a citizen's exposure to criminal liability than when it limits the ambit of an affirmative 
defense to criminal conduct. If the term is ambiguous, absent clear Congressional intent on the 
issue, the Court's decision in Santos requires that the narrower rather than the broader definition 
be used. 
The facts simply do not prove Mr. Epstein's culpability for knowingly inducing or 
persuading minors. First, in the case of masseuses who agreed or even sought to return to see 
Mr. Epstein on successive occasions, there is no evidence that there was any inducement, 
persuasion, enticement or coercion over the phone. And, for masseuses seeing Mr. Epstein for 
the first time, there was generally no telephone contact with Mr. Epstein and there was no 
knowledge that any third party at Mr. Epstein's specific direction was inviting them to Mr. 
Epstein's home over the phone rather than in face-to-face meetings. The women who visited Mr. 
Epstein's home were all friends of friends. Contrary to the facts in this case, § 2422(b)'s 
knowing inducement element is essential to federal liability and, given its hefty minimum 
mandatory punishment, it should not be interpreted as a strict liability statute. 
EFTA00013818
--- PAGE 9 ---
KIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP 
There is insufficient evidence that Mr. Epstein targeted minors, as required. 
The 
evidentiary pattern does not even establish willful blindness since Mr. Epstein took steps to 
ensure his visitors were over 18—and certainly took none to avoid knowing. But, even if the 
government contends that it possesses evidence that could demonstrate that Mr. Epstein knew or 
should have known or suspected that a small number of the masseuses were underage, that would 
still not make this an appropriate case for federal, rather than state prosecution. The federal 
statutes were not intended to supersede state prosecutions involving isolated instances of 
underage sex. 
Instead, the federal statutes were intended for large-scale rings or for an 
individual who was engaged, while using interstate facilities such as the Internet, with the willful 
targeting of minors. 
The government's evidence, even when stretched to the limit, will not show a pattern of 
targeting underage persons for illegal sexual activity. A federal prosecution should not become a 
contest between the prosecution and defense over whether the defendant knew, suspected or 
should have known whether a particular person was or was not over age. The history of cases 
brought under this statute make crystal clear that knowledge of the defendant regarding the age 
of the women is required—either by admission or by incontrovertible transcripts of 
conversations (i.e. stings operations which require repeated acknowledgment of the defendant's 
awareness of the victims' age). Even states with absolute liability about mistake regarding age 
rarely prosecute cases where definitive proof is lacking (Palm Beach County rarely does and 
when it does, it imposes house arrest sentences). This is a matter for the exercise of state 
prosecutorial discretion and not federal mandatory minimum statutes that were not intended to 
cover such conduct. 
A third essential element of § 2422(b) is the requirement that the government prove that 
the defendant actually believed that the person being persuaded (coerced, etc.) was a minor at the 
time of the communication. See e.g., Offense Instruction 80, Eleventh Circuit Pattern Jury 
Instructions-Criminal (2003) ("The defendant can be found guilty of that offense only if...the 
defendant believed that such individual was less than (18) years of age..."); United States v. 
Murrell, 368 F.3d 1283, 1286 (11th Cir. 2004) (§ 2422(b) requires that the defendant knowingly 
target a minor). Importantly, then, all the elements must be proven with respect to a specific 
person. However, we arc told that the majority of proof is no more than toll records, not 
recorded conversations or Internet chat transcripts, but toll re-cords and perhaps a memory of 
what was said years ago on a particular call for a particular request from a particular person 
acting at Mr. Epstein's direction. 
Two final points bear special emphasis here. The statute, which according to Santos and 
Cuellar must be narrowly construed, also requires that the inducement be to engage in 
prostitution or sexual activity "for which [the defendant] can be charged." 18 U.S.C. § 2422(b). 
However, simple prostitution is not defined (or made punishable) in the U.S. Code, and state law 
thus supplies the appropriate reference point. Under Florida law, "prostitution" entails the 
"giving or receiving of the body for sexual activity for hire," Fla. Stat. § 796.07(1)(a), and the 
term "sexual activity" is limited to "oral, anal, or vaginal penetration by, or union with, the 
EFTA00013819
--- PAGE 10 ---
KIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP 
sexual organ of another; anal or vaginal penetration of another by any other object; or the 
handling or fondling of the sexual organ of another for the purpose of masturbation." Fla. Stat. § 
796.01(1Xd). Also, the Florida Supreme Court jury instructions define prostitution as involving 
"sexual intercourse." As a result, topless massages—even ones for hire that include self-
masturbation—fall outside the ambit of the state-law definition of prostitution. Absent proof 
beyond a reasonable doubt that, at the critical time of the communication, Mr. Epstein had a 
specific intent to persuade another to engage in prostitution or "sexual activity," as defined by 
Florida law, he cannot be guilty of an offense under § 2422(b). 
As important, the plain language of the phrase "for which any person can be charged" 
necessarily excludes acts as to which the state's statute of limitations has run. Under Florida 
law, prostitution and prostitution-related offenses are misdemeanors in the second degree for a 
first violation.2 See Fla. Stat.. § 796.07(4)(a). The limitations period for a misdemeanor in the 
second degree is one year, and there is no tolling provision based upon the victim's age. See Fla. 
Stat. § 775.15(6). Even as to allegations of third degree felonies, the statute of limitations is 
three years. Thus, any conduct alleged to have occurred before mid-June 2005 cannot be 
charged as a matter of state law and thus cannot be a predicate for a § 2422(b) offense—even if 
the federal statute of limitations has not run on any given § 2422(b) offense because of the 
lengthier statute codified in 18 U.S.C. § 3282. Thus, no prosecution under § 2422(b) can be 
brought based upon inducement of prostitution or sexual activity for which Florida's statute of 
limitation has run. Furthermore, in Florida, the statute of limitations does not simply give rise to 
an affirmative defense. On the contrary, statute of limitations "creates a substantive right which 
prevents prosecution and conviction of an individual after the statute has run." See State v. King, 
282 So. 2d 162 (Fla. 1973); Tucker v. State, 417 So. 2d 1006 (Fla. 3d D.C.A. 1982) (citing 
cases). 
Given the one-year statute of limitations, any conduct that might amount to prostitution 
or other chargeable sexual activity that occurred before one year from today is not conduct for 
which any person can be charged with a criminal offense. Also, given the three year statute of 
limitations for third degree felonies, any allegations of illegal state criminal conduct that is 
classified as a third degree felony cannot be charged in the state and, concomitantly, cannot be 
the basis for a federal charge und 
the extent that it occurred—as did almost all of 
the pivotal allegations (e.g., the 
allegation which was made in March of 2005) 
prior to mid-June of 2005.

U.S.C. § 1591, a sex trafficking statute, provides up to 40 years' imprisonment for 
anyone (1) who recruits or obtains by any means a person in interstate commerce (ii) knowing 
that the person is under 18 and (iii) knowing that the person will be caused to engage in a 
commercial sex act. The most heinous of crimes, described on the CEOS website, fall within 
this statute and include the buying and selling of children and the forced servitude of third-world 
immigrants brought to this country to be enslaved. Mr. Epstein's behavior is nowhere near the 
heartland of this statute. This statute has also been previously reserved for prostitution rings 
involving violence, drugs and force. In stark contrast, there is no jurisdictional hook that brings 
Mr. Epstein's conduct within the ambit of the statute, and securing a prosecution on these facts 
would require a court to set aside both reason and precedent to convict a local `John' with a sex-
slavery crime. It can not be said that Mr. Epstein engaged in trafficking and slavery nor did he 
knowingly recruit or obtain underage women with knowledge that they would be caused to 
engage in a commercial sex act. Thus, prosecuting him under this statute would expand the law 
far beyond its scope. 
To the extent there are cases where prosecutors think that Mr. Epstein should have known 
that certain women were underage, there is no evidence that Mr. Epstein "caused [them] to 
engage in a commercial sex act." The term "cause" naturally implies the application of some 
sort of force, coercion, or undue pressure, but there is no evidence that Mr. Epstein's interactions 
with the women were anything but consensual. Again, many of the women phoned Mr. 
Epstein's assistant themselves in order to determine whether he wanted a massage. Nor can the 
cause requirement be proved simply by the fact that Mr. Epstein compensated the women. After 
all, the statute elsewhere requires that the women "engage in a commercial sex act," which by 
definition means that they would have received something of value in exchange for sexual 
services. Interpreting the statute to authorize prosecution whenever a commercial sex act results 
from solicitation thus would render the term "caused" superfluous, and would make every `John' 
who interacts with an underage prostitute guilty of a federal crime—even where the transaction 
is entirely local. Read in context, then, there is no doubt that the statute targets pimps and sex-
traffickers who knowingly obtain underage girls and direct them to engage in prostitution. There 
is not a shred of evidence that Mr. Epstein (or his assistants) did any such thing, and he cannot be 
prosecuted under this statute. 
The Cuellar and Santos decisions also foreclose a prosecution under § 1591. Just as the 
federal money laundering statute did not come down to a proscription against transportation of 
criminal proceeds that are hidden, the sex trafficking of children statute cannot be boiled down 
and expanded to a federal proscription of commercial sexual activity with persons who turn out 
to be below the age of 18.

U.S.C. § 2423(b), a statute enacted to prevent sex tourism, provides up to 30 years of 
imprisonment for anyone who travels across state lines (i) for the purpose of engaging in (ii) 
illicit sexual conduct with a minor. Neither of those elements is satisfied here. 
Mr. Epstein did not travel to Palm Beach for the purpose of engaging in sexual activity 
with a minor, within the meaning of the statute. The evidence is indisputable that Palm Beach 
was where Mr. Epstein spent most of his discretionary time, and that his travels to Palm Beach 
were merely trips returning often to his home of twenty years—not the escapades of a sex tourist 
off to some destination inextricably intertwined with the required significant or dominant 
purpose of that trip to be to have "illicit sexual conduct." Epstein's trips to Palm Beach were 
simply those of a businessperson traveling home for weekends or stopping over on his way to or 
from New York and St. Thomas or to visit his sick and dying mother in the hospital for months 
on end. He certainly did not travel to his home in Florida for the dominant purpose of engaging 
in sexual conduct with a person who he knew was under 18 when he did not know, at the time he 
decided to travel, from whom he was to receive a massage, if he were to receive one at all. 
In Cuellar, the unanimous Supreme Court linked the term "design" in the money-
laundering statute to the terms "purpose" and "plan," and stressed that those terms all required 
the defendant to "formulate a plan for; devise"; "[t]o create or contrive for a particular purpose or 
effect"; [carry out] "[a] plan or scheme"; or "to conceive and plan out in the mind." Slip. op. at 
(citing dictionary definitions). The same link is present here, and it simply cannot be said that 
Mr. Epstein's design, plan, or purpose in traveling to Palm Beach was to engage in illicit sexual 
conduct with minors; his design or plan or purpose was simply to return to his home. 
Any construction of § 2423(b)'s "for the purpose of language to include purposes 
beyond the dominant purpose of the travel would run afoul of the rule of lenity and due process 
principles discussed earlier. Any attempted prosecution of Mr. Epstein under a more expansive 
construction of the "for the purpose of language would also violate the separation of powers 
doctrine. Congress, which selected the "for the purpose of language signaled no clear intention 
to make it a federal crime whenever an actor has engaged in illicit sexual conduct following his 
crossing of state lines as long as it might be said that sexual activity at his destination was among 
the activities he pursued there. Congress well knows how to write a statute in this field which 
eliminates a purpose requirement. 
See 18 U.S.C. § 2423(c)("Any United States citizen or alien 
admitted for permanent residence who travels in foreign commerce, and engages in any illicit 
sexual conduct with another person ..."). § 2423(b) is not such a statute. 
Federal court decisions watering down the "for the purpose of " requirement fly in the 
face of the two Supreme Court decisions addressing that element. See Hansen v. Huff, 291 U.S. 
559 (1934); Mortensen v. United States, 322 U.S. 369 (1944). Santos and Cuellar speak loudly 
and clearly against prosecutors seeing such elasticity in federal criminal statutes, including those 
enacted to protect important federal interests. In cases involving the federalization of activity 
that is within the States' historic police power, Congress must speak with particular clarity. See, 
e.g., Will v. Michigan Dep't of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 65 (1989).

KIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP 
Relevant Past Cases 
We have not been able to find a single federal prosecution based on facts like these—but 
have voluminous evidence of federal prosecutors routinely declining to bring charges in cases far 
more egregious than this one. To take just one obvious example, federal prosecutors have self-
consciously refrained from involvement in the literally dozens of sexual cases of former priests, 
opting instead to allow seasoned state prosecutors (like the ones in this case) to pursue the 
accused former clergymen. That is so despite (1) the large number of victims, (2) the vast 
geographic diversity of the cases, and (3) the fact that some of these cases involve allegations 
that the defendant forcibly molested, abused, or raped literally dozens of children—including 
some as young as five years old—over a period of years. Nonetheless, federal prosecutors have 
not hesitated to let their state counterparts pursue these cases free from federal interference—
even though the sentences meted out vary greatly on account of the fact that "[c]riminal penalties 
are specific to localities or jurisdictions."3 The facts of this case, which involve the solicitation 
of consensual topless massages and some sexual contact, entirely in the privacy of his home and 
almost entirely by women over the age of 18, pale in comparison to the outright sexual abuse and 
degradation of preteen minors in many of the priest cases. 
Nor does this case bear any of the hallmarks that typify the cases that federal prosecutors 
have pursued under the federal statutes at issue here. When asked, the closest case suggested by 
the prosecutors was United States v. Boehm—and it hardly could differ more from Mr. Epstein's 
case. In Boehm, the defendant was charged with conspiracy to distribute cocaine and cocaine 
base to minors, in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 846, 84I(a)(1), and 859(a); being a felon in 
possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(I); and sex trafficking of children in 
violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 371 and 1591. United States v. Boehm, Case No. 3:04CR00003 (11 
Alaska 2004). Boehm's actions, unlike Mr. Epstein's, also had a strong interstate nexus: Boehm 
purchased and distributed large quantities of crack cocaine and cocaine that traveled in interstate 
commerce, and he used his home and hotels (which were used by interstate travelers) to purchase 
drugs and distribute them to minors while also arranging for these minors to have sex with him 
and others. Indeed, Boehm not only (1) purchased cocaine in large quantities; (2) distributed the 
drugs to minors; (3) possessed illegal firearms; (4) and arranged for the minors to have sex with 
other members of the conspiracy in exchange for drugs; but (5) admitted to knowing the ages of 
the individuals involved.4 Here, by contrast, as previous stated, all of the conduct took place in 
Mr. Epstein's private home in Palm Beach; there was no for-profit enterprise; no interstate 
component; no use by Mr. Epstein of an instrumentality of interstate commerce; no violence; no 
force; no alcohol; no drugs; no guns; and no child pornography. 
See http://www.bishop-accountability.org/reports/2004_02_27 johnJay/2004_02_27_Terry_Johniay_3.htrn 
#cleric7. 
In fact, Boehm and his co-defendants distributed drugs to approximately 12 persons between the ages of 13 and 
21. Boehm also had a prior criminal history—and one that clearly showed he was a danger to society: he 
previously had been convicted of raping both a thirteen year-old girl and a fifteen year-old girl. (Day 7 of 
Sentencing hearing p. 32).

To the extent there is a similar, but more egregious, local Florida case on the books, it is 
that of Barry Kutun, a former North Miami city attorney accused of having sex with underage 
prostitutes and videotaping the sessions. Mr. Kutun pleaded guilty on May 18, 2007 in a Miami-
Dade County courtroom as part of an agreement with State prosecutors and he received five 
years probation and a withholding of adjudication with no requirement to register as a sex 
offender—all without a shred of involvement by federal prosecutors, who declined to prosecute 
him. Indeed, given the wide use of the telephone in today's society, it gives a rogue prosecutor 
carte blanche to turn any local crime into a federal offense. Given the federal government's 
decision to abstain from prosecuting that case, it is hard to understand how the federal 
prosecutors responsible for this case think that the State's treatment of Mr. Epstein somehow 
leaves federal interests substantially unvindicated. There is simply no basis for the federal 
prosecutors' disparate treatment of Mr. Epstein. 
Summary of the Evidence 
Finally, we wish to share new evidence—obtained through discovery in connection with 
the civil lawsuits filed in this matter—which confirms that further federal involvement in this 
matter would be inappropriate. This testimony taken to date categorically confirms that (i) Mr.

Conclusion 
Jeffrey Epstein, a self-made businessman with no prior criminal history, should not be 
prosecuted federally for conduct that amounts to, the solicitation of prostitution. A federal 
prosecution based on these facts would be an unprecedented exercise of federal power, a misuse 
of federal resources, and a prosecution that would carry with it the appearance, if not the reality, 
of unwarranted selectivity given the incongruity between the facts as developed in this matter 
and the factual paradigms for all other reported federal prosecutions under each of the three 
statutes being considered. It would require the pursuit of a novel legal theory never before 
sanctioned by federal law—and that indeed is inconsistent with each of the statutes prosecutors 
have identified. Accordingly, we respectfully request that you direct the U.S. Attorney's Office 
for the Southern District of Florida to discontinue its involvement in this matter, and return 
responsibility for this case to the State of Florida.
