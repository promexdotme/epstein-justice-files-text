21.58-cr (L), 21.770-cr 
United States v. Maxwell 
United States Court of Appeals 
FOR THE 
SECOND CIRCUIT 
At a stated term of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, held at the 
Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse, 40 Foley Square, in the City of New York, on the 
27'h day of April, two thousand twenty-one. 
PRESENT: 
PIERRE N. LEVAL, 
RAYMOND J. LOHIER, JR., 
RICHARD J. SULLIVAN, 
Circuit Judges. 
United States of America, 
Appellee, 
v. 
21-58-cr (L) 
21-770-cr 
Ghislaine Maxwell, AKA Sealed Defendant 1, 
Defendant-Appellant. 
Defendant-Appellant Ghislaine Maxwell appeals from orders of the District Court entered 
December 28, 2020 and March 22, 2021, which denied her renewed requests for bail pending trial. 
See Dkts. 1, 20. Upon due consideration, it is hereby ORDERED that the District Court's orders 
are AFFIRMED and that Appellant's motion for bail, or in the alternative, temporary pretrial 
release pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3142(i), Dkt. 39, is DENIED. During oral argument, counsel for 
Appellant expressed concern that Appellant was improperly being deprived of sleep while 
incarcerated. To the extent Appellant seeks relief specific to her sleeping conditions, such request 
should be addressed to the District Court. 
FOR THE COURT: 
Catherine O'Hagan Wolfe, Clerk of Court

Attached is the reply letter Maxwell's counsel filed in further support of her motion to stay 
case. 
Alarmingly, they come out and say that they believe she is one of the victims named in the indictment, teetering 
dangerously close to a violation of the protective order in our case. 
My plan is still to file our letter in support of a stay as is this evening. Please let me know if anyone would like to discuss

Subject: RE: Discovery Requests 
Date: Mon, 18 Jan 2021 03:04:48 +0000 
Inline-Images: image001.jpg; image002.jpg 
Chris, 
Below please find our responses. 
1. 
As we have recently discussed, Ms. Maxwell now has access to the 4TB drive containing a full set of the discovery 
produced to date. It took a significant amount of time to create this copy due to the volume of discovery and 
delays on the part of our vendor, who assisted in creating the copy. 
2. 
As we have recently discussed, Ms. Maxwell now has a drive containing the contents of the CD produced on 
November 18, 2020. 
3. 
As I conveyed to you over the phone and in a recent email, the materials produced from the Subject Devices all 
contain metadata indicating the "NYC" CART Evidence Number of the device from which each document was 
extracted. In our November 18, 2020 discovery letter, we provided you with a chart setting forth which "NYC" 
CART Evidence Number corresponds with which Subject Device in our warrants. If you still need a detailed index 
of all 1.2 million documents with the specific Subject Device indicated, please let me know, and I will ask one of 
our paralegals to compile one. 
4. 
We produced the FBI report bearing Bates number SDNY_GM_02050812-14 in the form in which it was 
recovered from one of Epstein's devices. In other words, we did not apply any redactions to that document; 
rather, the redactions existed on the document at the time the document was found during the FBI's search of 
Epstein's devices. We are not aware of any legal basis for your request for a log of redactions. If you have any 
legal authority on that point, we would be happy to consider it. As a courtesy, I will note that our office did not 
apply redactions to any material that was identified responsive during the searches of Epstein's devices. 
5. 
We are aware of our discovery obligations, have complied with them, and will continue to comply with them. We 
are not aware of any legal basis for your request that we inform you of what, if any, documents have been 
withheld or the basis for their withholding. If you have any legal authority on that point, we would be happy to 
consider it. As a courtesy, I will note that we have provided you with all records we received from AT&T and all 
records we received from David Rodgers. As to your inquiry about the Bates ranges on the Rodgers documents 
beginning with Bates number "28", I note that the folder containing the Rodgers subpoena returns in our August 
5, 2020 production included two documents. The first (SDNY_GM_00005532-5649) is the document you 
referenced in your email inquiry. The second (SDNY_GM_00005650-5676) is 27 pages long, accounting for the 
first 27 pages of the production from Rodgers. We produced those two documents in the form in which we 
received them. 
6. 
Our paralegals are working on the issues you identified with Bates ranges and metadata load files. I will reach 
back out to you once I have an update on the status of those issues. 
7. 
We do not have a more detailed index of the November 9 and November 18 productions beyond what we have 
provided to you. 
EFTA00023026
--- PAGE 2 ---
8. 
We are not aware of any legal basis for your request for copies of grand jury subpoenas. Nor are we aware of any 
legal basis for your request that we identify the date range of documents we requested in each subpoena. If you 
have any legal authority for those requests, we would be happy to consider it. 
9. 
The court filings that appear to be referenced in the Daily Beast article you sent are an application for a search 
warrant and a search warrant filed in the District of New Hampshire. We produced both documents to you in 
discovery on August 5, 2020. The DNH judge issued a sealing order in connection with the warrant and 
application. As you can see at Bates No. SDNY_GM_00000621, the sealing order automatically expired on 
December 30, 2020. Our understanding is that the District of New Hampshire unsealed the filing of its own 
accord in conformity with the clear language of that sealing order. Our office took no affirmative steps to unseal 
or otherwise release these filings. 
Best, 
Assistant United States Attorney 
Southern District of New York

Subject: Discovery Requests 
We write to raise a number of discovery issues. Please let us know your position on these issues at your earliest 
convenience. 
1. In our email correspondence on 11/18/2020, you agreed to create a new hard drive containing the entire discovery 
production. We provided you with a 4T8 hard drive for that purpose on 11/20/2020. It is very important for Ms. 
Maxwell to have this drive as soon as possible to prepare her defense. Do you have an update on when the drive 
will be ready? 
2. We also informed you that the CD produced on November 18, 2020 did not work on the prison computer at the 
MDC (as you know, the laptop provided to Ms. Maxwell does not have a CD drive). Accordingly, we asked you to 
include the material on the CD in the new 4TB hard drive. We followed-up with you about this issue on December 
30, 2020. Given that the new hard drive is still not ready, we ask that you download the material on the CD onto 
a separate thumb drive or hard drive and provide it as quickly as possible to Ms. Maxwell at the MDC so that she 
can review the materials this weekend. Alternatively, you can provide an external CD drive to Ms. Maxwell at 
the MDC so that she can read the files on the MDC computer. We will provide whatever media device you 
require to facilitate this production. 
EFTA00023027

3. Unlike the November 9, 2020 discovery cover letter, the November 18, 2020 discovery cover letter (attached) does 
not correlate the Bates numbers to the particular "Subject Device" from which the documents were recovered. 
Instead, the cover letter indicates that the documents came from "SDNY_PROD015" or "SDNY_PROD016." We do 
not know what those terms refer to. We request that the government produce a list that correlates the Bates 
numbers for all of the documents in SDNY_PROD015 and SDNY_PROD016 to the particular devices from which the 
documents were recovered. 
4. We request that the government provide an unredacted version of the FBI report, dated December 6, 2006, 
bearing Bates number SDNY_GM_02050812-14 (attached). We also request that the government produce a log 
identifying all of the redacted documents in the discovery and the bases for each of the redactions. 
5. There are a few documents that seem to be missing from the discovery. For example, the AT&T documents 
(SDNY_GM_00001015-3637) do not seem to include subscriber information for the various phone numbers. Also, 
the flight logs produced by David Rodgers begin at Bates number "Rodgers000028," suggesting that 
Rodgers000001-000027 were not produced to us. Please produce these documents to us or provide an 
explanation why you are not producing them to us. Please confirm whether there are other documents that were 
removed from the grand jury subpoena productions that we have not yet identified and the basis for their removal. 
6. There are a few Bates number/metadata issues with some of the documents: 
a. There is an overlap between the fourth and fifth document productions. The fourth production ends at 
SDNY_GM_00328863, the fifth production begins at SDNY_GM_00328070. We propose renumbering the 
range from the fifth production (i.e., renumber SDNYGM_00328070-328863). 
b. The metadata load files (*.DAT) for PROD011 had a number of gaps which are detailed in the attached Excel 
file. We propose that you send us a new DAT file covering only the missing documents. 
c. The metadata load files (*.DAT) for PROD015 had a gap from SDNYGM_00723971 to SDNY_GM_00723981. 
We propose that you send us a new DAT file covering only the missing documents. 
7. To the extent that the government has created an index of the documents produced on November 9 and 
November 18 that is more detailed than the production cover letters, we request that you provide a copy to the 
defense. 
8. We request that the government provide copies of the grand jury subpoenas for documents issued by the 
government in this case. Also, please identify the date range of documents you requested in each subpoena. 
There is one other issue we'd like to raise. An article in the Daily Beast on Monday referenced the search warrant affidavit 
for the cell-site simulator used to track Ms. Maxwell's cellphone before her arrest (https://www.thedailybeast.comThow-
the-fbi-tracked-down-ghislaine-maxwell-alleged-madam-of-jeffrey-epstein). The article stated that the affidavit appeared 
in a "newly unsealed court filing." I don't recall this affidavit being unsealed or referenced in anything that was filed on 
the court docket. Please confirm whether or not the government unsealed this affidavit or any other materials from the 
criminal discovery, and whether any discovery materials were released pursuant to FOIA requests.

Date: Tue, 23 Jul 2019 21:49:57 +0000 
Dear Sirs 
A 2019 documentary, currently being shown on Netflix Canada, entitled The Disappearance of 
Madeleine McCann, is about the four year old English girl who disappeared from Portugal in 2007 
while on holiday with her parents and siblings. She has never been found. 
In Series 1, episode 3, Portuguese journalists refer to a scandal that took place years earlier regarding 
child abuse in a Portuguese orphanage. It is referred to as the Pact of Silence. In connection with the 
orphanage, Casa Pia, a journalist states that it is a known fact that American millionaires were 
flying into Portugal on private jets for the purpose of sexually abusing these children. 
This might be a line of enquiry that you may wish to follow up. 
Yours truly,

Hey= 
Sounds good on those names. We will get this done after pushing out the 3500. 
In looking at the FedEx documents we are pretty confident that they were never produced in discovery. I've downloaded 
and stamped them and drafted a cover letter (attached). Should these materials be stamped with the same text that 
sent previously ("SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER PARAGRAPHS 7,8, 9, 10, 15, and 17")? If so, I'll add it to each 
of them. 
There are also a number of additional materials that are saved in a pending production folder here: 
Wilsa.doj.gov\clowANYS\StAndrews‘Shared‘USvEpstein-2018R01618\Discovery‘GM\27 Eighteenth Production (2021-07-
xx) 
Are these materials good to be stamped as well or should we just produce the FedEx materials and wait on the rest?

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE 
OFFICE OF 
PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF REPORT 
Investigation into the 
U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida's 
Resolution of Its 2006-2008 Federal Criminal Investigation of 
Jeffrey Epstein and Its Interactions with Victims during the Investigation 
November 2020 
EFTA00023060
--- PAGE 3 ---
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
The Department of Justice (Department) Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) 
investigated allegations that in 2007-2008, prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the 
Southern District of Florida (USAO) improperly resolved a federal investigation into the criminal 
conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by negotiating and executing a federal non-prosecution agreement 
(NPA). The NPA was intended to end a federal investigation into allegations that Epstein engaged 
in illegal sexual activity with girls.' OPR also investigated whether USAO prosecutors committed 
professional misconduct by failing to consult with victims of Epstein's crimes before the NPA was 
signed or by misleading victims regarding the status of the federal investigation after the signing. 
I. 
OVERVIEW OF FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
The Palm Beach (Florida) Police Department (PBPD) began investigating Jeffrey Epstein 
in 2005, after the parents of a 14-year-old girl complained that Epstein had paid her for a massage. 
Epstein was a multi-millionaire financier with residences in Palm Beach, New York City, and 
other United States and foreign locations. The investigation led to the discovery that Epstein used 
personal assistants to recruit girls to provide massages to him, and in many instances, those 
massages led to sexual activity. After the PBPD brought the case to the State Attorney's Office, a 
Palm Beach County grand jury indicted Epstein, on July 19, 2006, for felony solicitation of 
prostitution in violation of Florida Statute § 796.07. However, because the PBPD Chief and the 
lead Detective were dissatisfied with the State Attorney's handling of the case and believed that 
the state grand jury's charge did not address the totality of Epstein's conduct, they referred the 
matter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in West Palm Beach for a possible federal 
investigation. 
The FBI brought the matter to an Assistant U.S. Attorney (AUSA), who opened a file with 
her supervisor's approval and with the knowledge of then U.S. Attorney R. Alexander Acosta. 
She worked with two FBI case agents to develop a federal case against Epstein and, in the course 
of the investigation, they discovered additional victims. In May 2007, the AUSA submitted to her 
supervisors a draft 60-count indictment outlining charges against Epstein. She also provided a 
lengthy memorandum summarizing the evidence she had assembled in support of the charges and 
addressing the legal issues related to the proposed charges. 
For several weeks following submission of the prosecution memorandum and proposed 
indictment, the AUSA's supervisors reviewed the case to determine how to proceed. At a July 31, 
2007 meeting with Epstein's attorneys, the USAO offered to end its investigation if Epstein pled 
guilty to state charges, agreed to serve a minimum of two years' incarceration, registered as a 
sexual offender, and agreed to a mechanism through which victims could obtain monetary 
damages. The USAO subsequently engaged in additional meetings and communications with 
Epstein's team of attorneys, ultimately negotiating the terms of a state-based resolution of the 
federal investigation, which culminated in the signing of the NPA on September 24, 2007. The 
As used in this Report, including in quoted documents and statements, the word "girls" refers to females who 
were under the age of 18 at the time of the alleged conduct. Under Florida law, a minor is a person under the age 
of 18. 
EFTA00023061
--- PAGE 4 ---
NPA required Epstein to plead guilty in state court to the then-pending state indictment against 
him and to an additional criminal information charging him with a state offense that would require 
him to register as a sexual offender—specifically, procurement of minors to engage in prostitution, 
in violation of Florida Statute § 796.03. 
The NPA required Epstein to make a binding 
recommendation that the state court sentence him to serve 18 months in the county jail followed 
by 12 months of community control (home detention or "house arrest"). The NPA also included 
provisions designed to facilitate the victims' recovery of monetary damages from Epstein. In 
exchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in 
the Southern District of Florida of him, four named co-conspirators, and "any potential 
co-conspirators." Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state resolution or 
the NPA prior to its signing. 
The signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to Epstein's guilty plea and incarceration, 
however. For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his extensive team of prominent attorneys 
to try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously 
seeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no 
federal interest at issue and the matter should be left to the discretion of state law enforcement 
officials. Through repeated communications with the USAO and senior Department officials, 
defense counsel fought the government's interpretation of the NPA's terms. They also sought and 
obtained review by the Department's Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Attorney 
General, primarily on the issue of federal jurisdiction over what the defense insisted was "a 
quintessentially state matter." After reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO, on 
June 23, 2008, the Office of the Deputy Attorney General informed defense counsel that the 
Deputy Attorney General would not intervene in the matter. Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill 
his obligation under the NPA, and on June 30, 2008, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to 
the pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA, 
to a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution. 
Upon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the 
court immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of 12 months' incarceration on the 
solicitation charge and 6 months' incarceration on the procurement charge, followed by 12 months 
of community control. Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm 
Beach County facility. A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court. 
On July 7, 2008, a victim, identified as "Jane Doe," filed in federal court in the Southern 
District of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated the Crime Victims' 
Rights Act (CVRA), 18 U.S.C. § 3771, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein 
without consulting with victims, and seeking enforcement of her CVRA rights.2 In responding to 
the petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did 
not produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a protective 
order; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court. After the initial filings and 
hearings, the CVRA case was dormant for almost two years while the petitioners pursued civil 
cases against Epstein. 
Emergency Victim's Petition for Enforcement of Crime Victim's [sic] Rights Act, 18 U.S.C. Section 3771, 
Doe v. United States, Case No. 9:08-cv-80736-1CAM (S.D. Fla. July 7, 2008). Another victim subsequently joined 
the litigation as "Jane Doe 2." 
EFTA00023062
--- PAGE 5 ---
Soon after he was incarcerated, Epstein applied for the Palm Beach County Sheriff's work 
release program, and the Sheriff approved his application. In October 2008, Epstein began 
spending 12 hours a day purportedly working at the "Florida Science Foundation," an entity 
Epstein had recently incorporated that was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of 
Epstein's attorneys. Although the NPA specified a term of incarceration of 18 months, Epstein 
received "gain time," that is, time off for good behavior, and he actually served less than 13 months 
of incarceration. On July 22, 2009, Epstein was released from custody to a one-year term of home 
detention as a condition of community control, and he registered as a sexual offender with the 
Florida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and news media filed suit in Florida courts 
for release of the copy of the NPA that had been filed under seal in the state court file, a state judge 
in September 2009 ordered it to be made public. 
By mid-2010, Epstein reportedly settled multiple civil lawsuits brought against him by 
victims seeking monetary damages, including the two petitioners in the CVRA litigation. During 
the CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which made substantial 
document productions, filed lengthy privilege logs in support of its withholding of documents, and 
submitted declarations from the AUSA and the FBI case agents who conducted the federal 
investigation. The USAO opposed efforts to unseal various records, as did Epstein, who was 
permitted to intervene in the litigation with respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court 
ultimately ordered that substantial records relating to the USAO's resolution of the Epstein case 
be made public. During the course of the litigation, the court made numerous rulings interpreting 
the CVRA. After failed efforts to settle the case, the parties' cross motions for summary judgment 
remained pending for more than a year. 
In 2017, President Donald Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his 
March 2017 confirmation hearing, Acosta was questioned only briefly about the Epstein case. On 
April 17, 2017, the Senate confirmed Acosta's appointment as Labor Secretary. 
In the decade following his release from incarceration, Epstein reportedly continued to 
settle multiple civil suits brought by many, but not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise able 
to resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the press. On November 28, 2018, 
however, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about state and federal 
criminal investigations initiated more than 12 years earlier into allegations that Epstein had coerced 
girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.; The Miami Herald 
reported that in 2007, Acosta entered into an "extraordinary" deal with Epstein in the form of the 
NPA, which permitted Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison 
sentence by pleading guilty in state court to "two prostitution charges." According to the Miami 
Herald, the government also immunized from prosecution Epstein's co-conspirators and 
concealed from Epstein's victims the terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which included 
interviews of eight victims and information from publicly available documents, the newspaper 
painted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who had ignored serious criminal conduct by a 
wealthy man with powerful and politically connected friends by granting him a "deal of a lifetime" 
that allowed him both to escape significant punishment for his past conduct and to continue his

abuse of minors. The Miami Herald report led to public outrage and media scrutiny of the 
government's actions.' 
On February 21, 2019, the district court granted the CVRA case petitioners' Motion for 
Partial Summary Judgment, ruling that the government violated the CVRA in failing to advise the 
victims about its intention to enter into the NPA.5 The court also found that letters the government 
sent to victims after the NPA was signed, describing the investigation as ongoing, "mislead [sic] 
the victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility." The court also highlighted 
the inequity of the USAO's failure to communicate with the victims while at the same time 
engaging in "lengthy negotiations" with Epstein's counsel and assuring the defense that the NPA 
would not be "made public or filed with the court." The court ordered the parties to submit 
additional briefs regarding the appropriate remedies. After the court's order, the Department 
recused the USAO from the CVRA litigation and assigned the U.S. Attorney's Office for the 
Northern District of Georgia to handle the case for the government. Among the remedies sought 
by the petitioners, and opposed by the government, was rescission of the NPA and federal 
prosecution of Epstein. 
On July 2, 2019, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York obtained 
a federal grand jury indictment charging Epstein with one count of sex trafficking of minors and 
one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors. The indictment alleged that from 
2002 until 2005, Epstein created a vast network of underage victims in both New York and Florida 
whom he sexually abused and exploited. Epstein was arrested on the charges on July 6, 2019. In 
arguing for Epstein's pretrial detention, prosecutors asserted that agents searching Epstein's 
Manhattan residence found thousands of photos of nude and half-nude females, including at least 
one believed to be a minor. The court ordered Epstein detained pending trial, and he was remanded 
to the custody of the Bureau of Prisons and held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in 
Manhattan. 
Meanwhile, after publication of the November 2018 Miami Herald report, the media and 
Congress increasingly focused attention on Acosta as the government official responsible for the 
NPA. On July 10, 2019, Acosta held a televised press conference to defend his and the USAO's 
actions. Acosta stated that the Palm Beach State Attorney's Office "was ready to allow Epstein to 
walk free with no jail time, nothing." According to Acosta, because USAO prosecutors considered 
this outcome unacceptable, his office pursued a difficult and challenging case and obtained a 
resolution that put Epstein in jail, forced him to register as a sexual offender, and provided victims 
with the means to obtain monetary damages. 
Acosta's press conference did not end the 
controversy, however, and on July 12, 2019, Acosta submitted to the President his resignation as

Secretary of Labor. In a brief oral statement, Acosta explained that continued media attention on 
his handling of the Epstein investigation rather than on the economy was unfair to the Labor 
Department. 
On August 10, 2019, Epstein was found hanging in his cell and was later pronounced dead. 
The New York City Chief Medical Examiner concluded that Epstein had committed suicide. 
As a result of Epstein's death, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of 
New York filed a nolle prosequi to dismiss the pending indictment against Epstein. On 
August 27, 2019, the district court held a hearing at which more than a dozen of Epstein's 
victims—including victims of the conduct in Florida that was addressed through the NPA—spoke 
about the impact of Epstein's crimes. 
The court dismissed the Epstein indictment on 
August 29, 2019. 
After Epstein's death, the federal district court in Florida overseeing the CVRA litigation 
denied the petitioners their requested remedies and closed the case as moot. Among its findings, 
the court concluded that although the government had violated the CVRA, the government had 
asserted "legitimate and legally supportable positions throughout this litigation," and therefore had 
not litigated in bad faith. The court also noted it expected the government to "honor its 
representation that it will provide training to its employees about the CVRA and the proper 
treatment of crime victims," as well as honoring its promise to meet with the victims. 
On September 30, 2019, CVRA petitioner "Jane Doe 1" filed in her true name a petition 
for a writ of mandamus in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, seeking 
review of the district court's order denying all of her requested remedies. In its responsive brief, 
the government argued that "as a matter of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not attach 
prior to the government charging a case" and thus, "the CVRA was not triggered in [the Southern 
District of Florida] because no criminal charges were brought." Nevertheless, during oral 
argument, the government conceded that the USAO had not been "fully transparent" with the 
petitioner and had "made a mistake in causing her to believe that the case was ongoing when in 
fact the NPA had been signed." On April 14, 2020, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals denied 
the petition, ruling that CVRA rights do not attach until a defendant has been criminally charged. 
On August 7, 2020, the court granted the petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel's 
opinion; as of the date of this Report, a briefing schedule has been issued, and oral argument is set 
for December 3, 2020. 
II. 
THE INITIATION AND SCOPE OF OPR'S INVESTIGATION 
After the Miami Herald published its investigative report on November 28, 2018, 
U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Oversight, Agency 
Action, Federal Rights and Federal Courts, sent a December 3, 2018 letter to OPR, citing the Miami 
Herald's report and requesting that OPR "open an investigation into the instances identified in this 
reporting of possible misconduct by Department of Justice attorneys." On February 6, 2019, the 
Department of Justice Office of Legislative Affairs advised Senator Sasse that OPR had opened 
EFTA00023065
--- PAGE 8 ---
an investigation into the matter and would review the USAO's decision to resolve the federal 
investigation of Epstein through the NPA.6
After the district court issued its ruling in the CVRA litigation, on February 21, 2019, OPR 
included within the scope of its investigation an examination of the government's conduct that 
formed the basis for the court's findings that the USAO violated the CVRA in failing to afford 
victims a reasonable right to confer with the government about the NPA before the agreement was 
signed and that the government affirmatively misled victims about the status of the federal 
investigation. 
During the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands 
of records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department components, including the Office of 
the Deputy Attorney General, the Criminal Division, and the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys. 
The records included emails, letters, memoranda, and investigative materials. OPR also collected 
and reviewed materials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein. OPR also 
examined extensive publicly available information, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and 
other court records, and reviewed media reports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books 
relating to the Epstein case. 
In addition to this extensive documentary review, OPR conducted more than 60 interviews 
of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI administrative personnel; 
current and former USAO staff and attorneys; current and former Department attorneys and senior 
managers, including a former Deputy Attorney General and a former Assistant Attorney General 
for the Criminal Division; and the former State Attorney and former Assistant State Attorney in 
charge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed several victims and attorneys 
representing victims, and reviewed written submissions from victims, concerning victim contacts 
with the USAO and the FBI. 
OPR identified former U.S. Attorney Acosta, three former USAO supervisors, and the 
AUSA as subjects of its investigation based on preliminary information indicating that each of 
them was involved in the decision to resolve the case through the NPA or in the negotiations 
leading to the agreement. OPR deems a current or former Department attorney to be a subject of 
its investigation when the individual's conduct is within the scope of OPR's review and may result 
in a finding of professional misconduct. OPR reviewed prior public statements made by Acosta 
and another subject. All five subjects cooperated fully with OPR's investigation. OPR requested 
that all of the subjects provide written responses detailing their involvement in the federal 
investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and decisions relating to victim 
notification and consultation. OPR received and reviewed written responses from all of the 
subjects, and subsequently conducted extensive interviews of each subject under oath and before 
a court reporter. 
Each subject was represented by counsel and had access to relevant 
contemporaneous documents before the subject's OPR interview. The subjects reviewed and 
provided comments on their respective interview transcripts and on OPR's draft report. OPR 
The federal government was closed from December 22, 2018, to January 25, 2019. After initiating its 
investigation, OPR also subsequently received other letters from U.S. Senators and Representatives inquiring into the 
status of the OPR investigation. 
vi 
EFTA00023066
--- PAGE 9 ---
carefully considered the comments and made changes, or noted comments, as OPR deemed 
appropriate; OPR did not, however, alter its findings and conclusions. 
Finally, OPR reviewed relevant case law, statutes, regulations, Department policy, and 
attorney professional responsibility rules as necessary to resolve the issues presented in this case 
and to determine whether the subjects committed professional misconduct. 
As part of its investigation, OPR examined the interactions between state officials and the 
federal investigators and prosecutors, but because OPR does not have jurisdiction over state 
officials, OPR did not investigate, or reach conclusions about, their conduct regarding the state 
investigation.' Because OPR's mission is to ensure that Department attorneys adhere to the 
standards of professional conduct, OPR's investigation focused on the actions of the subject 
attorneys rather than on determining the full scope of Epstein's and his assistants' criminal 
behavior. Accordingly, OPR considered the evidence and information regarding Epstein's and his 
assistants' conduct as it was known to the subjects at the time they performed their duties as 
Department attorneys. Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 30, 2008, 
when Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA, did not affect the subjects' actions prior to 
that date, and OPR did not evaluate the subjects' conduct on the basis of that subsequent 
information. 
OPR's investigation occurred approximately 12 years after most of the significant events 
relating to the USAO's investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and Epstein's guilty plea. As a result, 
many of the subjects and witnesses were unable to recall the details of events or their own or 
others' actions occurring in 2006-2008, such as conversations, meetings, or documents they 
reviewed at the times However, OPR's evaluation of the subjects' conduct was aided significantly 
by extensive, contemporaneous emails among the prosecutors and communications between the 
government and defense counsel. These records often referred to the interactions among the 
participants and described important decisions and, in some instances, the bases for them. 
III. 
OVERVIEW OF OPR'S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK 
OPR's primary mission is to ensure that Department attorneys perform their duties in 
accordance with the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation's principal 
law enforcement agency. Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct 
against current or former Department attorneys related to the exercise of their authority to 
In August 2019, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced that he had directed the Florida Department of 
Law Enforcement to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities relating to Epstein. As reported, the 
investigation focuses on Epstein's state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work release program. 
OPR was cognizant that Acosta and the three managers all left the USAO during, or not long after resolution 
of, the Epstein case, while the AUSA remained with the USAO until mid-2019. Moreover, as the line prosecutor in 
the Epstein investigation and also as co-counsel in the CVRA litigation until the USAO was recused from that 
litigation in early 2019, the AUSA had continuous access to the USAO documentary record and numerous occasions 
to review these materials in the course of her official duties. Additionally, in responding to OPR's request for a written 
response, and in preparing to be interviewed by OPR, the AUSA was able to refresh her recollection with these 
materials to an extent not possible for the other subjects, who were provided with relevant documents by OPR in 
preparation for their interviews. 
vii 
EFTA00023067
--- PAGE 10 ---
investigate, litigate, or provide legal advice.9 OPR also has jurisdiction to investigate allegations 
of misconduct against Department law enforcement agents when they relate to a Department 
attorney's alleged professional misconduct. 
In its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs 
the challenged conduct and whether a subject attorney violated that standard. Department 
attorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of 
their duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by attorney 
licensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it 
concludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject attorney violated such a standard 
intentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR's analytical framework, when OPR concludes that 
(1) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not 
intentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the 
subject's conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude 
that a subject attorney's conduct does not satisfy the elements necessary for a professional 
misconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may 
conclude that a subject attorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted 
inappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subject attorney's 
conduct was appropriate under the circumstances.10
IV. 
ISSUES CONSIDERED 
In this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to 
the negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO's 
interactions with Epstein's victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets 
of issues are described below and are analyzed separately in this Report. 
A. 
The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA 
In evaluating whether any of the subjects committed professional misconduct, OPR 
considered whether any of the NPA's provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute, 
professional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR 
considered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (1) charging decisions, (2) declination 
of criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants 
C.F.R. § 0.39a(aX I). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of attorneys occurring 
during their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the attorney left the Department before or during 
OPR's investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department 
attorneys. Although former Department attorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR's determination that 
a former Department attorney violated state rules of professional conduct for attorneys could result in a referral to an 
appropriate state attorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct 
of Department attorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases. 
In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after 
a preliminary inquiry into the matter. In December 2010, one of the attorneys representing victims in the CVRA 
litigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation 
and that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstein's crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its 
standard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation into those allegations at that time in deference to the 
then-pending CVRA litigation. 
viii 
EFTA00023068
--- PAGE 11 ---
of immunity, or (6) the deportation of criminal aliens. The potentially applicable standards that 
OPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report. OPR 
also examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter 
into the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive, 
such as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and 
discusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed 
that shed additional light on the USAO's handling of the Epstein investigation. 
B. 
The District Court's Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA 
To address the district court's adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content, 
and timing of the government's interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was 
signed, including victim notification letters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews 
conducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject attorneys violated any clear 
and unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the 
government's lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the 
circumstances relating to the district court's finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein's 
victims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed. 
V. 
OPR'S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS 
OPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in 
various decisions and events. Acosta, however, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal 
investigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of 
the initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led 
to the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved 
it, with knowledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknowledged that he approved 
the NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for 
the NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta's overall 
responsibility for the government's interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less 
clear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR 
evaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions. 
A. 
Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA 
With respect to all five subjects of OPR's investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects 
did not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and 
approval of the NPA. Under OPR's framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a 
subject attorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing 
the conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict 
Epstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state. 
Furthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable 
standards. 
As the U.S. Attorney, Acosta had the "plenary authority" under established federal law and 
Department policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his 
decision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta's decision to decline to 
initiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not 
ix 
EFTA00023069
--- PAGE 12 ---
find evidence that his decision was based on corruption or other impermissible considerations, 
such as Epstein's wealth, status, or associations. Evidence shows that Acosta resisted defense 
efforts to have the matter returned to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed 
appropriate, and he refused to eliminate the incarceration and sexual offender registration 
requirements. OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta's "breakfast meeting" with one 
of Epstein's defense counsel in October 2007 led to the NPA, which had been signed weeks earlier, 
or to any other significant decision that benefited Epstein. The contemporaneous records show 
that USAO managers' concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and the impact of a trial on 
the victims led them to prefer a pre-charge resolution and that Acosta's concerns about the proper 
role of the federal government in prosecuting solicitation crimes resulted in his preference for a 
state-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR does not find that Acosta engaged in professional 
misconduct by resolving the federal investigation of Epstein in the way he did or that the other 
subjects committed professional misconduct through their implementation of Acosta's decisions. 
Nevertheless, OPR concludes that Acosta's decision to resolve the federal investigation 
through the NPA constitutes poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of 
Acosta's broad discretion and OPR does not find that it resulted from improper factors, the NPA 
was a flawed mechanism for satisfying the federal interest that caused the government to open its 
investigation of Epstein. In Acosta's view, the federal government's role in prosecuting Epstein 
was limited by principles of federalism, under which the independent authority of the state should 
be recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was to serve as a "backstop" to state 
authorities by encouraging them to do more. However, Acosta failed to consider the difficulties 
inherent in a resolution that relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had 
no authority; he resolved the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were 
completed; and he agreed to several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the 
consideration required under the circumstances. In sum, Acosta's application of federalism 
principles was too expansive, his view of the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein was too 
narrow, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect to justify the decision to use 
the NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant role in reviewing and drafting the 
NPA and the other three subjects who were supervisors left the USAO, were transitioning to other 
jobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured more effective coordination 
and communication during the negotiations and before approving the final NPA. The NPA was a 
unique resolution, and one that required greater oversight and supervision than Acosta provided. 
B. 
Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Government's Interactions with 
Victims 
OPR further concludes that none of the subject attorneys committed professional 
misconduct with respect to the government's interactions with victims. The subjects did not have 
a clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA to consult with victims before entering into the 
NPA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without a federal criminal 
charge. Significantly, at the time the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA 
rights to attach unless and until federal charges had been filed, and the federal courts had not 
established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges were 
brought. In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the lack of consultation was for the purpose 
of silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part of a series of government 
interactions with victims that ultimately led to public and court condemnation of the government's 
EFTA00023070
--- PAGE 13 ---
treatment of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as a whole, and is contradictory to the 
Department's mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of a crime endure. 
OPR determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications sent to 
certain victims after the NPA was signed that described the case as "under investigation" and that 
failed to inform them of the NPA. The letters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who 
was not directly involved in the investigation, incorporated standard form language used by the 
FBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed by the subjects. 
Moreover, the statement that the matter was "under investigation" was not false because the 
government in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein would not fulfill 
the terms of the NPA. However, the letters risked misleading the victims and contributed to victim 
frustration and confusion by failing to provide important information about the status of the 
investigation. The letters also demonstrated a lack of coordination between the federal agencies 
responsible for communicating with Epstein's victims and showed a lack of attention to and 
oversight regarding communication with victims. 
After the NPA was signed, Acosta elected to defer to the State Attorney the decision 
whether to notify victims about the state's plea hearing pursuant to the state's own victim's rights 
requirements. Although Acosta's decision was within his authority and did not constitute 
professional misconduct, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he failed to 
make certain that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal 
investigation about the state plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important 
proceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had 
communicated with victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the 
Department intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were 
made aware of a court proceeding that was related to their own cases, and thus he failed to ensure 
that victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity. 
OPR concludes that the decision to postpone notifying victims about the terms of the NPA 
after it was signed and the omission of information about the NPA during victim interviews and 
conversations with victims' attorneys in 2008 do not constitute professional misconduct. 
Contemporaneous records show that these actions were based on strategic concerns about creating 
impeachment evidence that Epstein's victims had financial motives to make claims against him, 
evidence that could be used against victims at a trial, and were not for the purpose of silencing 
victims. Nonetheless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior to interviews of victims and 
discussions with victims' attorneys occurring in 2008 led to interactions that contributed to 
victims' feelings that the government was intentionally concealing information from them. 
After examining the full scope and context of the government's interactions with victims, 
OPR concludes that the government's lack of transparency and its inconsistent messages led to 
victims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the 
misimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein's counsel to keep the NPA secret 
from the victims; and undercut public confidence in the legitimacy of the resulting agreement. The 
overall result of the subjects' anomalous handling of this case understandably left many victims 
feeling ignored and frustrated and resulted in extensive public criticism. In sum, OPR concludes 
that the victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by the 
Department.

VI. 
ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT 
The Report is divided into three chapters. In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant 
federal, state, and local law enforcement entities involved in investigating Epstein's criminal 
conduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question. 
OPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense attorneys who interacted with 
the subjects. 
In Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an extensive account of events relating to the federal 
investigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2005 by a young 
victim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law 
enforcement authorities—and continues through the mid-2006 opening of the federal 
investigation; the September 2007 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein's subsequent 
efforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein's June 2008 
guilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein's compliance with 
the terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July 
2010. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations 
relating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA. OPR 
describes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects' 
conduct. 
Chapter Three concerns the government's interactions with victims and the district court's 
findings regarding the CVRA. OPR describes the relevant events and analyzes the subjects' 
conduct in light of the pertinent standards. 
OPR sets forth the extensive factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including 
internal USAO and Department communications, because doing so is necessary for a full 
understanding of the subjects' actions and of the bases for OPR's conclusions.

Hey everyone: Here's the latest draft of our letter and declaration on this issue. We are still 
confirming a few things, but they shouldn't impact the substance of the Maxwell discussion. There is 
also a chance that there's a separate declaration from the MDC; if there is, it should contain the same

Our response is due tomorrow. I'm generally around later this evening or tomorrow if there's 
anything you'd like to discuss.

Subject: RE: Disparities in Counsel and Discovery Access for Ghislaine Maxwell and Justin Rivera 
We are in the process of finalizing our response to the Maxwell/Rivera issue. We intend to 
explain that the discovery and counsel access accommodations that have been provided to Maxwell 
and Rivera, respectively, result from the specific circumstances of their cases, the specific requests of 
their lawyers, and their individual housing circumstances. On all of these factors, there are several 
important differences, including: 
- 
The Maxwell case has multiple times more discovery than the Rivera case. Hence, the need 
for such expanded discovery access is greater in the Maxwell case. 
At the MDC, Maxwell has a unique housing situation, as she is in protective custody outside 
the general population. She therefore has sole access to a room to use a computer and phone 
for approximately 13 hours a day. Rivera, by contrast, is housed in the general population. 
There are approximately 8o other inmates at the MCC in Rivera's unit that use the same VTC 
mom for court appearances, probation interviews, and attorney meetings. By contrast, 
Maxwell shares access to the MDC VTC room with substantially fewer inmates. The MDC can 
EFTA00023075
--- PAGE 3 ---
therefore provide 15 hours of VTC meetings with her attorneys without compromising access 
for other MDC inmates. The same is not true for Rivera at the MCC. 
Going forward, even though Rivera's counsel have asked (and the Court has ordered) that Rivera 
receive three hours of laptop access each day, the MCC is now leaving the laptop with him all day 
long, and only takes it back at night to charge it. Therefore, the MCC is now providing the same 
amount of electronic discovery access to Rivera that Maxwell receives at the MDC. 
As for providing Rivera with up to 15 hours of VTC access, we will explain that doing so will 
compromise access for other inmates. If defense counsel expresses a need for additional time, the 
MCC will continue to find ways to accommodate those requests as best as they can. 
Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss this further. 
Best,

Thanks, 
. Can you keep me posted on what we think will be the substance of the draft declaration when you 
know (that is, before we are submitting anything on 12/31)? And how much of this is attributable to differences 
between MCC and MDC, as well as specific differences in their housing situations?

Subject: Disparities in Counsel and Discovery Access for Ghislaine Maxwell and Justin Rivera 
All: 
I wanted to bring to your attention a recent issue that's surfaced in United States v. Rivera et al., a 
sex trafficking case pending before Judge Engelmayer. As I'll describe in more detail below, Judge 
Engelmayer has asked us to submit a declaration from the BOP explaining why the discovery and 
counsel access accommodations provided to Ghislaine Maxwell (detained at the MDC outside the 
general population) cannot be extended to Justin Rivera (detained at the MCC in the general 
population). 
EFTA00023076
--- PAGE 4 ---
Justin Rivera was charged in February 2019 with sex trafficking conspiracy. He's been detained at 
the MCC since April 2019 on consent (he's also serving a state sentence). His trial, which was 
originally scheduled for April 2019, is expected to start on February 16, 2020. In July 2020, he had 
new counsel appointed, citing an irreconcilable breakdown with his former counsel. 
Since this fall, Judge Engelmayer has become increasingly frustrated with the MCC's treatment of 
Rivera. In particular, he's cited their failure to provide Rivera with adequate accommodations to 
review discovery and meet with his lawyers, who refuse to visit Rivera at the MCC for personal health 
concerns. We have two court orders in place to address these issues: (0 a laptop order, which 
requires the MCC to provide Rivera access to a laptop for three hours per day; and (2) a 
videoconference order, which requires the MCC to make available four hours of videoconferencing 
each week, in addition to any telephone or videoconference calls obtained through the Federal 
Defenders. 
At the moment, there's not a concern, at least from Judge Engelmayer, that the amount of time 
Rivera has for videoconferences and electronic discovery review is insufficient for trial preparation, 
although defense counsel has stated that they may request more time in the future. However, in a 
letter last night and during a court conference this morning (transcript attached), defense counsel 
cited the accommodations that the MDC has provided to Maxwell, describing them as "strikingly 
different and far superior" to those afforded to Rivera. Defense counsel further suggested that Rivera 
was being treated differently on account of his race, gender and class. Judge Engelmayer stated that 
the disparity in access "jumped off the page" and that the optics were "terrible," and asked us to 
e lain the rationale for the differing treatment. After conferring with 
and 
before our conference, we explained our understanding that the disparity comes down to 
the fact that Maxwell and Rivera have very different housing situations, with Maxwell's situation 
being more amenable to greater access to electronic discovery review and legal visits. 
Judge Engelmayer asked us to submit a declaration, from an appropriate person at the BOP, 
explaining in more detail why the accommodations provided to Maxwell cannot be extended to 
Rivera. Based on the recent bail opposition in the Maxwell case, I believe the differences in 
counsel/discovery access are as follows: 
Accommodation 
Maxwell 
Rivera 
Review of electronic 
discovery (NB: each 
defendant has laptop access) 
hours per day/7 days per 
week (91 hours total) 
hours per day/7 days per 
week (21 hours total) 
Counsel visits (by video) 
hours per day/5 days per 
week (15 hours total) 
Four hours per week (plus an 
additional two hours 
scheduled through the 
Federal Defenders) (6 hours 
total) 
Weekend legal calls 
As needed 
Not available 
The declaration is due by December 31. Because Judge Engelmayer's request implicates at least two 
criminal cases, and potentially the ongoing civil litigation with the MCC, we wanted to make sure that 
you were all aware of this issue. We are also ha 
to set up a call to discuss this further. In the 
meantime, we are working with 
to identify the appropriate declarant and draft an 
explanation for the Court.

Apologies — I looked at this as soon as you sent it, but apparently my outlook was frozen and it was hanging in

Hi 
Please see our proposed letter, which I understand you would like to review, as well as 
declarations from associate wardens at the MDC and MCC. The GC and PC chiefs have signed off on 
these drafts. 
With apologies for the time sensitivity, our contacts at MCC/MDC have asked to leave early today 
(before 1/1:30), and have asked us to finalize the declarations as soon as possible. 
Best,

Subject: RE: Disparities in Counsel and Discovery Access for Ghislaine Maxwell and Justin Rivera 
: We are in the process of finalizing our response to the Maxwell/Rivera issue. We intend to 
explain that the discovery and counsel access accommodations that have been provided to Maxwell 
and Rivera, respectively, result from the specific circumstances of their cases, the specific requests of 
their lawyers, and their individual housing circumstances. On all of these factors, there are several 
important differences, including: 
- 
The Maxwell case has multiple times more discovery than the Rivera case. Hence, the need for 
such expanded discovery access is greater in the Maxwell case. 
At the MDC, Maxwell has a unique housing situation, as she is in protective custody outside the 
general population. She therefore has sole access to a room to use a computer and phone for 
approximately 13 hours a day. Rivera, by contrast, is housed in the general population. 
There are approximately 8o other inmates at the MCC in Rivera's unit that use the same VTC 
room for court appearances, probation interviews, and attorney meetings. By contrast, Maxwell 
shares access to the MDC VTC room with substantially fewer inmates. The MDC can therefore 
provide 15 hours of VTC meetings with her attorneys without compromising access for other 
MDC inmates. The same is not true for Rivera at the MCC. 
Going forward, even though Rivera's counsel have asked (and the Court has ordered) that Rivera 
receive three hours of laptop access each day, the MCC is now leaving the laptop with him all day long, 
and only takes it back at night to charge it. Therefore, the MCC is now providing the same amount of 
electronic discovery access to Rivera that Maxwell receives at the MDC. 
EFTA00023081
--- PAGE 3 ---
As for providing Rivera with up to 15 hours of VTC access, we will explain that doing so will 
compromise access for other inmates. If defense counsel expresses a need for additional time, the 
MCC will continue to find ways to accommodate those requests as best as they can. 
Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss this further. 
Best,

Thanks, 
Can you keep me posted on what we think will be the substance of the draft declaration when you know 
(that is, before we are submitting anything on 12/31)? And how much of this is attributable to differences between MCC 
and MDC, as well as specific differences in their housing situations?

Subject: Disparities in Counsel and Discovery Access for Ghislaine Maxwell and Justin Rivera 
All: 
I wanted to bring to your attention a recent issue that's surfaced in United States v. Rivera et al., a sex 
trafficking case pending before Judge Engelmayer. As I'll describe in more detail below, Judge 
Engelmayer has asked us to submit a declaration from the BOP explaining why the discovery and 
counsel access accommodations provided to Ghislaine Maxwell (detained at the MDC outside the 
general population) cannot be extended to Justin Rivera (detained at the MCC in the general 
population). 
Justin Rivera was charged in February 2019 with sex trafficking conspiracy. He's been detained at the 
MCC since April 2019 on consent (he's also serving a state sentence). His trial, which was originally 
scheduled for April 2019, is expected to start on February 16, 2O2O. In July 2O2O, he had new counsel 
appointed, citing an irreconcilable breakdown with his former counsel. 
Since this fall, Judge Engelmayer has become increasingly frustrated with the MCC's treatment of 
Rivera. In particular, he's cited their failure to provide Rivera with adequate accommodations to 
EFTA00023082
--- PAGE 4 ---
review discovery and meet with his lawyers, who refuse to visit Rivera at the MCC for personal health 
concerns. We have two court orders in place to address these issues: (1) a laptop order, which requires 
the MCC to provide Rivera access to a laptop for three hours per day; and (2) a videoconference order, 
which requires the MCC to make available four hours of videoconferencing each week, in addition to 
any telephone or videoconference calls obtained through the Federal Defenders. 
At the moment, there's not a concern, at least from Judge Engelmayer, that the amount of time Rivera 
has for videoconferences and electronic discovery review is insufficient for trial preparation, although 
defense counsel has stated that they may request more time in the future. However, in a letter last 
night and during a court conference this morning (transcript attached), defense counsel cited the 
accommodations that the MDC has provided to Maxwell, describing them as "strikingly different and 
far superior" to those afforded to Rivera. Defense counsel further suggested that Rivera was being 
treated differently on account of his race, gender and class. Judge Engelmayer stated that the 
disparity in access "jumped off the page" and that the optics were "terrible," and asked us toe lain 
the rationale for the differing treatment. After conferring with 
and 
before 
our conference, we explained our understanding that the disparity comes down to the fact that 
Maxwell and Rivera have very different housing situations, with Maxwell's situation being more 
amenable to greater access to electronic discovery review and legal visits. 
Judge Engelmayer asked us to submit a declaration, from an appropriate person at the BOP, 
explaining in more detail why the accommodations provided to Maxwell cannot be extended to Rivera. 
Based on the recent bail opposition in the Maxwell case, I believe the differences in counsel/discovery 
access are as follows: 
Accommodation 
Maxwell 
Rivera 
Review of electronic 
discovery (NB: each 
defendant has laptop access)
hours per day/7 days per 
week (91 hours total) 
hours per day/7 days per 
week (21 hours total) 
Counsel visits (by video) 
hours per day/5 days per 
week (15 hours total) 
Four hours per week (plus an 
additional two hours 
scheduled through the 
Federal Defenders) (6 hours 
total) 
Weekend legal calls 
As needed 
Not available 
The declaration is due by December 31. Because Judge Engelmayer's request implicates at least two 
criminal cases, and potentially the ongoing civil litigation with the MCC, we wanted to make sure that 
you were all aware of this issue. We are also ha 
to set up a call to discuss this further. In the 
meantime, we are working with 
to identify the appropriate declarant and draft an 
explanation for the Court.

Dear 
I hope you are both doing well, and have been enjoying the end of year festivities. 
I am referring for your attention an MLAT request from the French in relation to their investigation of

about the Maxwell bail proceedings, I took the opportunity to mention that this might be

Re: 
Request for Legal Assistance from France in the Investigation of 
OIA Reference Number: CRM-182-74832: French MOJ/BEPI 
Number: 2020002015 
Dear AUSA=. 
Please find enclosed a request from France for legal assistance in a foreign criminal 
matter. The United States is obligated to assist in such matters pursuant to the 1998 U.S.-France 
Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty, as supplemented by the 2004 U.S.-France Mutual Legal 
Assistance Instrument. Consistent with the requirements of 18 U.S.C. § 3512, the United States 
Attorney's Office (USAO) is authorized to seek any requisite court orders and to take other steps 
necessary to execute the above-referenced request. This matter has been referred to the USAO 
for execution because your office is pursuing a related investigation. Please note that this matter 
should be kept confidential, and all filings with the court should be under seal. 
The Facts 
The facts of the case are set forth in detail in the enclosed request. In sum, French 
authorities have begun an investigation into the actions of Jeffrey EPSTEIN and his accomplices, 
notably 
. The French investigation has focused on 
, and French 
authorities executed as search warrant at EPSTEIN's Paris residence in September 2019, where 
they obtain evidence and information relating to 
and Ghislaine MAXWELL. French 
authorities have identified multiple victims, though a number of charges related to these victims 
are barred by France's statute of limitations. 
EFTA00023110
--- PAGE 2 ---
In furtherance of its investigation, and as outlined in the request, French authorities seek a 
wide variety of information from the United States that may be useful to their investigation. 
Request for Assistance 
To further the investigation, and as outlined in the request, French authorities have 
requested information in possession of . . authorities of use to their information related to 
designated individuals, including 
MAXWELL, and other specified victims. 
Execution of Request 
Based on the information provided by French authorities, the AUSA to whom this request 
is assigned is not expected to need to compel any entities to produce records. Nevertheless, if 
such a step is required, the AUSA should file an application in the U.S. District Court seeking an 
order, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3512, appointing him/her to serve as a commissioner. If the court 
grants the application, the AUSA should serve a "commissioner subpoena(s)" compelling the 
entity to produce the records. A sample pleading is available upon request. 
Coordination with OR 
Please provide me with the name and telephone number of the AUSA to whom this 
request is assigned and ask him or her to analyze the request and notify me immediately if it 
contains insufficient information to permit execution or there are special considerations that will 
result in limited or delayed execution of the request or possible denial of the request. For 
example, if execution would result in harm to a U.S. investigation or prosecution or compromise 
a confidential source, assistance can be delayed or denied or conditions on use can be imposed. 
If such considerations arise with respect to this request, please contact me as soon as possible to 
discuss available options. 
Please keep me apprised of the progress made in executing this request. I will serve as 
the main point of contact for both your office and France. I can be reached by e-mail at 
or by telephone a 
f you have any 
questions regarding the execution of the request or need further information from French 
authorities. You may also contact th

Good morning, 
I am responding to select portions of yesterday's email: 
Ms. Maxwell reports that she is searched, patted, and wanded multiple times per day 
1- Isolation Cell to Day Room 
(USANYS)

EFTA00023113
--- PAGE 2 ---
2- Day Room to VTC Room -
- VTC Room to Day Room 
4- Day Room to Isolation Cell 
additional searches if she goes to and from recreation. 
In addition,mulitple times per day, she is required -to remove her shoes for inspection of her feet and shoes -to 
remove her mask for inspection of her mouth (now with a 
flashlight) 
accompanied by inspection inside and behind her ears. 
Her cell is search multiple times per day: 
In her presence- when she is taken out of her Isolation Cell in the morning Outside her presence-evidenced by 
items removed from her locker and papers left in disarray. 
Also, her personal papers are searched in the Day Room. 
At least 2 guards have eyes on her while she showers (her feet and head 
exposed) -"for her safety." 
Re: ambient temperature, which registered 68.6 on 12/21 (and decreases during the night)- Monday night (12/28) 
the ambient temperature was taken just inside the door frame of her Isolation Cell, not near the external non-
insulated concrete wall on which condensation accumulates due to differentials between external and internal 
temperature. 
Ms. Maxwell was given the third blanket in response to her being cold after condensation had accumulated. 
Unlike other inmates - whose body temperatures elevate heat in common areas - Ms. Maxwell is an isolated 
inmate; no heat is generated from others to provide additional heat. 
Given that she is surveilled 24 hours a day by handheld and stationery cameras, is escorted from locked area to 
locked area in the custody and control of 3 to 6 guards, and has no contact with any other inmates, it is 
unreasonable to compare her circumstances to any other inmate. 
The searching is disproportionate to the amount of security and cameras focused directly on her and her 
circumstances as an isolated inmate under constant surveillance. 
Thank you for your continued assistance. 
Best wishes to you and your family for a happy and healthy new year.

attorneys have reached out to us to inquire about our office assisting her in obtaining a T-Visa. She is 
currently legally in the U.S. on a work visa, but that expires when her passport expires in August of 2020. We've never 
dealt with T-Visas before, so would appreciate any guidance you might be able to provide. Would 
qualify for a T-

Also happy to have a call if that's easier, or if there's someone else we should reach out to, please let me know.

Hi, 
I submitted the request via the on line website of the BOP as suggested by the person I spoke to there. 
The below is what I am requesting at this time. 
i am the sole heir and next of kin of JEFFRFEY EPSTEIN, who died while in federal custody at the MCC in NYC. 
I am requesting the same information that was released to the New York Times regarding all of the information they 
requested under the FOIA regarding my brother's case. 
I would also like a copy of the video tape from the camera outside of the SHU on August 9th 2019, which would show the 
last time anybody (guards, etc) left the SHU prior to my brother being found dead in his cell the next morning. 
This is the tape that then Attorney General Barr publicly stated that he personally watched. 
I would also like a list of the inmates that were on that tier on August 9th, 2019. Also, please provide the information of 
when they were placed on that tier and when and where they were transferred to if they are not still on that tier. 
I would like any information that would reveal the identities of the people in the prison who were directing the action on 
that tier, and who was in the cell with the EMT's that came after my brother was found dead. I am trying to find out why 
normal protocol was not followed in that the body of a clearly dead person was moved prior to the medical examiner 
office being given the chance to photograph the crime scene. I would imagine that there was some sort of incident report 
filed regarding this matter and I would like that as well. 
I would appreciate it if you can get this done in a timely manner. 
Thanks,

Hi Mr. 
As I discussed with Ms.-over 
the summer, you would need to submit a FOIA request to the BOP and note that 
you are specifically requesting what they released to the NYT. You can send me copy of that request once it has been 
submitted to the BOP and as a courtesy I will ensure that the correct recipient in the Civil Division of our Office has 
received it. We do not handle FOIA requests in our division.

Case 1:20-cv-02365-LJL Document 1 Filed 03/17/20 Page 1 of 8 
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
X 
JANE DOE, 
Plaintiff, 
-against-
COMPLAINT 
DARREN K. INDYKE and RICHARD D. KAHN, in their 
capacities as executors of the ESTATE OF JEFFREY E. 
EPSTEIN; 
Defendants. 
X 
Plaintiff, Jane Doe, by her attorneys, Kaiser Saurbom & Mair, P.C., as and for her 
complaint against the defendants, alleges as follows: 
I. 
BACKGROUND 
I. 
Jane Doe seeks justice for the sexual crimes perpetrated against her by Jeffrey 
Epstein over the course of many years and for the abuse, manipulation and exploitation she 
suffered at his hands. Epstein identified Jane Doe as an extremely emotionally vulnerable young 
woman who, at the time she met him, had been entirely abandoned by her community, friends, 
and family which enabled him to seduce her into his world of horrific abuse. Every aspect of her 
life was controlled by Epstein. He dominated her psychologically. Jane Doe was constantly 
emotionally bullied and coerced by Epstein, including being required to submit to his constant 
sexual abuse. This lawsuit is about Jane Doe claiming her power, becoming a survivor, not a 
victim, and getting restitution for the sexual crimes perpetuated against her. She has real 
damages that are lasting: 1) She has permanent emotional injuries; 2) Her capacity to pursue a 
professional career has been severely compromised; 3) Her name and reputation has been ruined; 
EFTA00023140
--- PAGE 2 ---
Case 1:20-cv-02365-LJL Document 1 Filed 03/17/20 Page 2 of 8 
and 4) she is virtually bankrupt, having been forced to spend most of her resources defending 
herself against false accusations, all of which stem from Epstein's crimes. 
2. 
The Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, who perpetrated crimes of sexual abuse, sexual 
assault and rape against Jane Doe, must be held responsible for ruining her life. It has been 
nearly 19 years since Jane Doe was recruited by Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell and 
plunged into a world in which she was psychologically, physically and sexually exploited and 
controlled for years. 
3. 
Jane Doe was a naïve and uniquely vulnerable 22-year old when Epstein and 
Maxwell first preyed upon her. 
II. 
JURISDICTION 
4. 
This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 because 
the claims asserted herein arise under 18 U.S.C. § 1591-1595. 
5. 
Venue is properly laid in this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391 because it is a 
District in which much of the alleged wrongdoing occurred. 
III. 
THE PARTIES 
6. 
Plaintiff is a sex trafficking victim of Epstein. 
7. 
At all times relevant herein, Jeffrey Edward Epstein ("Jeffrey Epstein" or 
"Epstein") maintained a residence and businesses at 9 East 71st Street, New York, NY 10021 
("Epstein's NY Residence") which was the location where Epstein committed repeated sexual 
assaults of young women, like Plaintiff, and engaged in sex trafficking. 
8. 
At all times relevant herein, Epstein was an adult male over the age of 48, born on 
EFTA00023141
--- PAGE 3 ---
Case 1:20-cv-02365-LJL Document 1 Filed 03/17/20 Page 3 of 8 
January 20, 1953, and who died on August 10, 2019. He continued to maintain a residence and 
businesses at 9 East 71st Street, New York, NY 10021, and occupy it until his death. 
9. 
At all times relevant herein, Defendant, Darren K. Indyke, is named in his 
personal capacity as an appointed executor of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein (the "Estate of 
Jeffrey E. Epstein"), which was opened and domiciled in the United States Virgin Islands, St. 
Thomas Division, and is the legal entity responsible for intentional, criminal, and tortious 
conduct committed by Jeffrey Epstein as described in this Complaint. The Estate of Jeffrey E. 
Epstein includes Epstein's NY Residence, which was occupied by Jeffrey Epstein and his 
businesses until his death and was one of the locations where repeated acts of sexual abuse and 
sex trafficking against various women, including plaintiff, occurred. 
10. 
At all times relevant herein, Defendant, Richard D. Kahn, is named in his 
personal capacity as an appointed executor of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein (the "Estate of 
Jeffrey E. Epstein"). 
II. 
At all times relevant herein, Defendant, Darren K. Indyke, is named in his 
personal capacity as an appointed executor of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein (the "Estate of 
Jeffrey E. Epstein"). 
12. 
At all times relevant herein, Jeffrey Epstein (legally represented now through 
Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn as Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein (and 
referred to herein as the "Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein"), owed a duty to Plaintiff to treat her in a 
non-negligent manner and not to commit, or conspire to commit, or cause to be committed, 
intentional, criminal, fraudulent, or tortious acts against Plaintiff, including any acts that would 
cause Plaintiff to be harmed through conduct committed against her in violation of the TVPRA. 
EFTA00023142

Case 1:20-cv-02365-LJL Document 1 Filed 03/17/20 Page 4 of 8 
IV. 
EPSTEIN'S SEX TRAFFICKING CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE 
13. 
At all times relevant herein, Jeffrey Epstein ["Epstein"] was an extremely wealthy 
financier, who used his wealth, power, resources, and connections to commit illegal sexual 
crimes in violation of the TVPRA, and to employ and conspire with other corporate entities, 
private foundations and trusts, to assist him in committing those sexual crimes or torts or to 
facilitate or enable those acts to occur. 
14. 
Epstein displayed his enormous wealth, power, and influence to his employees; to 
the employees of the corporate entities, private foundations, and trusts, who worked at his 
direction; to the victims procured for sexual purposes; and to the public, in order to advance and 
carry out and conceal his crimes and torts. 
15. 
At all times relevant herein, Epstein had access to numerous mansions, a fleet of 
airplanes, motor vehicles, boats and several helicopters. 
16. 
At all times relevant herein, Jeffrey Epstein travelled between and frequently 
inhabited and travelled between numerous properties and homes, including a Manhattan 
townhome located at 9 East 71st Street, New York, NY 10021 valued conservatively by Jeffrey 
Epstein's own admission at $55,931,000.00; a ranch located at 49 Zorro Ranch Road, Stanley, 
New Mexico 87056 valued conservatively by Jeffrey Epstein's own admission at 
$17,246,208.00; a home located at 358 El Brillo Way, Palm Beach, Florida 33480 valued 
conservatively by Jeffrey Epstein's own admission at $12,380,209.00; an apartment located at 22 
Avenue Foch, Paris, France 75116 valued conservatively by Jeffrey Epstein's own admission at 
$8,672,820.00; and an Island Little St. James Island No. 6B USVI 00802 (A, B, C). 
17. 
As has been publicly reported, Epstein had a compulsive sexual preference for 
EFTA00023143
--- PAGE 5 ---
Case 1:20-cv-02365-LJL Document 1 Filed 03/17/20 Page 5 of 8 
young females and took pleasure in corrupting vulnerable young females into engaging in sexual 
acts with him. The allegations herein primarily concern Jeffrey Epstein's conduct while at his 
NY, Virgin Islands, Florida, New Mexico, and Paris residences and other locations. 
18. 
Epstein fulfilled his compulsive need for sexual contact with and control over 
young females by preying on their personal, psychological, financial, and related vulnerabilities. 
Epstein's tactics included promising the victims shelter, transportation, gifts, money and 
employment, admission into educational institutions, educational tuition, protection, illusion of 
family and other things of value in exchange for sex. 
19. 
Jeffrey Epstein specifically targeted underprivileged, emotionally vulnerable 
and/or economically disadvantaged young females exactly like Plaintiff to sexually molest and 
abuse. 
20. 
Epstein's continuous psychological and physical control over Jane Doe facilitated 
his sexual abuse of her on a relatively consistent basis for many years. 
21. 
The sexual abuse took many forms including Epstein's rape of Plaintiff. 
22. 
He would also enter plaintiff's room and get into her bed while she was sleeping 
and then fondle or penetrate her with his fingers. This occurred often and repeatedly. 
23. 
He often directed her to undress and pose in certain ways and/or touch him and 
herself while he masturbated. This occurred often and repeatedly. 
24. 
Epstein frequently directed Jane Doe to turn her head back during their sexual 
encounters, telling her that he did not want to see her face. 
25. 
Epstein also repeatedly required Jane Doe to bathe with him and perform oral sex 
on him. 
26. 
This occurred in New York, Palm Beach, New Mexico, London, Paris, on 
EFTA00023144
--- PAGE 6 ---
Case 1:20-cv-02365-LJL Document 1 Filed 03/17/20 Page 6 of 8 
Epstein's private island, on Epstein's airplanes and other locations. 
27. 
Jane Doe was paid in part to be sexually available to Epstein. 
28. 
In or about January or February 2012, Epstein grabbed Plaintiff by the hand while 
at his New York City Residence and took her to a small room on the third floor. It was a room 
with two chairs in it. He sat her down, pulled her pants down, covered her eyes, and used a 
vibrator on her. Epstein laughed afterwards. 
CAUSE OF ACTION I AGAINST EPSTEIN 
29. 
Defendant, within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United 
States, in interstate and foreign commerce, and/or affecting interstate and foreign commerce, 
knowingly recruited, enticed, harbored, transported, provided, obtained, maintained, patronized, 
solicited, threatened, forced, or coerced Plaintiff to engage in commercial sex acts. 
30. 
Such actions were undertaken knowing that Defendant Epstein's use of force, 
threats of force, fraud, coercion, and/or combinations of such means would be used, and were in 
fact used, in order to cause Plaintiff to engage in commercial sex acts. In doing so, Defendant 
violated 18 U.S.C. § 1591. 
31. 
Furthermore, Defendant attempted to violate 18 U.S.C. § 1591. In doing so, 
violated U.S.C. § 1594(a). 
32. 
Defendant conspired with each member of the enterprise, and with other persons 
known and unknown, to violate 18 U.S.C. § 1591. In so doing, Defendant violated U.S.C. § 
1594(a). 
33. 
By virtue of Defendant's violations of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591, I593A, and 1594, 
Defendant Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Khan as Joint Personal Representatives of the Estate 
of Jeffrey E. Epstein is subject to civil causes of action under 18 U.S.C. § 1595 by Plaintiff, who 
EFTA00023145
--- PAGE 7 ---
Case 1:20-cv-02365-LJL Document 1 Filed 03/17/20 Page 7 of 8 
is a victim of the violations. 
34. 
Certain property of Defendant was essential to the commission of the federal 
crimes and torts described herein, including the use of multiple private aircraft including a 
Boeing aircraft (of make and model B-727-31H with a tail number N908JE) and a Gulfstream 
aircraft (of make and model G-1159B with a tail number N909JE). Such aircraft, along with 
other of Defendants' property, were used as means and instruments of Defendants' tortious and 
criminal offenses and, as such, are subject to forfeiture. 
35. 
Additionally, Defendant's mansion, located at 9 East 71" Street, New York, New 
York, in the Southern District of New York, his Palm Beach residence and his private island 
located in the United States Virgin Islands, and his ranch in New Mexico were among those used 
as means and instruments of Defendants' tortious and criminal offenses, and, as such, are subject 
to forfeiture. 
36. 
As direct and proximate result of Defendant's commission of the aforementioned 
criminal offenses enumerated in 18 U.S.C. § 1591, 1593A, and 1594, and the associated civil 
remedies provide in § 1595, Plaintiff has in the past suffered and will continue to suffer injury 
and pain; emotional distress; psychological and psychiatric trauma; mental anguish; humiliation; 
confusion; embarrassment; loss of self-esteem; loss of dignity; loss of enjoyment of life; invasion 
of privacy; and other damages associated with actions. Plaintiff will incur further legal, medical 
and psychological expenses. These injuries are permanent in nature and Plaintiff will continue to 
suffer from them in the future. In addition to these losses, Plaintiff has incurred attorneys' fees 
and will be required do so in the future. 
37. 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff demands judgment against Defendants for compensatory 
and general damages, attorneys' fees, punitive damages and such other and further relief as this 
EFTA00023146
--- PAGE 8 ---
Case 1:20-cv-02365-LJL Document 1 Filed 03/17/20 Page 8 of 8 
Court deems just proper. Plaintiff hereby demands trial by jury on all issues triable as of right by 
a jury. 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff demands judgment against defendants as follows: 
(i) 
Assessing compensatory damages and punitive damages in an amount to be 
determined at trial; 
(ii) 
Attorney's fees and interest, and disbursements; and 
(iii) 
For such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

I unfortunately was on trial during the previous interview, but I think somewhat less time than how long it went last time. 
Ordinarily we try not to go longer than about 90 minutes in any event, so I think if she is able to block out that amount of 
time, that would be great — and we'll try to be as efficient as possible and hopefully take less than that. If that sounds 
alright?

Hi Sigrid, 
We wanted to follow up in connection with 
— our supervisors have asked us to do an additional interview with her, 
both to follow up on some specific aspects of her recollection but also do basically go through her experiences again. As 
I'm sure you know, we have no doubts whatsoever, at all, about her candor and truthfulness in our previous interview, 
which also was broadly consistent with what she has said in other interviews, but we are nevertheless hoping she might 
be willing to speak with us sometime in the next week or two? Obviously due to the current situation we would plan to 
do it via phone, and we would be happy to chat about logistics with you if that would be helpful, or to answer any 
questions at all. And if 
is willing to speak with us again, we're happy to work around her schedule, including talking 
during an evening or weekend if that's easier for her than during the day—whatever you and she would prefer. 
Please let us know if any questions, or if it would be useful to chat, and thanks very much.

Hello — attached are the pages

asked her to take a copy of the front and back of the journal book which she did. Hope this helps. Please let 
me know if you need anything else: 
"The shortest page and the one that is the hardest to read is the first entry from 12/95. It is written in colored 
pencil and is fading. There are then two pages from 01/07/1996 where I talk about the highlights of my NY 
trip and going to Epstein's house and then the next entry from 01/25/1996 is where I talk about going to the 
movies with him."

Hi Sigrid, 
Subject: 
follow-up request 
Hope you had a wonderful holida season and very happy New Year. We wanted to follow up on a request we 
made after interviewing 
a few months ago. During her interview, 
referred to several 
entries in her journal that had helped refresh her recollection of the events involving Epstein and Maxwell. As 
we mentioned at the end of the interview, it would be very helpful to our investigation if we could review 
those journal entries, as well as any other records or documents 
may have that relate to her experiences 
with Epstein and Maxwell. 
Would 
be willing to share with us any relevant journal entries (or any other relevant documents she may 
have) to assist in our investigation? 
Happy to have a call to discuss if that would be helpful. 
Thank you,

We wanted to follow up in connection with 
— our supervisors have asked us to do an additional interview with her, 
both to follow up on some specific aspects of her recollection but also do basically go through her experiences again. As 
I'm sure you know, we have no doubts whatsoever, at all, about her candor and truthfulness in our previous interview, 
which also was broadly consistent with what she has said in other interviews, but we are nevertheless hoping she might 
be willing to speak with us sometime in the next week or two? Obviously due to the current situation we would plan to 
do it via phone, and we would be happy to chat about logistics with you if that would be helpful, or to answer any 
questions at all. And if 
is willing to speak with us again, we're happy to work around her schedule, including talking 
during an evening or weekend if that's easier for her than during the day—whatever you and she would prefer. 
Please let us know if any questions, or if it would be useful to chat, and thanks very much.

Hello — attached are the pages 
sent me to provide to you. Here is a bit of an explanation and I also 
asked her to take a copy of the front and back of the journal book which she did. Hope this helps. Please let 
me know if you need anything else: 
"The shortest page and the one that is the hardest to read is the first entry from 12/95. It is written in colored 
pencil and is fading. There are then two pages from 01/07/1996 where I talk about the highlights of my NY 
trip and going to Epstein's house and then the next entry from 01/25/1996 is where I talk about going to the 
movies with him."

Let me follow up with 
about her journal. I know she shared some pictures with you from around the 
time period when she was with Epstein/Maxwell. I will ask her about the journal ASAP and will get back to

Hope you had a wonderful holida season and very happy New Year. We wanted to follow up on a request we 
made after interviewing 
a few months ago. During her interview, 
referred to several 
entries in her journal that had helped refresh her recollection of the events involving Epstein and Maxwell. As 
we mentioned at the end of the interview, it would be very helpful to our investigation if we could review 
those journal entries, as well as any other records or documents 
may have that relate to her experiences 
with Epstein and Maxwell. 
Would 
be willing to share with us any relevant journal entries (or any other relevant documents she may 
have) to assist in our investigation? 
Happy to have a call to discuss if that would be helpful. 
Thank

Tomorrow morning would actually be fine — we'll send you a calendar invite for 11:00 a.m. Eastern time, including a 
conference line number, and we'll plan to talk with you then. And just as a heads up, not that I particularly expect this will 
be necessary, but similar to how we always tell witnesses that if they want to talk with their counsel privately during an in-
person meeting, we'll let her know that the same thing holds true for over the phone as well, that you two can always 
have a side call at any point! And otherwise I think it will be the usual awkwardness of phone but hopefully not too bad.

I unfortunately was on trial during the previous interview, but I think somewhat less time than how long it went last time. 
Ordinarily we try not to go longer than about 90 minutes in any event, so I think if she is able to block out that amount of

The Maxwell team would like to send a "friendly subpoena" to real estate attorne), 
who handled the 
purchase of Maxwell's New Hampshire property in 2019. 
reached out to the FBI following Maxwell's arrest and 
offered her assistance. She requested via email the forma ity o a subpoena before providing us non-privileged 
documents from her file. As such, we do not need PSEU's approval, but we do need 
approval to issue the 
subpoena. The proposed subpoena is attached to this email. In short, we are seeking any non-privileged documents and 
records regarding the purchase of Maxwell's New Hampshire property. These records are relevant to our ongoing 
investigation into Maxwell's finances, including any financial ties to Epstein and any efforts Epstein may have made to buy 
Maxwell's silence. 
Please let us know if you have any questions or would like to discuss.

Subject: RE: Subpoena to Interlochen Center for the Arts 
Jeff and George, 
Thank you both very much for your assistance in response to our subpoenas seeking records from Interlochen. In 
reviewing the documents you produced in response to the attached subpoena, a follow-up question arose. Would 
you please confirm that your production included all records of any tuition payments that Epstein (or his entities) 
made for any students at Interlochen? 
Our team is also happy to discuss this inquiry over the phone if that would be useful. I am starting a trial tomorrow 
and will have limited availability this week, but my colleagues 
and 
(both cc'd) should be 
able to coordinate with you as needed.

United States v. Maxwell, 20cr330 
Preliminary Remarks Prior to Questionnaire 
To be video recorded and played on 11/4, 11/5, and 11/12 
Hello everyone. Thank you so much for being here. And welcome to the Southern 
District of New York. My name is Judge Alison Nathan and I am the judge who will preside 
over the trial for which you have been summoned. I have recorded this message to you because 
you are spread out in different rooms and over different times as part of the District's COVID 
safety protocols. I look forward to seeing you in person as this process moves forward. 
We are about to start the process of selecting a jury to try a criminal case. I'm going to 
briefly describe the process to you as it may be different than what some of you have previously 
experienced when summoned for jury duty. 
The first part of the process is going to occur now. In a few minutes, after you've been 
sworn to tell the truth, you will fill out a questionnaire. The purpose of the questionnaire is for 
you to provide information to myself, to the prosecutors, to defense counsel, and to the defendant 
to assist all of us in determining whether you can be a fair and impartial juror in this case. 
When you are done filling out the questionnaire, you will return it to the Jury Department 
staff and you will be done for the day. Some of you will be asked to return for a phase two, 
which will involve in-person questioning by me. That is going to start on November 16. So you 
are free of jury service with respect to this case from whenever you finish the questionnaire until 
at least November 16. Some of those who are going to return will come in on November 16, 
some will come on November I7'h, and possibly there will be one or two more days. You will 
get instructions before you leave here today about how you will find out whether you are going 
EFTA00023196
--- PAGE 3 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 366 Filed 10/22/21 Page 3 of 6 
to have to come back at all for the in-person questioning in this case and exactly what date and 
time you would be obliged to be here. 
Once that in-person questioning is completed, some of that group will be asked to return 
for the last step in the jury selection, and some of that last group will be selected to serve on the 
jury-
The trial in this case will begin on November 29 and we expect it to last approximately 
six weeks. We will of course not sit on federal holidays, including Christmas Eve and Christmas 
and New Year's Eve and New Year's Day. The questionnaire will explain the estimated 
schedule more fully and you will get to that in a moment. 
But first, I want to tell you a little bit about the case. As I mentioned, this is a criminal 
case. The charges against the Defendant are set forth in an indictment. An indictment is a 
formal method of accusing someone of a crime. It is not evidence of any kind. It is the 
Government's burden at trial to establish a defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. 
This case is brought by the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of 
New York against Ghislaine Maxwell. The indictment against Ms. Maxwell alleges that she 
conspired with and aided and abetted Jeffrey Epstein to entice minor females to travel to engage 
in criminal sexual activity, to transport minors to engage in criminal sexual activity, and to 
engage in sex trafficking of a minor. Ms. Maxwell has pled not guilty to all charges. Ms. 
Maxwell is presumed innocent, and before she can be found guilty on any charge, the jury must 
find that the Government has proven each element of that crime beyond a reasonable doubt. 
Now, as some of you may have already figured out, there is going to be significant press 
coverage of this trial. Some of you may have already heard about this case in the media, and that 
is OK. But from this moment on, I instruct you that you are not to read or watch or listen to 
EFTA00023197
--- PAGE 4 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 366 Filed 10/22/21 Page 4 of 6 
anything that has anything at all to do with this case or anyone involved in the case. You are not 
to discuss this case among yourselves, you are not to discuss it with anyone, including your 
family, friends, anyone. You may say that you are part of the jury selection process in a criminal 
case in federal court, but that is all you may say. Moreover, you are not to do any research 
through any means about the case or anyone involved in it. That includes the defendant, it 
includes the judge, it includes the lawyers, and it includes any other names you hear about today. 
And it means, among other things, that you are not to chatter about it on Facebook, Twitter, 
Instagram, Tiktok, Snapchat, or any other social media services. You are not to read anything 
about it online or in the paper. You are not to watch or listen to anything about it on television, 
the radio, or on podcasts. You are not to do a Google search or any other kind of search. You 
may not do any of that and that is very important. As I am sure you understand, we must ensure 
that we have a jury of citizens who will decide the issues in this case based only on the evidence 
that is presented in court during the trial. 
Because this is a high-profile case AND because we are still in the age of COVID, I want 
to assure you that the Court will take a number of steps to protect your privacy and safety. First, 
when you are filling out the questionnaire and as we go through the later stages of the process, I 
ask that you please not identify yourself by your name or identify anyone you are associated with 
by name. Throughout the selection process and if you are selected as a juror, although the 
lawyers and I will know your names, we will only refer to you in Court by your juror number. 
This will protect your privacy. 
Second, due to COVID and to ensure easy access into and out of the Courthouse, the 
Court will arrange and provide transportation for selected jurors to and from the Courthouse 
every day of trial. 
EFTA00023198
--- PAGE 5 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 366 Filed 10/22/21 Page 5 of 6 
And third, for those of you who are selected, we will provide breakfast, lunch, and snacks 
as well as places in the Courthouse where you can eat while maintaining adequate distance from 
each other while doing so. We also have all kinds of measures in place to assure safe distancing 
and air filtration in the Courtroom. And of course, everyone is required to wear masks. 
Ok, I will end here with a few points about how to fill out the questionnaire and then I 
will leave you to it. First, read all of the directions in the questionnaire. Second, please enter 
your juror number on the front page of the questionnaire and at the top of each page. Where 
indicated, please check the space for yes or no or unsure and, as requested, provide answers, 
explanations or details on the lines provided. 
Please answer every question. If you don't understand a question, please write, I don't 
understand. If you don't know the answer to a question, write I don't know. Please do not write 
on the back of any page. There are pages at the end for extra space if you need it. 
Please don't leave the room while you are completing the questionnaire. If you need to 
use the restroom, please hand the questionnaire to one of the members of the Jury Department 
staff, follow their directions, and retrieve it upon your return. 
Please do not discuss the questions or your answers with anyone, including your fellow 
prospective jurors. 
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your service. Jury trials are part of the bedrock of 
American democracy. Citizen jurors, not judges, decide the outcome of criminal and civil 
disputes. This right to trial by jury is enshrined in the Sixth and Seventh Amendments to our 
Constitution. 
Each of you have responded to the call to serve. Doing so will involve some 
inconvenience and hardship. But by your willingness to serve, by your truthful answers to the 
EFTA00023199
--- PAGE 6 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 366 Filed 10/22/21 Page 6 of 6 
questions posed to you, and by your careful following of the rules and instructions I have 
provided, you are doing your part to support the cherished American institution of trial by jury. 
Thank you.

Good evening -
During my in-person visit yesterday with Ms. Maxwell, the HEPA filters were not operating in the visiting room that I have 
been required 
to use, even when more than one attorney is present. The officers told me to use the larger, corner room. 
Previous requests to use this more ample corner mom have been denied because the officers' claim 
the camera cannot be positioned. Yesterday, the officers simply and easily positioned the camera focused on the corner room. 
I am requesting that future in-person visits be conducted in the larger corner room. 
The previous reason for denying that request appears invalid. 
Also, legal mail sent to the MDC has not been picked up by the facility. See tracking information below. 
Please promptly provide an explanation and inform me when Ms. Maxwell will receive these deliveries. 
Thank you-
Bobbi

Dear Mr. Falk:

We represent the defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell, in the above-referenced matter. This 
letter constitutes a request made pursuant to United States a. rel. Touhy v. Regan, 340 U.S. 462 
(1951) and 6 C.F.R. § 5.43(a)(1) for the production of documents in the possession of the U.S. 
Customs and Border Protection at the trial in this case on November 29, 2019 at 9:00 A.M., 
before the Honorable Alison J. Nathan, United States District Judge. The requested documents 
are set forth in the attached subpoena. 
In accordance with 6 C.F.R. § 5.45(a), we make the following statement setting forth "the 
nature and relevance" of the information we seek: 
On March 29, 2021, Ghislaine Maxwell was charged in a superseding indictment 
with the following offenses: (1) Count One: conspiracy to entice minors to travel 
to engage in illegal sex acts, (2) Count Two: enticement of a minor to travel to 
engage in illegal sex acts, (3) Count Three: conspiracy to transport minors with 
intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, (4) Count Four: transportation of a 
minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, (5) Count Five: sex 
trafficking conspiracy, and (6) Count Six: sex trafficking of a minor. The charges 
relate to an alleged scheme between Ms. Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein to sexually 
abuse underaged girls from in or about 1994 to in or about 2004. 
The three individuals listed in the attached subpoena are identified in the 
superseding indictment as "Minor Victim I," "Minor Victim 2," and "Minor 
Victim 3." All three individuals are expected to testify for the government at trial. 
All three of the witnesses traveled internationally during the time period covered 
by the attached subpoena, and some have alleged that they traveled at the request

of, or with the assistance of, Jeffrey Epstein. Because the crimes alleged require 
interstate or foreign travel, the border crossing records for these individuals will 
be directly relevant at trial. 
If you have any questions or would like to discuss further, please do not hesitate to 
contact me.

Re: 
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
Dear Counsel: 
Today the Government is producing additional materials, including Jencks Act and 
Giglio material, regarding witnesses who may be called to testify at trial in the above-referenced 
case. Enclosed please find an index detailing the materials included in today's production. 
The Government is also producing today certain materials relating to individuals the 
Government does not currently intend to call as witnesses at trial in the above-referenced case. 
These materials do not contain a comprehensive set of Jencks Act and Giglio materials, as the 
Government does not expect to call these individuals to testify at trial. Instead, these materials 
contain, among other things, certain witness statements. Enclosed please find an index detailing 
these materials. Please note that the records stamped 3501.507 through 3501.516 were previously 
produced to you on October 11, 2021 with a different stamp (3501.450 through 3501.459), which 
was inadvertently used for two sets of witnesses. The Government is reproducing the materials to 
avoid any confusion. This production should not be taken to indicate that the Government believes 
it has any obligation to provide all of these materials; rather, we make this production as a courtesy. 
Moreover, although the Government presently does not intend to call the individuals listed in the 
EFTA00023217
--- PAGE 2 ---
Page 2 
enclosed index, we reserve the right to do so and will notify you should the Government determine 
that it intends to call any of these individuals at trial. 
Please note that this letter, the enclosed indices, and the enclosed materials are 
governed by the July 31, 2020 Protective Order in this case. In particular, certain materials are 
designated as "confidential" under the Protective Order. The index is itself designated as 
"confidential," because it includes information regarding records designated as 
"confidential" under the Protective Order. The Department of Justice directed this office to 
cease the dissemination of materials marked with the word "confidential" in order to avoid 
potential confusion with markings reserved for classified documents. Accordingly, in order to 
note the appropriate designation of this production under the operative Protective Order in this 
case, the materials being produced today are marked with the following label: "SUBJECT TO 
PROTECTIVE ORDER PARAGRAPHS 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, and 17." This marking directly refers to 
the specific paragraphs of the Protective Order that govern today's production. 
Additionally, please note that many of the individuals referenced in this production are 
represented by counsel, as detailed in the enclosed indices. The Government reserves its right to 
amend and supplement these disclosures. 
Very truly yours, 
DAMIAN WILLIAMS

All: 
We want to give you a draft of our suggested changes (attached) before our conversation this afternoon. We 
realize the time is short before our scheduled call, so if you do not have sufficient time to review it in 
advance of our call, we are happy to push the time for our call back until after you have had a chance to 
review it. 
We have tried to work within the framework you provided. There are some allegations which we do not 
believe are accurate. Given the long passage of time, however, we understand that there might be different 
recollections about what occurred. We have tried to set forth both views of what occurred. We understand 
that you do not want a Fatico hearing and are willing to agree that we will not ask for a Fatico hearing to 
attempt to resolve the different recollections. 
With respect to the specific allegations about 
being present during massages when girls were sexually 
assaulted, 
does not believe she was ever present during any of these incidents and believes that the 
girls misremember the circumstances. We note that these events occurred a long time ago and were 
emotionally charged, a circumstance which can cause people to have faulty memories. 
Indeed, we think that some of the evidence seems to contradict the victim's claims that 
was present 
when they, as minors, were sexually molested by Epstein. 
Specifically, based on allegations in a lawsuit, one of the victims referred to in the statement of facts states 
that she was abused on Epstein's ranch when she was a minor and that 
was present. But flight logs 
reflect that the first time that the victim was on a flight to or from the ranch where she states the abuse 
occurred was in April 2003, after the victim was 18 years old. Moreover, the victim's attorney has also stated 
that a photo of the victim and Epstein in which the victim is smiling, taken in December 2002, was taken 
before the victim knew that Epstein would sexually abuse her. This appears to contradict the victim's 
allegation that in the summer of 2002 she was flown to the ranch and abused by Epstein in the presence of 
To be clear, we are not asserting that this victim is lying about Epstein abusing her. Our point is simply that 
this occurred 18 years ago and that she appears to be confused about the timing of events and who was 
present. 
Another victim claims that that 
walked in on an incident where the victim was performing 
on 
Epstein in his New York townhouse. This victim has named 
as a defendant in her civil suit and has 
alleged that this incident occurred in 2005. During this time period, 
worked out of Maxwell's home 
and spent little time in Epstein's townhouse. Staff, including =, 
were never allowed to roam the halls or 
go into private areas of Epstein's Manhattan home unless they were summoned there. 
never walked in 
on someone when that person was giving Epstein 
and believes that this victim must be confusing 
her with someone else. 
EFTA00023223
--- PAGE 4 ---
does not doubt that Epstein abused these women, as he did with almost all young women and girls 
he came into contact with, but the available evidence does not support the assertion that 
was 
present for or witnessed any sexual abuse of these victims while they were minors. Accordingly, we do not 
object to allowing these women telling their stories but we cannot agree that the allegations in their stories 
concerning 
are correct. 
Let us know what would work best for a call.

Not much to report. 
In Epstein, interviews planned for today in Florida were postponed due to weather. 
In MCC, two inmates across from Epstein's cell were supposed to be interviewed. One declined the interview and the 
other had nothing of interest to contribute. He slept through the night and only saw the activities in the morning after 
Epstein was found in his cell.

Hey Guys — we continue to get requests from the Tartaglione defense team related to the Epstein investigation. In light of 
a recent request, can we please review your notes from inmates in the SHU on the date of the attempted suicide to 
determine if there are any inmates who gave statements that corroborate Tartaglione's account that he saved Epstein's 
life? We think this could arguably be penalty-phase Brady, so we'd like to review this in the first instance, and then discuss 
with you any disclosures we think need to be made.

the Co-Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein (the "Estate") on November 14, 2019 to the 
Superior Court of the United States Virgin Islands (the "USVI Court") for approval. Our 
response does not constitute the Co-Executors' position regarding discovery (e.g., whether 
discovery is appropriate at this time or the information you requested is discoverable in the 
actions pending in the Southern District of New York); rather, we respond in order to further the 
parties' discussions concerning the Program. 
Accordingly, we repeat your inquiries below and address them to the best of our ability 
based on currently available information. 
1. "What is the total value of Epstein's Estate?" 
The total assets held by the Estate are a matter of public record: the Co-Executors' 
Petition for Probate and for Letters Testamentary, filed on August 19, 2019 in the United States 
Virgin Islands, valued the Estate's assets in excess of $577 million. 
However, the Estate is subject to substantial potential liabilities in an undetermined 
amount, which makes it impossible to accurately calculate the total value of the Estate. Among 
other things, (i) the Estate is subject to estate taxes in at least two jurisdictions, the United 
States and France; (ii) the United States Department of Justice has indicated that it may seek 
civil forfeiture of properties held by the Estate; and (iii) your clients and other claimants have 
lodged 17 separate lawsuits in New York state and federal courts, seeking multi-million-dollar 
damages awards. Moreover, the number and size of future claims is unknown: one plaintiffs' 
EFTA00023230

sanders 
counsel recently predicted that "[p]otentially dozens" more additional lawsuits will be filed, 
without specifying exact numbers of such cases or the damages that may be sought.' 
For these reasons, it is simply not possible at present for the Co-Executors to state the 
total value of the Estate. However, if you and other plaintiffs' counsel provide us with a 
complete report on how many additional claims your clients intend to assert — as well as a 
realistic assessment of damages to be sought in those claims — the Co-Executors can gain a 
better understanding of the Estate's potential liabilities. 
2. "How much of Epstein's Estate will be set aside for compensating victims 
through the proposed claims resolution program?" 
The Co-Executors await approval of the Program by the USVI Court. In the interim, 
Program Administrator Jordana Feldman and Program Designers Kenneth Feinberg and 
Camille Biros are proceeding with preparation of a detailed Program protocol to establish a fair, 
independent claims resolution process as a voluntary alternative to protracted civil litigation. As 
we understand it, the Program Administrator intends to reach out to your firm and other 
plaintiffs' counsel for input on the content of that protocol. 
Once the Program protocol is finalized, the Co-Executors will submit it to the USVI Court 
for approval and seek an order to formally commence claims resolution proceedings under the 
Program. It remains to be seen how many claimants — your clients included — will decide to 
participate in the Program. When the number of participating claimants become clearer, the Co-
Executors anticipate being better able to estimate how much money will ultimately be required 
to adequately fund the Program. It is the Co-Executors' intent that the Program be "open-
ended" regarding amounts awarded — i.e., the Estate will not impose any absolute numerical 
cap on the Program's aggregate compensation payments. 
• 
• 
For any other questions you or your clients may have about the proposed Program, we 
urge you to contact Ms. Feldman and her team as soon as possible. It is also in all parties' 
interests for you to begin a constructive dialogue with Ms. Feldman and her team. We 
appreciate any assistance your firm and other plaintiffs' counsel can provide in enabling the 
Program to serve its desired function as a preferred, confidential, non-adversarial alternative to 
litigation, both for your clients and any other individuals seeking to resolve sexual abuse claims 
against Mr. Epstein or the Estate. 
See November 21, 2019 transcript of proceedings held in Doe v. Epstein. et at. 19-CV-07675 (GBD) 
(S.D.N.Y.) and VE v. Nine East 71st Street et at, 19-CV-07625 (AJN) (S.D.N.Y.), at 38:7-14.

To clarify, the cancelled trip was a long-scheduled personal trip. Because of the work travel scheduled for this week, I had 
to cancel my outbound personal travel flight, and I was charged $100 for that cancellation (which I paid for personally). 
I'm just wondering if that's reimbursable because I wouldn't have been charged that fee if it wasn't for the work trip I now 
am going on this week. 
thanks,

Just a quick question regarding the cancelled trip for this Thursday (5/30/19). Was this trip booked through CWT by phone 
or online? If either scenario, I'll need the cancelled record locator to see if it's refundable, and ask them to send me a 
document stating it was refunded to your government travel card. Thanks.

Hi 
I have a trip scheduled for this week that just got final approval late Friday night, so I made reservations on E2 this 
weekend and wanted to let you know in case you need to do things for authorization and/or if you want to consolidate 
the reservations (unfortunately I couldn't figure out how to do everything together so ended up with three different 
reservations—I'm sorry about that!). 
Because I had a previously-scheduled trip to San Francisco on this Thursday, • approved my second leg flight to go 
straight there (rather than coming back to NYC). The reservations I made are: 
Tuesday, May 28, flight from LGA to PBI 
- 
JetBlue, departing 1:27 p.m. (arriving 4:25 p.m.) 
Tuesday, May 28, hotel in West Palm Beach 
- 
Hilton West Palm Beach, from May 28 to May 30 
Thursday, May 30, flight from PBI to SFO (with layover in ATL) 
- 
Delta, departing 5:30 a.m. (arriving ATL at 7:12 a.m., departing ATL at 8:10 a.m.) arriving SFO at 10:22 a.m. 
If these need to be canceled and re-booked as one itinerary, that's totally fine, I just didn't want to wait until the day 
before to at least make the reservations. 
Last question is, I had to cancel my New York to San Francisco flight previously scheduled for Thursday morning (because 
there were no flights late enough to be after our final interviews in Florida on Wednesday, or early enough to get me back 
to New York on Thursday) which incurred a $100 cancellation fee. Is it possible to be reimbursed for that? 
Please let me know if any questions at all, apologies again for any inconvenience, and thanks as always.

book the second leg of the work trip straight to San Francisco, rather than back to New York? I'd have to take a 5:30 
a.m. flight but that way we could do the interviews with all the victims we'd like to meet with. Sorry for any 
inconvenience but wanted to check —thank you!

three days next week for meetings and interviews in West Palm Beach, Florida. As of now we tentatively expect to fly

Unfortunately we're still trying to pin down timing for interviewing the victims, so depending on the timing it will 
either be me and

but we wanted to ask for permission now either way so we weren't 
doing it super last minute after the holiday on Tuesday. And also same as last time, we'd like to ask permission to 
reserve a conference room at the hotel for the interviews, please.

Subject: Epstein financials 
ICYM missed our story from last week I am sending it to you as we will continue report out the mystery of 
Epstein's financial operation on the Virgin Islands which benefited from a incredibly lucrative tax break afforded 
by US and Virgin Islands law. 
The biggest question remains the $200 million that Epstein's Southern Trust took in as revenue and made in 
profits -- in the years after his Florida conviction. We remain committed to getting to the bottom of this puzzling 
influx of cash. Is there any guidance the office can provide that there is interest in the financial issues raised by 
the Epstein affair, even after his death. 
Finally we have been told that the offices of Southern Trust were searched on Aug. 12-- the same day authorities 
search Epstein's island residence. Can you confirm? 
We also have been told by an eyewitness that two weeks before Epstein's arrest, there were several large garbage 
bags with shredded documents seen outside the office door to Southern Trust. Do you know anything about this? 
If nothing else, I hope we can engage some discussion on these issues. As much as we are committed to solving 
the many mysteries of Epstein's financial business, we want to separate fact from fiction and fact from Internet 
conspiracies

Thanks very much, Glen. Let's plan for 1pm on Thursday, 11 12.1 will circulate a WebEx invitation shortly. 
We expect to ask Mr
about his interactions with 
employee who worked in Saint Thomas and who had Mr. 
listed as a contact in his phone. I expect we will ask for 
an approximate timeline of when Mr. 
met and interacted with
, the nature of those interactions, and any 
interaction 
may have had with Epstein (to the best of Mr
knowledge). 
Best.

Sorry for the delay. Looks like we can do between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. on Tuesday, 11/10, or anytime on Thursday, 11/12. 
Let us know if anything in that range will work. 
So as to make sure Mr.le 
prepared, can you give us an overview of what you expect to cover?

As I believe we mentioned when we last spoke, we would like to schedule time for a second interview with Mr. 
via 
WebEx. Are there any days the week of November 9th when your team and Mr. 
would be available? We would 
expect this proffer to be much shorter than our first, and certainly no more than two hours at most.

I was in the midst of making your travel reservations, but I'm unable to see the return flight from PNS — LGA 
departing at 6:44pm on 2/19, arriving at 12:03am on 2/20 that you requested in the attached email below. I assume that it's 
no longer available. 
The latest flight returning to LGA is leaving at 4:06pm, which I assume is too early. The latest return flight time I found that's 
fully refundable is departing PNS at 5:53pm, arriving in JFK at 1:24am on 2/20/20. Let me know if this flight is okay to book 
and I'll reserve it ASAP. Thanks.

Would you please help us book travel to Pensacola, FL and back for next week? I'd like refundable tickets for the following 
flights, please: 
• 
Tuesday 2/18 American Airlines flight from LGA to PNS, departing 5:00 PM, arriving 9:03 PM (layover in DCA) 
• 
Wednesday 2/19 American Airlines flight from PNS to LGA, departing 6:44 PM, arriving 12:03 AM (layover in CLT) 
Please make sure the tickets are refundable just in case we need to move things around. We are still waiting to hear back 
from the agents about where exactly we should be staying for the hotel, so we'd like to just book the flights for now, and I'll 
let you know when we have a more precise location for the hotel. 
Thanks very much,

the Delta departing flight you chose leaving LGA at 9:00am, arriving in Pensacola, FL at 12:49pm is not refundable, so 
you'll need to choose another flight option. While checking out your flight options, I found a flight that will get you into 
Pensacola, FL around the same time as your preferred option that's fully refundable. The difference is that the flight 
leaves at 8:11am instead of 9:00am. I've placed the departing flight below for your review.

Similar to prior requests in connection with the Epstein investigation (2018R01618), we'd like to please request 
permission to travel next week for an interview in West Palm Beach on November 4. It will just be me and 
and we'll travel some combination of the 3rd to the 5th. And also same as last time, we'd like to ask permission to 
reserve a conference room at the hotel on that Monday for the interview, please. 
thanks very much,

Again in connection with the Epstein investigation, we'd like to please request permission to travel for approximately 
three days next week for meetings and interviews in West Palm Beach, Florida. As of now we tentatively expect to fly 
down Tuesday night and return on Wednesday or Thursday (and will keep the timeframe as short as scheduling

Unfortunately we're still trying to pin down timing for interviewing the victims, so depending on the timing it will 
either be me and

It appears the USAO of the SDNY suspected that Mr. Epstein was not disclosing all his international travel. I 
would like to ask about that. 
-What made the SDNY believe that Epstein may have been violating IML? 
-Were there prior reports that he may have violated IML? 
-Were there other investigations of Epstein's compliance with his obligations as a sex offender of concern to 
the SDNY or DOJ over the years? 
-In my review of Jeffrey Epstein's flight logs obtained from the FAA, the two flights, one to Vienna, Austria 
and the second to Monaco, were not logged in FAA records. 
-Was there any indication that Epstein took steps to conceal certain flights from being tracked by U.S. 
authorities? (the Vienna and Monaco flights were picked up from "crowd-sourcing"). 
-Does the SDNY believe Epstein had advanced knowledge he would be arrested? 
-Would the SDNY provide any reports detailing how the FBI and NYPD took him into custody...details about 
the arrest itself? (e.g., Before or after he went through customs?)

No problem at all, we understand this takes time, and we appreciate you getting back to us, and we're very grateful that 
your client is open to speaking with us. 
On your questions, we are certainly fine with the first two questions / requests — we're happy to meet with you and your 
client in an initial conversation, during which we can do the kind of introductions and explanations we've done with you 
(and that we do with all victim witnesses we meet), including answering any questions to the best of our ability, and 
then to take a break and have a more substantive discussion later on.

Regarding the friend, does that individual also represent her as counsel? We aren't normally able to include individuals 
in addition to the witness and counsel in an interview—what does sometimes work is for someone who is providing 
support (a parent, friend, etc.) to be close by for any discussions, assistance, etc. anytime that a witness wants to speak 
with that person, which would of course be totally fine in this instance. Or if he represents her in his capacity as an 
attorney then he of course could be in the interview in that role (with the only caveat that we would just want to 
confirm that he himself is not separately a witness of some sort in the case). We unfortunately are not able to pay for 
third parties (including counsel) to travel in connection with witness interviews, though — if it's preferable, we certainly 
could pay for your client's travel to the U.S. for the interview, including airfare and lodging, if that makes it easier for the 
friend to be present? And we're happy to discuss any of this further by email or phone if that's useful — I'll be at my 
desk for the next several hours and most of tomorrow, at 
or we could also set a time to chat, whatever 
would be helpful.

Hello
Apologies for the slight delay. My client is willing to help but asks the following: 
• 
That there be a morning meeting at which introductions with a discussion as to the investigation and my clients 
involvement. I appreciate that you have explained this to me but I think further verbal clarification would assist. 
• 
In the afternoon and after a break, my client would be willing to answer questions, in so far as she can. 
• 
That a friend of hers be allowed to be present as well. However that friend is based in the US and would need to 
be flown over to London. He is a US lawyer. 
Perhaps you could let me know if this is possible? 
Kind regards, 
Jill

Jill, 
Following up on our phone call, thank you for talking with us again, and we wanted to get back to you regarding some 
of the additional follow-up questions you asked, and to describe in more detail for your client how we would expect to 
approach any discussion with your client if she were comfortable meeting with us. 
The absolute most important thing is that any discussion would be entirely voluntary, and by that we mean the 
decision to meet with us but also as to any topic or question—your client would be absolutely free to determine what 
topics she felt comfortable discussing. There is absolutely no pressure on victim witnesses to address anything that 
would make them uncomfortable at any time, and even if your client was willing to meet with us, we would tell her, as 
we do for any witness, that if any topic comes up that she wants to skip, or discuss with you privately, that is no 
problem at all. 
In fact, if you and she would prefer, we would be happy to have a meeting where we simply introduced ourselves, 
explained the status of our investigation, talked about how a discussion would proceed if your client ended up being 
comfortable with that, and answered in person any questions she. We have done that previously, where we do the 
talking rather than asking questions in an initial meeting, and that would of course be without any requirement for 
anything additional if she preferred not to. As I mentioned on the phone, we have consistently found that we are able 
EFTA00023285
--- PAGE 4 ---
to reassure individuals when we have the opportunity to meet in person so they can see directly our interest in 
approaching these discussions with great sensitivity and care. As I also mentioned on the phone, even if your client 
were willing to speak with us, there would be absolutely no need or requirement for her to talk about any assault or 
victimization she experienced. We wrote in our first email that we would primarily be interested in talking about 
topics such as the general scope of her employment, directions she received from Epstein or Maxwell, etc., and as 
always we would be guided by her comfort level. 
In terms of who would attend a meeting, we almost always work in pairs, so two prosecutors and two officers, and 
that's not to have extra people, but rather because it helps us to be as efficient as we can, and so witnesses can meet 
the people on the team. Our team is also majority female, and we always tell witnesses that if topics come up in a 
discussion that they would prefer to speak about just with women, that's fine and we can be flexible in the moment 
and are always guided by the comfort level of the victim. But I also want to stress that in terms of your client in 
particular, we don't expect to initially address issues of a very personal or sexual nature, and we certainly would tell 
you in advance if there came a time when we thought that might be important to address, and how we could facilitate 
that. Who exactly from our team would be at any meeting would depend on schedules, but we can assure you that 
every one of us has now spoken with dozens of victims in this case, and every one of us has extensive experience more 
generally working with victims and working on cases involving sex offenses. We are proud of how we have been able 
to work with victims in this case especially, given all of the circumstances, and we absolutely would take the same 
sensitive approach with your client as we have with the many other victims in this case who have spoken with us. 
Again, if it would be helpful even for us to just come to the U.K. and introduce ourselves and explain in person how our 
process works, and answer any questions your client has in person, we would absolutely be happy to do that with no 
obligation at all from her. We also could do that with the possibility that if she felt comfortable, we could just address 
the general subject of her employment, for example. But no obligation and no pressure. We continue to appreciate 
your and her willingness to even broach the possibility of a discussion, and we hope this is helpful. 
thank you very much,

Subject: RE: Epstein investigation 
Thanks for circling back, and we'll do our best to answer these questions. In terms of who would be in the room, the 
most likely answer is that it would be two of the prosecutors and the two law enforcement officers on the case. The 
only reason I saw "most likely" rather than having a definitive answer is that when we're interviewing in a foreign 
country, it sometimes is the case the local law enforcement also insists on having representatives present. I don't 
believe that's required in the U.K., but we can check on it and give you a definitive answer in the coming days if that's 
useful. (Also, if she preferred to be interviewed in the U.S., we certainly could guarantee that the room would be just 
the case team, and we could arrange for travel and lodging for her. Let us know if that's the case, but otherwise we're 
of course happy to travel to her.) 
EFTA00023286
--- PAGE 5 ---
Regarding access to notes, it would principally be the investigative team—so again, the prosecutors and the FBI team 
working on the case. Our respective supervisors also theoretically have access to our files, but the reports are not 
generally widely disseminated. The basic logistics are that an agent takes notes during an interview, and then types up 
those notes into a formal report (called an FBI Form 302). We don't ordinarily share notes with other entities, but I 
can also check on that to see if I can make a more specific representation with respect to your client. 
With respect to anonymity, I confess that I'm not familiar with the distinction you're referring to. In terms of our 
investigation, we don't publicly disclose the names of individuals we meet with, and we don't disclose to any other 
witnesses, for example, the identities of victims or witnesses we are meeting with. (And our policies on that don't 
change even for individuals who are in the position of your client, who have been widely publicly reported to have 
been connected to Epstein and/or his employees or associates). But if that doesn't answer your question, we're of 
course happy to discuss further. Let me know if it might be useful to have a call? Or if not, also happy to address any 
follow-up via email. 
thanks,

Thanks for this. I've been asked who would be in the room and thereafter who would have access to any 
notes made. Would her permission be sought before disclosing to any other parties or officials? 
As you know there is a real difficulty in relation to her anonymity in the US versus the UK. Are you able to 
provide any comfort on this?

Thank you again for speaking with us earlier today regarding our interest in talking with your client in connection 
with our investigation into the conduct of Jeffrey Epstein. 
As requested, we wanted to briefly memorialize our current views and understandings of your client, and also to 
reiterate our interest in approaching any discussion with great care and sensitivity, particularly to avoid adding to her 
trauma or causing re-victimization. 
As we mentioned on the phone, your client is not a target of our investigation—it sounds like the analogue in the 
U.K. may be the "suspect" category—and we currently do not have reason to believe that she has committed any 
U.S. federal crime. As we discussed, our knowledge of your client specifically is somewhat limited, having never 
spoken to her—and therefore knowing about her only through other witnesses and records—but it certainly has 
been our experience that the overwhelming majority of young women and girls who were in the orbit of Jeffrey 
Epstein during the relevant periods were subject to his abuse. It does not surprise us, nor do we have any trouble 
believing, that your client was similarly a victim. I hope that is helpful in understanding the capacity in which we 
hope to speak with her. 
Separately, and as we also discussed, any discussion with our team would be entirely voluntary—and that extends 
not just to whether she would be willing to meet with us at all, but also including her ability to decline to discuss 
particular topics or even particular questions, and to talk with her counsel at any time, to take any breaks that would 
be beneficial while we're meeting, etc. 
In terms of topic areas, we would be hoping to learn about the general narrative of her interactions with Epstein and 
his other associates and employees, including Ghislaine Maxwell, whom we understand she may have worked 
directly for. That would broadly include how she came to be in contact with them, the nature and scope of her 
employment, any instructions she was given relating to other women or girls, and just generally her experiences and 
observations in interacting with them. We ordinarily would also be interested in understanding the general nature of 
the abuse she was subjected to, but I want to emphasize that we would not need to discuss with her the specifics if 
she weren't comfortable with that, and in particular we often don't even broach that subject in a first meeting. 
Please let us know if you have any additional questions, and in particular whether any other information from us 
would be useful, and we look forward to speaking with you again soon.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
JANE DOE 1000, 
Plaintiff, 
CASE NO: 
v. 
DARREN K. INDYKE and RICHARD D. KAHN, 
in their capacities as the executors of the 
ESTATE OF JEFFREY EDWARD EPSTEIN, 
Defendants. 
COMPLAINT 
BOIES SCHILLER FLEXNER LLP 
EFTA00023292
--- PAGE 2 ---
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF Document 1 Filed 11/14/19 Page 2 of 14 
Plaintiff Jane Doe 1000, by her attorneys Boies Schiller Flexner LLP, for her Complaint 
against Defendants, Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn in their capacities as the executors of 
the Estate of Jeffrey Edward Epstein ("Epstein"), avers upon personal knowledge as to her own 
acts and status and upon information and belief and to all other matters as follows: 
NATURE OF THE ACTION 
1. 
This suit arises out of Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse of Plaintiff. 
2. 
Jane Doe 1000 was sexually trafficked by Epstein as part of his organized ring of 
procuring young and underage girls for sex. One of Epstein's co-conspirators contacted Jane 
Doe after a modeling appearance and arranged to have Jane Doe meet Epstein under the false 
pretense that he was involved in the modeling industry and wanted to interview her about 
opportunities. Rather than help her with her modeling career, Epstein manipulated and 
intimidated Jane Doe and subjected her to years of sexual abuse in his New York mansion. 
3. 
Epstein's trafficking scheme involved recruiting young females by making false promises 
and using his wealth, power and threats to intimidate the females into submission to his 
demands. This same pattern was repeated numerous times with numerous young women. 
4. 
As United States District Judge Kenneth Marra found, "From between about 1999 and 
2007, Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused more than 30 minor girls . . . at his mansion in Palm Beach 
Florida, and elsewhere in the United States and overseas. . . . In addition to his own sexual abuse 
of the victims, Epstein directed other persons to abuse the girls sexually. Epstein used paid 
employees to find and bring minor girls to him. Epstein worked in concert with others to obtain 
minors not only for his own sexual gratification, but also for the sexual gratification of others." 
Doe 1 v. United States, 359 F. Supp. 3d 1201, 1204 (S.D. Fla. 2019) (internal citations omitted). 
EFTA00023293
--- PAGE 3 ---
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF Document 1 Filed 11/14/19 Page 3 of 14 
5. 
Epstein organized this sex trafficking network to obtain hundreds of young females for 
himself for sex, and also lent these females out to other powerful and wealthy individuals to be 
sexually abused. 
6. 
Epstein conspired with others and hired staff to maintain and keep secret this network of 
sexual abuse for years, which sprawled throughout Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, 
New Mexico, the United States Virgin Islands, and Paris. Epstein's preference was to have three 
different young females a day for his sexual pleasure. 
7. 
Despite his significant criminal activity, in 2008 Epstein received a shockingly minimal 
charge pleading guilty to a single Florida state law charge of procuring a minor for prostitution 
and a non-prosecution agreement (a "NPA") with the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of 
Florida. Unknown to the public and the victims at the time, Epstein's lawyers were pressuring 
the Government to commit to the NPA without informing the victims. Epstein's multiple 
victims were kept in the dark and told to be "patient" while Epstein's lawyers worked to protect 
him and other potential co-conspirators from prosecution. Epstein served one year in jail, but 
was afforded the privilege of being able to leave the jail to go to work for twelve hours per day, 
six days per week. 
8. 
The NPA allowed Epstein to escape proportionate punishment for his actions and to 
continue operating his sex trafficking enterprise with liberty. 
9. 
A few years later, Epstein flippantly referred to his sexual abuse of multiple minors, and 
the slap on the wrist he had received for it, in a 2011 interview with the New York Post: 
"Billionaire pervert Jeffrey Epstein is back in New York City — and making wisecracks about his 
just-ended jail stint for having sex with an underage girl. 'I am not a sexual predator, I'm an 
offender,' the financier told The Post yesterday. 'It's the difference between a murderer and a 
EFTA00023294

Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF Document 1 Filed 11/14/19 Page 4 of 14 
person who steals a bagel,' said Epstein." Amber Sutherland, Billionaire Jeffrey Epstein: I'm a 
Sex Offender Not a Predator, N.Y. Post (Feb. 25, 2011), 
https://nypost.com/2011/02/25/billionaire-jeffrey-epstein-im-a-sex-offender-not-a-predatort 
10. 
In August 2018, just one year before his death, Epstein told a New York Times reporter 
"that criminalizing sex with teenage girls was a cultural aberration and that at times in history it 
was perfectly acceptable." James B. Stewart, The Day Jeffrey Epstein Told Me He Had Dirt on 
Powerful People, N.Y. Times (Aug. 12, 2019), 
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/12/business/jeffrey-epstein-interview.html. 
II. 
When Plaintiff was a young woman, Epstein added her to his long list of victims by 
committing sexual assault and battery against her. As such, Epstein is responsible for battery 
and intentional infliction of emotional distress pursuant to New York common law. The damage 
to Plaintiff has been severe and lasting. 
12. 
This action has been timely filed pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 215(8)(a), which provides 
that a plaintiff shall have at least one year from the termination of a criminal action against the 
same defendant to commence an action with respect to the event or occurrence from which the 
criminal action arose. A criminal action against Epstein with respect to the same sex trafficking 
enterprise from which Plaintiff's claims arise was terminated on August 29, 2019. 
13. 
This action has also been timely filed pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 213-C, which provides 
that a plaintiff shall have 20 years to file civil claims "for physical, psychological or other injury 
or condition suffered by such person as a result of conduct which would constitute" certain sex 
crimes under New York Penal Law Article 130. Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell sexually 
assaulted Plaintiff by forcible compulsion within 20 years of filing this Complaint, and that 
sexual assault constitutes one or more sex crimes described in N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 213-C. 
EFTA00023295
--- PAGE 5 ---
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF Document 1 Filed 11/14/19 Page 5 of 14 
14. 
Any statute of limitations applicable to Plaintiff's claims, if any, is tolled due to the 
continuous and active deception, duress, threats of retaliation, and other forms of misconduct that 
Epstein and his co-conspirators used to silence his many victims, including Plaintiff. Epstein's 
actions deprived Plaintiff of the opportunity to commence this lawsuit before his death. Until his 
death, Plaintiff feared that Epstein and his co-conspirators would harm her or her family, or ruin 
her life, if she came forward. 
15. 
Defendants are equitably estopped from asserting a statute of limitations defense. 
Allowing Defendants to do so would be unjust. Epstein and his co-conspirators intimidated each 
of his victims into silence by threatening their lives and their livelihoods. They therefore 
prevented Plaintiff from commencing this lawsuit before his death. By using threats, along with 
his wealth and power, Epstein was able to escape punishment for his intolerable and brutal 
crimes against countless young women and underage girls for the duration of his life. 
PARTIES 
16. 
Plaintiff Jane Doe 1000 is a citizen and resident of New Jersey. 
17. 
Defendant Darren K. Indyke is sued in his capacity as an appointed executor of the Estate 
of Jeffrey E. Epstein. 
18. 
Defendant Richard D. Kahn is sued in his capacity as an appointed executor of the Estate 
of Jeffrey E. Epstein. 
JURISDICTION AND VENUE 
19. 
Jeffrey Epstein was a citizen of the United States domiciled in the U.S. Virgin Islands at 
the time of his death. Jeffrey Epstein maintained a residence in the Southern District of New 
York. As the legal representatives of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, Darren K. Indyke and 
Richard D. Kahn are deemed citizens of the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
EFTA00023296
--- PAGE 6 ---
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF Document 1 Filed 11/14/19 Page 6 of 14 
20. 
The amount in controversy in this action exceeds the sum or value of $75,000.00 
excluding interests and costs and is between citizens of different states. Accordingly, jurisdiction 
is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1332. 
21. 
Venue is proper in this Court as Epstein's sexual abuse of Plaintiff began and occurred in 
New York, New York, where he recruited her, physically molested her, and began grooming her 
for sex in his organized sex trafficking ring. 
22. 
Many of the events giving rise to these causes of action occurred in the Southern District 
of New York, where a substantial amount of Epstein's property is located. Thus, venue in this 
district is proper. 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2). 
FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 
A. 
Epstein's Sex Trafficking Enterprise 
23. 
Jeffrey Epstein was widely renowned as a billionaire who used his vast connections to 
powerful individuals, and seemingly unlimited wealth and resources, to create a web of 
transcontinental sex trafficking that served himself, his coconspirators, and some of the most 
powerful people in the world. 
24. 
Epstein owned multiple residences and frequently travelled between them, including at 9 
East 71" Street, New York, New York 10021, where the illegal sexual crimes against Plaintiff 
occurred. Epstein conservatively valued his New York townhome at $55,931,000.00. Epstein 
conservatively valued his ranch at 49 Zorro Ranch Road, Stanley, New Mexico 87056, at 
$17,246,208.00. In addition, Epstein owned residences in the Virgin Islands, Florida, France, 
and even on his own island, Great St. James Island, where his transcontinental sex trafficking of 
hundreds of young girls servicing him, his co-conspirators, and wealthy and powerful individuals 
around the world occurred. 
EFTA00023297
--- PAGE 7 ---
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF Document 1 Filed 11/14/19 Page 7 of 14 
25. 
The allegations herein concern Epstein's tortious acts against Plaintiff while in New 
York, where Epstein was staying at his mansion. 
26. 
At all times material to this cause of action, Jeffrey Epstein utilized his seemingly 
unlimited power, wealth, and resources, as well as his deep connections to powerful and 
politically connected individuals to intimidate and manipulate his victims of sexual abuse. 
27. 
Epstein and his co-conspirators had perfected a scheme for manipulation and abuse of 
young females. As part of the scheme, a female "recruiter" would approach a young female and 
strike up a conversation in an effort to quickly learn about the young female's background and 
any vulnerabilities they could expose. The recruiter would then manipulate the young female 
into coming back to one of Epstein's residences by offering the young female something she 
needed. At times the recruiter's lure would be a modeling opportunity, money for education, 
help for the young female's family, and a whole host of other related offers depending on their 
target's situation. Once in the residence, the recruiter and Epstein would work in concert to 
impress and intimidate the young female with displays of vast wealth, including having 
employees that were butlers and maids formally dressed around the house. They would also 
strategically place photographs of very powerful political and social figures amongst 
photographs and art displaying nude females in an effort to normalize the sexual abuse. They 
would also normalize the sexual abuse by placing a massage table and spa related products 
around the massage area in an effort to legitimize the area where the abuse was set to occur. 
Once abused, Epstein and his co-conspirators continued to manipulate the victims, using their 
financial power, promises, and threats to ensure that the victim returned as directed and remained 
compliant with their demands.

B. 
The Arrest, Prosecution, and Death of Epstein 
28. 
The sexual trafficking ring described herein started at least as early as 1995 and 
continued up until at least July 2, 2019, when the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District 
of New York ("SDNY") charged Epstein with sex trafficking conspiracy and sex trafficking in 
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591. He was arrested on July 8, 2019, pursuant to the SDNY's Sealed 
Two Count Indictment, which is attached as Exhibit A. 
29. 
The Indictment described Epstein's conduct and his abuse and trafficking of females in 
the same trafficking operation he used to abuse and traffic Plaintiff. 
30. 
Epstein's last will and testament (the "Will") was executed on August 8, 2019, at the 
Metropolitan Correctional Center. The witnesses were Martel Colon Miro and Gulnora Tali. The 
Will included affidavits from Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn, in which they swear an 
"Oath of Willingness to Serve as Executor and Appointment of Local Counsel." 
31. 
Epstein was found dead in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center on August 10, 
2019. 
32. 
Epstein's last will and testament was filed on August 15, 2019, in the Probate Division of 
the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands. 
33. 
Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn filed a Certificate of Trust in the Superior Court 
of the Virgin Islands for Epstein's 1953 Trust on August 26, 2019. See Certificate of Trust, In 
the Matter of the Estate of Jetey E. Epstein, Probate No. ST-19-PB-80 (Super. Ct. V.I. Aug. 26, 
2019). 
34. 
Epstein's will was entered into probate on September 6, 2019, and the Superior Court of 
the Virgin Islands accordingly authorized Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn to administer 
Epstein's estate. See Order for Probate, In the Matter of the Estate ofJqffrey E. Epstein, Probate 
EFTA00023299
--- PAGE 9 ---
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF Document 1 Filed 11/14/19 Page 9 of 14 
No. ST-19-PB-80 (Super. Ct. V.I. Sept. 6, 2019); Letters Testamentary, In the Matter of the 
Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, Probate No. ST-19-PB-80 (Super. Ct. V.I. Sept. 6, 2019). 
35. 
The Will's first article directs Epstein's executors "to pay from my estate all expenses of 
my last illness, my funeral and burial expenses, the administration expenses of my estate and all 
of my debts duly proven and allowed against my estate." The Will further directs that "after the 
payments and distributions provided in Article FIRST," Epstein "give[s] all of my property, real 
and personal, wherever situated...to the then acting Trustees of The 1953 Trust." 
36. 
Following Epstein's death, SDNY submitted a proposed nolle prosequi order in the 
criminal matter against him because it was required by law to do so after Epstein was deceased. 
On August 29, 2019, U.S. District Judge Richard Berman formally dismissed SDNY's 
indictment against Epstein, terminating the criminal action against him. Plaintiff's claims are 
therefore timely under N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 215(8)(a). 
C. 
Jane Doe 1000 
37. 
Jane Doe 1000 grew up in extreme poverty. At various times throughout her childhood, 
her mother had been homeless. Jane Doe was unable to enroll in high school because she did not 
have a residence and often lived without running water or electricity. 
38. 
In late 1999, Jane Doe made a modeling appearance. A man called her and told her that 
Jeffrey Epstein had connections to various modeling jobs and asked her if she would like to meet 
with Epstein to discuss opportunities. The opportunity sounded enticing to Jane Doe, so she 
agreed and met Epstein at his New York City mansion on 7 Is" Street. 
39. 
Upon meeting Jane Doe, Epstein offered her a position modeling with Victoria's Secret, a 
lingerie retailer. He explained that he was friends with Les Wexner, the chief executive of 
EFTA00023300
--- PAGE 10 ---
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF Document 1 Filed 11/14/19 Page 10 of 14 
Victoria's Secret's parent company. Epstein reiterated his connection to Victoria's Secret each 
time he saw and spoke with Jane Doe. 
40. 
Eventually, Epstein moved Jane Doe into his apartment building on 66'h Street, where he 
housed other models and young women that he sexually abused, so that he could have complete 
control over her life. Her relationship with Epstein quickly turned into one of sexual abuse. 
Ghislaine Maxwell, one of Epstein's main "recruiters," along with additional unidentified 
co-conspirators, would call Jane Doe and direct her to go to Epstein's mansion to give him a 
massage. The massages quickly escalated into Epstein forcing himself on Jane Doe against her 
will and engaging in one or more sex act with her for his own sexual gratification. Jane Doe was 
terrified of Epstein, who repeatedly threatened her and made representations about his wealth, 
power, and connections. 
41. 
During Jane Doe's time with Epstein, he forced her to give him sexual massages and 
made her use sex toys. 
42. 
Epstein also flew Jane Doe to his residence in Palm Beach, Florida, where she was also 
forced to give Epstein sexual massages. 
43. 
On one occasion, Epstein forced Jane Doe to meet with a lawyer, even though she did not 
express any need for a lawyer to Epstein. The lawyer she met with was a prominent attorney and 
a law professor who was described to Jane Doe as Epstein's close friend and lawyer. The 
lawyer appeared to be interviewing her, asking personal questions about her family's financial 
situation. The meeting had no legal purpose, and Epstein later used the information that the 
lawyer had obtained through his meeting with Jane Doe to intimidate her and to keep her 
compliant in his sex-trafficking scheme. 
EFTA00023301
--- PAGE 11 ---
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF Document 1 Filed 11/14/19 Page 11 of 14 
44. 
Epstein made very clear to Jane Doe that he was incredibly wealthy, powerful and 
regularly in contact with world leaders. In fact, in his New York mansion he had photographs 
displayed of significant political figures to ensure that any young female entering the home 
would know that he had extensive government connections. Epstein was not to be disobeyed and 
he made clear by his words and actions that there would be consequences if Jane Doe did not 
comply with his demands. 
45. 
Epstein constantly promised Jane Doe modeling opportunities with Victoria's Secret each 
time she saw him. He continued to make that promise for years, up until the last time Jane Doe 
saw Epstein. 
46. 
One day, Epstein had someone call Jane Doe to his mansion. When Jane Doe arrived, 
Maxwell was waiting for her and led her upstairs to Epstein's master bedroom. When they got to 
the bedroom, sex toys were laid out on the bed. Epstein and Maxwell proceeded to sexually 
assault Jane Doe simultaneously and by forcible compulsion. Maxwell forcibly penetrated Jane 
Doe with a sex toy. She was horrified and terrified by the experience and knew she had to try to 
get away from Epstein even though she risked harm to herself by disobeying Epstein. She 
proceeded to move out of the 66th Street apartment building and, having nowhere else to go, 
found shelter at the Salvation Army housing facility. 
47. 
Jane Doe was deeply affected by her harrowing experiences at the hands of Epstein. She 
suffers extreme emotional distress from an experience that has affected her for her entire life. 
48. 
Epstein's sexual assault and battery of Jane Doe continues to cause her significant 
distress and harm.

Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF Document 1 Filed 11/14/19 Page 12 of 14 
FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION 
(Battery) 
49. 
Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges the allegations stated above in paragraphs 1-48 as if fully 
set forth herein. 
50. 
Epstein intentionally committed battery by sexually assaulting Plaintiff when she was a 
young woman. As described above, on multiple occasions, Epstein intentionally sexually 
assaulted and touched Plaintiff in an offensive and sexual manner without her consent. 
51. 
Epstein's actions constitute sexual offenses as defined in New York Penal Law Article 
130, including but not limited to Article 130.35, inasmuch as Epstein and Maxwell sexually 
assaulted Plaintiff by forcible compulsion within 20 years of filing this Complaint. See N.Y. 
C.P.L.R. § 213-C. 
52. 
A criminal action against Epstein with respect to the same sex trafficking enterprise from 
which Plaintiff's first cause of action arises was terminated on August 29, 2019, less than one 
year prior to the filing of this Complaint. See N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 215(8)(a). 
53. 
As a direct and proximate result of Epstein's conduct, Plaintiff has in the past and will in 
the future continue to suffer extreme emotional distress, humiliation, fear, psychological trauma, 
loss of dignity and self-esteem, and invasion of her privacy. 
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION 
(Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress) 
54. 
Plaintiff repeats and re-alleges the allegations stated above in paragraphs 1-48 as if fully 
set forth herein. 
55. 
As a direct result of these allegations as stated, Epstein committed intentional infliction of 
emotional distress against Plaintiff. 
EFTA00023303
--- PAGE 13 ---
Case 1:19-cv-10577-LJL-DCF Document 1 Filed 11/14/19 Page 13 of 14 
56. 
Epstein's actions, described above, constitute extreme and outrageous conduct that 
shocks the conscience. Epstein's plan to recruit, entice, and assault Plaintiff on multiple 
occasions goes beyond all possible bounds of decency and is intolerable in a civilized 
community. 
57. 
Epstein knew or disregarded the substantial likelihood that these actions would cause 
Plaintiff severe emotional distress. 
58. 
A criminal action against Epstein with respect to the same sex trafficking enterprise from 
which Plaintiff's second cause of action arises was terminated on August 29, 2019, less than one 
year prior to the filing of this Complaint. See N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 215(8)(a). 
59. 
As a direct and proximate result of Epstein's conduct, Plaintiff has in the past and will in 
the future continue to suffer extreme emotional distress, humiliation, fear, psychological trauma, 
loss of dignity and self-esteem, and invasion of her privacy. 
PRAYER FOR RELIEF 
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests judgment against Defendants, awarding 
compensatory, consequential, exemplary, and punitive damages in an amount to be determined at 
trial; costs of suit; attorneys' fees; and such other and further relief as the Court may deem just 
and proper. 
JURY DEMAND 
Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all causes of action asserted within this 
pleading.

I confirmed with our client that she is willing to speak with you and wants to fully cooperate with the

Please let us know if you would like to speak with our client. We are happy to facilitate this

Teri, 
Thanks for being in touch. In the first instance, before we would request an interview 
directly, it would be helpful for us to get a full attorney proffer from you about what the 
EFTA00023322
--- PAGE 6 ---
client's information is, what you expect she would convey in an interview, any relevant 
documentary or other corroborating materials, etc. That way we can make sure we're not 
re-victimizing any individual unnecessarily, and be efficient with any necessary follow-up 
interview of the individual him- or herself. Please let us know when a good time would be 
for an attorney proffer? And we can figure out scheduling. 
thanks very much,

Re: 
Request for Tangible and Documentary Evidence (Touhy Request) 
v. Darren K. Indyke, et al., SDNY Case No. 1:19-cv-07625 
In follow up to our previous communications, please accept this as our formal written request for 
documentary and tangible evidence currently in the in the possession, custody, and control of the 
Department of Justice by way of the Southern District of New York relating to the sexual abuse of 
one of Jeffrey Epstein's many victims, M.' See United States ex rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 
462 (1951). We make this written request pursuant to the Touhy regulations codified as 28 C.F.R. 
§ 16.21 et seq. Should you find there to be any deficiencies within this request, please notify us 
and we will do what is necessary to correct any such shortcomings. 
• 
was sexually assaulted by prolific pedophile, Jeffrey Epstein, on two occasions in 2000, when 
she was only 15 years old, record of which we believe is currently in the Government's possession 
as a result of the investigation that was conducted into Epstein's criminal activity relating to the 
sexual abuse of minor children. Given the highly relevant nature of this tangible evidence to 
currently pending litigation, we request production of documentary evidence relating to 
order to enable her to prove her claims from both a liability and damages standpoint.

' To protect her anonymity, our client has elected to proceed as a E. As such, we have referred to her 
herein using the pseudonym under which she has filed her lawsuit. To the extent that her identity is not 
already known by the prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, please contact us at your earliest 
convenience to discuss her true identity.

We specifically seek copies of the following documents that we believe are currently in the 
possession of the Government: 
I) Photographs of.;

Pursuant to the Touhy regulations set forth by the Department of Justice, the Deputy or Associate 
Attorney General assesses the following considerations in determining whether disclosure is 
warranted: 
(a)( I ) Whether such disclosure is appropriate under the rules of procedure 
governing the case or mater in which the demand arose; 
(a)(2) Whether disclosure is appropriate under the relevant substantive law of 
privilege. This request satisfies both of these considerations. As explained 
previously, the requested non-privileged documentary evidence directly concerns 
the allegations in Doe's civil case. 
Due to the establishment of the Epstein Victim Compensation Program that is currently underway,

claim for consideration, and if necessary, to continue to proceed by way of formal litigation. The

information prohibited by statute or regulation. Furthermore, this request does not seek 
information that is classified or that would reveal the source or identity of any informant. To that 
effect, E 
specifically does not request any investigatory records compiled for law enforcement 
purposes that would interfere with ongoing law enforcement proceedings. U 
simply requests 
information in the Government's possession that will assist in the prosecution of her claims and 
ultimately, aid in her ability to finally obtain thejEstice that she deserves. To the extent that the 
requested materials can be made available to 
on an expedited basis, it would be greatly 
appreciated.

Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
SOD Third Avenue 
New York, NY 10022 
+1 212 957 7600 phone 
wyny.cohencressercom 
We write on behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, in opposition to the government's 
October 6, 2020 letter requesting the Court's permission to delay the disclosure of photographs 
and documents relating to certain alleged victims of sexual abuse by Jeffrey Epstein (the 
"Materials"), pursuant to Rule 16(d)(1) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. (Dkt. 60). 
The government's request should be denied for two reasons. 
First, it is clear from the government's letter that the Materials pertain to individuals who 
claim to have been "sexually abused by [Jeffrey] Epstein" (id. at 2), but who have not accused Ms. 
Maxwell of participating in or facilitating that conduct in any way. Accordingly, the Materials 
identifying these witnesses and their prior statements are exculpatory evidence, which must be 
disclosed pursuant to the government's obligations under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963) 
and its progeny.' 
Second, the Court should order the government to disclose the Materials under Rule 16 
because the Materials are "material to preparing the defense" and the government has not shown 
good cause to delay production of the Materials under Rule 16(d)(1). 
I We note that yesterday we sent the government a letter making specific Brady requests, including "[a]ny statements 
or written communications made by any witness who has alleged that she was sexually abused or assaulted by Mr. 
Epstein, but has not alleged that Ms. Maxwell participated in, was involved in, or facilitated the alleged sexual abuse."

A. Applicable Law 
1. Brady 
"Under Brady and its progeny, `the Government has a constitutional duty to disclose 
favorable evidence to the accused where such evidence is `material' either to guilt or to 
punishment."' United States v. Cert(fled Envtl. Servs., Inc., 753 F.3d 72, 91 (2d Cir. 2014) 
(quoting United States v. Coppa, 267 F.3d 132, 139 (2d Cir. 2001)). "Favorable evidence" that 
must be disclosed for purposes of Brady "includes not only evidence that tends to exculpate the 
accused, but also evidence that is useful to impeach the credibility of a government witness," id., 
also known as "Giglio material," as well as any statements of witnesses "which are contradictory 
or inconsistent with the government's theory of the case." United States v. Harris, No. 00 Cr. 105 
(RPP), 2000 WL 1273720, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 7, 2000) (citing Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419 
(1995). 
2. Rule 16 
Rule 16 provides, in pertinent part: 
Upon a defendant's request, the government must permit the 
defendant to inspect and to copy or photograph books, papers, 
documents, data, photographs, tangible objects, buildings or 
places, or copies or portions of any of these items, if the item is 
within the government's possession, custody, or control and . . . the 
item is material to preparing the defense[.] 
Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(1)(E). Evidence is material under Rule 16 if it "could be used to counter 
the government's case or to bolster a defense." United States v. Stevens, 985 F.2d 1175, 1180 (2d 
Cir. 1993). "The materiality standard [of Rule 16] normally is not a heavy burden; rather, 
evidence is material as long as there is a strong indication that it will play an important role in 
uncovering admissible evidence, aiding witness preparation, corroborating testimony, or assisting 
impeachment or rebuttal." United States v. Stein, 488 F. Supp. 2d 350, 356-57 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) 
(quoting United States v. Lloyd, 992 F.2d 348, 351 (D.C. Cir.1993) (internal quotation marks 
omitted)). 
Rule 16(d)(1) provides that a party may seek a protective order from the court to "deny, 
restrict, or defer discovery" upon a showing of "good cause." Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(d)(1). To 
establish good cause, the party must show "that disclosure will result in a clearly defined, specific 
and serious injury." United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 506, 523 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (citations 
omitted). A finding of harm "must be based on a particular factual demonstration of potential 
harm, not on conclusory statements." Id. (citations omitted).

B. Discussion 
1. The Materials Are Subject to Disclosure Under Brady Because They Refute the 
Government's Theory of the Charged Crimes 
The government states that, as part of its "broader investigation into Epstein's sexual abuse 
of minors," it interviewed "dozens" of alleged victims of Epstein's sexual abuse and obtained 
sensitive documents and photographs from certain alleged victims who claim they were assaulted 
after 1997 — i.e., after the end of the time period charged in Counts One through Four of the 
superseding indictment (the "Indictment"). (Dkt. 60 at 2). Stated differently, the government has 
interviewed and collected evidence from numerous witnesses who have never asserted that Ms. 
Maxwell participated in Epstein's alleged sexual abuse, or "groomed" them for Epstein, or had 
anything whatsoever to do with any episode of sexual abuse they may have experienced. 
Although the government represents that these women were sexually abused by Epstein after the 
time period charged in Counts One through Four of the Indictment, this evidence is still 
fundamentally inconsistent with the government's theory that Ms. Maxwell was Epstein's 
"madam" and the principal facilitator of his sexual abuse scheme. 
Furthermore, this evidence directly contradicts the government's theory of the perjury 
counts. The government insists that the Materials are irrelevant to the charges in the Indictment 
because they relate to instances of sexual abuse that took place after 1997, and therefore "post-date 
the time period charged in the Indictment." (Dkt. 60 at 2). That is incorrect. The government 
forgets that it chose to put at issue Epstein's sexual abuse that occurred after 1997 when it 
included the perjury counts in the Indictment. 
The perjury counts stem from a defamation suit brought against Ms. Maxwell in 2015 by 
one of Epstein's alleged victims ("Accuser-1"). In December 2014, Accuser-1 filed a motion to 
join a lawsuit challenging the validity of Epstein's Non-Prosecution Agreement executed in 2007. 
Accuser-I's motion "described Maxwell's role as one of the main women who Epstein used to 
procure under-aged girls for sexual activities and a primary co-conspirator and participant in his 
sexual abuse and sex trafficking scheme." ((Accuser-I] v. Maxwell, 15-CV-07433 (RWS) 
(S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. 1 at ¶ 27). Ms. Maxwell publicly denied Accuser-l's allegations, claiming that 
they were untrue. Accuser-1, in turn, claimed that these statements were defamatory and sued Ms. 
Maxwell. 
Counts Five and Six allege that Ms. Maxwell lied at two different depositions in this case. 
The scope of these depositions was not limited to the 1994-1997 timeframe. On the contrary, Ms. 
Maxwell was asked questions about, among other things, her knowledge of Epstein's sexual 
activities in general. Whether Ms. Maxwell knew about Epstein's sexual abuse after 1997 is 
therefore directly relevant to whether she lied at these depositions. 
EFTA00023331
--- PAGE 4 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 64 Filed 10/14/20 Page 4 of 6 
The Honorable Alison J. Nathan 
October 14, 2020 
Page 4 
For example, Count Five alleges that Ms. Maxwell lied in the following exchange: 
Q: Did Jeffrey Epstein have a scheme to recruit underage girls for sexual 
massages? If you know. 
A: I don't know what you're talking about. 
Similarly, Count Six alleges that Ms. Maxwell lied in the following exchange: 
Q: Other than yourself . . . with whom did Mr. Epstein have sexual activities? 
A: I wasn't aware that he was having sexual activities with anyone when I was 
with him other than myself. 
Q: I want to make sure that I'm clear. Is it your testimony that in the 1990s and 
2000s, you were not aware that Ms. Epstein was having sexual activities with 
anyone other than yourself ... ? 
A: That is my testimony, that is correct. 
The government has spoken to numerous individuals who claim to have been assaulted by Epstein 
after 1997, but do not implicate Ms. Maxwell in the assault or claim that she knew about it in any 
way. That bolsters Ms. Maxwell's defense that she was not aware of either Epstein's scheme to 
recruit and sexually abuse underage girls, or that Epstein was engaging in sexual activities with 
others, and therefore did not perjure herself in response to those questions. 
Accordingly, the Materials and the prior statements of the witnesses to whom they pertain 
are exculpatory evidence inconsistent with the government's theory of the charges in the 
Indictment and must be disclosed pursuant to the government's Brady obligations. 
2. The Government Has Not Shown Good Cause that Disclosure of the Materials Will 
Interfere with an Ongoing Investigation 
Even if the Court does not find this evidence to be exculpatory, the Materials are "material 
to preparing the defense" and therefore should be disclosed under Rule 16(a)(1)(E). The 
government agrees that the Materials should be produced, but asserts that there is good cause to 
delay the production of the Materials until eight weeks before trial, pursuant to Rule 16(d). (Dkt. 
at 2-3). The government's justification for the delay, however, is entirely inadequate to 
establish good cause. 
The government asserts that disclosing the Materials will prematurely reveal to the defense 
the identities of certain victims of Epstein who are not referenced in the Indictment, as well as 
EFTA00023332
--- PAGE 5 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 64 Filed 10/14/20 Page 5 of 6 
The Honorable Alison J. Nathan 
October 14, 2020 
Page 5 
sensitive information about them. (Id.). The government further asserts that such disclosure will 
"jeopardize the government's ongoing investigation" because it will reveal to the defendant the 
scope of the government's investigation and may deter other alleged victims from coming forward 
to provide evidence. (Id. at 1, 3). Essentially, the government is arguing that disclosure of the 
Materials should be delayed because it would rather not let Ms. Maxwell know, at this stage of the 
proceedings, who the government spoke to, and because it is concerned that other people might 
not come forward to provide additional evidence against Ms. Maxwell. 
These are not the sorts of concerns that courts have found may jeopardize an ongoing 
investigation and establish good cause for delaying disclosure. Courts typically allow delayed 
disclosure on these grounds when immediate disclosure may alert other potential targets of the 
investigation that they are being investigated or may identify individuals who are proactively 
cooperating with the government to gather evidence against other potential targets. The cases 
cited in the government's own letter make this clear. See Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d at 531-32 
(disclosure of certain discovery materials might "alert the targets of the investigation and could 
lead to efforts by them to frustrate the ongoing investigations"); United States v. Mennino, 480 F. 
Supp. 1182, 1188 (S.D.N.Y. 1979) (government's ongoing investigation into other potential 
defendants could be disrupted by disclosure of certain discovery materials). Similarly, courts 
often grant protective orders in this context when the government has made a sufficient showing 
that disclosure may lead to witness intimidation or threats to their safety. See United States v. 
Urena, 989 F. Supp. 2d 253, 262-63 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (collecting cases). 
The government has done neither here. The government has not made any showing that 
disclosure would thwart an ongoing investigation into other potential targets, or would jeopardize 
the safety of any potential witnesses. Instead, the government asserts a speculative and self-
serving concern that disclosure of the Materials it might make it more difficult to recruit additional 
witnesses for its existing case against Ms. Maxwell. That is not the type of "clearly defined, 
specific and serious injury" that establishes good cause to delay disclosure under Rule 16(d)(I). 
For the foregoing reasons, the Court should deny the government's requested relief under 
Rule 16(d)(1) and instead order the government to immediately produce the Materials and the 
prior statements of these witnesses to the defense.

I've spoken with

next steps. Is there a time this afternoon when you would be free for a call?

Date: Thu, 05 Mar 2020 19:00:52 +0000 
Hello-
The new data set you gave to me from the FBI has some problems and I was wondering if we can get the FBI to fix some of 
these issues. Here are the problems: 
1. 
The data they sent to us has no way to put any e-mails or attachments together so if we were processing the data 
we have no way to link anything together. 
2. 
The load file has no link to the native file which means that when we load the data to the database we have no 
way to have the native files show up in the database 
3. 
The control numbers in the load file do not match those of the native files. Which means we have two sets of 
numbers and no way to match up anything. 
If we can get the FBI to either send us the data again with these corrections applied that would be great. Please let me 
know if there are any questions. 
Thank you.

Hello MI - I just received this from a reporter. It is an indemnification action filed in USVI by Maxwell. It contains 
statements that are directly contradictory to Maxwell's previous sworn depositions including that Epstein was not 
assisting in any of her legal bills and she didn't receive anything of value from him etc. and it also references 
correspondence that she never produced in that case and lists companies that she was apparently employed by. 
I am still reviewing but I wanted to get it to you quickly. Looks like ABC is doing a story on it.

Dear Counsel: 
Today the Government is producing additional materials, including Jencks Act and 
Giglio material, regarding witnesses who may be called to testify at trial in the above-referenced 
case. Enclosed please find an index detailing the materials included in today's production. 
The Government is also producing today certain materials relating to individuals the 
Government does not currently intend to call as witnesses at trial in the above-referenced case. 
These materials do not contain a comprehensive set of Jencks Act and Giglio materials, as the 
Government does not expect to call these individuals to testify at trial. Instead, these materials 
contain, among other things, certain witness statements. Enclosed please find an index detailing 
these materials. This production should not be taken to indicate that the Government believes it 
has any obligation to provide all of these materials; rather, we make this production as a courtesy. 
Moreover, although the Government presently does not intend to call the individuals listed in the 
enclosed index, we reserve the right to do so and will notify you should the Government determine 
that it intends to call any of these individuals at trial.

by the July 31, 2020 Protective Order in this case. In particular, the materials are designated 
as "confidential" under the Protective Order. The index is itself designated as "confidentia l," 
because it includes information regarding records designated as "confidential" under the 
Protective Order. The Department of Justice directed this office to cease the dissemination of

2021 
In order meet the demand for the high volume of media requests we are already receiving, the following 
guidance is being provided in advance of the trial to ensure efficient communications. Please take careful note. 
PRESS GUIDANCE 
Tuesday, November 23, 2021 
*OFF-THE-RECORD,  AND FOR GUIDANCE ONLY: Several of the government's anticipated witnesses 
will be testifying in this trial using a pseudonym or first name. The Court granted a Government motion 
"attached/ requesting that they be able to do so, because the victim witnesses are expected to describe alleged 
sensitive, explicit and personal events concerning illegal sexual abuse, sexual contact and other acts of 
which they have been victims. I believe most, if not all, news media outlets have a policy against identifying 
sex crime victims without their consent, and urge you to abide by that policy with our witnesses and respect 
their privacy. 
9:30 a.m. — Final pretrial conference U.S. v. Ghislaine Maxwell — the defendant is charged in connection to 
conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein to entice minors to travel to engage in criminal sexual activity — before Judge 
Alison Nathan (Courtroom 318, 40 Foley Square [overflow Courtrooms 110, 506, 905, and 906 of the 
Thurgood Marshall U.S. Courthouse]).

----------------------------------------
LB1TMAX1 
precluding the term "victim" is both unnecessary and 
impractical. United States v. Dupigny, 18 CR 528, transcript 
of October 17, 2019, Docket No. 198 at 50. It is appropriate 
for the government to use the terms as representative of its 
litigating position. If the government does this in any way 
that is atypical or unduly prejudicial, I will revisit. 
Defense only cites out-of-circuit or state court 
decisions for the proposition that those terms are inherently 
prejudicial and harm the presumption of innocence. Numerous 
courts of appeal disagree with that argument, particularly when 
the presentation of evidence and the court's instructions 
"taken as a whole clarify the government's burden of proving 
all elements of the crime." United States v. Washburn, 444 
F.3d, 1007, 1113 (8th Cir. 2006); see also, Server v. Mizell, 
902 F.2d 611, 615, (7th Cir. 1990); United States v. Granbois, 
119 F.App'x 35, 38-39 (9th Cir. 2004). 
Defendant's lone district court opinion does not tip 
the balance of this authority. I will, of course, instruct the 
jury repeatedly that the defendant is presumed innocent and 
that it is the government's burden and the government's burden 
alone to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Those 
instructions will eliminate any potential prejudice. See again 
Judge Furman's decision in Dupigny, Docket No. 198 at 49 
That matter resolved, I will turn to the government's 
first motion. This goes to pseudonyms. The government moves 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
(212) 805-0300 
EFTA00023369
--- PAGE 2 ---
LB1TMAX1 
pursuant to the Crime Victims Rights Act, 18 USC Section 3771, 
to permit certain witnesses and certain non-testifying 
witnesses to be referred to by pseudonyms. And there is also 
the issue of redacting related exhibits that contain the names 
or specifically identifying information. Specifically, the 
government requests that eight individuals be referred to by 
pseudonyms or their first name. 
The defense is already aware of the identities of all 
of these individuals, and as the government proposes it, the 
jury will also be aware of the individuals' real identities. 
The request only implicates how those individuals are referred 
to in open court. 
This is well-tread territory, and I will grant the 
request for the following reasons: 
The burden to justify this type of request, of course, 
starts with the government. It "must provide a reason for the 
limitation." United States v. Marcus, which is 2007 WL 330388 
at *1, an Eastern District decision citing United States v. 
Marti, 421 F.2d 1283 (2d Cir. 1970). 
I agree with the government that limiting disclosure 
here would protect the alleged victims from potential 
harassment from the media and others, undue embarrassment and 
other adverse consequences. The Court has an obligation under 
the Crime Victims Rights Act to take certain measures at trial 
to protect the dignity and privacy of alleged victims. 18 USC 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
(212) 805-0300 
EFTA00023370
--- PAGE 3 ---
LB1TMAX1 
Section 3771(a)(8). 
It is quite common for alleged victims, both in cases 
that have garnered media attention and those involving 
allegations of sex abuse, to testify or be referred to by 
pseudonyms or first names. Courts have allowed this whether or 
not the alleged victims are minors or adults or adults 
testifying about abuse that allegedly occurred when they were 
minors. 
Let me give a bit of a string cite here. See, for 
example, United States v. Kelly, No. 19 CR 286, which is a high 
publicity trial involving adults testifying about sex abuse as 
minors, and that's in the Eastern District of New York; United 
States v. Raniere, No. 18 CR 204, a high-publicity trial 
involving at least one adult testifying about sex abuse as 
minor; United States v. Dupigny, No. 18 CR 528, involving sex 
trafficking, United States v. Kelly, No. 7 CR 374, and that 
could be found at 2008 WL 5068820, which is an Eastern District 
case involving an adult testifying about sex abuse as a minor; 
United States v. Graham, No. 14 CR 500, found at 2015 WL 
6161292 (S.D.N.Y., October 2015), that involved adults 
testifying about sex trafficking as minors; United States v. 
Gardner, No. 16 CR 20135, found at 2016 WL 5404207, an Eastern 
District case from 2016 involving adults and adults testifying 
about sex abuse as a minor, and collecting similar cases. 
The practice has been widely permitted because 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
(212) 805-0300 
EFTA00023371
--- PAGE 4 ---
LB1TMAX1 
requiring alleged victims to publicly provide their names could 
chill their willingness to testify for fear of having their 
personal histories publicized. Raniere, Docket No. 622 at 32. 
Given the sensitive and inflammatory nature of the 
conduct alleged, such publicity may cause further harassment or 
embarrassment, and other alleged victims of sex crimes may be 
deterred from coming forward. See, Martinez, 17 CR 281, 
(E.D.N.Y. 2017), Docket No. 34. 
Limiting the disclosure of alleged victims' identities 
in this case furthers these important interests. The same is 
true with the identities of certain witnesses, although not 
alleged victims themselves, because the disclosure of their 
identities would necessarily reveal the identities of the 
alleged victims. 
I'm not persuaded by defense counsel's arguments to 
the contrary. First, the defense notes that Ms. Maxwell does 
not pose a threat to any of the witnesses. That is plainly 
true, and the government does not argue or suggest or allege 
otherwise, but just because that reason for limiting 
disclosures is absent in this case does not eliminate the 
possibility of other justifications. And again, there is a 
need here to prevent undue embarrassment, harassment from the 
press and third parties, and any resistance of others to come 
forward and report alleged abuse. Cases establish that this is 
sufficient 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
(212) 805-0300 
EFTA00023372
--- PAGE 5 ---
LB1TMAX1 
Moreover, any potential prejudice in this regard can 
be cured with an appropriate instruction explaining that the 
reason for the precaution is regard for the witnesses' and 
alleged victims' privacy, and that no inference can or should 
be drawn against the defendant because of these precautions 
My colleagues in this district and elsewhere have used 
such an instruction in similar cases. The defense's concern 
that this sort of instruction affords "Court-sanctioned 
sympathy and credibility" is unfounded. My instructions on the 
law will clearly and repeatedly instruct the jury on the 
presumption of innocence and their sole role in assessing 
witness credibility 
Nor am I persuaded by the defense's arguments that the 
fact that some alleged victims have previously publicly 
disclosed some of their allegations obviates the need to limit 
disclosure. As another district court has held, "just because 
some victims' names are publicly available does not mean that 
the details of their experience are already available." 
Raniere, Docket No. 662 at 34, n. 17 
As I acknowledged in my protective order for this 
case, "Not all accusations and public statements are equal. 
Deciding to participate in or contribute to a criminal 
investigation or prosecution is a far different matter than 
simply making a public statement relating to Ms. Maxwell or 
Jeffrey Epstein." Docket No. 37 in this case at 2. 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
(212) 805-0300 
EFTA00023373
--- PAGE 6 ---
IC 
LB1TMAX1 
The government anticipates that the alleged victims 
will "testify in explicit detail and/or be the subject of 
highly sensitive and personal testimony concerning illegal 
sexual abuse. Thus, there's good reasons to limit public 
disclosure of their names and specifically identifying 
information during trial in this highly publicized case 
involving highly sensitive issues." 
Since there is a valid reason to limit disclosure in 
this case, the defense must proffer a particularized need for 
the disclosure of the relevant information, which is weighed 
against the risks to the witnesses. I'll cite here, for 
example, United States v. Marcus, again citing the Second 
Circuit case in United States v. Marti. 
As both parties acknowledge, the government's request 
potentially implicates the defendant's right under the Sixth 
Amendment's confrontation clause which guarantees defendants 
the right to cross-examine adverse witnesses. The Second 
Circuit has identified two central interests defendants have in 
the public airing of identifying information about witnesses. 
Again referencing the Marti case, 421 F.2d 1263. 
The first is not relevant here because, as I have 
noted, the defense is aware of the alleged victims' and 
witnesses' identities. 
The defendant argues that the second interest, 
however, is implicated. Namely, defense may need the witness 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
(212) 805-0300 
EFTA00023374
--- PAGE 7 ---
LB1TMAX1 
to reveal identifying information because knowledge of that 
information by the jury might be important to its deliberations 
as to the witness's credibility or knowledgability. That's 
quoting the Marti case again. In particular, the defense 
argues that revealing the alleged victims' and witnesses' 
identities is necessary to probe the nature of the alleged 
victims' occupations as relevant to the credibility and elicit 
certain impeachment evidence. 
I agree that such cross-examination cannot be unduly 
limited and the government concedes the same. The government's 
motions in limine 15, n. 6; government reply at 17 to 18. And 
I will ensure that it is not. 
My decision today grants the government's request to 
limit the public disclosure of the alleged victims and some 
witnesses' names and other specifically identifying 
information, such as the specific names of current and past 
employers, names of family members and addresses. 
Limiting disclosure of the specifically identifying 
information does not limit the anticipated cross-examination 
that the defense described in its papers. All lines of inquiry 
the defense outlined in its response are available without 
disclosing specific names of employers or other specifically 
identifying information. For example, the defense can probe 
the genre, nature, and trajectories of witnesses' careers 
without eliciting the specific employer name, but the defense's 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
(212) 805-0300 
EFTA00023375
--- PAGE 8 ---
LB1TMAX1 
cross-examination should not include specifically identifying 
information, and counsel must act responsibly doing so. If, 
after good faith effort in that regard is made and the defense 
at some point feels they have hit a wall and can articulate a 
specific need with respect to a particular line of questioning, 
they can reraise the issue with opposing counsel and with me. 
So that's my ruling on that motion. That said, I do 
strongly encourage the government to speak candidly with the 
anticipated witnesses so that they're clear eyed about what 
this process will entail, the fact that cross-examination will 
not be curtailed beyond the specific identifying information 
that form the basis of the government's request, and the 
possibility that despite these measures their identities may 
become known and revealed to the public. 
Should any of those witnesses or the government choose 
not to proceed by pseudonym, the government shall let defense 
counsel and the Court know. In the meantime, the government 
and defense counsel shall confer about names that will be used 
and any additional process for facilitating the clear 
presentation of evidence. The Court will adopt a clear and 
straightforward approach and the parties are admonished to come 
to agreement on the use of pseudonyms and/or first names. 
First assignment, there will be others, by November 10 
the parties shall submit a joint letter to the Court under seal 
explaining the nomenclature that they propose be employed with 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
(212) 805-0300 
EFTA00023376
--- PAGE 9 ---
LB1TMAX1 
respect to the actual identity of each witness. 
As I mentioned, I do agree with the government that 
limiting instruction explaining the reasons for the precautions 
is appropriate. In light of my ruling, I expect the parties to 
confer and jointly propose such a limiting instruction. 
Homework No. 2. This shall also be filed jointly by 
November 10, and that can be filed on ECF. 
There are some logistics of voir dire related to this. 
Some of my colleagues have used the list method that the 
government proposes on page 15, footnote 5 of their motion, and 
I agree that this proposal makes sense. Once again, the 
parties shall confer and submit on ECF by November 10 a joint 
proposal for any logistical issues related to this for voir 
dire. 
That leaves the issue of sealing unredacted exhibits 
and the limited redacting of exhibits containing specific 
personal identifying information. The government shall manage 
the logistics of this process throughout trial. So think 
through and include in your November 10 submission on ECF the 
specifics of this part of the process so that the trial 
exhibits can be contemporaneously marked with the appropriate 
limited redactions, and the government will need to manage this 
on an ongoing basis throughout trial. 
Government's motion 2, the alleged victims' prior 
consistent statements. So this goes to the admissibility of 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

letter regarding protections for witness identities at trial. In particular, the Court directed the 
parties to: ( I) provide nomenclature for witnesses whose identities should be protected, (2) propose 
procedures for voir dire related to witness identities, (3) submit a proposed instruction to the jury 
regarding witnesses testifying under pseudonyms or under their first name only, and (4) address 
the logistics of offering sealed or redacted exhibits containing personal identifying information. 
Below are the positions of the parties regarding these logistical considerations. Because this letter 
contains identifying information relating to victims, the Government respectfully requests that the 
Court accept the Government's proposed redactions to this letter. 
Government position: 
I. 
Nomenclature 
With respect to nomenclature for witnesses whose identities should be protected at trial, 
the Government respectfully submits the following chart, which provides the true names of 
witnesses and the proposed nomenclature for those witnesses at trial. 
EFTA00023378
--- PAGE 2 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 432 Filed 11/10/21 Page 2 of S 
Page 2 
The Government submits that this nomenclature can be used when trial begins on 
November 29, 2021, but that the parties should be directed to continue referencing victims and 
witnesses on the public record according to the nomenclature in the Superseding Indictment. The 
Government further requests that the defense be directed to redact the true names of the witnesses 
in this chart from all exhibits to filings, and to avoid using the true names of victims in filings with 
the Court. Using the true names of victims delays public filings and creates otherwise unnecessary 
redaction projects that waste the Government and the Court's time. Moreover, using victim names 
in filings increases the risk that victim identities may become public, due to redaction errors or 
other issues. 
II. 
Voir Dire 
Regarding voir dire, the Government proposes that prospective jurors be handed a sheet 
with a list of names and places that may come up at trial. That sheet, which would be filed under 
seal, would contain the true names of witnesses. The sheet would not be read aloud; instead, the 
EFTA00023379
--- PAGE 3 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 432 Filed 11/12/21 Page 3 of 
Page 3 
Government requests that the Court direct prospective jurors to read the sheet and to raise a hand 
if they are familiar with the witnesses or locations. Examination of jurors on this subject would 
then be conducted at sidebar, with the transcript redacted to remove witness identifying 
information. 
III. 
Limiting Instruction 
The Government requests that the Court give the jury an instruction that is similar to the 
instruction Judge Garaufis gave the jury in United States v. Raniere, 18 Cr. 204 (E.D.N.Y.). In 
that case, Judge Garaufis instructed the jury: 
You may have noticed during yesterday's testimony that the witness used first 
names of certain individuals. That is because the names of certain alleged victims 
are being withheld from the public and the press to protect the privacy of those 
individuals. I have therefore instructed the parties to refer to those individuals by 
their first names only; however, those full names are known to the Government, the 
defendant, and to the Court. 
An excerpt of the relevant transcript is enclosed as Exhibit A. Here, the Government proposes that 
the Court instruct the jury: 
At this trial, certain witnesses will be testifying under their first name only. Other 
witnesses will be testifying under pseudonyms — that is, under different names. 
That is because the names of certain alleged victims and related witnesses are being 
withheld from the public and the press to protect the privacy of those individuals. I 
have therefore instructed the parties to refer to those individuals by their first names 
only, or in some instances, by using a pseudonym. However, the full names of the 
witnesses are known to the Government, the defendant, and to the Court. 
The Government respectfully submits that the proposed instruction addresses any potential 
EFTA00023380
--- PAGE 4 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 432 Filed 11/12/21 Page 4 of S 
Page 4 
prejudice to the defendant, as the instruction makes clear to the jury that the identities of the 
witnesses are being protected from the public and press only, and that the true names of the 
witnesses are known to the Government, the Court, and the defendant. 
IV. 
Sealed and Redacted Exhibits 
The Government anticipates offering certain exhibits entirely under seal or with redactions 
to protect the personal identifying information of witnesses and third parties. With respect to 
logistics, the Government would propose submitting redacted versions of exhibits — along with an 
index noting which of the Government exhibits will be offered under seal — no later than November 
29, 2021. To the extent the defense takes issue with the sealing requests or the proposed redactions, 
the Court may rule on those exhibits on case-by-case basis during the trial. 
The Government has considered how best to publish sealed exhibits to the jury while 
protecting the identities of witnesses and the privacy of third parties. On that score, the 
Government is mindful that exhibits published in electronic format on screens in the courtroom 
may be seen by the public, since the screens at counsel table — and potentially the jury box— are 
visible to the public from certain angles. For this reason, the Government requests permission to 
provide jurors with individual binders containing sealed exhibits. The Government expects that 
jurors will follow the Court's instruction to only view items in the binder when the Court instructs 
jurors to do so.

--- PAGE 5 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 432 Filed 11/10/21 Page 5 of S 
Page 5 
Defense position: 
In light of the Court's ruling on the government's motion in limine, the defense will accept 
the government's proposed nomenclature for the witnesses referenced above. The defense has no 
objection to the procedures proposed by the government for voir dire and for sealing and redacting 
exhibits on the understanding that the defense will have the opportunity to object to particular 
sealing and redaction requests. The defense also proposes the following limiting instruction in 
place of the government's proposed instruction: 
This case has received, and will continue to receive, significant attention in the 
media. To minimize the inconvenience and potential harassment of any witness, the 
Court has permitted witnesses, if they choose, to be referred to by either their first 
name or a pseudonym. However, the full names of the witnesses are known to the 
Government, the defendant, and to the Court, and were shown to you during jury 
selection. This process should not bear in any way on your evaluation of the 
evidence in this case. 
Respectfully submitted,

the aspects of the motion we filed, and I think it's a lot for 
the Court to have to deal with, quite frankly, and I know the 
Court is going to try and do the best it can with the 
situation, but I don't think it's tenable and -- I don't ask 
for mistrials easily, I have probably asked for four in my 
entire career, I don't see a way out of this problem. 
(Pause.) 
THE COURT: All right, I'm going to deny the 
defendant's motion for a mistrial. Any issues caused by a 
witness referring to certain individuals by their first name 
only and by asking the Government if they may use last names 
of certain other individuals can be cured by a jury 
instruction, which I will give. Going forward, the Government 
shall provide the defendant and each witness, including the 
current witness, with a list of the individuals whose identity 
should be protected from the public and the press, that way 
each witness can refer to the list rather than asking the 
Government whether a particular individual's identity is 
protected. 
You don't have a proposed jury instruction. 
MS. PENZA: Not yet, Your Honor. 
THE COURT: I have one. 
To the jurors: You may have noticed during 
yesterday's testimony that the witness used first names of 
certain individuals. That is because the names of certain

alleged victims are being withheld from the public and the 
press to protect the privacy of those individuals. I have 
therefore instructed the parties to refer to those individuals 
by their first names only; however, those full names are known 
to the Government, the defendant, and to the Court. 
You may also have noticed that the witness was 
asking the Government whether she should say the last names of 
certain individuals. Going forward, the witnesses will 
receive a list of the individuals whose last names are to be 
protected to which they may refer while testifying. 
Anything else you want me to put in there? 
MS. PENZA: Not from the Government Your Honor. 
THE COURT: You object? 
MR. AGNIFILO: I do, Judge. 
THE COURT: Your objection is noted. 
Also, I'm going to direct that the parties shall not 
make any speaking objections. If the basis for an objection 
is not apparent, the parties may request a sidebar. 
MR. AGNIFILO: Very good. Thank you, Judge. 
THE COURT: Okay, what else? 
MS. PENZA: Nothing else from the Government, but we 
would just ask for five minutes to make sure that the list is 
correct for the current witness. 
THE COURT: All right, we'll take a five-minute 
break.

BOP is in the loop, but I do not know how far up it has gone for this round. For earlier issues in the case, I think we 
went up to the GC. I can confirm with the FOIA Specialist I've primarily been working with there how far it has gone 
this time. (She is in Central Office, not MCC.) I know she went up with one specific issue recently about the production, 
so I assume folks there no the whole thing is going out.

Per the attached, the Court granted the one-week extension in the Epstein FOIA. So the production is now due next 
Friday, July 2. Please let me know if you foresee any issues with that date. 
Please also let me know if you need anything else from me in terms of the processes we discussed yesterday. We are 
working with BOP to finalize the production, but please let me know if I should take steps beyond that (e.g., letting 
additional people know about the production, etc.).

is in fact Epstein's hyoid bone. To the extent we're redacting the closeup photos from page 13, shouldn't we also 
redact the entire photo on page 12?

Attorney Gloria Allred said she placed an ad on a school bus that circled Buckingham Palace this morning, calling for 
him to talk to the FBI about the Jeffrey Epstein case. 
The bus carried a large picture of the prince accompanied by the message -- "If you see this man please ask him to call 
the FBI to answer their questions." 
Allred just discussed her stunt outside criminal court in Lower Manhattan, where she is attending the Harvey 
Weinstein trial. 
Allred who represents some of Epstein's victims. 
Allred displayed a photo of the bus on her computer and a photo from the Press Association is below

Thanks. Just copying/pasting, here goes: 
I just called your desk, but no answer/full mailboxl Quickly, I'm reaching out because my colleagues are working on a story 
-- following up on this story from the other week — about how UK law enforcement is involved in an investigation into 
Barclays PLC CEO Jes Staley and his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. We understand that the FCA (the UK's financial 
watchdog) and the Bank of England's financial stability organization (the very Britishly-named Prudential Regulation 
Authority) is investigating disclosures made the other week by Barclay's board regarding Epstein and Staley's relationship. 
I believe they have now officially confirmed the investigation. 
I think we will want to include a line in the story about how — I THINK — SDNY's investigation into Epstein's sex-trafficking 
organization is continuing. It's been reported that banks have provided some information to SDNY. My questions are as 
follows: 
1. Is it accurate to say that SDNY continues to investigate Epstein's enterprise? 
2. Is SDNY working with the UK authorities on the Staley matter? 
I think that's basically it. Happy to discuss on the phone. I think they plan to publish a story today or tomorrow first thing.

Attached is a draft Paul Kane Q&A. There are a couple questions that may seem weird — basically, since PCS didn't create 
this record, the questions are aimed at a line of Second Circuit cases holding that "Records maintained but not created by 
a company may be admissible as business records of that company if witnesses testify that the records are integrated into 
[the] company's records and relied upon in its day-to-day operations." United States v. Kuthuru, 665 F. App'x 34, 39 (2d Cir.

One minor wrinkle: the FOIA specialist at BOP has tried to contact Mark Epstein a couple times regarding his

FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT REQUEST 
Dear FOIA Officer: 
Requested records 
"Records" means information of any kind, including writings (handwritten, typed, electronic or otherwise 
produced, reproduced or stored), letters, memoranda, correspondence, notes, applications, completed 
forms, studies, reports, reviews, telephone conversations, faxes, emails, documents, photographs,

minutes of meetings, records of meetings in any form, and any other compilation of data from which 
information can be obtained. All of the foregoing are included in this request if they are in the 
possession of or otherwise under the New York Times requests for Records of the following type in the 
possession, custody, or control of OSHA. 
Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. Section 552 et seq ("FOIA"), I request copies of 
(or access to) documents about Jeffrey Epstein who died at the Metropolitan Correctional Center 
(MCC) on Aug. 10, 2019, specifically (hereafter described as "the records"): 
(1) The signed log in the Special Housing Unit at MCC that shows when prison staff did rounds on July 
and 23, and Aug. 9 and 10. 
(2) All quarter entries (showing which cells he was housed in) for Jeffrey Epstein at MCC. 
(3) The CIM Clearance and Separatee data sheet for Jeffrey Epstein at MCC. 
(4) The chronological disciplinary records for Jeffrey Epstein at MCC. 
(5) The intake screening form for Jeffrey Epstein at MCC. 
(6) The security designation records for Jeffrey Epstein at MCC. 
(7) The inmate profile for Jeffrey Epstein at MCC. 
(8) All incident reports related to Jeffrey Epstein at MCC. 
(9) All medical reports related to Jeffrey Epstein at MCC. 
(10) The signed visitor log for Jeffrey Epstein at MCC. 
(11) Documents showing when MCC staff held meetings regarding Jeffrey Epstein, and who attended. 
(12) All records generated from the meeting at MCC during which it was decided that Jeffrey Epstein 
would be taken off suicide watch. 
(13) The Post-Watch report compiled in order to take Jeffrey Epstein off suicide watch. 
(14) The overtime sign-up sheets for the Special Housing Unit (9 South) at MCC for Aug. 9 and 10, and 
on July 22 and 23. 
(15) Documents showing which staff were augmented at MCC and what positions they worked in on 
Aug. 9 and 10, and on July 22 and 23.

The Bureau of Prisons web-based inmate locator shows that only one Jeffrey Epstein is listed in the 
BOP system, so identifying the correct Jeffrey Epstein should not be a problem for the bureau. 
I am a reporter for The New York Times, an accredited and recognized newsgathering organization. I 
request the Records to inform the public about matters of public concem. 
ONGOING LAW ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS/INVESTIGATIONS 
As to any records located in the investigative files of pending investigations, you may not assert 
Exemption 7(A) without conducting a document-by-document review to determine whether release of 
the records would interfere with ongoing law enforcement proceedings. 
The United States District Court of the District of Columbia recently "remind[ed] the FBI of its obligation 
to conduct record-level reviews at the administrative level before refusing to produce records contained 
in its investigative files." Tipograph v. Dep't of Justice, 83 F. Supp. 2d 234 (D.D.C. Mar. 18, 2015) 
In addition, the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016 added a provision instructing federal agencies to 
withhold records only when their release would work some foreseeable or is prohibited by law, not just 
because they may technically be exempt. 
Even if the records might otherwise be exempt, an agency may withhold them only if their disclosure 
would actually harm the interest protected by the exemption, or if it is prohibited by some other law. 5 
U.S.0 552(a)(8). The agency does need to identify what reasonably foreseeable harm would flow from 
release of the information being withheld, consider partial disclosure of the information, take reasonable 
steps to segregate and release nonexempt information. 
RESPONSE TIME 
FOIA requires that your agency respond to this request within 20 business days. This request is 
segregable, and your agency may not withhold entire records because of one section that you believe 
is exempt from disclosure. Under federal law, if you choose to withhold any such parts of the records 
from disclosure, you must specify in a written response the factual and legal basis for withholding any 
part of the Records.

ESTIMATED DATE OF COMPLETION 
I respectfully request that you provide me with a reasonably estimated date of completion. See 5 U.S.C. 
§ 552(a)(7)(B)(ii). If the estimated date of completion is being significantly delayed because of a portion 
of the request needs to be processed by another agency, please inform me which agency that is and 
whether it has provided you with an estimated date of completion. 
FORMAT OF REQUESTED RECORDS 
I am further requesting that the Records be provided to me on computer files in the same format as 
they are currently maintained at the agency, pursuant to Burka v. Dept. of Health & Human Svcs., 87 
F.3d 508 (D.C. Cir. 1996). As you know, providing documents electronically is cheaper than mailing 
hard copies. 
FEE WAIVER 
I respectfully request that you waive all fees in connection with this request as provided by 5 U.S.C. § 
552(a)(4)(A)(iii). FOIA was designed to provide citizens a broad right to access government records. 
FOIA's basic purpose is to "open agency action to the light of public scrutiny," with a focus on the 
public's "right to be informed about what their government is up to." U.S. Dep't of Justice v. Reporters 
Comm. For Freedom of Press, 489 U.S. 749, 773-74 (1989) (internal quotation and citations omitted). 
In order to provide public access to this information, FOIA's fee waiver provision requires "[d]ocuments 
shall be furnished without any charge or at a [reduced] charge . . . disclosure of the information is in the 
public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or 
activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester." 5 U.S.C. § 
552(a)(4)(A)(iii). 
EXPEDITED PROCESSING 
There is extreme public interest in records concerning the prison stay and death of Jeffrey Epstein, who 
was accused of sexually abusing scores of women and underage girls. Not only has a person died in 
federal custody, but the death has generated multiple conspiracy theories implicating government 
works at the highest levels and taxpayer money. Disclosure of the records request is in the public 
interest because disclosure is likely to contribute significantly to the understanding of the operations or 
activities of the government. In addition, as one of the largest circulation newspapers in the United

the public understand how the federal government works. Disclosure of the records is not primarily in 
the commercial interest of myself or The New York Times but is intended to facilitate reporting on the

FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT REQUEST 
Dear FOIA Officer: 
Requested records 
"Records" means information of any kind, including writings (handwritten, typed, electronic or otherwise 
produced, reproduced or stored), letters, memoranda, correspondence, notes, applications, completed 
forms, studies, reports, reviews, telephone conversations, faxes, emails, documents, photographs, 
EFTA00023424

Page 2 of 4 
minutes of meetings, records of meetings in any form, and any other compilation of data from which 
information can be obtained. All of the foregoing are included in this request if they are in the 
possession of or otherwise under the New York Times requests for Records of the following type in the 
possession, custody, or control of OSHA. 
Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. Section 552 et seq ("FOIA"), I request copies of 
(or access to) documents about Jeffrey Epstein who died at the Metropolitan Correctional Center 
(MCC) on Aug. 10, 2019, specifically (hereafter described as "the records"): 
(1) All video camera footage at MCC pertinent to the Jeffrey Epstein suicide and the first suicide 
attempt. 
(2) All BOP documents pertaining to Jeffrey Epstein's suicide and first suicide attempt. 
(3) All BOP documents, including email correspondence and meeting minutes, pertaining to the 
decision to remove Jeffrey Epstein from suicide watch. 
(4) All BOP special investigation reports mentioning Jeffrey Epstein. 
(5) All BOP correspondence with the U.S. Attorney's Office regarding Jeffrey Epstein. 
The Bureau of Prisons web-based inmate locator shows that only one Jeffrey Epstein is listed in the 
BOP system, so identifying the correct Jeffrey Epstein should not be a problem for the bureau. For this 
request, records generated by BOP employees based in New York, Texas, and in Washington, DC, 
should be searched. 
I am a reporter for The New York Times, an accredited and recognized newsgathering organization. I 
request the Records to inform the public about matters of public concem. 
ONGOING LAW ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS/INVESTIGATIONS 
As to any records located in the investigative files of pending investigations, you may not assert 
Exemption 7(A) without conducting a document-by-document review to determine whether release of 
the records would interfere with ongoing law enforcement proceedings. 
The United States District Court of the District of Columbia recently "remind[ed] the FBI of its obligation 
to conduct record-level reviews at the administrative level before refusing to produce records contained 
in its investigative files." Tipograph v. Dep't of Justice, 83 F. Supp. 2d 234 (D.D.C. Mar. 18, 2015) 
In addition, the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016 added a provision instructing federal agencies to 
withhold records only when their release would work some foreseeable or is prohibited by law, not just 
because they may technically be exempt. 
Even if the records might otherwise be exempt, an agency may withhold them only if their disclosure 
EFTA00023425
--- PAGE 3 ---
Page 3 of 4 
would actually harm the interest protected by the exemption, or if it is prohibited by some other law. 5 
U.S.0 552(a)(8). The agency does need to identify what reasonably foreseeable harm would flow from 
release of the information being withheld, consider partial disclosure of the information, take reasonable 
steps to segregate and release nonexempt information. 
RESPONSE TIME 
FOIA requires that your agency respond to this request within 20 business days. This request is 
segregable, and your agency may not withhold entire records because of one section that you believe 
is exempt from disclosure. Under federal law, if you choose to withhold any such parts of the records 
from disclosure, you must specify in a written response the factual and legal basis for withholding any

Dear Ms. Ivory: 
This is in response to the above referenced Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, 
which we received on August 13, 2019. Specifically, you request various documents 
regarding inmate Jeffrey Epstein. 
After a thorough review of your request, we have determined that any records 
responsive to your request are categorically exempt from disclosure. Accordingly, this 
Office is not required to conduct a search for the requested records. Pursuant to the 
Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552, records are withheld in full from disclosure 
to you under the following exemptions: 
(b)(5) - inter- or intra-agency correspondence which would not be available to a party 
other than a party in litigation with the agency 
(b)(6) - constitutes a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy 
(b)(7)(A) - could reasonably be expected to interfere with law enforcement proceedings 
(b)(7)(C) - constitutes an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy 
(b)(7)(E) - discloses investigative techniques and procedures 
(b)(7)(F) - could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any 
individual 
Please note, exemption (b)(7)(A) is a temporary exemption utilized to protect active and 
on-going law enforcement proceedings. Because of its temporary nature, you may wish 
to consider refiling your request for records in the future. Should you chose to refile your 
request, the status of law enforcement proceedings will be reevaluated and a 
determination made at that time as to the continued applicability of exemption (b)(7)(A).

Request Number: 2020-01336 
Dear Ms. Ivory: 
This is in response to the above referenced Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. 
On 01-02-2020, you submitted a FOIA request to the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP). 
A copy of your request is attached. 
After reviewing your request, the BOP determined the request should be aggregated 
into one request, which is request number 2020-01336. This request was made on 12-
12-2019, which is the date you submitted the earliest request being aggregated. This 
will ensure you are not disadvantaged by our action. 
Department of Justice regulations provide for the aggregation of requests where "a 
component reasonably believes that a requester...is attempting to divide a single 
request into a series of requests for the purpose of avoiding fees...." The regulation 
continues, "Components may presume that multiple requests of this type made within a 
30-day period have been made in order to avoid fees." 28 C.F.R. § 16.10(h) (2015). 
BOP's decision to aggregate is based on the time both requests were filed and the 
interrelation of the records sought in each request. We do not know if any fees will be 
associated with this request and will inform you of any estimated fees prior to us 
searching for or copying any responsive records. 
Regarding your request for expedited treatment, you provided insufficient information to 
support your claim regarding an urgency to inform the public. This Office cannot identify 
a particular urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged federal government 
activity beyond the public's right to know about government activities generally. 
You provided insufficient information to support your claim you are primarily engaged in 
disseminating information that would warrant placing your request before all other 
requests. 
Therefore, your request will be processed in the order in which it was received.

New York, NY 10018 
Dear Ms. Ivory: 
The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) received your Freedom of Information Act/Privacy Act (FOIA/PA) 
request in which you request expedited processing of your request. Your request has been assigned a 
number and forwarded to the processing office noted below. Please make a note of the request number 
and processing office as you will need to include it in any correspondence or inquiry regarding your 
request. A copy of the first page of your request is attached to help you more easily keep track of your 
request. 
FOINPA Request Number: 
2020-01336 
Processing Office: 
CO 
The Department of Justice requires all requests for records be processed on a first-in, first-out basis. The 
four exceptions to this requirement are: 
Circumstances in which the lack of expedited processing 
could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; (ii) 
An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity, if made by a 
person who is primarily engaged in disseminating information; (iii) The loss of substantial due process 
rights; or (iv) A matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible 
questions about the government's integrity that affect public confidence." 28 C.F.R. § 16.5(e). The 
Federal Bureau of Prisons makes the determination regarding the first three exceptions, and the 
Department of Justice's Director of Public Affairs makes the determination when the fourth category is 
relied upon as the basis for requesting expedited treatment. 
You requested expedited processing because there is an extreme public interest in records concerning 
the prison stay and death of Jeffrey Epstein, who was accused of sexually abusing scores of women and 
underage girls. Not only has a person died in federal custody, 
but the death has generated multiple theories implicating government works at the highest levels and 
taxpayer money. Disclosure of the records request is in the public interest because disclosure is likely to 
contribute significantly to the understanding of the operations or activities of the government. In addition, 
as one of the largest circulation newspapers in the United States, The New York Times plays an 
important role in sharing information with the public and helping the public understand how the federal 
govemment works. Disclosure of the records is not primarily in the commercial interest of myself or The 
New York Times but is intended to 
facilitate reporting on the operations of government. 
You provided insufficient information to support your claim regarding an urgency to inform the public. This 
Office cannot identify a particular urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged federal 
govemment activity beyond the public's right to know about government activities generally. 
You provided insufficient information to support your claim you are primarily engaged in disseminating 
information that would warrant placing your request before all other requests. 
Therefore, your request will be processed in the order in which it was received. 
EFTA00023435
--- PAGE 2 ---
The time needed to complete our processing of your request depends on the complexity of our records 
search and the volume and complexity of any records located. Each request is assigned to one of three 
tracks: simple, complex, or expedited. Due to the large number of FOIAIPA requests received by BOP 
and the limited resources available to process such requests, BOP handles each request on a first-in, 
first-out basis in relation to other requests in the same track. Your request was assigned to the complex 
track and placed in chronological order based on the date of receipt. 
We determined unusual circumstances exist as the documents responsive to your request must be 
searched for and collected from a field office, and/or the documents responsive to your request are 
expected to be voluminous and will require significant time to review. Because of these unusual 
circumstances, we are extending the time limit to respond to your request for the ten additional days 
provided by the statute. Processing complex requests may take up to nine months. Pursuant to 28 C.F.R. 
§ 16.5(b) and (c), you may narrow or modify your request in an effort to reduce the processing time.

Hi 
>; 
We have produced all FAA records. Most of the password-locked files were duplicates of the certified files, so we just 
produced the certified ones. Only a few of the remaining password-locked files were not duplicates, so I ended up 
printing, scanning, and stamping them, and including them with that production. So, overall, we are all set, and all the 
records were produced. Thanks for checking in!

Just checking in on this thread. Are there still FAA records that we can't unlock and haven't produced? If so, we should 
just include them in the next production and stamp them whatever way we can.

Hi =, 
It appears that external mail size constraints are preventing me from sending you the files that are password-protected. 
The file names are below: 
• 188TH-Airworthiness 
• 188TH-Registration 
• 550GP-Registration 
• N550GP was N212JE was N415LM registration 
• N550GP was N212JE was N415LM registration 
• N722JE registration 
When attempting to edit the PDFs — which all appear to be registration files — we are prompted to enter passwords. These 
are not the complete set of password-protected documents, but these are the documents that we need to be able to 
print/edit as soon as possible. 
I'm more than happy to answer any questions you may have for me. Thanks very much for any and all help you can 
provide us!

Thank you very much for this information and for the quick turnaround. We really appreciate it. 
Do you happen to know the password on the PDF documents you sent us? We'd like to stamp them for discovery

We're still reviewing your email and these documents, but will certainly be back in touch if we have follow up questions.

2007 Gulfstream GV-SP (G550), serial number 5173 was assigned tail number N415LM in March 2017 and was registered 
to 
Chevron USA Inc., Oakland, CA. Per a bill of sale dated March 29, 2017, Chevron USA Inc sold Gulfstream N415LM to; 
Plan D LLC 
St. Thomas, U.S. Virgins Islands 
The registrant was Lawrence VISOSKI, he signed as Manager 
I believe he is Lawrence Paul VISOSKI Jr. 
he is a pilot 
I don't see EPSTEIN's name on any of the FAA paperwork. 
There is open source reporting that VISOSKI was a pilot for EPSTEIN. 
It looks like Insured Aircraft Title Service in Oklahoma handled the transaction. 
https://insuredaircraft.com/ 
Per the Plan D LLC, statement in support of registering aircraft that was submitted to the FM, Jeffrey E. EPSTEIN was a 
member 
and VISOSKI was the manager. Further, Plan D LLC was established in 2012 in the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
Per a request to the FAA dated August 07, 2017 from VISOSKI, they requested to change the tail number from N415LM to 
N212JE. 
In January 2018 they changed the tail number to N212JE. VISOSKI provided phone number 
and e-mail: 
On August 14, 2019 I was told that N212JE was owned by Jeffrey Epstein and was in a hangar at the Cobb County airport 
(KRYY) in Kennesaw, Georgia. 
EFTA00023439
--- PAGE 4 ---
Flight plans indicated N212JE operated on July 07, 2019 from Paris, France to Teterboro, NJ then on July 11, 2019 it 
operated from 
Teterboro, NJ to Brunswick, GA (KBQK). 
Per a bill of sale dated December 22, 2020, Lawrence VISOSKI on behalf of Plan D LLC "sold" N212JE to Six G Aviation LLC 
who "sold" it the same day 
to N550GP LLC in Ontario, CA. N212JE was registered on February 24, 2021 to N550GP and 
signed as 
manager of Frontier JV LLC, its member. 
in March 2021, they changed the tail number to N550GP and it's still registered as N550GP to N550GP LLC. 
It looks like Insured Aircraft Title Service in Oklahoma handled this transaction also. 
https:Mnsuredaircraft.com/ 
I attached a picture of N212JE.

1969 Boeing 727, serial number 20115, N505LS was sold on January 19, 2001 by Real Estate Exchange Inc., Portland, OR 
to JEGE Inc. 
New York, NY 10022. The signature on the aircraft registration application is 
not legible 
but they listed their title as President. They changed the tail number to N908JE in April 2001. On the 2013 re-registration 
application for N908JE, 
Darren K. INDYKE, Vice President signed as Vice President of JEGE Inc. 
They were the registered owner of N908JE from 2001 until October 05, 2019 when the registration was cancelled. 
The aircraft was on the Part 125 certificate of JEGE Inc. and the CEO was Jeffrey EPSTEIN, 
West Palm Beach, FL 33406 Phone 
N9081E was certificated for passenger operations only (not cargo). 
N908JE has a business configuration with a kitchen and bedroom and has approximately 25 seats in the aircraft and they 
aren't economy seats. 
It was used for private business not charter flights. 
https://www.aircraft.com/aircraft/1237885/n908je-boeing-727-100 
N908JE might be in Brunswick, Georgia (BQK). If you need confirmation of its location please advise. 
I think Insured Aircraft Title Service in Oklahoma handled the transaction.

In 1994, a 1974 Gulfstream G-1159B, serial number 151, N979GA was sold by Gulfstream to 
Hyperion Air Inc., Wilmington, Delaware. 
signed as the Chief Pilot and Jeffrey EPSTEIN signed as 
President. 
The signature of EPSTEIN looks similar to the signature on the NS0SJS that became N909JE documents. 
In May 1994 they changed the tail number to N909JE. In 1999 and 2013 we see Darren K. INDYKE name on documents on 
behalf of 
Hyperion Air Inc. In November 2013 they sold N909JE to Starbridge Landing Inc., Dover, Delaware (

In November 2019 they provide phone numbe 
In May 2020 they sold helicopter N331JE to CMG Aircraft Leasing Inc., Miami, FL (broker), who sold it the same day to QIR

In June 2019, an Aircraft Security Agreement for $2,800,000.00 on N1201E was filed with the FAA reflecting JEGE Inc., 
Powder Springs, GA 30127 
as assignor and 
New Bern, NC 28562 as secured party.

He is Thomas Harrison HUFF 
Ika/Powder Springs, GA 
He's a pilot and has been involved in aviation at the Cobb County airport (RYY), in Kennesaw, GA for many years. 
He is of interest to DEA S/A 
n Atlanta, GA 
The aircraft is still registered to JEGE LLC, St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands. 
I suspect HUFF bought JEGE LLC which included the aircraft.

I have confirmed that the government has incorporated all of the defense's proposed redactions within the government's 
proposed redactions. We do not have any more to add. For the record, we oppose the government redactions that are 
additional to the defense's redactions. 
We will now file the defense's motions and exhibits, as redacted/sealed, and then wait for you to file the government's 
response. It may take a little time to get them all filed, so bear with me. 
Thanks, 
Chris

The redactions are consistent with what the government had proposed before. We do not have any redactions to add to 
these documents. But for the record, we object to all of the government's proposed redactions. 
Please send me the next batch when you have them ready.

All, 
Thanks for the call this afternoon, it was helpful to work through the mechanics of filing redactions this afternoon. As we 
discussed, we're sending you versions of the following documents, with redactions applied: (1) the Government's motion 
in limine, (2) the defendant's opposition, and (3) the Government's reply. 
Please let us know if you would like us to add any redactions to these versions, and we'll get them filed. With respect to 
Exhibits: 
• We are attaching a proposed redacted version of Government exhibit A. 
• Only defense exhibits E and G can be filed publicly without redactions. 
• All other defense exhibits to the defense opposition should be filed under seal.

Not sure if we'll have time to get to this during out meeting later, but the team wanted to talk to you about some of the 
ESI exhibits we've marked as potential trial exhibits. They're attached. These items were found on a forensic image of a 
computer registered to "gmax," and the evidence would show that this is a clone of a computer in the Palm Beach house 
in 2005, which was taken by private investigators working for Epstein. The FBI found the cloned drives in Epstein's NYC 
townhouse in 2019. 
We are considering whether any of these exhibits should be offered at trial under Rule 404(b). If we don't get to this 
during our meeting today, we can find another time to talk.

told me to use the larger, corner room. 
Previous requests to use this more ample corner room have been denied

easily positioned the camera focused on the corner mom. 
I am requesting that future in-person visits be conducted in the

Executors' motion to establish the Epstein Victims' Compensation Program,' voluntary 
independent program designed to compensate and resolve the claims of victims of sexual abuse 
by Jeffrey Epstein (the "Program"). On June 22, 2020, based on an understanding that Plaintiff 
wished to participate in the Program and that participation could result in the resolution of 
Plaintiff's claims, Judge Freeman stayed this case. The case remains stayed. 
On June 26, 2020, Plaintiff submitted' claim to the Program. Before submitting her 
claim, Plaintiff was ensured that compensation offers and information submitted to the Program 
would be confidential. Plaintiff's participation in the Program resulted in her receipt and 
acceptance of an offer of compensation on October 5, 2020. In exchange for the offer of 
compensation, Plaintiff executed' release, releasing the Estate, Mr. Epstein and other related 
entities and individuals, including Ms. Maxwell, from any and all claims (the "General 
Release"). To receive her compensation, Plaintiff must dismiss with prejudice any existing 
lawsuits against the Estate and related entities and individuals -- including this lawsuit. 
To conclude her participation in the Program, Plaintiff now moves for Rule 411)(2) 
dismissal of all claims with prejudice. In connection with her motion, Plaintiff filed the 
Proposed Order, to which the Co-Executors do not object. The Proposed Order states that 
dismissal is "with prejudice," and that each party shall "bear its own attorneys' fees and costs." 
It also states that "Plaintiff shall provide Ms. Maxwell with' copy of the General Release, with 
the compensation amount redacted" and that "[t]he parties shall not dispute the authenticity of 
this copy of the General Release in any future proceedings." In addition, the Proposed Order 
EFTA00023489

Case 1:19-cv-10475-LGS-DCF Document 118 Filed 02/10/21 Page 3 of 6 
includes language that preserves Defendants' rights and legal positions with respect to 
indemnity. 
Ms. Maxwell objects to dismissal pursuant to the Proposed Order on the grounds that she 
will be unduly prejudiced if (1) Plaintiff is not required to provide an unredacted copy of the 
General Release, showing Plaintiff's compensation, and (2) each party is required to bear its own 
attorneys' fees and costs. Ms. Maxwell accordingly requests that the Court impose the following 
conditions on dismissal: (I) Plaintiff must provide 
I
copy of the unredacted General Release and 
(2) Ms. Maxwell is entitled to costs and may seek attorneys' fees in another action and at another 
time. 
II. 
STANDARD 
Rule 411(2) states as relevant here, "Except as provided in Rule 411(1) [which 
describes voluntary dismissals made either before the defendant files' responsive pleading or on 
consent], an action may be dismissed at the plaintiff's request only by court order, on terms that 
the court considers proper." Fed. R. Civ. P. 411(2). I district court may exercise its "sound 
discretion" in deciding' Rule 411(2) motion. Catanzano v. Wing, 277 F.3d 99, 109 (2d Cir. 
2001); accord Stinson v. City Univ. of New York, No. 18 Civ. 5963, 2020 WL 2133368, at *2 
(S.D.N.Y. May 4, 2020). 
Although "[v]oluntary dismissal without prejudice is ... not' matter of right" and is 
subject to substantial scrutiny, Zagano v. Fordham Univ., 900 F.2d 12, 14 (2d Cir. 1990) 
(emphasis added); accord Stone v. Fisher, No. 20 Civ. 1818, 2020 WL 2765107, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.

motion for voluntary dismissal with prejudice is generally subject "to far less 
scrutiny," HOV Servs., Inc. v. ASG Techs. Gip., Inc., No. 18 Civ. 9780, 2021 WL 355670 at *2 
(S.D.N.Y. Feb. 2, 2021) (collecting cases). On' motion for voluntary dismissal with prejudice,

the essential inquiry is "whether the voluntary dismissal `will be unduly prejudicial to the 
defendants." Nix v. Office of Comm'r of Baseball, No. 17 Civ. 1241, 2017 WL 2889503, at *2 
(S.D.N.Y. July 6, 2017) (citing Lan v. Time Warner, Inc., No. 11 Civ. 2870, 2016 WL 6778180, 
at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 18, 2016), report and recommendation adopted, 2016 WL 6779526 
(S.D.N.Y. Nov. 15, 2016)). To avoid undue prejudice, courts have the authority to impose 
conditions of dismissal, so long as plaintiff has an opportunity to withdraw her motion if she 
"feels that the conditions are too burdensome." Paysys 
Inc. v. ATOS IT Sens. Ltd., 901 
F.3d 105, 109 (2d Cir. 2018) (internal citation omitted). 
III. 
DISCUSSION 
Ms. Maxwell will not be unduly prejudiced by dismissal. In this case, all the claims 
against Ms. Maxwell will be dismissed, she did not file any counterclaims and dismissal is with 
prejudice so that the claims cannot be brought against her again. She has not shown any 
prejudice from the dismissal or its consequences. Nevertheless, Ms. Maxwell seeks to impose 
two conditions on dismissal. These conditions are unnecessary to prevent prejudice that would 
otherwise result from the dismissal because she has shown no such prejudice. As explained 
below, the Court rejects one condition, and subject to Plaintiff's consent, would grant the other 
requested condition. 
First, Ms. Maxwell asks that the amount of Plaintiff's compensation from the Estate be 
disclosed to her as' condition of dismissal. She argues that she needs the information (I) "to 
make public" that plaintiff wanted money and not justice and (2) to cross-examine Plaintiff in 
Ms. Maxwell's criminal trial. In effect, she is arguing that dismissal will deprive her of the 
vehicle to obtain information she would use in other settings. This is not the type of prejudice 
the rule was intended to prevent, and she cites no case to suggest that it is. The argument is 
EFTA00023491
--- PAGE 5 ---
Case 1:19-cv-10475-LGS-DCF Document 118 Filed 02/10/21 Page 5 of 6 
flawed because she is entitled to information in this case only to defend against the claims in this 
case. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1) (permitting discovery "relevant to any party's claim or 
defense"). If there are no claims in this case as' result of dismissal, she is not entitled to 
information in this case to defend against them. If she wants information to use in the court of 
public opinion she must get it elsewhere. Similarly, if she wants information to use in her 
defense in the criminal case, then she should try to obtain the information using the procedures 
available in that case. 
Ms. Maxwell asks as' second condition to strike the language in the Proposed Order that 
"each party [is] to bear its own attorneys' fees and costs." Subject to Plaintiff's consent, the 
Court would grant that application, not because the dismissal is otherwise prejudicial to 
Defendant, but because adjudication of fees and costs is unnecessary to dismiss the case. 
Ms. Maxwell states that she is not seeking attorneys' fees from Plaintiff at this time in 
this action but does not wish to be precluded from doing so in, different action. The issue of 
fees, therefore, is not ripe, and the parties can litigate it when and if Ms. Maxwell raises it. 
The issue of costs similarly does not need to be resolved in order to grant dismissal. Ms. 
Maxwell apparently intends to seek costs in this case, but she has not yet done so and the parties 
have not fully briefed the issue. I prevailing party, including one in Ms. Maxwell's position, is 
typically entitled to recover its costs. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d)(1) ("Unless' federal statute, [the 
federal] rules, or' court order provides otherwise, costs -- other than attorney's fees -- should be 
allowed to the prevailing party."); see Carter v. Inc. VIII of Ocean Beach, 759 F.3d 159, 165 (2d 
Cir. 2014) (", voluntary dismissal of an action with prejudice works [I material alteration of the 
legal relationship of the parties], because it constitutes an adjudication on the merits for purposes 
of res judicata 
.") (internal citations and quotation marks omitted); accord K'oyitlots'ina, Ltd. 
EFTA00023492

Case 1:19-cv-10475-LGS-DCF Document 118 Filed 02/10/21 Page 6 of 6 
v. Gottschalk, No. 19 Civ. 11309, 2020 WL 6690640, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 12, 2020) (treating 
defendant as the "prevailing party," after' dismissal with prejudice and awarding costs). 
However, "whether to award costs ultimately lies within the sound discretion of the district 
court." Marx v. Gen. Revenue Corp., 568 U.S. 371, 377 (2013). It remains to be seen whether 
Ms. Maxwell will move to recover her costs and in what amount, whether Plaintiff will oppose 
the application, and if so, whether Plaintiff could overcome the presumption that Ms. Maxwell is 
entitled to her costs. 
Because the issues of attorneys' fees and costs need not be resolved in order to dismiss 
this action, the Court is prepared to enter the Proposed Order, modified by striking the language 
"with each party to bear its own attorneys' fees and costs." Plaintiff shall file' letter no later 
than February 12, 2021, stating whether she consents to this modification or wishes to withdraw 
her motion for voluntary dismissal, in which case the Court will restore this matter to its active 
calendar. See Paysys Intl. Inc., 901 F.3d at 109 (2d Cir. 2018) (holding that the plaintiff may 
accept the court's conditions of dismissal or withdraw its dismissal motion and proceed with the 
case). 
IV. 
CONCLUSION 
Plaintiff shall file' letter no later than February 12, 2021, stating whether she consents to 
the Court's entry of the Proposed Order modified by striking the language "with each party to 
bear its own attorneys' fees and costs," or wishes to withdraw her motion for voluntary 
dismissal. The Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to close the motion at Docket No. 97.

For whatever help, if any, it may be, this is a picture of 
taken at about the time of her abuse by 
Epstein. Her recollection is that two photos of her were taken while she was topless. Obviously, copies of those 
photos would be of critical importance if they were ever recovered.

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 309 Filed 07/01/21 Page 1 of 3 
U.S. Department of Justice 
United States Attorney 
Southern District of New York 
The Silvio J. Motto Building 
One Saint Andrew's Plaza 
New York. New York 10007 
July 1, 2021 
VIA ECF 
The Honorable Alison J. Nathan 
United States District Court 
Southern District of New York 
United States Courthouse 
Foley Square 
New York, New York 10007 
Re: 
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
The Government respectfully submits this letter to bring to the Court's attention an opinion 
piece (the "Op-Ed") published yesterday in the New York Daily News, which was authored by 
David Markus, Esq., who represents the defendant in connection with this case. Mr. Markus's 
statements in the Op-Ed were in violation of Local Rule 23.1, which contains provisions relating 
to extrajudicial public statements by attorneys. Accordingly, for the reasons stated below, the 
Government respectfully requests that the Court order Mr. Markus to comply with Local Rule 
23.1. 
A. Mr. Markus's Statements to the Media 
David Markus represents the defendant in connection with appellate matters in this case. 
In particular, Mr. Markus has handled the defendant's bail appeals in this case, including an 
argument on her behalf in the Second Circuit. As the Court may recall, on April 14, 2021, Mr. 
Markus emailed Chambers requesting permission to bring electronics to the courthouse to attend 
the defendant's arraignment on the superseding indictment. The Court informed Mr. Markus that 
he would need to file a notice of appearance before making such an application to the Court. Mr. 
Markus did not file a notice of appearance, but he attended the arraignment and spoke to members 
of the media thereafter.' 
I See Stephen Rex Brown, Ghislaine Marvell Makes First Court Appearance, N.Y. Daily News (Apr. 23, 2021),

b3aza5eh7bddna7r247px2yb7e-story.html (quoting Mr. Markus, speaking outside the courthouse following the 
defendant's arraignment and identifying him as "her attorney").

Page 2 
Mr. Markus has made multiple statements to the media in the past few months.2 On May 
II, 2021, the Government emailed the defendant's counsel of record in this case and expressed 
concern about Mr. Markus's statements, citing Local Rule 23.1. Defense counsel did not respond. 
Most recently, on June 30, 2021, Mr. Markus authored an Op-Ed in the New York Daily 
News.3 The Op-Ed compared the defendant to Bill Cosby and argued that this case should be 
dismissed in the wake of Mr. Cosby's release from prison. The Op-Ed claims that Jeffrey Epstein's 
non-prosecution agreement is binding in this District, but that "[t]he trial court, just like the trial 
court and intermediate appellate court in Cosby's case, has agreed to let the government out of its 
deal." The Op-Ed further claims that this case is "extremely weak" and asserts that "[a] jury should 
reject those flimsy and stale charges." The Op-Ed also identifies Mr. Markus as "Maxwell's 
appellate counsel." Other news outlets have subsequently issued articles regarding the Op-Ed.4
B. Relief Is Warranted Under Local Rule 23.1 
Local Rule 23.1 generally prohibits extrajudicial statements of opinion that a reasonable 
person would expect to create "a substantial likelihood that such dissemination will interfere with 
a fair trial or otherwise prejudice the due administration of justice." SDNY Local Rule 23.1(a). 
The Rule further provides, in relevant part, that statements of "opinion as to the accused's guilt or 
innocence or as to the merits of the case or the evidence in the case" are among those that 
"presumptively involve a substantial likelihood that their public dissemination will interfere with 
a fair trial or otherwise prejudice the due administration of justice." SDNY Local Rule 23.1(d)(7). 
The Rule applies to all statements made by lawyers "in connection with pending or imminent 
criminal litigation with which they are associated." SDNY Local Rule 23.1(a). Furthermore, the 
Rule provides that the Court "may issue a special order governing such matters as extrajudicial 
statements by parties and witnesses likely to interfere with the rights of the accused to a fair trial 
by an impartial jury ...." SDNY Local Rule 23.1(h). 
Mr. Markus is plainly governed by Local Rule 23.1, because he is not only "associated" 
with this criminal case, but he is also counsel of record in the defendant's appeals in connection 
with this matter. Mr. Markus's comments to the media—most egregiously, the Op-Ed—were 
clearly in violation of Local Rule 23.1. Not only did his statements directly comment on the merits

in this case: the Op-Ed was published in a local newspaper, and it contained an express overture 
to jurors, discussing the verdict defense counsel wishes jurors to reach in this case. What is more, 
the Op-Ed falsely suggested to potential jurors that this prosecution is barred by a non-prosecution 
agreement—a legal contention this Court has considered and squarely rejected. 
This Court has already entered an Order—at the request of the defendant—indicating the 
Court's expectation that "all involved parties will exercise great care to ensure compliance with 
this Court's local rules, including Local Criminal Rule 23.1." (Dkt. No. 28). Mr. Markus's 
continued comments are in violation of that Order, are inappropriate, and are likely to interfere 
with the Court's ability to conduct a fair trial with an impartial jury in this case. Accordingly, the 
Government respectfully requests that the Court issue an order pursuant to Local Rule 23.1(h) 
directed specifically to Mr. Markus and instructing him to comply with Local Rule 23.1.

The email exchange below confirms our inability to locate the first volume of 
deposition. However, attached are 
fairly detailed notes of Paralegal/Investigator Mike Danchuk, who attended the deposition and recorded these notes 
contemporaneously. 
appears to have held nothing back, and the notes certainly paint a picture of the kind of 
troubled young women who were particularly susceptible to Epstein's pattern of recruitment, grooming and 
victimization.

As a follow up to our conversation, I have attached a copy of my subpoena tracker. The tracker only includes 
subpoenas that were served by the FBI. M an example, the Epstein Deutsche Bank production is not included 
in this list. 
If you are missing any productions, please have

You mentioned that is it is possible to set up a Dal virtual drive that we can share. That sounds great.

Robert, 
follow-up 
Wanted to quickly follow up on our conversation from a couple weeks ago — obviously it was before the world 
imploded, so understand if you haven't gotten a chance to connect on this yet, but we were wondering about the 
Lion King question? Just to briefly remind, the Lion King musical first came out in 1997, which we think would have 
been well after 
first trip to New York (based on her recollection as well as the flight records), while the 
movie came out in 1994 and was in theaters through approximately spring 1995. So entirely possible she was 
referencing the movie version, or that going to the play wasn't the first visit, or just doesn't have a specific 
memory, etc etc, but wanted to check for our records and our decision-making process. 
Thank youl And hope you and your family are healthy and safe in the midst of everything going on. 
thanks again,

Hi 
I hope you are doing well. We spoke about a year ago regarding the Jeffrey Epstein case, and I am reaching back out now 
to request assistance in the discovery process for my office's related prosecution of Ghislaine Maxwell. Would your office 
be willing to share with us a copy of its files relating to your prior investigation and prosecution of Epstein? 
I'm happy to have a call to discuss further, and please let me know if there is someone else in your office I should speak 
with regarding this request. I can be reached any time on my cellphone at 
Thank you very much for your help. 
Best, 
Assistant United States Attorney 
Southern District of New York

i n discussing your relationship with a 
. You used the phrase in your testimony 
earlier, you used the phrase "eat out." Could you 
describe what that phrase means in the context that 
you were using it? 
MR. SCAROLA: We will stipulate that what 
it means is cunnilingus. 
BY MR. LUTTIER: 
Q. Okay. Do you know what a sex toy is? 
MR. SCAROLA: Could you explain what 
relevance or materiality your understanding of 
that line --
MR. LUTTIER: Sure. It was --
MR. SCAROLA: -- of questioning might have 
since there is no allegation that sex toys were 
ever employed in encounters between 
and 
Mr. Epstein? 
MR. LUTTIER: Well, I dispute that for 
sure. I just tell you if you read the record 
carefully, you will find out that is not at all 
0170 
true, and that's why it is relevant. Come up 
many a time. 
MR. SCAROLA: In connection with 
allegations from 
? 
MR. LUTTIER: There and in the IME. 
MR. SCAROLA: Okay. Well, if you 
represent, if you represent that that's the 
case, then proceed. 
BY MR. LUTTIER: 
Q. Do you know what a sex toy is? 
A. Yes. 
Q. Okay. And what is your understanding of 
that term so that we are understanding each other 
when I ask you these questions? 
A. I guess toys used doing sexual things. 
Q. Okay. And that would include, for 
example, vibrators? 
A. Yes. 
Q. Dildos? 
A. Yes. 
Q. Have you used sex toys in the past? 
A. No. 
Q. Never? 
A. Never. 
Q. Either -- how about with 
? 
0171 
A. No. 
Q. Did you ever tell anybody you had? 
A. No. 
Q. Did you, did you ever use any sex toy with 
Jeffrey Epstein? 
A. He tried to use a massage thing and I told him 
no.

Q. What did you mean by "massage thing"? 
A. Whatever it was in the hell that he had. 
Q. Well, what -- describe what you are 
talking about. 
A. I just told you. 
Q. Well, massage thing doesn't tell me 
anything. What are you talking about? 
A. I don't know what it was called. I don't know 
what it is. 
Q. What did it look like? 
A. It looked -- it was -- I don't know. It 
vibrated. It looked like it was a neck massager. 
Q. But do you know, do you know -- can you 
describe, physically describe how big it was, what 
color it was, what it looked like? Can you describe 
anything about it? 
A. It was gray and do you want me to draw you a 
picture because I don't know how to describe what it 
0172 
looked like. 
Q. How large was it? 
A. It was like this big (indicating). 
Q. Okay. 
A. It was like a neck massager. 
Q. You know like -- you know what Brookstone 
is, a store? 
A. Yeah. 
Q. Have you ever been in there and they have 
these massages that, like you can reach behind your 
back and stuff like that. Are we talking about 
something you know, like that? 
A. Yeah, but it didn't have a wire, an electrical 
wire. 
Q. Okay. 
A. It was like battery operated. 
Q. And you say that Mr. Epstein tried to use 
this on you and you said no? 
A. Yeah. 
Q. And then he --
A. That was the end of that. 
Q. -- didn't use it? 
A. He did not, and he's never, it never was 
brought up again. 
Q. Have you ever desired to use any kind of 
0173 
sex toy? 
A. No. 
Q. And, and then not done it for some reason? 
A. No. 
Q. Okay. Back to 
. How many 
sexual encounters would you estimate you had with 
A. I don't know. 
Q. What's your best estimate with what degree

of frequency did you and she have a sexual 
relationship? 
MR. SCAROLA: Those are two different 
questions, compound. 
THE WITNESS: What does this --
MR. LUTTIER: With what --
THE WITNESS: What does this have to do 
with me and Mr. Epstein? 
BY MR. LUTTIER: 
grWith 
what degree of frequency did you and 
have sexual relations? 
MR. SCAROLA: That's the second part of 
the question that you asked. 
MR. LUTTIER: That's the question. I will 
break it up then. 
0174 
BY MR. LUTTIER: 
. You've testified earlier that you and ■ 
had sexual relations? 
MR. SCAROLA: We'll stipulate that that 
occurred on multiple occasions. 
BY MR. LUTTIER: 
Q. All right. Tell me with what degree --
MR. SCAROLA: And beyond that an inquiry 
is intended for no other purpose except to 
annoy, harass, and embarrass. 
I 1 
MR. LUTTIER: With all due respect, I 
disagree. So, I am going to ask my question. 
MR. SCAROLA: And I disagree with your 
disagreement. And I will instruct her not to 
answer. 
MR. LUTTIER: Okay. Let me get the 
question out. 
BY MR. LUTTIER: 
Q. On how many occasions did you and 
have sexual relations? 
MR. SCAROLA: And the stipulation is that 
it occurred on multiple occasions and beyond 
that no relevant inquiry can be made. 
BY MR. LUTTIER: 
Q. And when, when your lawyer stipulates that 
0175 
it's multiple occasions, if you had a relationship 
with her for 12 months, can you estimate how many 
times it was? 
A. I refuse --
MR. SCAROLA: Don't answer that question. 
THE WITNESS: -- to answer. 
MR. LUTTIER: And you refuse to answer --
MR. SCAROLA: Because her lawyer has 
instructed her not to answer because the 
question is obviously intended, after the 
stipulation, for no other purpose except to

annoy, embarrass, and harass the witness. 
MR. LUTTIER: It's, it's not intended to 
be annoying. I believe the degree of frequency 
is absolutely relevant in the case. 
MR. SCAROLA: To what -- to which element? 
MR. LUTTIER: Arguable -- well --
MR. SCAROLA: To which element? 
MR. LUTTIER: I don't want to --
MR. SCAROLA: To which element of the 
offense? 
MR. LUTTIER: I am not going to argue my 
case to you, but it absolutely has an effect on 
the alleged claim of damages. Beyond that I 
don't need to tell you the theory of my case 
0176 
but --
MR. SCAROLA: I disagree. 
MR. LUTTIER: Okay. 
BY MR. LUTTIER: 
Q. Do you, do ou -- how did your 
relationship with 
end? 
A. I met m son's father. 
Q. Who is 
A. Yeah. 
Q. Did your relationship wit

were going to go your separate ways --

A. We agreed wegsddo separate ways.

portion of her name tattooed on your body? 
A. Yes, I did. 
Q. And what did you have tattooed on your 
body? 
A. M. 
Q. And when did you have that done? 
A. While we were -- when I turned 18. 
0177 
Q. So, it would have been about six years, 
five years after your relationship ended? 
A. Yeah. 
Q. And why did you have her name tattooed on 
your body five years after you ended your 
relationship with her?

A. When I was with 
What does 
have to do with Mr. Epstein? This is why I am here, 
because of Mr. Epstein. 
Q. So, if I understand your testimony

0184

counselors and advisers about it?

A. I don't know who iri
dme. 
Q. Well, did you tell 
in your 
meeting with him that you called the police after 
the rape and had the individual arrested? 
A. No, I did not. So if he wrote that, then he 
0185 
lied. 
Q. Okay. Well, fortunately it is videotaped. 
MR. SCAROLA: Fortunately it is, because 
ot

BY MR. LUTTIER: 
Q. Okay. Did, did you bring a lawsuit 
against anyone as a result of your rape? 
A. No. How can you sue somebody for raping you 
if you don't know who did it? 
Q. Well, presumably at some point you went to 
the beach with this male, correct? 
A. Yeah. 
Q. You got there under your own power; that 
is you walked out there? 
A. Yes, but I don't remember the person's name. 
Q. And when you walked down there with this 
person, you knew who that person was at that time?

yours as well, did you not?

of this person --
A. Yes. 
0187 
Q. 
A. Yes. 
Q. And she had somebody with her? 
A. Yes. They were her friend. 
Q. So, you had a girlfriend who knew the name 
Q. -- that went with you? 
A. But I don't know where that friend is now. 
Q. And the day or the time that you woke up 
after this rape, the girlfriend that you went to the 
beach with was there? 
A. Yes. 
Q. And presumably you could have asked her 
what the name of this boy was? 
A. Well, I was scared. 
Q. Did you ask her what the name of the boy 
was? 
A. 
Q. 
A. 
Q. 
A. 
Q. You represented earlier, I believe, that 
you were in some type of car accident? 
A. Yes. 
Q. How many car accidents have you been in? 
A. One. 
Q. And in what year was that? 
A. '08. 
No, I didn't. I was scared. I was confused. 
Did she call the police? 
I don't know what she did. 
But in your presence at no time --
She did not. 
And did, did you bring a claim against 
anyone as a result of any injury you suffered in 
that accident? 
A. I think my, I think my mom, we did, yeah. 
Q. Well, if you did it in '08, it would have 
been when you were an adult. You were already 18 
years of age? 
A. Yeah, I had just had my daughter. 
Q. Okay. Then if, if you were an adult, you 
would have been the one to bring the claim? 
A. Well, my mom did it. We were at a dead stop 
and somebody hit us and then we were hit again. 
Q. Okay. Did you, did, did you and your mom 
assert a claim against an insurance company or the 
person that hit you? 
A. Yeah. 
Q. Did that result in getting some kind of 
settlement? 
A. I don't know. 
Q. Did --
A. I think my case is still pending with it. 
Q. Did you, did you have a lawyer

my age, I told him that I would not bring my friend if, 
if that situation was to occur with her because I didn't 
like it. I felt uncomfortable, and I would not subject

be totally nude?

some of her clothes. I didn't specifically say you're 
going to have to get naked.

that you first took M. there, you had been totally 
nude for months while performing massages for 
0214 
Mr. Epstein, correct? 
A. So. 
Q. Correct? 
A. Yes.

A. We left, we left --
Q. You mean January of '03? 
A. No, if you would let me finish. We left the 
State of Florida because we had a bad cocaine habit by 
that point. With all the money that I received from 
Mr. Epstein I could afford it. So, we had made a 
decision to leave the State of Florida and I had been 
clean for about a month and we couldn't handle it. So 
we decided to leave the State of Florida so we wouldn't 
have to worry about it anymore. 
Q. So, if you left in June of '03 that means 
your last use of cocaine would have been in May of 
0219 
'03?

of '03 when you, approximately when you moved to 
Georgia through February of '04?

was losing my mind.

A. I don't know right now. 
Q. Do you know of any way you suffered any 
damage? 
A. What? 
MR. SCAROLA: Well, you have already heard 
repeatedly --
MR. LUTTIER: No speaking -- Other than 
what you have told me in this deposition. 
MR. SCAROLA: That's fine. 
BY MR. LUTTIER: 
Q. Okay. Is that it? 
A. Yeah, that's it. 
0232 
Q. Okay. Now, what do you mean when you say 
you have trust issues. 
A. Exactly what I said. 
Q. Well, I don't understand that. Explain 
that. Explain that to me. What do you mean you 
have trust issues? 
A. I have trust issues with people. 
Q. Meaning what, you can't trust people? 
A. No, I can't. 
Q. Anybody? 
A. Guys particularly. 
Q. Males? 
A. Males, older males. 
Q. Any males, older males? 
A. Yes. 
Q. What age male does it have to be for you 
not to be able trust them? 
A. Older than myself. 
Q. So, any man that is older than you, you 
don't feel like you can trust him? 
A. No. 
Q. How has that impacted you in your daily 
life? 
A. Well, I go outside and there is men 
everywhere. 
0233 
Q. Okay. So, what effect does that have on 
you? You can't trust the people --
A. Exactly --
Q. -- according to you? 
A. -- it. I can't trust nobody. 
Q. So, you're not asking them to do anything 
or do anything for you, are you? 
A. No, because I don't want them to. 
Q. Okay. So, help me understand how has this 
impacted you at all that you claim you can't trust 
men that are older than you? 
A. Because I can't trust them. What else do you 
want me to say? 
Q. Well, I want you to describe how --
A. I can't --

--- PAGE 34 ---
Q. How your damage -- what is it that you 
want these men to do --
A. Nothing, I don't want them to do anything. 
Q. -- that -- wait a minute. 
A. I want them all to leave me alone. 
Q. What is it that you want these men to do 
that you can't trust them to do? 
A. There is nothing that I don't want, that I 
want them to do. 
Q. Have you ever asked a man older than you 
0234 
to do something? 
A. Other than my attorneys, no. 
Q. All right. 
A. No offense to you guys. 
Q. So, there has never been an occasion since 
you last went to Mr. Epstein where you asked a man 
that was older than you to do something and you 
counted on trusting them? 
A. I counted -- well, my attorneys, but that's 
it. 
Q. Okay. But there has never been a time 
that you've placed your trust --
A. I refuse --
Q. Wait a minute. 
A. No, I don't let them, allow them. 
Q. Now, so, you haven't even attempted to, 
quote, to use your words, trust a man that's older 
than you since you last saw Mr. Epstein; is that 
correct? 
A. Yes. That's correct. 
Q. Now, when you say trust, do you mean you 
don't want to be in their physical presence? 
A. I don't, no, I don't want to be in their 
physical presence. 
Q. But in fact as you testified earlier, you 
0235 
worked for at least two escort services where you 
have gone out and been paid to be in the presence of 
men older than you, correct? 
A. Correct. 
Q. Didn't feel like you were in any kind of 
danger, right? 
A. No, sometimes I did. And I already told you 
those times. 
Q. Well, you wouldn't have gone if you 
thought you were in any danger, would you? 
A. Exactly. 
Q. Okay. So there were many occasions that 
the driver came and got you, and you were going out 
with somebody at the escort services where they were 
older than you and you had no fear of anything; 
isn't that right? 
A. Yes.

Q. By the way, when you worked for these 
escort services, would they call you up and tell you 
on such-and-such a day there is somebody that wants 
to go out with you? Is that how it was done? 
A. Yes. 
Q. What would they tell you about the person 
that wanted to go out with you, if anything? 
A. They would tell me where, what the occasion 
0236 
was, what I would be doing, what kind of wear I would 
have to wear, formal, outside, the type of dress I 
needed to wear. 
Q. Did they -- well, what specifically did 
they tell you about what you had to wear? Did they 
tell you, describe what kind of clothes or just--
A. I just said formal. 
Q. But did they say, for example, wear 
something that's low cut or don't wear a bra or, you 
know, wear this or wear that? 
A. No. 
Q. Or this is just a formal or this is a 
semi-formal occasion? 
A. It's a formal or semi-formal for the fourth 
time now I am telling you. So I am done answering 
questions about that. 
Q. What else did they tell you other than 
what to wear? 
A. Nothing. 
Q. Did they tell you anything at all about 
the person with whom you would be going out? 
A. Sometimes. 
Q. And with what degree of frequency would 
they tell you about the person that you were going 
out with? Did they always do that?

A. Sometimes. I just said sometimes. 
Q. More than half the time? 
A. Sometimes. If it was --
Q. More than half --
A. -- more than half the time, I would have said 
more than half the time, but it's sometimes. 
Q. So that was --
A. Sometimes yes and sometimes no, sometimes. 
Q. Would you estimate that it was less than 
half the time? 
A. I'm not answering that question seriously 
because I have said sometimes. 
Q. Describe sometimes to me by percentage. 
A. I don't know the percentage of sometimes. 
Sometimes. 
Q. Well, let's -- we all know what 50 percent

Q. Don't let me put words in your mouth, 
ma'am. You were there, not me. 
A. I said sometimes. 
Q. If you could just tell me if it was more 
or less than 50 percent of the time? 
MR. SCAROLA: And you have been told 
0238 
repeatedly that she is unable to do that for 
you. 
BY MR. LUTTIER: 
Q. So, how can you quantify for me by 
definition your phrase sometimes? 
MR. SCAROLA: And the answer to that 
question is she's been unable to. So we're 
sorry that we can't give you more specific 
information. But "sometimes" obviously means 
more than once and less than always. 
THE WITNESS: So you figure it out. 
BY MR. LUTTIER: 
Q. Well, now, ma'am, it would be hard for me 
to do that. I wasn't there. So, it could have been 
as much, according to your definition, as 99 percent 
of the time, right? 
MR. SCAROLA: At this point those 
questions are annoying, embarrassing, and 
harassing, and I will instruct the witness not 
to answer. 
BY MR. LUTTIER: 
Q. What else, if anything, were you told 
about the individuals that you were going to be 
going out with when you were working for the escort 
services? 
0239 
A. What does this have to do with the original 
question at hand? 
Q. If you can just answer my question now. 
A. And I already told you what they would tell 
me.

Q. Did you give the escort service any 
criteria about the type of person you would agree to 
go out with? 
A. Yes. 
Q. What criteria did you give them? 
A. I wouldn't go out with black guys because 
0241 
black people are abusive and controlling. And I have, I 
just felt unsafe. And I would only go out with people 
that didn't want sex or anything sexual. 
Q. So you said no black guys and you said no 
one that wants anything, sex or anything that's 
sexual? 
A. Yes. 
Q. Did you have to describe for the escort 
service --
A. No, I didn't. 
Q. -- what you meant by sexual? 
A. Anybody in their right mind what know what 
I 3 
sexual and sexual things are. 
Q. So, you didn't give them any age bracket, 
right?

by the word relinquished. Did you ever givem 
sign away your parental rights to your son, 
A. Yes, I did. 
Q. Would you explain the facts and 
circumstances surrounding you doing that? 
A. I was not financially stable enough to take 
care of him.

over your rights, or they were going to take your 
son? 
A. No. 
Q. What did they tell you about what your 
choices were? 
A. They told me I had to go through classes and 
all kinds of things. But I still, whether I did the 
class or not, I wouldn't have been financially stable 
enough to take care of my son. So, I signed my rights 
over to his aunt who was financially able to take care 
of my child.

your parental rights in that case? 
A. They tried. 
Q. And as a result of that did you 
voluntarily relinquish your rights? 
A. Yes, I did. 
Q. And again did DCF insist that in order for 
you to see your child, you would have to do certain 
things? 
A. Yes.

not doing everything, they were going to take your 
child away?

son and your daughter, DCF had told you --

they're in a gang because I don't know about it. And if

through a lot. Why does anybody take up using drugs 
or --
Q. What boyfriend are you referring to, 
saying Mt 
your boyfriend?

leave and say he didn't want anything to do with 
you?

the kid that you're talking about there, is that 
A. 
Q. Anything else that caused you to use crack 
in January of '05?

felt disgusted by Mr. Epstein.

Mr. Epstein never did with you, hadn't you? 
A. So, what does that have to do with 
Mr. Epstein, my sex life. 
Q. When you talk about being disgusted --
A. Why don't you get naked in front of an old man 
and play with his nipples while he masturbates. You do 
that and then you tell me if you feel good.

Q. Well, according to your complaint the 
first time you meet him was when you were 15? 
A. I don't -- that, I don't know.

A. While I was being prescribed it. 
Q. Did you tell the doctor you had been 
become addicted to it? 
A. Yes, this is why I no longer get a 
prescription for it. 
Q. And what were you getting detoxed from the 
0292 
second time at CARP? 
A. Roxies. 
Q. So you had to be detoxed twice from 
Roxies? 
A. Well, yes, because I detoxed the first time 
and then I went back to using them again because of my 
back pain. 
Q. Did you report to the physician that was 
giving you the prescription that you had been 
detoxed one time before you went back to using? 
A. No. Because if you recall in your notes, I 
saved the prescription to the next year after I had 
stopped going to that doctor. 
Q. So, you continued to take the drug even 
though you had detoxed from the drug? 
A. Yes. 
Q. You knew you were addicted to it in the 
past? 
A. Yes. 
Q. Opted, by your own choice, to do it again? 
A. Yes. So, if that makes me a criminal, then 
sobeit. How much time do we have left? I want to go 
get my son.

0293 
to go get my kid; the kid that I signed my 
rights over to by the way. 
BY MR. LUTTIER: 
Q. What was the last grade you completed in 
school? 
A. Seventh. 
Q. And what school were you attending? 
A. Bear Lakes. Actually, yeah, actually the last 
year I completed was seventh. I started eighth grade 
and they kicked me out of school because I was too 
physically developed. 
Q. What do you mean by that? 
A. My boobs were too big and I got sexually 
harassed by the kids in school. So they called my mom 
and told her she needed to sign me out. And if you 
don't believe me, you take it up with Bear Lakes. 
Q. So, did you enroll in another school? 
A. No. 
Q. Why not? 
A. Because I didn't feel like it at the time. 
Q. And you were, then you were what they call

a truant at that point? 
A. I wasn't truant. At 16 years of age, you 
don't have to go to school anymore. It's legal. 
Q. So, you opted by your own free will to 
0294 
quit going to school at that time? 
A. Yes. I got pregnant and now have a 
six-year-old son. 
Q. You, did you get pregnant before you had 
dropped out of school? 
A. No. I got pregnant after. 
Q. What did you do during the days after you 
dropped out of school? 
A. Watched TV. 
Q. Had you had run-in's with the law prior to 
that? 
A. When I was 18 years old, I did. 
Q. Had you had an incident while you were a 
juvenile where you were arrested for throwing a 
knife at your brother or something? 
A. Yeah, he tried to kill my cat, and then he 
tried to kill me, so I threw a knife at him. 
Q. Had you and your brothers been removed 
from your mom's care on an occasion --
A. Never. 
Q. -- when your mom was arrested? 
A. Never. 
Q. Do you remember being placed with some 
neighbors and the neighbors calling the authorities 
and saying they wanted someone to come pick you-all 
0295 
up? 
A. No. We have never been removed out of my 
mother's care or custody. 
Q. Do you remember you and your brothers 
being present on an occasion when your mother was 
arrested and taken away? 
A. No, I have never watched my mom be arrested. 
Q. Do you remember any occasion where she was 
arrested for possession of drug paraphernalia? 
A. Yes. And if you look the DNA, the court did 
DNA, and my mother's DNA was not on that paraphernalia. 
So that charge was dropped. 
Q. Were you present when these charges were 
made? 
I 5 
A. I was present but I wasn't in the presence of

Re: 
Proposed Redactions to Request to Modify Protective Order (Under Seal) 
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) 
Dear Judge Nathan, 
In accordance with this Court's Order of August 18, 2020 (Doc. 44), Ms. Maxwell hereby 
respectfully submits under seal her proposed redactions to her Request to Modify Protective 
Order ("Request"), filed under seal on August 17, 2020. Ms. Maxwell also has filed her Reply 
under seal and contemporaneously submits her proposed redactions to that pleading.' 
Ms. Maxwell has no opposition to keeping under seal, and redacting from her Request and 
Reply, the contents, description and discussion of the sealed materials themselves; because the 
government has marked them Confidential, the Protective Order requires as much. See Doc. 36, 
15. 
The government's proposed redactions, however, go further and propose to redact significant 
procedural background, all of which is publicly available information. The government would 
have this Court redact the "snectttc civil suit Nom which the eovernment obtained matenals - 
v. Maxwell lit ahon1 
government's investigation." 
on the premise that it would "risk jeopardizing the

case, and to they

Moreover, the government has made repeated, highly public statements, including at the press 
conference following Ms. Maxwell's indictment,' in the press conference following Mr. 
Epstein's indictment,' in a press conference convened at the doorstep of Mr. Epstein's former 
New York mansion,' and in other publicly-released statements' that its investigation into 
associates of Mr. Epstein is ongoing and active. 
undamentally, the sealed materials are judicial documents. "1 'he pleadings and orders do no

judicial document should remain under seal is clear. Once a determination is made that the 
materials are judicial documents the Court is required to determine whether any countervailing 
interests outweigh the presumptive right to public access. M. 
Maxwell, 929 F.3d 41, 49-50 
(2d Cir. 2019). 
Frankly, Ms. Maxwell does not believe that the government has established a countervailing 
interest compelling enough to justify continued sealing of the documents.

However, Ms. Maxwell has no interest in additional pretrial publicity related to any of these

Hey all, 
P; 
Just wanted to send a quick email to detail what is being given today. There is a box of media, including VHS, cassette, 
and microcassettes, and newspaper articles that were provided by Reiter. 
On the thumbdrive is a spreadsheet outlining what is included; items highlighted in blue are included. You will notice a 
comment "see disk tracking spreadsheet" in items not highlighted; this spreadsheet will be included in the disk copies we 
send over that will detail how many images total and how many removed. 
There are loose disks which include 1B evidence scans, 1D1-1D5 evidence items, LSJ 3D imaging, and the FBI file. 
Separately, we will keep you updated as we continue to work on the redactions and will let you know as soon as we finish 
with the disks. 
Let us know you have any questions.

On these: 
• Yes, please send over the copy of the gj transcript disc when you can. 
• Found the original scans from the FL file—thank you! 
• Yes, please get us the paper evidence from NY, VI, and Reiter as soon as you can. 
• We'll take the FBI file whenever you can get it to our office. 
• My understanding from past FBI cases is that CART completes some sort of paperwork documenting the dates on 
which they conduct data extractions. We need that for all of the extractions in this case, please (It may not be 
302s). 
• On the evidence from disks, understood. In order to give you more time, we are going to tell the defense 
attorneys that the materials are available for them to review in-person if they want to schedule a time to come 
down to the FBI office, but that in the meantime we are still working on getting copies of non-nude images to 
produce to them.

Hey all, below is a summary of the discovery items you've requested. 
Message Pad Scans: The message pads were scanned with the post it notes on them and the very next page is the page 
without the post it note, so the pages are back to back. 
Papers from Miami case file (grand jury testimony): This is a disk — I can copy it and send it over to you. 
Evidence scans: Are you referring to the scans from the FL file? We sent those over with the original message pad scans 
last year. If you need that again, let us know and we can get another copy over to you. As far as paper evidence from 
the NY and VI searches, and the paper provided by Reiter, we can get that over to you by the end of the week. 
FBI file: We have that ready for you. 
CART: There are no 302s regarding the extraction of devices. 
Evidence from disks: This is a large volume and we've been working on this and removing nude/semi nude images. This 
is the only thing that would be difficult to complete by Friday. If we could have a little more time to pull this together, 
that would be very helpful. 
If it's helpful to talk through some of this via phone, we are happy to do that as well.

Hi 
and 
The drive you provided us has some scans on it (looks like they're scans of the message pads). As I recall, there was a 
larger scanning project, during which the FBI scanned all of the paper that was vouchered in evidence. Are you able to 
provide us with all of those scans this week? 
With respect to the message pads in particular, I think you mentioned that they were scanned both with post-it notes on 
them and also without the post-it notes. The version on this drive just looks like it has the post-it note scans.

Hi

(NY) (FBI) •,:
> 
Thanks so much for your help with the Maxwell discovery so far. I have some follow-up questions about the most recent 
batch you provided, and wanted to check in on the longer term tasks we discussed last month. 
Below are some questions regarding the discovery 
dropped off a few days ago with requests for additional items: 
• 
The last page of the attached appears to be a photograph of a disc. The label on the disc seems to suggest it 
contains grand jury transcripts. Have you given us those transcripts? 
• 
The message pad scans you provided still have post-it notes on top of several of the message pad pages. I think 
mentioned that each pad had been scanned twice, but I'm only seeing one copy of each pad—and those 
copies all of post-its on them. That's true of nearly every "Notebook" pdf you provided in the "Message pad 
scans" folder. Would you please get us a scans of these without post-its on them? 
• 
It looks like we're still missing SW returns for the 20 mag 6719 warrant and for the NH premises warrant. 
Would you please get us copies of those returns? 
Following up on our conversation last month, I think we're still waiting on the below items from you guys. Would you 
please be able to get us these this week? 
• 
Full FBI sentinel file 
• 
CART paperwork regarding the extraction of data from all devices seized during the investigation 
• 
All 302s regarding the extraction of data from any seized devices and the review of images (both digital and 
hard copy) seized during the investigation, including from Epstein's properties. 
• 
Scans of the files Reiter provided to the FBI and provide us with all of those scanned materials 
• 
Scans of all hard copy documents, including photos, in the possession of the FBI that have not yet been 
scanned, including anything seized during any searches. Please produce to SDNY all of those scans, except any 
nude or partially nude images. For nude or partially nude images, please provide us with a log detailing how 
many such images were scanned, where they were from, and where they are being stored. 
• 
Copies of the contents of all the discs that were seized and searched pursuant to search warrants to a platform 
for review. Then please produce to SDNY a copy all of those materials, except any nude or partially nude 
images. For nude or partially nude images, please provide us with a log detailing how many such images were 
located, where they were from, and where they are being stored. 
Please let me know if you have any questions or if it would be useful to hop on a call.

No way to put a confidential stamp on a excel file. There should be an image placeholder that says document produced in 
native format which has the confidential stamp.

These look great. One quick question, on documents in native format (excel files) is there a confidential 
stamp? I've checked and it seems the answer is no but I just want to be sure that I'm not missing anything.

Yes, we want to mark all of them confidential 
2. 
We are working on that. 
3. 
I suppose database load files? We want to retain the files as they are currently formatted as best we can. 
4. 
That won't be an issue. I don't think we will be searching through them; the purpose is just to be able to stamp 
them.

Today our office is sending via FedEx a new drive containing additional discovery for Ghislaine Maxwell. For your 
reference, attached are the cover letters. Would you (or someone at the MDC) please keep an eye out for this and make 
sure it gets to Maxwell as soon as it arrives? Her attorneys have been complaining about delays between when we send 
the drives and when they get to Maxwell. 
Thanks so much, as always, for all of your help.

Thanks for following up on this. If it's okay with you, I think it makes sense to connect you with the plaintiff's attorney, 
Jack Scarola, so that he can convey this to you directly. I have spoken with him and explained the context here, and he has

We haven't found a governing protective order, but to be safe, would you be able to get a letter or email from 
attorney stating that they are not aware of a protective order/agreement governing the disclosure of the transcript, and 
to the extent one existed, they are waiving any provisions in order to permit the Estate to provide the transcript to the US 
Attorney's Office, and that they will not claim, in any forum, that the Co-Executors, the Estate, or any representatives of 
either, breached any such order/agreement in that case by providing the transcript to the US Attorney's Office. 
Let us know if that works on your end.

Chris, 
As I mentioned on our call, our office is processing those non-nude images for production, and we will let you know when 
they are ready to be loaded onto drives for you and your client. As is the case with any items that were seized during the 
FBI's searches of Epstein's residences in New York and the Virgin Islands, and as noted in my letter dated August 21, 2020, 
if you wish to review those photographs—or any other items from those searches—yourself before that production is 
ready, we can schedule a time for you to go to the FBI offices and review them. 
To the extent you are reiterating your request from yesterday afternoon that the FBI bring a laptop containing those 
images to the MDC for you and your client to review together, we are already working with the FBI on the logistics of 
loading the files and transporting them to the MDC. Due to the large number files, this will take a few days. I will let you 
know as soon as those logistics are sorted and the FBI is able to bring the files to the MDC for you and your client to 
review. 
Best,

Everything with the exception of a couple of items are ready. I will get you an actual number before I send it over. 
We can send it over tomorrow. There will be ReadMe files included so it will be easy to see where the items came from. I 
am a little worried about how the e-mail will present. While looking through on a spot check, the attachments are not 
connected to the e-mails in the forensic tool. I believe it is a function of the e-mail client they were using to begin with. I 
know that the attachments are a concern of yours. We may have to massage things a bit to get it right. Now that we are 
working every day, and everything has been processed, it shouldn't be too big a deal. So far the export is about 350 GB. It 
copies slowly because it is a ton of pretty small files. You are getting the whole ball of wax, here, Macs, Windows boxes, 
loose media, etc. There will be a few iPhone and iPad reports, but unsure if I can get you those tomorrow as they very 
often take a LONG time to copy. Again, lots of small files. If not tomorrow, the next day. 
Are you around tomorrow? Reach out to me when you get the production so we can correct any problems we might 
encounter. Thanks.

I understand that some number of the devices are ready to come to us as early as today or tomorrow. Could you please 
let us know the following information, so we can figure out who the hard drive should go to in the first instance: 
1. How many total devices are coming to us in this initial production? 
1. What are those devices — i.e., type of device and which ones, from the spreadsheets you've sent? 
2. What's the total volume of data coming in this round of production? 
Once we know that, I can let the agents know where the drive needs to go in the first instance.

You are getting both NY and USVI. The biggest stumbling block are the newer Mac items that are in APFS

I am in the process of exporting the materials (documents, spreadsheets, emails, etc) for your review as per my 
discussions with 
. Most of the NY stuff is done, just Mac items left. This might take a few days as 1 item in 
particular has over 500,000 emails. We will be able to provide discovery once Defense Council has provided 
drives for us to copy items over to. This goes quicker as there is no processing involved. I'll let you know when 
everything is complete.

Also, the related critical question that I don't think we have clarity on is whether you're giving us a copy of everything that 
was collected (including reproducing the materials that you previously gave us, but which are not searchable), or have you

figured out a way to categorize the prior productions so they're useful for us? We would strongly prefer to just

Unfortunately, recent events and our staffing levels have conspired to put a kink in just about everything. If we 
can't make heads or tails of the stuff I've already produced, we'll do it again. They have told us that our staffing 
levels will be steadily increasing over the next few weeks, but I'm going to have to push back my estimate by a 
week or 2. Sorry about that. My next day in the office is Thursday, so I'll be able to see if I can easily identify 
what I already gave you and many it to a reliable identifier.

And related to that question, are we still on track to get the full range of data in the next week or so? I don't think we've

Updated item descriptions. Just a side note, many thumb drives and SD cards will not have a serial number 
visible externally, but will report one through our tools. I included those electronically reported serial numbers. 
Any questions, let me know.

Thanks for this, it's a helpful start. In terms of being able to write our search warrant, one additional piece of information 
we need is the serial number, or some other specific identifier, ideally for each device but at least for any device that there 
is more than one of the same thing. So for example, we need to be able to somehow differentiate the following devices — 
The two Dell power edge T310 hard drives (NYCO24323 and NYCO24324) 
The two Sony Vaio laptop / Fujitsu hdd (NYCO24336 and NYCO24337) 
the following loose storage devices: 
o Micro SD card (NYCO24339) 
o Flash Drive (generic) (NYCO24340) 
o Thumbdrive (Emtec) (NYCO24341) 
o hard drive (loose) (NYCO24342) 
o verbatim thumbdrive (NYCO24343) 
The four San Disk cruzer-thumbdrives (NYCO24344-47) 
The three Seagate IDE hard drives (NYCO24348-50) 
The camera SD card (NYCO24351) 
I think the rest of the devices are either specifically distinguishable and/or have an S/N listed. (By comparison, the USVI 
spreadsheet we have lists an s/n for about 20 of the 25(ish) devices. 
The other thing we're looking for is the location in the house (and ideally specific location) for each device, which the USVI 
list also has — is that info available? 
The list also has just five devices as still pending to be transferred to us, and I think it's right that the plan is to reproduce 
all the materials so that we can get them in searchable format, but just wanted to confirm? Currently, we aren't able to 
match any of the prior productions to specific devices — so if we're able to match them up by Bates number now, that 
might work, but otherwise I think it makes sense for us to get everything. But let us know if any issue with that.

Here is The listing of all the evidence gathered in NY that I have. I added some columns to guide you to the 
unique numbers CART NY uses fro their evidence. The template wasn't a slam dunk over, so I did what I could to 
convey the information. If you are confused by anything, please let me know. In the column for approximate 
size, it is in GB, totaled at the bottom and converted to TB. In the materials contained column, I put what load 
file group the data was transferred over in (Mac, Windows, Loose Media, IDE, or Blacklight) If there is no entry 
in that column, that data has yet to be transferred. There are 2 Macs and a DVR you don't have as well as an 
iPhone and an iPad. IF the descriptions are a bit light, let me know and I'll do what I can to beef them up. I will 
get you the Island stuff tomorrow.

Respectfully, I think there are some miscommunications here — all we have asked is to receive the materials in a format 
such that we can view them using a system we have access to. We're not able to get web-enabled access through any FBI 
tool, so we asked for the materials to be transferred in a loadable format so we could put them on Relativity, which both 
we and the agents can access. We're required to have the files in a format that we can produce them to defense counsel. 
I've done that in many other cases and it hasn't previously been an issue. My understanding from =I is that the best 
way to do it now is just for us (the U.S. Attorney's Office) to get the original files, which our vendor will process—by which 
I just mean converting into file formats that are loadable onto Relativity. It doesn't really have anything to do with the 
taint review—we have to have access to the docs in our systems for discovery purposes. 
And we were happy to get the materials as they were processed, but when we received the 1.1 million documents earlier 
this year, they were in a format that wasn't usable for the reasons described in the email I sent on March 9. Again, I 
understand from =I that the best way forward is to just get copies of the materials in their original formats, which I 
understand will be segregated and designated by device. That should work for us! I was just trying to understand the 
approach, as well as the timeline. 
thanks,

Just to be clear. The US Attorney's Office (or it's contractors) are not "processing" anything. You are taking files 
that I will be extracting from processed evidence and putting them into an E-Discovery tool (Relativity) to do a 
taint review. 
Relativity is NOT a forensic tool. It is incapable of dealing with many things that are found forensically on a 
computer like free space, slack space, and system files to name a few. When we started this, and you insisted 
you do the taint review in Relativity, I warned you that it was adding months worth of work on top of what was 
already done, and that Relativity was incapable of viewing everything. You insisted we do it this way. So now 
and I have come up with a way to fit this round peg into this square hole. We will get it done. 
Sorry it has taken so long, but we are talking about terabytes worth of data over multiple forms of digital 
evidence. Phones, tablets, loose media, cameras, DVRs, servers, laptops, and desktop computers. We have 
gotten past encryption on multiple devices. When we review devices on such large cases, we usually do it piece 
by piece as things are processed, I was unaware that you didn't want to review as things were processed, that 
you wanted to do it "all at once", so that added to the delay. Sorry for that. Just a differentiation of 
methodology I suppose. 
and I feel confident that the method we have come up with will be more consistent and preserve the 
attribution of files to devices and links of e-mails to attachments that the load file generation that I did a while 
back was lacking.

Okay, so just to check, you both think that there is not a need to do a test run? You're both comfortable with just basically 
sending us copies of everything? I don't totally understand why we couldn't have done that eight months ago, but 
regardless of the passage of time, I want to make sure we understand so we can report to our supervisors. I assume that 
means that we (at the U.S. Attorney's Office and through contractors) will therefore need to do all the processing 
ourselves, correct? And thanks again to you both.

Like

In terms of data transfer, 
are you just sending a literal copy of all the raw data, and we'll process and upload it on

make sure it transfers correctly, before sending over literally everything — is that still the plan?

Unfortunately I don't think this is very helpful to us. Did you take a look at the example spreadsheet I sent on 2/24? The 
excel file you sent has descriptions that don't match up to the items listed in the search warrant returns (that we sent on 
EFTA00023723
--- PAGE 15 ---
2/23), and we don't have the 1B or CART numbers to be able to cross-reference. We also can't tell what you mean by 
"loose media" without a specific comparison to what was seized, we don't know which items you're referring to as 
"Windows machines," and we can't tell whether the entirety of any particular item has been transferred, or just partial. 
For example, it looks like we have gotten very, very few image files, which is surprising. 
We have also encountered some very significant problems in trying to review the more than 1 million documents we 
recently received: 
The data we've received has no way to put any emails and attachments together. So if an email says, "see the 
attached flight records," for example, we have no way of linking that up with the records themselves. Not only is 
that a big problem for us in review, it's going to be a huge problem for producing the documents to defense 
counsel. 
The load file has no link to the native file, so when we load the data to the database, there's no way to have the 
native files show up in the database. Because many of the files are too large to open in the viewer, it effectively 
means that there are many files that are completely invisible to us. 
Related, the control numbers in the load file don't match up to the native files. So we have two sets of numbers 
and no way to match up anything—that is, even if we were to try to go hunt down every individual large file in the 
native files, it would be impossible. 
So the data that we most recently got, we need to get in a form that addresses those issues, and we likely will need to get 
a similar reproduction of the data we received a couple months ago. Otherwise we're sifting through more than a million 
documents without much rhyme or reason. 
I've re-attached the spreadsheet we sent last week — I think that's a good place to start in terms of our necessary record-
keeping, and we need that info at the very least, as well as anything else you think would be useful. Also attaching the SW 
returns for reference. And again, we're happy to meet up anytime and hash all this out in person if that's useful.

Here is a listing of what I have already handed over in load files to the US Attorney's Office for taint review. Some points of 
clarification: There were 9 IDE hard drives found in the Manhattan apartment, they turned out to be 3 copies of 3 drives 
(9 drives in total) from a July 2007 search on one of his properties. I only processed 3 (as they were all copies). All the 
loose media from the NY apartment is included. All the Windows machines from the NY apartment are included. Only 2 
Macs from NY and 1 from the Island are included. 
I will have to more closely coordinate with whoever is loading up Relativity with the remaining Macs as the tool 
they have to be processed with does not easily re-name the load files. 
Spreadsheet is attached.

what I think would be most helpful to facilitate that would be a spreadsheet of each separate device referenced in the two 
search warrant returns, with columns for whether we've dumped the contents, whether they've been reviewed and/or 
transferred, what portions were transferred, etc. 
Something roughly like the attached, with any other categories you think would be useful — and the info on the attached is 
mostly hypothetical, obviously, just as examples. That will help us fully understand what's been reviewed, transferred, 
and received so far, and what remains. 
(Also just on the pictures, we do want copies of those as well, please including from the discs and the devices — I think FBI 
was going to do an initial screen to make sure no CP, and since I think the answer was no, we'll need to get those to be 
able to review them as well.)

Sony for the delayed response. They are tearing out our old network and giving us a new one, they mandated we 
delete old stuff (about 400 TB worth). Now that they are working on replacing the network, we can do only local 
work. I should be able to give you an accounting of what is what. I can say, off the top of my head, that all 
windows based items from the NY search have been handed over as well as all loose media. The CDs from NY 
only contained pictures, no documents. There are still some Apple items from NY that need to be produced. As 
far as the Island stuff goes, the 1st item on your spreadsheet, the "kitchen" mac has been produced. Still working

Based on the attached search warrant returns, it looks like from the New York mansion (the PDF) there are approximately 
devices that would have storage (computers, hard drives, thumb drives, etc.) and that's not even counting at least 60+

I'm not sure who's the exact right person to ask this, so wanted to get everybody on one email chain about it — I have the 
hard drive that 
dropped off that has new Epstein search warrant materials, but it looks like there are also old 
materials (that I think we had previously received and uploaded??) on the hard drive, and so I'm not sure what's new. 
Just generally, and 
and I talked about this last week too, but it's basically impossible for us to keep track of what 
we're getting, and what has been completed, without some kind of identification or labeling system, along with a list of 
which devices have been extracted and downloaded. 
So for example on the hard drive currently, there are 38 folders labeled "loadFiles" through "37loadFiles" with a modified 
date of 11/14/19, which I think we may have already previously received — but I'm not sure, because we haven't gotten 
any info on which folders match up to which devices, etc. And then there's another folder titled "NYC024362" that has a 
modified date of 1/27/20, so I think that may be the materials we hadn't previously received? That folder by itself has 
more than 600,000 items. 
I don't want to give 
anything that we've already previously received and uploaded, and I can't tell from the folder or 
file names whether everything on the drive is new, or whether just additional materials were saved onto it in addition to 
what we already have. =, 
are you able to give us some guidance on this? Ultimately what we really need is a 
spreadsheet of every device, whether it's been dumped (or partially dumped), and then identifying that same info —
which device, and what materials from it — are being given to us with each data transfer. Otherwise I think 
organizationally and for review purposes it will be a total disaster for us. 
We're happy to have a meeting on this if that's helpful — and thanks everybody for the assistance.

If it's huge, he said he should look at it first, to make sure it's in a format that they can deal with, and if it's small it can go 
directly to PAE (since even if it's screwed up, they won't take much time on it). 
But also, it likely won't be clear what we're getting from the hard drive itself, so given that we're receiving a subset of the 
devices, we just want to know which ones are on the drive. 
All that said, if he doesn't respond, we'll just take the drive and send it to M.

I wouldn't count on a response from 
— he won't response quickly, and we'll end up annoyed. Just out of curiosity, 
what is the significance of knowing what is on the drive before sending to PAE? Is there any particular work 
is doing 
in his initial review that we need done?

We didn't get any devices yesterday, but 
said that 
is picking up the hard drive from 
today. I spoke 
with 
who normally takes an initial look at this stuff (but is working remotely). Depending on the volume, the 
devices will either go to him or directly to PAE. Just need to know from 
what we're actually getting.

Once we know that, I can let the agents know where the drive needs to go in the first instance.

You are getting both NY and USVI. The biggest stumbling block are the newer Mac items that are in APFS 
(there are a bunch from the Island,) so it is difficult to estimate how long those will take until I see how many

I am in the process of exporting the materials (documents, spreadsheets, emails, etc) for your review as per my 
discussions with 
. Most of the NY stuff is done, just Mac items left. This might take a few days as 1 item in 
particular has over 500,000 emails. We will be able to provide discovery once Defense Council has provided 
drives for us to copy items over to. This goes quicker as there is no processing involved. I'll let you know when 
everything is complete.

Wanted to circle back on this and check in, particularly because we desperately need to get the results from the July and 
September searches before moving forward with possible additional charges in the case. I know you had mentioned you 
needed to push back your prior estimate of complete production by early June, by a couple weeks, so wanted to see what 
the current estimate is? I don't think we've started to get anything yet but please correct me if I'm wrong.

Unfortunately, recent events and our staffing levels have conspired to put a kink in just about everything. If we 
can't make heads or tails of the stuff I've already produced, we'll do it again. They have told us that our staffing 
levels will be steadily increasing over the next few weeks, but I'm going to have to push back my estimate by a 
week or 2. Sorry about that. My next day in the office is Thursday, so I'll be able to see if I can easily identify

Thanks for this, it's a helpful start. In terms of being able to write our search warrant, one additional piece of information 
we need is the serial number, or some other specific identifier, ideally for each device but at least for any device that there 
is more than one of the same thing. So for example, we need to be able to somehow differentiate the following devices — 
The two Dell power edge T310 hard drives (NYCO24323 and NYCO24324) 
The two Sony Vaio laptop / Fujitsu hdd (NYCO24336 and NYCO24337) 
the following loose storage devices: 
o Micro SD card (NYCO24339) 
o Flash Drive (generic) (NYCO24340) 
o Thumbdrive (Emtec) (NYCO24341) 
o hard drive (loose) (NYCO24342) 
o verbatim thumbdrive (NYCO24343) 
The four San Disk cruzer-thumbdrives (NYCO24344-47) 
The three Seagate IDE hard drives (NYCO24348-50) 
The camera SD card (NYCO24351) 
I think the rest of the devices are either specifically distinguishable and/or have an S/N listed. (By comparison, the USVI 
spreadsheet we have lists an s/n for about 20 of the 25(ish) devices. 
The other thing we're looking for is the location in the house (and ideally specific location) for each device, which the USVI 
list also has — is that info available? 
The list also has just five devices as still pending to be transferred to us, and I think it's right that the plan is to reproduce 
all the materials so that we can get them in searchable format, but just wanted to confirm? Currently, we aren't able to 
match any of the prior productions to specific devices — so if we're able to match them up by Bates number now, that

Here is The listing of all the evidence gathered in NY that I have. I added some columns to guide you to the 
unique numbers CART NY uses fro their evidence. The template wasn't a slam dunk over, so I did what I could to 
convey the information. If you are confused by anything, please let me know. In the column for approximate 
EFTA00023734

size, it is in GB, totaled at the bottom and converted to TB. In the materials contained column, I put what load 
file group the data was transferred over in (Mac, Windows, Loose Media, IDE, or Blacklight) If there is no entry 
in that column, that data has yet to be transferred. There are 2 Macs and a DVR you don't have as well as an 
iPhone and an iPad. IF the descriptions are a bit light, let me know and I'll do what I can to beef them up. I will

Respectfully, I think there are some miscommunications here — all we have asked is to receive the materials in a format 
such that we can view them using a system we have access to. We're not able to get web-enabled access through any FBI 
tool, so we asked for the materials to be transferred in a loadable format so we could put them on Relativity, which both 
we and the agents can access. We're required to have the files in a format that we can produce them to defense counsel. 
I've done that in many other cases and it hasn't previously been an issue. My understanding from =I is that the best 
way to do it now is just for us (the U.S. Attorney's Office) to get the original files, which our vendor will process—by which 
I just mean converting into file formats that are loadable onto Relativity. It doesn't really have anything to do with the 
taint review—we have to have access to the docs in our systems for discovery purposes. 
And we were happy to get the materials as they were processed, but when we received the 1.1 million documents earlier 
this year, they were in a format that wasn't usable for the reasons described in the email I sent on March 9. Again, I 
understand from =I that the best way forward is to just get copies of the materials in their original formats, which I 
understand will be segregated and designated by device. That should work for us! I was just trying to understand the 
approach, as well as the timeline.

Just to be clear. The US Attorney's Office (or it's contractors) are not "processing" anything. You are taking files 
that I will be extracting from processed evidence and putting them into an E-Discovery tool (Relativity) to do a 
EFTA00023735
--- PAGE 9 ---
taint review. 
Relativity is NOT a forensic tool. It is incapable of dealing with many things that are found forensically on a 
computer like free space, slack space, and system files to name a few. When we started this, and you insisted 
you do the taint review in Relativity, I warned you that it was adding months worth of work on top of what was 
already done, and that Relativity was incapable of viewing everything. You insisted we do it this way. So now 
and I have come up with a way to fit this round peg into this square hole. We will get it done. 
Sorry it has taken so long, but we are talking about terabytes worth of data over multiple forms of digital 
evidence. Phones, tablets, loose media, cameras, DVRs, servers, laptops, and desktop computers. We have 
gotten past encryption on multiple devices. When we review devices on such large cases, we usually do it piece 
by piece as things are processed, I was unaware that you didn't want to review as things were processed, that 
you wanted to do it "all at once", so that added to the delay. Sorry for that. Just a differentiation of 
methodology I suppose. 
and I feel confident that the method we have come up with will be more consistent and preserve the 
attribution of files to devices and links of e-mails to attachments that the load file generation that I did a while 
back was lacking.

Okay, so just to check, you both think that there is not a need to do a test run? You're both comfortable with just basically 
sending us copies of everything? I don't totally understand why we couldn't have done that eight months ago, but 
regardless of the passage of time, I want to make sure we understand so we can report to our supervisors. I assume that 
means that we (at the U.S. Attorney's Office and through contractors) will therefore need to do all the processing 
ourselves, correct? And thanks again to you both.

Following up on the below, I think you had said you expected to be able to get us a list of the devices seized from the 
search warrants at Epstein's residences in New York and the USVI, as well as from his person upon arrest, in about a 
month (during our conference call a month ago) — so wanted to check if we can still expect that very soon? We're waiting 
on that list to be able to do an updated search warrant on all of those devices. Please let us know the current timeline —
and also the current timeline on producing the results from those August and September searches? I think you and 
were going to coordinate on that, and you had mentioned you expected we'd have it a couple months from our call, which 
would be about a month from now. Wanted to make sure we're still on track.

Yes, I can do anytime tomorrow, and 
can also join anytime tomorrow. So whenever is good on your end. 
Also, we can host a conference call, but only up to six lines at a time — so if FBI has larger capacity than that let us know, 
otherwise I'd propose we do:

Following up on this from a month ago — I know we're living in a different world than what existed four weeks ago, but are 
you at all able to assist while working remotely? This has been pending for almost two months and we still don't have a 
very basic list of each device or item that was seized and searched, or for which of those we've received materials. We're 
happy to have a call if that would be useful, but as a first step the most basic thing we're looking for is the info in the 
template spreadsheet we sent earlier (that's also attached).

Unfortunately I don't think this is very helpful to us. Did you take a look at the example spreadsheet I sent on 2/24? The 
excel file you sent has descriptions that don't match up to the items listed in the search warrant returns (that we sent on 
2/23), and we don't have the 1B or CART numbers to be able to cross-reference. We also can't tell what you mean by 
"loose media" without a specific comparison to what was seized, we don't know which items you're referring to as 
"Windows machines," and we can't tell whether the entirety of any particular item has been transferred, or just partial. 
For example, it looks like we have gotten very, very few image files, which is surprising. 
We have also encountered some very significant problems in trying to review the more than 1 million documents we 
recently received: 
EFTA00023740
--- PAGE 14 ---
The data we've received has no way to put any emails and attachments together. So if an email says, "see the 
attached flight records," for example, we have no way of linking that up with the records themselves. Not only is 
that a big problem for us in review, it's going to be a huge problem for producing the documents to defense 
counsel. 
The load file has no link to the native file, so when we load the data to the database, there's no way to have the 
native files show up in the database. Because many of the files are too large to open in the viewer, it effectively 
means that there are many files that are completely invisible to us. 
Related, the control numbers in the load file don't match up to the native files. So we have two sets of numbers 
and no way to match up anything—that is, even if we were to try to go hunt down every individual large file in the 
native files, it would be impossible. 
So the data that we most recently got, we need to get in a form that addresses those issues, and we likely will need to get 
a similar reproduction of the data we received a couple months ago. Otherwise we're sifting through more than a million 
documents without much rhyme or reason. 
I've re-attached the spreadsheet we sent last week — I think that's a good place to start in terms of our necessary record-
keeping, and we need that info at the very least, as well as anything else you think would be useful. Also attaching the SW 
returns for reference. And again, we're happy to meet up anytime and hash all this out in person if that's useful.

Here is a listing of what I have already handed over in load files to the US Attorney's Office for taint review. Some points of 
clarification: There were 9 IDE hard drives found in the Manhattan apartment, they turned out to be 3 copies of 3 drives 
(9 drives in total) from a July 2007 search on one of his properties. I only processed 3 (as they were all copies). All the 
loose media from the NY apartment is included. All the Windows machines from the NY apartment are included. Only 2 
Macs from NY and 1 from the Island are included. 
I will have to more closely coordinate with whoever is loading up Relativity with the remaining Macs as the tool 
they have to be processed with does not easily re-name the load files. 
Spreadsheet is attached.

Totally understand about the network issues—we can relate. I do still think it will be helpful to all sit down together to 
have an in-person discussion, to make sure everybody is on the same page. Are folks available for that next week? And 
what I think would be most helpful to facilitate that would be a spreadsheet of each separate device referenced in the two 
search warrant returns, with columns for whether we've dumped the contents, whether they've been reviewed and/or 
transferred, what portions were transferred, etc. 
Something roughly like the attached, with any other categories you think would be useful — and the info on the attached is 
mostly hypothetical, obviously, just as examples. That will help us fully understand what's been reviewed, transferred, 
and received so far, and what remains.

(Also just on the pictures, we do want copies of those as well, please including from the discs and the devices — I think FBI

able to review them as well.)

Sony for the delayed response. They are tearing out our old network and giving us a new one, they mandated we 
delete old stuff (about 400 TB worth). Now that they are working on replacing the network, we can do only local 
work. I should be able to give you an accounting of what is what. I can say, off the top of my head, that all 
windows based items from the NY search have been handed over as well as all loose media. The CDs from NY 
only contained pictures, no documents. There are still some Apple items from NY that need to be produced. As 
far as the Island stuff goes, the 1st item on your spreadsheet, the "kitchen" mac has been produced. Still working 
on the rest.

Following up on the below from last weekend, I'm still not sure how we're addressing this so I thought it would make 
sense for us to all schedule a (hopefully relatively brief) meeting to all get on the same page? We didn't hear back on 
which files had previously been provided, but our tech folks did their best to differentiate, and we got access to the 
materials yesterday and its well over a million documents, and we don't have any idea what we're looking at — i.e., which 
devices the materials came from, whether it's full or partial results, how many more devices we have coming, etc. 
Based on the attached search warrant returns, it looks like from the New York mansion (the PDF) there are approximately 
devices that would have storage (computers, hard drives, thumb drives, etc.) and that's not even counting at least 60+ 
CDs. And then from the Virgin Islands (the Excel spreadsheet), at least more than 25 devices, including multiple servers / 
server racks. 
So we gotta know what we've already received, what remains, anticipated schedule, etc, and I know it's a lot of moving 
pieces on all sides so wanted to loop in everybody at once. The case team will be in California this coming week from 
Tuesday through Friday, but then I think generally around the first week of March, which will hopefully be plenty of time 
to schedule a productive meeting.

I'm not sure who's the exact right person to ask this, so wanted to get everybody on one email chain about it — I have the 
hard drive that 
dropped off that has new Epstein search warrant materials, but it looks like there are also old 
materials (that I think we had previously received and uploaded??) on the hard drive, and so I'm not sure what's new. 
Just generally, and 
and I talked about this last week too, but it's basically impossible for us to keep track of what 
we're getting, and what has been completed, without some kind of identification or labeling system, along with a list of 
which devices have been extracted and downloaded. 
So for example on the hard drive currently, there are 38 folders labeled "loadFiles" through "37loadFiles" with a modified 
date of 11/14/19, which I think we may have already previously received — but I'm not sure, because we haven't gotten 
any info on which folders match up to which devices, etc. And then there's another folder titled "NYC024362" that has a 
modified date of 1/27/20, so I think that may be the materials we hadn't previously received? That folder by itself has 
more than 600,000 items. 
I don't want to give I= 
anything that we've already previously received and uploaded, and I can't tell from the folder or 
file names whether everything on the drive is new, or whether just additional materials were saved onto it in addition to 
what we already have. =, 
are you able to give us some guidance on this? Ultimately what we really need is a 
spreadsheet of every device, whether it's been dumped (or partially dumped), and then identifying that same info —
which device, and what materials from it — are being given to us with each data transfer. Otherwise I think 
organizationally and for review purposes it will be a total disaster for us. 
We're happy to have a meeting on this if that's helpful — and thanks everybody for the assistance.

Jack, 
Thanks for speaking with me earlier today. The attorneys I mentioned are Marc Weinstein and Andrew Tomback, who 
represent the executors of Epstein's estate. I've provided them with your contact information, and as we discussed, they 
will likely be in touch to discuss whether you have any objections to them providing the transcript to us. 
On this subject, I wanted to let you know that our communications with the estate's attorneys about your client have 
been limited to our request for the transcript. We have not shared any details regarding your client or her cooperation 
with our investigation.

Re: 
United States v. Tom Noel, No. 19 Cr. 830 
Dear Mr. Foy: 
We write in response to your discovery request letter, dated June 5, 2020. Many of the 
items requested in your letter were previously produced to the defendant in discovery, and to the 
extent they were not, that is because they were not in the Government's possession. While, as the 
Court has already ruled, the Government has no obligation to gather additional documents from 
the Bureau of Prisons ("BOP") in response to a discovery request, and you identify no authority to 
the contrary in your request, as a courtesy, the Government made a supplemental request to the 
BOP for certain records responsive to your requests and that appear to have at least some relevance 
to the issues related to this case. Pursuant to that supplemental request, the BOP began producing 
records to our Office on or around June 24, 2020, and we are now producing those materials to 
you. This letter and the content herein is designated as "Protected Materials" pursuant to the 
Protective Order entered in this matter. By contrast, as set forth herein, the Government has not 
requested materials not already in its possession that do not seem to have any relevance to this 
case, although we are happy to discuss the basis for any such request at your convenience. 
Request No. I. Defendant Noel's complete personnel and training file. 
The Government has already produced the entirety of the defendant's training and 
personnel file in its possession at SDNY_00006228-06273.

and is producing it at SDNY_TN_00020855-020857.

corresponding employee acknowledgement forms for Defendant Noel.

Program Statement regarding Employee Code of Conduct, P.S. 3420.11; Noel's acknowledgement 
form; and the U.S. Department of Justice Ethics Handbook for On and Off-Duty Conduct from

FYI below, the FBI says its dropping off extractions of nearly all the remaining devices tomorrow. Why after ten months of 
nothing we were able to get literally everything in a week is absolutely beyond me, but hopefully the data they get us is 
correct, accurate, and workable. We should be able to get the drive sent to =copied here) tomorrow, and then if it all 
looks okay, likely out tom for processing and upload next week. Will keep everyone posted as always.

Here is a listing of what I have already handed over in load files to the US Attorney's Office for taint review. Some points of 
clarification: There were 9 IDE hard drives found in the Manhattan apartment, they turned out to be 3 copies of 3 drives 
(9 drives in total) from a July 2007 search on one of his properties. I only processed 3 (as they were all copies). All the 
loose media from the NY apartment is included. All the Windows machines from the NY apartment are included. Only 2 
Macs from NY and 1 from the Island are included. 
I will have to more closely coordinate with whoever is loading up Relativity with the remaining Macs as the tool 
they have to be processed with does not easily re-name the load files. 
Spreadsheet is attached.

Totally understand about the network issues—we can relate. I do still think it will be helpful to all sit down together to 
have an in-person discussion, to make sure everybody is on the same page. Are folks available for that next week? And 
what I think would be most helpful to facilitate that would be a spreadsheet of each separate device referenced in the two 
search warrant returns, with columns for whether we've dumped the contents, whether they've been reviewed and/or 
transferred, what portions were transferred, etc. 
Something roughly like the attached, with any other categories you think would be useful — and the info on the attached is 
mostly hypothetical, obviously, just as examples. That will help us fully understand what's been reviewed, transferred, 
and received so far, and what remains. 
(Also just on the pictures, we do want copies of those as well, please including from the discs and the devices — I think FBI 
was going to do an initial screen to make sure no CP, and since I think the answer was no, we'll need to get those to be 
able to review them as well.)

Sorry for the delayed response. They are tearing out our old network and giving us a new one, they mandated we 
delete old stuff (about 400 TB worth). Now that they are working on replacing the network, we can do only local 
work. I should be able to give you an accounting of what is what. I can say, off the top of my head, that all 
windows based items from the NY search have been handed over as well as all loose media. The CDs from NY 
only contained pictures, no documents. There are still some Apple items from NY that need to be produced. As 
far as the Island stuff goes, the 1st item on your spreadsheet, the "kitchen" mac has been produced. Still working 
on the rest.

Following up on the below from last weekend, I'm still not sure how we're addressing this so I thought it would make 
sense for us to all schedule a (hopefully relatively brief) meeting to all get on the same page? We didn't hear back on 
which files had previously been provided, but our tech folks did their best to differentiate, and we got access to the 
materials yesterday and its well over a million documents, and we don't have any idea what we're looking at — i.e., which 
devices the materials came from, whether it's full or partial results, how many more devices we have coming, etc. 
Based on the attached search warrant returns, it looks like from the New York mansion (the PDF) there are approximately 
devices that would have storage (computers, hard drives, thumb drives, etc.) and that's not even counting at least 60+ 
CDs. And then from the Virgin Islands (the Excel spreadsheet), at least more than 25 devices, including multiple servers / 
server racks. 
So we gotta know what we've already received, what remains, anticipated schedule, etc, and I know it's a lot of moving 
pieces on all sides so wanted to loop in everybody at once. The case team will be in California this coming week from 
Tuesday through Friday, but then I think generally around the first week of March, which will hopefully be plenty of time 
to schedule a productive meeting.

I'm not sure who's the exact right person to ask this, so wanted to get everybody on one email chain about it — I have the 
hard drive that 
dropped off that has new Epstein search warrant materials, but it looks like there are also old 
materials (that I think we had previously received and uploaded??) on the hard drive, and so I'm not sure what's new. 
Just generally, and 
and I talked about this last week too, but it's basically impossible for us to keep track of what 
we're getting, and what has been completed, without some kind of identification or labeling system, along with a list of 
which devices have been extracted and downloaded. 
EFTA00023776
--- PAGE 4 ---
So for example on the hard drive currently, there are 38 folders labeled "loadFiles" through "37loadFiles" with a modified 
date of 11/14/19, which I think we may have already previously received — but I'm not sure, because we haven't gotten 
any info on which folders match up to which devices, etc. And then there's another folder titled "NYC024362" that has a 
modified date of 1/27/20, so I think that may be the materials we hadn't previously received? That folder by itself has 
more than 600,000 items. 
I don't want to give 
anything that we've already previously received and uploaded, and I can't tell from the folder or 
file names whether everything on the drive is new, or whether just additional materials were saved onto it in addition to 
what we already have. =, 
are you able to give us some guidance on this? Ultimately what we really need is a 
spreadsheet of every device, whether it's been dumped (or partially dumped), and then identifying that same info —
which device, and what materials from it — are being given to us with each data transfer. Otherwise I think 
organizationally and for review purposes it will be a total disaster for us. 
We're happy to have a meeting on this if that's helpful — and thanks everybody for the assistance.

Jennifer Richardson 
Gary, 
We write to follow up on our conversation yesterday, to confirm certain aspects of our discussion and to provide certain 
information you requested. First, thank you for conveying your questions, and I hope our initial responses were of some 
use. To provide additional information that may be helpful, attached please find a blank proffer agreement, which is our 
standard form agreement for proffer interviews, as you requested. Please note that in addition to the provisions I briefly 
described on our call, there are also provisions that may not be relevant to your client. We nevertheless send the 
complete agreement for your review. 
Additionally, and also as requested, certain information relating to Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001, is provided 
below. 
In relevant part, that statute states the following: "Except as otherwise provided in this section, whoever, in any matter 
within the jurisdiction of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the Government of the United States, knowingly 
and willfully—(1) falsifies, conceals, or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact; (2) makes any materially 
false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation; or (3) makes or uses any false writing or document knowing 
the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry [is guilty of an offense]. The full 
language of the statute is also available here. 
Regarding the elements required to prove such an offense, pursuant to Sand, Modern Federal Jury Instructions, Instruction 
36-3 (Elements of the Offense), a conviction for this offense require that the following elements each must be proven 
beyond a reasonable doubt: 
First, that on or about the date specified in the indictment, the defendant falsified (or concealed or covered up) a 
material fact; 
Second, that the fact falsified (or concealed or covered up) was material; 
Third, that defendant did so by trick, scheme or device; 
Fourth, that defendant acted knowingly and willfully; and 
Fifth, that the falsification, concealment or coverup was with respect to a matter within the jurisdiction of the 
government of the United States (if applicable: or that federal funds were involved). 
You may note in particular the inclusion of the "knowingly and willfully" requirement, as we discussed. 
We also understand that you will send us, to the extent you believe it is relevant or helpful for our consideration, any 
particular provisions or protections contemplated under the MLAT process, and which of those, if any, you believe are 
relevant, or should be applicable, to a voluntary interview. 
We look forward to speaking with you again this coming Monday, August 3, at 4:00 p.m. (LDN time), and we further 
confirm, as discussed, that our Office is prepared to extend the Negotiation Period, referenced in our email of July 14, 
2020, for two weeks from our call yesterday, to August 10, 2020, under the terms previously mutually agreed upon.

In response to your July 13 email, we are prepared to enter into a limited period of confidential negotiations regarding 
a voluntary interview of your client, subject to the following conditions: 
I. The confidential negotiation period shall last no more than two weeks, starting today, and ending at the end of the 
day on July 28, 2020 (the "Negotiation Period"); 
2. Both sides agree that the fact of the Negotiation Period, as well as any communications made during the 
Negotiation Period, shall be treated as confidential, and shall not be the subject of any public comments; 
3. If, as the result of negotiations conducted during the Negotiation Period, your client completes a voluntary 
interview with U.S. authorities, either side may publicly confirm that your client met with United States law 
enforcement authorities and answered questions about matters under investigation. Neither party, or their 
representatives, shall comment further on the circumstances or substance of the interview. 
4. Alternatively, if, at the end of the Negotiation Period, no agreement is reached, the parties will jointly inform the 
appropriate authorities in the UK and US that the parties are not able to reach agreement on a voluntary interview 
and accordingly a voluntary interview will not occur. 
We believe these conditions directly address your stated concerns while allowing us to satisfy ourselves that all sides 
are endeavoring in good faith to either expeditiously reach agreement on a voluntary interview or reach agreement 
that no such interview will occur. 
Please inform us as soon as possible if you are amenable to this proposal. If so, we are prepared to schedule a call at 
your earliest convenience to discuss arrangements for the interview.

Dear 
Geoffrey Berman and Audrey Strauss have persistently commented about the prospects and purpose of 
interviewing the Duke of York, prompting widespread media coverage. We regard that commentary as 
improper. Your offer to refrain from publicly commenting on the substance of any witness interview and 
general assurances about your standard practice are clearly insufficient to prevent the DoJ and the SDNY 
from encouraging a media circus around the process of arranging for and the Duke attending any interview. 
All we are asking for at this stage is an undertaking of confidentiality in relation to the discussion of dates, 
concerns and arrangements in relation to any interview. This is no more than would be good practice in the 
UK and we invite you provide an assurance in this regard.

Gary, 
While we do not think it would be productive to rehash the history of our communications, we have always been and 
remain open to a voluntary interview in lieu of one compelled under U.K. law. However, your client has neither 
offered nor agreed to sit for a voluntary interview. That has left us no choice but to pursue a compelled interview. 
You have asked about the confidentiality of any witness interview. We have previously told you, by email dated 
February 4, 2020, and reiterate here, that it is our standard practice to refrain from publicly commenting on the 
substance of any witness interview, and we intend to abide by that practice in this case. It is also our standard 
practice to disclose information provided during a witness interview only in connection with an ongoing criminal 
investigation or proceeding, any related civil or forfeiture proceeding initiated by this Office, or as otherwise 
authorized under U.S. law. We do not voluntarily share information with the press or civil litigants or members of 
the public, and it is entirely unclear why you believe we might do so here. 
Give us a commitment that your client will sit for a voluntary interview with us, give us a date or dates that work for 
you and your client, and we will be happy to schedule a call to discuss any additional arrangements or particular 
concerns you may have. But until we have a commitment from your client to sit for a voluntary interview — and to 
do so on a timeline that reflects the urgency of our ongoing investigation — we will continue to pursue a compelled 
interview through all available legal channels. 
Regards, 
Assistant U.S. Attorney

Dear M, 
Thank you for your email of 2 July 2020, sent late in the evening UK time. 
It appears that there may be cultural differences between UK and US legal practice that are causing 
problems in our communications. Normally in UK practice, any written communication is acknowledged 
promptly and any differences between the parties are identified in that correspondence. Following our 
emails of 3 and 8 June 2020, I had expected the DOJ to at least acknowledge our email of 8 June 2020. I 
did not expect to have to chase for an acknowledgment, let alone a response, on I July 2020. 
I remain very keen to discuss a path for the Duke's voluntary cooperation, without necessity for compelled 
process under the MLAT. I believe that through a cooperative agreement which could be reached, the Duke 
would be able to provide answers to any relevant questions you may have. 
I am disappointed that your email response of 2 July 2020 seems to suggest that the DOJ has no interest in 
discussing the practical arrangements that obviously need to made to allow us to advise the Duke of York 
that he should agree a process under which he provides witness evidence to you. For that discussion to 
take place I would invite you to indicate what protections might be available to ensure that this process is 
fair and does not turn into a media circus. 
Insofar as you complain about our public statement on 8 June 2020, this solitary public comment was 
made in response to what I believe have been highly unusual public statements and persistent and 
deliberate leaks to the press by the DOJ, including the latest leak of the fact that there had been a mutual 
legal assistance request. 
However, I acknowledge that both sides appear to have quite different views as to how we have reached 
this position and who is in the right. May I therefore suggest that we start afresh, and both make a good 
EFTA00023787
--- PAGE 6 ---
faith attempt to reach an agreement which will allow the Duke of York to provide the potential evidence 
you seek. 
I do not believe that this agreement can be achieved by the DOJ unilaterally insisting that the Duke must 
commit to a voluntary cooperation without any guarantee that he would have even the limited protection 
that he would be given in the context of a request for mutual legal assistance. In the mutual legal assistance 
process in the UK, for example, he could only be required to answer questions and provide evidence that 
are demonstrably relevant to a US criminal trial. Whatever evidence he provides may only be used for the 
US criminal proceedings and cannot be given to the press or deployed by civil claimants' lawyers. The 
overall confidentiality of the evidence taking process is supervised by a judge. 
In those circumstances I do urge you to agree that we should at least attempt to iron out the cultural 
differences and practical issues between us by speaking on a call in the very near future. 
I look forward to hearing from you regarding a time you might be available to speak by telephone. 
Kind regards 
Gary

Gary, 
There is nothing under active consideration because you have not proposed anything for consideration. To the 
contrary, in your email of June 8, you stated: "we cannot commit to a particular form of cooperation until we are 
properly informed and assured as to what protections, including as to confidentiality and use, are to pertain." We 
note that notwithstanding your professed interest in confidentiality, that email was followed almost immediately by 
a public release issued in your name that contained any number of false and misleading characterizations of your 
dealings with our Office and your client's purported interest in cooperation. 
If and when you are prepared to arrange a date for your client to sit for an interview with our Office, we assume 
you will let us know, and we will be happy to discuss the particulars of such an interview. Until such an interview 
is arranged, we will continue to report to the authorities in the UK, through the appropriate channels, that there has 
been no offer of a voluntary interview, nor any likelihood of one being scheduled, and that we will therefore have 
no alternative but to pursue a compelled interview via formal request.

Gary, 
In response to your July 13 email, we are prepared to enter into a limited period of confidential negotiations regarding a 
voluntary interview of your client, subject to the following conditions: 
I. The confidential negotiation period shall last no more than two weeks, starting today, and ending at the end of the day 
on July 28, 2020 (the "Negotiation Period"); 
2. Both sides agree that the fact of the Negotiation Period, as well as any communications made during the Negotiation 
Period, shall be treated as confidential, and shall not be the subject of any public comments; 
3. If, as the result of negotiations conducted during the Negotiation Period, your client completes a voluntary interview 
with U.S. authorities, either side may publicly confirm that your client met with United States law enforcement 
authorities and answered questions about matters under investigation. Neither party, or their representatives, shall 
comment further on the circumstances or substance of the interview. 
4. Alternatively, if, at the end of the Negotiation Period, no agreement is reached, the parties will jointly inform the 
appropriate authorities in the UK and US that the parties are not able to reach agreement on a voluntary interview and 
accordingly a voluntary interview will not occur. 
We believe these conditions directly address your stated concerns while allowing us to satisfy ourselves that all sides are 
endeavoring in good faith to either expeditiously reach agreement on a voluntary interview or reach agreement that no 
such interview will occur. 
Please inform us as soon as possible if you are amenable to this proposal. If so, we are prepared to schedule a call at your 
earliest convenience to discuss arrangements for the interview.

Dear 
Geoffrey Berman and Audrey Strauss have persistently commented about the prospects and purpose of 
interviewing the Duke of York, prompting widespread media coverage. We regard that commentary as 
improper. Your offer to refrain from publicly commenting on the substance of any witness interview and 
general assurances about your standard practice are clearly insufficient to prevent the DoJ and the SDNY from 
encouraging a media circus around the process of arranging for and the Duke attending any interview. 
All we are asking for at this stage is an undertaking of confidentiality in relation to the discussion of dates, 
concerns and arrangements in relation to any interview. This is no more than would be good practice in the UK 
and we invite you provide an assurance in this regard.

Given the unfortunate history of this matter, already well documented, our view is that we cannot commit to a particular 
form of cooperation until we are properly informed and assured as to what protections, including as to confidentiality and 
use, are to pertain. Our ongoing concerns in this regard are only increased as a result of yesterday's leak to the world's

Thank you for your email. We are prepared to respond to your questions in full, but before proceeding further, we want to 
confirm that by "witness statement" you are referring to a live interview (to be conducted in person or via video 
conference), at which your client will answer our questions and, in advance of which, will produce any documents, 
including communications, relevant to the subjects to be covered at the interview.

Dear Ms Comey 
The UK Central Authority (UKCA) has informed us that the United States has formally sought assistance in 
interviewing our client. 
The UKCA told us that we would have the opportunity to contact Mr 
from the US Embassy to 
explore whether, notwithstanding our concerns at the unfair treatment of the Duke by the United States 
Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the failure by the DOJ to abide by its promise to provide an 
appropriate level of confidentiality to him and us, it would be possible for the Duke to reach an agreement with 
the DOJ and to provide a voluntary witness statement.

Unfortunately, it appears Mr 
has no authority in the matter and has directed us to contact the U.S. case 
team directly via your email address. With a view to progressing the request for assistance: 
[1] Please confirm that any communications between us, with a view to providing the DOJ with a voluntary 
witness statement from the Duke will be treated confidentially and in particular will not be the subject of DOJ 
press statements or commentary. 
[2] Please provide confirmation (given the reports of connections between the DOJ and US lawyers acting on 
no win/no fee arrangements) that any voluntary witness statement will not be used for any purpose other than 
the DOJ's criminal investigations. 
[3] We would be grateful if you would confirm the areas of testimony that you would wish the Duke's witness 
statement to cover.

Subject: DOJ ongoing Investigation. 
Date: Fri, 14 Feb 2020 17:00:13 +0000 
Inline-Images: image543915.jpg; image517195.jpg 
Dear IM 
We and the Duke of York set out to assist your investigation when the DOJ asked for his help in January 2020. 
However, we regret to say that we have reached the conclusion that the DOJ's dealings with the Duke of York 
have not been designed to seek his assistance in investigating and prosecuting the targets of the investigation but 
instead have been used only to gather publicity for Mr Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States Attorney for the 
Southern District of New York. 
It is essential, if justice is to be done for Epstein's victims, that a proper and thorough criminal investigation is 
carried out. Although the public record indicates your office (SDNY) has been actively investigating Mr. Epstein 
and other targets for more than 2 years, the first time you ever attempted to make contact and request The Duke 
of York's help was on 2 January 2020. 
The Duke instructed my firm to make contact with you pertaining to this request. When we made contact, you 
confirmed that the Duke of York was not and is not a target of the US criminal investigation. 
Due to the publicity surrounding the investigation, we asked you to confirm that our discussions and any 
interview arrangements would remain confidential, in accordance with your rules. The Duke did not want to add 
to the media circus that has now surrounded the investigation. On 10 January 2020 you confirmed that any 
arrangements would indeed be kept confidential. 
We indicated that we would refer back to you once we had dealt with the various issues and procedures, which 
would need to be addressed to enable the Duke to cooperate to the fullest extent possible, including the need to 
obtain all the information that you might need to consider. It was at that time that we informed you, by email 
dated 20 January, that such preliminary issues would be dealt with within 14 days. It was also in that email that 
we confirmed that The Duke has a strong desire to cooperate with the ongoing investigation by the DOJ. 
Instead of waiting to hear from us (as you indicated on 22 January 2020), Mr Geoffrey S. Berman, the United 
States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, chose to make a public statement about the Duke on 27 
January 2020. This led to press reports that there had been "a wall of silence" and that there had been "zero co-
operation" by the Duke. These statements were not true. They should not have been made. 
Quite apart from your promise of confidentiality, in England it would not be thought to be in the interests of 
justice for any prosecutor or investigator to make public statements about witnesses who may be willing, in 
confidence, to assist their investigation. 
In England, prosecutors and investigators try to make sure that the investigation and trial of serious criminal 
cases take place in court and not in press conferences or publicity battles. 
When we complained about the way the Duke (and we) had been treated by the DOJ, you refused to apologise 
and you have now also gone back on your promise that any arrangements for the interview will be confidential. 
EFTA00023802
--- PAGE 2 ---
We cannot advise the Duke to speak to prosecutors who cannot be trusted to deal with him fairly nor to treat 
what he says or does confidentially. He has reluctantly accepted our advice that, in those circumstances, there is 
no purpose to be served in continuing to try to assist further. 
Finally we have no wish to engage in any further publicity battle about the DOJ's conduct and for that reason we 
ask that you treat this email as private and confidential.

You are aware of our position, and we do not believe any further rehashing of our prior conversations is productive at 
this point. That said, we can confirm that it is our standard practice to refrain from publicly commenting on the 
substance of any witness interview, and we intend to abide by that practice in this case. Beyond that, we can make no 
commitments. Please advise as to whether Prince Andrew will agree to be interviewed and, if so, when such interview 
will take place.

Dear 
I
M
Thank you for your email of 30 January 2020. 
On 10 January 2020 you personally assured me that any contact between the Duke of York and the DOJ was 
confidential and would remain confidential within the investigation team in the DOJ and FBI. You said: "We don't 
intend to share either the contents or the existence of the conversation beyond our chain of command in the 
DOJ. As well as our partners at the FBI. It is confidential within the investigation team and our supervisors." The 
note I made of what you said about the confidentiality of the interview process is as follows: "We do not 
publicise the content or existence of any of our interviews. We can't guarantee that anyone might not share it 
with some other person or it might be shared with other individuals who might come to have knowledge of its 
existence, but our office does not advise the press of the interview and doesn't advise other interviewees of the 
fact the interview has taken place or the contents of those discussions. For example, it was reported widely that 
our office was attempting to interview your client months ago which was inaccurate. We have been working on 
this request for several weeks now and it has not hit the press. That is consistent with our processes. We take 
confidentiality very seriously." 
At no point did you suggest that, because of a press statement made on behalf of the Duke in November 2019, 
you or your colleagues in the investigation team would feel able to provide a public commentary on the DOJ's 
views on the degree of cooperation provided by the Duke. DOJ's first contact of any kind with the Duke was in 
early January 2020, and the first mention of any request for consideration of an interview came solely from you. 
I object to your wholly inaccurate statement that the Duke has created a public misimpression. The Duke has 
made it clear that he has a strong desire to cooperate fully with the ongoing investigation by the DOJ. The 
communications between us were intended to enable him to provide that co-operation. In order for this process 
to continue, I need to emphasise that we regard the confidential treatment of all contacts between the DOJ and 
the Duke as essential. We do not wish to have any public pronouncements on what we regard as a voluntary and 
confidential process. Please confirm that any further communications in connection with the requested 
voluntary interview will be treated as wholly confidential and the DOJ will offer no further commentary on the 
Duke's co-operation.

Gary, 
On November 20, 2019, Prince Andrew publicly offered to cooperate with our investigation into Jeffrey Epstein's 
crimes, stating in a press release: "Of course, I am willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their 
investigations, if required." In early January 2020, our Office responded to the Prince's public offer by contacting you to 
set up the interview that the Prince claimed to be willing give us. More than three weeks after our initial contact with 
you, we still had no date for an interview, nor did we even have a commitment from you that the Prince in fact would 
agree to an interview. 
On January 27, 2020, at a press event held by Safe Horizon to which Mr. Berman was invited, Mr. Berman was asked: 
"As part of [the Epstein) investigation have you reached out to interview Prince Andrew, and has he been 
cooperative?" 
Mr. Berman responded: "Ordinarily, our office doesn't comment on whether an individual cooperates or doesn't 
cooperate with our investigation. However, in Prince Andrew's case, he publicly offered, indeed in a press release, 
offered to cooperate with law enforcement investigating the crimes committed by Jeffrey Epstein and his 
coconspirators. So I think in that context, it's fair for people to know whether Prince Andrew has followed through with 
that public commitment. So let me say that the Southern District of New York and the FBI have contacted Prince 
Andrew's attorneys and requested to interview Prince Andrew and to date, Prince Andrew has provided zero 
cooperation." 
Mr. Berman's statement corrected a public misimpression — created by the Prince himself — that the Prince is 
cooperating with our investigation. 
As soon as the Prince commits to a date for the interview that he so publicly offered to us more than two months ago, 
we would be prepared to announce that he has agreed to be interviewed.

Dear 
,
Thank you for your email response claiming that US Attorney Berman's statements were factually accurate 
and did not create a misleading impression. 
We only have access to edited video and newspaper reporting of what the US Attorney said. Those reports 
suggest the US Attorney described the position of the Duke of York and his advisors in misleading, 
condemnatory and prejudicial terms. US Attorney Berman is quoted as having stated there has been "zero 
co-operation". This is not an accurate statement of the position. The following are also false statements 
ascribed to Mr Berman and to the DOJ/FBI: "F.B.I. agents and federal prosecutors in New York ... reached out 
to his lawyers and asked to interview him. There was no response at all, according to three people familiar 
with the investigation." (New York Times 27.01.20) and "Geoffrey Berman, a US attorney, said federal 
prosecutors and the FBI had asked to interview Prince Andrew about the late paedophile billionaire, but hod 
been met with a wall of silence"(The Telegraph 28.01.20). 
Please provide us with an accurate record of the statements made by The US Attorney and/or the Dal/FBI 
including a transcript of any relevant questions and answers. 
EFTA00023806

We note from your email that you have not provided any response to our request that you confirm that the 
DOJ will not be making any further public statements about the Duke of York. We had understood from our 
conversations with you and from the rules governing media relations that DOJ personnel and the US 
Attorney would not comment on the nature or progress of any grand jury investigation and in particular 
would not comment on the willingness of any Subject to make a voluntary statement to the DOJ. We ask you 
to confirm that there will be no further public comment on any contact between the Duke of York and the 
DOJ.

Gary, 
Our understanding is that U.S. Attorney Berman made a factual statement in response to a specific question that 
suggested the Duke of York either would or was cooperating, and he responded that to date he has not in fact 
provided cooperation with our investigation. That is, he corrected the record generally in a factually accurate 
statement; I don't believe this would create a misleading impression. I appreciate that you have advised us that your 
client has a desire to cooperate, and we look forward to hearing from you when he has made a determination as to 
whether he is in fact willing to speak with us.

The press are reporting that Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York 
has disclosed what we understood were confidential communications between us and 
and 
It has also been suggested that Geoffrey S. Berman has stated that the Duke of York has not co-operated with the 
Southern District. As you know we have made it very clear that the Duke of York has a strong desire to cooperate 
with the ongoing investigation by the DOJ and we are trying to reach a position where we are able to advise him to 
do so. 
We are concerned about the misleading impression that has been created and the effect this has on our ability to 
advise the Duke to proceed with any voluntary co-operation. Please confirm that the DOJ will not be making any 
further public statements on this topic.

Thank you for your response. It would be useful for us if you were able to help us understand the nature of the 
issues and procedures with which you are dealing, particularly as it sounds like it will take at least a couple 
additional weeks to address even minor preliminary issues, which suggests likely additional subsequent time to 
handle further processes—and without a response to the question of whether he is willing to speak with us, 
separate from a general desire to cooperate. Our investigation is moving forward expeditiously and so we would 
be grateful for some understanding of the relevant issues (especially, though not exclusively, to the extent we 
may be able to assist in their resolution) and would be happy to speak via phone if a real-time conversation 
would be more conducive to that discussion.

Mr. Bloxsome, 
Thank you for your response and for confirming your representation. To respond to your question generally, 
in connection with our investigation of conduct relating to Jeffrey Epstein and certain of his associates, we 
wish to request a consensual, voluntary law enforcement interview with your client. Generally, we would 
expect to inquire about his relationship and communications with Jeffrey Epstein and his associates, as well 
as certain allegations that have arisen publicly and in our investigation to date. 
Although we recognize we separately have the ability to convey such a request through diplomatic and law 
enforcement channels, we understand we may also alternatively inquire directly with counsel, when an 
individual has legal representation. Given your representation, we are inquiring directly with counsel in the 
first instance. 
Certainly we can discuss our request in more detail, but we hope this will provide the information you were 
seeking as a threshold matter, and we look forward to being in touch.

Thank you for your response and for confirming your representation. To respond to your question generally, in 
connection with our investigation of conduct relating to Jeffrey Epstein and certain of his associates, we wish to 
request a consensual, voluntary law enforcement interview with your client. Generally, we would expect to inquire 
about his relationship and communications with Jeffrey Epstein and his associates, as well as certain allegations that 
have arisen publicly and in our investigation to date. 
Although we recognize we separately have the ability to convey such a request through diplomatic and law 
enforcement channels, we understand we may also alternatively inquire directly with counsel, when an individual has 
legal representation. Given your representation, we are inquiring directly with counsel in the first instance. 
Certainly we can discuss our request in more detail, but we hope this will provide the information you were seeking as 
a threshold matter, and we look forward to being in touch. 
Regards, 
Assistant U.S. Attorney 
Southern District of New York

Gary, 
A brief update to the below information — I should have included the specific jury instruction elements for 18 U.S.C. 
1001, subsection (2), which likely would be more applicable to a prosecution based on a proffer statement. Although the 
knowing and willful element in particular is identical, we nevertheless wanted to provide this to you as well. Pursuant to 
Sand, Modern Federal Jury Instructions, Instruction 36-9 (Elements of the Offense), those elements are: 
First, on or about the date specified, the defendant made a statement or representation; 
Second, that this statement or representation was material; 
Third, the statement or representation was false, fictitious or fraudulent; 
Fourth, the false, fictitious or fraudulent statement was made knowingly and willfully; and 
Fifth, the statement or representation was made in a matter within the jurisdiction of the government of the United 
States (or federal funds were involved).

Gary, 
We write to follow up on our conversation yesterday, to confirm certain aspects of our discussion and to provide certain 
information you requested. First, thank you for conveying your questions, and I hope our initial responses were of some 
use. To provide additional information that may be helpful, attached please find a blank proffer agreement, which is our 
standard form agreement for proffer interviews, as you requested. Please note that in addition to the provisions I briefly 
described on our call, there are also provisions that may not be relevant to your client. We nevertheless send the 
complete agreement for your review. 
Additionally, and also as requested, certain information relating to Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001, is 
provided below. 
In relevant part, that statute states the following: "Except as otherwise provided in this section, whoever, in any matter 
within the jurisdiction of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the Government of the United States, knowingly 
and willfully-(1) falsifies, conceals, or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact; (2) makes any materially 
false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation; or (3) makes or uses any false writing or document knowing 
the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry [is guilty of an offense]. The full 
language of the statute is also available here. 
Regarding the elements required to prove such an offense, pursuant to Sand, Modern Federal Jury Instructions, 
Instruction 36-3 (Elements of the Offense), a conviction for this offense require that the following elements each must 
be proven beyond a reasonable doubt: 
First, that on or about the date specified in the indictment, the defendant falsified (or concealed or covered up) a 
material fact; 
Second, that the fact falsified (or concealed or covered up) was material; 
Third, that defendant did so by trick, scheme or device; 
Fourth, that defendant acted knowingly and willfully; and 
; Jennifer Richardson < 
EFTA00023819
--- PAGE 4 ---
Fifth, that the falsification, concealment or coverup was with respect to a matter within the jurisdiction of the 
government of the United States (if applicable: or that federal funds were involved). 
You may note in particular the inclusion of the "knowingly and willfully" requirement, as we discussed. 
We also understand that you will send us, to the extent you believe it is relevant or helpful for our consideration, any 
particular provisions or protections contemplated under the MLAT process, and which of those, if any, you believe are 
relevant, or should be applicable, to a voluntary interview. 
We look forward to speaking with you again this coming Monday, August 3, at 4:00 p.m. (LDN time), and we further 
confirm, as discussed, that our Office is prepared to extend the Negotiation Period, referenced in our email of July 14, 
2020, for two weeks from our call yesterday, to August 10, 2020, under the terms previously mutually agreed upon.

That's obviously disappointing but not hugely surprising —she was on a warpath about us meeting with that client, who 
says she saw PA dancing in the club. Not an obvious federal crime! We also corresponded about this a little ago in the 
attached. 
However, searching back for this stuff also reminded me that we never heard back from them on CD8, so just sent a 
reminder email on that.

Joe, 
We just wanted to check in very briefly—we had been hopeful that we'd be able to circle back with you 
earlier, but our investigation is currently still ongoing, so at the very least we wanted to let you know that we 
continue to appreciate both your client's prior assistance and her willingness to assist in the future. Nothing 
in our investigation since we were last substantively in touch has changed our view of your client, and we 
hope to be able to be in touch with you in the coming weeks with an update. In the interim, we do continue 
to view her status as we've previously conveyed, and please let us know if any issues arise on your end. 
thank you,

might want to do a "cleanup" superseder to fix any statutory language in the indictment, or whether any issues are either 
harmless or can be resolved by not giving the indictment to the jury (or amending/redacting the version that goes back to 
cure any issues).

Hey 
As you may have seen, on Friday, Judge Nathan denied all of Maxwell's supplemental motions. (She also denied an ex 
parte motion for some Rule 17 subpoenas, so it seems like our earlier motion was effective.) 
Judge Nathan's order, however, says that we did not object to providing the defense with the identities of Maxwell's 
uncharged co-conspirators, and she presumes we intend to do so. 
We've drafted the attached letter explaining that we do not, in fact, intend to do so. For convenience, Judge Nathan's 
opinion is attached, and the relevant passage is footnote 1 on page 12.

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 317 Filed 08/13/21 Page 1 of 14 
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
United States of America, 
—v—
Ghislaine Maxwell, 
Defendant. 
USDC SDNY 
DOCUMENT 
ELECTRONICALLY PILED 
DOC N: 
DATE FILED:8/13/21 
20-cr-330 (AJN) 
OPINION & ORDER 
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
On April 16, 2021, the Court issued an Opinion & Order granting in part and denying in 
part Ghislaine Maxwell's various pretrial motions seeking to dismiss portions of the 
Government's (S1) superseding indictment and compel discovery. Prior to the issuance of that 
Opinion & Order but after the motions were fully briefed, a grand jury returned a second (S2) 
superseding indictment adding a sex trafficking count and sex trafficking conspiracy count. The 
Court did not address the new charges in the April 16, 2021 Opinion & Order. On May 25, 
2021, Maxwell filed another round of pretrial motions seeking to dismiss the S2 indictment in 
whole or in part and to compel discovery. Dkt. No. 292, 293. For appeal preservation purposes 
or otherwise, the arguments largely, though not entirely, rehash the positions rejected by the 
Court in its April 16, 2021 Opinion & Order. To the extent new arguments are made, they are 
addressed below. All pending motions are DENIED. The Court provides a brief summary of its 
conclusions here and its reasoning on the pages that follow: 
• 
Maxwell moves to dismiss counts one, three, five, and six as barred by Jeffrey 
Epstein's non-prosecution agreement. The Court again concludes, as it did in its April 
16, 2021 Opinion & Order, that the agreement does not bind the United States Attorney 
for the Southern District of New York.

--- PAGE 2 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 317 Filed 08/13/21 Page 2 of 14 
• 
Maxwell moves to dismiss counts five and six on the grounds that prosecuting her on 
those counts would violate her rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause. The Court 
concludes that Maxwell has not previously been put in jeopardy for these offenses and 
therefore her prosecution on these counts does not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause. 
• 
Maxwell moves to dismiss counts five and six as untimely. The Court again concludes, 
as it did in its April 16, 2021 Opinion & Order, that the Government brought the 
charges within the applicable statute of limitations. 
• 
Maxwell moves to dismiss count five and either count one or count three as 
multiplicitous. The Court again determines, as it did in its April 16, 2021 Opinion & 
Order, that this motion is premature and denies it without prejudice for renewal at trial. 
• 
Maxwell moves to dismiss the S2 indictment for pre-indictment delay. The Court again 
concludes, as it did in its April 16, 2021 Opinion & Order, that Maxwell has not 
established that she suffered prejudice and therefore any delay has not violated her 
rights to due process. 
• 
Maxwell moves for a bill of particulars related to counts five and six because they are 
too vague, and in particular do not provide specific dates. The Court again concludes, 
as it did in its April 16, 2021 Opinion & Order, that the charges are sufficiently 
specific. 
• 
Maxwell moves to compel the Government to produce the statements of "Minor-Victim 
4" in the S2 indictment as Brady material. The Court concludes that the current 
disclosure schedule gives Maxwell sufficient time to make effective use of any such 
statements and therefore immediate disclosure is not warranted. 
I. 
Jeffrey Epstein's non-prosecution agreement does not bar the charges in the S2 
indictment 
In its April 16, 2021 Opinion & Order on Maxwell's first set of pretrial motions, the 
Court held that the non-prosecution agreement ("NPA") between Jeffrey Epstein and the U.S. 
Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida did not bar the charges against Maxwell in 
the S1 superseding indictment. See United States v. Maxwell, No. 20-cr-330 (AJN), 2021 WL 
1518675, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 16, 2021). Maxwell now renews those arguments for the charges 
in the S2 superseding indictment. The Court understands the primary purpose of Maxwell's 
renewed motion to be to preserve these arguments for appellate review, and the Court denies the 
EFTA00023896
--- PAGE 3 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 317 Filed 08/13/21 Page 3 of 14 
renewed motion for substantially the same reasons set forth in its April 16 opinion. The Court 
will proceed to briefly explain why neither the new charges in the S2 superseding indictment nor 
the supplemental authority Maxwell cites change the Court's conclusion that the NPA does not 
bar the charges against her. 
As the Court explained in its April 16, 2021 Opinion & Order, the Second Circuit held in 
United States v. Annabi that "[a] plea agreement binds only the office of the United States 
Attorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the 
agreement contemplates a broader restriction." 771 F.2d 670, 672 (2d Cir. 1985) (per curiam). 
The Second Circuit's opinion in Annabi is clear, and that court has followed it steadfastly since. 
See, e.g., United States v. Gonzalez, 93 F. App'x 268, 270 (2d Cir. 2004); United States v. 
Brown, No. 99-1230(L), 2002 WL 34244994, at *2 (2d Cir. Apr. 26, 2002); United States v. 
Salameh, 152 F.3d 88, 120 (2d Cir. 1998) (per curiam); United States v. Rivera, 844 F.2d 916, 
923 (2d Cir. 1988). The Second Circuit has held that language nearly identical to that in 
Epstein's NPA is not enough to overcome the presumption in favor of single-district plea 
agreements. See Salameh, 152 F.3d at 120. Adhering to this binding authority, this Court thus 
concluded (and continues to conclude) that the NPA does not bind the U.S. Attorney's Office for 
the Southern District of New York. It thus provides Maxwell no defense in this case even if it 
would otherwise cover the conduct charged in the new counts in the S2 superseding indictment. 
Maxwell advances two new arguments for why the Court should depart from this 
reasoning—the first in her renewed motion and the second in a letter of supplemental authority. 
See Dkt. Nos. 293, 310. In her renewed motion, she contends that Annabi contains an exception 
for out-of-district prosecutions for charges that are "identical to the dismissed charges." And in 
the letter of supplemental authority, she contends that the opinion of the Pennsylvania Supreme 
EFTA00023897
--- PAGE 4 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 317 Filed 08/13/21 Page 4 of 14 
Court in Commonwealth v. Cosby, No. 39 MAP 2020, 2021 WL 2674380 (Pa. June 30, 2021), 
requires dismissal. Neither argument is persuasive. 
Annabi contains no exception for out-of-district prosecutions for charges that are 
"identical to the dismissed charges." In the language Maxwell cites from Annabi, the Second 
Circuit discussed (and rejected) a claim based on the Double Jeopardy Clause, not a claim based 
on the plea agreement in that case. See Annabi, 771 F.2d at 672. In that section of the opinion, 
the Second Circuit held that even if the charges had been identical to the dismissed charges, the 
defendants' double jeopardy claims would fail because they were never in jeopardy on the 
charges that were dismissed under the plea agreement. Nothing in Annabi suggests that the 
presumption in favor of single-district plea agreements does not apply if later charges in another 
district are sufficiently "identical" to the dismissed ones, and no subsequent Second Circuit case 
applying Annabi has so held. Annabi applies squarely to the facts of this case and binds this 
Court. 
The Court also disagrees that Cosby mandates a different result. To begin with, this 
Court must follow the precedential opinions of the Second Circuit on questions of federal law, 
not those of a state court. Thus, nothing in Cosby could change this Court's view that Second 
Circuit precedent in Annabi forecloses Maxwell's arguments related to the NPA. In any event, 
the state court in Cosby did not purport to decide the same federal question at issue here. In 
Cosby, the court held that it was unfair for a district attorney to proceed with charges against Bill 
Cosby after the district attorney's office had, in that court's view of the facts, unequivocally 
promised that it would not charge him. Cosby, 2021 WL 2674380, at *34. That case did not 
involve a question of whether one office's promise bound another, much less whether a plea 
agreement in one federal district should be construed to apply in another district. Instead, the 
EFTA00023898
--- PAGE 5 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 317 Filed 08/13/21 Page 5 of 14 
case focused on whether prosecutors were required to honor a promise that the court found to be 
clear in the absence of a formal plea agreement. Even if this Court agreed with the analysis in 
Cosby, that opinion sheds no light on the proper interpretation of the NPA in this case. 
After considering the arguments in Maxwell's renewed motion and letter of supplemental 
authority, the Court's view remains unchanged from its April 16, 2021 Opinion & Order. Under 
Second Circuit precedent, the NPA does not bind the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of 
New York. It thus does not bar the charges in the S2 superseding indictment. 
II. 
This prosecution does not violate the prohibition against double jeopardy 
The Double Jeopardy Clause provides that "[n]o person shall be ... subject for the same 
offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb." U.S. Const. amend. V. "This protection 
applies both to successive punishments and to successive prosecutions for the same criminal 
offense." United States v. Dixon, 509 U.S. 688, 696 (1993). "A defendant may only raise a 
Double Jeopardy claim if he has been put in jeopardy (i.e. jeopardy has `attached') sometime 
before the alleged `second' prosecution." United States v. Podde, 105 F.3d 813, 816 (2d Cir. 
1997). A defendant is put in jeopardy when the jury in their case is empaneled or upon the 
defendant's entry of a guilty plea. Crist v. Bretz, 437 U.S. 28, 35 (1978); Morris v. Reynolds, 
264 F.3d 38, 49 (2d Cir. 2001). Until then, a defendant has not been put in jeopardy and the 
Government is free to commence a prosecution. 
Maxwell has not previously been put in jeopardy for the offenses charged in this case. 
She concededly has not been punished or prosecuted for any prior offense. She was never 
charged in the Southern District of Florida in connection with the Epstein investigation. She 
agreed to nothing in Epstein's NPA, because she was not a party to it. She suffered no criminal 
consequences as a result of Epstein's guilty plea in Florida state court. To the contrary, there is 
EFTA00023899
--- PAGE 6 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 317 Filed 08/13/21 Page 6 of 14 
no indication that Maxwell was even a subject of the Florida investigation. The Double Jeopardy 
Clause bars only successive prosecution or punishment for the same offense, and Maxwell has 
endured neither. Thus, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar the charges against her. 
Despite facing no prior prosecution or punishment herself, Maxwell contends that she is 
immune from prosecution because Epstein was already punished for the same conspiracy. The 
cases she cites, however, deal with successive prosecutions of a particular defendant for the same 
conspiracy, not separate prosecutions of individual co-conspirators. See, e.g., United States v. 
Lopez, 356 F.3d 463, 469 (2d Cir. 2004). The Double Jeopardy Clause does not require all co-
conspirators be tried together for related offenses. See Zafiro v. United States, 506 U.S. 534, 539 
(1993); United States v. Hinton, 543 F.2d 1002, 1014 (2d Cir. 1976). Whether the Government 
could have charged Epstein again in this case has nothing to do with Maxwell's rights under the 
Double Jeopardy Clause. 
Maxwell finally points to one case in which the Second Circuit held that a subsequent 
prosecution might not be permissible against a defendant whose charges were dismissed after her 
husband pleaded guilty. Dkt. No. 293 at 19 (citing United States v. Cambindo Valencia, 609 
F.2d 603 (2d Cir. 1979)). However, the Court agrees with the Government that the result in 
Cambindo Valencia rested on the terms of the husband's plea agreement, not the Double 
Jeopardy Clause. See Cambindo Valencia, 609 F.2d at 638. No precedent stands for the 
proposition that an uncharged co-conspirator is put in jeopardy when another co-conspirator 
accepts a non-prosecution agreement. This is the first case in which Maxwell will be put in 
jeopardy for these offenses, and so this prosecution does not put her in jeopardy a second time.

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 317 Filed 08/13/21 Page 7 of 14 
Counts five and six are not time-barred 
For most non-capital offenses, the statute of limitations under federal law is five years. 
U.S.C. § 3282(a). Congress has enacted longer limitations periods for certain crimes, in 
particular for "offense[s] involving the sexual or physical abuse, or kidnapping" of a minor in 18 
U.S.C. § 3283. Prior to 2003, the limitations period in § 3283 lasted until the victim reached the 
age of 25, and then Congress extended the limitations period to the life of the victim with the 
PROTECT Act of 2003, Pub. L. No. 108-21, 117 Stat 60. In 2006, Congress enacted 18 U.S.C. 
§ 3299, which eliminated the statute of limitations for the sex trafficking of minors in violation 
of 18 U.S.C. § 1591 and for some other sex crimes. See 18 U.S.C. § 3299 ("Notwithstanding 
any other law, an indictment may be found or an information instituted at any time without 
limitation for any offense under ... section 1591."). 
In her previous motion, Maxwell argued that the Mann Act charges against her in the 
indictment were time-barred on the grounds that the extended limitations period § 3283 was not 
applicable. The Court denied that motion in its April 16, 2021 Opinion & Order. Maxwell, 2021 
WL 1518675, at *5. Maxwell now argues that the new charges the Government has brought 
against her in the S2 indictment, Sex Trafficking Conspiracy (18 U.S.C. § 371) and Sex 
Trafficking (18 U.S.C. § 1591), are time-barred as well because § 3283 does not apply to those 
offenses either. She renews her contention from her previous motion that the limitations period 
in § 3283 only applies to offenses which "necessarily entail" the sexual abuse of a minor and 
argues that a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591 does not. Thus, according to Maxwell's reasoning, 
the general five-year statute of limitations period in 18 U.S.C. § 3282(a) applies to the sex 
trafficking counts and, because the alleged conduct occurred from 2001 to 2004, the Government 
is now time-barred for prosecuting her for these offenses. 
EFTA00023901
--- PAGE 8 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 317 Filed 08/13/21 Page 8 of 14 
The Court denies this motion for substantially similar reasons as those discussed in its 
April 16, 2021 Opinion & Order. As an initial matter, the Court reiterates that Maxwell's 
analysis of § 3283 is incorrect. As the Court explained, § 3283 does not call for a 
"categorical approach" nor an "essential ingredient" test, but instead requires that the defendant's 
conduct in that particular case involved the sexual abuse of a minor. Maxwell, 2021 WL 
1518675 at *5-7. Here, there is no question that Maxwell is alleged to have engaged in activity 
that constitutes the sexual abuse of a minor with respect to the sex trafficking counts. 
But in any event, as the Government pointed out in its brief — and as Maxwell did not 
contest in her reply — § 3283 is not the only statute of limitations that applies to the sex 
trafficking counts. As discussed above, in 2006, Congress enacted § 3299 to eliminate altogether 
the limitations period for the offense of sex trafficking children in violation of § 1591. See 18 
U.S.C. § 3299. 
Moreover, while the alleged sex trafficking in the S2 indictment is alleged to have 
occurred prior to the enactment of § 3299 in 2006, the Court holds that the provision nonetheless 
applies retroactively to cover that conduct. In its April 16, 2021 Opinion & Order, the Court 
analyzed § 3283 under the Landgraf v. USA Film Products, 511 U.S. 244, 280 (1994) framework 
and concluded that the limitations period applied retroactively so long as the previous limitations 
period had not yet expired. Maxwell, 2021 WL 1518675, at *7-8. Similar to § 3283, which 
states that "[n]o statute of limitations that would otherwise preclude prosecution" shall apply, the 
language of § 3299 provides that an indictment may be instituted at any time for certain offenses 
"[n]otwithstanding any other law." As discussed in the Court's previous opinion with respect 
to § 3283, this kind of language unambiguously requires that the limitations period apply 
retroactively to prosecutions for offenses committed before the date of enactment so long as the 
EFTA00023902
--- PAGE 9 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 317 Filed 08/13/21 Page 9 of 14 
applicable limitations period has not yet run — offenses that by definition are those for which 
"other law[sj" of limitation would otherwise bar prosecution. See 18 U.S.C. § 3299. Moreover, 
as the Court also explained, not only does this kind of language unambiguously require 
retroactivity, it also does not result in any impermissible retroactive effects so long as it does not 
revive time-barred claims. Maxwell, 2021 WL 1518675, at *7a The Court therefore joins 
multiple other district courts in concluding that, like § 3283, § 3299 applies retroactively to 
offenses for which the previous limitations period has not yet run. See United States v. Nader, 
425 F. Supp. 3d 619, 629 (ED. Va. 2019); United States v. Pierre-Louis, No. 16 CR 541 (CM), 
2018 WL 4043140, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2018); United States v. Vickers, No. 13-CR-128-A, 
2014 WL 1838255, at *8 (W.D.N.Y. May 8, 2014); United States v. Sensi, No. 3:08-CR-253 
(WWE), 2010 WL 2351484, at *3 (D. Conn. June 7, 2010). 
The sex trafficking charges are therefore not time-barred. Regardless of whether it was 
the general five-year limitations period in § 3282(a) or the extended limitations period for sexual 
abuse of minors in § 3283 that was applicable to Maxwell's alleged conduct prior to the 
enactment of § 3299 in 2006, neither had expired by that date. Thus, as Maxwell does not 
contest, § 3299 applies retroactively to the sex trafficking offenses in the indictment and the 
Government is permitted to bring those charges without time limitation. 
IV. 
Maxwell's motion to dismiss count five and either count one or count three as 
multiplicitous is premature 
In her previous motions, Maxwell argued that either count one or count three of the SI 
indictment, the Mann Act conspiracy charges, must be dismissed because the counts are 
multiplicitous. In the Court's April 16, 2021 Opinion & Order, the Court joined many other 
courts in this Circuit holding that pretrial motions of this sort are premature in light of United 
States v. Josephberg, 459 F.3d 350, 355 (2d Cir. 2006), and the Court dismissed without 
EFTA00023903
--- PAGE 10 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 317 Filed 08/13/21 Page 10 of 14 
prejudice. Maxwell, 2021 WL 1518675, at *14. In the instant motion, Maxwell similarly argues 
that count five of the S2 indictment, the sex trafficking conspiracy charge, is duplicative of either 
counts one or three. Maxwell's motion is denied without prejudice for the reasons stated in the 
Court's April 16, 2021 Opinion & Order. 
V. 
The Government's delay in bringing the charges did not violate due process 
Maxwell also renews her motion to dismiss the S2 indictment based on alleged improper 
pretrial delay. In its April 16, 2021 Opinion & Order, the Court denied Maxwell's motion, 
concluding that her efforts to show actual and substantial prejudice fell far short of the "stringent 
standard" necessary to prevail on such a claim. Maxwell, 2021 WL 1518675, at *9. Maxwell's 
motion to dismiss the S2 on these grounds fails for the same reasons. As before, nothing in the 
record indicates that the Government's delay in bringing these charges was designed to thwart 
Maxwell's ability to prepare a defense. However, it is sufficient to conclude that Maxwell does 
not make the strong showing of prejudice required to support this sort of claim. Maxwell 
contends that the Government's delay in bringing charges has prejudiced her interests because 
potential witnesses have died, others have forgotten, and records have been lost or destroyed. It 
is highly speculative that any of these factors would make a substantial difference in her case. 
The Court thus again concludes for the reasons stated in the April 16, 2021 Opinion & 
Order, that Maxwell has failed to establish actual prejudice from the Government's delay in 
bringing charges. She may renew her motion if the factual record at trial shows otherwise. On 
the present record, neither the applicable statute of limitations nor due process bars the charges 
here. 
EFTA00023904

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 317 Filed 08/13/21 Page 11 of 14 
VI. 
No bill of particulars is warranted 
Maxwell moves for a bill of particulars as to counts five and six. Federal Rule of 
Criminal Procedure 7 requires that an indictment contain "a plain, concise, and definite written 
statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged[.]" The indictment must be 
specific enough to inform the defendant of the charges and allow the defendant to plead double 
jeopardy in a later prosecution based on the same events. See United States v. Stavroulakis, 952 
F.2d 686, 693 (2d Cir. 1992). "Under this test, an indictment need do little more than to track the 
language of the statute charged and state the time and place (in approximate terms) of the alleged 
crime." United States. v. Tranzunti, 513 F.2d 1087, 1113 (2d Cir. 1975). 
"Rule 7(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure permits a defendant to seek a bill 
of particulars in order to identify with sufficient particularity the nature of the charge pending 
against him, thereby enabling defendant to prepare for trial, to prevent surprise, and to interpose 
a plea of double jeopardy should he be prosecuted a second time for the same offense." United 
States v. Bortnovsky, 820 F.2d 572, 574 (2d Cir. 1987). "The purpose of a bill of particulars is to 
supplement the allegations in the indictment when necessary to (1) enable the defendant to 
prepare his defense, (2) avoid unfair surprise to the defendant at trial, and (3) preclude a second 
prosecution of the same offense." United States v. Mandell, 710 F. Supp. 2d 368, 384 (S.D.N.Y. 
2010)). On the other hand, the Court must balance these interests against the harm to the 
Government from restricting its proof at trial. See United States v. Rajaratnam, No. 09-cr-1184 
(RJH), 2010 WL 2788168, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Jul. 13, 2010). 
In her previous motions, Maxwell argued that the Mann Act counts in the indictment 
should be dismissed for lack of specificity or that, in the alternative, the Court should compel the 
Government to submit a bill of particulars providing greater detail of the charges. Maxwell 
II 
EFTA00023905
--- PAGE 12 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 317 Filed 08/13/21 Page 12 of 14 
contended specifically that the indictment is too vague because it refers to open-ended time 
periods for the Mann Act counts. The Court disagreed in light of Circuit precedent requiring 
only that an indictment describe the time and place of the charged conduct in "approximate 
terms" and permitting the use of "on or about" language to describe the window of when a 
violation occurred. Maxwell, 2021 WL 1518675, at *10 (citing Tramunti, 513 F.2d at 1113; 
United States v. Nersesian, 824 F.2d 1294, 1323 (2d Cir. 1987)). The Court explained that 
approximate time periods are particularly appropriate if the allegations involved ongoing conduct 
and especially if the indictment alleges sexual abuse against minor victims. Id. (citing United 
States v. Young, No. 08-cr-285 (KMK), 2008 WL 4178190, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 4, 2008)). 
Maxwell now again moves for a bill of particulars. Maxwell primarily argues that the S2 
indictment does not provide specific dates for the conduct alleged with respect to the sex 
trafficking counts. Instead, the S2 indictment provides a four-year time period from 2001 to 
2004 in which the alleged sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy occurred. Maxwell's 
motion in this respect is denied for the same reasons stated in the Court's April 16, 2021 Opinion 
& Order. The indictment alleges ongoing conduct that involve the sexual abuse of minors with 
respect to counts five and six and therefore the approximate time period provided is sufficient. 
Accordingly, the motion for a bill of particulars is denied.' 
VII. 
The current disclosure schedule for impeachment material is adequate 
Finally, Maxwell moves to compel the immediate disclosure of any of Minor Victim's 
prior statements in which she did not mention Maxwell, including prior statements made to the 
' Additionally, Maxwell includes in her motion for a bill of particulars a request to require the 
government to identify the unnamed co-conspirators who allegedly participated in the conspiracies 
charged in the S2 indictment. Maxwell also made this request in the parties' joint May 21, 2021 letter to 
the Court regarding the disclosure schedule. Dkt. No. 291. In both her motion and the May 21, 2021 
letter, Maxwell requests that this information be disclosed to the defense at the same time that the 
Government discloses Jencks Act material. The Government has not opposed this request. In the absence 
EFTA00023906
--- PAGE 13 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 317 Filed 08/13/21 Page 13 of 14 
FBI. The Court has ordered the Government to disclose all Jencks Act and Giglio material by 
October 11, 2021. Dkt. No. 297 at 1. That date is seven weeks in advance of trial. The Court 
sees no reason to depart from the rule in this district that impeachment material of anticipated 
witnesses does not warrant an order compelling immediate disclosure. See United States v. 
Campo Flores, No. 15 Cr. 765 (PAC), 2016 WL 5946472, at *II (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 12, 2016). 
Seven weeks in advance of trial is far more time than is standard in this district and no showing 
has been made that it will be insufficient for Maxwell to make effective use of the information in 
preparation of her defense. 
To the extent Maxwell argues that the Government is in possession of prior statements 
that are exculpatory under Brady (for example, if a witness denied Maxwell's involvement), 
rather than useful only for standard impeachment purposes, it is of course the Government's 
obligation to "disclose such information to the defense promptly after its existence becomes 
known to the Government so that the defense may make effective use of the information in the 
preparation of its case." Dkt. 68 at 1. The context of questions and answers surely matters as to 
whether a statement (or omission) is exculpatory, impeaching, or neither. It is for the 
Government to make these assessments ex ante and fully meet its disclosure obligations so that 
the defense may make effective use of any such information in preparation for trial. See United 
States v. Coppa, 267 F.3d 132, 144-46 (2d Cir. 2001). The Government has repeatedly 
confirmed that it understands those obligations, and that it has met them and will continue to 
meet them. Accordingly, the motion to compel the immediate disclosure of any of Minor 
Victim-4's prior statements in which she did not mention Maxwell is denied. 
of objection, the Court presumes the Government intends to disclose this information to Maxwell at the 
same time that as it discloses Jencks Act material.

Re: 
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) 
We write in response to your letter of December 28, 2020, in which you request a bill of 
particulars in the above-captioned matter. As set forth herein, the Government does not intend to 
provide further particulars because under the well-established law of this Circuit it has no 
obligation to do so. To the contrary, and as you are aware, the Government outlined its charges 
against your client in a detailed speaking superseding indictment (the "Indictment") and has since 
provided considerable additional information through the production of to date of over 2.7 million 
items of discovery, all in electronic form and accompanied by an index. Accordingly, the 
Government has more than provided the defendant with adequate notice of the charges against her, 
and no further particulars are required. 
"A bill of particulars is required only where the charges of the indictment are so general 
that they do not advise the defendant of the specific acts of which he is accused." United States v. 
Walsh, 194 F.3d 37, 47 (2d Cir. 1999) (quotations marks and citation omitted); see also, e.g., 
United States v. Mahabub, No. 13 Cr. 908 (MN), 2014 WL 4243657, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 26, 
2014) (same); United States v. Mandell, 710 F. Supp. 2d 368, 384 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (same). 
"Acquisition of evidentiary details is not the function of the bill of particulars." United States v. 
Toms, 901 F.2d 205, 234 (2d Cir. 1990), abrogated on other grounds by United States v. Marcus, 
628 F.3d 36, 41 (2d Cir. 2010) (quotations marks and citation omitted). 
EFTA00023910
--- PAGE 2 ---
Nor may a bill of particulars be used as a general investigative tool. "It is not enough that 
the information would be useful to the defendant; if the defendant has been given adequate notice 
of the charges against him, the government is not required to disclose additional details about its 
case." United States v. Payden, 613 F. Supp. 800, 816 (S.D.N.Y. 1985); see also, e.g., United 
States v. Sindone, No. 01 Cr. 517 (MBM), 2002 WL 48604, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 14, 2002) (a 
defendant may not "use a bill of particulars to preview the government's evidence or trial strategy, 
or to require the government to specify the minutiae of how it will prove the charges. The stakes 
in a criminal case are high, and temptations of perjury, subornation and intimidation are ever 
present. Accordingly, the government is not required to turn over information that will permit a 
defendant to preview the government's case and tempt him to tailor proof to explain it away, or 
see to it that the government's proof is not presented." (citations omitted)); United States v. 
Guerrerio, 670 F. Supp. 1215, 1225 (S.D.N.Y. 1987) (A bill of particulars "is not a discovery tool 
and is not intended to allow defendants a preview of the evidence or the theory of the government's 
case."). 
A bill of particulars is unwarranted in this case because the Government has more than 
satisfied its obligations to provide the defense with sufficient information to "prepare for trial, to 
prevent surprise, and to interpose a plea of double jeopardy should [the defendant] be prosecuted 
a second time for the same offense." United States v. Bortnovsky, 820 F.2d 572, 574 (2d Cir. 
1987). The Indictment contains a written statement of the essential facts constituting the offenses 
charged, and it describes the conduct of the defendant that the Government expects to prove at trial 
with respect to three particular victims. The Indictment itself contains a detailed description of the 
accounts these victims have provided law enforcement. In addition to the Indictment, which 
provides more than sufficient information about the charges against your client, you are also in 
possession of, among other things, numerous search warrant affidavits that outline evidence 
revealed during the Government's investigation over time (see, e.g., SDNY_GM_00000423- 
SDNY7  GM_ 00000524); documentary evidence, including travel records and contemporaneous 
journal entries that corroborate the victims' accounts; and the Government's letters concerning 
bail and detention. In sum, the Indictment and the materials produced during discovery provide 
you with more than ample information concerning the allegations that the Government intends to 
prove at trial and the supporting evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Reinhold, 994 F. Supp. 194, 
201 (S.D.N.Y. 1998) (denying request for bill of particulars where the "indictment is detailed in 
its allegations" and the "defendants have had extensive discovery"). 
To the extent that your requests seek information regarding potential witnesses and/or co-
conspirators or alders and abettors (Requests 1-20, 22-26), the Government is not required to 
provide such information at this time. See, e.g., United States v. D'Amico, 734 F. Supp. 2d 321, 
335 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) ("`A bill of particulars is not a general investigative tool, a discovery device 
or a means to compel the government to disclose evidence or witnesses to be offered prior to trial."' 
(quoting United States v. Gibson, 175 F. Supp. 2d 532, 537 (S.D.N.Y. 2001))); United States v. 
Barrera, 950 F. Supp. 2d 461, 478-79 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) (denying motion for bill of particulars as 
to identities of unnamed victims of alleged murder conspiracy); United States v. Castro, No. 08 
Cr. 268 (NRB), 2008 WL 5062724, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2008) ("An indictment need not 
identify all alleged co-conspirators, nor specify the nature, time and place of every overt act the 
defendant or others allegedly took in furtherance of a conspiracy, nor must it set forth all the 
evidence the government intends to introduce."); United States v. Sindone, 2002 WL 48604, at *1 
EFTA00023911
--- PAGE 3 ---
(denying request for bill of particulars that would identify alleged co-conspirators and victims); 
United States v. Trippe, 171 F. Supp. 2d 230, 240 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) ("[D]emands for particular 
information with respect to where, when, and with whom the Government will charge the 
defendant with conspiring are routinely denied."); United States v. Mitlof, 165 F. Supp. 2d 558, 
569 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) ("What defendant seeks is in the nature of the `wheres, whens and with 
whoms' that [c]ourts have held to be beyond the scope of a bill of particulars." (collecting cases)); 
United States v. &itchier, 104 F. Supp. 2d 289, 313 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (denying "Defendants' 
request for names of all aiders, abettors, unindicted co-conspirators, and confidential informants" 
as "nothing more than a request for a witness list"); see also Fed. R. Crim. P. 16. As previously 
stated, and as noted in the Government's letter dated October 28, 2020, with regard to your many 
requests for information that fall within the scope of the Government's Giglio and Jencks Act 
obligations, we intend to produce all such material in advance of trial and remain available to 
confer generally regarding a mutual schedule for pretrial and trial-related disclosures, including 
witness statements or Giglio material. 
You seek numerous, specific details which amount to requests for a detailed preview of the 
Government's case and its legal theories (Requests 7, 14, 19, 25, and 29). The Government is not 
required to disclose at this juncture the way in which it expects to prove the charges or the precise 
manner in which the defendant committed the charged crimes, nor must the Government provide 
a preview of the evidence or legal theories it intends to present at trial. See, e.g., United States v. 
Dupigny, 18 Cr. 528 (JMF), 2019 WL 2327697, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May 30, 2019) (denying motion 
for bill of particulars and explaining that the defendant "need not be informed of the specific means 
of coercion he is alleged to have employed against the still-unidentified victims in the Superseding 
Indictment. And between the indictment, applications for search warrants, court filings, and 
proffers during bail hearings, the Government has advised Dupigny of the nature and timeframe 
of the conspiracy; the number of victims involved in the substantive trafficking offenses, the ages 
of several of the victims, and the residence from which he recruited them; and the types of physical 
force and coercion he has employed against at least some of them"); United States v. Pierre-Louis, 
Cr. 541 (CM), 2018 WL 4043140, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2018) ("Defendant's demand that 
the Government provide him with the specifics of how it will prove the `interstate transportation' 
element of its case is an improper attempt to limit the Government's proof at trial and is the type 
of `when, where, and how' bill of particular requests that are `almost uniformly . . . denied.'" 
(citation omitted)); United States v. Monzon-Luna, No. 11 Cr. 722 (RRM), 2014 WL 223100, at 
*4 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 21, 2014) (denying request for bill of particulars where defendant was charged 
with, among other things, sex trafficking of minors and a Mann Act violation, and stating that the 
indictment "explains the essential facts constituting each of the crimes charge[d], the time frame 
in which the crime is alleged to have occurred, and the victim involved. This information is 
sufficient to apprise defendant of the charges against him."). For example, with respect to Requests 
7, 14, 19, and 25, the Government directs your attention to the Indictment, at paragraphs 11(b), 13, 
17(b), and 19, which refer to sex acts in violation of New York Penal Law, Section 130.55. With 
respect to Request 28, the Government refers you to the Indictment, at paragraph 7, which 
describes the conduct of the defendant that the Government expects to prove at trial with respect 
to three particular victims. Based on the foregoing, you are not entitled to the particulars sought 
through your requests, and in any event, much of what you seek is described in the Indictment and 
discovery. If you have authority for your requests, we would be happy to consider it.

I recall that at some point you requested a version of the Epstein FOIA documents from BOP without the translucent 
green watermark they put on the withheld documents. Do you have those saved down somewhere? Although the Court 
has not put in a specific order yet, I think it's likely that we'll need to produce documents without the translucent green

Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman charged with conspiring to violate straw and foreign donor bans: In 
October 2019, four defendants were charged in a four-count indictment alleging that each of 
the defendants conspired to violate the ban on foreign donations and contributions in 
connection with federal and state elections. In addition, Parnas and Fruman were charged with 
conspiring to make contributions in connection with federal elections in the names of others, 
and with making false statements to and falsifying records to obstruct the administration of a 
matter within the jurisdiction of the Federal Election Commission ("FEC"). 
Ghislaine Maxwell charged for conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein to sexually abuse minors: In July 
2020, Maxwell was arrested and charged with enticing a minor to travel to engage in criminal 
sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, 
conspiracy to commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn 
deposition. The Indictment unsealed today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 
through 1997, Maxwell and co-conspirator Jeffrey Epstein exploited girls as young as 14, 
including by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the purpose of engaging in illegal 
sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference for young girls, Maxwell played a 
critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations including 
New York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, Maxwell made several false 
statements in sworn depositions in 2016.

For whatever it's worth, this article seems to be almost entirely based on information from Spencer Kuvin, who has been 
an extremely frustrating and unhelpful presence during our case—he routinely has been quoted in media reports saying 
things that are completely wrong (and actively harmful to the investigation). As an example, he wasn't even at either of 
the meetings he's purporting to have information on here. Additionally, none of us on the team has literally ever spoken 
with him or met him, nor are we aware of any victim clients that he actually currently represents (despite his repeated 
claims that he actively represents victims), and we're also not aware of anyone who intends to meet with us who's a client 
of his. 
Obviously we have no control over him or anyone who uses him as a source, but he has put inaccurate information out a 
number of times (including that he has any clients who have spoken with us and/or intend to) so I figured it might be 
useful to let you know.

Federal Prosecutors Are Lining Up Witnesses 
Against Jeffrey Epstein's Cronies 
Numerous Epstein victims have met with prosecutors in recent days.

It's been more than two months since Jeffrey Epstein killed himself, but the 
investigation into possible accomplices is still very much alive. In recent days, federal 
prosecutors probing the financier's sex-trafficking ring have been asking Epstein 
victims if they could serve as witnesses in the criminal case they are building. 
Representatives from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New 
York traveled to Florida for an Oct. 15 meeting with several of Epstein's victims and 
their counsel. The staffers, who worked in the victim services unit, held a similar 
meeting in New York on Oct. 23, lawyers for the women and a law enforcement 
source told The Daily Beast. 
ADVERTISEMENT 
Two people familiar with the investigation said that prosecutors have heard from 
"dozens" of witnesses or victims since Epstein's arrest in July. 
Following Epstein's death in August, which was ruled a suicide by hanging, the 
Department of Justice said that it would continue to investigate anyone who helped 
Epstein procure underage girls or helped him to cover up crimes. A spokesman for 
the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's Office declined to comment on where the probe 
stands, only saying that the "investigation is continuing." 
EFTA00023921
--- PAGE 3 ---
Spencer Kuvin, a Palm Beach attorney who represents two women who were abused 
by Epstein, said the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York 
offered counseling services to the group of victims who gathered in Miramar, Florida. 
The representatives also worked to debunk conspiracy theories, which the victims 
have encountered online, related to Epstein's  jailhouse suicide. According to Kuvin, 
prosecutors continue to battle 
speculation on how the 66-year-old money-
manager died, along with rumors that he isn't dead at all. 
"The U.S. Attorney's Office wanted to put to rest some of those conspiracy theories—
that he was killed, that he's still alive. There are people still talking about that," 
Kuvin told The Daily Beast. "There are still people that think this was an absolute 
ruse and he's sitting pretty in another part of the world." 
Kuvin said investigators assured the women that their probe into Epstein's alleged 
co-conspirators was ongoing. The lawyer declined to comment on the identities of 
those suspected accomplices. 
ADVERTISING 
"They wanted to meet with some of the victims to discuss whether or not they could 
be potential witnesses in that ongoing investigation," Kuvin said. "One of my clients 
is going to meet with them privately about that issue." 
During the Florida meeting, coordinators for federal prosecutors answered questions 
from the women, some of whom felt burned over their treatment 12 years ago, when 
the U.S. Attorney's Office in Miami secretly negotiated a cushy plea deal for Epstein. 
Back then, the feds promised the women they'd prosecute the creepy 
multimillionaire; instead, they collaborated with his legal team to downgrade the 
charges. 
"The focus really is: What are you doing now and are you honestly going to pursue 
the co-conspirators or are those just words?" Kuvin said. 
EFTA00023922
--- PAGE 4 ---
"They've been wronged by the system numerous times," Kuvin added of his clients 
and other victims of Epstein, "from the late 2000S all the way up to him killing 
himself. Every time an official comes forward and says, `Don't worry. We're going to 
do the right thing,' they shake their heads and say, `We'll see.'" 
In New York last week, prosecutors met with victims at a federal building downtown 
where local FBI headquarters is housed to inform the women of their rights and offer 
counseling services. 
Duncan Levin, a former assistant U.S. Attorney and chief of asset forfeiture at the 
Manhattan District Attorney's office, said Epstein's inner circle shouldn't rest easy. 
"There is at least some evidence that other people facilitated his crimes, and there's 
obviously enough public interest in the case that [prosecutors] aren't going to drop it 
just because he's dead," said Levin, managing partner at Tucker Levin, PLLC. 
Levin said prosecutors are likely to thoroughly investigate Epstein's alleged enablers 
and seek forfeiture of Epstein's properties that were used to facilitate the sex crimes. 
A bare-bones rundown of Epstein's assets submitted by his lawyers following his 
arrest, and bank records obtained by prosecutors, provided a glimpse into Epstein's 
net worth which is estimated at more than $550 million, but it may not be a 
complete accounting. The listed assets included $56 million in cash and another 
$500 million in properties and investments. 
The properties include $85 million worth of real estate in the U.S. Virgin Islands—
including his own private island—an $8.6 million Paris apartment, a $12 million 
Palm Beach estate, a $17 million New Mexico ranch, and his Manhattan mansion—
EFTA00023923
--- PAGE 5 ---
which Epstein claimed is worth $55 million but prosecutors have said is worth $T7 
million. 
"Justice is a slow-moving train," Levin said. "This is par for the course. Investigations 
are measured in months and years not days and weeks." 
"I would be very nervous if I were somebody who helped Jeffrey Epstein at this point 
and would be seeking legal counsel," Levin added. 
Epstein was arrested on July_6 and charged with sex-trafficking and conspiracy to 
commit sex-trafficking. The indictment referred to three victims and three unnamed 
employees of Epstein who allegedly assisted in the sex pyramid scheme. 
According to the complaint, Epstein created a "network of minor victims in multiple 
states to sexually abuse and exploit" and "worked and conspired with others, 
including employees and associates who facilitated his conduct by, among other 
things, contacting victims and scheduling their sexual encounters with Epstein." 
From 2002 to 2005, the indictment states, Epstein "enticed and recruited" minor 
girls as young as 14 to visit his mansions and engage in sex acts with him, after which 
he or his assistants gave the victims hundreds of dollars in cash. 
It's unclear which alleged co-conspirators prosecutors are targeting. 
In one July court filing, prosecutors requested a protective order, indicating they 
planned to produce certain documents and materials that "would impede, if 
prematurely disclosed, the Government's ongoing investigation of uncharged 
individuals." 
In 2008, when Epstein pleaded guilty to state charges, his non-prosecution 
agreement with the feds granted immunity to his alleged accomplices, "including but 
not limited to

Attorneys for

One lawsuit, filed by a Jane Doe in September against Epstein's estate, describes

asked Doe to bring other girls with her," paying her every time she did so.

a former assistant to Epstein, is facing a lawsuit from-

complaint also targets Epstein's alleged madam, Ghislaine Maxwell—who's 
kept a low profile since the hedge-funder's arrest and has long  faced accusations of 
recruiting underage girls and taking part in sexual abuse herself. 
Another lawsuit, recently filed by Priscilla Doe, alleges that "in addition to providing 
sexual instruction, Ghislaine Maxwell further made sure that Plaintiff and the other 
EFTA00023925
--- PAGE 7 ---
young females were constantly on call to sexually service Jeffrey Epstein." 
Maxwell isn't the only Epstein friend under scrutiny in the press. Authorities in 
France are looking into sexual misconduct claims against talent scout Jean-Luc 
Brunel, accused in civil court filings of procuring young models for Epstein to 
exploit. 
"Jeffrey Epstein has told me that he has slept with over 1,000 of Brunel's girls, and 
everything that I have seen confirms this claim," said accuser 
in a 
2015 affidavit. 
says she was 16 when Maxwell recruited her into Epstein's 
trafficking ring. 
In response, Brunel issued a statement denying 
claims, saying he never 
participated "directly nor indirectly, in the actions Mr. Jeffrey Epstein is being 
accused of." 
Last year, Epstein may have attempted to buy the silence of alleged co-conspirators 
just as his name re-emerged in the press. 
Prosecutors say Epstein wired payments to two unnamed women—one received 
$250,000 while the other got $100,000—shortly after the Miami Herald's exposé on 
Epstein's 2007 sweetheart deal. Those individuals were listed as possible co-
conspirators in Epstein's non-prosecution agreement, the U.S. Attorney's Office said 
in July. 
At a bail hearing that month, Assistant U.S. Attorney 
told the court 
that "after seven days of this case being public following months of a covert 
investigation, the evidence is already significantly stronger and getting stronger 
every single day. 
EFTA00023926

"Many individuals identifying themselves as victims and witnesses have contacted 
the government," Rossmiller continued, "and we are in the process of receiving and 
corroborating this additional evidence." 
Brad Edwards, an attorney who sued the government on behalf of victims over 
Epstein's lenient plea deal, said, "I assume that if there are others that should be held 
accountable for crimes that can still be prosecuted, then they will." 
Edwards said he trusts that New York prosecutors "are trying to leave no stone 
unturned." 
Last month, U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra refused to scrap the non-prosecution 
agreement that shielded Epstein and his alleged co-conspirators from facing serious 
charges—despite Marra's ruling that the agreement was illegal. 
Marra also denied the victims' requests for other relief: attorneys' fees, a hearing 
where victims could speak, and the release of documents including grand jury 
materials. The decision was part of a 2008 lawsuit Jane Does 1 and 2 filed against the 
United States, alleging the feds violated the Crime Victims' Right Act. 
who has come forward as Jane Doe 1, has appealed to the U.S. Court 
of Appeals for the iith Circuit. Oral arguments are scheduled for January. 
"A ruling rescinding the immunity provisions would have permitted the victims to 
confer with government prosecutors about the possibility of obtaining prosecution of 
Epstein's co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida — i.e., would have 
afforded them their rights under the CVRA," 
appeal states.

Hi=, 
The FBI is aware of 1 or 2 victims who indicated they could not come on short notice, but does not recall which victims 
they were. There were other victims who decided not to come but cited other reasons, such as scheduling issues or 
aversion to press exposure. USAO is not aware of victims who raised scheduling issues. Of course, that doesn't mean 
they didn't have them, just that no one recalls anyone affirmatively raising them beyond the 1 or 2. 
I also now know that, including victims whose known counsel we contacted as opposed to directly, the number who were 
told about the hearing is at least 50, as opposed to 39. I am still working on whether this number of 50 includes all of the 
identified Florida victims. 
is the total number of victims who either spoke or provided written submissions.

Thank you for this information. It is very helpful but we need a little more clarity. Can you confirm with 
the VW coordinators (USAO and FBI), prosecutors, and agents whether any victims complained about not 
being able to participate in the SDNY hearing? Can you also confirm whether the 39 contacted victims 
include all of the identified Florida victims? In addition to the 17 victims that spoke directly or through 
counsel, did any victims submit letters to the court in their absence? 
Petitioner's counsel has alleged that DOJ, specifically SDNY, possesses information that some of the 
Epstein victims were unable to attend the SDNY hearing because they did not have sufficient notice to 
travel to NY. They believe this information is material to the subjects currently being litigated in the 11th
Circuit. We need to pin this information down so it can be addressed in the government's response which 
is due on 10/31. 
Again, we apologize for the fire drill but this issue was just raised within the last 48 hours. If you can 
provide this information before noon tomorrow it will be greatly appreciated.

Hi 
We reached out to at least 39 victims, either directly or through attorneys. The number could be higher, but that is the 
best as I can confirm today. 
At least 17 victims attended the hearing because that is the number that spoke, either directly or through counsel. We 
believe there may have been additional who were present but did not speak, based on what their attorneys said. 
We are not aware of victims who complained about not having an opportunity, but I'd be hesitant to make a categorical 
statement about that, as its possible I am missing something or the Bureau heard any complaints.

Importance: High 
The Petitioner in the Epstein CVRA case has filed an appeal to the 11th Circuit. One of their issues is the 
District Court's refusal to hold a hearing allowing the Epstein victims to "have their day in court." The 
Court's ruling is, in part, on the basis that a hearing held in SDNY satisfied this request. The Petitioner has 
alleged that not all of the Epstein victims who wanted to speak were able to do so at the New York hearing 
because they did not have sufficient notice and were unable to travel to NY. 
Can your office provide us some details about the following: 1) how many victims were contacted about 
making a victim impact statement; 2) how many victims were able to travel and make an in-person victim 
impact statement; and 3) how many victims indicated they wanted to make a victim impact statement but 
were unable to do so given the notice/timing of the hearing?

instance, putting dates in the right order or making sure that fonts and indentations are correct), some stylistic 
(e.g., the Combatting Corruption entries each begin with language akin to a headline while the others do not), 
and some more substantive (do we want to add or delete particular cases?). Also, the visuals that go with each 
subpage have not been completed. In some instances, that's because Nick has not located visuals that he thinks 
are usable or a good fit. In other places, he has identified visuals that he plans to add, but has yet to do so. That 
said, many of the subpages do have visuals. In order to view the visuals for any subpage, you hit the "Ctrl" key 
while clicking on the heading for the subpage — e.g., for Thwarting and Responding to Acts of Terror, you press 
on the "Ctrl" key and click on the heading Thwarting and Responding to Acts of Terror. I've also attached a link

Thwarting and Responding to Acts of Terror 
The Office addresses a full range of threats to national security, domestic and international 
terrorism, espionage, and large-scale international drug and arms trafficking. Working closely with 
the New York Joint Terrorism Task Force and other law enforcement partners, prosecutors assigned 
to the Office's Terrorism and International Narcotics Unit have obtained convictions in important 
national security matters: 
• In May 2019, the Terrorism and International Narcotics Unit convicted Ali Kourani at trial for his 
work as a covert operative for Hizballah's external attack-planning component. 
• In November 2018, the Terrorism and International Narcotics Unit charged Cesar Sayoc just days 
after he mailed sixteen packages containing explosives to CNN, Hillary Clinton, and other public 
figures in this District and across the country. In March 2019, $ayoc pled guilty to 65 felonies, 
including use of weapons of mass destruction and interstate mailing of explosives. In August 2019. 
Sayoc was sentenced to 20 years in prison. 
• In November 2018, the Terrorism and International Narcotics Unit convicted Akayed Ullah at trial 
for detonating a pipe bomb during rush hour in the Port Authority Bus Terminal in support of ISIS. 
• In February 2018, Ahmad Khan Rahimi, the so-called "Chelsea Bomber," was sentenced to multiple 
terms of life imprisonment following his trial conviction for his ISIS-inspired plot to detonate 
powerful explosives in that densely populated Manhattan neighborhood. 
• The Terrorism and International Narcotics Unit investigated and charged Paul Rosenfeld in October 
2018. Following his subsequent guilty plea, Rosenfeld has since been sentenced for offenses related 
to his construction of a destructive device in his Tappan, New York, basement that he intended to 
detonate on the National Mall on Election Day. 
Enforcing International Sanctions 
The Office is on the front lines of identifying and prosecuting individuals and entities that violate 
U.S. and international sanctions. 
• In May 2019, the Office announced the first-ever seizure of a North Korean cargo vessel for violating 
international sanctions. As detailed in the complaint, the "Wise Honest" was one of North Korea's 
largest carrier ships and was used to export coal from North Korea and import machinery in 
violation of U.S. and U.N. sanctions. The vessel was sold at auction on October 7, 2019. 
• In January 2018, the Terrorism and International Narcotics Unit secured the second of two 
convictions against participants in a sprawling scheme to illicitly transfer billions of dollars of 
Iranian oil money in violation of U.S. sanctions. In October 2019, the Office announced charges 
against a Turkish bank for its alleged role in facilitating the sanctions-evasion scheme.

Prosecuting Corrupt Public Officials 
The Office holds public officials accountable by investigating and prosecuting abuses of office, 
including quid pro quo bribery, embezzlement of public funds, civil rights violations, and other 
criminal offenses perpetrated by public officials, law enforcement officers and others. Recent 
prosecutions include: 
• Personal Attorney to the President Convicted of Campaign Finance Crimes, Tax Evasion and 
Fraud: In August 2018, the Public Corruption Unit secured the conviction of Michael Cohen, the 
former personal attorney to the President, upon a plea of guilty to a multi-count information. Of 
note, Cohen pleaded guilty to making unlawful, excessive contributions to the 2016 presidential 
campaign in the form of payments to two women to secure their silence regarding the then-
presidential candidate in order to prevent those stories from influencing the election. Cohen also 
pleaded guilty to multiple counts of tax evasion in connection with his concealment of millions of 
dollars in income from the IRS, and to making false statements to a financial institution. In 
December 2018, Cohen was sentenced to 36 months' imprisonment. 
• Nine Defendants, Including Joseph Percoco, Former Executive Deputy Secretary to the Governor, 
and Alain Kaloyeros, President Of SUNY Polytechnic Institute, Convicted of Federal Corruption and 
Fraud Offenses: In September 2016, the Public Corruption Unit unsealed charges against two high-
ranking State officials, businessmen, and a corrupt lobbyist relating to multiple significant criminal 
schemes affecting in the aggregate nearly $1 billion in State funds. In the first scheme, one of the 
most powerful individuals in New York State's executive department — Joseph Percoco, the 
Executive Deputy Secretary to the Governor — accepted bribe payments from a large energy company 
and a real estate development company for his influence and action on multiple significant State 
decisions. In the second scheme, Alain Kaloyeros, a public university president who was given vast 
control by the Governor's office over State economic development projects engaged in a bid-rigging 
scheme involving the Governor's centerpiece economic development initiative — known as the 
Buffalo Billion — conspiring with businessmen to rig the bidding process for State-funded projects 
worth hundreds of millions of dollars. After two trials, as well as guilty pleas, Percoco, Kaloyeros, 
five businessmen, and the lobbyist were convicted. 
• Four New York City Police Department Officers Convicted of Bribery in Connection with Approving 
Gun Licenses: Between 2017 and 2019, the Public Corruption Unit convicted four officers from the 
NYPD's License Division for accepting bribes to approve, upgrade and expedite gun licenses, 
including of individuals who would otherwise have been rejected on account of their criminal 
history. The bribes included cash, sometimes handed over in envelopes or stuffed between pages of a 
magazine, luxury travel, and other gifts. In addition to approving and expediting gun licenses, the 
bribed officers often upgraded gun licensees to have full concealed carry rights in New York City

without the proper justification. Those charge and convicted included Lieutenant Paul Dean, the 
former Executive Officer of the License Division. Also convicted were four former "expediters" who 
charged clients a fee to help them obtain gun licenses by bribing the officers, including a former 
Assistant District Attorney.

Assembly, following a two-week fury trial on charges of wire fraud. mail fraud, extortion under color 
of official right, and engaging in illegal monetary transactions all arising out Silver's improper use of 
his position. The evidence at trial showed that Silver used his office position to obtain nearly $4 
million in bribes in exchange for his official acts and another $1 million through laundering the 
proceeds of his crimes. Silver was sentenced to seven years in prison. 
• In July 2018, following a jury trial, the Public Corruption Unit obtained convictions of Dean Skelos 
the former New York State Senate Majority Leader, and his son. Adam Skelos, on charges of bribery 
and extortion. The proof at trial showed that Dean Skelos used his position to obtain more than 
$300,000 in bribes and extortion payments that were made to Adam Skelos. Dean Skelos received a 
sentence of 51-months imprisonment and Adam Skelos received a sentence of four years' 
imprisonment. 
Prosecuting Local Corruption 
• Christopher St. Lawrence. the former Ramapo Town Supervisor. engaged in a scheme to defraud 
investors in Rama o's municipal bonds lw manipulating the Town's financial statements to create 
the appearance that the Town was fiscally sound. He did so in order to obtain the financing he 
needed to build Palisades Credit Union Park, a 3,50o seat minor league baseball stadium in Ramapo, 
at a cost of more than $60 million. He was found guilty at trial and sentenced to 30 months in 
prison. St. Lawrence's conviction marked the first prosecution for accounting fraud in connection 
with municipal bonds. 
• 
Keith Borge, the former Controller for the College of New Rochelle, was convicted in 2019 of 
engaging in a 20 million dollar payroll tax fraud and securities fraud scheme. Borge failed to pay 
over to the IRS over 20 million dollars in payroll tax and covered up the resulting liability on the 
colleges financials. The college's bondholders were defrauded by the false financial statements. His 
scheme contributed to the college's bankruptcy and closure.

I Inman Trafficking and Sexual Exploitation of Minors 
The Office prioritizes the investigation and prosecution of numerous child pornography, child 
enticement, child endangerment, and sex trafficking offenses. 
• In July 2019, prosecutors charged Jeffrey Epstein with sex trafficking of minors between 2002 
through 2005, Epstein sexually exploited and abused dozens of underage girls by enticing them to 
engage in sex acts with him in exchange for money. Epstein allegedly worked with several employees 
and associates to ensure that he had a steady supply of minor victims to abuse, and paid several of 
those victims themselves to recruit other underage girls to engage in similar sex acts for money. The 
indictment against Jeffrey Epstein was vacated following his death in August of 2019. 
• Beginning from a tip about the trafficking of minor victims in and around the New York City area 
and a subsequent interview of one particular minor victim, the Office has successfully investigated 
and prosecuted violent pimps who trafficked adults and minors--some as young as 13 years-old—who 
were often part of the New York City social services system. The investigation has resulted in charges 
against 19 defendants in eight separate indictments; to date, 15 of the defendants have been 
convicted—two following jury trials and 13 by guilty pleas. The first defendant to be sentenced in 
this matter, who was convicted following a May 2019 jury trial, received a sentence of 17 years' 
incarceration, and the remaining convicted defendants face substantial sentences 
• In October 2018, the General Crimes Unit convicted Lavelleous Purcell after trial of five counts 
related to his forced prostitution of multiple adult women. Purcell was sentenced to 188 months' 
imprisonment. 
• In December 2018, Clint Edwards was sentenced to 20 years in prison for arranging to meet a 14-
year old child over social media and filming himself having sex with the victim in the basement of the 
victim's apartment building. 
• In 2018, the White Plains Division secured a 32-year prison sentence for David Ohnmacht for 
enticing a 14-year-old girl via Instagram to engage in sexual conduct and for engaging in this 
criminal conduct while a registered sex offender.

The Office, primarily through the work its Violent and Organized Crime Unit, also focuses on 
prosecuting murders, and dismantling gangs and violent drug crews, with a particular emphasis on 
violence prosecutions in the Bronx. 
• According to the New York City Police Department, in the first half of 2019 (as compared to the first 
half of 2018) in the Bronx: 
o 
Murders were down 33% 
o Shootings were down 5% 
o The number of shooting victims was down 8.5% 
• In July 2018, prosecutors convicted Stiven Siri-Revnoso for the June 2016 murder of Jessica White,

Reynoso was sentenced to life plus five years in prison. 
• In December 2018. Sean Peter, Jason Campbell and Steven Syder were convicted of the murder of 
Brian Gray in the Bronx in October 2012 and for committing narcotics and firearms offenses. The 
proof at trial showed that in retaliation for an attempted drug robbery, Peter, Campbell and Syder 
followed Gray and three friends from a local bodega to a nearby porch on Barker Avenue in the 
Bronx. After leaving the area to arm themselves, Peter, Campbell, and Syder returned and opened 
fire fatally wounding Gray and injuring two other individuals. Peter was sentenced to 23 years in 
prison. Campbell was sentenced to 23 years in prison. and Syder was sentenced to 20 years in 
prison. 
• In March 2019, followi g a five-week jury trial, prosecutors obtained convictions of the leaders of the 
Blood Hound Brims gang. one of the most violent and fastest-growing factions of the Bloods street 
and prison gang that operated principally in New York City. upstate New York. Pennsylvania. and

operating in the Bronx. On June 11, 2016, at the corner of East 175th Street and Monroe Avenue in 
the Bronx, Felton shot Marvin Harris 13 times, killing him, after Harris insulted Felton and 
challenged Felton's status within the drug territory. Six months later, at the corner of East 
175th Street and Weeks Avenue, one block away from the scene of the Harris murder, Felton shot a 
rival drug dealer named Edwin Romero four times, then shot Jose Morales in the head, killing 
him. Felton was also convicted of conspiring to distribute crack cocaine, heroin, cocaine and 
marijuana and of related firearms offenses. Felton was sentenced to life plus 75 years in prison. 
• In 2018 and 2019, the Violent and Organized Crime Unit suerPs-sfully prosecuted high-ranking

Protecting the Environment and Public Health 
The Environmental Protection Unit in the Office's Civil Division protects the environment and public 
health in this district (and beyond). 
• In June 2018, the Office sued the New York City Housing Authority for systematically violating lead 
paint safety regulations, failing to provide sanitary living conditions as required by law, making false 
statements about these conditions, and deceiving HUD inspectors. The lawsuit was resolved by 
a historic settlement providing for the appointment of a federal monitor for NYCHA, imposing strict 
compliance deadlines, and obligating New York City to provide billions of dollars to support 
NYCHA's remedial efforts. 
• The Environmental Protection Unit represents the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and other 
federal agencies in a wide range of environmental enforcement matters in this district, 
including Superfund, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Clean Water Act, and lead-paint 
safety cases. One significant example is the Office's June 2018 lawsuit against the City of Mount 
Vernon for failing to comply with Clean Water Act storm sewer permit requirements designed to 
prevent raw sewage and other illicit pollutants from flowing from Mount Vernon's storm sewer 
system into the Hutchinson and Bronx Rivers. 
• The Environmental Protection Unit also brings cases on behalf of the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
and the Food and Drug Administration to protect food safety and eliminate other public health 
threats. In June 2017, for example, this Office sued to shut down a fish smokehouse that had 
repeatedly been found to have Listeria bacteria in the facility as a result of recurring violations of 
food safety regulations. 
• The Environmental Protection Unit also acts to ensure that companies cannot use bankruptcy to 
avoid their responsibility for environmental contamination. In July 2019, this Office entered into a 
settlement in In re Magnesium Corporation, which requires the debtors to pay more than $33 
million for clean-up of a contaminated Superfund site. In addition, in 2014, this Office obtained 
the largest ever litigation recovery by the government for clean-up of environmental contamination, 
in the Tronox bankruptcy. That settlement included, among other things, more than $4.4 billion for 
environmental clean-up and liabilities arising from contaminated sites across the country.

Combating the Opioid Crisis 
The United States faces an epidemic of overdoses and deaths from prescription and synthetic 
opioids. The Office is committed to prosecuting those responsible for fueling this crisis. In addition 
to targeting street-level dealers and their suppliers, the Office has aggressively pursued medical 
professionals who divert these highly-addictive pills, including doctors, pharmacies, and a major 
drug distributor. 
• In April 2019, in the first prosecution of its kind, the Narcotics Unit charged one of the nation's 
largest drug distributors. Rochester Drug Cooperative, and two of the company's senior executives, 
with distributing drugs that helped fuel the opioid epidemic. This case represents the first time 
executives of a pharmaceutical distributor and the distributor itself have been charged with drug 
trafficking. The charges are a reminder to drug companies and drug distributors of their 
responsibilities to put public health before corporate profits and to adhere to the highest standards of 
ethics and compliance in placing dangerous pharmaceutical products in the marketplace. 
The Office has also been aggressive in prosecuting "dirty doctors" and other medical professionals 
who have helped to perpetuate the opioid crisis. 
• In October 2018, the Narcotics Unit charged five doctors, one pharmacist. and a physician's assistant 
as part of a coordinated takedown of trusted health professionals who abused their positions to 
illegally sell oxycodone. The case against these defendants is pending. 
• In December 2018, the Unit convicted a Staten Island doctor who prescribed millions of oxycodone 
pills to patients whom he knew had no legitimate need for the highly-addictive drug. He is scheduled 
to be sentenced in January 2020. 
• In March 2018, the Complex Frauds & Cybercrime Unit charged five Manhattan based doctors for 
accepting bribes and kickbacks from Insys, a pharmaceutical company, in exchange for prescribing 
Subsys, a potent fentanyl-based spray. To date, four of the five doctors have been convicted; the 
remaining charged defendant is awaiting trial in this case. 
In addition to pursuing medical professionals, the Office has redoubled its enforcement efforts by 
partnering with the New York City Police Department to establish the Overdose Response Initiative, 
which treats every overdose as a crime scene and aims to hold drug traffickers responsible for their 
roles in the opioid crisis. The Narcotics Unit has secured convictions of multiple individuals who 
distributed drugs that caused overdoses. 
EFTA00023946
--- PAGE 10 ---
PRIORITIES WEBPAGE 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
• In one such case, in December 2018, the Narcotics Unit secured a 25 year prison sentence, following 
the conviction at trial of an individual who sold heroin that resulted in two overdose deaths. 
• In May 2019, the Narcotics Unit convicted a Staten Island drug dealer who sold fentanyl-laced 
heroin that led to two overdoses, one of which resulted in the death of a 26-year-old man. 
Countering State-Sponsored Cybercrime 
The Office has moved aggressively to investigate and prosecute cybercrime cases of national and 
international significance. 
• In March 2018, the Complex Frauds 8z Cybercrime Unit unsealed charges against nine Iranians 
associated with the Mabna Institute, which conducted a massive computer hacking campaign on 
behalf of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. The Mabna Institute is allegedly responsible for 
stealing academic research, intellectual property, and other confidential business information from 
144 U.S.-based universities, 176 universities in 21 foreign countries, 47 domestic and foreign private 
sector companies, and several U.S. Government agencies, among other victims. The Mabna case was 
the product of multiple federal and international agencies dedicated work to take down this state-
sponsored hacking group. Criminal charges were announced in coordination with sanctions imposed 
by the Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Asset Control, which designated the Mabna 
Institute and its hackers for sanctions for conducting malicious cyber activities. 
• In December 2018, the Complex Frauds & Cybercrime Unit charged two Chinese nationals affiliated 
with the Chinese-sponsored hacking group "APT10" with conducting extensive hacking campaigns 
on behalf of the Chinese government to steal intellectual property and confidential business 
information from more than 45 technology and defense companies. APTio, known as an "Advanced 
Persistence Threat" group, compromised data held by managed service providers, firms that other 
companies trust to store, process, and protect commercial data, including intellectual property and 
other confidential business information. 
• In March 2016, the Complex Frauds & Cybercrime Unit charged seven Iranian nationals for 
conducting a state-sponsored coordinated series of "Distributed Denial of Service attacks against the 
U.S. Financial Sector between 2011 and 2013. The seven defendants were allegedly associated with 
two Iran-based cybersecurity companies — ITSec Team and Mersad — that operated as fronts for the 
Iran government's offensive cyber operations. During the campaign, the defendants leveraged large 
botnets consisting of thousands of compromised servers around the world to systematically send 
malicious Internet traffic to servers belonging to 46 U.S. banks, resulting in disabling the servers and 
costing the banks tens of millions of dollars to remediate. Notably, the indictment separately 
charged one of the ITSec Team defendants, Hamid Firoozi, with the 2013 compromise of the

Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition systems of the Bowman Dam in Rye, New York. Had the 
sluice gate (the gate that controls the flow of water released through the dam) not been disconnected 
from the system for maintenance, the compromise would have allowed the Iranian government to 
remotely control the operations of the dam. 
Prosecuting Fraud 
The Office's Criminal and Civil Divisions prosecute fraud on a wide scale. The Criminal 
Division investigates and prosecutes cybercrime, complex frauds and white collar crimes, and 
securities and commodities fraud. The Civil Division's Civil Frauds Unit uses civil enforcement 
statutes to investigate and prosecute numerous types of misconduct, including financial fraud, 
healthcare fraud, and program and grant fraud, and in recent years has obtained admissions of 
wrongdoing from dozens of defendants and over $5 billion in recoveries on behalf of the federal 
government. The Civil Frauds Unit and the Criminal Division's "white collar" units closely 
coordinate with each other to maximize the recovery of criminal fraud proceeds and to return 
that money to victims. 
In October 2019, Representative Christopher Collins pleaded guilty to participating in a scheme to 
commit insider trading and to making false statements to federal law enforcement agents. Prior to 
his guilty plea, Collins had represented the 27th District of New York as a member of the U.S. House 
of Representatives. His son Cameron Collins, and Stephen Zarsky also pleaded guilty to 
participating in the insider trading scheme. Representative Collins, Cameron Collins and Stephen 
Zarsky are awaiting sentencing. 
• In 2019, the Civil Frauds Unit filed and settled two healthcare fraud lawsuits against national 
pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance. Inc. for a total of $269.2 million, relating to Walgreens's 
improper billings to government healthcare programs. The Office alleged that Walgreens improperly 
billed the government for insulin pens that patients did not need and made false representations to 
Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs in connection with that practice, and also that Walgreens 
sought and obtained reimbursement from Medicaid for prescription drugs at improperly inflated 
prices. 
• In 2018, the Criminal Division's Complex Frauds & Cybercrime Unit pursued significant investment 
fraud cases, including the prosecution of William "Billy" McFarland. McFarland was sentenced to six 
years' imprisonment for, most notably, fraud in connection with promoting the notorious "Fyre 
Festival" that left hundreds of ticket purchasers virtually stranded without food and shelter—not to 
mention entertainment—on the beaches of Exuma, in the Bahamas. 
• In 2018, the Securities and Commodities Fraud Task Force charged three former employees of the 
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) and three executives at KPMG for their 
alleged roles in a scheme to illegally obtain confidential PCAOB information and use it to improve 
EFTA00023948

KPMG audit performance. To date, three defendants have pleaded guilty and two defendants were 
found guilty after trial. The remaining defendant is awaiting trial. 
• In 2018, the Securities and Commodities Fraud Task Force successfully prosecuted Craig Carton, a 
nationally-syndicated sports talk radio host, for participating in a Ponzi scheme based on the 
supposed purchase and resale of tickets to Hamilton and other major productions. Carton, who was 
convicted following a trial, received a sentence of 42 months in prison. 
• In 2017, the Civil Frauds Unit obtained a judgment of over $206 million against the entities formerly 
known as Allied Home Mortgage Capital Corporation and Allied Home Mortgage 
Corporation (collectively "Allied"), in connection with their fraudulent misconduct while 
participating in the Federal Housing Administration ("FHA") mortgage insurance program. After a 
five week trial, a jury found that Allied falsely certified that thousands of high risk, low quality loans 
were eligible for FHA insurance and submitted insurance claims to the U.S. Department of Housing 
and Urban Development ("HUD") when any of those loans defaulted. In the same trial, the Office 
also obtained a jury verdict, and $25 million judgment, against Allied's President and Chief 
Executive Officer Jim C. Hodge for his participation in this fraudulent conduct. 
• In 2016, the Civil Frauds Unit obtained a $1.2 billion settlement of a False Claims Act and FIRREA 
lamisulagainstwellsEargillank,L,LABILmiellEarnaxcglitiyo—the largest recovery ever in a 
Federal Housing Administration mortgage fraud case. The Office alleged that, as a participant in the 
FHA Direct Endorsement Lender program, Wells Fargo engaged in reckless underwriting practices 
and intentionally failed to report seriously defective loans to HUD. 
• In 2016, the Office brought important criminal cases in the area of Medicare and Medicaid fraud, 
such as 17.S. n. St-did Javed. Javed was convicted for operating nine pharmacies in the New York City 
area that had submitted more than $8.5 million in fraudulent claims to Medicare and Medicaid for 
prescription drugs that were not delivered to customers. 
• In 2015, the Civil Frauds Unit announced a coordinated $714 million settlement of civil lawsuits 
brought by the United States and others against the Bank of New York Mellon, in connection with 
allegations that the Bank engaged in fraud and other misconduct when providing foreign exchange 
services to its customers. The Office's lawsuit alleged that, contrary to representations made by Bank 
of New York Mellon to its clients that the Bank provided "best rates" and "best execution," the Bank 
actually gave clients the worst reported interbank rates of the trading day.

Protecting Civil Rights 
The Office is a leader in the prosecution of civil and criminal cases to ensure the protection of civil 
rights for individuals within the District. 
• In March 2019, as part of its continued enforcement work under the Americans with Disabilities Act, 
the Civil Division's Civil Rights Unit helped secure a partial summary judgment that, if applied going 
forward, would obligate the MTA to install elevators whenever it performs a subway station 
renovation that affects the station's usability, regardless of cost. 
• In March 2019, the Civil Rights Unit resolved its sixteenth design and construction case under the 
Fair Housing Act, by entering into a Settlement Agreement requiring Sutton Manor. a condominium 
complex in Mount Kisco to engage in extensive retrofits to make the individual units and common 
areas of the complex more accessible to residents with disabilities. The Unit resolved a similar suit 
against Webster Management in December 2018, and another such suit against Ginsburg 
Development in April 2018. 
• In July 2018, the Civil Rights and Public Corruption Units obtained the conviction and sentencing of 
New York State Correction Officers for the brutal beating of inmate Kevin Moore, and for falsifying 
records to cover up the beating. 
• In November 2017, the Civil Rights Unit settled a race discrimination lawsuit against the New York 
City Department of Transportation for a pattern and practice of Title VII violations, requiring the 
City to pay $1.3 million in damages and revise its promotion policies. 
• In September 2017, the Civil Rights and Public Corruption Units secured a 30-year sentence for 
Brian Coll, a New York City Correction Officer, following his conviction after a jury trial for beating

an inmate, Ronald Spear, to death and for obstructing justice by covering up the true cause of Spear's

• In August 2017, the Civil Rights and Public Corruption Units convicted Rodiny Calypso, a New York 
City Correction Officer, for filing a false report in connection with the assault of a handcuffed inmate 
at Rikers Island. 
• Also in August 2017, the Civil Rights and Public Corruption Units secured the conviction and jail 
time for New York State Correction Officer Jeffrey Green, who pleaded guilty to violating the

Thank you so much for these—very helpful (and sorry I didn't realize the message pad scans also had the same pages

On these: 
• 
Yes, please send over the copy of the gj transcript disc when you can.

• 
Yes, please get us the paper evidence from NY, VI, and Reiter as soon as you can.

My understanding from past FBI cases is that CART completes some sort of paperwork documenting the dates on 
which they conduct data extractions. We need that for all of the extractions in this case, please (It may not be 
302s). 
• 
On the evidence from disks, understood. In order to give you more time, we are going to tell the defense

Message Pad Scans: The message pads were scanned with the post it notes on them and the very next page is the page 
without the post it note, so the pages are back to back.

Evidence scans: Are you referring to the scans from the FL file? We sent those over with the original message pad scans 
last year. If you need that again, let us know and we can get another copy over to you. As far as paper evidence from the

FBI file: We have that ready for you.

Hi MI and 
The drive you provided us has some scans on it (looks like they're scans of the message pads). As I recall, there was a 
larger scanning project, during which the FBI scanned all of the paper that was vouchered in evidence. Are you able to 
provide us with all of those scans this week? 
With respect to the message pads in particular, I think you mentioned that they were scanned both with post-it notes on 
them and also without the post-it notes. The version on this drive just looks like it has the post-it note scans.

Thanks so much for your help with the Maxwell discovery so far. I have some follow-up questions about the most recent 
batch you provided, and wanted to check in on the longer term tasks we discussed last month. 
Below are some questions regarding the discovery 
dropped off a few days ago with requests for additional items: 
• 
The last page of the attached appears to be a photograph of a disc. The label on the disc seems to suggest it 
contains grand jury transcripts. Have you given us those transcripts? 
• 
The message pad scans you provided still have post-it notes on top of several of the message pad pages. I think 
mentioned that each pad had been scanned twice, but I'm only seeing one copy of each pad—and those 
copies all of post-its on them. That's true of nearly every "Notebook" pdf you provided in the "Message pad 
scans" folder. Would you please get us a scans of these without post-its on them? 
• 
It looks like we're still missing SW returns for the 20 mag 6719 warrant and for the NH premises warrant. Would 
you please get us copies of those returns? 
Following up on our conversation last month, I think we're still waiting on the below items from you guys. Would you 
please be able to get us these this week? 
• 
Full FBI sentinel file 
• 
CART paperwork regarding the extraction of data from all devices seized during the investigation 
• 
All 302s regarding the extraction of data from any seized devices and the review of images (both digital and hard 
copy) seized during the investigation, including from Epstein's properties. 
• 
Scans of the files Reiter provided to the FBI and provide us with all of those scanned materials 
• 
Scans of all hard copy documents, including photos, in the possession of the FBI that have not yet been scanned, 
including anything seized during any searches. Please produce to SDNY all of those scans, except any nude or 
partially nude images. For nude or partially nude images, please provide us with a log detailing how many such 
images were scanned, where they were from, and where they are being stored. 
• 
Copies of the contents of all the discs that were seized and searched pursuant to search warrants to a platform 
for review. Then please produce to SDNY a copy all of those materials, except any nude or partially nude images.

FBI office, but that in the meantime we are still working on getting copies of non-nude images to produce to them.

Hey all, below is a summary of the discovery items you've requested. 
(USANYS) 
Message Pad Scans: The message pads were scanned with the post it notes on them and the very next page is the page 
without the post it note, so the pages are back to back. 
Papers from Miami case file (grand jury testimony): This is a disk — I can copy it and send it over to you. 
Evidence scans: Are you referring to the scans from the FL file? We sent those over with the original message pad scans 
last year. If you need that again, let us know and we can get another copy over to you. As far as paper evidence from the 
NY and VI searches, and the paper provided by Reiter, we can get that over to you by the end of the week. 
FBI file: We have that ready for you. 
CART: There are no 302s regarding the extraction of devices. 
Evidence from disks: This is a large volume and we've been working on this and removing nude/semi nude images. This is 
the only thing that would be difficult to complete by Friday. If we could have a little more time to pull this together, that 
would be very helpful. 
If it's helpful to talk through some of this via phone, we are happy to do that as well.

Hey guys, 
Apologies but today I was out In the field on surveillance and 
was also out of the office so we've not 
been able to connect on these discovery questions. We will be back in the office tomorrow and will dive into 
this as best we can. We have several calls tomorrow, one of which is with Tony Figuero but well do our best to 
get on this list. That being said I don't want to make you any promises that everything will be compiled by 
tomorrow and that we will have an answer to all of your questions but we can jump on a call tomorrow if you 
like to square some of this away.

Hi 
and 
The drive you provided us has some scans on it (looks like they're scans of the message pads). As I recall, there was a 
larger scanning project, during which the FBI scanned all of the paper that was vouchered in evidence. Are you able to 
provide us with all of those scans this week? 
With respect to the message pads in particular, I think you mentioned that they were scanned both with post-it notes on 
them and also without the post-it notes. The version on this drive just looks like it has the post-it note scans. 
Thanks,

Thanks so much for your help with the Maxwell discovery so far. I have some follow-up questions about the most recent 
batch you provided, and wanted to check in on the longer term tasks we discussed last month. 
Below are some questions regarding the discovery 
dropped off a few days ago with requests for additional items: 
• 
The last page of the attached appears to be a photograph of a disc. The label on the disc seems to suggest it 
contains grand jury transcripts. Have you given us those transcripts? 
• 
The message pad scans you provided still have post-it notes on top of several of the message pad pages. I think 
mentioned that each pad had been scanned twice, but I'm only seeing one copy of each pad—and those 
copies all of post-its on them. That's true of nearly every "Notebook" pdf you provided in the "Message pad 
scans" folder. Would you please get us a scans of these without post-its on them? 
• 
It looks like we're still missing SW returns for the 20 mag 6719 warrant and for the NH premises warrant. Would 
you please get us copies of those returns? 
Following up on our conversation last month, I think we're still waiting on the below items from you guys. Would you 
please be able to get us these this week? 
• 
Full FBI sentinel file 
• 
CART paperwork regarding the extraction of data from all devices seized during the investigation 
• 
All 302s regarding the extraction of data from any seized devices and the review of images (both digital and hard 
copy) seized during the investigation, including from Epstein's properties. 
• 
Scans of the files Reiter provided to the FBI and provide us with all of those scanned materials 
• 
Scans of all hard copy documents, including photos, in the possession of the FBI that have not yet been scanned, 
including anything seized during any searches. Please produce to SDNY all of those scans, except any nude or 
partially nude images. For nude or partially nude images, please provide us with a log detailing how many such 
images were scanned, where they were from, and where they are being stored. 
• 
Copies of the contents of all the discs that were seized and searched pursuant to search warrants to a platform 
for review. Then please produce to SDNY a copy all of those materials, except any nude or partially nude images. 
For nude or partially nude images, please provide us with a log detailing how many such images were located, 
where they were from, and where they are being stored. 
Please let me know if you have any questions or if it would be useful to hop on a call.

So far, actually seems to be functioning. Sorry for the false alarm, but perhaps she just figured out how to open the files she 
was previously having difficulty with. 
If I receive any follow up about additional issues, I will let you know. 
Appreciate your responsiveness and willingness to help!

There are many different types of files on the drive; excel, pdf, tif, video, audio, etc. Consequently, it will be difficult to 
diagnose the issue(s) without knowing the specific files/folders that are problematic. If you would send over the particulars 
we will work to provide a fix.

Good afternoon, 
Maxwell was provided this drive on Tuesday. Staff have reported to me that she has reported that certain files do not work. 
Can you advise what types of files (i.e., video/excel/etc.) are on the drive and what players or applications may be necessary 
to view them? I'm trying to figure out what reasons may be for issues with the material on the drive. 
Thank you,

We just sent another drive via FedEx. This drive contains all of the discovery in the case to date. The password for the drive

WASHINGTON, DC 2O51O 
August 10, 2019 
The Honorable William P. Barr 
Attorney General 
U.S. Department of Justice 
Washington, DC. 20530 
Dear Attorney General Barr: 
INTELLIGENCE 
JUDICIARY 
BANKING 
This morning, Jeffrey Epstein, the wealthy American financier indicted on numerous 
charges for running an international child sex trafficking ring, was found dead by apparent 
suicide. Epstein was being held in federal Bureau of Prisons custody after a federal judge denied 
him bail. Disturbingly, his suicide occurred after an incident less than three weeks ago when he 
was found injured and semi-conscious in his cell from a possible suicide attempt. News reporting 
indicates that he was then placed on suicide watch but may have been taken off suicide watch 
before today's events. 
The Department of Justice failed, and today Jeffrey Epstein's co-conspirators think they 
might have just gotten one last sweetheart deal. Every single person in the Justice Department —
from your Main Justice headquarters staff all the way to the night-shift jailer — knew that this 
man was a suicide risk, and that his dark secrets couldn't be allowed to die with him. 
Given Epstein's previous attempted suicide, he should have been locked in a padded 
room under unbroken, 24/7, constant surveillance. Obviously, heads must roll. 
During your nomination process, you committed to me to ensuring that justice would be 
done for his victims. I was pleased to see the Department open an investigation into the 
mishandling of the ridiculous 2008 non-prosecution agreement, and then the decision to bring 
subsequent charges against Epstein. Knowing this monster's history of thwarting justice, I also 
called for him to be held without bail upon his July 6 arrest. 
It should have been abundantly clear that Epstein would go to any lengths to avoid being 
held accountable for his crimes, including by killing himself. Being responsible for Epstein's 
custody and prosecution, the Department of Justice should not have allowed this to happen. His 
death not only deprives his victims of the opportunity to confront him in court and to see him 
held accountable for his crimes, but also makes it harder to unravel his ring and to hold 
accountable the many other powerful men who raped and exploited these children. 
The Department must answer the following urgent questions for the American people: 
1. Was Epstein in fact placed on suicide watch following his previous possible 
suicide attempt?

2. If so, was Epstein taken off suicide watch prior to his apparent suicide this 
morning? And if so, why? 
3. Can you confirm that you are ordering two investigations: one — presumably 
Inspector General investigation — into the Bureau of prison's mismanagement of 
the incarceration of Epstein; and another — presumably FBI investigation — into 
any possible criminal activity surrounding this mismanagement? 
4. Can you certify that all other potential evidence that investigators were 
pursuing relating to Epstein's co-conspirators is being immediately secured by the 
Department of Justice, so that no additional evidence or potential testimony is 
also squandered? 
Thank you in advance for your resolve to peruse justice in this matter. 
Sincerely, 
tJ,

All, 
OCME just completed the autopsy and the findings are consistent with strangulation/hanging. Epstein had a broken 
hiatal bone and injuries to the left shoulder that are consistent with hanging. Per OCME, there is no reason to suspect 
that Epstein did not hang himself. OCME will wait to finalize the report until after the toxicology reports come back, 
and OCME has had an opportunity to review any reports of interviews of the first guards on the scene who discovered 
Epstein. 
We will continue to keep you posted. Please let us know if you have any questions. Thanks.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
AUGUST 12, 2019 
ATTORNEY GENERAL WILLIAM P. BARR DELIVERS 
REMARKS AT THE GRAND LODGE FRATERNAL ORDER OF 
POLICE'S 64TH NATIONAL BIENNIAL CONFERENCE 
New Orleans, LA 
Remarks as prepared for delivery 
Good morning! Thank you, Chuck [Canterbury], for your kind introduction. Jim 
[Pasco], it's great to see you and thanks for all that you have done for the FOP 
over the years. 
EFTA00023985
--- PAGE 3 ---
Congressman Scalise, it is good to see you this morning. Thank you for your 
support for law enforcement. We will never forget the heroism of the Capitol 
Police Officers that day and how their swift action prevented a mass tragedy. 
Before I begin, I would like to briefly address the news from the Manhattan 
Correctional Center over the weekend regarding Jeffrey Epstein. This case was 
very important to the Department. It was important to the dedicated prosecutors 
and agents who investigated the case and were preparing it for trial. Most 
importantly, this case was important to the victims who had the courage to come 
forward and deserved the opportunity to confront the accused in court. 
I was appalled — indeed, the entire Department was — and frankly angry, to learn 
of the MCC's failure to adequately secure this prisoner. We are now learning of 
serious irregularities at this facility that are deeply concerning and that demand a 
thorough investigation. The FBI and the Office of Inspector General are already 
doing just that. We will get to the bottom of what happened at the MCC and we 
will hold people accountable for this failure. 
Let me assure you that this case will continue on against anyone who was 
complicit with Epstein. Any co-conspirators should not rest easy. The victims 
deserve justice, and we will ensure they get it. 
And now, let me turn to the reason I am here, to renew a relationship with old 
friends. 
It is a real privilege for me to join the Fraternal Order of Police this morning. I 
enjoyed a close relationship with the FOP my first time around in this job, and I 
am looking forward to an even closer one this time. 
Let me say I am proud to serve in an Administration and under President Trump 
who so strongly support law enforcement. 
To my mind, there is no more noble profession than serving as a police officer. 
You put your own life and well-being on the line to protect your communities. 
Your families spend anxious nights, so we can sleep in peace. You never know 
what your day may bring — what uncertainty, danger, or threat you might face. 
But you still get up, put on your uniform and badge, kiss your loved ones, and 
head out to face whatever risks might come your way. 
This calls for a special kind of bravery. I remember that when our troops went off 
to war in the First Gulf War, they were cheered along the highways as they went. 
And when they returned in victory, they were cheered and given ticker tape 
parades — and rightly so. 
But when police officers leave their precincts every morning, there are no crowds 
on the highway cheering you. And when you come home at the end of the day 
after a job well done, there are no ticker tape parades. 
EFTA00023986
--- PAGE 4 ---
One reason for this is that law enforcement is fighting a different type of war. We 
are fighting an unrelenting, never-ending fight against criminal predators in our 
society. While there are battles won and lost each day, there is never a final 
resolution — a final victory is never in sight. 
It takes a very special kind of courage to wage this kind of fight — a special kind of 
commitment; a special kind of self-sacrifice. 
So it is an honor for me to have been invited here, to be among you, and to have 
the opportunity, as Attorney General, to support you and salute you. 
The horrors of El Paso and Dayton last week still weigh heavily on all of us. We 
still mourn the victims of these evil acts. We are also proud of the police who 
responded to the scenes and prevented further bloodshed. 
It is particularly stirring to watch the footage from Dayton. As the shooting 
started and civilians fled, you can see the police charging headlong towards the 
shooter, whom they quickly and skillfully neutralized. Every American should 
thank God that we still have men and women like them — like you — who stand 
ready to run toward the mortal danger. 
Let me assure you that the President will not let acts of mass shootings and 
domestic terrorism go unanswered. He has been consulting widely and has 
directed me and Director Wray to work with our state and local partners, as well 
as the private sector, to develop strategies and measures to address these threats, 
including developing tools that can assist us in detecting potential mass shooters 
before they strike. I anticipate that we will be sharing range of proposals —
legislative as well as operational — in the near future. I can assure you that our 
proposals will involve collaboration, with you — our colleagues at the state and 
local levels. 
The recent atrocities also remind us of a basic truth. Human beings are capable of 
great good, but also of the basest evil. Even in a healthy society, violence, 
lawlessness, and predation lie just below the surface. In the final analysis, what 
stands between chaos and carnage on the one hand, and the civilized and tranquil 
society we all yearn for, is the thin blue line of law enforcement. You are the ones 
manning the ramparts — day in, and day out. 
Even in the best of times, there is no tougher calling than serving as a police 
officer. Today, it is much tougher than it has ever been. 
The Framers believed that a free society can only exist if the people have the 
personal virtue and self-restraint to control their own worst passions and 
appetites. 
If people lose the values and moral discipline to control themselves, then 
government would increasingly have to use external force to keep order, and the 
community would gradually lose its freedom. This is what James Madison was 
EFTA00023987
--- PAGE 5 ---
talking about when he said, "We have staked our future on the ability of each of us 
to govern ourselves." 
We live in an age now when the institutions we have relied on to inculcate values 
and self-restraint have been under constant assault for over 5o years. As a result, 
we see about us increased social pathology: boys growing up without fathers; 
alienated and angry young men; gangs engaged in the most brutal violence; mass 
shootings; increasing mental illness and suicide among young people; a drug 
epidemic inflicting casualties beyond what we would sustain in a major war; 
growing domestic violence; an increase in sexual assaults and child exploitation. 
You name it. And who is expected to deal with this? As other institutions fail and 
abdicate, who is expected to stand their ground? Who is expected to pick up the 
pieces? You are. The police. The thin blue line. 
That is why I say that the job you are asked to do has never been more 
challenging. The risks you are called on to take have never been greater. 
Despite the fact that the majority of the American people do support the police, 
unfortunately, over the past few years, there has been an increasingly vocal 
minority that regularly attacks the police and advances a narrative that it is the 
police that are the bad guys rather than the criminals. Whenever there is a 
confrontation involving the use of force by police, they automatically start 
screaming for the officers' scalps, regardless of the facts. 
I am not suggesting there are never abuses. As with all human institutions there 
are sometimes bad apples; and we will deal with that. But these are very much the 
exceptions, not the rule. If anything, I continue to be amazed at the 
professionalism of our police officers in the most extreme circumstances. 
The anti-police narrative is fanning disrespect for the law. In recent years, we 
have witnessed increasing toleration of the notion that it is somehow okay to 
resist the police. 
Previously, it was well understood that, regardless of the circumstances, physical 
resistance is unacceptable because it necessarily leads to a spiral of escalating 
violence that endangers the safety of the officer, the suspect, and all in the 
vicinity. For that reason, virtually all jurisdictions have made resistance a serious 
crime. 
Not too long ago influential public voices — whether in the media or among 
community and civic leaders — stressed the need to comply with police 
commands, even if one thinks they are unjust. "Comply first" and, if you think 
you have been wronged, "complain later." 
But we don't hear this much anymore. Instead, when an incident escalates due to 
a suspect's violent resistance to police, that fact is usually ignored by the 
EFTA00023988
--- PAGE 6 ---
commentary. The officer's every action is dissected, but the suspect's resistance, 
and the danger it posed, frequently goes without mention. 
We need to get back to basics. We need public voices, in the media and elsewhere, 
to underscore the need to "Comply first, and, if warranted, complain later." This 
will make everyone safe — the police, suspects, and the community at large. And 
those who resist must be prosecuted for that crime. We must have zero tolerance 
for resisting police. This will save lives. 
We are seeing disrespect for law enforcement in other ways. We were all 
nauseated by the spectacle of prancing punks pelting New York police officers 
with water and plastic buckets. Unfortunately, these were not isolated events. 
From 2014 through 2017, there has been a 20 percent increase in assaults against 
police, up to about 60,000 per year. 
This Administration will not tolerate violence against police, and we will do all we 
can to protect the safety of law enforcement officers. I will share with you one 
proposal that we will be advancing after Labor Day. We will be proposing 
legislation providing that in cases of mass murder, or in cases of murder of a law 
enforcement officer, there will be a timetable for judicial proceedings that will 
allow imposition of any death sentence without undue delay. Punishment must 
be swift and certain. 
There is another development that is demoralizing to law enforcement and 
dangerous to public safety. That is the emergence in some of our large cities of 
District Attorneys that style themselves as "social justice" reformers, who spend 
their time undercutting the police, letting criminals off the hook, and refusing to 
enforce the law. 
These anti-law enforcement DAs have tended to emerge in jurisdictions where the 
election is largely determined by the primary. Frequently, these candidates 
ambush an incumbent DA in the primary with misleading campaigns and large 
infusions of money from outside groups. 
Once in office, they have been announcing their refusal to enforce broad swathes 
of the criminal law. Most disturbing is that some are refusing to prosecute cases 
of resisting police. Some are refusing to prosecute various theft cases or drug 
cases, even where the suspect is involved in distribution. And when they do deign 
to charge a criminal suspect, they are frequently seeking sentences that are 
pathetically lenient. So these cities are headed back to the days of revolving door 
justice. The results will be predictable. More crime; more victims. 
One of my messages today is that the American people need to pay close attention 
to issues of public safety in their communities. As a society we should not take 
our police officers for granted. 
I would like to see the American people gain a renewed appreciation of the noble 
work done by our police officers in protecting our communities. I would like to 
EFTA00023989
--- PAGE 7 ---
see increased recognition that being a police officer is the toughest job in the 
country, and it is getting tougher. I would like to see a greater commitment to 
supporting the police. 
The "thin blue line" is getting thinner. The number of sworn officers per capita 
has been dropping. We are now in a full employment economy. With lucrative 
and safer jobs now available in other sectors, police departments must compete 
hard to attract the best candidates. 
Many cities are already unable to fill their ranks, and vacancy rates are mounting. 
The harder we make the police officer's job — the less they are supported — the 
harder it will be to attract qualified candidates. And I think we can anticipate that 
those who come forward to serve will be increasingly attracted to jurisdictions 
where the community supports the police. 
It is imperative that state and local jurisdictions not scrimp on investing in law 
enforcement. At time when governments are trying to be all things to all people, it 
is important not to forget the basics. The very reason we have government is to 
protect the public safety. The very first duty of government is to provide the 
police. If we are to maintain the professional police forces we currently have, we 
must ensure ample budgets to fund good compensation, full force levels, sufficient 
equipment and adequate training. 
I would like to turn for a moment to my priorities and the importance of our 
partnership. 
Two of my highest priorities are continuing the fight against violent crime and 
combating the opioid epidemic and the scourge of other dangerous drugs, like 
resurging methamphetimine. 
When I last served as Attorney General in the early 9o's, violent crime was at all-
time high levels in the country. Starting in the 1960's, we had gone through three 
decades of "reform" that turned our criminal justice system into a laughable 
revolving door. Incarceration rates dropped precipitously; and crime rates 
tripled, reaching a high in 1991-92. 
Starting with the Reagan Administration, and running though the Bush, Clinton, 
and Bush years, we strengthened our criminal justice systems at both the Federal 
and state level. We focused on getting chronic violent offenders off the streets and 
into prisons to serve meaningful sentences that protected the community. We 
worked closely with our State and local partners on programs like Weed & Seed 
and Triggerlock. 
The result? A steady and sharp drop in violent crime starting in 1992. Today, 
violent crime has been cut in half. 
Unfortunately, in the last few years of the Obama Administration, the violent 
crime rate started rising again. Days after his inauguration, President Trump 
EFTA00023990
--- PAGE 8 ---
issued an Executive Order with two clear directives. First, he declared that this 
Administration would reduce crime in America. Second, he directed the 
Department of Justice to take the lead on Federal actions to support law 
enforcement efforts nationwide and to collaborate with State, tribal, and local 
jurisdictions to restore public safety to all of our communities. 
We take this responsibility seriously and, working closely with our State and local 
partners, we have succeeded once again in driving crime rates back down. I am 
proud of our work together on Project Safe Neighborhood, and a variety of joint 
anti-gang and anti-gun crime efforts. 
We have made a difference, but we cannot rest on our laurels. Crime levels are 
still too high and we must keep up a full court press. In the weeks ahead, we will 
be doubling down on our attack on violent crime. We will be expanding our 
efforts against gun violence and violent gangs. Once again, we plan on doing this 
shoulder-to-shoulder with our State and local partners. 
On the drug front, we are facing a monumental challenge. To be frank, the 
Obama Administration showed little interest in prosecuting the fight against 
dangerous drugs. A tsunami built up and has been crashing over the country, 
bringing death and destruction. 
The death toll from opioids alone is higher than we would sustain in a major war. 
Indeed, in a single year, we lose more people to opioids than we lost during the 
entire Vietnam War. 
Fortunately, this Administration has thrown down the gauntlet. It declared a 
national emergency, marshalled the Nation's resources, and is fighting back. 
We have a robust program to attack the problem of over-prescription and 
diversion of legal opioids, and we are definitely having an impact. Prescription 
rates are markedly down. I am confident these successes will accelerate. 
I think our attack on illicit opioids is building momentum. It is going to be a long 
difficult road, but we are gaining real traction. 
As you know, this Administration has sharply increased drug trafficking 
prosecutions, especially as to opioids. In 2018 we prosecuted 36 percent more 
opioid-related offenses than we did in the previous year. Fentanyl prosecutions 
were up 200 percent. 
Fentanyl and other synthetics are especially deadly. Unless we make progress on 
fentanyl, the gains we are making elsewhere can be overwhelmed. A year ago, the 
Department launched Operation SOS, targeting synthetics in 10 high-impact 
districts. The first year's results are promising, and I plan to ratchet up this 
initiative. 
Obviously, the head of the snake is outside the United States. Most of the illegal 
drugs coming into the country — opioids, cocaine, and meth — are trafficked from 
EFTA00023991
--- PAGE 9 ---
Mexico by transnational organized crime, particularly the Mexican cartels. 
We must destroy these cartels. This is a uniquely Federal responsibility. We have 
destroyed cartels in the past, but we let up so that other groups were able to take 
their place. We cannot do that again. I don't underestimate how hard this work 
is, and how long it will take. 
The successful prosecution of El Chapo was a big step forward. We have to 
capitalize on that. I have asked our agencies to use every tool at our Nation's 
disposal to step up the attack on the cartels. I am hoping that President Trump's 
breakthrough agreement with Mexico on cooperating on the immigration crisis 
will give us an opportunity to work more closely in attacking the cartels. 
In closing, I want to thank you again for all that you do. Thank you for keeping us 
safe where we live and work. Ever since the settlers in Boston established the 
night watch in 1635, America has had a proud tradition of professionals who 
stand guard against those who would do us harm. You are the latest in that noble 
line. 
Please continue to do what you do. This Administration has your back. May God 
bless you and keep you safe. And may God bless the United States of America.

Dear all, 
As=explained, we are instituting a formal litigation hold in connection with Mr. Epstein's death at MCC. You have 
been identified as having done work on or supervised the Epstein matter, and thus as possibly having responsive records. 
Please note and preserve whatever you have about Mr. Epstein, not limited to his death and to the earlier reported 
incident in which he suffered physical injuries. In addition, to the extent possible, please avoid altering any relevant 
records. If you need to use existing documents, please save what you're working off of as a new document so that the 
version that now exists remains preserved and available. 
I attach a formal litigation hold notice, which as required is on an EOUSA-provided form. Please review the notice, fill out 
the form to indicate whether and where you have responsive records, and sign and return it to me. In particular, be sure 
to let me know by USAO number if possible what records and share directories we have that are likely to include relevant 
information. 
I prefer scanned and emailed return of the forms, but you can also use interoffice mail if you prefer. 
Please let me know if you think other USAO personnel may have relevant documents or evidence. 
And please let me know if you have questions or want to discuss. 
Finally, I am copying -to 
inform him of the new litigation hold, and to ask him to ensure that all responsive 
information on our electronic record systems is preserved, including by suspending the routine maintenance email 
deletions for recipients of this email. 
Many thanks,

Please be advised that, by and through this Notice, we, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of 
New York ("USAO"), are hereby instituting a "litigation Hold" in light of a request emailed by representatives of Jeffrey 
Epstein for the preservation of all documents and evidence relating to or potentially shedding light on the circumstances 
of his incarceration and of his recent death at the Metropolitan Correctional Center ("MCC"). S ecificall , the family's 
represenatives request as follows: "Mr. Epstein's family has asked me to send to you and 
t the MCC a 
request for the preservation of any and all documents, records, reports, videos, pictures, physical evidence, electronic 
communication data, tape recordings, logs, notes, papers, emails and any and all other forms of information that would 
be in the possession of the MCC, its Warden, their legal counsel, the USMS, the FBI, the Inspector General, the USAO for

since July 6, 2019 and that relate particularly but not exclusively to the July 23, 2019 occurrence which was investigated 
as an attempted suicide by the MCC and the events relating to his death on August 10, 2019. The request encompasses 
but is not limited to any videos of the 9th floor area in the proximity of his cell during the evening of August 9 through 
the time Mr. Epstein was taken out of his cell for the last time on August 10, 2019, or videos of the cell itself during that 
time period, records of the identities of (i.e. MCC employees or independent contractors or anyone else) who were on 
duty from midnight through 8 AM on August 10, 2019 or otherwise had access to the 9th floor unit where Mr. Epstein 
was incarcerated during this time period, records of any observations of Mr. Epstein on August 9-10, 2019, any and all

morning of August 10, 2019.... In short, the family requests a preservation and production of any and all records and 
documents relevant to his detention, treatment, and death." I am sending this notice and requesting the suspension of 
routine email and ESI deletions from all persons
as identified as potentially involved in such 
investigations or possessing such records. Each recipient should respond by informing me of the USAO number of any 
investigation or matter that falls within the ambit of the request for preservation; we may choose to create backup, 
preserved copies of relevant shared directories and/or to take other steps to preserve pertinent data. Please do not 
discard or delete any potentially responsive records; detailed instructions follow. 
To institute this Litigation Hold, we are implementing preservation procedures regarding any and all records, data, or 
other information, whether they exist in paper form or as electronically stored information ("ESI"), within the USAO's 
possession, custody or control relating to the Complaint/Claims (collectively, "Information"). The USAO's obligation to 
preserve this Information pertains not only to paper copies, or "hard copies" (whether in draft or final, partial or 
complete, versions►, but also to ESI in its originally-created, or "native" format, as it exists on any computer system 
(whether it be on the USAO's system or your personal computer), as well as removable or portable electronic storage 
media. Specific examples of Information subject to this Litigation Hold include, but are not limited to, e-mails and other 
electronic communications, word processing documents, records, spreadsheets, databases, calendars, telephone logs, 
internet usa e files, network access information, and information on other kinds of media, includin PDAs (such as Palm

maintained, the USAO's Lit Hold Coordinator and Systems Manager must coordinate with all those who may have such 
Information. We therefore require your assistance to both identify and preserve any and all Information relating to the 
Complaint/Claims, whether or not the Information is ultimately discoverable. Furthermore, we must confirm that you 
understand and accept your preservation obligations under this Litigation Hold. 
Accordingly, you are required to take the two following steps: (1) Identify to us all such Information and where it resides 
(in Section II below); and (2) Certify having received notice of this Litigation Hold and understanding and accepting your 
preservation obligations under this Litigation Hold (in Section III below). [NOTE: While seeking to identify all such 
Information, please refrain to the maximum extent possible from opening emoils/files you believe to be relevant.]

Thank you for your letter of August 10, 2019 regenfing the death of Jeffrey Epstein. Mr. 
Epstein's death is a tragedy to everyone involved in his case. 
One open question. among others, is whether the investigations referenced in your letter 
will include the incident at MCC involving Mr. Epstein on or about July 23. 2019. To my 
knowledge, it has never been definitively explained what the BOP concluded about that incident.

Emails leaked to the Daily Mail, relayed to 
Parliament, Alleging Blackmail by Jeffrey 
Epstein 
Mark Taylor made this Freedom of Information request to House of Commons 
followers 
Currently waiting for a response from House of Commons they should respond promptly and 
normally no later than 5 September 2019 (details).
Mark Taylor 7 August 2019 
Unknown 
Dear House of Commons, 
This may have to be directed to the Treasury Select Committee, or the information could be found in 
the email archive of John Mann or Mark Gamier held by Parliament. 
On 2nd Nov 2015, The Times reported that the Daily Mail had been leaked emails from Jeffrey Epstein 
to Parliament or some connected source to blackmail Parliament into accepting Jes Staley as CEO for 
Barclays. Subsequently in August 2019 it was reported by Bloomberg that Staley had visited Epstein in 
prison and also on his island, travelling to the latter on Epstein's yacht. 
URL for the Times article is here: 
https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/mps-e...
In the Daily Mail article John Mann MP and Mark Gamier MP were reported to have told the Daily Mail 
that Staley ought to face a grilling session as a result of the threats Epstein was alleged to have made 
to blackmail Parliament to accept his friend Staley as CEO of Barclays. 
1. I would like a copy of any email disclosed to Parliament by the Daily Mail that forms the basis of 
these allegations 
2. The recipient list of the emails, and any other meta data in the original copies sent to Parliament or 
the Treasury Select Committee or its members. 
Yours faithfully,

Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
On behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we will be filing the following reply 
memoranda with accompanying exhibits: 
I. Reply Memorandum in Support of Motion to Dismiss the Superseding Indictment for 
Breach of the Non-Prosecution Agreement 
2. Reply Memorandum in Support of Motion to Dismiss Counts One through Four of 
the Superseding Indictment as Time-Barred 
3. Reply Memorandum in Support of Motion Under the Due Process Clause to Suppress 
All Evidence Obtained from the Government's Subpoena to 
and to 
Dismiss Counts Five and Six 
4. Reply Memorandum in Support of Motion to Dismiss Counts Five and Six of the 
Superseding Indictment Because the Alleged Misstatements Are Not Perjurious as a 
Matter of Law 
5. Reply Memorandum in Support of Motion for a Severance of and Separate Trial on 
Counts Five and Six of the Superseding Indictment 
6. Reply Memorandum in Support of Motion to Strike Surplusage from the Superseding 
Indictment 
7. Reply Memorandum in Support of Motion to Dismiss Counts One Through Six of the 
Superseding Indictment for Pre-Indictment Delay 
8. Reply Memorandum in Support of Motion to Dismiss Either Count One or Count 
Three of the Superseding Indictment as Multiplicitous 
9. Reply Memorandum in Support of Motion to Dismiss the Superseding Indictment as 
It Was Obtained in Violation of the Sixth Amendment 
10. Reply Memorandum in Support of Motion for a Bill of Particulars and Pretrial 
Disclosures

II. Reply Memorandum in Support of Motion Under the Fourth Amendment, Martindell, 
and the Fifth Amendment to Suppress All Evidence Obtained from the Government's 
Subpoena to 
and to Dismiss Counts Five and Six 
12. Reply Memorandum in Support of Motion to Dismiss Counts One through Four of 
the Superseding Indictment for Lack of Specificity 
Several of the reply memoranda reference or discuss Confidential Information produced 
in discovery and are therefore redacted pursuant to paragraph 15 of the Protective Order (Dkt. 
36). In order to give the government the chance to review the proposed redactions, we will not 
file on the public docket any reply memoranda that contain redactions until we are instructed to 
do so by the Court.' 
The remaining reply memoranda do not contain any redactions. 
However, we are 
mindful of the fact that the government's Omnibus Memorandum in Opposition to the 
Defendant's Pre-trial Motions, to which the reply memoranda respond, has not yet been filed on 
the public docket. Accordingly, we will also refrain from filing the reply memoranda that do not 
contain redactions on the public docket until we are instructed to do so by the Court. 
Instead, we will submit by email to the Court and the government all of the reply 
memoranda and exhibits pursuant to Rule 2(B) of the Court's individual rules of criminal 
practice. For the reply memoranda and exhibits that contain redactions, we will submit two 
versions — an unredacted original to be kept under seal and a version for public filing with 
proposed redactions. 
Please contact us with any questions. Your consideration is greatly appreciated. 
Respectfully submitted, 
Is/ Christian R. Everdell

I For documents that the government has designated as "Confidential," we have preliminarily indicated that they be 
filed under seal, as required by paragraph 15 of the Protective Order. However, because some of the exhibits are 
"judicial documents," we intend to propose that those "Confidential" designations be amended consistent with our 
March 9, 2021 letter to the Court.

Team, I just received a call on my desk line from a woman named 
who identified herself as a former 
client of 
and said she was a former victim of Jeffrey Epstein. I asked if her attorney had been in touch with 
either the prosecutors or the case agents, since we had previously contacted him, and she said she believed he had not 
been. She said she had been in touch with an NYPD detective but had not heard back in some time. She said 
represented her for purposes of the Victim Fund, but was not currently representing her. She provided her cell phone as 
She did not provide any substantive information on the call, and I did not ask for any. I advised that 
someone would follow up with her, hopefully in the next week or so. The call lasted less than three minutes. 
For context, we were in touch with Mr. 
several times in 2020 when he claimed to represent at least nine Epstein 
victims, all of which he said were unwilling to speak with us. He subsequently said one victim might be willing to speak 
with us, but then stopped responding to our requests for the complaints he had purportedly filed (but which we couldn't 
find online). I believe the last communication we had with him was the attached.

Just want to put an issue on your radar. As you may recall, we paid a vendor to scan the SDFL Epstein file in October, and 
we are hopeful that it will be loaded into Relativity by the end of March (the delay was unfortunate, but we're hopeful 
PAE can make it happen soon). In order to meet pretrial disclosure deadlines, we need to review the file (which we 
understand to be 30k documents) to determine what has already been produced. We have recruited 4 paralegals and an 
intern in PC to help conduct this review, and have requested an additional 3-4 paralegals from Darcy to assist. The 
deadline is the end of April, so the team has about a month to complete the review. 
Happy to discuss any further if you have any questions. 
Thanks very much,

Please see attached pdf for the National Enquirer's FOIA request concerning 
the investigation and prosecution of financier Jeffrey Epstein in 2005 and 
2006 for crimes relating to sexual trafficking of minors. 
This request has been the subject of the request is of widespread and 
exceptional media interest and the information sought involves possible 
questions about the government's integrity which affects public confidence. 
Specifically; the issue of whether Mr. Epstein's wealth and connections 
secured him favorable treatment by the DOJ. 
Given that a civil defamation trial between one of Epstein'S victims and his 
alleged co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell, has just begun, the topic is of 
renewed interest to the public and therefore is worthy of expedited 
processing.

Dear Sir or Madam, 
I am a reporter and editor for The National Enquirer. I request records under the provisions 
of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C.§ 552. 
Request 
The Enquirer seeks all documents relating to the FBI's investigation and prosecution of 
financier Jeffrey Edward Epstein, who pled guilty to one count of felony solicitation of 
prostitution in August 2006. 
Back ground 
Jeffrey Epstein is a billionaire financier, philanthropist, and sex offender. In 2005, Epstein 
became the subject of an undercover sex trafficking investigation by Palm Beach, Florida 
police and the FBI. Dozens of underage women claimed that they had been trafficked by 
Epstein to perform sexual acts on him as well as his friends. 
Many prominent political figures have been connected to Mr. Epstein's child-trafficking 
ring, including former President Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew of the British Royal

Despite the gravity of his offenses, the Department of Justice agreed to allow Epstein to 
plead guilty to a single count of soliciting prostitution from an underage girl under Florida 
state law, and served only 13 months in prison. In addition, prosecutors agreed not to bring 
charges against Epstein's alleged co-conspirators.

Papers filed in a 2006 lawsuit alleged that Epstein surreptitiously recorded sexual activity 
between prominent individuals and underage girls for purposes of blackmail, leaving many 
to wonder whether potential blackmail material played a role in his light sentence:

Expedited Processing 
This request has been the subject of the request is of widespread and exceptional media 
interest and the information sought involves possible questions about the governments 
integrity which affects public confidence. Specifically; the issue of whether Mr. Epstein's 
wealth and connections secured him favorable treatment by the DOJ. 
Given the a civil defamation trial between one of Epstein's victims and his alleged co-
conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell, is about to begin, the topic is of renewed interest to the 
public and therefore is worthy of expedited processing.

FBI FACT SHEET 
• 
The primary functions of the FBI are national security and law enforcement. 
• 
The FBI does not keep a file on every citizen of the United States. 
• 
The FBI was not established until 1908 and we have very few records prior to the 1920s. 
• 
FBI files generally contain reports of FBI investigations of a wide range of matters, including counterterrorism, 
counter-intelligence, cyber crime, public corruption, civil rights, organized crime, white collar crime, major thefts, 
violent crime, and applicants. 
• 
The FBI does not issue clearances or non-clearances for anyone other than its own personnel or persons 
having access to FBI facilities. Background investigations for security clearances are conducted by many 
different Government agencies. Persons who received a clearance while in the military or employed with some 
other government agency should contact that entity. Most government agencies have websites which are 
accessible on the internet which have their contact information. 
• 
An identity history summary check or "rap sheet" is NOT the same as an "FBI file." It is a listing of 
information taken from fingerprint cards and related documents submitted to the FBI in connection with arrests, 
federal employment, naturalization or military service. The subject of a "rap sheet" may obtain a copy by 
submitting a written request to FBI CJIS Division — Summary Request, 1000 Custer Hollow Road, Clarksburg, WV 
26306. Along with a specific written request, the individual must submit a new full set of his/her fingerprints in 
order to locate the record, establish positive identification, and ensure that an individual's records are not 
disseminated to an unauthorized person. The fingerprint submission must include the subject's name, date and 
place of birth. There is a required fee of $18 for this service, which must be submitted by money order or 
certified check made payable to the Treasury of the United States. A credit card payment option is also 
available. Forms for this option and additional directions may be obtained by accessing the FBI Web site at 
www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/identity-history-summary-checks. 
• 
The National Name Check Program (NNCP) conducts a search of the FBI's Universal Index (UNI) to identify 
any information contained in FBI records that may be associated with an individual and provides the results of that 
search to a requesting federal, state or local agency. Names are searched in a multitude of combinations and 
phonetic spellings to ensure all records are located. The NNCP also searches for both -main" and "cross 
reference" files. A main file is an entry that carries the name corresponding to the subject of a file, while a cross 
reference is merely a mention of an individual contained in a file. The results from a search of this magnitude 
can result in several "hits" and "idents" on an individual. In each instance where UNI has identified a name 
variation or reference, information must be reviewed to determine if it is applicable to the individual in question. 
• 
The Record/Information Dissemination Section (RIDS) searches for records and provides copies of FBI files 
responsive to Freedom of Information or Privacy Act (FOIPA) requests for information. RIDS provides 
responsive documents to requesters seeking "reasonably described information." For a FOIPA search, the 
subject's name, event, activity, or business is searched to determine whether there is an associated investigative 
file. This is called a "main file search" and differs from the NNCP search.

FBI FOIPA Addendum 
As referenced in our letter, the FBI FOIPA Addendum includes information applicable to your request. Part 1 of the 
Addendum includes standard responses that apply to all requests. If you submitted a request regarding yourself or another 
person, Part 2 includes additional standard responses that apply to requests for individuals. If you have questions regarding 
the standard responses in Parts 1 or 2, visit the www.fbi.govlfoia website under "Contact Us." Previously mentioned appeal 
and dispute resolution services are also available. Part 3 includes general information about FBI records that you may find 
useful. 
Part 1: Standard Responses to All Requests: See Below for all Requests 
U.S.C. § 552(c). Congress excluded three categories of law enforcement and national security records from the 
requirements of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). See 5 U.S. C. § 552(c) (2006 & Supp. IV (2010). FBI responses 
are limited to those records subject to the requirements of the FOIA. Additional information about the FBI and the FOIPA 
can be found on the fbi.gov website. 
(ii) 
National Security/Intelligence Records. The FBI can neither confirm nor deny the existence of national security and 
foreign intelligence records pursuant to FOIA exemptions (b)(1) and (b)(3) and PA exemption (j)(2) as applicable to requests 
for records about individuals (5 U.S.C. §§ 552/552a (b)(1), (b3), and (j)(2); 50 U.S.0 § 3024(1)(1)j. The mere 
acknowledgment of the existence or nonexistence of such records is itself a classified fact protected by FOIA exemption (b)(1) 
and/or would reveal intelligence sources, methods, or activities protected by exemption (b)(3): 50 USC § 3024(i)(1). This is 
a standard response and should not be read to indicate that national security or foreign intelligence records do or do not 
exist. 
Part 2: Standard Responses to Requests for Individuals: See Below for all Requests for Individuals 
(i) 
Requests for Records about any Individual—Watch Lists. 
The FBI can neither confirm nor deny the existence of 
any individual's name on a watch list pursuant to FOIA exemption (b)(7)(E) and PA exemption (j)(2) 
U.S.C. §§ 
552/552a (b)(7)(E), OM. This is a standard response and should not be read to indicate that watch list records do or 
do not exist. 
(ii) 
Requests for Records for Incarcerated Individuals. The FBI can neither confirm nor deny the existence of records 
which could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any incarcerated individual pursuant to 
FOIA exemptions (b)(7)(E) and (b)(7)(F) and PA exemption ()(2) [5 U.S.C. §§ 552/552a (bX7)(E), (b)(7)(F), and (j)(2)). 
This is a standard response and should not be read to indicate that such records do or do not exist. 
Part 3: General Information: 
(i) 
Record Searches. The Record/Information Dissemination Section (RIDS) searches for reasonably described records by 
searching those systems or locations where responsive records would reasonably be found. Most requests are satisfied by 
searching the Central Record System (CRS), an extensive system of records consisting of applicant, investigative, 
intelligence, personnel, administrative, and general files compiled and maintained by the FBI in the course of fulfilling its 
dual law enforcement and intelligence mission as well as the performance of agency administrative and personnel 
functions. The CRS spans the entire FBI organization and encompasses the records of FBI Headquarters ("FBIHQ"), FBI 
Field Offices, and FBI Legal Attache Offices ("Legats") worldwide. A CRS search includes Electronic Surveillance (ELSUR) 
records. 
(ii) 
FBI Records 
Founded in 1908, the FBI carries out a dual law enforcement and national security mission. As part of this dual mission, 
the FBI creates and maintains records on various subjects; however, the FBI does not maintain records on every person, 
subject, or entity. 
(iii) 
Requests for Criminal History Records or "Rap Sheets." The Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Division 
provides Identity History Summary Checks —often referred to as a criminal history record or 'rap sheets: These 
criminal history records are not the same as material in an investigative "FBI file." An Identity History Summary Check 
is a listing of information taken from fingerprint cards and documents submitted to the FBI in connection with arrests, 
federal employment, naturalization, or military service. For a fee, individuals can request a copy of their Identity History 
Summary Check. Forms and directions can be accessed at www.fbi.govtabout-us/cjistidentity-history-summary-checks. 
Additionally, requests can be submitted electronically at www.edo.ciis.qov. For additional information, please contact 
CJIS directly at (304) 625-5590. 
The National Name Check Program (NNCP). The mission of NNCP is to analyze and report information in response to name check 
requests received from federal agencies, for the purpose of protecting the United States from foreign and domestic threats to national 
security. Please be advised that this is a service provided to other federal agencies. Private citizens cannot request a name check.

DATE FILED: 3124/21 
20-CR-330 (MN) 
ORDER 
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
On March 5, 2021, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell submitted to the Court an application 
for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to Rule 17(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal 
Procedure. The proposed subpoena was directed at a law firm that represents alleged victims of 
the Defendant. As is standard for Rule 17(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and 
under seal on the ground that it reveals defense strategy. See e.g., United States v. Skelos, No. 
15-CR-317 (KMW), 2018 WL 2254538, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. May 17, 2018), aff'd, 988 F.3d 645 (2d 
Cir. 2021); United States v. Wey, 252 F. Supp. 3d 237, 243 (S.D.N.Y. 2017); United States v. 
Earls, No. 03-CR-0364 (NRB), 2004 WL 350725, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 25, 2004); United States 
v. Reyes, 162 F.R.D. 468, 470 (S.D.N.Y. 1995). 
Rule 17(c)(3) provides that "[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the 
production of personal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party 
only by court order," but "before entering the order and unless there are exceptional 
circumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can move to 
quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object." Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(3). Consistent with 
the Rule, on March 12, 2021, in a sealed ex pane Order, the Court required defense counsel to 
provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or confidential information may be disclosed 
EFTA00024166
--- PAGE 2 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 172 Filed 03/24/21 Page 2 of 3 
by the proposed subpoena. The Court also gave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or 
request modifications of the subpoena as required by Rule 17(c)(3). 
On March 19, 2021, the Court received a letter from the law firm indicating that it can 
provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or confidential information may be elicited by 
the subpoena. The law firm shall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. 
In that letter, the law firm also interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm 
and the alleged victims it represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a 
motion to quash, even though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive 
adversarial briefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm 
shall enter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v. Ray, 
No. 20-CR-110 (LJL), 2020 WL 6939677, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2020) ("[I]f the Court 
determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential information about a victim, it 
requires the requesting party have given notice to the victim before it permits the service of the 
subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court will then determine whether to modify or quash the 
subpoena, including on grounds that Nixon was not satisfied."). 
In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the law firm shall meet and confer with 
defense counsel to see if any issues can be narrowed before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to 
filing, the law firm shall confer with defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored 
redactions to the objections. The law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be 
filed on or before March 26, 2021. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v. 
Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Within one week of the filing of 
objections, defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm may reply

Abstract 
Identifying and understanding factors that promote or inhibit child sexual abuse (CSA) disclosures has the potential to facilitate 
earlier disclosures, assist survivors to receive services without delay, and prevent further sexual victimization. Timely access to 
therapeutic services can mitigate risk to the mental health of survivors of all ages. This review of the research focuses on CSA 
disdosures with children, youth, and adults across the life course. Using Kiteley and Stogdon's literature review framework. 33 
studies since 2000 were identified and analyzed to extrapolate the most convincing findings to be considered for practice and 
future research. The centering question asked: What is the state of CSA disclosure research and what can be learned to apply to 
practice and future research? Using Braun and Clarke's guidelines for thematic analysis. five themes emerged: (I) Disclosure is an 
iterative, interactive process rather than a discrete event best done within a relational context; (2) contemporary disclosure 
models reflect a social—ecological, person-in-environment orientation for understanding the complex interplay of individual, 
familial, contextual, and cultural factors involved in CA disclosure; (3) age and gender significantly influence disclosure; (4) there 
is a lack of a life-course perspective; and (5) barriers to disclosure continue to outweigh facilitators. Although solid strides have 
been made in understanding CSA disclosures, the current state of knowledge does not fully capture a cohesive picture of dis. 
dosure processes and pathways over the life course. More research is needed on environmental. contextual, and cultural factors. 
Barriers continue to be identified more frequently than facilitators, although dialogical forums are emerging as important facil-
itators of CSA disclosure. Implications for practice in facilitating CSA disclosures are discussed with recommendations for future 
research.

Introduction 
Timely access to supportive and therapeutic resources for child 
sexual abuse (CSA) survivors can mitigate risk to the health 
and mental health well-being of children, youth, and adults. 
Identifying and understanding factors that promote or inhibit 
CSA disclosures have the potential to facilitate earlier disclo-
sures, assist survivors to receive services without delay, and 
potentially prevent further sexual victimization. Increased 
knowledge on both the factors and the processes involved in 
CSA disclosures is timely when research continues to show 
high rates of delayed disclosures (Collin-VEzina, Sablonni, 
Palmer, & Milne, 2015; Crisma, Bascelli, Paci, & Romito, 
2004; Easton, 2013; Goodman-Brown, Edelstein, Goodman, 
Jones, & Gordon, 2003; Hershkowitz, Lanes, & Lamb; 2007; 
Jonzon & Lindblad, 2004; McElvaney, 2015; Smith et al., 
2000). 
Incidence studies in the United States and Canada report 
decreasing CSA rates (Fallon et al., 2015; Finkelhor, Shattuck, 
Turner, & Hamby, 2014; Trocme et al., 2005, 2008), while at 
the same time global trends from systematic reviews and meta-
analyses have found concerning rates of CSA, with averages of 
18-20% for females and of 8-10% for males (Pereda, Guilera, 
Fours, & Gomez-Benito, 2009). The highest rates found for 
girls is in Australia (21.5%) and for boys in Africa (19.3%), 
with the lowest rates for both girls (11.3%) and boys (4.1%) 
reported in Asia (Stoltenborgh, van Uzendoorn, Euser, & 
Bakermans-Kranenburg, 20 I 1). These findings point to the 
incongruence between the low number of official reports of

CSA to authorities and the high rates reported in prevalence 
studies. For example, a meta-analysis conducted by Stolten-
borgh, van LIzendoom, Euser, and Bakermans-Kranenburg 
(2011) combining estimations of CSA in 217 studies published 
between 1980 and 2008 revealed rates of CSA to be more than 
times greater in studies relying on self-reports (127 in 1,000) 
than in official report inquiries, such as those based on data 
from child protection services and the police (4 in 1,000) (Ju-
lian, Cotter, & Perreault, 2014; Statistics Canada 2013). In 
other words, while 1 out of 8 people retrospectively report 
having experienced CSA, official incidence estimates indicate 
only 1 per 250 children. In a survey of Swiss child services, 
Maier, Mohler-Kuo, Landholt, Schnyder, and Jud (2013) fur-
ther found 2.68 cases per 1,000 of CSA disclosures, while in a 
recent comprehensive review McElvaney (2015) details the 
high prevalence of delayed, partial, and nondisclosures in 
childhood indicating a persistent trend toward withholding 
CSA disclosure. 
It is our view that incidence statistics are likely an under-
estimation of CSA disclosures, and this drives the rationale for 
the current review. Given the persistence of delayed disclosures 
with research showing a large number of survivors only dis-
closing in adulthood (Collin-Vezina et al., 2015; Easton, 2013; 
Hunter, 2011; McElvaney, 2015; Smith et al., 2000), these 
issues should be a concern for practitioners, policy makers, and 
the general public (McElvaney, 2015). The longer disclosures 
are delayed, the longer individuals potentially live with serious 
negative effects and mental health problems such as depres-
sion, anxiety, trauma disorders, and addictions, without receiv-
ing necessary treatment. This also increases the likelihood of 
more victims falling prey to undetected offenders. Learning 
more about CSA disclosure factors and processes to help 
advance our knowledge base may help professionals to facil-
itate earlier disclosures. 
Previous literature reviews examining factors influencing 
CSA disclosure have served the field well but are no longer 
current. Important contributions on CSA disclosures include 
Paine and Hansen's (2002) original review covering the liter-
ature largely from the premillennium era, followed by London, 
Bruck, Ceci, and Shuman's (2005) subsequent review, which 
may not have captured publications affected by "lag to print" 
delays so common in peer-reviewed journals. These reviews 
are now dated and therefore do not take into account the 
plethora of research that has been accumulated over the past 
years. Other recent reviews exist but with distinct contribu-
tions on the dialogical relational processes of disclosure (Reit-
sema & Grietens, 2015), CSA disclosures in adulthood (Tener 
& Murphy, 2015), and delayed disclosures in childhood (McEl-
vaney, 20I5). This literature review differs by focusing on CSA 
disclosures in children, youth, and adults from childhood and 
into adulthood—over the life course. 
Method 
Kiteley and Stogdon's (2014) systematic review framework 
was utilized to establish what has been investigated in CSA 
disclosure research, through various mixed methods, to high-
light the most convincing findings that should be considered for 
future research, practice, and program planning. This review 
centered on the question: What is the state of CSA disclosure 
research and what can be learned to apply to future research 
and practice? By way of clarification, the term systematic 
refers to a methodologically sound strategy for searching liter-
ature on studies for knowledge construction, in this case the 
CSA disclosure literature, rather than intervention studies. The 
years spanned for searching the literature were 2000-2016, 
building on previous reviews without a great deal of overlap. 
Retrieval of relevant research was done by searching interna-
tional electronic databases: PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, Edu-
cational Resources Information Center, Canadian Research 
Index, International Bibliography of the Social Sciences, Pub-
lished International Literature on Traumatic Stress, Sociologi-
cal Abstracts, Social Service Abstracts, and Applied Social 
Science Index and Abstracts. This review searched peer-
reviewed studies. A search of the gray literature (unpublished 
literature such as internal agency documents, government 
reports, etc.) was beyond the scope of this review because 
unpublished studies are not subjected to a peer-review process. 
Keyword search terms used were child sexual abuse, childhood 
sexual abuse, disclosure, and telling. 
A search of the 9 databases produced 322 peer-reviewed 
articles. Selected search terms yielded 200 English publica-
tions, I French study, and 1 Portuguese review. The search was 
further refined by excluding studies focusing on forensic inves-
tigations, as these studies constitute a specialized legal focus on 
interview approaches and techniques. As well, papers that 
focused exclusively on rates and responses to CSA disclosure 
were excluded, as these are substantial areas unto themselves, 
exceeding the aims of the review question. Review articles 
were also excluded. Once the exclusion criteria were applied, 
the search results yielded 33 articles. These studies were sub-
jected to a thematic analysis as described by Braun and Clarke 
(2006). This entailed (I) multiple readings by the three authors; 
(2) identifying patterns across studies by coding and charting 
specific features; (3) examining disclosure definitions used, 
sample characteristics, and measures utilized; and (4) major 
findings were extrapolated. Reading of the articles was initially 
conducted by the authors to identify general trends in a first 
level of analyses and then subsequently to identify themes 
through a deeper second-level analyses. A table of studies was 
generated and was continuously revised as the selection of 
studies was refined (see Table 1). 
Key Findings 
First-level analysis of the studies identified key study charac-
teristics. Trends emerged around definitions of CSA disclosure, 
study designs, and sampling issues. First, in regard to defini-
tions, the term "telling" is most frequently used in place of the 
term disclosure. In the absence of standardized questionnaires 
or disclosure instruments, telling emerges as a practical term 
more readily understood by study participants. Several

TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE 20(2) 
examples of this usage were found in the research questions, 
interview guides, and surveys examined: "How and when do 
people decide to tell others about their early sexual experiences 
with adults?" (Hunter, 2011, p. 161); "Some men take many 
years to tell someone that they were sexually abused. Please 
describe why it may be difficult for men to tell about/discuss 
the sexual abuse" (Easton, Saltzman, & Willis, 2014, p. 462). 
"Participants were asked a series of open-ended questions to 
elicit a narrative regarding their experiences of telling..." 
(McElvaney, Greene, & Hogan, 2012, p. 1160). "Who was the 
first person you told?" (Schaeffer, Leventhal, & Anes, 2011, p. 
346). 
There was sound consistency between studies, defining dis-
closure in multifaceted ways with uniform use of categories of 
prompted, purposeful, withheld, accidental, direct, and indi-
rect. However, defining the period of time that would delineate 
a disclosure as delayed varied widely across studies, wherein 
some studies viewed I week or I month as a delayed disclosure 
(i.e., Hershkowitz et al., 2007; Kogan, 2004; Schembucher, 
Maier, Moher-Kuo, Schnyder, & Lamdolt, 2012). Other studies 
simply reported average years of delay sometimes as long as 
from 20 to 46 years (Easton, 2013; Jonzon & Linblad, 2004; 
Smith et al., 2000). 
Second, the number of qualitative studies has increased sig-
nificantly over the last 15 years. This rise is in response to a 
previous dearth of qualitative studies. Based on Jones's (2000) 
observation that disclosure factors and outcomes had been well 
documented through quantitative methods; in a widely read 
editorial, he recommended "Qualitative studies which are able 
to track the individual experiences of children and their percep-
tion of the influences upon them which led to their disclosure of 
information are needed to complement ... " (p. 270). 
Third, although a few studies strived to obtain representative 
samples in quantitative investigations (Hershkowitz, Horowitz, 
& Lamb, 2005; Kogan, 2004; Smith et al., 2000), sampling was 
for the most part convenience based, relying on voluntary par-
ticipation in surveys and consent-based participation in file 
reviews (Collings, Griffiths, & Kumalo, 2005; Priebe & Sve-
din, 2008; Schembucher et al., 2012; Ungar, Barter, McConnell, 
Tutty, & Fairholm, 2009a). Therefore, generalizability of find-
ings is understandably limited. The qualitative studies used 
purposive sampling as is deemed appropriate for transferability 
of findings to similar populations. Some of those samples con-
tained unique characteristics, since they were sought through 
counseling centers or sexual advocacy groups. These would be 
considered clinical samples producing results based on disclo-
sures that may have been delayed or problematic. This might 
presumably produce data skewed toward bathers and bring 
fonvard less information on disclosure facilitators. 
Through an in-depth, second-level analysis, this review 
identified five distinct themes and subthemes beyond the gen-
eral trends as noted earlier. 
Theme 1: Disclosure is viewed as an ongoing process as 
opposed to a discrete event—iterative and interactive in 
nature. A subtheme was identified regarding disclosure as 
being facilitated within a dialogical and relational context is 
being more clearly delineated. 
Theme 2: Contemporary disclosure models reflect a 
social—ecological, person-in-environment perspective to 
understand the complex interplay of individual, familial, 
contextual, and cultural factors involved in CSA disclosure. 
Subthemes include new categories of disclosure and a grow-
ing focus on previously missing cultural and contextual 
factors. 
Theme 3: Age and gender are strong predictors for delaying 
disclosure or withholding disclosure with trends showing 
fewer disclosures by younger children and boys. One sub-
theme emerged that intrafamilial abuse/family-like relation-
ship of perpetrator has a bearing on disclosure delays or 
withholding. 
Theme 4: There is a lack of a cohesive life-course perspec-
tive. One subtheme includes the lack of data within the 18-
to 24-year-old emerging adult population. 
Theme 5: Significantly more information is available on 
barriers than on facilitators of CSA disclosure. Subthemes 
of shame, self-blame, and fear are uniformly identified as 
disclosure deterrents. 
Disclosure as an ongoing process: Iterative and interactive in nature. 
Disclosure is now generally accepted as a complex and lifelong 
process, with current trends showing that CSA disclosures are 
too often delayed until adulthood (Collin-Vezina et al., 2015; 
Easton, 2013; Hunter, 2011). Knowledge building about CSA 
disclosure has moved in the direction of understanding this as 
an iterative and interactive process rather than a discrete, one-
time event. Since the new millennium, disclosure is being 
viewed as a dynamic, rather than static, process and described 
"not as a single event but rather a carefully measured process" 
(Alaggia, 2005, p. 455). The catalyst for this view originates 
from Summit (I 983) who initially conceptualized CSA disclo-
sures as process based, although this notion was not fully 
explored until several years later. Examinations of Summit's 
(1983) groundbreaking proposition of the CSA accommodation 
(CSAA) model produced varying results as to whether his five 
stages of secrecy, helplessness, entrapment and accommoda-
tion, delayed, conflicted, and unconvincing disclosures, and 
retraction or recantation, hold validity (for a review, see Lon-
don, Bruck, Ceci, & Shuman, 2005). However, the idea of 
disclosure as a process has been carried over into contemporary 
thinking. 
Recently, McElvaney, Greene, and Hogan (2012) detailed a 
process model of disclosure wherein they describe an interac-
tion of internal factors with external motivators which they 
liken to a "pressure cooker" effect, preceded by a period of 
containment of the secret. Moreover, this and other studies 
strongly suggest disclosures are more likely to occur within a 
dialogical context—activated by discussions of abuse or pre-
vention forums providing information about sexual abuse 
(Hershkowitz et al., 2005; Jensen, Gulbrandsen, Mossige, 
Reichelt, & Tjersland, 2005; Ungar et al., 2009a). The term

dialogical simply means to participate in dialogue. Key dialo-
gical vehicles identified in these studies were providing sexual 
abuse information through prevention programs, being asked 
about sexual abuse, and being prompted to tell (McElvaney 
et al., 2012; Ungar et al., 2009a). 
Contemporary models of CSA disclosure reflect a social cological 
perspective. Knowledge on CSA disclosure has been steadily 
advancing toward a holistic understanding of the complex 
interplay of individual, familial, contextual, and cultural fac-
tors (Alaggia & Kirshenbaum, 2005; Brazelton, 2015; Fontes 
& Plummer, 2010). Where at one time factors examined and 
identified were predominantly of intrapersonal factors of child 
victims, knowledge construction has shifted to fuller social—
ecological, person-in-environment explanations (Alaggia, 
2010; Collin-Vezina et al., 2015; Easton et al., 2014; Hunter, 
2011; Ungar, Tutty, McConnell, Barter, & Fairholm, 2009b). 
Social-ecological explanations open up more opportunities to 
intervene in facilitating earlier disclosures. Alaggia (2010) pro-
poses an ecological mapping of what individual, interpersonal, 
environmental, and contextual influences impede or promote 
CSA disclosures based on analysis of in-depth interview data of 
adult survivors. Subsequently, based on a sample of 67 adult 
survivors, Collin-Vezina, Sablonni, Palmer, and Milne (2015) 
identified three broad categories, closely aligned with an eco-
logical framework that impede CSA disclosure: (1) barriers 
from within, (2) barriers in relation to others, and (3) bathers 
in relation to the social world which can be aligned to intra-
personal, interpersonal, and contextual factors. 
A summary of knowledge building using a social—ecologi-
cal framework follows. Knowledge gained in the intrapersonal 
domain includes expanded conceptualization of disclosure by 
building on previous categories of accidental, purposeful, and 
prompted disclosure to also include behavioral and indirect 
attempts to tell, intentionally withheld disclosure, and triggered 
and recovered memories (Alaggia, 2004). Categories of indi-
rect behavioral disclosure patterns have been further verified in 
follow-up research by Hunter (2011), and through an extensive 
file review that used Alaggia's (2004) disclosure framework to 
analyze their data (Collings et al., 2005) for verification. 
Interpersonal factors have also emerged in regard to certain 
family characteristics as disclosure barriers. Families with 
rigidly fixed gender roles, patriarchal attitudes, power imbal-
ances, other forms of child abuse and domestic violence, chao-
tic family structure, dysfunctional communication, and social 
isolation have been found to suppress disclosure (Alaggia 
Kirshenbaum, 2005; Collin-Vezina et al., 2015; Fontes & 
Plummer, 2010). In addition, relationship with perpetrator is 
a factor whereby research indicates that disclosure is made 
more difficult when the perpetrator is a family member or close 
to the family (Dumont, Messerschmitt, Vila, Bohu, & Rey-
Salmon, 20 I 4;Easton, 2013; Goodman-Brown et al., 2003; 
Hershkowitz et al., 2005; Priebe & Svedin, 2008; Schanbucher 
et al., 2012). This is especially a barrier when the perpetrator 
lives with the victim (LeClerc & Wortley, 2015). 
In terms of environmental factors, one study revealed that 
neighborhood/community conditions can hinder disclosure 
when there is lack of school involvement in providing a sup-
portive environment, such as in following up on troubling stu-
dent behavior (Alaggia, 2010). Additionally, a child victim's 
anticipation of a negative response to disclosure, especially that 
they may not be believed by others outside their family such as 
neighbors or other community members, has shown to deter 
disclosure (Collin-Vezina et al., 2015). 
Cultural factors influencing CSA disclosure have been stud-
ied to a much lesser degree. Despite this, a few important 
studies examining critical sociocultural factors now exist for 
better understanding CSA disclosure within a cultural context 
(Brazelton, 2015; Fontes & Plummer, 2010). Among these 
important contributions, Brazelton's (2015) research has deli-
neated CSA disclosure processes as "shaped by relational, 
racial, socio-cultural, historical, and developmental factors" 
(p. 182). In a unique study using culturally focused research 
literature as data triangulated with clinical case material, cul-
turally based belief systems in many cultures have been found 
to foster family climates that can silence children from disclos-
ing abuse (Fontes & Plummer, 2010). Taboos about sexuality, 
patriarchal attitudes, and devaluation of women are among 
some of the cultural barriers that inhibit disclosure (Fontes & 
Plummer, 2010). 
Clearly, disclosure conceptualizations are being integrated 
into a social—ecological model of individual and developmental 
factors, family dynamics, neighborhood, and community con-
text as well as cultural and societal attitudes toward better 
understanding disclosure barriers and facilitators (Alaggia, 
2010), although more data are needed on cultural and contex-
tual factors. 
Age and gender as predictors of disclosure 
Age. Age is consistently found to be an influential factor in 
CSA disclosure, making the life stage of the victim/survivor a 
critical consideration. Studies draw distinctions in age-groups 
falling into either under or over 18 years of age. Eighteen years 
of age was the common age cutoff point that investigators chose 
in order to distinguish child/youth populations from adult sam-
ples. Sixteen of the studies drew on samples of children and 
youth, while the other 15 studies sampled adults over the age 
of 18, and a further two studies used mixed age-groups (refer to 
Table I). Among the child and youth samples, the age ranges 
spanned from preschool to late adolescence (3-17 years of age), 
with varying methodological approaches implemented across 
age cohorts. For younger cohorts, file reviews and secondary 
data analyses of CSA reports were typically undertaken. Ado-
lescents were most often given surveys. Sometimes children and 
youth were interviewed as part of administering a survey or as a 
follow-up (Crisma et al., 2004; Hershkowitz et al., 2005; Ungar 
et al., 200%). In the majority of child and adolescent samples, 
sexual abuse concerns were already flagged to investigative 
authorities. However, the work of Ungar, Barter, McConnell, 
Tutty, and Fairholm (2009a, 200%) is one exception, whereby 
their survey elicited new disclosures. 
EFTA00024193

TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE 20(2) 
Adult studies typically had a mean age between 40 and 50 
years. Interviews were the main data collection method with a 
few exceptions using survey designs (i.e., Easton, 2013; Kogan, 
2004; Smith et al., 2000) and case file reviews (i.e., Collings 
et al., 2005; Goodman-Brown et al., 2003). Results show a clear 
trend toward increased likelihood of disclosure in older youth, 
and findings from adult samples showing a preponderance of 
disclosures in adulthood, with the large majority of participants 
of adults reporting never having had a sexual abuse complaint 
filed with investigative authorities as a child or an adolescent 
(i.e., Hunter, 2011; Gagnier & Collin-Vezina, 2016; Sorsoli, 
Kia-Keating, & Grossman, 2008; Ungar et al., 200%). 
With children and youth under the ages of 18 distinct 
patterns emerged. First, accidental detection, rather than 
purposeful disclosure, is more likely to occur with younger 
children. For example, in one large-scale study of over 
1,737 file reviews, over half of the CSA-related cases were 
identified through accidental and eyewitness detection (61%), 
while less than one third were purposeful disclosures initiated 
by the child victim (Collings et al., 2005). A second pattern 
which emerged is that rates of disclosure increase with age, 
especially into adulthood, which is supported by persistent 
findings of high rates of delayed disclosure reported later 
in the life course by adult survivors (Collings et al., 2005; 
Collin-Vezina et al., 2015 ; Easton, 2013; Jonzon & Linblad, 
2004; Kogan, 2004; Leclerc & Wortley, 2015; Sorsoli et al., 
2008). While gender and relationship with the perpetrator are 
considerable factors in CSA disclosure, age is consistently a 
stronger predictor of disclosure (or nondisclosure) (Hershko-
witz et al., 2005; Leclerc & Wortley, 2015). Third, younger 
children who disclose are more likely to do so in an interview 
situation or other environment that provides prompts or 
questions about sexual abuse (Hershkowitz et al., 2005; 
McElvaney, Greene, & Hogan, 2014; Schaeffer et al., 
2011), but this trend can also be seen in older youth (Ungar 
et al., 2009a, 2009b). 
Gender. A number of studies have recently focused on CSA 
disclosures with male victims, since males have been an under-
studied population (Alaggia, 2005; Easton, 2013; Easton et al., 
2014; Gagnier & Collin-Vezina, 2016). Most investigations 
that sampled both sexes show females outweighing male parti-
cipants. Although women are at double the risk of being sub-
jected to CSA, the ratio of women to men in most disclosure 
studies has not been representative. This finding may be indi-
cative of male victims more likely delaying disclosing their 
CSA experiences, leaving male disclosure in child and youth 
samples underrepresented (Hebert, Tourigny, Cyr, McDuff, & 
Joly, 2009; Ungar et al., 2009b). 
Easton, Saltzman, and Willis (2014) have been developing 
gender-specific modeling of disclosure examining male disclo-
sures. Their proposed model groups male disclosures into barrier 
categories as determined by individual factors, interpersonal 
issues, and factors that are sociopolitical in nature. These authors 
suggest that predominant gender norms around masculinity rein-
force the tendency for male victims of CSA to blame themselves 
for the abuse, resulting in no disclosure. Male participants in a 
subsequent study also relayed that gender norms and stereotypes 
contributed to them concealing the abuse because they were 
abused by a woman (Gagnier & Collin-Vezina, 2016). In the one 
study that compared male and female disclosures, investigator 
found that men's fears of being viewed as homosexual; profound 
feelings of stigmatization or isolation because of the belief that 
boys are rarely victimized; and fear of becoming an abuser acted 
as disclosure barriers. Whereas females felt more conflicted about 
who was responsible for the abuse and more strongly anticipated 
being blamed and not believed (Alaggia, 2005). 
Lack of a life-course perspective. Given that the study of CSA 
disclosure draws on age-groups ranging from samples of very 
young children to retrospective studies of adult survivors, with 
significant developmental considerations, this area of study 
lacks an intentional cohesive life-course perspective. Most data 
are derived from either cross-sectional or retrospective designs, 
with few longitudinal studies. There are a series of sound, yet 
disconnected, studies focusing on specific age-groups of chil-
dren and adolescents, along with adult retrospective studies. 
Thus, the available knowledge base does not allow for a cohe-
sive picture of CSA disclosure processes and pathways over the 
life course to emerge. 
The life-course perspective has long been recommended as 
a critical lens for the study of child abuse (Browning & Lau-
mann, 1997; Williams, 2003). For example, a life-course per-
spective has been utilized to understand the immediate- and 
long-term effects of CSA on the developing child victim 
(Browning & Laumann, 1997). Further, a life-course perspec-
tive is important in terms of examining age of onset of CSA to 
explain the differential effects of sexual victimization and 
developmental impacts in terms of understanding their ability 
to disclose—effects that need to be understood within a devel-
opmental context, especially for designing appropriate inter-
ventions for disclosure at critical transitions from early 
childhood through to adolescence and into adulthood. In addi-
tion, important "turning points" in life may facilitate disclo-
sures. For example, entry into adulthood given that delayed 
disclosure occurs more often in adulthood. Alaggia (2004, 
2005) found that being in a committed relationship or the birth 
of children acted as facilitators for some survivors to disclose, 
especially to their spouses. These significant life events, as 
contributing to disclosures, bear further examination. 
Summary of barriers and facilitators. Research over the past 15 
years continues to uncover barriers to CSA disclosure at a 
higher frequency than that of facilitators. As stated previously, 
this might be the result of sampling methods whereby partici-
pants who volunteer for disclosure research may have had more 
negative disclosure experiences, especially since many report 
delays in disclosure. The following section outlines the major 
trends in both barriers and facilitators (see Table 2). 
Barriers. Age and gender were found to contribute to barriers 
as covered in Theme 3. Disclosures generally increase with age

Table 2. Factors Influencing Child Sexual Abuse Disclosures. 
Barriers 
Facilitators 
Age: The younger the child victim, the less likely they will purposefully 
disclose. 
Gender: Males may be less likely to disclose in childhood/adolescence, 
fear of being seen as homosexual and as a victim, females experience 
more self blame and anticipation of being blamed and/or not 
believed 
Relationship to perpetrator: If the perpetrator is a family member or in 
a family like role. disclosure is less likely to happen 
Internal: Shame, self blame, and fear are psychological barriers. In 
addition, fear of negative consequences on the family and for self 
safety inhibits disclosure 
Family relations: families with a patriarchal structure, rigidly fixed 
gender roles, dysfunctional communication. other forms of abuse 
(i.e.. domestic violence), and isolation inhibit disclosure 
Environmental and cultural context Lack of discussion about sexuality; 
passive acceptance that unwanted sexual experiences are inevitable; 
not wanting to bring shame to the family by admitting sexual abuse; 
lack of involvement from neighbors. school personnel; and stigma 
perpetuated by societal perceptions 
Age: Disclosures Increase with age. especially in adulthood. 
Gender. Slight trend toward females who are older (adolescent) to 
disclose before adulthood 
Relationship to perpetrator: If the perpetrator is not living with the 
victim, disclosure rates increase 
Dialogical context Opportunities to disclose through discussion. 
therapeutic relationship, information sessions on sexuality, and 
sexual abuse prevention programs 
Family relations: Supportive parent-child relationship. 
Involvement of others: Eyewitnesses coming forward and reporting: 
detection through community members, professionals 
Environmental and cultural context: Promotion of open discussion of 
sexuality; community member involvement 
as children gain more developmental capacity, understanding 
of sexual abuse as victimization, and increased independence. 
Males are somewhat less likely to disclose, but this is often in 
interaction with other factors in the environment such as soci-
etal attitudes that promote hypermasculinity as desirable, atti-
tudes that perpetuate negative views of boys and men who are 
victims, and homophobic attitudes (Alaggia, 2010; Easton 
et al., 2014; Gagnier & Collin-Vezina, 2016). 
Victims of intrafamilial abuse when the offender is a parent, 
caregiver, significant family member, or someone in a family-
like role are less likely to disclose immediately or at all in 
childhood/adolescence because of obvious power differentials 
and dependency needs (Collings et al., 2005; Dumont et al., 
2014; Hershkowitz et al., 2005; Kogan, 2004; Leclerc & Wort-
ley, 2015; Paine & Hansen, 2002; Schaeffer et al., 2011). 
Further, the perpetrator residing with their victim(s) 
increases the likelihood of no disclosure (Leclerc & Wortley, 
2015). 
Internalized victim-blaming, mechanisms to protect oneself 
(such as minimizing the impact of the abuse), and developmen-
tal immaturity at the onset of abuse constituted internal bar-
riers. Further, shame, self-blame, and fear have been identified 
as significant factors deterring disclosure (Collin-Vezina et al., 
2015; Crisma et al., 2004; Goodman-Brown et al., 2003; Hun-
ter, 2011; Kogan, 2004; McElvaney & Culhane, 2015; McEl-
vaney et al., 2014). However, aspects of shame, self-blame and 
fear, and have not been fully explored in research. Since these 
are strong predictors of disclosure suppression, they bear fur-
ther examination in future research to understand more fully 
how they operate in disclosure processes. 
In terms of interpersonal and environmental factors, family 
dynamics can play a part in deterring disclosure. As previously 
mentioned, families characterized by rigidly defined gender 
roles, patriarchal attitudes that perpetuate power imbalances 
between men and women, parents and children, presence of 
other forms of child abuse and/or domestic violence, chaotic 
family structure, dysfunctional communication, and social iso-
lation have been found to suppress disclosure (Alaggia & Kir-
shenbaum, 2005; Collin-Vezina et al., 2015; Fontes & 
Plummer, 2010). In regard to broader environmental factors, 
disclosure can be hindered when involved and supportive com-
munity members are not available, or not trained in sensitive 
responses, or when child victims anticipate not being believed 
by neighbors and other people outside the family (Alaggia, 
2010; Collin-Vezina et al., 2015). Further, barriers in relation 
to the social world were identified as stigmatization, the neg-
ative labeling of sexual abuse victims, and taboos surrounding 
sexuality and talking about sex as driven by cultural norms 
(Collin-Vezina et al., 2015; Fontes & Plummer, 2010). 
Identification of cultural barriers is important recent contri-
bution to understanding disclosure processes—and in particular 
to the obstacles. Findings related to cultural barriers included 
themes of children's voices not being heard leading to silen-
cing, the normalization of the sexualization and objectification 
of girls and women, and the perpetuation of hypermasculinity 
in men—all acting as barriers in terms of stigma to disclosure 
(Alaggia, 2005, 2010; Easton et al., 2014). Brazelton (2015) 
similarly found that lack of discussions about sex, young age at 
the onset of sexual abuse, therefore not having the language to 
express what was happening to them, and preserving the family 
good name by not talking about abuse in the family were also 
barriers to disclosure. 
Finally, it may be the case that more barriers continue to be 
identified over facilitators of CSA disclosure perhaps because 
of the methods employed in studies—particularly those draw-
ing on adult populations who delayed disclosure. These sam-
ples may not be representative of the overall population of CSA 
victims, since they may have had more negative disclosure 
EFTA00024195

280 
TRAUMA, VIOLENCE, & ABUSE 20(2) 
experiences, consequently more readily identifying barriers. 
On the other hand, these findings may speak to the actual 
imbalance between facilitating factors and barriers for disclo-
sure, the latter carrying more weight in the victims/survivors' 
experiences, thus, explaining the high rates of disclosures 
delayed until adulthood. 
Facilitators. Although fewer disclosure facilitators are identi-
fied in this review, very important facilitators were nonetheless 
uncovered—ones that should be noted for professionals in this 
field of practice. Internal factors that facilitate disclosures 
include symptoms that become unbearable, getting older with 
increased developmental efficacy, and realizing that an offence 
was committed (Collin-Vezina et al., 2015; Crisma et al., 2004; 
Easton, 2013; Hershkowitz et al. 2007; McElavaney, Greene, 
& Hogan, 2014; Schaeffer et al., 2011). Circumstantial facil-
itators are those where the child discloses because there has 
been evidence provided, eye-witnessing has occurred, and a 
report has been made. Environmental factors include settings 
that provide opportunities such as counseling, interviews, 
information sessions and educational forumsAvorIcshops, and 
prevention programs for children and youth to disclose. 
To elaborate, dialogical contexts about CSA for children 
and youth can provide opportunities for discussion that may 
facilitate disclosures (Jensen et al., 2005). The research shows 
creating open dialogue in relationship contexts, to offset the 
power and influence of the perpetrator, can facilitate earlier 
disclosure. Among disclosure facilitators is being asked about 
abuse and given the opportunity to "tell" (McElavaney et al., 
2014); workshops on abuse and sexual abuse, in particular, can 
facilitate disclosures (Ungar et al., 2009b); and using culturally 
sensitive probes and questions (Fontes & Plummer, 2010). In 
Gagnier and Collin-Vezina's (2016) study, positive disclosure 
experiences were described by participants as those where they 
felt that they had been listened to, were safe, were believed, and 
were not judged by the person they disclosed to. Further, family 
members and friends (peers) of the child victim can act as key 
supports to creating an open relational context and fostering 
positive responses (Jensen et al., 2005; Priebe & Svedin, 2008; 
Schonbucher et al., 2012; Ungar et al., 20096). In particular, as 
children grow older, they are more likely to disclose to a peer, 
as shown in a number of studies, and this is an important reality 
for counselors and educators to be aware of (Dumont et al., 
2014; Kogan, 2004; Sclainbucher et al., 2012; Ungar et al., 
2009b). 
Discussion 
Through examination of 33 studies published since the year 
2000, this review identified five distinct themes regarding CSA 
disclosure: (1) Disclosure is best viewed as an iterative, 
interactive process rather than a discrete event done within 
a relational context; (2) contemporary models reflect a 
social—ecological, person-in-environment framework for 
understanding the complex interplay of individual, familial, 
contextual, and cultural factors involved in CSA disclosure; 
(3) age and gender are significant disclosure factors; (4) there 
is a lack of a life-course perspective; and (5) barriers to disclo-
sure continue to outweigh facilitators. Based on these themes, a 
number of conclusions are drawn from this review. First, dis-
closure as a process is emphasized throughout contemporary 
research. Advances have been made in understanding these 
complex processes. However, the disclosure process over 
time—for example, how the first detection of CSA or attempts 
to disclose in childhood impact later disclosures—are not well 
understood. This is the result of the absence of a cohesive life-
course perspective in investigations, although age consistently 
surfaces as significantly influencing CSA disclosure. Using a 
life-course perspective through the use of longitudinal studies 
is recommended. 
The use of varied methodological designs, depending on the 
developmental stage of the victims/survivors, influences the 
data generated and subsequent findings. For example, most 
studies on children and youth are based on file reviews of cases 
that have been brought to the attention of authorities, or sur-
veys, with only a few studies using interviewing of younger 
children. Therefore, there is less information available on pro-
cess issues with children and youth. In contrast, research on 
adult populations largely favors the use of qualitative interview 
methods for retrospective inquiry producing important process 
findings. In addition, investigations have not yet captured the 
disclosure experiences of adults in the "emerging adult" stage 
given that adult studies have failed to recognized that the age 
range of 18-24, which is now considered a developmental 
phase defined by neurobiological developmental uniqueness. 
As well, late adulthood has not been given attention as shown 
by the absence of participants representing this age-group in 
current research (70+). With a swelling geriatric population in 
North America, issues of historic CSA can be expected to 
surface and, with that, new disclosures. This trend is also antici-
pated due to attitudinal shifts that have presumably occurred 
over the last two generations about revealing such traumas and 
changing views about discussing sexual victimization. 
Interview guides used in a number of studies intentionally 
probed for facilitators, producing notable findings. For exam-
ple, one such finding focuses on the importance of creating a 
contextually supportive environment to promote disclosure 
across the life course. These include developing therapeutic 
relational contexts for disclosure by providing information 
about sexuality, sexual abuse, prevention programming, and 
by asking directly. Disclosures to professionals are positive 
outcomes of how therapeutic contexts work; however, for for-
ensic purposes prompting such disclosures would be viewed as 
problematic in legal settings, seriously compromising testimo-
nies for trial proceedings. This is one example that speaks to the 
structural barriers victims and survivors run up against time and 
time again. Facilitators that show evidence to promote disclo-
sure in one domain (therapeutic) are seen to work against CSA 
survivors in another domain—such as legal settings when per-
petrators face prosecution. Defense attorneys will use this as 
evidence that the disclosure was prompted, and therefore the 
disclosure is potentially seen as not credible. Broadcasting of

the frequency of acquitted cases or rulings in favor of the 
perpetrator through media outlets, often sensationalized, 
become a further compounding barrier. Given the review find-
ings, we conclude that barriers and facilitators to CSA disclo-
sures are nuanced and clearly embedded within intrapersonal, 
interpersonal, environmental, contextual, and cultural 
domains—often interlocked in complex ways. 
Limitations 
Although comprehensive in nature with its life-course cover-
age, this review may be limited by its qualitative, thematic 
focus rather than providing an evaluative, quantitative account-
ing of CSA disclosures. However, because of the recent focus 
on disclosure processes, the authors chose a suitably compati-
ble approach—qualitative in nature. As well, a traditional 
checklist approach in rating the studies was not employed for 
interrater reliability, since two of the authors hold expertise in 
CSA disclosure research and are well versed with the literature. 
This expertise, and through closely following a systematic 
review framework (Kiteley & Stogdon, 2014), assures that a 
thorough adjudication of the research literature was completed. 
Implications for Research and Practice 
These review findings have implications that can be useful in 
guiding future research and practice:

Solid strides are being made in the use of a social—eco-
logical framework to underpin investigations in the CSA 
disclosure investigations. Research efforts and practice 
considerations should continue in this vein. Investigat-
ing environmental factors and contextual and cultural 
forces is understudied, necessitating more research in 
these areas to more fully fill out understanding of CSA 
disclosure from a social—ecological perspective. 
• 
There is good evidence that CSA disclosures are more 
likely to occur in a dialogical context—formal helping 
relationships but as well as other relationships such as 
peers and trusted adults. Providing information and edu-
cation on topics of sexuality in general, and sexual abuse 
specifically, can help children and youth to disclose. 
Raising awareness and prevention programs can pro-
mote disclosures of sexual violence committed against 
children and youth. 
• 
Goals of therapeutically supported disclosures (i.e., 
through therapy) may need to take precedence over for-
ensic approaches, if well-being of child victims and 
adult survivors is to be made paramount. Legal pro-
cesses may act to facilitate disclosures but can also act 
as barriers because of the negative outcomes experi-
enced in the court process. 
• 
Practitioners need to keep in mind that the legal system 
is lagging far behind in knowledge uptake of recent 
evidence on CSA disclosures so that victims and 
survivors continue to be systemically and structurally 
disadvantaged in legal proceedings. 
• 
Health-care practitioners (i.e., child abuse pediatricians, 
family practice doctors, clinical nurse specialists, and 
public health nurses) should be made aware of the evi-
dence in the CSA disclosure literature to create environ-
ments for facilitating therapeutic disclosures. 
• 
Given that age is a stable predictor of disclosure of CSA, 
more studies are needed that make use of a life-course 
perspective. More longitudinal studies are needed to 
better identify trends over different life stages. 
• 
The emerging young adult as a developmental age group 
needs specific investigation. Neuroscience research has 
established that ages 18-24 is a distinct developmental 
phase. Late adulthood is another life stage that deserves 
to be researched. 
• 
Gender needs to be more fully investigated in relation to 
impact on disclosure. Awareness that boys and girls 
have unique challenges and barriers in disclosing CSA 
should be paramount for practitioners. 
• 
Intervention planning should take note that disclosures 
increase when perpetrators no longer reside with vic-
tims, and this finding should be heeded by policy and 
law makers. 
• 
Shame, self-blame, and fear are intrapersonal factors 
that persistently emerge as barriers to CSA disclosures 
and warrant more research to understand how to redress 
these barriers for earlier disclosures. 
Conclusion 
There are still a substantial number of children and youth 
who are subjected to sexual abuse, despite preventative 
efforts. Just as concerning is the fact that many victims 
continue to suffer in silence as evidenced by the high num-
bers of delayed disclosure. These hidden cases should not be 
overlooked, and these victims should not be forgotten. 
Despite significant progress in bringing the issue of CSA 
to the forefront, improving facilitation of disclosure and 
increasing positive influences on disclosure processes are 
still critical in order to protect current and future genera-
tions of children and youth from the grave effects of sexual 
violence. Further, the focus should not be simply on 
strengthening and shoring up intrapersonal resources of vic-
tims to disclose but rather to change environmental condi-
tions to create a more supportive and safer context for CSA 
victims and survivors to disclose.

Disclosure of Child 
Sexual Abuse: Delays, 
Non-disclosure and 
Partial Disclosure. What 
the Research Tells Us and 
Implications for Practice 
This paper reviews the research on disclosure of child sexual abuse with specific reference 
to delays in disclosing, non-disclosure and partial disclosure of experiences of child sexual 
abuse. Findings from large-scale national probability studies highlight the prevalence of 
both non-disclosure and delays in disclosure, while findings from small-scale qualitative 
studies portray the complexity, diversity and individuality of experiences. The possible 
explanations regarding why children are reluctant to disclose such experiences have 
significant implications for addressing the issue of child sexual abuse from the perspectives 
of child protection, legal and therapeutic professionals. The importance of understanding 
the dynamics of disclosure, in particular the needs of young people to maintain control over 
the disclosure process, the important role that peers play in this process, the responses 
of adults in both informal and formal networks, and the opportunities to tell, is key to 
helping young people speak more promptly about their experiences of sexual abuse.

KEY PRACTITIONER MESSAGES: 
• Children typically delay disclosing experiences of abuse. 
• Asking children questions about their wellbeing gives them the opportunity to tell 
when they are ready. 
• The challenge is to find the right questions at the right time. 
• Peers can be the right people to ask these questions. 
• Adolescents need to know about how to ask and what to do if someone tells. 
KEY WORDS: child sex abuse; disclosure; research to practice 
A

delayed disclosure of childhood sexual abuse and the need to understand 
the process of how children and adults disclose their experiences of child 
sexual abuse, given the implications for child protection, social justice and

mental health outcomes. This paper reviews the research on disclosure patterns 
of childhood sexual abuse, specifically delays in disclosure, non-disclosure 
(as evident through adult retrospective studies) and partial disclosures, and 
discusses implications for practice. Literature searches of the online databases 
PSYCINFO and Social Sciences Citation Index, in addition to manual searches 
of texts published since 2000, were conducted using the search terms 'child 
sexual abuse', 'sex abuse' and 'disclosure'. 
The research to date on disclosure patterns is based on two sampling 
methodologies — studies of adults reporting retrospective experiences and 
studies of children. The former group of studies has the benefit of drawing 
on large-scale national probability samples which can be considered to be 
representative of the general population. The latter group with some small 
exceptions (predominantly adolescent studies) uses samples of young people 
who have disclosed sexual abuse but would not be considered as representative 
of all children who have been abused: 
'children who decide to tell someone about being sexually abused and whose 
cases therefore come to court are not representative of sexually abused children in general' 
(Olafson and Lederman, 2006, p. 29). 
Patterns of Disclosure: Delays and Non-disclosure 
There is consensus in the research literature that most people who experience 
sexual abuse in childhood do not disclose this abuse until adulthood, and when 
disclosure does occur in childhood, significant delays are common. Table 1 
summarises two large-scale studies to highlight the extent of delays in disclosure 
and the percentage of those who did not disclose to anyone prior to the study. 
Kogan (2004) examined the timing of disclosure of unwanted sexual 
experiences in childhood or adolescence in a sub-sample (n = 263 adolescent 
women, aged 12 to 17) of the National Survey of Adolescents (Kilpatrick and 
Saunders, 1995) in the USA — a nationally representative study. Kogan's 
results can be summarised as follows: immediate disclosure (within 1 month) 
per cent, delayed disclosure (less than 1 year) 31 per cent and non-disclosure 
(disclosed only during the survey) 26 per cent. Smith and colleagues (2000) 
examined a sub-sample (n = 288) of the National Women's Study in the 
USA (Resnick a al., 1993, cited in Smith et at, 2000) who had reported a 
childhood rape prior to the age of 18. Smith el al.'s findings can be 
summarised as follows: immediate disclosure (within 1 month) 27 per cent, 
delayed disclosure (more than a year) 58 per cent and non-disclosure (survey 
only) 28 per cent. Those who had never disclosed prior to the survey constitute 
comparable proportions in these two studies while the rates for immediate

Disclosure Patterns in Child Sexual Abuse 
161 
disclosure are higher in the adolescent study than in the adult study, a 
reassuring finding given the increased awareness of sexual abuse in society 
during the past 20 years. 
Goodman-Brown and colleagues (2003) examined USA district attorney 
files of 218 children. Their categories were slightly different from the previous 
two studies but in summary, immediate disclosers (within 1 month) constituted 
per cent of the sample while 29 per cent disclosed within six months. 
This study is unusual insofar as the sample studied had reported their 
experience of abuse to the authorities and a prosecution was in progress. 
Goodman-Brown et at also pointed out that families who participated in this 
study were more likely to represent those children who experienced abuse by 
someone outside the family. Research has found that delays in disclosure are 
longer for those abused within the family (Sjoberg and Lindblad, 2002; 
Goodman-Brown et at, 2003; Kogan, 2004; Hershkowitz a at, 2005). 
Therefore, children who disclose more promptly may be overrepresented in 
legal samples. 
In Sweden, Priebe and Svedin (2008) conducted a national survey of 4339 
adolescents, of whom 1962 reported some form of sexual abuse (65% of girls 
and 23% of boys). Details of the time lapse in disclosing were not available 
from this study. However, of those who had disclosed and answered the 
questions on disclosure (n = 1493), 59.5 per cent had told no-one of their 
experiences prior to the survey. Of those who did disclose, 80.5 per cent 
mentioned a 'friend of my own age' as the only person who they had told. In 
this study, 6.8 per cent had reported their experiences to the social authorities 
or police. A further Swedish study of 122 women who had experienced 
childhood sexual abuse (Jonson and Lindblad, 2004) found that 32 per cent 
disclosed during childhood (before the age of 18) while the majority told in 
adulthood (68%). The delay was up to 49 years, with an average of 21 years 
(SD = 12.9). Of those who told in childhood, 59 per cent told only one person. 
In Ireland, the SAVI study (n = 3118, McGee et al., 2002) found that 47 per 
cent of those respondents who had experienced some form of sexual assault 
prior to age 17 had told no-one of this experience until the survey. McElvaney 
(2002) investigated delay in a legal sample of ten adults who had made formal 
complaints of childhood sexual abuse in Ireland and found delays ranging from 
years to 50 years. 
Studies of children in the context of forensic/investigative interviews 
where children are interviewed by professionals due to concerns that the 
child has been sexually abused also point to high non-disclosure rates, 
particularly striking in cases where there is corroborative evidence that 
abuse has occurred — medical evidence (Lyon, 2007), or confessions from 
the abuser or videotaped evidence/witness reports (Sjoberg and Lindblad, 
2002). Lyon (2007) reported his findings from a review of studies 
published between 1965 and 1993 of children diagnosed with gonorrhoea 
where the average disclosure rate among 579 children was 43 per cent 
(n = 250). In a study where the evidence for the abuse was available on videotape, 
children have denied abuse when interviewed by the police (Sjoberg and 
Lindblad, 2002). 
In summary, significant numbers of children do not disclose experiences of 
sexual abuse until adulthood and adult survey results suggest that significant

Patterns of Disclosure — Partial Disclosure 
Information on how children disclose over time can be obtained from studies 
of children who participated in forensic/investigative interviews where 
children are interviewed by professionals due to concerns that the child has 
been sexually abused. The issue of partial disclosures was highlighted by 
earlier studies such as those by DeVoe and Faller (1999) of five- to ten-year 
olds (i.e. making detailed informal disclosures that were not replicated in 
formal interviews) and Elliott and Briere (1994) of children aged eight to 
years (i.e. disclosing only partial information until confronted with external 
evidence that led to more complete disclosures). 
More recently, investigators have examined the role of the interviewer and 
questioning styles in the forensic interview and how this impacts on children's 
disclosures and the level of detail provided in interview. Hershkowitz et at 
(2006) compared tapes of interviews with children who disclosed sexual abuse 
and those who did not (but about whom there was `substantial' reason to 
believe that they had been abused). They found that interviewers behaved 
differently with the two groups, using different types of prompts with children 
who presented as somewhat uncooperative, offered fewer details and gave 
more uninformative responses at the beginning of the interview. It would 
appear that interviewers responded to less communicative children by 
increasing the proportion of closed questions which in turn led to children 
being less forthcoming. Lamb el al. (2002) have found that the use of a 
protocol that emphasises the use of prompts that elicit free narrative (e.g. 'tell 
me about that') as compared with closed questions (those requiring a yes/no 
response) has resulted in more detail and more accuracy in children's 
accounts. 
Although few studies exist that examine the phenomenon of disclosure in 
informal settings (when disclosure is made to a friend or family member), 
some qualitative studies have described this process. McElvaney (2008) quoted 
one teenage girl who described hinting to her mother prior to disclosing the 
experience: 'I didn't tell her what happened but I was saying things that made 
her think it made her think that it happened but I didn't tell her' (p. 127). A 
parent described how her teenage son told her over a period of days, keeping 
the most difficult parts of the story until last: 
'Ile came out with like it came out over two or three days so you know.. _he'd say well 
I've something else to tell you... the bad stuff last... what hun him most and what he's 
saying what hurt him most' (p. 92) 
And finally, one young person described how she told her social worker: 
'I couldn't tell her most things but I just gave things to her to read... I told her at first I told 
her bits of it and em then just the others. I finished writing and then I gave them to her... later 
I told her that it was the father as well.' (p. 93) 
This young person had been abused by both a father and son in a family with 
whom she was staying.

Disclosure Patterns in Child Sexual Abuse 
163 
In reviewing the literature on this subject, London and colleagues (2005) 
noted, `when children do disclose, it often takes them a long time to do so' 
(p. 204). 
Reasons for Patterns of Delay, Partial Disclosure and Non-disclosure 
There are many influences on disclosure that have been identified in the 
research literature to help explain why it is that children delay disclosure, are 
reluctant to disclose, provide details of their experiences over time or do not 
disclose at all. Age has been identified as a significant predictor of disclosure 
in that younger children are less likely to disclose than older children. Children 
who are abused by a family member are less likely to disclose and more likely 
to delay disclosure than those abused by someone outside the family (Smith 
a at, 2000; Goodman-Brown a at, 2003; Kogan, 2004). Children who do 
disclose during forensic interviews compared to children who do not disclose 
in such contexts (yet concerns remain that they have been abused) are more 
likely to have parents (particularly mothers) who are more supportive (Lawson 
and Chaffin, 1992). In Priebe and Svedin's (2008) study of young people, 
parental bonding (positive relationship with parent who was not overprotective) 
was identified as the most significant predictor of disclosure for both boys and 
girls. However, close relationships can also act as an inhibitor to disclosure. 
McElvaney (2008) found that many young people in her study were reluctant 
to disclose due to concerns of upsetting their parents while others were concerned 
about the consequences for others of their disclosure. One 13-year-old girl 
described her concern that if she told, her uncle would go to jail and her small 
cousins would be left without a father: 
'I didn't want them to grow up with no Dad and just looking at ... their other little friends 
having their Dad holding their hand I felt like I was taking their Dad away from them' (p. 130) 
Gender has been found to influence disclosure in that boys appear to be 
more reluctant to disclose than girls (Goodman-Brown a at, 2003; 
Hershkowitz a at, 2005; Ungar a al., 2009a). Mental health difficulties on 
the part of the child have also been found to be relevant, particularly when 
children experience dissociative symptoms or other post-traumatic stress 
symptomatology (Priebe and Svedin, 2008). 
Some studies have found that the severity of abuse (e.g. penetrative abuse) 
predicts earlier disclosure while other studies have found no relationship 
between different types of abuse and disclosure timing. Similarly, the relationship 
between the duration of abuse — one-off incidents of abuse compared with abuse 
that takes place over a significant period of time — and timely disclosure has been 
investigated with mixed findings. Fear of the consequences of disclosure has been 
identified as a predictor of delayed disclosure and this in turn is associated with 
the age of the child (Goodman-Brown a at, 2003). Older children are more 
cognitively competent in terms of being able to reflect on and anticipate possible 
reactions to their disclosure. This can act then as an inhibitor to disclosure, 
although as noted above, most studies have found that older children are more 
likely to disclose than younger children. Fears of not being believed have been 
described by young people as inhibiting their disclosure and these fears are often 
"When children do 
disclose, it often takes 
them a long time to do 
so"

`Investigating the 
precise 
circumstances that 
led to disclosures for 
children' 
`Significant 
proportions of 
disclosure have been 
prompted by 
questions by 
caregivers, friends or 
others' 
`The implications of 
these findings can be 
considered in 
interrelated contexts' 
justified. Hershkowitz a at (2007) interviewed children about their initial 
disclosures prior to formal interview and 50 per cent of the sample (n = 30) 
reported feeling afraid or ashamed of their parents' reaction. The authors reported 
that parents did show a tendency to blame their children and react angrily to 
the disclosure. 
Recent research has highlighted the need for children to be asked direct 
questions to facilitate their disclosure. Of those children who did disclose, 
significant proportions disclosed following prompts rather than it being 
initiated by the child (Kogan, 2004). Qualitative studies drawing on interviews 
with children that focus on the disclosure process are important in 
investigating the precise circumstances that led to disclosures for children. 
McElvaney (2008) found that parents' questioning of children was prompted 
by their concern about the young person's emotional distress. On occasion, 
young people were communicating that something was not right in their world 
but were not able to articulate this verbally. Signs of psychological distress 
were, however, evident and questions targeted at the reasons for this distress 
were identified by McElvaney as a factor that helped young people to tell. 
Thus, many children may not have told about their experiences of abuse 
because they were not asked. McGee a al. (2002) followed up a sample of 
their respondents who had disclosed childhood abuse for the first time in their 
survey. When asked why they had not disclosed prior to the survey, many 
respondents noted that it was because they had not been asked. Increasingly, 
research studies are finding that significant proportions of disclosure have 
been prompted by questions by caregivers, friends or others in the child's 
educational and social milieu that in themselves provide an opportunity for 
the young person to tell (Jensen et at, 2005; Hershkowitz a at, 2007; 
McElvaney et al., 2012). 
Finally, some children need time to tell. Mudaly and Goddard (2006) quote 
a 13-year-old girl: `she (mother) helped by not making me, not rushing me 
to get it out, which, um, I think it's a really stupid idea to make kids get it 
out A.S.A.P.' (p. 91). 
Implications for Practice 
The consensus in the research literature at the present time is that disclosure is 
multi-determined, influenced by a complex range of factors that may influence 
each child in a different way. Large-scale national probability studies confirm 
that non-disclosure and delays in disclosure are significant problems facing 
society and in particular for those professionals tasked with safeguarding the 
wellbeing of children. Children's fears and anxieties in relation to telling need 
to be understood and contained by those in their environment so that early 
disclosure can be encouraged and facilitated. 
The implications of these findings can be considered in interrelated 
contexts: the legal context where action can only be taken if the child is able 
to give a clear, credible account of his/her experiences; child protection and 
therapeutic contexts where a comprehensive account is required to enable child 
protection professionals to intervene and where the psychological sequelae can 
be addressed to minimise the long-term impact of the experiences; and family 
and community contexts where early disclosure needs to be encouraged, and

other family issues addressed in the aftermath of disclosure and where peers 
play an important role. 
Studies have confirmed the importance of professionals asking children and 
young people in a sensitive, open manner about possible experiences of abuse 
using non-leading questioning styles to minimise inaccurate accounts or 
contaminate children's narratives. It is clearly important for professionals to 
remain open to the possibility of abuse and further disclosure. It is equally 
important for professionals to be able to avoid persisting with questioning 
those children who are 'reluctant disclosers'. Similarly, professionals engaged 
with children in therapeutic work need to be open to the possibility of both 
initial and further disclosures. 
Contradiction in witness statements is a well-known feature of false statements 
and giving additional detail to original formal statements can be interpreted 
within child protection, therapeutic and legal contexts as a contradiction of an 
earlier account. Listening to children's accounts of their experiences of disclosure 
helps us understand why it is that disclosure can be delayed and that when they do 
feel ready to tell this is not an 'all or nothing' decision. As one young person in 
Staller and Nelson-Gardell's (2005) study noted, 'it's never finished, never' p. 
1426. This understanding in turn helps us identify those circumstances and 
reactions that may encourage the child to disclose. 
The importance of asking children questions, thus giving them an 
opportunity to tell, has been identified. While parents, teachers and those in 
daily contact with children are often reluctant to question children, it is clear 
that many children do not disclose unless given this opportunity. Education 
and increased awareness are needed on how to question children in an 
appropriate manner. McElvaney (2008) noted that questions did not need to 
be about sexual abuse per se, but rather questions prompted by the young 
person's psychological distress, asking after the young people's wellbeing. 
This questioning in effect acted as an external pressure for the young person 
to tell his/her secret (McElvaney et al., 2012). In Ungar el at's (2009a) study 
of Canadian youth, they found that young people used a range of disclosure 
strategies ranging from less direct strategies (such as risk-taking behaviours, 
not talking about the abuse) to direct strategies (such as seeking support from 
peers, turning to non-professional adult supports, disclosing to formal service 
providers), representing a process that relied heavily on others to 'build the 
bridges between the youth and formal care providers' (p. 352). 
The tendency to delay disclosing and the partial nature of many disclosures 
are not conducive to successful legal investigations and prosecutions. In 
addition, the knowledge base that exists within the legal sphere is limited if 
only a percentage of the children who experience sexual abuse engage with 
this system. The disproportionately high 'immediate disclosure' rate found 
in Goodman-Brown a al.'s (2003) legal sample compared to Kogan's 
(2004) community sample raises the question of the representation of delayed 
disclosers in the legal system. Are children who delay in disclosing less likely 
to engage with the legal system? Are delays in disclosing contributing to 
decisions not to prosecute child sexual abuse crimes? In Ireland, the 1990s 
saw a significant increase in the numbers of complainants coming before the 
courts reporting experiences of childhood sexual abuse. Many of these cases 
were referred to the higher courts for judicial review proceedings to establish 
whether the cases could proceed without prejudicing the accused given the 
'Contradiction in 
witness statements is 
a well-known feature 
of false statements' 
'Education and 
increased awareness 
are needed on how to 
question children in 
an appropriate 
manner'

'Concerns that 
engagement with the 
legal system will lead 
to further 
psychological trauma 
need to be considered' 
'Many young people

had told a friend' 
'An adaptive strategy 
on the part of the 
young person to

delay in the complaint being made and giving due regard to the accused's right 
to a speedy trial. Psychological expert testimony was sought as part of these 
proceedings to explain the delay in disclosure in each individual case to enable 
the courts to adjudicate on whether the delay in reporting was reasonable (see 
McElvaney, 2002). This legal mechanism provided an opportunity to enhance 
the knowledge base within the legal profession as to the complexities involved 
in disclosing and formally reporting experiences of childhood sexual abuse for 
adults. While one might expect that the legal system would be more 
sympathetic to children's difficulties in making disclosures, it may also be 
the case that the belief that 'if the child was really sexually abused, why would 
they not tell?', as articulated by Summit (1983), still prevails. 
In addition, concerns that engagement with the legal system will lead to further 
psychological trauma need to be considered. A prospective longitudinal study 
conducted by Quas et al. (2005) indicated that the consequences of legal 
involvement change over the course of development and as a function of the 
child's reactions to and experiences during the legal case. The associations 
between legal involvement and outcomes varied with age. The authors 
suggested that although younger children may be at increased risk for some 
adverse outcomes such as mental health problems, older children may be at 
increased risk for other undesirable sequelae such as the negative attitudes 
of others toward them. Quas and Goodman's (2011) recent review notes that 
older children are more at risk in developing poor mental health outcomes. 
Thus, as noted earlier, young people's fears of the consequences of disclosure 
may well be justified. Raised awareness of both the prevalence of non-disclosure 
of sexual abuse and the importance of supporting children to disclose may 
go some way to addressing children's fears. 
One interesting finding in recent studies is that many young people who 
delayed disclosure to an adult had told a friend. McElvaney (2008) and Ungar 
et al. (2009b) identified peer influence as significant in encouraging disclosure 
among adolescents. There is some suggestion from the research that regardless 
of the age at the time of abuse, adolescence may be a 'critical period' for 
disclosure. It may be that targeting adolescents in general (rather than those 
at risk of abuse) may be a powerful prevention tool in encouraging early 
disclosure. Evaluations of child abuse prevention programmes have shown 
significant improvements in the levels of awareness of child abuse in children 
and young people (Rispers et al., 1997; Zwi el al., 2007). It may be that the 
increasing trend towards peer disclosure is a by-product of such educational 
and awareness-raising programmes. There is evidence that public awareness 
campaigns when implemented as part of a multi-dimensional strategy that 
involves targeting children, parents and communities (see Lalor and McElvaney, 
2010, for a review of child abuse prevention programmes) are an effective tool in 
the prevention of child abuse. 
McElvaney et al. (2012) describe the importance for young people of 
containing the secret of abuse and their need for confidentiality following 
disclosure as representing an adaptive strategy on the part of the young person 
to contain the experience and his/her emotional reaction to it. The conflict 
between wanting/needing to keep the secret and wanting/needing to tell is 
mediated by what they term the 'pressure cooker effect'. Young people in their 
study described influences from within and without that led to a build up of 
pressure, ultimately leading to disclosure. They suggest that building up the

pressure for young people by providing opportunities to tell may be needed to 
help young people tell more promptly. However, the lack of control that young 
people experience following disclosure remains an issue (Ungar et al., 2009b; 
Quayle a al., 2012). This highlights the need for dissemination of information 
directly to young people about the legal process, the possible consequences of 
disclosure, as well as ongoing developments in legal proceedings when young 
people and their families interface with the legal system. 
The more recent focus on investigating those strategies that children use in 
making disclosures rather than solely on identifying bathers to disclosure is 
perhaps more helpful in informing awareness-raising campaigns and 
professional interventions. The author is involved in a large-scale review of 
children's files in an assessment service to ascertain those factors that helped 
children tell about their experiences of sexual abuse. A pilot study has 
suggested that this is an appropriate methodology for gathering data on 
children's experiences of informal disclosure, acknowledging the limitations 
of such an approach. Ungar a al. (2009a) describe the optimal conditions for 
disclosure as follows: being directly asked about experiences of abuse; having 
access to someone who will listen, believe and respond appropriately; having 
knowledge and language about what constitutes abuse and how to access help; 
having a sense of control over the process of disclosure both in terms of their 
anonymity (not being identified until they are ready for this) and confidentiality 
(the right to control who knows); and effective responses by adults both in 
informal and formal contexts. 
Ungar etal. (2009b) support recent developments in prevention programmes 
that target supportive formal and informal caregivers in being better able to 
detect the possibility of abuse and support disclosures rather than focusing 
on empowering children themselves in making disclosures. Their findings in 
relation to the importance of bridge building for young people to access formal 
supports are supported by Jensen et at's (2005) emphasis on the dialogical 
nature of disclosure, and the important role that trusted adults and peers play 
in the disclosure process through noticing signs of psychological distress and 
asking young people about their psychological wellbeing (Collings a al., 
2005; Jensen et at, 2005; McElvaney et at, 2012). More emphasis is therefore 
needed on providing opportunities for children and young people to disclose. 
The challenge for professionals and those who care for children is how to do 
this in a way that protects children and promotes their wellbeing.

Background: Delayed disclosure of rape has been associated with impaired mental health; it is, therefore, important 
to understand which factors are associated with disclosure latency. The purpose of this study was to compare 
various demographics, post rape characteristics, and psychological functioning of early and delayed disclosers 
(i.e., more than I week post rape) among rape victims, and to determine predictors for delayed disclosure. 
Methods: Data were collected using a structured interview and validated questionnaires in a sample of 323 
help seeking female adolescents and young adults (12 25 years). who were victimized by rape, but had no 
reported prior chronic child sexual abuse. 
Results: In 59% of the cases, disclosure occurred within I week. Delayed disclosers were less likely to use medical 
services and to report to the police than early disclosers. No significant differences were found between delayed 
and early disclosers in psychological functioning and time to seek professional help. The combination of 
age category 12 17 years [odds ratio (OR) 2.05, confidence intervals (CI) 1.13 3.73], penetration (OR 2.36, 
CI 1.25 4.46), and closeness to assailant (OR 2.64, CI 1.52 4.60) contributed significantly to the prediction 
of delayed disclosure. 
Conclusion: The results point to the need of targeted interventions that specifically encourage rape victims to 
disclose early, thereby increasing options for access to health and police services.

p
revious studies have shown that disclosure of rape 
to formal agencies, such as police or mental health 
services, is uncommon (Fisher, Cullen, & Turner, 
2000; Wolitzky-Taylor et al., 2011), especially when the 
rape has been committed on a date or by an acquaintance 
and involves the victim's use of drugs and/or alcohol 
(Resnick et al., 2000; Wolitzky-Taylor et al., 2011). There is 
evidence to suggest that victims believe that professionals 
will not be helpful to them because their rape experience 
does not match stereotypical conceptions of rape, such 
as involving a stranger, a weapon, and severe injury 
(Patterson, Greeson, & Campbell, 2009; Resnick et al., 
2000). Accordingly, adolescents and young adults, who 
are more at risk to be victimized by rape than other age 
88flon 
groups (De Haas, Van Berlo, Bakker, & Vanwesenbeeck, 
2012; Tjaden & Thoennes, 2006), may not receive targeted 
mental health care and may not report the crime to the 
police (Ruch, Coyne, & Perrone, 2000). 
For reasons of mental health and public safety, it is 
important to understand the potential factors that are 
related to disclosure. Timing of disclosure may be a crucial 
factor, as early disclosers are more likely to utilize appro-
priate medical care and report to the police than delayed 
disclosers (Ahrens, Stansell, & Jennings, 2010; Ullman & 
Filipas, 2001). In contrast, adults who wait longer than 
month to disclose the rape are more likely to suffer 
from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depres-
sion compared to early disclosers (Ruggiero et al., 2004).

In addition, adolescents who disclose their rape experience 
at least I month after the incident took place are found 
to be at higher risk for major depressive disorder and 
delinquency (Broman-Fulks et al., 2007) compared to those 
who disclosed within I month. 
Victim—assailant relationship is crucial in disclosure 
latency, with victims being at higher risk for delayed dis-
closure if there is a close relation with the assailant (Kogan, 
2004; Koss, 1988; Rickert, Wiemann, & Vaughan, 2005). 
In contrast, delayed disclosure is less common in victims 
of a stereotypical rape, i.e., rape by a stranger including a 
weapon and injury (Smith et al., 2000). Victims of prior 
sexual trauma are more likely to postpone disclosure of a 
subsequent assault than those without prior victimization 
(Smith et al., 2000; Ullman, 1996). This is in contrast with 
the findings of Ahrens et al. (2010), who report no dif-
ference in rates of prior sexual trauma between early and 
delayed disclosers. In addition, the victim's age appears 
to be an important variable in predicting disclosure. 
Evidence suggests that young children are at higher risk 
for delayed disclosure than adolescents (Kogan, 2004; 
Schonbucher, Maier, Mohler-Kuo, Schnyder, & Landolt, 
2012). Thus, various rape and victim-related character-
istics have been found to be associated with timing of 
disclosure. 
The majority of the aforementioned studies included 
college and adult female rape victims. It is important to 
examine rape disclosure latency in an age and sex group 
that is most at risk for rape victimization. There is only 
one prior quantitative study in adolescents (those aged 
12-17 years) that identified factors that might influence 
disclosure latency (Kogan, 2004). He found that identity 
of the assailant, a familial relationship with the assailant, 
and a history of drug abuse in the household were related 
to the timing of disclosure. The results suggested that 
a familial relationship with the assailant will postpone 
disclosure, whereas a history of drug abuse in the house-
hold, albeit this seems counterintuitive, makes prompt 
disclosure more likely. This study had some limitations, 
including the fact that the interviews were conducted by 
telephone and that the description of the relationship with 
the assailant was limited. Therefore, in the present study, 
we investigated a sample of female adolescent and young 
adult victims of rape who were admitted to a specialized 
mental health centre for victims of sexual assault. The first 
aim of this study was to compare demographics, post-rape 
characteristics, and psychological functioning between 
early and delayed disclosers in this group. The second aim, 
based on the exploratory findings of Kogan (2004), was to 
determine the predictors for delayed disclosure in adoles-
cents and young adults, including age, prior trauma, and 
victim—assailant relationship using logistic regression 
analyses. Insight into the predictors for delayed disclosure 
for adolescents and young adults may reveal not only 
potential causal mechanisms but also possible targets for 
interventions that increase victims' opportunities to 
receive timely post-rape services. 
Methods 
Subjects and data collection 
Rape was defined as "an event that occurred without the 
victim's consent that involved the use or threat of force in 
vaginal, anal, or oral intercourse" (Tjaden & Thoennes, 
2006). The definition includes both attempted and com-
pleted rape; the term "completed" referring to vaginal, 
oral, anal, or multiple penetrations. Victims who disclosed 
within 1 week were defined as "early disclosers," whereas 
those who disclosed at least after 1 week were defined as 
"delayed disclosers." This dichotomization of the variable 
"disclosure latency" was based on the study of Ahrens 
et al. (2010) and the national standard criteria for admis-
sion to a Rape Centre in the Netherlands, i.e., a maximum 
of 7 days post-rape. 
The study was conducted in the Dutch National 
Psychotrauma Centre, which provides psychological ser-
vices for rape victims aged 12-25 years and their parents. 
Between May 2005 and December 2011, the centre re-
ceived 621 phone calls concerning alleged rape victims 
from police authorities, mental health services, and self-
referrals. In 178 cases, the phone call did not result in 
admission at the centre because of age limitations, or 
motivational reasons. In 108 cases, referrals were made to 
other institutions because the index trauma was chronic 
childhood sexual abuse rather than rape in adolescence/ 
young adulthood. Of the 335 cases admitted to the centre, 
were not included in this study because of male gender, 
resulting in a final sample of 323 females with the index 
trauma being single rape. Referral sources for this final 
sample included the police (33.7%), mental health services 
(40.7%). and self-referrals, i.e., victims or parents (25.6%). 
Procedure 
During admission, all patients underwent a psychological 
assessment, consisting of 1) a structured interview for 
obtaining demographic and post-rape characteristics and 
2) self-report questionnaires to obtain information about 
mental health functioning. Information from the inter-
view was transcribed onto a form designed for this 
purpose. The following variables were obtained and 
dichotomized or categorized for the purpose of the study: 
Demographic and victim characteristics 
We asked patients about their current age, educational 
level (lower, middle, or higher), and whether they were of 
Dutch origin (i.e., in case of having parents born in the 
Netherlands). Those between 12 and 17 years of age were 
defined as adolescents and those between 18 and 25 years 
of age as young adults. We also asked whether the patient 
was living with their parent(s) (yes/no), and whether the

Precictors of delayed disclosure of rape 
family structure was complete, i.e., whether the biological 
parents were living together (yes/no). Patients were then 
asked to confirm the presence of prior negative sexual 
experiences (yes/no), and whether they had a current 
sexual relationship (yes/no). 
Rape characteristics 
Information about date and time of the rape was ob-
tained to calculate the time since rape at admission. Next, 
patients were requested to describe the rape. Their re-
sponse was categorized into use of penetration (yes/no), 
group rape (yes/no), use of physical violence (yes/no), and 
use of threats verbally and/or with a weapon (yes/no). 
Also, information regarding the victim's relationship to 
the assailant was obtained. The assailant was defined as 
a stranger when the victim had never been in contact 
with the assailant before the rape. Responses were used 
to form a closeness category (yes in case of family, (boy) 
friend, or mentor). Patients were also asked about the 
(estimated) age of the assailant (categorized into 12-17 
years or > 18 years), and whether the victim had used 
alcohol prior to the rape (yes/no). 
Post-rape characteristics 
Patients were asked when they first talked about the rape. 
The response was used to calculate the disclosure time 
and the help-seeking time. At the end of the interview, 
patients were asked whether they had reported to the 
police after the incident (yes/no), and whether they had 
received any medical care after the incident (yes/no). 
The study was performed in accordance with the 
precepts and regulations for research as stated in the 
Declaration of Helsinki, and the Dutch Medical Research 
involving Humans Subjects Act concerning scientific 
research. According to the Ethical Medical Committee 
of the University Medical Centre Utrecht, this act was not 
applicable to the present study. Written informed consent 
was obtained from both patients and parents. 
Measures 
Posttraumatic stress 
The Children's Responses to Trauma Inventory (CRTI; 
Alisic, Eland, & Kleber, 2006) was used for participants 
aged 12-18 years. This is a 34-item questionnaire asses-
sing severity of PTSD symptoms according to DSM-IV. 
Patients are asked to indicate to what extent a reaction 
to a traumatic event was present during the past week. 
Scores range from I to 5, with higher scores indicating 
more symptomatology. The four subscales: Intrusion, 
Avoidance, Arousal, and Other Child-Specific Reactions 
consist of 7, 11, 6, and 10 items, respectively. The reli-
ability of this instrument is good to excellent (Cronbach's 
a 0.92 for total score, 0.79 for Intrusion, 0.77 for 
Avoidance, 0.71 for Arousal; Alisic & Kleber. 2010). 
For the purpose of the study, only the total score was 
analysed. 
Depression 
Children Depression Inventory (CDI; Kovacs, 1992; 
Timbremont & Braet, 2002) was used for participants 
aged 12-17 years of age. The CDI is a 27-item ques-
tionnaire, assessing cognitive, affective, and behavioural 
symptoms of depression. The Dutch CDI has a satisfac-
tory internal consistency, with Cronbach's a ranging 
between 0.71 and 0.89 (Timbremont & Braet, 2002). 
Behavioural problems 
The Youth Self-Report (YSR; Achenbach & Rescorla, 
2001) was used for participants aged 12—I8 years. This 
questionnaire evaluates the teenager's perception of be-
havioural and emotional problems. YSR has shown to 
be internally reliable (Cronbach's a's ranging from 0.71 
to 0.95), and convergent and discriminant validity is 
reported to be satisfactory (Berube & Achenbach, 2006). 
The YSR includes four broadband scales and nine 
narrow-band scales to assess behaviour problems. For 
the purpose of the study, only the total score on behaviour 
problems was included in the analyses. 
General psychopathology 
The Symptom Checklist-90-R (SCL-90-R; Arrindell & 
Ettema, 1986) was used for participants aged 12-25 years. 
This is a 90-item self-report inventory to assess psycho-
social distress. Patients were instructed to indicate the 
amount they were bothered by each of the distress 
symptoms during the preceding week. Patients rated 90 
distress symptoms on a five-point Liken scale with 
being "not at all" and 5 being "extremely." The state-
ments are assigned to eight dimensions, reflecting various 
types of psychopathology: anxiety, agoraphobia, depres-
sion, somatization, insufficiency, sensitivity, hostility, and 
insomnia. The Global Severity Index (GSI) can be used 
as a summary of the test and reflects the severity of all 
answered statements as a global measure of distress. 
Cronbach's a has been found to range from 0.73 to 0.97. 
For the purpose of the study, only the GSI was analysed. 
Data analyses 
To compare demographic and post-rape characteristics 
between the early and delayed disclosers, chi-square tests 
were used. To compare multiple continuous psychological 
scores, MANCOVA was used with "time since trauma" as 
a covariate to correct for the potential influence of time 
since trauma. 
Delayed disclosure was used as a dependent variable. 
The strength of the univariate associations between each 
potential risk factor and delayed disclosure was estimated 
by calculating the odds ratio (OR) along with 95% 
confidence intervals (95% CI). To determine the strongest 
risk factors for delayed disclosure, each potential risk

factor identified in the univariate analyses with a sig-
nificant OR (p <0.05) was entered as a predictor variable 
into the multivariable model, using a stepwise forward 
logistic regression (LR) analysis with delayed disclosure 
as the outcome variable. The Hosmer—Lemeshow goodness-
of-fit chi-square was used to calculate how well the 
data fit the model. For all statistical analyses, a p-value 
of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. 
All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS 
(IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 20.0, IBM 
Corp., Armonk, NY). 
Results 
Socio-demographic characteristics 
Socio-demographic characteristics of the sample are pre-
sented in Table I. Victims' age ranged from 12 to 25 
years, with a mean age of 16.7 years (SD =2.7) and a 
median age of 16.1 years. Victims' mean age at time of 
rape was 14.3 years (SD =2.7) and a median age of 13.9 
years. Penetration occurred in 79.6% of the cases. None 
of the victims reported prior chronic child sexual abuse. 
Data about victim—assailant relationship are presented in 
Table 2. Victims first disclosed after a mean 20.8 weeks 
(SD =56.8, range 1-624 weeks), although 58.5% of the 
cases told within 1 week. First disclosure was to a friend 
(45.8%), parent(s) (17.1%), (ex) boy-friend (9.4%), family 
member (6.8%), professional (5.8%), or other adult 
(15.2%). With regard to post-rape services, 53.8% of all 
victims consulted a doctor for medical care and 51.4% 
reported to the police. On average, victims were admitted 
to the centre 59.8 weeks post-rape (SD =93.7, range 
1-676). The mean GSI of the rape victims on the SCL-90-
R (Al = 209.7, SD = 61.8) was comparable with previously 
reported data of psychiatric populations [M=203.55, 
SD = 61.60; 4269) =1.629, p = 0.104] and was substantially

eral population (M=118.28, SD =32.38; Arrindell & 
Ettema, 1986). For the CDI, mean scores were in the 
clinical range (M=17.2, SD =4.6) and rape victims 
had significantly higher mean scores (1(230)=15,923, 
p <0.001), in comparison to previously reported data of 
the general population of adolescent girls (Timbremont, 
Braet, & Roelofs, 2008; M=9.01, SD =6.45). 
Differences between early and delayed disclosers 
Fifty-nine percent of the sample consisted of early dis-
closers (disclosure within I week). No significant differ-
ences in demographic characteristics were found between 
early and delayed disclosers, except that there were 
more delayed disclosers in the age category 12-17 years 
compared to the early disclosers group (x2 (1) =6.96; 
p = 0.008). For rape characteristics, significant differences 
between groups were found for the use of penetration, 
with more victims of penetration in the delayed disclosers 
group compared to the early disclosers group (x2 (I) = 
5.37; p =0.02). Also, the delayed disclosers group pre-
sented more victims of verbal and/or weapon threats 
than the early disclosers group (x2 (I)=5.35; p =0.02). 
Furthermore, among the delayed disclosers more victims 
identified the assailant as a close person compared to the 
early disclosers (x2 (I) =10.84; p =0.001). Alcohol was 
used more often in the early disclosers group compared 
to the delayed disclosers group (x2 (I) =20.24;p <0.001). 
With respect to post-rape characteristics, a significantly 
smaller proportion of the delayed disclosers (15.9%) 
utilized medical services following the rape compared 
to the early disclosers (30.3%; z2 (1)=5.32; p =0.02). 
Similarly, a significantly smaller proportion of the delayed 
disclosers (14.6%) compared to the early disclosers 
(34.3%) reported the rape to the police (x2 (I) =16.15; 
p <0.001). The time since trauma at admission was sig-
nificantly lower for early disclosers (M=41.1 weeks, 
SD =79.4) than for delayed disclosers (M =82.9 weeks,

Predictors of delayed disclosise of rape 
SD =103.3: 4314) =4.06, p <0.001). Mean and median 
time to seek help were 37.7 and 12.0 weeks, respectively. 
Mean time to seek help did not differ between groups 
(1(309)=2.54, p <0.48). Excluding outliers (M±3 SD, 
N = II) did not change the outcome of this analysis. Both 
early and delayed disclosers scored in the highest level 
of psychological distress when compared to previously 
reported norm scores (CRTI, Alisic, Eland, Huijbregts, 
& Kleber, 2012; CDI, Timbremont et al., 2008; YSR, 
Achenbach & Rescorla, 2001; SCL-90, Arrindell & 
Ettema, 1986), but the MANCOVA results showed that 
when comparing multiple continuous psychological 
scores, the overall psychological functioning (posttrau-
matic stress, depression, behavioural problems, and gen-
eral psychopathology) did not differ significantly between 
early and delayed disclosers (F(6,I98) = 0.88, p =0.51). 
Table 3 shows the ORs with 95% Cls for the associa-
tions between potential risk factors and delayed disclosure. 
Delayed disclosers, when compared to early disclosers, 
were significantly more likely to be in the age category 
of 12-17 years (OR =2.10), to have experienced rape by 
a close person (OR = 2.35), to have been threatened 
verbally and/or with a weapon (OR =1.75), and to have 
experienced penetration (OR = 1.99). Delayed disclosers 
were also found less likely to have used alcohol prior to 
the rape (OR = 0.22). None of the other factors were 
found to be significant risk factors for delayed disclosure. 
Predicting delayed disclosure 
A stepwise forward LR analysis was conducted to predict 
delayed disclosure, using "age category," "close assailant," 
"use of threats," and "penetration" as predictors. Victims' 
alcohol use was not entered in the analysis because of 
missing values for 33.4% of the cases. The use of threats 
was not a significant predictor in the model. A test of the 
full model against a constant-only model was statistically 
significant, indicating that the predictors (i.e., age cate-
gory 12-17 years, close assailant, penetration) reliably 
distinguished between early and delayed disclosers (2 2
(3) = 23.09, p <0.000). There were no significant interac-
tions between the predictors. Nagelkerke's R2 of 10.5% 
suggests only a modest association between the predic-
tors and delayed disclosure, although the model did show 
an adequate fit to the data (Hosmer-Lemeshow x 2 (4) = 
2.77, p <0.60). In total, 62% of the respondents were 
categorized correctly, when using the three predictors 
that contributed significantly to the prediction of delayed 
disclosure: age category 12-17 years (OR 2.05, CI 1.13-
3.73), penetration (OR 2.36, CI 1.25-4.46), and closeness 
to the assailant (OR 2.64, CI 1.52-4.60). 
Discussion 
The results of this study show that, although no dif-
ferences were found between delayed and early disclosers 
in psychological functioning and time to seek help, 
delayed disclosers were less likely to use medical services 
and to report to the police than early disclosers. 
Furthermore, this study identified a number of factors 
related to the timing of rape disclosure, showing that 
delayed disclosers represented significantly more adoles-
cents than young adults, significantly more victims of 
penetration than assault, significantly more victims who 
were threatened than not threatened, and significantly 
more victims who were close with the assailant. 
The finding that delayed disclosers are less likely to 
utilize medical services and report to the police than early 
disclosers is in line with previous studies in adult women 
(Ahrens et al., 2010; Ullman, 1996; Ullman & Filipas, 
2001). It suggests that disclosure latency is important for 
public health and safety, as delayed disclosure may not 
only impede reception of proper medical care, such as 
treating anogenital injuries and preventing the onset of 
STDs and unwanted pregnancy (Linden, 2011), but also 
impede the forensic investigation and apprehension of the 
assailant (Lacy & Stark, 2013). 
Three variables were identified that successfully pre-
dicted delayed disclosure: age category 12-17 years, 
penetration, and the assailant being a close person. The 
finding that the victim's age significantly predicts disclo-
sure latency is in line with previous research showing that 
adolescents are at a greater risk for delayed disclosure 
when compared to their older counterparts (Kogan, 2004; 
Smith et al., 2000). Adolescents may be less able to over-
come the barriers to disclose, including factors such as 
assailant tactics for maintaining secrecy, stigma that often 
accompanies rape, and fear that their parents would 
consequently limit their freedom (Crisma, Bascelli, Paci, 
& Romito, 2004). Also, as victims approach adulthood, 
they may possess more information about their rights and 
options after victimization, and have more possibilities for 
whom to disclose. In our study, most adolescents disclosed 
the rape event to peers, in line with prior research (Crisma 
et al., 2004; Priebe & Svedin, 2008). 
The use of penetration was found to make victims 
more likely to postpone disclosure, opposite to the results 
from Priebe and Svedin (2008), but in line with an older 
study by Arata (1998), who found that more severe forms 
of sexual abuse were associated with less disclosure. 
Penetration may influence disclosure latency through 
a variety of mechanisms. It could be argued that more 
severe rape, indicated by the use of penetration, is more 
likely to be accompanied by extensive coercive use of 
tactics to maintain the victim's silence, with fear of re-
prisal possibly contributing to the finding of delayed dis-
closure (Kogan, 2004). Also, adolescents may think that 
social reactions in response to disclosure are more nega-
tive in case of completed rape compared to assault. 
Another factor that seems to make immediate dis-
closure of rape less likely is closeness to the assailant, 
as indicated by the assailant being a (boy)friend, family

between the victim and assailant, the less likely the young 
woman was to report this victimization to anyone (Koss,

Predictors of delayed disclosue of rape 
the explanation for delayed or non-disclosure (Kogan, 
2004; Smith et al., 2000). In the present study, however, 
only 5% of the assailants were identified as a family 
member. Most close relationships referred to (boy)friends, 
suggesting that a significant percentage of the sample 
experienced peer-to-peer victimization. This type of vic-
timization is most likely to occur during adolescence, as 
compared to childhood or young adulthood, and greatly 
increases the risk of revictimization (Humphrey & White, 
2000). Hence, victims of rape by peers may be a target 
group for interventions promoting early disclosure. 
Clearly, there are many variables working in tandem to 
affect the timing of victim's disclosure. A closer look at 
the final model, which identified three unique variables that 
contributed significantly to the prediction of delayed dis-
closure, can help us to better understand the phenomenon 
of initial disclosure in adolescents and young adults. 
Younger adolescent victims who are raped by a close per-
son are more likely to delay disclosure than older victims 
of attempted rape by a stranger or acquaintance. Perhaps, 
they struggle with the notion that someone close to them 
performed such a violent act against them, which con-
fuses them about what might happen in terms of safety 
if they would disclose (or not). This finding is especially 
important in the light of the fact that approximately 80% 
of victims had some sort of relationship with their per-
petrator prior to the assault (Basile, Chen, Black, & 
Saltzman, 2007). With regard to rape types, it would 
intuitively seem that less severe forms of sexual assault 
are associated with delayed disclosure and that completed 
rape would be easier to identify as clearly inappropriate 
and wrong. Victims of completed rape, however, may be 
more likely to experience negative psychological reac-
tions, e.g., self-blame and avoidance coping. It is con-
ceivable that they delay their disclosure as a result of 
rape-induced psychological distress (Starzynski, Ullman, 
Filipas, & Townsend, 2005), not necessarily the severity 
of the assault. 
Although the final model showed acceptable goodness 
of fit, the percentage of explained variance of delayed 
disclosure was modest. Thus. there must be other variables 
predictive of delayed disclosure, such as the assailant's 
use of alcohol or weaker support systems, that we did not 
assess in this study. Besides this limitation, there are other 
drawbacks of this study that should be mentioned. First, 
a clinical sample was used with patients reporting high 
mean levels of psychological distress. This ceiling effect 
may explain why no differences were found between 
early and delayed disclosers on psychological function-
ing, contrary to prior studies (Broman-Fulks et al., 2007; 
Ruggiero et al., 2004). Second, posttraumatic stress was 
only assessed for children up to 18 years, and for young 
adults additional suitable measures were not used. Third, 
information could have been lost due to dichotomizing 
the variable disclosure latency. Fourth, results may not be 
generalizable to all rape victims, because the percentage 
of victims that consulted a medical professional and 
reported to the police was higher in our sample than in 
most studies (Hanson et al., 2003; Resnick et al., 2000; 
Zinzow, Resnick, Bare, Danielson, & Kilpatrick, 2012). 
Perhaps, these differences could, at least partially, be 
explained by the fact that stranger rape, representing 30% 
of our sample, leads to higher likelihood of help-seeking 
and police reporting because of its association with higher 
acknowledgment of victim status (Resnick et al., 2000; 
Smith et al., 2000). The fact that this is a help-seeking 
sample is critical for the reasons cited in the discussion, 
but also because the generalizability of these data to rape 
victims who never tell anyone—perhaps the group most 
at risk—simply cannot be known. Besides these limita-
tions, several strengths of the current study need to be 
noted. One strength is the unique set of adolescents and 
young adults who presented at a mental health care 
centre after a single rape event, but who reported no prior 
chronic sexual abuse in childhood. For 85% of the 
sample, the index trauma was a first time rape. Moreover, 
data were collected at a designated referral centre for 
victims of rape and, therefore, the sample is likely to 
represent the clinical population of Dutch victims in the 
age group of 12-25 years. 
The findings of the current study, suggesting that 
delayed disclosers are less able to benefit from emergency 
medical care and evidence collection, have a number of 
practical implications. One of the strategies to enhance 
victims' willingness to disclose within the first week post-
rape may be sexual education campaigns in school and 
media, as being uninformed is one of the reasons for them 
not to disclose (Crisma et al., 2004). Education may 
include medical information on rape-related pregnancy 
and STDs, as well as the need for timely emergency 
contraception and prophylaxis, given that these concerns 
appear to be facilitators of seeking medical help (Zinzow 
et al., 2012). Also, practical information about DNA evi-
dence and how to best protect it, e.g., related to shower-
ing, clothing, eating, and drinking, may increase the 
awareness of opportunities in the early-phase post-rape. 
Moreover, facts about the potential psychological impact 
of rape, such as PTSD and revictimization, but also in-
formation about evidence-based treatments (Elwood et al., 
2011; Littleton & Ullman, 2013; McLaughlin et al., 2013), 
may increase help-seeking behaviour in an early stage. 
Furthermore, efforts to encourage early disclosure must 
consider peer-to-peer victimization as a primary factor, 
as most participants in this study experienced this type 
of victimization, and may initially not have defined or 
acknowledged the incident as rape because they rationalize 
such experiences as normal (Hlavka, 2014), leading to the 
finding of delayed disclosure. 
In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest 
that adolescent victims of rape with penetration by

someone close are at increased risk for delayed disclosure, 
and that delayed disclosers are less likely to use medical 
services and to report to the police. These findings may 
assist clinicians and policymakers in understanding rape 
and help to develop interventions (Unterhitzenberger & 
Rosner, 2014), specifically targeted to support adoles-
cents and young adults to disclose in an early-phase post-
rape. Although the vast majority of the participants was 
living at their parental home, many of the sample did 
not first disclose to their parents. Therefore, it could be 
argued that in prevention programs specific attention 
should be given to the strengthening of the child—parent 
relationship, to facilitate disclosure to parents (Schonbucher 
et al., 2012). Next, as victims tend to disclose mostly to 
peers, prevention programmes may need to aim at teach-
ing adolescents how they can help a peer victim if they 
become a recipient of disclosure (Schonbucher et al., 
2012). In addition, education may increase victims' 
willingness to disclose early, thereby increasing opportu-
nities for access to health and police services. It is more 
likely to reach adolescents with direct, active, and online 
outreach programs via communication channels that are 
frequently used by adolescents and young adults parti-
cularly social media (i.e., Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, 
etc.), forums, and mobile apps. Such programmes, where-
in adolescents and young adults are being treated as 
agents and decision makers (Hlavka, 2014), should focus 
on information concerning what rape actually is—not 
only the stereotypical idea of rape and what (not) to do in 
the aftermath of rape especially in the first week post-
rape. Another way to help improve the support of victims 
of rape is the implementation of multidisciplinary sexual 
assault centres (Bicanic, Snetselaar, De Jongh, & Van de 
Putte, 2014; Bramsen, Elklit, & Nielsen, 2009), as these 
may be the most suitable places to organize education 
campaigns and offer integrated post-rape services in one 
location. Future research should investigate whether the 
availability of such centres increases the prevalence of police 
reporting and use of medical care. Moreover, as discussed, 
previous research concerning the topic of disclosure has 
focused on the disclosure process, mainly the effect of 
negative social reactions, and not the latency. In future 
research, social reactions in relation to disclosure (latency) 
should be assessed by using the Social Reactions Ques-
tionnaire, as well as the victim's perception of their own 
experience being defined as rape, as many girls and young 
women do not report or seek help because they regard 
sexual violence against them as normal (Hlavka, 2014).

There are items that need to be picked up by the MDC. 
I have provided the tracking information.

Good evening -
During my in-person visit yesterday with Ms. Maxwell, the HEPA filters were not operating in the visiting room that I have 
been required 
EFTA00024228
--- PAGE 2 ---
to use, even when more than one attorney is present. The officers told me to use the larger, corner room. 
Previous requests to use this more ample corner room have been denied because the officers' claim 
the camera cannot be positioned. Yesterday, the officers simply and easily positioned the camera focused on the corner 
room. 
I am requesting that future in-person visits be conducted in the larger corner room. 
The previous reason for denying that request appears invalid. 
Also, legal mail sent to the MDC has not been picked up by the facility. See tracking information below. 
Please promptly provide an explanation and inform me when Ms. Maxwell will receive these deliveries. 
Thank you-

ORDER 
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
The Court is receipt of the parties' letters regarding the jury questionnaire and voir dire. 
See Dkt. Nos. 372, 373, 375. 
The Court will provide counsel the corresponding list of juror names and assigned juror 
numbers on November 16 at the commencement of voir dire. The placeholder for the juror 
information sheet in the Court's draft questionnaire refers to the information sheet required by 
the Jury Department. See Dkt. No. 365. The information sheet will be removed and collected by 
the Jury Department from the packet before the parties' review of the questionnaires. 
The Court is still considering the logistics of when peremptory strikes will be exercised, 
but the Court anticipates peremptory strikes will be exercised on November 29. Assuming so, the 
swearing in of the jury, preliminary instructions, and opening statements would commence 
immediately following the simultaneous (via submission of lists) exercise of peremptory 
challenges. 
SO ORDERED.

is strictly prohibited. 
The Court anticipates seating capacity in the overflow rooms for at least 100 members of 
the public. If capacity is reached, no additional persons will be admitted. Per the S.D.N.Y.

Dear Counsel: 
Today we are producing the materials listed in the below index. These materials are 
stamped with control numbers SDNY_GM_02765768 through SDNY_GM_02767073. 
Please note that both this letter and the enclosed materials are governed by the July 31, 
2020 Protective Order in this case. This letter is itself designated as "confidential," because it 
includes information regarding records designated as "confidential" under the Protective 
Order. The Department of Justice directed this office to cease the dissemination of materials 
marked with the word "confidential" in order to avoid potential confusion with markings reserved 
for classified documents. Accordingly, in order to note the appropriate designation of this 
production under the operative Protective Order in this case, the materials being produced today 
are marked with the following label: "SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER PARAGRAPHS 7, 
8, 9, 10, 15, and 17." This marking directly refers to the specific paragraphs of the Protective 
Order that govern today's production. 
An index of the materials contained in this production is below:

Subject: Some will question: U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan and Prosecutor's Office 
Some will question: How does America judge the degree of underage sex trafficking? 
If a wealthy man and/or organization pays for airline tickets, hotel accommodations, and food for underage 
teens to which results in the underage girls being paraded on stage in nothing more than what is deemed 'not 
much more than lingerie'... eventually resulting in some of the underage girls possibly having sex with anyone 
18+ and/or -18... possibly straight sex and/or lesbian sex, surely the wealthy individual and/or organization is 
guilty of underage sex trafficking to some degree. 
While some will argue such cases are not to the extent of underage sex trafficking such as what unfolded in 
the case of Jeffrey Epstein -both Lolita Island and U.S. gatherings, the argument of presentation cannot be 
debated, a degree of sex trafficking occurred during what is considered 'Miss Teen USA Contests.' 
There is a grooming involved within beauty pageants, is there not? The payment by a wealthy individual 
and/or organization offering various teenage girls the 'flamboyant freedom of opportunity for sex behind 
pageant doors' is surely 'a hidden secret' which has taken place, has it not? 
Had the underage girls not been offered the 'flamboyant freedom of opportunity' through the guise of a 
beauty pageant then, cases of -perhaps most likely, lesbian sex between underage girls would not have been 
given the time nor, the place for such sex vacations to occur. If such sex vacations occur then, surely it is a form 
of sex trafficking being set into place... into reality by the wealthy individual and/or pageant organization. 
While chains, threats, freedom, etc... is perhaps not a form of physical sex trafficking to which often times 
associated with sex trafficking, if sex -especially underage sex of any manner at beauty pageant gatherings, 
occurs then, this sex trafficking has occurred. 
Has anyone ever questioned past teen beauty contestants as to how many of them were sexually involved -
either with those 18+ and/or -18... with either those within and/or around the pageants... with male or female, 
during pageant gatherings? 
EFTA00024265
--- PAGE 2 ---
If indeed any form of sexual involvement occurred then, in fact, sex trafficking occurred under the guise of 
'flamboyant freedom of opportunity' presented by the beauty pageant owners. A grooming for the world of 
high-dollar prostitution is what many can potentially perceive beauty pageants and modeling shows to be. 
NOTE: Obviously, wording of beauty pageants can also be replaced with modeling shows. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVri5KhzFcM 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8czVPrRkWk 
Miss Teen beauty pageants have been places of 'underage grooming.' 
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/17/nyregion/ghislaine-maxwell-grooming.html
In order to help ensure Ghislaine Maxwell's day in court -not only for her and her lawyers to defend herself 
through the legal system, too potentially expose corrupt sex traffickers and, perhaps at this point, to expose the 
active participants within the deceased Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking saga. Those active participants might very 
well be high-ranking wealthy politicians and government officials and, socialites typically associated with 
Hollywood and the wealthy circles throughout America and, the world. 
Ghislaine Maxwell's health and well-being should be extremely important to all women -young and old, in 
order to help ensure injustice is not a continuous practice as in the past while justice is upheld even against 
those who have thus far been shielded due to political power and/or wealth. 
Such is the reason bail should be granted to Ghislaine Maxwell in order to help ensure her appearance before 
the Court and, before the Nation does not end prior in such an ill-manner of injustice to which befall upon 
Jeffrey Epstein to which many question the government's ruling of death based upon questioning any cover-up 
by those in positions of power. 
Having an individual alive for justice to be rendered -guilty or innocent within a Court of Law, is a far more 
demanding form of Law than having an individual confined behind bars -with a great risk of death for silence, 
until their day in court... perhaps eventually for the political elite if Ghislaine Maxwell is alive and well while 
finally accepting, her voice must be spoken in truth and honesty... including a forthrightness even at this point 
in time in order to prevent the freedom of those within political power and wealthy socialite houses to continue 
abusing their positions of power based upon wealth against young girls and, young women of all ages. 
Again, I petition America and, the Courts of Manhattan to grant Ghislaine Maxwell bail for the security of her 
voice... hopefully her forthright voice to be heard in court. 
Plenty of stories have been revealed around media and former contestants, Donny Trump had employees 
attempting to groom underage girls for him during Miss Teen USA pageants... as have Donny Trump and Billy 
Clinton connections with Epstein and Maxwell.

Subject: For the Prosecutor's Office and/or US District Judge Alison Nathan... 
For the Prosecutor's Office and/or US District Judge Alison Nathan to deny Bail Request, denial could 
potentially place the weight of injustice upon all women -both young and old, if Ghislaine Maxwell becomes 
another Jeffrey Epstein jail statistic based upon any possibility of any high-ranking politicians/government 
officials around the world and wealthy socialites seeking her silence. 
I encourage both the Prosecutor's Office and the Court to grant Ghislaine Maxwell Bail -based upon 
stipulations I have noted within previous email (included below], in order for Ghislaine Maxwell to be given the 
opportunity to take the stand -not only in defense of the charges filed against Ms. Maxwell, also those whom 
were 'protected' by the death of Jeffrey Epstein. 
Jails simply do not provide healthy environments for those Innocent Until Proven Guilty in a Court of Law... 
especially a Court Case of such magnitude which stands possibly for any and all youth deemed 'underage' by 
U.S. Law. 
Any possibly Flight Risk can be avoided based upon Bail Agreement. 
Requesting Bail be granted for the health & well-being of Ghislaine Maxwell in order for Court to be upheld in 
Truth and Justice.

Subject: FORWARD ASAP... ATTN: US District Judge Alison Nathan 
US District Judge Alison Nathan, 
I recommend the US District Court in Manhattan accept Ghislaine Maxwell's bail application offering 
of $28.5 million... with the following stipulations: 
EFTA00024267
--- PAGE 4 ---
<24 Full-time Security Guards on premises*** [i.e. 12 guards rotating shifts every 8 hours] RV Camper 
residences on premises. 
<Each Security Guard is paid directly by Ghislaine Maxwell Escrow $20,000 monthly salary per 
Security Guard 
NOTE: Escrow prepaid 6-months in full [i.e. $480,000/month (x) pre-paid every 6-months = 
$2,880,000] 
NOTE: Escrow pre-paid prior to release on bail. 
NOTE: After six months, if additional 6-month Escrow is failed to be pre-paid, bail immediately 
revoked. 
NOTE: If Court determines 36 Security Guards, Escrow amount increases -as does number of RV 
campers on premises by six. 
<First 3-months, Hourly Skype Chat w/Court Employee of Judge's decision within 10 minutes prior to 
or, following-top-of the-hour 
NOTE: Offer a pre-agreed 7-hour sleep exclusion Hourly Skype Chat timeframe 
<Ankle Monitor 24/7/365 or, duration of Bail Term until completion of Case 
NOTE: This effort helps ensure Ghislaine Maxwell's safety based upon possible Lolita Island ties to 
high-ranking Officials... anyone connected with Jeffrey Epstein. 
NOTE: Also saves tax dollars in comparison to jail confinement costs [i.e. 10% Forfeiture of Bail 
Amount upon Court Case Ruling] 
NOTE: Based upon old-school "Innocent until Proven Guilty in a Court of Law." 
For Bail Acceptance, based upon me -Greg Hirsch, being without work and, being unable to find any 
companies interested in my CAEF endeavors, I ask to be employed as one of the Security Guards. 
***If property still owned or, similar property, Ghislaine Maxwell pays for twelve RV campers 
strategically situated around property within 10' chain link fence around premises location at [as shown 
on Google Maps]: 
E Washington Road 
Bradford, New Hampshire 
NOTE: RV campers and 10* chain link fence paid in full and, set in place and, fence erected prior to 
prisoner/accused released on bail.

Subject: RE:

I spoke with =. 
Bottom line, she thinks it's a close call between making 
take a felony plea and declining to 
prosecute, but she ultimately comes down in favor of a felony plea. She does not think we should charge 
with sex 
trafficking. 
I= 
asked me to send her and I= a draft of the summary of their views that we plan to send up to the brass. Below is 
what I'd propose: 
Our Office's Human Trafficking Coordinators have reviewed the prosecution team's Update Memo as well as 
submission, and are aware of the details of the Epstein investigation. In the Coordinators' experience, our Office 
ordinarily would decline to prosecute a victim-participant like 
absent certain aggravating factors, such as the use of 
violence by the victim-participant on others, or the victim-perpetrator continuing to run a sex trafficking operation in the 
absence of her abuser. Because those aggravating factors are not present here, the Coordinators believe it is a very close 
call between declining to prosecute 
and requiring 
to enter a felony plea. Ultimately, though, the 
Coordinators support a felony plea disposition along the lines set forth in 
submission given the unique 
circumstances of her case. In particular, the Coordinators believe that the large number of underage victims, together 
with 
obstructive conduct, warrant a felony plea. The Coordinators support such a disposition, in part, because a 
plea will allow victims to gain a sense of closure and to have their voices heard at sentencing if they choose. Given the 
mitigating factors presented in 
submission—most notably the sexual abuse she suffered at Epstein's hands—the 
Coordinators do not believe that our Office should charge 
with sex trafficking. 
What do you think?

Hello 
— sorry for the delay but I have been trying to get a handle on who is coming for the meeting etc. 
is a victim that I think will be helpful to your continuing investigation. She is working hard with your 
victims' coordinator to see if she can get here for the meeting. If she gets her passport/visa clearance and gets to the US 
then we could do an interview on the afternoon of Tuesday October 22rd starting at 2:00 if that works. I think she will 
probably take a bit longer because she was brought to the US by Epstein a number of times so maybe a lot 2 hours for the 
interview (from 2-4). 
is going to be attending the meeting and she said she could interview with you right after the 
meeting. I believe the notice says the meeting starts at 10:00 on October 23rd so maybe we plan to meet you at 12:00 
depending on the length of the victims' meeting. 
also wanted to come to the meeting. I know you met with her for a short while. If you would like to meet 
with her for a more detailed interview we could do that on the afternoon of October 22nd from 4 — 6 if that works.

She would like to try to attend via skype or some kind of conference line.

If you would like to also interview 
I can set something up.

We will make ourselves available to meet with your new client on 10/23. Because the victim meeting is being run by the

Gloria, 
We just needed a little time to rearrange schedules, as we had planned to do noon to 1:00 based on your 
request. However we will plan to come to your office as soon as the meeting this morning is concluded, 
including any individual questions that occur immediately after the general presentation, which occurred but 
was relatively limited following the corresponding meeting in Florida last week. My hope is that we'll be able 
to get to your office by 11:30, and we can email to let you know that we're on our way if that's helpful. 
Alternatively, if you and 
would prefer to meet at the FBI, that should be fine, you just may have to wait 
for a few minutes following the meeting. We can discuss either way this morning in person, but the upshot is 
that we'll meet with you as soon as possible after the meeting. 
thanks,

Is there a place at the FBI for you to interview 
at the end of the meeting with Victim Services ? I am on a tight 
schedule tomorrow. Please advise if you want to interview her there at 11:A.M or 11:30.at the end of their meeting or 
do wish to use my office at 305 Broadway? I need to leave the interview with her by 12:30. I must take the 2P.M. train

Again in connection with the Epstein investigation (2018R01618), we'd like to please request permission to travel next 
week for a victim interview in Los Angeles. As of now we tentatively expect to fly down Wednesday and return no later 
than Friday (and will keep the timeframe as short as scheduling allows). The trip will be some combination of me,

Again in connection with the Epstein investigation, we'd like to please request permission to travel for approximately 
three days next week for meetings and interviews in West Palm Beach, Florida. As of now we tentatively expect to fly 
down Tuesday night and return on Wednesday or Thursday (and will keep the timeframe as short as scheduling allows). 
Unfortunately we're still trying to pin down timing for interviewing the victims, so depending on the timing it will either 
be me and 
or 
and 
but we wanted to ask for permission now either way so we weren't doing it 
super last minute after the holiday on Tuesday. And also same as last time, we'd like to ask permission to reserve a 
conference room at the hotel for the interviews, please.

of, will be your surviving spouse, or your estate if you do not have a surviving spouse. If you 
designate a spouse as your beneficiary, the subsequent divorce or termination of the marriage 
will automatically revoke the designation. You can designate your former spouse as 
beneficiary by completing a new change of beneficiary form.

Investors should read the prospectus carefully before investing in a fund. 
The Sweep Funds are Not FDIC insured. May lose value. No bank guarantee. 
A prospectus for each Sweep Fund may be found at

Advisor for a copy of a prospectus.

Agreements and Disclosures Pages for more information. 
Automatic Exchanges of Certain Sweep Funds 
Different Sweep Funds may be offered to clients who have Marketing Relationship assets with 
UBS of $25 million or more or who otherwise meet requirements established by UBS in its sole 
discretion. If you meet this asset threshold and own shares of the UBS RMA Government 
Money Market Fund through any of the UBS sweep programs, you will become eligible for the 
UBS Select Government Capital Fund and we will liquidate your shares in the UBS RMA 
Government Money Market Fund and purchase shares in the UBS Select Government Capital 
Fund without direction from, or prior notice to, you. Thereafter, the UBS Select Government 
Capital Fund will be your Sweep Option (or Secondary Sweep Option, as the case may be). 
Once a first purchase has been made into the fund, the UBS Select Government Capital Fund 
will remain your Sweep Option (or Secondary Sweep Option) even if your Marketing 
Relationship assets cease to meet the minimum asset thresholds for the UBS Select 
Government Capital Fund. 
Your eligibility for the UBS Select Government Capital Fund will be determined at the end of 
each month, based on the value of your Marketing Relationship assets as determined in the 
sole discretion of UBS. If the value of your Marketing Relationship assets reaches the minimum 
asset threshold at any time other than the end of the month, you will not be eligible for the 
UBS Select Government Capital Fund. 
The Puerto Rico Fund 
The Puerto Rico Fund is offered as a Sweep Option (and Secondary Sweep Option) exclusively 
to residents of Puerto Rico as defined in that fund's prospectus and is not available as a Sweep 
Option for tax-deferred accounts such as IRAs and Plans and Participants. The Puerto Rico 
Fund is not a money market fund registered under the U.S. Investment Company Act 
of 1940, as amended, does not comply with rules applicable to U.S. registered funds 
and presents a higher degree of risk than those funds. The Puerto Rico Fund is not 
FDIC insured, may lose value and has no bank guarantee. The Puerto Rico Fund is sold 
by prospectus only, which may be found at 
wirvw.ubs.com/us/en/wealth/misr/puertorirofundc or from your Financial Advisor. 
Margin Agreement and Margin Requirements 
All Accounts that you open now or in the future will be established with margin, if eligible, 
unless you instruct us that you do not want margin privileges for specific Accounts. By signing 
the Signature Page for any Account except for an ERISA Plan, you agree that the Margin 
Agreement governs your use of margin in all of your current Accounts and any eligible 
Accounts that you may open in the future. 
Therefore, if you do not establish margin privileges when you open an Account and later 
decide to use margin, you may be able to do so without signing additional forms. Likewise, if 
you cancel your margin privileges on an Account, your Margin Agreement with us will remain 
in effect and you may request to use margin again at any time. In either event, we will confirm 
your request. 
When you use your margin privileges, we hold your securities in your Account as collateral 
against the amounts you borrow, and your securities may be loaned to UBS or to others as 
described in the Margin Agreement. In addition, margin-eligible Accounts are subject to 
applicable statutes, rules, regulations, procedures or industry customs. We may deem it 
necessary or advisable to establish additional requirements for margin accounts. You agree to 
maintain sufficient assets to satisfy all applicable statutes, rules or regulations, or as we deem 
If you do not want to establish margin for 
your current accounts or any accounts you 
open in the Mum, please contact your 
Financial Advisor. 
Please note: 185 does not extend margin 
for the following accounts:

necessary or advisable. You also agree to maintain sufficient assets in your Account to satisfy 
any and all margin calls issued in connection with the Account. 
As long as your Account is a margin account, you authorize UBS in the usual course of 
business to lend, pledge as collateral, hypothecate, relend or repledge any Property we carry 
for you on margin, whether separately or together with Property of others, either to ourselves 
or to others. This authorization remains in effect until we receive payment for such Property. 
When you use your margin privileges, as permitted by law, we may use certain securities in 
your Account for, among other things, settling short sales and lending securities for short 
sales. We may receive and retain compensation in connection with such transactions. If you are 
engaged in short selling a security, you may incur a charge due to certain borrowing costs for 
that particular security. 
Subject to applicable rules and regulations, we may amend the requirements applicable to your 
margin account at any time in our sole and absolute discretion, including, without limitation, 
changing the level of credit available to you and applicable maintenance requirements; all 
without notice to you. A prior demand or call, or prior notice of the time and place of such 
sale or purchase shall not be considered a waiver of our right to sell or buy without demand or 
notice as described herein. For additional terms, please refer to the section 'Liquidation of 
Collateral or Account" below. 
We have the right to satisfy a margin call or to require or obtain full or partial payment of a 
margin loan at any time without a demand for margin or additional margin or other notice. To 
satisfy a margin call or to obtain full or partial payment of the margin loan, in addition to all 
rights provided by law, we have the right to: 
1. 
require additional collateral, 
2. 
sell any Property in any of your Accounts with us, whether carried individually or 
jointly with others, 
3. 
buy any Property which may be held short in your Account, 
4. 
cancel any open orders and dose any or all outstanding contracts, or 
S. 
liquidate any of your Accounts with us. 
We may also exercise these rights at any time in our sole and absolute discretion. 
If you are an individual (including an individual acting as trustee of a trust) residing in or 
located in any country in the European Economic Area: you represent and warrant that you do 
not intend to use any part of a margin loan, and will not now or in the future use any part of a 
margin loan, for the acquiring or retaining of property rights in land or in an existing or 
projected building, or for the renovation of residential property. 
You understand that there are substantial risks involved in trading securities on 
margin, using leverage as a liquidity source or as part of your investment strategy, or 
otherwise pledging your securities in order to obtain credit. Please review the Loan 
Disclosure Statement included in the Agreements and Disclosures booklet carefully 
for a detailed discussion of these risks. 
Security Interest 
As security for the payment of all liabilities or indebtedness presently outstanding or to be 
incurred under this or any other agreement between you and any UBS Entity, including but not

UBS Entity a security interest in and lien on any and all Property held or carried by any UBS 
Entity for you or on your behalf in or credited to any UBS Account(s) (other than qualified plan 
or IRA accounts or other accounts where doing so would be a prohibited transaction or 
violation of applicable law or regulation) and in any other Account with any UBS Entity in 
which you may have any legal, equitable or other interest. 
All such Property will be subject to such security interest as collateral for the discharge of your 
obligations to any UBS Entity, wherever or however arising and without regard to whether or 
not we made loans with respect to that Property. In enforcing our security interest, we have 
the discretion to determine the amount, order and manner in which the Property will be sold

and have all the rights and remedies available to a secured party under the Uniform 
Commercial Code (UCC) in addition to all other rights provided in this Agreement or by law. 
You will not cause or allow any of the Property held in any of your UBS Accounts, whether 
owned now or acquired later, to be or become subject to any liens, security interests, 
mortgages or encumbrances of any nature other than our security interest, without our prior 
written consent. Each UBS Entity shall act as agent for and on behalf of each UBS Entity for 
purposes of perfecting, maintaining and enforcing the security interests granted hereunder or 
by operation of law. Each UBS Entity acting in the capacity of a deposit bank, securities 
intermediary or commodities intermediary, agrees to follow the instructions and entitlement 
orders of every other UBS Entity with respect to the Property as a secured party without 
further consent by you. You hereby authorize and direct each UBS Entity to follow the 
instructions and entitlement orders of every other UBS Entity. 
Liquidation of Collateral or Account 
We may satisfy any and all amounts you owe us in connection with any of your Accounts 
or agreements with us, or any other agreement between you and any UBS Entity, including 
but not limited to any loans, credit lines, promissory notes or tax obligations, from Property 
we hold or carry in any of your Accounts with us (other than qualified plan or IRA accounts 
or other accounts where doing so would be a prohibited transaction or violation of 
applicable law or regulation). Additionally, we may sell any or all Property held in any of 
your Accounts with us and cancel any open orders for the purchase or sale of any Property 
without notice in the event of your death or dissolution, bankruptcy or whenever in our 
sole and absolute discretion we deem it necessary for our protection. In these instances, 
we may also borrow or buy-in all Property held in any of your Accounts required to make 
delivery against any sale initiated for you. These sales or purchases may be public or private 
and may be made without advertising or notice to you and in the manner we determine in 
our sole discretion. You waive diligence, presentment, protest, demand for payment and 
notice of nonpayment and further waive all other notices and formalities to which you may 
be entitled under applicable law or otherwise, to the extent the waiver of such notices and 
other formalities is permissible under applicable law. Your waiver will not be invalidated by 
any demands, calls, tenders or notices that we may make. At any sale, we may purchase 
the Property or any portion thereof free of any right of redemption and you will remain 
liable for any deficiency in any of your Accounts, plus any accrued interest on the 
deficiency at our then customary rate, if applicable, or at the maximum rate allowable by 
law. We will not be liable to you in any way for any losses or adverse tax consequences 
resulting from a liquidation of your Property.

prohibit or restrict trading of any securities held in your Account, prohibit or restrict 
disbursements from your Account, and refuse to enter into any purchase or sale 
transaction with you regarding any securities that we deem high risk from a regulatory 
perspective, even if those securities were purchased by you through us. In addition, you 
understand that we maintain the right not to custody any such securities and deliver these 
securities to you at your expense.

depositories to obtain reduced tax withholding rates, to comply with local law or to respond to 
other lawful requests.

person in the event that we have concerns or questions about you, including but not limited to 
your health, well-being or whereabouts. You further authorize UBS to discuss our concerns

by the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to such State's choice of law or 
conflict of laws provisions. The Agreement is binding on you and on UBS Financial Services Inc.

with the Federal securities laws or the Federal or State banking laws. In connection with any

law designated by the Card Issuer in that Cardholder Agreement. 
In the event that any of the Arbitration provisions below are found to be unenforceable, you 
submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York and the Federal 
courts sitting in the Southern District of New York for the purpose of determining all matters 
with regard to the Agreement. You also consent to service of process by certified mail to your 
Account's address of record, and you waive any objection to the venue and any claims that an 
action or proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient forum. If any provision of the 
Agreement is held to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in 
full force and will be construed to the fullest extent permitted by law, to give effect to the 
intent of any provision that has been called into question.

This Agreement contains a predispute arbitration clause. By signing an arbitration agreement 
the parties agree as follows: 
GO 
All parties to this Agreement are giving up the right to sue each other in court, 
including the right to a trial by jury, except as provided by the rules of the 
arbitration forum in which a claim is filed. 
ao 
Arbitration awards are generally final and binding; a party's ability to have a court 
reverse or modify an arbitration award is very limited. 
ao 
The ability of the parties to obtain documents, witness statements and other 
discovery is generally more limited in arbitration than in court proceedings. 
ao 
The arbitrators do not have to explain the reason(s) for their award, unless, in an 
eligible case, a joint request for an explained decision has been submitted by all 
parties to the panel at least 20 days prior to the first scheduled hearing date. 
to 
The panel of arbitrators will typically include a minority of arbitrators who were or 
are affiliated with the securities industry. 
to 
The rules of some arbitration forums may impose time limits for bringing a claim in 
arbitration. In some cases, a claim that is ineligible for arbitration may be brought in 
court. 
This Arbitration Agreement represents 
standard industry practice and binds you 
and UBS Financial Services Inc. or UBS 
Financial Services Incorporated of Puerto 
Rico to arbitrate any &agreements that 
may arise between the parties. 
"The parties' for purposes of this 
arbitration agreement, are LOBS Financial

Financial Services Inc. and UBS Financial Service Incorporated of Puerto Rico agree as follows: 
To resolve any controversy, claim or issue in any controversy that may arise between 
you and UBS Financial Services or UBS Financial Services Incorporated of Puerto Rico

was executed, including but not limited to controversies, claims or issues in any 
controversy concerning any account, transaction, dispute or the construction, 
performance or breach of this Agreement or any other agreement. 
co 
Any arbitration under this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration 
Act and shall be conducted before an arbitration panel convened by the Financial 
Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) or any other national securities exchange's 
arbitration forum, upon which UBS Financial Services Inc. or UBS Financial Services 
Incorporated of Puerto Rico is legally required to arbitrate the controversy with you, 
including, where applicable, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board. 
co 
Such arbitration shall be governed by the rules of the organization convening the

The award of the arbitration panel is not subject to appeal and judgment upon the 
award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. 
co 
No person shall bring a putative or certified class action to arbitration nor seek to 
enforce any pre-dispute arbitration Agreement against any person who has initiated 
in court a putative dass action; or who is a member of a putative class who has not 
opted out of the class with respect to any claims encompassed by the putative class 
action until: 
— 
the class certification is denied; or 
— 
the class is decertified; or 
the customer is excluded from the class by the court. Such forbearance 
to enforce an agreement to arbitrate shall not constitute a waiver of any 
rights under this agreement except to the extent stated herein. 
You expressly agree that service of process in any action shall be sufficient if served 
by certified mail, return receipt requested, at your last address known to UBS. 
You expressly waive any defense to service of process as set forth above.

Who is his lead counsel? The Warden is preparing the formal letter for the Court, in which your office, the USMS, USPO, and 
lead counsel are cc'ed. Do you have an email address for him/her?

It is frankly unbelievable to me that BOP is issuing public press releases on this before telling us basic information so that we 
can relay it to his attorneys who can relay it to his family. When can we expect to get either some sort of statement we can 
pass along to counsel as accurate and reliable or have a call with someone? 
I understand from the Marshals that they have been unsuccessful in reaching anyone with authority at BOP, and given the 
BOP press release that was just put out I assume we need to speak with someone there. Please advise. 
Thank you.

Hello, 
I'm a reporter at Insider, and I'm writing to you because I'm working on a story that discusses some 
aspects of the federal criminal case against Jeffrey Epstein. 
I specifically wanted to ask if any member of the prosecution or a spokesperson for them would be 
willing to discuss the government's investigation of Epstein's potential ties to foreign governments, as 
evidenced by its inquiries into his expired Austrian passport and his potential citizenship in other 
countries. (This is in the context of a larger story about his travels to the Middle East.) 
Would any of you be willing to talk to me about this aspect of the case? 
My working deadline is Friday at noon, Eastern Time, but there is some flexibility if you need more 
time. I'm happy to hop on the phone, too, if that's more convenient. 
Thanks, 
Keenan

Following up on the below, wanted to make sure the attached letter from the Warden immediately got to Mike as well 
(in addition to Marty and Reid having been copied and emailed). As the letter indicates, there are now investigations 
ongoing, including as initiated by the Attorney General himself. Separately, we have not received additional information 
on topics such as the apparent cause of death, the status of observation of Mr. Epstein at the time, etc., but we will 
continue to be in touch immediately if that changes.

Mike, Marty, Reid, 
Following up on my conversations with Mike and Marty this morning, and my discussion with Mike moments 
ago, attached is a press release just sent to us (and I believe also issued publicly) some minutes ago. It 
represents all the information we have from BOP so far, but of course if we are successful in our continuing 
efforts to get additional information we will pass it along immediately. 
Separately, we can tell you that the reports that an FBI investigation into the death has been initiated are 
accurate, and I fully expect that investigation to be extremely rigorous. 
As always please don't hesitate to reach out to us directly at any time if that would be useful. 
thank you,

We talked about the agent's timing, so I wanted to let you know that the plane that will fly the agents down (48 agents in 
total) will take off at 9 a.m. tomorrow. If it is at all possible to know from Judge Miller before then whether she is 
prepared to sign the application, our team would be very grateful. 
As we just discussed, I'm attaching a copy of the application that highlights the paragraphs that were revised. I've also 
attached a slightly updated clean version of the draft, which fixes a small typo I saw (which is also fixed in the highlighted 
version). 
Thanks,

Thanks again for your help today, and for being flexible while we evaluated how to proceed today. Attached is the revised 
application. The exhibits are the same as before, but I'm attaching them again just so you have the complete package. I'll 
call you in a moment to discuss logistics.

morning, if at all possible 
Thanks very much—

Thanks for being available today and for getting the wheels turning for an investigation into how he died. 
On a related note, we are hearing that Jeffrey's autopsy may occur tomorrow morning. We would like to have a 
pathologist present for his autopsy and cannot line up someone on such short notice. Is there any way to push 
the autopsy off until Tuesday to give us time to do that?

Following up on the below, wanted to make sure the attached letter from the Warden immediately got to Mike as well (in 
addition to Marty and Reid having been copied and emailed). As the letter indicates, there are now investigations 
ongoing, including as initiated by the Attorney General himself. Separately, we have not received additional information 
on topics such as the apparent cause of death, the status of observation of Mr. Epstein at the time, etc., but we will 
continue to be in touch immediately if that changes.

Mike, Marty, Reid, 
Following up on my conversations with Mike and Marty this morning, and my discussion with Mike moments 
ago, attached is a press release just sent to us (and I believe also issued publicly) some minutes ago. It represents 
all the information we have from BOP so far, but of course if we are successful in our continuing efforts to get 
additional information we will pass it along immediately. 
Separately, we can tell you that the reports that an FBI investigation into the death has been initiated are 
accurate, and I fully expect that investigation to be extremely rigorous. 
As always please don't hesitate to reach out to us directly at any time if that would be useful.

a court proceeding yesterday which could have given him bad news regarding his legal situation. Inmate EpStein 
returned from court after duty hours yesterday evening and staff notified the on-call psychologist. Inmate Epstein was 
placed on a precautionary psychological observation status until psychology could interview him this morning to conduct 
a formal suicide risk assessment in order to determine whether he is curen0y at-risk for suicidality. 
Plannostic Formulation 
Inmate Epstein has no history of mental health problems and does not exhibit suicidality at this time. He has never 
received inpatient or outpatient mental health treatment and denied any history of sulcidality. Currently, he does not 
exhibit any acute psychopathology, is currently psychologically stable and is in no psychological distress. As such, he is 
being classified as a CC1-MH inmate at this time. CARE1-MH is indicative of an inmate who either has no 
ntifiable 
mental illness (Axis I "No Diagnosis') or is mildly ill and requires clinical Intervention on an as-needed basis. 
Care Level Formulation 
CARE1-MH is indicative of an inmate who shows no significant level of functional impairment associated wi a mental 
illness and demonstrates no need for regular mental health intervention. 
Diagnosis: 
No Diagnosis, No Dx - Current

Initially, we propose that the lawyers (myself, my colleagues at Akin Gump, and someone from DB Legal) deliver a 
presentation that provides an overview of Epstein's relationship with the bank, the different accounts affiliated with 
Epstein and the types of transactions found in the accounts. We would also highlight various transactions that we have 
noted in our internal investigation. Our aim is that the attorney proffer would help you in sifting through the records we 
have provided so you can more readily identify whatever information you are most interested in. Following the proffer, if 
there are particular accounts or transactions of interest, we can identify the person within DB who can best answer 
questions on those areas and that person would then meet with you. 
In terms of timing, I estimate 2-3 hours for the attorney proffer. (I think closer to 2 hours but I hate to underestimate.)

Parvin, 
Could you please let us know what format we should expect in terms of the proffer? That will help us with figuring out 
scheduling. I.e., do you expect to make an attorney proffer in the first instance, or should be expect to be meeting with 
Deutsche Bank personnel, etc? And approximately how long should we be planning to block out?

Hi MI —
The proffer may be helpful in guiding you through the production. That said, we can be available whenever makes most 
sense on your ends. 
We have time this week (Thursday or Friday afternoon) and next week (Monday — Wednesday), and we have time in 
September. If you give us a few options in terms of dates/times, we will sort out schedules on our ends.

Parvin, 
We received the index, thank you. In terms of a proffer, what generally did you have in mind regarding timing? I think 
we'd like to have some time with the subpoena returns to get familiarized, and our team has a combination of travel and 
trials in the next couple weeks, but we could do early September if that works on your end. Thoughts?

That makes good sense, thanks. Because of the scheduling issues I mentioned, we'd like to set it for a time in early 
September, if we can — is there a time during the afternoon of September 5 or the morning of September 6 that would 
work for you? We should be able to do either of those dates and times. Or if not, we can propose possible times the

counsel, but the attorneys we are aware of are:

Although the Government has made best efforts to notify victims of tomorrow's proceeding, the Government does not 
know which victims plan to attend tomorrow's conference, and it is possible that victims the Government is not aware 
of may attend. 
We have not copied defense counsel here, in order to respect the privacy of the victims. 
Respectfully, 
Assistant United States Attorney 
Southern District of New York 
New York, NY 10007

Subject: Jeffrey Epstein consultation fees 
Dear Madam, 
My late father John Kendall Rowlands was an art historian and art collector. He assisted Jeffrey Epstein in 
sourcing and disposing of works of art and may very well have loaned items to him as well. I understand that 
Jeffrey Epstein owed him a substantial sum of money in consultation fees in relation to works of art and that I 
would therefore have a claim on the estate in consideration of this. 
My father did mention in passing the presence of young girls with Jeffrey Epstein and had he not sadly died I 
expect my father would have reported his concerns to the relevant authorities 
I need to communicate with the US Attorney Geoffrey Berman in charge of the case against Jeffrey Epstein — can 
you therefore please pass this information on to him. My postal address is:-
David Rowlands

You're welcome. We will do our best to provide a call at 10:00 AM every day this week to Mr. Everdell at the number he has 
previously provided. We will also provide a call on Monday 7/13/20. 
The EDNY and SDNY created a joint protocol whereby counsel may request legal calls to be placed in the afternoon at the 
MDC. Requests should be sent to 
Truly urgent requests can be sent to me, but unless there is a last minute, imminent court deadline, counsel really should 
send the requests to the federal defenders, as outlined in the protocol. We want to ensure inmates get equitable access. If 
they anticipate needing several calls in a week, they should make requests in advance and note whether and when calls 
would be preferred. Generally, calls are for 30 minutes in duration. If a longer call is desired, that should be explained as well. 
If you need anything else, please let me know. 
Thank you,

A 10am standing legal call every day before the arraignment on Tuesday 7/14 would be perfect if that's something you 
would be able to accommodate. Defense counsel will be available at that time, and they are very grateful for the time. 
We have also conveyed to defense counsel that they will need to follow the same protocols as other inmates' counsel 
following the arraignment. Thank you for letting us know about the lack of requests from defense counsel thus far. There 
appears to be some confusion on their end about how to submit requests to schedule legal calls. Would you be able to 
please share with us the procedure that they should follow, so that we can make sure they understand what steps to take 
going forward? 
Thank you again for all of your help—we really appreciate it.

You're welcome. 
Would 10 am work as a standing legal call through the end of this week (and Monday, if you think that's a good idea), in 
advance of the arraignment on Tuesday? However, after this, defense counsel should be required to follow the same 
protocols as all other inmates' counsel with respect to requesting legal calls. 
I also just want to make clear that defense counsel sent no requests yesterday that I am aware of, and we were able to 
facilitate a call yesterday evening following a request from your office, and today, I received one request, about mid-day, 
that we were again able to accommodate. So, I do not think it is fair at all to categorize this as defense counsel having 
difficulty scheduling legal calls.

This is about the legal call today. In addition, because defense counsel his having difficulty scheduling legal 
calls, it would be helpful if MDC could schedule standing calls for the rest of this week to address this issue. Thanks very

If you believe you are a victim of GHISLAINE MAXWELL, from during any time period and in any location, please contact 
the Victim / Witness specialists at the U.S. Attorney's Office listed below. 
The charges are contained in Indictment 20 Cr. 330 (AJN). You may view a copy of the Indictment here. 
Updates regarding the progress of this case will be posted on this site. 
The United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York is committed to protecting the rights of crime 
victims. If you believe you are a victim of the offense charged, our Victim/Witness Unit can make sure that you are 
notified of important stages of the case to help you exercise your rights. In addition, our Victim/Witness Unit can help

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
United States of America, 
—v—
Ghislaine Maxwell, 
Defendant. 
USDC SDNY 
DOCUMENT 
ELECTRONICALLY PILED 
DOC N: 
DATE FILED: 7/7/2020 
20-CR-330 (MN) 
ORDER 
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
An arraignment, initial conference, and bail hearing in this matter is hereby scheduled to 
occur as a remote video/teleconference using an intemet platform on July 14, 2020 at 1 p.m. In 
advance of the conference, Chambers will email counsel with further information on how to 
access the video conference. 
To optimize the quality of the video feed, only the Court, the Defendant, defense counsel, 
and counsel for the Government will appear by video for the proceeding; all others may access 
the audio of the public proceeding by telephone. Due to the limited capacity of the intemet 
platform system, only one attorney per party may participate by video. Co-counsel, members of 
the press, and the public may access the audio feed of the proceeding by calling a dial-in number, 
which the Court will provide in advance of the proceeding by subsequent order. 
Given the high degree of public interest in this case, a video feed of the remote 
proceeding will be available for viewing in the Jury Assembly Room located at the Daniel 
Patrick Moynihan Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street, New York, NY. Due to social distancing 
requirements, seating will be extremely limited; when capacity is reached no additional persons 
will be admitted. Per the S.D.N.Y. COVID-19 Courthouse Entry Program, anyone who appears 
at any S.D.N.Y. courthouse must complete a questionnaire on the date of the proceeding prior to 
EFTA00024443
--- PAGE 2 ---
arriving at the courthouse. All visitors must also have their temperature taken when they arrive 
at the courthouse. Please see the instructions, attached. Completing the questionnaire ahead of 
time will save time and effort upon entry. Only persons who meet the entry requirements 
established by the questionnaire and whose temperatures are below 100.4 degrees will be 
allowed to enter the courthouse. Face coverings that cover the nose and mouth must be worn at 
all times. Anyone who fails to comply with the COVID-19 protocols that have been adopted by 
the Court will be required to leave the courthouse. There are no exceptions. 
As discussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible, discuss the 
Waiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant prior to the proceeding. 
See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form (either personally or, in 
accordance with Standing Order 20-MC-174 of March 27, 2020, by defense counsel), defense 
counsel shall file the executed form at least 24 hours prior to the proceeding. In the event the 
Defendant consents, but counsel is unable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the 
form, the Court will conduct an inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is 
appropriate for the Court to add the Defendant's signature to the form. 
Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3771(c)(1), the Government must "make their best efforts to see 
that crime victims are notified of, and accorded, the rights" provided to them in that section. 
This includes "Nile right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court 
proceeding ... involving the crime or of any release ... of the accused" and "[t]he right to be 
reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the district court involving release." Id. § 
3771(a)(2), (4). The Court will inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So 
that appropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the Court by 
EFTA00024444
--- PAGE 3 ---
email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim wishes to be heard on 
the question of detention pending trial. 
Finally, the time between the Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2020 is excluded under the 
Speedy Trial Act due to the delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. 
See 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(1)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act 
from today through July 14, 2020. Due to the logistical issues involved in conducting a remote 
proceeding, the Court finds "that the ends of justice served by [this exclusion] outweigh the best 
interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial." 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(7)(A). The 
exclusion is also supported by the need for the parties to discuss a potential protective order, 
which will facilitate the timely production of discovery in a manner protective of the rights of 
third parties. See Dkt. No. 5. 
SO ORDERED.

Hi 
Hope you're doing well. As we continue our review of materials from the prior Florida investigation into Epstein, we've 
realized that the SDFL team assigned what appears to be a unique Jane Doe number (e.g., Jane Doe #1, Jane Doe #2) to 
each of the victims SDFL identified. We have not been able to find a key matching up each Jane Doe number with the 
corresponding victim name. Any chance you would be able to help us track that down, please? In order to figure out 
whether a document refers to one of our witnesses, we need to know the names that go with each Jane Doe number. 
Thanks very much,

On a serious note, don't want to step on any other paralegal's toes, but if you need help with anything with the Ghislane

GHISLAINE MAXWELL CHARGED IN MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURT FOR 
CONSPIRING WITH JEFFREY EPSTEIN TO SEXUALLY ABUSE MINORS 
Maxwell is Alleged to Have Facilita- ted, Participated in Acts of Abuse 
Additionally Charged With Perjwy in Connection With 2016 Depositions 
Audrey Strauss, the Acting United States Attorney- for the Southern District of New York, William F. 
Sweeney Jr., the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation ("FBI"), and Dermot Shea, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department ("NYPD"), 
announced that GHISLANE MAXWELL was arrested this morning and charged with enticing a minor to travel 
to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, 
conspiracy to commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. The Indictment 
unsealed today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 through 1997, MAXWELL and co-conspirator 
Jeffrey Epstein exploited girls as young as 14, including by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the 
purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference for young girls, 
MAXWELL played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations 
including New York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, MAXWELL made several false 
statements in sworn depositions in 2016. MAXWELL is expected to be presented this afternoon in the in federal 
court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan. 
Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated, aided, and 
participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then 
delivered them into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust. 
All the while, she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself. 
Today, after many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the 
most important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the 
law and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth into 
behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the quest for 
justice has been met with great disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. The 
example set by the women involved has been a powerful one. They persevered against the rich and connected, 
and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a subpoena - and they stood together. I have no doubt the bravery 
exhibited by the women involved here has empowered others to speak up about the crimes of which they've been 
subjected." 
NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said: "The heinous crimes these charges allege are, and always will 
be abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement 
partners, for their continuing commitment to bringing justice to the survivors of sexual assault, everywhere." 
If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, please contact 
the FBI at 1-800-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
According to the Indictment[ I I unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated 
in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, 
which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
EFTA00024482
--- PAGE 3 ---
As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies or 
taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at 
ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. 
Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to accept offers of 
financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. MAXWELL also 
normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, encouraging them to massage 
Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and 
susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between 
minor victims and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL 
was present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages 
during which a minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein 
involving a minor victim where MAXWELL was present. 
As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching 
of a victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to 
touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and 
Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as 
well as MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal 
sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to 
travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of 
transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, which carries a maximum sentence of 
years in prison, one count of conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual 
activity, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and two counts of perjury, each of which 
carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
The statutory maximum penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational 
purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be determined by the judge. 
Ms. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and the NYPD. 
This case is being handled b the Office's Public Corruption Unit. Assistant U.S. Attorneys 
and 
are in charge of the prosecution. 
The charges contained in the Indictment are merely accusations. The defendant is presumed innocent 
unless and until proven guilty.

Man, that spelling was not included in my searches. So the answer is that I unfortunately don't currently have an 
independent memory of it. However, reconstructing the communications, it looks like at 4:50 p.m. 
connected us 
with 
SSA of C-19, via email. At 5:15 p.m., 
sent an email to me, 
and 
saying it was nice 
speaking with us and thanking us for offering assistance in the investigation, and copying his agents on the case 
and =). 
Then at 5:59 p.m., I sent an email to those agents copying you as their point person. 
I don't remember whether I actually spoke with the line agents, =, 
or some combination of both, but I think it's most 
likely that we spoke with 
, given 
email at 4:50, 
email to the three of us at 5:15 referring having 
spoken with us, and my email to 
about the info from C-19 at 5:34. The originals of those emails are all attached. 
Let me know if any other info would be useful? And I'm sorry I didn't recall this when we talked on the phone earlier.

We just got word from C-19 that Epstein made a phone call last night to Kristina Schuliak (ph), who is his current / latest 
girlfriend, around 7:00 p.m. The agents contacted her, she said she wanted a lawyer, and the agents have now heard from 
her lawyer who says she'll tell them about the content of the phone call but she wants some kind of protections. It 
sounds like the girlfriend is willing to talk sooner rather than later, so whenever someone is assigned to the new 
investigation, we can put him or her in touch with that agent for whatever follow-up is appropriate.

Hi there, 
Pm a senior journalist for News Corporation (The Sun, NY Post, Wall St Journal) covering the USA V 
Ghislaine Maxwell case. 
I'll be in court for the bail hearing tomorrow but wanted to put a few questions to your team in advance as I 
know Tuesday will be extremely busy for everyone involved. 
- What will the prosecution be arguing in court tomorrow? 
- Will any alleged victims or witnesses be taking the stand on Tuesday? If so, how many (and who are 
they)? What can the court expect to hear from them? 
- Will any prosecutors, victims or witnesses be making a statement to the media outside the court before or 
after the hearing? If so, could you please let me know a time and place if one is scheduled along with any 
other relevant details? 
- Anything to add? 
Would you please also include me in any future emails/alerts etc to the media regarding this case? 
Thank you.

We're not yet exactly sure what our ability is to provide to the Trustees what is effectively discovery in a now-defunct 
criminal case against Epstein himself; that said, I can convey that we did produce to defense counsel detailed search

criminal defense counsel? In particular I believe what you're looking for would be especially at USA0_4381-4445, but 
potentially also USAO_2662-4380 (though I note that a handful of those pages were marked as Confidential under a 
protective order, as set forth in the discovery letter sent to counsel on July 31, 2019). We will also review the status of 
the search warrant return with respect to the island property (and we have not searched the New Mexico property),

Following up on your request for a meeting, I think due to various holiday-related issues we don't yet have a response for 
you, and wanted to provide that status given the approach of the dates you had initially mentioned as being possible. It's 
our hope that once everyone in our office is back and settled next week we'll be able to circle back to you with more

you as soon as possible.

UNITED STATES ATTORNEY'S OFFICE 
Southern District of New York 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL CHARGED IN MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURT FOR 
CONSPIRING WITH JEFFREY EPSTEIN TO SEXUALLY ABUSE MINORS 
Maxwell is Alleged to Have Facilita- ted, Participated in Acts of Abuse 
Additionally Charged With Perjwy in Connection With 2016 Depositions 
Audrey Strauss, the Acting United States Attorney- for the Southern District of New York, William F. 
Sweeney Jr., the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation ("FBI"), and Dermot Shea, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department ("NYPD"), 
announced that GHISLANE MAXWELL was arrested this morning and charged with enticing a minor to travel 
to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, 
conspiracy to commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. The Indictment 
unsealed today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 through 1997, MAXWELL and co-conspirator 
Jeffrey Epstein exploited girls as young as 14, including by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the 
purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference for young girls, 
EFTA00024516
--- PAGE 2 ---
MAXWELL played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations 
including New York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, MAXWELL made several false 
statements in sworn depositions in 2016. MAXWELL is expected to be presented this afternoon in the in federal 
court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan. 
Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated, aided, and 
participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then 
delivered them into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust. 
All the while, she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself. 
Today, after many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the 
most important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the 
law and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth into 
behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the quest for 
justice has been met with great disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. The 
example set by the women involved has been a powerful one. They persevered against the rich and connected, 
and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a subpoena - and they stood together. I have no doubt the bravery 
exhibited by the women involved here has empowered others to speak up about the crimes of which they've been 
subjected." 
NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said: "The heinous crimes these charges allege are, and always will 
be abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement 
partners, for their continuing commitment to bringing justice to the survivors of sexual assault, everywhere." 
If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, please contact 
the FBI at 1-800-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
According to the Indictment[ I I unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated 
in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, 
which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies or 
taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at 
ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. 
Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to accept offers of 
financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. MAXWELL also 
normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, encouraging them to massage 
Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and 
susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between 
minor victims and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL 
was present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages 
during which a minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein 
involving a minor victim where MAXWELL was present.

--- PAGE 3 ---
As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching 
of a victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to 
touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and 
Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as 
well as MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal 
sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to 
travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of 
transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, which carries a maximum sentence of 
years in prison, one count of conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual 
activity, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and two counts of perjury, each of which 
carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
The statutory maximum penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational 
purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be determined by the judge. 
Ms. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and the NYPD. 
This case is being handled by the Office's Public Corruption Unit. Assistant U.S. Attorneys 
and 
are in charge of the prosecution. 
The charges contained in the Indictment are merely accusations. The defendant is presumed innocent 
unless and until proven guilty.

UNITED STATES ATTORNEY'S OFFICE 
Southern District of New York 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL CHARGED IN MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURT FOR 
CONSPIRING WITH JEFFREY EPSTEIN TO SEXUALLY ABUSE MINORS 
Maxwell is Alleged to Have Facilita- ted, Participated in Acts of Abuse 
Additionally Charged With Perjury in Connection With 2016 Depositions 
Audrey Strauss, the Acting United States Attorney- for the Southern District of New York, William F. 
Sweeney Jr., the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation ("FBI"), and Dermot Shea, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department ("NYPD"), 
announced that GHISLANE MAXWELL was arrested this morning and charged with enticing a minor to travel 
to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, 
conspiracy to commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. The Indictment 
unsealed today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 through 1997, MAXWELL and co-conspirator 
Jeffrey Epstein exploited girls as young as 14, including by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the 
EFTA00024519
--- PAGE 2 ---
purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference for young girls, 
MAXWELL played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations 
including New York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, MAXWELL made several false 
statements in sworn depositions in 2016. MAXWELL is expected to be presented this afternoon in the in federal 
court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan. 
Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated, aided, and 
participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then 
delivered them into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust. 
All the while, she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself. 
Today, after many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the 
most important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the 
law and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth into 
behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the quest for 
justice has been met with great disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. The 
example set by the women involved has been a powerful one. They persevered against the rich and connected, 
and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a subpoena - and they stood together. I have no doubt the bravery 
exhibited by the women involved here has empowered others to speak up about the crimes of which they've been 
subjected." 
NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said: "The heinous crimes these charges allege are, and always will 
be abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement 
partners, for their continuing commitment to bringing justice to the survivors of sexual assault, everywhere." 
If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, please contact 
the FBI at 1-800-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
According to the Indictment[ 11 unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated 
in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, 
which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies or 
taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated

Robert, 
Wanted to quickly follow up on our conversation from a couple weeks ago — obviously it was before the world 
imploded, so understand if you haven't gotten a chance to connect on this yet, but we were wondering about the 
Lion King question? Just to briefly remind, the Lion King musical first came out in 1997, which we think would have 
been well after 
first trip to New York (based on her recollection as well as the flight records), while the movie 
came out in 1994 and was in theaters through approximately spring 1995. So entirely possible she was referencing 
the movie version, or that going to the play wasn't the first visit, or just doesn't have a specific memory, etc etc, but 
wanted to check for our records and our decision-making process. 
Thank you! And hope you and your family are healthy and safe in the midst of everything going on. 
thanks again, 
Assistant U.S. Attorney 
Southern District of New York

("FBP"), and Dermot Shea, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department ("NYPD"), announced that 
GHISLANE MAXWELL was arrested this morning and charged with enticing a minor to travel to engage in 
criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, conspiracy to 
commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. The Indictment unsealed 
today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 through 1997, MAXWELL and co-conspirator Jeffrey 
Epstein exploited girls as young as 14, including by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the 
purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference for young girls, 
MAXWELL played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations 
including New York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, MAXWELL made several false 
statements in sworn depositions in 2016. MAXWELL is expected to be presented this afternoon in the in 
federal court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan. 
Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated, aided, and participated 
EFTA00024531
--- PAGE 2 ---
in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then delivered them 
into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust. All the while, 
she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself. Today, after 
many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the most 
important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the law 
and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth into 
behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the quest 
for justice has been met with great disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. 
The example set by the women involved has been a powerful one. They persevered against the rich and 
connected, and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a subpoena - and they stood together. I have no doubt the 
bravery exhibited by the women involved here has empowered others to speak up about the crimes of which 
they've been subjected." 
NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said: "The heinous crimes these charges allege are, and always will be 
abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement 
partners, for their continuing commitment to bringing justice to the survivors of sexual assault, everywhere." 
If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, please contact the FBI at I-
800-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
According to the Indictment[1] unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated in 
Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, 
which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies 
or taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at 
ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's 
behavior. Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to 
accept offers of financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. 
MAXWELL also normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, 
encouraging them to massage Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and susceptible 
to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between minor victims 
and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL was present 
for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages during which a 
minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein involving a minor 
victim where MAXWELL was present. 
As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching of a 
victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to touch 
Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and Epstein's 
victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as well as 
MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made false 
statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex 
acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to 
EFTA00024532

carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
The statutory maximum penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational 
purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be determined by the judge.

UNITED STATES ATTORNEY'S OFFICE 
Southern District of New York 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL CHARGED IN MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURT FOR 
CONSPIRING WITH JEFFREY EPSTEIN TO SEXUALLY ABUSE MINORS 
Maxwell is Alleged to Have Facilita- ted, Participated in Acts of Abuse 
Additionally Charged With Perjury in Connection With 2016 Depositions 
Audrey Strauss, the Acting United States Attorney- for the Southern District of New York, William F. 
Sweeney Jr., the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation ("FBI"), and Dermot Shea, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department ("NYPD"), 
announced that GHISLANE MAXWELL was arrested this morning and charged with enticing a minor to travel 
to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, 
conspiracy to commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. The Indictment 
unsealed today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 through 1997, MAXWELL and co-conspirator 
Jeffrey Epstein exploited girls as young as 14, including by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the 
purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference for young girls, 
MAXWELL played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations 
including New York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, MAXWELL made several false 
statements in sworn depositions in 2016. MAXWELL is expected to be presented this afternoon in the in federal 
court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan.

Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated, aided, and 
participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then 
delivered them into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust. 
All the while, she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself. 
Today, after many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the 
most important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the 
law and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth into 
behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the quest for 
justice has been met with great disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. The 
example set by the women involved has been a powerful one. They persevered against the rich and connected, 
and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a subpoena - and they stood together. I have no doubt the bravery 
exhibited by the women involved here has empowered others to speak up about the crimes of which they've been 
subjected." 
NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said: "The heinous crimes these charges allege are, and always will 
be abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement 
partners, for their continuing commitment to bringing justice to the survivors of sexual assault, everywhere." 
If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, please contact 
the FBI at 1400-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
According to the Indictment[ I I unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated 
in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, 
which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies or 
taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at 
ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. 
Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to accept offers of 
financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. MAXWELL also 
normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, encouraging them to massage 
Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and 
susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between 
minor victims and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL 
was present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages 
during which a minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein 
involving a minor victim where MAXWELL was present. 
As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching 
of a victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to 
touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and 
EFTA00024548
--- PAGE 3 ---
Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as 
well as MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal 
sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to 
travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of 
transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, which carries a maximum sentence of 
years in prison, one count of conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual 
activity, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and two counts of perjury, each of which 
carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
The statutory maximum penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational 
purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be determined by the judge. 
Ms. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and the NYPD. 
This case is being handled by the Office's Public Corruption Unit. Assistant U.S. Attorneys 
and 
are in charge of the prosecution. 
The charges contained in the Indictment are merely accusations. The defendant is presumed innocent 
unless and until proven guilty.

NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said: "The heinous crimes these charges allege are, 
and always will be abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on victims. I commend our

If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, 
please contact the FBI at 1-800-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
According to the Indictment' unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, 
and participated in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey 
Epstein to recruit, groom, and ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be 
under the age of 18. The victims were as young as 14 years old when they were groomed and 
abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew that their victims were in fact minors. 
As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, MAXWELL and Epstein 
enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, which 
MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual 
abuse. 
As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. 
For example, MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, 
taking them to the movies or taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions 
with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present 
for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at ease by providing the assurance and 
comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. Additionally, to 
make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to accept offers of 
financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. 
As the introductory phrase signifies, the entirety of the text of the Indictment, and the description of the Indictment 
set forth herein, constitute only allegations, and every fact described therein should be treated as an allegation. The 
defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty. 
EFTA00024557
--- PAGE 3 ---
MAXWELL also normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with 
victims, encouraging them to massage Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims 
vulnerable and susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain 
sexual encounters between minor victims and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim 
was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL was present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on 
minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages during which a minor victim was fully 
or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein involving a minor victim 
where MAXWELL was present. 
As alleged, minor victims were sub'ected to sexual abuse that included, amon: other 
Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as well as MAXWELL's residence 
in London, England. 
Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL 
repeatedly made false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the 
Indictment. 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to 
engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count 
of conspiracy to entice a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum 
sentence of five years in prison, one count of transporting a minor with the intent to engage in 
criminal sexual activity, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, one count of 
conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, which 
carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and two counts of perjury, each of which 
carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
The statutory maximum penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for 
informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be determined by the 
judge. 
Ms. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and the NYPD. 
This case is bein handled b the Office's Public Corruption Unit. Assistant U.S. 
Attorneys 
and 
are in charge of the prosecution. 
The charges contained in the Indictment are merely accusations. The defendant is 
presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

SEXUALLY ABUSE MINORS 
UNITED STATES ATTORNEY'S OFFICE 
Southern District of New York 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL CHARGED IN MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURT FOR 
CONSPIRING WITH JEFFREY EPSTEIN TO SEXUALLY ABUSE MINORS 
Maxwell is Alleged to Have Facilita- ted, Participated in Acts of Abuse 
Additionally Charged With Perjury in Connection With 2016 Depositions 
Audrey Strauss, the Acting United States Attorney- for the Southern District of New York, William F. 
Sweeney Jr., the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation ("FBI"), and Dermot Shea, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department ("NYPD"), 
announced that GHISLANE MAXWELL was arrested this morning and charged with enticing a minor to travel 
to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, 
conspiracy to commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. The Indictment 
unsealed today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 through 1997, MAXWELL and co-conspirator 
Jeffrey Epstein exploited girls as young as 14, including by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the 
purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference for young girls, 
MAXWELL played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations 
including New York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, MAXWELL made several false 
statements in sworn depositions in 2016. MAXWELL is expected to be presented this afternoon in the in federal 
court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan. 
Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated, aided, and 
participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then 
delivered them into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust. 
EFTA00024559
--- PAGE 2 ---
All the while, she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself. 
Today, after many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the 
most important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the 
law and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth into 
behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the quest for 
justice has been met with great disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. The 
example set by the women involved has been a powerful one. They persevered against the rich and connected, 
and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a subpoena - and they stood together. I have no doubt the bravery 
exhibited by the women involved here has empowered others to speak up about the crimes of which they've been 
subjected." 
NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said: "The heinous crimes these charges allege are, and always will 
be abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement 
partners, for their continuing commitment to bringing justice to the survivors of sexual assault, everywhere."

touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and

well as MAXWELL's residence in London, England.

Exactly — I think that was the number we had at the time we asked for the estimate, which was then slightly revised 
(we've gotten different info from the FBI over time). But very easy to update with Tom and I'm sure it wouldn't change 
the estimate significantly.

Just to confirm, this estimate is for everything from both SWs, right? It looks like the attached email contemplates 57 
devices, and it sounds like we're just over 60 at this point, but I assume that's an issue we could resolve with Tom pretty 
easily if need be?

Following up on the below, I think we've given this our absolute best efforts with FBI — they are now well over a month 
later than their estimate from April on when we would get the New York materials, they're also past their estimate of 
getting us the New York materials from just this Monday, and we don't have anything close to an estimate on the USVI 
materials, which constitute the overwhelming majority of the data and are vastly more voluminous than the New York 
devices. We have kept pushing the timeline back for this option, hoping that CART will finalize, but I think at this point we 
should have a vendor do it. 
Attached is an estimate we got from BRG, which would get everything to us in under a month, and in Relativity-friendly 
format, in a range of $85-135K. BRG has done this for our office multiple times in the past and are very effective and 
efficient, and they get the materials we need. And most importantly, they estimate they can do it all in less than a 
month. May we have approval to seek funding for this? The estimate is attached. Thanks very much.

You are getting both NY and USVI. The biggest stumbling block are the newer Mac items that are in APFS

I am in the process of exporting the materials (documents, spreadsheets, emails, etc) for your review as per my 
discussions with 
. Most of the NY stuff is done, just Mac items left. This might take a few days as 1 item in 
particular has over 500,000 emails. We will be able to provide discovery once Defense Council has provided 
drives for us to copy items over to. This goes quicker as there is no processing involved. I'll let you know when 
everything is complete.

Also, the related critical question that I don't think we have clarity on is whether you're giving us a copy of everything that

figured out a way to categorize the prior productions so they're useful for us? We would strongly prefer to just

Wanted to circle back on this and check in, particularly because we desperately need to get the results from the July and

Unfortunately, recent events and our staffing levels have conspired to put a kink in just about everything. If we 
can't make heads or tails of the stuff I've already produced, we'll do it again. They have told us that our staffing 
levels will be steadily increasing over the next few weeks, but I'm going to have to push back my estimate by a

Separately, to follow up on a question from the May 15 email below, the list has just five devices as still pending to be

so if we're able to match them up by Bates number now, that might work, but otherwise I think it makes sense for us to

gotten any updates on that status in the past few weeks, and we're eager to be able to start reviewing.

Updated item descriptions. Just a side note, many thumb drives and SD cards will not have a serial number 
visible externally, but will report one through our tools. I included those electronically reported serial numbers. 
Any questions, let me know.

Thanks for this, it's a helpful start. In terms of being able to write our search warrant, one additional piece of information 
we need is the serial number, or some other specific identifier, ideally for each device but at least for any device that there 
is more than one of the same thing. So for example, we need to be able to somehow differentiate the following devices — 
The two Dell power edge T310 hard drives (NYCO24323 and NYCO24324) 
The two Sony Vaio laptop / Fujitsu hdd (NYCO24336 and NYCO24337) 
the following loose storage devices: 
o Micro SD card (NYCO24339) 
o Flash Drive (generic) (NYCO24340) 
o Thumbdrive (Emtec) (NYCO24341) 
o hard drive (loose) (NYCO24342) 
o verbatim thumbdrive (NYCO24343) 
The four San Disk cruzer-thumbdrives (NYCO24344-47) 
The three Seagate IDE hard drives (NYCO24348-50) 
The camera SD card (NYCO24351) 
I think the rest of the devices are either specifically distinguishable and/or have an S/N listed. (By comparison, the USVI 
spreadsheet we have lists an s/n for about 20 of the 25(ish) devices. 
The other thing we're looking for is the location in the house (and ideally specific location) for each device, which the USVI 
list also has — is that info available? 
The list also has just five devices as still pending to be transferred to us, and I think it's right that the plan is to reproduce 
all the materials so that we can get them in searchable format, but just wanted to confirm? Currently, we aren't able to 
match any of the prior productions to specific devices — so if we're able to match them up by Bates number now, that 
might work, but otherwise I think it makes sense for us to get everything. But let us know if any issue with that. 
thanks very much,

Here is The listing of all the evidence gathered in NY that I have. I added some columns to guide you to the 
unique numbers CART NY uses fro their evidence. The template wasn't a slam dunk over, so I did what I could to 
convey the information. If you are confused by anything, please let me know. In the column for approximate 
size, it is in GB, totaled at the bottom and converted to TB. In the materials contained column, I put what load 
file group the data was transferred over in (Mac, Windows, Loose Media, IDE, or Blacklight) If there is no entry 
in that column, that data has yet to be transferred. There are 2 Macs and a DVR you don't have as well as an 
iPhone and an iPad. IF the descriptions are a bit light, let me know and I'll do what I can to beef them up. I will 
get you the Island stuff tomorrow.

Respectfully, I think there are some miscommunications here — all we have asked is to receive the materials in a format 
such that we can view them using a system we have access to. We're not able to get web-enabled access through any FBI 
tool, so we asked for the materials to be transferred in a loadable format so we could put them on Relativity, which both 
we and the agents can access. We're required to have the files in a format that we can produce them to defense counsel. 
I've done that in many other cases and it hasn't previously been an issue. My understanding from 
is that the best 
way to do it now is just for us (the U.S. Attorney's Office) to get the original files, which our vendor will process—by which 
I just mean converting into file formats that are loadable onto Relativity. It doesn't really have anything to do with the 
taint review—we have to have access to the docs in our systems for discovery purposes. 
And we were happy to get the materials as they were processed, but when we received the 1.1 million documents earlier 
this year, they were in a format that wasn't usable for the reasons described in the email I sent on March 9. Again, I 
understand from 
that the best way forward is to just get copies of the materials in their original formats, which I 
understand will be segregated and designated by device. That should work for us! I was just trying to understand the 
approach, as well as the timeline. 
thanks,

Subject: Re: Epstein search warrant documents 
Just to be clear. The US Attorney's Office (or it's contractors) are not "processing" anything. You are taking files 
that I will be extracting from processed evidence and putting them into an E-Discovery tool (Relativity) to do a 
taint review. 
Relativity is NOT a forensic tool. It is incapable of dealing with many things that are found forensically on a 
computer like free space, slack space, and system files to name a few. When we started this, and you insisted 
you do the taint review in Relativity, I warned you that it was adding months worth of work on top of what was 
already done, and that Relativity was incapable of viewing everything. You insisted we do it this way. So now 
and I have come up with a way to fit this round peg into this square hole. We will get it done. 
Sorry it has taken so long, but we are talking about terabytes worth of data over multiple forms of digital 
evidence. Phones, tablets, loose media, cameras, DVRs, servers, laptops, and desktop computers. We have 
gotten past encryption on multiple devices. When we review devices on such large cases, we usually do it piece 
by piece as things are processed, I was unaware that you didn't want to review as things were processed, that 
you wanted to do it "all at once", so that added to the delay. Sorry for that. Just a differentiation of 
methodology I suppose. 
and I feel confident that the method we have come up with will be more consistent and preserve the 
attribution of files to devices and links of e-mails to attachments that the load file generation that I did a while 
back was lacking.

Okay, so just to check, you both think that there is not a need to do a test run? You're both comfortable with just basically 
sending us copies of everything? I don't totally understand why we couldn't have done that eight months ago, but 
regardless of the passage of time, I want to make sure we understand so we can report to our supervisors. I assume that 
means that we (at the U.S. Attorney's Office and through contractors) will therefore need to do all the processing 
ourselves, correct? And thanks again to you both.

Unfortunately I don't think this is very helpful to us. Did you take a look at the example spreadsheet I sent on 2/24? The 
excel file you sent has descriptions that don't match up to the items listed in the search warrant returns (that we sent on 
EFTA00024578
--- PAGE 14 ---
2/23), and we don't have the 1B or CART numbers to be able to cross-reference. We also can't tell what you mean by 
"loose media" without a specific comparison to what was seized, we don't know which items you're referring to as 
"Windows machines," and we can't tell whether the entirety of any particular item has been transferred, or just partial. 
For example, it looks like we have gotten very, very few image files, which is surprising. 
We have also encountered some very significant problems in trying to review the more than 1 million documents we 
recently received: 
The data we've received has no way to put any emails and attachments together. So if an email says, "see the 
attached flight records," for example, we have no way of linking that up with the records themselves. Not only is 
that a big problem for us in review, it's going to be a huge problem for producing the documents to defense 
counsel. 
The load file has no link to the native file, so when we load the data to the database, there's no way to have the 
native files show up in the database. Because many of the files are too large to open in the viewer, it effectively 
means that there are many files that are completely invisible to us. 
Related, the control numbers in the load file don't match up to the native files. So we have two sets of numbers 
and no way to match up anything—that is, even if we were to try to go hunt down every individual large file in the 
native files, it would be impossible. 
So the data that we most recently got, we need to get in a form that addresses those issues, and we likely will need to get 
a similar reproduction of the data we received a couple months ago. Otherwise we're sifting through more than a million 
documents without much rhyme or reason. 
I've re-attached the spreadsheet we sent last week — I think that's a good place to start in terms of our necessary record-
keeping, and we need that info at the very least, as well as anything else you think would be useful. Also attaching the SW 
returns for reference. And again, we're happy to meet up anytime and hash all this out in person if that's useful.

Here is a listing of what I have already handed over in load files to the US Attorney's Office for taint review. Some points of 
clarification: There were 9 IDE hard drives found in the Manhattan apartment, they turned out to be 3 copies of 3 drives 
(9 drives in total) from a July 2007 search on one of his properties. I only processed 3 (as they were all copies). All the 
loose media from the NY apartment is included. All the Windows machines from the NY apartment are included. Only 2 
Macs from NY and 1 from the Island are included. 
I will have to more closely coordinate with whoever is loading up Relativity with the remaining Macs as the tool 
they have to be processed with does not easily re-name the load files. 
Spreadsheet is attached.

what I think would be most helpful to facilitate that would be a spreadsheet of each separate device referenced in the two 
search warrant returns, with columns for whether we've dumped the contents, whether they've been reviewed and/or 
transferred, what portions were transferred, etc. 
Something roughly like the attached, with any other categories you think would be useful — and the info on the attached is 
mostly hypothetical, obviously, just as examples. That will help us fully understand what's been reviewed, transferred, 
and received so far, and what remains. 
(Also just on the pictures, we do want copies of those as well, please including from the discs and the devices — I think FBI 
was going to do an initial screen to make sure no CP, and since I think the answer was no, we'll need to get those to be 
able to review them as well.)

Sony for the delayed response. They are tearing out our old network and giving us a new one, they mandated we 
delete old stuff (about 400 TB worth). Now that they are working on replacing the network, we can do only local 
work. I should be able to give you an accounting of what is what. I can say, off the top of my head, that all 
windows based items from the NY search have been handed over as well as all loose media. The CDs from NY 
only contained pictures, no documents. There are still some Apple items from NY that need to be produced. As

Based on the attached search warrant returns, it looks like from the New York mansion (the PDF) there are approximately 
devices that would have storage (computers, hard drives, thumb drives, etc.) and that's not even counting at least 60+

I'm not sure who's the exact right person to ask this, so wanted to get everybody on one email chain about it — I have the 
hard drive that 
dropped off that has new Epstein search warrant materials, but it looks like there are also old 
materials (that I think we had previously received and uploaded??) on the hard drive, and so I'm not sure what's new. 
Just generally, and 
and I talked about this last week too, but it's basically impossible for us to keep track of what 
we're getting, and what has been completed, without some kind of identification or labeling system, along with a list of 
which devices have been extracted and downloaded. 
So for example on the hard drive currently, there are 38 folders labeled "loadFiles" through "37loadFiles" with a modified 
date of 11/14/19, which I think we may have already previously received — but I'm not sure, because we haven't gotten 
any info on which folders match up to which devices, etc. And then there's another folder titled "NYC024362" that has a 
modified date of 1/27/20, so I think that may be the materials we hadn't previously received? That folder by itself has 
more than 600,000 items. 
I don't want to give 
anything that we've already previously received and uploaded, and I can't tell from the folder or 
file names whether everything on the drive is new, or whether just additional materials were saved onto it in addition to 
what we already have. =, 
are you able to give us some guidance on this? Ultimately what we really need is a 
spreadsheet of every device, whether it's been dumped (or partially dumped), and then identifying that same info —
which device, and what materials from it — are being given to us with each data transfer. Otherwise I think 
organizationally and for review purposes it will be a total disaster for us. 
We're happy to have a meeting on this if that's helpful — and thanks everybody for the assistance.

Re: 
United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 (RMB) 
Dear Judge Pitman: 
The Government respectfully submits this letter in advance of the bail hearing scheduled 
for July 8, 2019, in the above-captioned case. For the reasons set forth herein, the Court should 
order that the defendant be detained pending trial; he cannot meet his burden of overcoming the 
presumption that there is no combination of conditions that would reasonably assure his continued 
appearance in this case or protect the safety of the community were he to be released. 
As set forth below, the charges in this case are exceptionally serious: the defendant is 
alleged to be a serial sexual predator who preyed on dozens of minor girls over a period of years, 
and he now faces a potentially massive prison sentence predicated on substantial and multifaceted 
evidence of his guilt. In light of the strength of the Government's evidence and the substantial 
incarceratory term the defendant would face upon conviction, there is an extraordinary risk of 
flight, particularly given the defendant's exorbitant wealth, his ownership of and access to private 
planes capable of international travel, and his significant international ties. Indeed, the arrest of 
the defendant occurred when he arrived in the United States on his private jet after having returned 
from a multi-week stay abroad. 
Finally, and as detailed herein, the Government has real concerns—grounded in past 
experience with this defendant—that if allowed to remain out on bail, the defendant could attempt 
to pressure and intimidate witnesses and potential witnesses in this case, including victims and 
their families, and otherwise attempt to obstruct justice. As a result, he poses both an acute danger 
to the community, including some of its most vulnerable members, and a significant risk of flight. 
The defendant thus cannot overcome the statutory presumption that detention is appropriate in this 
case, and the Court should order that he be detained pending trial.

BACKGROUND 
A. Overview 
On July 2, 2019, a federal grand jury in the Southern District of New York returned a sealed 
indictment (the "Indictment") charging the defendant with one count of sex trafficking of minors, 
in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591, and one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors, 
in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371. 
As charged by the grand jury, the facts underlying the charges in the Indictment arise from 
a years-long scheme to sexually abuse underage girls. In particular, beginning in at least 2002, the 
defendant enticed and recruited dozens of minor girls to engage in sex acts with him, for which he 
paid the victims hundreds of dollars in cash. 
He undertook this activity in at least two different locations, including his mansion in 
Manhattan, New York (the "New York Residence") and his estate in Palm Beach, Florida (the 
"Palm Beach Residence"). In both New York and Florida, the defendant perpetuated this abuse in 
similar ways. Victims were initially recruited to provide "massages" to the defendant, which 
would be performed nude or partially nude, would become increasingly sexual in nature, and 
would typically include one or more sex acts, including groping and direct or indirect contact with 
victims' genitals. The defendant paid his victims hundreds of dollars in cash for each separate 
encounter. 
Moreover, the defendant actively encouraged certain of his victims to recruit additional 
girls to be similarly sexually abused. He incentivized his victims to become recruiters by paying 
these victim-recruiters hundreds of dollars for each additional girl they brought to him. In this 
fashion, the defendant created a vast network of underage victims for him to exploit, in locations 
including New York and Palm Beach. 
The defendant's victims were as young as 14 years old when he abused them. Many of his 
victims were, for various reasons, often particularly vulnerable to exploitation. The defendant 
intentionally sought out—and knew that he was abusing—minors. Indeed, in some instances, his 
victims expressly told him they were underage before or during the period in which he abused 
them. 
In creating and maintaining a network of minor victims whom he abused, the defendant 
worked with others, including employees and associates who facilitated his exploitation of minors 
by, among other things, contacting victims and scheduling their sexual encounters with the 
defendant, both in New York and in Florida. 
B. The Defendant 
Jeffrey Epstein designed, financed, and perpetrated this scheme, both as its main participant 
and through his direction of others, including certain of his employees, to further facilitate his 
rampant abuse of underage girls.

As has been widely reported, the defendant is extraordinarily wealthy, and he owns and 
maintains luxury properties and residences around the world, including in Manhattan, New York; 
Palm Beach, Florida; Stanley, New Mexico; and Paris, France. Additionally, Epstein owns a 
private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands which, as noted above, is believed to be his primary 
residence in the United States. His mansion in Manhattan alone—a multi-story townhouse 
reported to be one of the largest single residences in all of Manhattan, which previously housed a 
school and which he owns through an LLC—has been valued at approximately $77 million. 
Entities controlled by the defendant also own at least two private jets in active service, at least one 
of which is capable of intercontinental travel. 
As described further below, the defendant possesses three active United States passports, 
and his international connections and travels are extensive. 
For example, in addition to 
maintaining a residence in Paris, France, as described above, in the past 18 months alone, the 
defendant has traveled abroad, via private jet, either into or out of the country on approximately 
more than 20 occasions. 
C. The Prior Florida Investigation 
In or about 2005, the defendant was investigated by local police in Palm Beach, Florida, in 
connection with allegations that he had committed similar sex offenses against minor girls. The 
investigation ultimately also involved federal authorities, namely the U.S. Attorney's Office for 
the Southern District of Florida ("SDFL") and the FBI's Miami Office, and included interviews 
with victims based in the Palm Beach area, including some of the alleged victims relevant to Count 
One of the instant Indictment.' 
In fall 2007, the defendant entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the SDFL in 
connection with the conduct at issue in that investigation, which the non-prosecution agreement 
identified as including investigations into the defendant's abuse of minor girls in the Palm Beach 
area. The Southern District of New York was not a signatory to that agreement, and the defendant 
was never charged federally.' In June 2008, the defendant pled guilty in state court to one count 
of procuring a person under the age of 18 for prostitution, a felony, and one count of solicitation 
of prostitution, a felony. As a result, the defendant was designated as a sex offender with 
registration requirements under the national Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act. 
The non-prosecution agreement, further discussed below, was entered into at the conclusion of 
the SDFL investigation and did not purport to cover any victims outside of the State of Florida. 
As noted above, the instant Indictment expressly alleges the existence of dozens of victims who 
were abused in this District in addition to dozens of victims who were abused in Florida. 
While beyond the scope of a bail hearing, as discussed further below, it is well-established in the 
Second Circuit that absent an express provision to the contrary in the agreement, one District is 
not bound by the terms of an agreement entered into between a defendant and a U.S. Attorney's 
Office in another district. See page 6, infra.

ARGUMENT 
I. 
Applicable Law 
Under the Bail Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. §§ 3141 et seq., federal courts are empowered to 
order a defendant's detention pending trial upon a determination that the defendant is either a 
danger to the community or a risk of flight. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e) ("no condition or combination of 
conditions would reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any 
other person and the community"). 
A finding of risk of flight must be supported by a 
preponderance of the evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 5 (2d Cir. 1987); 
United States v. Chirnurenga, 760 F.2d 400, 405 (2d Cir. 1985). A finding of dangerousness must 
be supported by clear and convincing evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Ferranti, 66 F.3d 540, 
542 (2d Cir. 1995); Chirnurenga, 760 F.2d at 405. In addition, a court may also order detention if 
there is "a serious risk that the [defendant] will . . . attempt to obstruct justice, or . . . to threaten, 
injure, or intimidate, a prospective witness or juror." 18 U.S.C. § 3142(0(2)(B); see also United 
States v. Friedman, 837 F.2d 48 (2d Cir. 1988). 
The Bail Reform Act lists four factors to be considered in the detention analysis: (1) the 
nature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person; 
(3) the history and characteristics of the defendant, including the person's "character . . . [and] 
financial resources"; and (4) the seriousness of the danger posed by the defendant's release. See 
U.S.C. § 3142(g). Evidentiary rules do not apply at detention hearings and the government is 
entitled to present evidence by way of proffer, among other means. See 18 U.S.C. § 3142(0(2); 
see also United States v. LaFontaine, 210 F.3d 125, 130-31 (2d Cir. 2000) (government entitled 
to proceed by proffer in detention hearings); Ferranti, 66 F.3d at 542 (same); United States v. 
Martir, 782 F.2d 1141, 1145 (2d Cir. 1986) (same). 
Where a judicial officer concludes after a hearing that "no condition or combination of 
conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any 
other person and the community, such judicial officer shall order the detention of the person before 
trial." 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(1). Additionally, where, as here, a defendant is charged with 
committing an offense involving a minor victim under 18 U.S.C. § 1591, it shall be presumed, 
subject to rebuttal, that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the 
appearance of the defendant as required and the safety of the community. 
U.S.C. 
§ 3142(e)(3)(E). 
Il. 
Discussion 
The defendant should be detained pending trial. For the reasons set forth below, it is 
difficult to overstate the risk of flight and danger to the community if the defendant is released, 
and for those reasons, the defendant cannot overcome the statutory presumption in favor of 
detention in this case.

A. The Defendant Poses an Extreme Flight Risk 
Each of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk — the nature and circumstances 
of the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant —
counsel strongly in favor of detention. 
I. The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense and the Strength of the Evidence 
The "nature and circumstances" of this offense plainly favor detention. 18 U.S.C. 
§ 3I42(g)( I ) (specifically enumerating "whether the offense. . . involves a minor victim" as a 
factor in bail applications). Indeed, the crime of sex trafficking of a minor is so serious that for a 
defendant charged with that offense, there is a presumption that no condition or combination of 
conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as required and the safety of the 
community. 18 U.S.C. § 3142 (e)(3)(E). Here, as specified in the Indictment, the defendant's 
conduct was committed serially, over a period of years, and affected dozens of victims. 
The seriousness of the charge is also reflected in the penalties the defendant faces, which 
include up to 45 years of incarceration for Counts One and Two of the Indictment.' As the Second 
Circuit has noted, the possibility of a severe sentence is a significant factor in assessing the risk of 
flight. See Jackson, 823 F.2d at 7; see also United States v. Cisneros, 328 F.3d 610, 618 (10th Cir. 
2003) (defendant was a flight risk because her knowledge of the seriousness of the charges against her 
gave her a strong incentive to abscond); United States v. Townsend, 897 F.2d 989, 995 (9th Cir. 1990) 
("Facing the much graver penalties possible under the present indictment, the defendants have an even 
greater incentive to consider flight."). Here, the defendant is facing a statutory maximum of decades 
in prison. Even in the absence of means—which, as discussed in detail below, the defendant has 
in abundance—this fact alone would provide a compelling incentive for anyone to fail to appear. 
It is particularly compelling for a defendant who is 66 years old and therefore faces the very real 
prospect of spending the rest of his life in prison if convicted. 
The likelihood of a substantial period of incarceration is buttressed by the strength of the 
evidence. As set forth in the Indictment, the evidence in this case is strong. The Indictment alleges 
that the defendant sexually abused dozens of minor victims, and the conspiracy count lists 
numerous overt acts committed in furtherance of the defendant's crimes.' 
The current penalties for violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1591 include a 10 year mandatory minimum 
sentence. However, that punishment was created through an amendment to the statute in 2006. 
The penalty for a violation of Section 1591 during the period charged in the Indictment, and 
therefore relevant here, was a maximum of 40 years' imprisonment. 
With respect to the evidence in this case, the Court should start its analysis by accepting that the 
Indictment is sufficient, on its own, to establish probable cause that the defendant committed the 
crimes of sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy. Contreras, 776 F.2d at 54. ("Were an 
evidentiary hearing addressing the existence of probable cause required in every § 3142(e) case in 
which an indictment had been filed, the court would spend scarce judicial resources considering 
that which a grand jury had already determined, and have less time to focus on the application of 
EFTA00024588
--- PAGE 6 ---
Honorable Henry Pitman 
United States Magistrate Judge 
July 8, 2019 
Page 6 
Multiple victims, including several specified in the Indictment, have provided information 
against the defendant. That information is detailed, credible, and corroborated, in many instances, 
by other witnesses and contemporaneous documents, records and other evidence—including, as 
further detailed below, evidence from a search of the New York Residence on the night of the 
defendant's arrest that reflects an extraordinary volume of photographs of nude and partially-nude 
young women or girls. Such corroborating evidence also includes documents and other materials, 
such as contemporaneous notes, messages recovered from the defendant's residence that include 
names and contact information for certain victims, and call records that confirm the defendant and 
his agents were repeatedly in contact with various victims during the charged period. Put simply, 
all of this evidence — the voluminous and credible testimony of individuals who were sexually 
abused by the defendant as minors, each of whom are backed up by other evidence — will be 
devastating evidence of guilt at any trial in this case and weighs heavily in favor of detention. 
Finally, it bears noting that neither the age of the conduct nor the defendant's previous non-
prosecution agreement ("NPA") with a different federal district pose any impediment to his 
conviction. As an initial matter, all of the conduct is timely charged, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3283, 
which was amended in 2003 to extend the limitations period for conduct that was timely as of the 
date of the amendment, to any time during the lifetime of the minor victim. See United States v. 
Chief 438 F.3d 920, 922-25 (9th Cir. 2006) (finding that because Congress extended the statute 
of limitations for sex offenses involving minors during the time the previous statute was still 
running, the extension was permissible); United States v. Pierre-Louis, No. 16 Cr. 541 (CM), 2018 
WL 4043140, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2018) (same). 
Moreover, with respect to the NPA, that agreement, to which the Southern District of New 
York was not a party, which by its express language pertained exclusively to the SDFL 
investigation, and which did not purport to bind any other Office or District, does not preclude 
prosecution in this District for at least two reasons. First, it is well settled in the Second Circuit 
that "a plea agreement in one U.S. Attorney's office does not, unless otherwise stated, bind 
another." United States v. Frisco, 391 F. App'x 920, 921 (2d Cir. 2010) ("A plea agreement binds 
only the office of the United States Attorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it 
affirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.") (citing United States 
v. Annabi, 771 F.2d 670, 672 (2d Cir. 1985) (per curiam)). This is true even if the text of the 
agreement purports to bind "the Government." See Annabi, 771 F.2d at 672. This analysis 
similarly extends to a non-prosecution agreement. See United States v. Laskow, 688 F. Supp. 851, 
854 (E.D.N.Y. 1988) ("Defendant's argument, in effect, is that unless there is an explicit statement 
to the contrary, it is presumed that a non-prosecution agreement binds offices of the United States 
Attorney that are not parties to the agreement. This position is at odds with the law in this Circuit, 
which presumes a narrow reading of the boundaries of a plea agreement unless a defendant can 
affirmatively establish that a more expansive interpretation was contemplated.") (citing Annabi, 
771 F.2d at 672). Second, the Indictment charges conduct not covered by the NPA, namely 
the presumptions and the § 3142(g) factors in deciding whether the defendant should be 
detained."). 
EFTA00024589
--- PAGE 7 ---

United States Magistrate Judge

Page 7 
conduct that occurred in New York. The prior NPA included a list of several dozen victims 
identified in the prior investigation, all of whom were abused in the State of Florida, and none of 
whom are a part of the conduct charged in Count Two of the instant Indictment. 
Each of these factors—the seriousness of the allegations, the strength of the evidence, and 
the possibility of lengthy incarceration—creates an extraordinary incentive to flee. And as further 
described below, the defendant has the means and money to do so. 
2. The Characteristics of the Defendant 
The history and characteristics of the defendant also strongly support detention. The 
defendant is extraordinarily wealthy and has access to vast financial resources to fund any attempt 
to flee. Indeed, his potential avenues of flight from justice are practically limitless. 
As the defendant acknowledged in his most recent New York State sex offender 
registration, he has six residences, including two in the U.S. Virgin Islands (including his own 
private island), and one each in Palm Beach, Florida; Paris, France; New York, New York; and 
Stanley, New Mexico. The most recent estimated value of the defendant's New York City mansion 
alone is more than $77 million. The most recent tax-assessed value of the defendant's Palm Beach 
estate is more than $12 million. The defendant's primary residence is a private island in the U.S. 
Virgin Islands, a place where any sort of meaningful supervision would be all but impossible. 
Moreover, the defendant has access to innumerable means to flee. His sex registration 
documentation of "current vehicles" lists no fewer than 15 motor vehicles, including seven 
Chevrolet Suburbans, a cargo van, a Range Rover, a Mercedez-Benz sedan, a Cadillac Escalade, 
and a Hummer II. These cars are registered in various states and territories including the Virgin 
Islands, New York, Florida, and New Mexico. The defendant also has access to two private jets, 
giving him the ability to leave the country secretly and on a moment's notice and to go virtually 
anywhere he wants to travel. He is a very frequent international traveler and regularly travels to 
and from the United States by private plane. In particular, between January 1, 2018, and the 
present, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol has logged approximately more than 20 flights in which 
Epstein was traveling to or from a foreign country. Indeed, he was arrested at Teterboro Airport 
arriving on just such a private international flight after having spent approximately three weeks 
abroad. Extensive international travel of this nature further demonstrates a significant risk of 
flight. See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp. 2d 32, 36 (D.D.C. 2005). There can be 
no assurance that, upon release, the defendant would suddenly lack access to such means of travel. 
Finally, the defendant has no meaningful ties that would keep him in this country. The 
defendant has no known immediate family. He is not married and has no children. He has friends 
and associates worldwide, as demonstrated by his extensive international travel, and his 
professional obligations, if any, can and seemingly are plainly capable of being handled by the 
defendant remotely. Simply put, there would be no meaningful reason for the defendant to remain 
in the country, while he would have every incentive (and every resource needed) to flee. 
Nor would home confinement with electronic monitoring reasonably assure the 
defendant's presence as required. At best, home confinement with electronic monitoring would 
EFTA00024590
--- PAGE 8 ---
Honorable Henry Pitman 
United States Magistrate Judge 
July 8, 2019 
Page 8 
merely reduce his head start should he decide to flee. See United States v. Zarger, No. 00 Cr. 773, 
2000 WL 1134364, at *1 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2000) (Gleeson, J.) (rejecting defendant's application 
for bail in part because home detention with electronic monitoring "at best . . limits a fleeing 
defendant's head start"); see also United States v. Casteneda, No. 18 Cr. 047, 2018 WL 888744, 
at *9 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 2018) (same); United States v. Anderson, 384 F.Supp.2d 32, 41 (D.D.C. 
2005) (same); United States v. Benatar, No. 02 Cr. 099, 2002 WL 31410262, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. 
Oct. 10, 2002) (same). 
Finally, there can be little doubt that the defendant is in a position to abandon millions of 
dollars in cash and property securing any potential bond and still live comfortably for the rest of 
his life. These resources, and the ease with which the defendant could flee and live outside the 
reach of law enforcement—particularly considering his vast wealth and lack of meaningful ties to 
this District—make the risk of flight exceptionally high in this case, particularly when considered 
in conjunction with the strength of the government's case and the lengthy sentence the defendant 
could receive if convicted. 
B. The Defendant Poses a Risk of Danger to the Community and of Engaging in 
Obstruction of Justice 
The release of the defendant, under any conditions, would pose a significant threat to the 
community and to the ongoing investigation. 
As described above, where there is probable cause to believe that an individual has 
committed an offense under 18 U.S.C. § 1591, it is presumed that no condition or combination of 
conditions can reasonably assure the safety of the community. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(3). Here, not 
only is the defendant charged with very serious sex crimes against minors, he has already 
previously admitted to—and been convicted of—engaging in related conduct. Specifically, in 
June 2008, the defendant pled guilty in state court to one count of procuring a person under the 
age of 18 for prostitution, a felony, and he currently is a registered sex offender, under 
classification level three in New York—defined as presenting a "high" risk of committing another 
sex crime and harm to the community. While the conduct presently alleged does not post-date the 
2008 conviction, it nevertheless underscores the risk he poses to the community if released. 
Additionally, and in connection with the investigation of the defendant's offense in Florida, 
there were credible allegations that the defendant engaged in witness tampering, harassment, or 
other obstructive behaviors. In fact, according to publicly-filed court documents, there were 
discussions between prosecutors and the defendant's then-counsel about the possibility of the 
defendant pleading guilty to counts relating to "obstruction," as well as "harassment," with 
reference to 18 U.S.C. § 1512, which criminalizes "[t]ampering with a witness, victim, or 
informant." For example, in a communication from the defendant's then-counsel to prosecutors 
in SDFL, his counsel set forth a possible factual proffer that included statements that the defendant 
had "attempted to harass both [redacted] delay and hinder their receipt of a [redacted] to attend an 
official proceeding" and that the defendant "in particular, changed travel plans and flew with both 
[redacted] to the United States Virgin Islands rather than to an airport in New Jersey in order to 
attempt to delay their receipt of what Mr. Epstein expected to be a [redacted]" and "further verbally 
EFTA00024591
--- PAGE 9 ---
Honorable Henry Pitman 
United States Magistrate Judge 
July 8, 2019 
Page 9 
harassed both [redacted] in connection to this attempt to delay their voluntary receipt of process 
all in violation of 18 USC 1512(d)(1)."5 Doe v. United States, 08 Civ. 80736 (S.D. Fla.), Dkts. 
361 at 3-4, 361-7 through 361-11. In addition to 18 U.S.C. § 1512(d), prosecutors also proposed 
that the defendant could plead guilty to 18 U.S.C. § 403, that is, a knowing or intentional violation 
of the privacy protection of child victims and child witnesses, to which the defendant's then-
counsel replied: "Already thinking about the same statutes." Id. Dkt. 361-11. They also discussed 
a possible obstruction plea that "could rely on the incident where Mr. Epstein's private 
investigators followed [redacted] father, forcing off the road." Id. Dkt. 361-10. 
The defendant's apparent previous willingness to obstruct a federal investigation, harass or 
tamper with witnesses, and hire private investigators that "forc[edf off the road" the father of an 
individual relevant in the investigation is alarming. It should especially weigh on the Court's 
consideration here because the defendant was apparently willing to take those steps before even 
being charged and thus facing federal indictment; the incentive to interfere in the Government's 
case here, where an Indictment has been returned, is exponentially greater. And as discussed 
above, the defendant has nearly limitless means to do so. 
Finally, despite having been previously convicted of a sex offense involving an underage 
victim, the defendant has continued to maintain a vast trove of lewd photographs of young-looking 
women or girls in his Manhattan mansion. In a search of the New York Residence on the night of 
his arrest, on July 6-7, 2019, pursuant to judicially-authorized warrants, law enforcement officers 
discovered not only specific evidence consistent with victim recollections of the inside of the 
mansion, further strengthening the evidence of the conduct charged in the Indictment, but also at 
least hundreds—and perhaps thousands-of sexually suggestive photographs of fully- or partially-
nude females. While these items were only seized this weekend and are still being reviewed, some 
of the nude or partially-nude photographs appear to be of underage girls, including at least one girl 
who, according to her counsel, was underage at the time the relevant photographs were taken. 
Additionally, some of the photographs referenced herein were discovered in a locked safe, in which 
law enforcement officers also found compact discs with hand-written labels including the 
following: "Young [Name] + [Name]," "Misc nudes 1," and "Girl pics nude." The defendant, a 
registered sex offender, is not reformed, he is not chastened, he is not repentant,' rather, he is a 
continuing danger to the community and an individual who faces devastating evidence supporting 
deeply serious charges. 
The redactions above are contained in the publicly filed version of the quoted document.

yesterday. `It's the difference between a murderer and a person who steals a bagel.'"); Philip

close to the sun,' I said. 'Did Icarus like massages?' Epstein asked.").

CONCLUSION 
As set forth above, in this case, the risk of flight in this case is extraordinarily real. The 
defendant is extremely wealthy, has extensive foreign contacts, and is charged with serious 
offenses that carry a potential statutory sentence of up to 45 years' imprisonment—even a fraction 
of which could result in the defendant, who is 66 years old, spending the rest of his life in jail. In 
sum, the defendant's transient lifestyle, his lack of family or community ties, his extensive 
international travel and ties outside the country, and his vast wealth, including his access to and 
ownership of private planes, all provide the defendant with the motive and means to become a 
successful fugitive. Further, the nature of the offenses he is alleged to have perpetrated—the abuse 
dozens of underage, vulnerable girls—along with his demonstrated willingness to harass, 
intimidate and otherwise tamper with victims and other potential witnesses against him, render his 
dangerousness readily apparent. 
Accordingly, the Government respectfully submits that the defendant cannot and will not 
be able to meet his burden of overcoming the strong presumption in favor of detention, that there 
are no conditions of bail that would assure the defendant's presence in court proceedings in this 
case or protect the safety of the community, and that any application for bail should be denied.
