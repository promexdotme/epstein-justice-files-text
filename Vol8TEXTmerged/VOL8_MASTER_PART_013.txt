Epstein. The bank would like to close all of the accounts of the entities named in the SAR as soon as possible. (The 
current balance on those accounts is approximately $30 million.) Before doing so, the bank wanted to make your office

As you are undoubtedly aware, there has been some press coverage since yesterday about the release pursuant to FOIA 
of some USMS records. I just spoke with the Associate General Counsel at the USMS, who wanted to provide us with 
the actual source materials (USM 11s (equivalent of 302s)) that were inadvertently released, because they were not in 
all circumstances accurately reported, and he wanted to make sure that if we are concerned about any harm to our 
investigation from the release, that we have the original materials. He also offered to serve as a POC if we have any 
questions.

LLP, and to me specifically. See the signed authorization form enclosed. 
is our client and we are obtaining her records on her behalf. This is a priority 
over all other aspects of our record requests contained in the eight referenced FOIA requests. 
Specifically, records related to complaints filed by her against Jeffrey Epstein in New York are 
requested on an expedited basis if possible. 
Second, in regard to Jeffrey Epstein (DOB: 01/20/1953). Records concerning Epstein were 
requested in FOIA requests: EOUSA-2019-003549, EOUSA-2019-003550, EOUSA-2019-

Attorney's Offices for the District of New Mexico, Southern District of New York, District of the 
Virgin Islands, Southern District of Florida, and Northern District of Georgia respectively. 
Subsequent to our original request, Jeffrey Epstein died on August 10, 2019. Given that Epstein 
died in Federal custody while facing Federal charges, and the resulting media attention, we assume 
that the Department of Justice is well aware of his death. As Jeffrey Epstein is now deceased, any 
privacy concerns are extinguished. We therefore renew our request for all records pertaining to

Thank you for your email. Your proposal is largely acceptable to us, with the following modifications and clarifications. 
• For the items that you propose below to exclude from the evidence transported to 500 Pearl Street (with the 
exception of the cash held at 26 Federal Plaza), we will need to have access for a lawyer, investigator and paralegal 
to inspect and photograph those items at the Bronx warehouse. This seems to include the bulky items, electronic 
devices and "fragile" items. 
o Once they are photographed and shared with the team and our client, we can decide whether a separate 
inspection by our client and/or any expert is necessary at a later time. To be clear, the government's photos 
of these same items are insufficient. 
o If there are any items we are not permitted to photograph (and perhaps you will be able to tell us by April 5 
which those are), we likely will need to have those transported because there is no way for our client to 
inspect the evidence. We can wait to finalize this issue until you have finished deciding what items you 
consider non-photographable, and if we can't agree, then discuss next steps. 
o Please let us know when these "non-transportable" items can be inspected and photographed at the Bronx 
warehouse. It makes sense that it would be done soon so that we can raise any issues as necessary with the 
Court. 
• For playing any of the electronic media, we will obtain the necessary equipment to play at 500 Pearl Street and 
seek permission to bring those devices into the Courthouse. You can segregate out the section of recordings that 
contain "witness statements" and advise us then which ones cannot be played, but we still need to inspect the 
outside of those recordings. 
• As far as space, can you please advise whether the largest proffer room will be available for review of evidence? It 
is my understanding that it can accommodate a large number of the team members at one time. If not, is a locked 
courtroom available for us to review the evidence? The agents could bring out a limited number of boxes at a time 
for inspection. 
• We understand that the evidence will not be taken outside of the monitoring of the agents or your staff and 
appreciate that you will have a separate room for us to consult with our client privately (without the evidence). 
• We understand that all of the highly confidential materials, including not only the 2,100 images not previously 
disclosed as well as the electronic images that were only shown to NY counsel and the client at the MDC, will be 
available for review on a singular laptop at 500 Pearl Street. 
• We also understand the 7 hard-copy highly confidential materials will also be available for inspection at 500 Pearl 
Street. 
Please let me know if you have any questions or disagree with my understanding. If you agree, we can then proceed as 
scheduled on April 12 and continue day to day until we are finished, with a break if necessary for the arraignment.

Counsel, 
Thank you for your email. Below please find our response. If this is acceptable to you, then we will proceed with 
arranging the logistics of having your client produced to 500 Pearl the week of April 12th and the week April 19th. We will 
also arrange for the FBI to transport evidence to 500 Pearl for review the week of April 12th. 
Physical Evidence 
• It is not reasonable or feasible to insist that the FBI bring all physical evidence to 500 Pearl Street. That said, we are 
certainly willing to work with you to ensure that your client can review any physical items that are material to the 
preparation of her defense. 
• We would propose excluding the below items from production to 500 Pearl: 
o We appreciate your note that the massage tables are not needed, which will certainly help with the logistics 
of transport. 
o We also appreciate your indication that the cash items from 26 Federal Plaza do not need to be produced. 
Those are the only items not located in the Bronx warehouse. 
o The FBI has seized dozens of electronic devices, including desktop computers, servers, and laptops, from 
Jeffrey Epstein's residences in 2019. Photographs of those devices were produced in our August 2020 
productions as part of the search warrant photographs, and you have received copies of the data that was 
seized from those devices pursuant to a warrant. The production of these devices would be very 
cumbersome, and we do not see any value in looking at an electronic device that cannot be turned on. 
o The framed pictures are bulky and cumbersome to transport. These are also very delicate and are difficult 
to transport. Photographs of those seized images were already provided to you as part of the photographs 
from the searches of Epstein's residences. 
o Certain items seized from the New York residence are bulky, fragile, and/or difficult to transport. These 
include plaster busts of female torsos and a stuffed dog. Photographs of these items were already provided 
to you from the search of the New York residence. 
• The remaining physical items of evidence would fit into approximately 15 to 20 boxes. The FBI has indicated that it 
would be feasible to transport those boxes to 500 Pearl Street. 
• Regarding your request for equipment that can play the recordings, we believe they would require a VCR, a cassette 
player, a CD player, an adapter for a micro VHS tape, and a microcassette player. If you wish to play these 
recordings at 500 Pearl, you will need to provide that equipment. We have asked the FBI whether any other 
equipment would be necessary and will let you know if that is the case prior to the date of your review. It is our 
understanding that any recordings that are not witness statements and that are not highly confidential have been 
produced to you in discovery. We are not aware of any discoverable, non-highly confidential, recordings that were 
not produced to you as part of the Government's discovery productions in the fall. To confirm that understanding, 
we are working with the FBI to physically doublecheck each recording. If we identify any discoverable recordings 
that have not already been produced, we will promptly provide them to you. 
EFTA00032466
--- PAGE 3 ---
• The segregation of highly confidential material will require the FBI and an AUSA to physically review each item to 
confirm the item's status. We will endeavor to do so by your requested date of April 5, 2021. 
• We can confirm that neither the AUSA(s) nor the agent(s) will record or attempt to record any part of the evidence 
review or conversations among the defense team or with the defendant during this review. Although the evidence 
cannot be left outside of the presence of an agent, we will ensure that a room is available for the defense team and 
the defendant to confer privately away from the agent(s) and the AUSA(s) without monitoring. 
• As for your request for a space large enough to fit 8 members of the defense team, the defendant, an agent, an 
AUSA, and the evidence, my office cannot control the space that the Marshals allow us to use at 500 Pearl outside 
of the proffer rooms. We will certainly request as large a space as possible, but if we are required to use the 
proffer rooms, then members of the defense team may need to rotate in and out of the room. I know members of 
the defense team have been in those proffer rooms before, and they can hopefully provide some thoughts on how 
we might use the proffer room space effectively for your purposes. If the Court grants authorization for the 
defense to bring electronic devices into 500 Pearl, that is certainly fine with the Government, and you may note our 
consent in your request to Judge Nathan for such authorization. 
Highly Confidential Electronic Images 
• The 2,100 electronic images were recovered during the responsiveness review of images and videos seized from 
Jeffrey Epstein's devices, which review was not complete until early November 2020. We indicated on page 4 the 
cover letter to our November 9, 2020 production, which included all other images and videos from those devices, 
that "the Federal Bureau of Investigation ('FBI') seized multiple nude and partially nude images from several for the 
above-listed electronic devices. All such images have been designated Highly Confidential. The FBI will make these 
images available for review by the defense upon request." We did not receive a request from the defense to review 
these images until your March 8, 2021 letter, which requested to "view and inspect all materials designated by your 
office as 'Highly Confidential' under the terms of the Protective Order". 
• We did not ask the FBI to bring the 7 hard copy images to the MDC in the fall because we did not understand you to 
be requesting a review of physical, non-electronic evidence during those meetings. Our understanding of the 
defense request at that time was to review the electronic highly confidential images that were recovered from CDs 
from Epstein's residence. We will ensure that the 7 hard copy images are available to you for review at 500 Pearl.

EFTA00032467

We have considered your proposal. Unfortunately, it does not permit us an adequate ability to review the evidence in the 
case and does not permit our client to meaningfully participate in her own defense. 
First, we are unable to meaningfully review the evidence without the benefit of our laptops and other electronic devices 
which are needed to take notes of our review. We also need access to our devices during the review to compare the 
physical evidence with the electronic discovery and with our work product. 
Second, we need to provide our client the ability to review all discovery, including any recordings, in order to assist in her 
own defense. Presuming that she will not be taken to the FBI downtown office, then your proposal offers no means by 
which she can both inspect a recording in its physical form and listen to the recording at the same time. 
In order to address the deficiencies in your proposal, we believe the following are necessary: 
Physical Evidence 
• All of the physical evidence currently located in the FBI Bronx warehouse will be transported to 500 Pearl Street 
and made available during the week of April 12, with our client present, in a room sufficiently large to 
accommodate 8 attorneys and investigators. 
o We do not need the "bulky" massage tables transported; if there are any other extremely large evidence 
pieces, let us know what they are and we can consider whether we can have someone review and 
photograph those at the Bronx warehouse at an earlier time. 
o From your email, it appears that only two items are not located at the Bronx warehouse — both envelopes 
with cash. Please confirm this. We do not need the two "cash" evidence items transported to 500 Pearl. 
o If there are other evidence items housed somewhere other than the Bronx, please let us know what they are 
and where they are. 
• We will be permitted to bring our laptops, and a camera, into 500 Pearl Street; we are happy to seek permission 
from Judge Nathan to do so. 
• Either the FBI can provide the equipment necessary to listen to any of the recordings at 500 Pearl Street or we can 
bring the necessary equipment. If we are to provide the equipment, we will need to know in advance the formats 
of each recording so that we can be prepared. You can note that on your Excel spreadsheet by the item number by 
March 29 to give us adequate time to secure the necessary equipment. 
• The FBI can segregate any physical evidence that you deem "highly confidential." You can identify any "highly 
confidential" physical evidence items on your Excel spreadsheets by April 5 (one week before the evidence view). If 
we need to photograph or reproduce any such item for expert evaluation, we will seek leave of court. Otherwise, 
we will not photograph any such items during the review during the week of April 12. This will ensure the evidence 
review proceeds smoothly and there will not be any need to ask permission to photograph on an item by item 
basis. 
• The FBI also can segregate any recordings which we will be able to inspect, but not listen to, during the evidence 
view the week of April 12. You can note such designation on your Excel spreadsheet. If we disagree, we can seek 
leave of the Court in advance. 
• We understand that an FBI Agent and/or AUSA may be present during our physical evidence review at 500 Pearl 
Street but of course must ensure that no recordings are made of our conversations and also ensure that there is a 
separate, secure room in which we can confer with our client during the evidence view without monitoring by the 
government. 
• Please confirm whether all electronic recordings (other than the highly-confidential images and videos described 
below) have previously been produced to us, and if not, please explain which ones were not produced by the 
discovery deadlines last fall and why. 
Highly Confidential Electronic Evidence 
• Can you please explain why 2,100 + 7 "highly confidential" images have not been shared with us yet? It was our 
understanding that you previously provided all "highly confidential" images to our client — and to defense counsel —
for review at the MDC in November. We are confused about where these previously undisclosed items were 
located and why they have not yet been made available for inspection and review. 
• During the week of April 19, Ms. Maxwell should be produced to 500 Pearl Street to review (with counsel and a 
defense staff member, on the 1 laptop provided) all of the 5,507 electronic images and video marked "highly 
EFTA00032468
--- PAGE 5 ---
confidential". These should be segregated into the three categories you describe (never-before produced, 
previously produced, and the 7 hard-copy images). 
Please let us know if you will not agree to any of these steps so that we can address the issues with the Court. 
Thank you.

Subject: RE: US v. Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes 
All, 
Attached please find two spreadsheets documenting all physical evidence in the FBI's custody, as well as a corresponding 
discovery cover letter. We are sending a copy of these files to the MDC for your client as well. 
In response to your questions, the FBI has informed me of the following: 
Regarding the Highly Confidential nude/partially nudge images to be reviewed at 500 Pearl: 
• There are three categories of these images: 
o Approximately 2,100 electronic images and videos seized from Epstein's electronic devices (which have not 
been previously provided to you) 
o Approximately 3,400 electronic images from discs seized from Epstein's residences in 2019 (which have 
previously been provided to you and your client for review at the MDC) 
o Approximately 7 hard copy nude images located in the file from the FBI Florida office's investigation of 
Epstein (which have not been previously provided to you) 
• The FBI will make all three of those categories available to you. The electronic files will be provided on hard drives, 
and the FBI will provide you with the hard copy images for review as well. 
o All electronic images should be viewable as thumbnails, except those seized from Apple devices, which must 
be viewed using Cellebrite. 
o The Cellebrite software will be provided on the drive for your review of images and videos seized from Apple 
devices. 
o The electronic files have the same metadata on the hard drive that was available when the FBI seized each 
image. For images that were carved or deleted, no metadata was recovered, so none is viewable. For all 
other images, the metadata recovered should be viewable on the hard drive. 
o The approximately 2,100 electronic images and videos seized from Epstein's devices are separated by folder 
to indicate which device each image was seized from. 
• Because these images are considered obscene material, the FBI is not permitted to make duplicates of them, and 
there is a limited number of clean laptops on which these images can be reviewed. As a result, the FBI is only able 
to provide a single laptop for review of these images. 
Regarding the physical evidence: 
• Attached are two lists of all physical items in the FBI's custody relating to this case. The first list relates to items 
associated with the FBI Florida office's investigation of Epstein. The second list relates to items associated with the 
FBI New York office's current investigation. 
EFTA00032469
--- PAGE 6 ---
• The vast majority of physical evidence in the FBI's custody is located at the FBI's warehouse in the Bronx. Two 
items (1B 77 & 1B 79) are located at 26 Federal Plaza, but the case agents can check those items out from 26 
Federal Plaza and bring them to the Bronx warehouse on whatever day you choose to conduct your review so that 
you will have all evidence in one place. 
• The FBI is able to arrange for the defense team to review all physical evidence at the Bronx warehouse under the 
following conditions: 
o The warehouse requires at least two weeks' notice in order to pull all of the items for the entire case and 
place them in a location where a large group of people can view them. 
o The warehouse is open during normal business hours between 9am and 5pm on weekdays. 
o At least two FBI agents and an AUSA will be present at the Bronx warehouse to assist and answer questions. 
o The evidence will be placed in a loading dock at the warehouse to provide additional space for the review. 
To ensure that there is sufficient space, please let me know how many members of the defense team intend 
to be physically present for this review. 
o Electronic devices such as cellphones and laptops are not permitted in the warehouse. The defense team 
may bring a digital camera that is not connected to the Internet or a cellular network into the warehouse. If 
the defense team wishes to photograph an item of evidence, the defense will need to inform the agents who 
are present, so that they may confirm that the photographed item is not Highly Confidential based on the 
presence of nudity. 
o Electronic media such as VHS tapes, cassette tapes, and CDs will not be playable at the warehouse. 
• To the extent the defense requests that the FBI bring any physical items to 500 Pearl Street for your client to review, 
the FBI is prepared to bring items that are reasonably sized to 500 Pearl Street. With respect to bulky or large 
items, the defense team should be able to photograph those for your client to review, unless they are deemed 
Highly Confidential, in which case the FBI can make arrangements to transport the item to 500 Pearl Street if 
necessary. 
• The FBI is in the process of confirming that it can provide devices to play all of the electronic media in the case in a 
single location at the FBI's offices in downtown Manhattan. We are also double-checking to confirm that all media 
that does not contain witness statements have already been produced to you and your client in discovery. The FBI 
anticipates that we can arrange for you to review all non-witness statement electronic media at the FBI's office in 
downtown Manhattan in approximately three weeks. 
o To the extent you wish to review all of the discs containing photographs, which were seized from Epstein's 
residences in 2019, we note that all of those images have already been produced to you in discovery. For 
your awareness, the FBI has informed me that it took their team several weeks to review all of the images on 
all of those discs. 
Please let me know how you wish to proceed.

Now that the FBI team is back, when do you expect to have answers to all of the questions posed? If I had an idea of 
when you would have answers, it could help me answer your question. 
At a minimum, it would not seem to take too much time to know when someone can open the FBI vault and allow the 
attorneys to make an initial view of the evidence. Also, I understand the FBI did not prepare an inventory of their 
evidence when they seized it from NY and LSJ, so I don't think we need to wait for them to now prepare an inventory 
before we start reviewing evidence. 
Also, when do you believe you will have a response regarding the discovery I requested last Monday? 
Thanks, 
Laura

Counsel, 
The FBI team on this case has been out of the office this week and will not be able to answer all of the questions you 
asked during our Wednesday call until they are back in the office next week. Please let me know if you would like to wait 
until all of those questions can be answered to schedule a day for your client to be brought to 500 Pearl Street to review 
the highly confidential images. My understanding is that the FBI is able to provide at least one laptop containing those 
highly confidential images in time for such a review to take place on Thursday 5/18, but I may not have the answers to all 
of your questions about those images before that date, and I do not know whether you will also be able to visit the 
evidence vault that same week. 
Please let me know how you would like to proceed. I will reach back out once I have answers to your questions. 
Thank you,

That is the only excel spreadsheet indexing physical evidence that we have produced in discovery. That spreadsheet does 
not include every physical item currently in the FBI's custody related to this case. For example, the August 20, 2020 
discovery production also included search warrant returns listing the physical items seized by the FBI's New York Office 
during the 2019 searches of Jeffrey Epstein's residences in New York and the U.S Virgin Islands (see Bates range 
SDNY_GM_00166007-SDNY_GM_00166043), but they are not contained in a spreadsheet. 
As a courtesy, I have asked the FBI whether it would be possible to provide us with a similar excel index reflecting the 
physical evidence seized by the FBI's New York Office, though it may take some time to compile such an index. 
Best,

Counsel, 
In advance of our call tomorrow, I wanted to send a copy of the attached index of physical items in FBI custody from the 
FBI-Miami office, which we previously produced to you as part of our August 21, 2020 discovery production. Also 
included in that August 21, 2020 production were scans of numerous items listed on the index. Those scans can be found 
within Bates range SDNY_GM_00172218-SDNY_GM_00173007. It may be useful to reference some of those items during 
our conversation tomorrow, so I wanted to make sure you were aware of them.

Hi all, 
MI and I are heading to Los Angeles in late August to prep with a number of trial witnesses in the Maxwell case. In 
advance of the trip, I'm going to begin drafting q&as, and it would be super helpful to have a binder with some 
information about two of the witnesses. When you can, could someone please put together a binder with all witness 
interview notes and 302s for the following two witnesses? Thanks so much. No labels on the binders needed — just tabs 
with dates of interviews would be great (e.g., M., 7-6-19 interview).

HE— FYI, Congressman Lois Frankel from FL left 
a VM saying that Congress wants to look into the Epstein 
case but one of the victim's lawyers said she should reach out to 
first. (Unclear how this would fit under her 
current committee assignments on the Appropriations Committee and Veterans Affairs Committee...) My thought is that 
this should be routed to OLA and they should handle the request/response in a more formal way; do you have a different 
view? If you agree, who's the best person to reach out to? Thanks very much.

Foreign Travel Guidance During the COVID-19 Pandemic 
State Department Travel Advisory 
The Department of State has issued travel advisories to Level 4 (Do Not Travel) designated locations. They also advise to reconsider 
travel abroad at this time due to the impact of COVID-19. Many areas throughout the world are experiencing outbreaks and are taking 
actions that may limit traveler mobility, including quarantines and border restrictions. Even countries without reported cases of COVID-
are taking measures and may restrict travel without notice. Please view the Department of State's Travel Advisory Webpage for the 
most updated information. 
Official Passports 
Due to public health measures to limit the spread of COVID-19, effective immediately, the Department of States Special Issuance 
Agency (SIA) are only offering service to issue passports for customers with a qualified life-or-death emergency with a need to be issued 
a passport for international travel within 72 hours. SIA defines life-or-death as a serious illness, injury, or death in one's immediate family 
(e.g., parent, sibling, aunt uncle, dependent, etc.). This means official passports will not be processed during this time until further 
notice. If an employee without an official passport needs to complete essential international travel, and they have a valid tourist 
passport, they must obtain approval from the host country via email to travel in their official capacity on a tourist 
passport, and submit that approval with all of the usually required foreign travel documentation and approvals to 
Fly America Act 
Please email the 
mailbox if you have a safety related need to request an exception to the Fly America Act

SEC called again with some questions on their Epstein inquiry. They mainly want to continue to avoid anything that would

I have previously-scheduled travel to San Francisco next Thursday for a wedding, and the way our victims have asked 
to schedule our meetings for our Florida trip, there's no flight back to New York after we expect the interviews to end on 
Wednesday (so I couldn't get back to NYC to catch my Thursday morning flight). Is it permissible for me to just book the 
second leg of the work trip straight to San Francisco, rather than back to New York? I'd have to take a 5:30 a.m. flight but 
that way we could do the interviews with all the victims we'd like to meet with. Sorry for any inconvenience but wanted 
to check — thank you!

Prosecutors Broke Law In Epstein Plea Deal, Fla. Judge Says 
By Carolina Bolado 
Share us on: 
Law360 (February 21, 2019, 5:58 PM EST) --
Prosecutors, including then-U.S. Attorney and current 
Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta, violated the 
Crime Victims' Rights Act when they signed a non-
prosecution agreement with billionaire sex offender 
Jeffrey Epstein without notifying his victims, a 
Florida federal judge ruled Thursday. 
Prosecutors failed to comply with their obligations to 
inform the victims of Jeffrey Epstein, shown in 2004, 
that they intended to enter into an agreement not to 
prosecute him, a judge said Thursday. (Getty) 
U.S. District Judge Kenneth A. Marra granted 
summary judgment to two Epstein victims who sued 
the government over the deal and said federal 
prosecutors failed to comply with their obligations 
under the CVRA to inform Epstein's victims that they 
intended to enter into an agreement not to prosecute 
him. 
The government's decision to hide its intentions and 
to tell victims to just be patient with the investigation 
was "particularly problematic," according to the 
judge. 
EFTA00032506
--- PAGE 2 ---
"When the government gives information to victims, 
it cannot be misleading," Judge Marra said. "While 
the government spent untold hours negotiating the 
terms and implications of the NPA with Epstein's 
attorneys, scant information was shared with victims. 
Instead, the victims were told to be 'patient' while the 
investigation proceeded." 
Judge Marra rejected the government's claim that the 
CVRA requires victims to be notified only of a plea 
bargain or a deferred prosecution agreement, both of 
which are more common than a non-prosecution 
agreement, according to the opinion. But that reading 
of the law is "inconsistent with the goal of the 
CVRA," the judge said. 
"The expansive context of the CVRA lends itself to 
only one interpretation; namely, that victims should 
be notified of significant events resulting in 
resolution of their case without a trial," Judge Marra 
said. 
The ruling is a big win for the two Epstein victims, 
listed as Jane Does, who sued the government in 
2008 alleging the U.S. Attorney's Office for the 
Southern District of Florida violated the CVRA with 
the Epstein deal. 
The CVRA grants crime victims a number of rights, 
including the right to be informed of public court 
proceedings and not to be excluded from those 
proceedings. The Miami Herald, in an investigative 
report published late last year, printed emails 
showing that the alleged victims were deliberately 
excluded from the deal cut between Acosta, who was 
then the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of 
Florida, and Epstein's defense team. 
Epstein's alleged victims — numbering in the dozens 
— claim he lured teenage girls to his Palm Beach, 
Florida, mansion to engage in sexual acts. They have 
EFTA00032507
--- PAGE 3 ---
not had the opportunity to testify in court in any 
proceeding thus far, according to the Herald report. 
Bradley Edwards, who represents the victims suing 
the government, called Judge Marra's decision a 
"clear victory and long-overdue vindication for all of 
the victims." 
"It is unfortunate that at no time during the past 10 
years has the government acknowledged its clear 
violation of the rights of dozens of crime victims," 
Edwards said. "Hopefully now they will stop 
defending what was clearly an improper agreement, 
apologize directly and unequivocally, and work to 
make it right." 
Judge Marra said the parties have 15 days to tell the 
court how they wish to proceed to determine any 
appropriate remedies. Edwards said the primary 
remedy is the invalidation of the non-prosecution 
agreement. 
A U.S. Department of Labor spokeswoman said the 
actions of the U.S. Attorney's Office in this case 
"have been defended by the Department of Justice in 
litigation across three administrations and several 
attorneys general." She said any further comment 
would have to come from the DOJ. 
The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District 
of Florida declined to comment. 
The DOJ has opened an investigation into whether its 
attorneys engaged in misconduct when negotiating 
the controversial deal with Epstein, according to a 
letter sent earlier this month to Sen. Ben Sasse, R-
Neb., who repeatedly pushed for such an 
investigation. The letter said the DOJ's Office of 
Professional Responsibility had opened an 
investigation into the deal. 
EFTA00032508
--- PAGE 4 ---
It was after reading the investigative report by the 
Herald that Sasse became concerned and sent two 
letters to the DOJ urging the agency to investigate. 
The Herald's three-part series, "Perversion of 
Justice," showed how Acosta and other DOJ 
attorneys worked closely with defense lawyers to 
craft a lenient plea deal for Epstein in 2008. 
The series was published just before Epstein was set 
to go to trial in a civil dispute with Edwards, who had 
filed a malicious prosecution claim against Epstein. 
The trial was to have featured testimony from some 
of his victims. But just before jury selection was set 
to begin, an attorney for Edwards announced a 
settlement, while Epstein's attorney read an apology 
from his client to Edwards. 
The victims are represented by Bradley Edwards 
of Edwards Pottinger LLC, Jay C. Howell of Jay 
Howell & Associates PA, John Scarola of Searcy 
Denney Scarola Barnhart & Shipley PA and Paul G. 
Cassell of the University of Utah's S.J. Quinney 
College of Law. 
The government is represented by Ann Marie C. 
Villafana and Dexter Lee of the U.S. Attorney's 
Office for the Southern District of Florida. 
The case is Doe et al. v. U.S., case number 9:08-cv-
80736, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern 
District of Florida.

ITEM. 
BYLINE 
TEXT 
BY JAMES HOHMANN 
with Mariana Altaro 
THE BIG IDEA: Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) is a former CIA analyst who 
served three tours in Iraq as one of the American government's foremost 
experts on Iranian-backed Shiite militias before being appointed as an 
assistant secretary of defense with a focus on the Middle East. But that's not 
the only experience that motivated Slotkin to draft the resolution limiting President 
Trump's ability to take additional military action against Iran without congressional 
approval, which passed the House last night on a mostly party-line vote. 
EFTA00032518
--- PAGE 2 ---
The freshman congresswoman's son-in-law is an active-duty Army officer 
stationed at the al-Asad air base in western Iraq, which the Iranians hit with 11 
ballistic missiles this week in retaliation for the drone strike that killed Quds Force 
commander Qasem Soleimani. Slotkin's husband also served 30 years in the Army, 
retiring as a colonel, and her stepdaughter followed in his footsteps. She was not 
long ago commissioned as an active-duty Army officer. 
"For me, this is not a theoretical exercise," Slotkin explained on Thursday 
evening. "If our loved ones are going to be sent to fight in any protracted war, the 
president owes the American public a conversation. ... Congress has long 
abdicated its responsibility as laid out in the Constitution to make the hard 
decisions we owe our troops." 
Such deeply personal investment in the war effort blunts hyperbolic attacks 
from Republican lawmakers - especially those who have never served in uniform 
and don't have relatives on the battlefield — that opposing the escalation of conflict 
in the Middle East or supporting Congress asserting its constitutional role is 
somehow unpatriotic. 
The debate now moves to the Senate, which could vote as early as next 
week, where it faces a more uncertain future. At least four Republicans need to 
vote for the resolution to ensure passage when it comes up, as early as next week. 
Whatever the Senate passes, if anything, would then need to be approved by the 
House before going to Trump, who has promised a veto that there would not be the 
votes to override. 
Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), the lead sponsor of the accompanying resolution in that 
chamber, isn't just a member of the Armed Services and Foreign Relations 
committees. Kaine's oldest son, Nat, is an active-duty Marine infantry officer 
who has been deployed overseas multiple times. 
EFTA00032519

McCarthy continues to accuse Pelosi of 'defending Soleimani' 
-- The Republican messaging machine has gone into overdrive this 
week, with what has felt at times like a competition among party leaders to see 
who could offer up the most incendiary quote questioning the motives of 
Democratic lawmakers concerned about the possibility of a full-scale war against 
Iran without congressional approval. 
"This is a meaningless vote that only sends the wrong message that the House 
Democrats would rather stand with the socialist base than stand against Iran," 
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said at his weekly news 
conference on Thursday. 
"Whether you mean to or not, you're empowering the enemy," said Sen. Lindsey 
Graham (R-S.C.), the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, referring to 
lawmakers who vote for the resolution. 
"They are in love with terrorists," said Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.), the top 
Republican on the House Judiciary Committee. "We see that they mourn Soleimani 
more than they mourn our Gold Star families," Collins told Lou Dobbs on Fox 
Business. 
-- Democrats have decided not to just brush aside comments like this. "I left 
literal parts of my body in Iraq, where I was fighting terrorists," said Sen. Tammy 
Duckworth (D-Ill.), who has used a wheelchair since her Black Hawk helicopter 
was shot down over Iraq in 2004. "Donald Trump spent months attacking an 
ACTUAL Gold Star Family," she added on Twitter. "[Collins] should be ashamed of 
himself for perpetuating this offensive lie." 
Duckworth is referring to when Trump, who received a deferment for "bone spurs" 
to avoid being drafted during the Vietnam War, mocked Khizr and Ghazala Khan. 
Their son Humayun was killed in action as an Army captain in Iraq. The Khans 
EFTA00032520
--- PAGE 4 ---
spoke out against Trump at the Democratic convention in 2016, expressing 
concern about his proposed ban on Muslims entering the United States. 
-- Collins apologized this morning. "Let me be clear: I do not believe Democrats 
are in love with terrorists," he tweeted. "As someone who served in Iraq in 2008, I 
witnessed firsthand the brutal death of countless soldiers who were torn to shreds 
by this vicious terrorist. Soleimani was nothing less than an evil mastermind who 
viciously killed and wounded thousands of Americans. These images will live with 
me for the rest of my life, but that does not excuse my response on Wednesday 
evening." 
-- During the Thursday evening debate on the House floor, several Democrats 
emphasized their credentials as they made the case for the war powers 
resolution. Polls suggest that Democrats have tightened their traditional gap on 
which party is more trusted to handle national security. They won control of the 
House in the 2018 midterm elections thanks, in part, to a large cohort of young 
military veterans in swing districts. There are 96 veterans in this Congress, 
including 30 Democrats and 66 Republicans. 
One of those freshmen who delivered the majority is Rep. Jason Crow (D-
Colo.). He defeated a GOP incumbent in the Denver suburbs by touting his Army 
combat experience. "I have often heard folks say that now is not the time to 
discuss the use of force or the decision to send our men and women to fight," said 
Crow. "I heard that in 2003 when I was carrying a rifle in Baghdad. I heard it again 
in 2004 and 2005 when I was leading my unit through the mountains of 
Afghanistan. And I am hearing it again today in the halls of Congress. In the last 19 
years, more than 7,000 Americans have given their lives in these conflicts, 53,000 
have been wounded and we have spent over $4 trillion dollars of taxpayer money. 
"Do not believe the fearmongering," Crow concluded. "I may have laid down 
my rifle, but my oath to this country endures. I will fight to ensure that we are 
EFTA00032521
--- PAGE 5 ---
having a discussion about when to send our men and women, our sons and 
daughters, our sisters and brothers, into harm's way." 
Pelosi on Iran: 'We must avoid war' 
Slotkin left her Pentagon job to move home to Michigan after Trump took 
office. Then she toppled a longtime GOP incumbent the next year in the 
midterms. She faces a tough reelection battle this fall in a district Trump 
carried comfortably in 2016. The National Republican Congressional Committee 
has taken to calling her "pro-Iran Slotkin" in news releases. "Sit down, Elissa," one 
missive from the House GOP campaign arm said this week. 
Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), the former vice president's daughter, called into a 
news talk radio station in Slotkin's district on Thursday morning to attack her 
for the "appalling" resolution, which she said "will send a message to the 
Iranians that the country is not united behind the president." Cheney told 
WILS in Lansing, Mich., that Slotkin's resolution showed "there's a big difference 
between what she's saying at home and what she does when she gets here to 
Washington." 
In a speech on the House floor before the vote on resolution, Slotkin pushed 
back forcefully on these criticisms. "Soleimani was the lead architect of much of 
Iran's destabilizing activities in the Middle East and throughout the world," she said. 
"To that end, with Iran, or with any other adversary, the United States always has 
the inherent right and obligation to self-defense against imminent armed attacks. 
Always!" 
Slotkin lamented that the country has been at war for nearly two decades, 
but Congress has only voted twice in that time to authorize the use of 
military force: in 2001 and 2002. Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) was the lone 
EFTA00032522
--- PAGE 6 ---
member of Congress to vote against the authorization for the use of military force 
immediately after the 9/11 attacks, which is still being cited more than 18 years 
later as a legal rationale for U.S. activities in the Middle East. Only 1 in 4 House 
members today were in Congress back then. 
That 2001 authorization has been cited dozens of times, by three different 
presidents now, to justify deploying American troops to a list of countries 
that includes Libya, Turkey, Georgia, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, Eritrea, 
Ethiopia, Djibouti, Somalia, Kenya, the Philippines and Cuba. The language of 
Slotkin's nonbinding resolution instructs Trump "to terminate the use of United 
States Armed Forces to engage in hostilities in or against Iran or any part of its 
government or military" unless Congress either formally declares war or there is 
"an imminent armed attack upon the United States." 
"When it comes to the matter of longer-term war, we have a constitutional 
responsibility to authorize the use of military force," Slotkin reasoned. "The 
framers of our Constitution rightly believed that the power to declare war belongs in 
the Congress because this would ensure that the American people, through the 
legislators they elected, would weigh the most significant decision a government 
can make."

Rourke/AP) 
Slotkin's resolution passed 224 to 194, with the support of three 
Republicans plus independent Justin Amash of Michigan and the opposition 
of eight Democrats. The most notable vote for the resolution came from Rep. 
Matt Gaetz, one of Trump's most outspoken allies on Capitol Hill. "I take a 
back seat to no member of this body when it comes to defending the president," he 
EFTA00032523
--- PAGE 7 ---
said in a floor speech shortly before the vote. "This resolution offers no criticism of 
the president. It doesn't criticize the president's attacks on Soleimani. As a matter 
of fact, this resolution doesn't even say Soleimani's name in it." 
Gaetz's district includes the naval air station in Pensacola, Fla. "I represent more 
troops than any other member of this body," he said. "I buried one of them earlier 
today at Arlington, and that sergeant died a patriot and a hero. If the members of 
our armed services have the courage to go fight and die in these wars, as 
Congress we ought to have the courage to vote for them or against them. It's 
ludicrous to suggest that we are impairing the troops from doing their job by not 
doing our job articulated in the Constitution." 
The other Republicans who voted for Slotkin's resolution were Rep. Francis 
Rooney (Fla.), who is retiring, and Rep. Tom Massie (Ky.), a libertarian-minded 
iconoclast. 
Two of the eight Democrats who voted against it are freshmen who served in 
the armed forces: Reps. Elaine Luria (Va.) and Max Rose (N.Y.). And Rep. 
Stephanie Murphy (Fla.) was formerly a national security specialist at the Defense 
Department. The others who voted no are moderates from difficult-to-win districts, 
including Ben McAdams (Utah), Anthony Brindisi (N.Y.), Joe Cunningham (S.C.), 
Kendra Horn (Okla.) and Josh Gottheimer (N.J.). 
Trump trashes Adam Schiff during Ohio rally 
-- Trump ripped the Slotkin resolution during a rally last night in Toledo, 
Ohio, insisting he doesn't need to get permission from Congress to protect 
America. "[Soleimani] was a bloodthirsty terrorist ... and he's no longer a terrorist. 
He's dead, and yet now I see ... the radical-left Democrats have expressed outrage 
EFTA00032524
--- PAGE 8 ---
over the termination of this horrible terrorist," the president said. "Instead, they 
should be outraged by Soleimani's savage crimes and the fact that his countless 
victims were denied justice for so long." 
Trump singled out Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), who as the leader of the 
House Intelligence Committee,is a member of the Gang of Eight that's 
entitled to briefings on the nation's biggest secrets. Schiff spearheaded the 
investigation that led to Trump's impeachment for abuse of power and obstruction 
of Congress, and the congressman has clearly gotten under the president's skin. 
"You lithe pencil neck," Trump said, referring to Schiff. Trump claimed, with no 
evidence whatsoever, that Schiff would have called CNN ahead of the drone strike 
on Soleimani to tip them off and that this would have allowed the Quds Force 
commander to get away. "They want us to tell them so that they can leak it to their 
friends in the corrupt media," he said, referring to House Democrats. 
Slotkin's resolution explicitly makes an exception for defending against "an 
imminent armed attack," but Trump ignored this as he complained about 
Democrats trying to stop him from taking action if there's an imminent threat. 
"He was looking very seriously at our embassies and not just the embassy in 
Baghdad, but we stopped him very quickly and we stopped him cold," the president 
told a crowd of nearly 8,000 supporters, referring to Soleimani. "We didn't have 
time to call up Nancy [Pelosi], who is not operating with a full deck." 
QUOTE OF THE DAY: 
"It's not about how bad they are. It's about how good we are," Pelosi said 
at her weekly news conference, referring to Iran and Soleimani. (Felicia

Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) heads to the Senate floor for a vote. (Shawn Thew/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock) 
-- In the Senate, two Republicans have committed to support Kaine's 
resolution: Sens. Mike Lee (Utah) and Rand Paul (Ky.). Kaine is trying to woo 
at least two more GOP colleagues by offering to make amendments that 
could get them on board. He's actively discussing draft text with Sens. Susan 
Collins (Maine) and Todd Young (Ind.). Kaine has already agreed to remove any 
references to Trump by name to make it more palatable for Republican colleagues, 
and he's willing to make more edits. "It doesn't mean everyone I talk to will get on 
board, but me sitting down with them and talking them through why I've done it this 
way, it gives them some level of comfort," Kaine told Jenna Portnoy. 
Kaine vocally pushed to get Congress to authorize the use of military force in the 
Middle East even when his good friend Barack Obama was president. (Read my 
piece about it from 2015 here). In fact, Kaine refused to modulate his position even 
when Hillary Clinton chose him as her running mate. His longtime emphasis on this 
issue undermines the GOP argument that his resolution is politically motivated. 
Keep an eye on Young, who happens to be chairman of the National Republican 
Senatorial Committee. I wrote a Big Idea in May about how Young's military service 
prompted him to focus on this issue when it looked like the United States might get 
drawn into a war with Venezuela. 
"I understand — as a former Marine Corps intelligence officer — the real-world 
limitations to and the sensitivities associated with sharing certain information, even 
with members of Congress," Young told Seung Min Kim, referring to the closed-
door briefing on Wednesday that left Lee and Paul seething. "But I left there feeling 
as though it would've been a lot more helpful had I gotten a little peek into some of 
the intel that informed the operational decisions."

U.S. believes Ukraine airliner shot down by Iran 
THE LATEST ON THE IRAN CRISIS: 
-- In a phone call with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Iraqi Prime Minister 
Adel Abdul Mandi asked the United States to send a delegation to Iraq to set 
up a mechanism for the "safe withdrawal of forces from Iraq." Sarah Dadouch 
reports: "The Iraqi prime minister has repeatedly insisted that U.S. troop withdrawal 
was the only path toward de-escalation. ... According to a statement, Abdul Mandi 
also shared his objections regarding U.S. forces entering Iraq and American 
aircraft flying in Iraqi airspace without the consent of the Iraqi government." 
-- The Trump administration hit Iran with more sanctions Friday in the first 
concrete response to the attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq this week. (Carol 
Morello) 
-- Western officials believe an Iranian missile hit the Ukrainian plane that 
crashed near Tehran earlier this week in a possible unintentional firing. 
Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky is now asking Western leaders to share with 
him the intelligence that suggests this. Isabelle Khurshudyan and Erin 
Cunningham report: "Iran, meanwhile, denied the assertions that the Boeing 737, 
carrying 176 people from Tehran to Kyiv, was shot down early Wednesday shortly 
after departing from Tehran. ... Ukraine has taken an active role in investigating the 
crash of the jet, which was carrying 11 Ukrainians, including the crew. A team of 45 
experts and search-and-rescue personnel from Ukraine, including specialists who 
helped investigate the July 2014 downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over 
Ukrainian territory, arrived in Tehran early Thursday to participate in the probe. ... 
Zelensky had phone conversations Thursday with heads of government from 
Canada, Britain, Sweden and Iran — countries that each had citizens among the 
passengers. While Ukraine's readouts of those calls said Zelensky intended to 
keep the leaders abreast of Ukraine's findings and encouraged their 
EFTA00032527
--- PAGE 11 ---
countries to participate in the investigation, he has now had to publicly ask 
to be briefed in return. ... The Ukrainian leader is expected to speak with 
[Pompeo] on Friday. ... 
"In Washington, U.S. officials expressed 'high confidence' that the Boeing 
737-800 was targeted by an SA-15 surface-to-air missile, part of a Russian-
made air defense system also known as a Tor system, as Iranian forces were on 
high alert. President Trump said the downing of the aircraft was probably a 
'mistake.' Then in Ottawa, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said 
intelligence analyses indicated that a surface-to-air missile hit the plane in what 
could have been an 'unintentional' act. ... A Ukrainian official ... said that Zelensky 
made the public request for evidence about the crash because the United 
States had not yet shared with Ukraine its intelligence about the missile 
Thursday. ... 
"The Washington Post obtained a video that allegedly shows the moment the 
airliner was struck in midair. The video, first published by the New York 
Times, purportedly shows a missile intercepting the aircraft near the city of 
Parand, followed by a loud boom. ... Earlier Friday, the Iranian government said 
in a statement that it was inviting Boeing to send a representative to help examine 
the 'black box' containing the flight data and cockpit voice recorders. Iranian state 
television aired a video of an investigator opening and showing the contents of the 
box." 
-- The tragedy mirrors the 1988 Iran Air incident, in which a passenger plane 
that had originated in the Iranian capital was shot down, leaving 290 
dead. Adam Taylor reports: "On July 3, 1988, Iran Air Flight 655 was shot down by 
the U.S. military. The flight ... was flying over the Strait of Hormuz toward its 
destination, Dubai, when it was hit by two surface-to-air missiles. Though Pentagon 
officials at first denied any knowledge of the incident, it soon emerged that the 
plane had been targeted by the USS Vincennes, a cruiser that had been involved 
in a skirmish with Iranian boats in the Persian Gulf and had mistaken the 
EFTA00032528
--- PAGE 12 ---
passenger jet for an Iranian warplane. President Ronald Reagan expressed 
sympathy for the 'terrible human tragedy' but suggested that the plane had 'failed 
to heed repeated warnings.' However, an investigation by the International Civil 
Aviation Organization, a U.N. agency, found that U.S. military ships in the region 
did not have the equipment necessary to monitor civilian air-traffic-control 
frequencies." 
-- On Fox News last night, Pompeo reiterated that Soleimani planned "a series 
of imminent attacks." Asked for specifics, he added: "We don't know precisely 
when and we don't know precisely where. But it was real." 
-- An Iranian military commander said the missiles fired at bases used by 
U.S. troops in Iraq were not intended to inflict casualties. Kareem Fahim and 
Sarah Dadouch report: "'We did not intend to kill,' said Brig. Gen. Amir Ali 
Hajizadeh, the head of the Revolutionary Guard's Aerospace Force, according to 
Iranian state media. 'We intended to hit the enemy's military machinery.' However, 
he repeated the government's claim that 'tens of people were killed or wounded.' 
U.S. and Iraqi officials said the strikes caused no casualties. ... Iran tried to counter 
the United States on the diplomatic front Thursday after Trump called on Britain, 
Germany, France, Russia and China to 'break away from the remnants' of the 2015 
nuclear deal Iran struck with world powers. ... British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, 
speaking with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Thursday, 'underlined the UK's 
continued commitment to' the nuclear deal and 'ongoing dialogue to avoid nuclear 
proliferation and reduce tensions,' according to a British government statement. 
Rouhani also called European Council President Charles Michel asking for a 
response to U.S. sanctions, which Rouhani described as 'economic terrorism,' the 
Iranian Fars News agency reported. In a statement, Michel emphasized the need 
for de-escalation in the region." 
-- The U.S. strike on Soleimani's convoy last week also killed Abu Mandi al-
Muhandis, the deputy head of an Iraqi paramilitary group, whose death could 
have far-reaching implications. From Middle East Eye: "Commanders of Iranian-
EFTA00032529
--- PAGE 13 ---
backed armed factions in Iraq tell MEE that with the loss of the two leaders, they 
are now almost paralysed and would be unable to strike the Americans with real 
consequence. ... Muhandis, who since the 1980s has been one of America's most 
wanted men over his involvement in the bombing of the US and French embassies 
in Kuwait, was seen by most Iraqis as Iran's most influential man in the country. ... 
Although formally stripped of his financial and administrative powers, Muhandis 
continued to enjoy great influence over most of the Hashd al-Shaabi's armed 
factions, with the government unable to regain control over the paramilitary 
umbrella group or force Muhandis to implement orders for fear of retaliation. ... 
While he frustrated the government, it was Muhandis' strong personality, and his 
blatant challenge to it and the rest of his opponents, that so attracted the leaders 
and fighters of the armed factions and kept them revolving around him like moths 
to a flame, following wherever he went." 
-- The speed at which the Iran crisis unfolded shows the influence Trump's 
new team of national security advisers has. From the Journal: "The group, 
including new Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, new chairman of the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff Mark Milley and new national security adviser Robert O'Brien, along with 
[Pompeo], backed the president's decision to kill the top Iranian military 
commander and moved swiftly to carry it out. The new team was cohesive and less 
inclined than its predecessors to push back against the president's wishes, 
according to administration officials and others consulted by the White House. 
They also were less likely to consult in advance with other administration, 
Pentagon or State Department officials, congressional leaders or foreign allies, 
some of these officials said." 
-- Informants in Iraq and Syria helped the United States kill Soleimani. From 
Reuters: "Soleimani arrived at the Damascus airport in a vehicle with dark-tinted 
glass. ... They parked near a staircase leading to a Cham Wings Airbus A320, 
destined for Baghdad. Neither Soleimani nor the soldiers were registered on the 
passenger manifesto. ... The passenger flight would be Soleimani's last. ... 
EFTA00032530
--- PAGE 14 ---
Investigators have focused on how suspected informants inside the Damascus and 
Baghdad airports collaborated with the U.S. military to help track and pinpoint 
Soleimani's position. ... The suspects include two security staffers at the Baghdad 
airport and two Cham Wings employees. ... The National Security agency's 
investigators believe the four suspects, who have not been arrested, worked as 
part of a wider group of people feeding information to the U.S. military, the official 
said." 
-- For Trump and Iran, Twitter trolling helped escalate tensions on the 
battlefield. David Nakamura reports: "A day after [Trump] signaled he would not 
use military force to escalate a tense standoff with Iran, that nation's supreme 
leader responded with a message of his own: a doctored photo of Trump's face 
imprinted with red welts from a slap to the face. The creation on the official website 
of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei offered a trolling visual meme to echo his previous 
warning that Tehran's missile attack on two Iraqi facilities housing U.S. troops was 
only the first salvo in a campaign to avenge the drone killing of [Soleimani.] 
Experts called the display an example of a new era in international diplomacy in 
which official letters, telephone hotlines and secure video conference calls have 
been replaced, in some cases, by high-octane and instantaneous social media 
messaging." 
-- Notable commentary from The Post's opinion page: 
• Jim Webb, former Democratic senator from Virginia and 
secretary of the Navy under Reagan: "When did it become 
acceptable to kill a top leader of a country we aren't even at war 
with?" 
• Andrew McCabe, former deputy director of the FBI: "If you think 
Iran is done retaliating, think again." 
• Fareed Zakaria: "Trump does not have a foreign policy. He has 
a series of impulses." 
EFTA00032531
--- PAGE 15 ---
• David Ignatius: "This is what a real Iran strategy would look 
like." 
• Eugene Robinson: "The best Iran crisis explanation? Trump's 
obsession with Obama." 
• Josh Rogin: "Soleimani's death offers a chance to fix U.S. policy 
on Syria." 
• Max Boot: "By claiming Democrats support terrorism, 
Republicans hit a new low." 
• A hilarious satire by Alexandra Petri: "Millions of Americans 
devastated to learn they were ardent fans of Soleimani this 
whole time."

Why Democrats say they're withholding the impeachment articles 
DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS THAT SHOULDN'T BE OVERSHADOWED: 
-- Nancy Pelosi signaled this morning in a letter to colleagues that the House 
will transmit the articles of impeachment to the Senate as soon as next week. 
"I have asked Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler to be prepared to bring 
to the Floor next week a resolution to appoint managers and transmit articles of 
impeachment to the Senate," she wrote. (Our live blog has more.) 
EFTA00032532
--- PAGE 16 ---
-- The Senate has conducted 15 impeachment trials in U.S. history. It has 
heard witnesses in every single one. Noah Bookbinder, executive director of 
Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, reviews the history: "Only 19 
other individuals besides Trump have been impeached by the House of 
Representatives. The Senate completed a trial in 15 of those cases, and in every 
single one of them, it heard testimony from witnesses. Those cases include the 
only two prior instances in which a president was impeached." 
-- House Republicans are eyeing a push to condemn Pelosi for delaying the 
trial. From Politico: "GOP Rep. Bradley Byrne, who is running for an Alabama 
Senate seat, introduced a censure resolution on Thursday morning to rebuke 
Pelosi for hanging on to the articles of impeachment since December. Republicans 
have the option to force a floor vote on the measure though Democrats would 
surely move to table it, just as they did with a censure resolution against" Schiff. 
-- Meanwhile, Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) tweeted an impeachment-related 
fundraising appeal that included a doctored photo of Pelosi, drawing a 
retweet from Trump. Felicia Sonmez reports: "The tweet marks the second time 
this week that a House Republican has tweeted a photo that appears to have been 
manipulated. On Monday, Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) tweeted a fake photo of 
Obama with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. ... The tweet shows a close-up, 
red-tinted photo of Pelosi, with the lines in the House speaker's face exaggerated 
due to the image's unnaturally high contrast."

-- An Army general denied a request by an officer pardoned by Trump in an 
open murder case to have his Special Forces tab reinstated. Dan Lamothe 
EFTA00032533
--- PAGE 17 ---
reports: "The decoration for retired Army Maj. Mathew L. Golsteyn was denied Dec. 
by Lt. Gen. Francis M. Beaudette, the commander of U.S. Army Special 
Operations Command, the Army disclosed Thursday. Beaudette's decision is not 
final, and the service said in a statement that it will next have an administrative 
panel consider whether it should reinstate the Special Forces tab and a 
Distinguished Service Cross — the U.S. military's second-highest valor award —
and expunge a letter of reprimand Golsteyn received in connection with his case. 
Golsteyn was awaiting trial this year in the alleged murder of a suspected Taliban 
bombmaker in Marja, Afghanistan, in February 2010. ... The general's denial of 
Golsteyn's reinstatement request follows Trump's decision in November to pardon 
Golsteyn along with former 1st Lt. Clint Lorance, an Army officer who had been 
convicted of murder in Afghanistan. ... Golsteyn, reached for comment Thursday 
evening, said he had not heard about the decision until it was first reported by The 
Washington Post. A few minutes later, he and his lawyer, Phil Stackhouse, said 
they received notification from the Army in an emailed letter that had just arrived." 
-- The Justice Department is winding down the Hillary Clinton-related inquiry 
once championed by Trump. It found nothing of consequence. Devlin Barrett 
and Matt Zapotosky report: "John Huber, the U.S. attorney in Utah, was tapped in 
November 2017 by then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to look into concerns 
raised by Trump and his allies in Congress that the FBI had not fully pursued cases 
of possible corruption at the Clinton Foundation and during Clinton's time as 
secretary of state, when the U.S. government decided not to block the sale of a 
company called Uranium One. As a part of his review, Huber examined documents 
and conferred with federal law enforcement officials in Little Rock who were 
handling a meandering probe into the Clinton Foundation. ... Current and former 
officials said that Huber has largely finished and found nothing worth pursuing —
though the assignment has not formally ended and no official notice has been sent 
to the Justice Department or to lawmakers."

-- Internal Boeing documents show employees discussing efforts to 
manipulate U.S. and international safety regulators. Ian Duncan, Lori Aratani 
and Michael Laris report: "'Yes, I still haven't been forgiven by god for the covering 
up I did last year," said a 2018 message. Another exchange between Boeing 
employees, from August 2015, closes out with this: 'I know but this is what these 
regulators get when they try and get in the way. they impede progress. ...' In 2017, 
a Boeing employee wrote: 'this airplane is designed by clowns, who in turn 
are supervised by monkeys.' The documents were released by Boeing to 
congressional investigators probing how the company's 737 Max jets were certified 
by the Federal Aviation Administration as safe before two crashes that killed 346 
people. ... 
"At issue in some of the messages was whether simulator training should be 
required for pilots flying the Max. Boeing went to great lengths to prevent 
such a requirement, in part because it would be costly for its customers, 
company documents show. ... In one November 2015 message, the 737 chief 
technical pilot, whose name is redacted in the documents, said failing to get 
computer-based training for one system 'is a planet-killer for the MAX.' ... In 
another email chain, from June 2017, the chief technical pilot forwarded to Boeing 
colleagues messages in which he persuaded an airline, which is not identified in 
the documents, not to require simulator training on the Max. 'Looks like my jedi 
mind trick worked again!' the pilot wrote. 'These are not the droids you're looking 
for.' ... In a shift Tuesday, the company said that it is recommending that pilots 
undergo simulator training before they resume flying the 737 Max. The FAA, which 
will have the final say, said it will consider Boeing's recommendation." (Read the 
Boeing documents for yourself here.) 
-- The United States economy added 145,000 jobs in December as the 
unemployment rate remained at 3.5 percent. (Rachel Siegel) 
-- Video from Jeffrey Epstein's first apparent suicide attempt was lost due to 
"technical errors," according to prosecutors. Reis Thebault reports: "Federal 
EFTA00032535
--- PAGE 19 ---
prosecutors said in December they were unable to locate the video, which would 
have showed guards finding Epstein after his first apparent suicide attempt in July. 
Then, just a day later, they wrote in a court filing that they had found the footage 
and were 'in the process of obtaining a copy' from the Metropolitan Correctional 
Center in New York City, where Epstein was held. But on Thursday, prosecutors 
reversed themselves again, saying the video 'no longer exists' because of 
'technical errors.' Jail officials initially thought they had saved footage from outside 
Epstein's cell, when in fact the footage they preserved was from a different part of 
the facility, explained Assistant U.S. Attorneys 
and Jason 
Swergold in the latest filing." 
-- Border crossings are starting to plateau as U.S. officials report a continued 
decline in immigration apprehensions. Abigail Hauslohner reports: "The number 
of people apprehended or deemed 'inadmissible' by U.S. border authorities along 
the southern border fell to 40,620 last month, down 72 percent from May, when the 
Trump administration declared it was at the height of a border crisis. December 
marked the seventh straight month of decline in border crossings, but the month-
to-month differences have shrunk significantly since September. Border 
enforcement actions last month were roughly on par with December 2017." 
-- Counties, cities and states are stepping up on their climate goals as the 
Trump administration steps back. Rebecca Tan reports: "Maryland's most 
populous jurisdiction is promising an ambitious package of new climate initiatives in 
2020, joining other liberal counties, cities and states stepping up to address what 
they see as the Trump administration's resistance to protecting the planet. ... In 
February, Montgomery will hold a town hall on hundreds of recommendations from 
climate workgroups convened last year by County Executive Marc Elrich (D). And 
by early 2021, officials hope to unveil a comprehensive plan detailing how the 
county will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent by 2027 and 100 
percent by 2035."

THE NEW WORLD ORDER: 
-- Gag rule alert: The International Olympic Committee warned athletes they 
would face sanctions, which could include the loss of medals, for 
participating in political protests during the Olympics in Tokyo this summer, 
including kneeling, political hand gestures and wearing or holding signs or 
armbands. Jacob Bogage reports: "The committee published a three-page 
document of guidelines. ... 'We needed clarity, and they wanted clarity on the 
rules,' [said] Kirsty Coventry of Zimbabwe, chair of the IOC Athletes' Commission, 
which helped create the new document. ... The guidelines outlaw demonstrations 
such as those staged by Tommie Smith and John Carlos, American sprinters who 
raised their gloved fists on the medal stand at the 1968 Games in Mexico City, and 
former NFL player Colin Kaepernick, who in 2016 began kneeling during the 
national anthem. Both demonstrations sought to draw attention to racial injustice 
and have been repeated by other athletes in recent years. ... 
"Ethiopian runner Feyisa Lilesa crossed his wrists at the finish line of the 
men's marathon at the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro to show support for 
civil rights protesters in his home country. Americans Race Imboden, a fencer, 
and hammer-thrower Gwen Berry were placed on probation by the U.S. Olympic 
and Paralympic Committee in August after demonstrating on the medal stand at 
the Pan American Games. Imboden knelt during the national anthem, while Berry 
raised a fist. Athletes who protest will face discipline 'on a case-by-case basis as 
necessary,' according to the guidelines."

-- A billion animals have been caught in Australia's fires. Some may go 
extinct. Karin Brulliard and Darryl Fears report: "The mouse-size dunnart is not as 
iconic as the koalas or platypuses that draw tourists, but it is arguably the most 
special mammal on Australia's Kangaroo Island. Now the Kangaroo Island 
dunnart's days may be numbered. Before bush fires struck, it was already 
endangered, so rare that even researchers who studied them had never seen one. 
Now they fear they never will. One-third of the 1,700-square-mile island has 
burned, including the entire area where these dunnarts are known to live. ... More 
than 1 billion mammals, birds and reptiles nationwide — some of them found 
nowhere else on Earth — may have been affected or killed by the fires sweeping 
across Australia, according to a University of Sydney estimate. The potential toll is 
far greater when other types of animals are included. ... Individual animals might 
survive, but when their habitat is gone, 'it doesn't matter,' Saunders said. 'They'll 
die anyway.'" 
-- Disgusting: Hoaxers are using the fires to spread misinformation and 
profit, Brittany Shammas reports. 
-- The fire crisis is fueling protests calling for bolder action on climate 
change. Kate Shuttleworth reports: "At rallies nationwide on Friday, thousands 
called for Prime Minister Scott Morrison to resign over what they say is his 
administration's passivity on an issue that has hit home to millions of Australians as 
a clear and present danger. The conservative leader has defended his disaster 
response after facing criticism from victims and firefighters for its perceived 
inadequacy. In Melbourne, close to 10,000 people took to the streets, spurning 
calls from police and the state's center-left leader, Daniel Andrews, not to risk 
diverting emergency resources. ... An organizer of a similar rally in Sydney, Gavin 
Stanbrook, said the events of recent weeks revealed a nation polarized over how 
to tackle the challenge. 'We are divided between coal interests and politicians on 
the one side and then firefighters and volunteers on the other and the rest of us 
who are either impacted or our friends and family are on the front line, or in cities 
EFTA00032538
--- PAGE 22 ---
surrounded by smoke,' Stanbrook said. 'We need to come together and say that 
we will not accept it anymore.'" 
-- Suspected Islamist militants killed 25 soldiers in Niger. Danielle Paquette 
reports: "The clash unfolded in the western village of Chinegodar near the border 
with Mali, according to Nigerien defense officials, as fighters with ties to the Islamic 
State and al-Qaeda look to seize new swaths of territory. The bloodshed came 
about a month after gunmen ambushed a Nigerien army post in another border 
town, killing 71 soldiers in the deadliest strike on the nation's forces in recent 
memory. The Islamic State West Africa Province asserted responsibility for that 
massacre two days later." 
-- In Israel, deadly floods have kept residents confined to their homes and 
offices even as they braced for potential spinoff attacks from rising tensions 
between the United States and Iran. Steve Hendrix reports: "Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday beseeched citizens to take flood warnings as 
seriously as they do the sirens warning of imminent rocket fire that are a feature of 
life in many Israeli communities. ... Netanyahu also warned the adventurous not to 
venture out to the desert to witness the dramatic — and potentially dangerous —
spectacle of dry stream beds reanimated with roaring water. 'Watch them on 
television,' he advised. ... Officials said rescue resources had been redeployed 
nationwide in response to the flooding, which stretched from the coastal plains 
along the Mediterranean to the occupied West Bank down to the Dead Sea." 
-- China identified a new strain of coronavirus as the source of its 
pneumonia outbreak. Gerry Shih and Lena H. Sun report: "A group of Chinese 
experts this week isolated and obtained the genome sequence of the new virus, 
which is believed to be responsible for sickening dozens of people who visited a 
wild-animal market last month in Wuhan, in central China, state media reported 
Thursday. The outbreak ahead of the Lunar New Year travel season in China has 
prompted health authorities across East Asia to increase screening of travelers for 
signs of fever, underscoring fears about its potential spread."

-- Understatement of the year? Pope Francis said 2020 is off to a rough start, 
saying it "does not seem to be marked by encouraging signs." Chico Harlan 
reports: "While saying that maintaining hope is essential, the pope spent the next 
minutes talking about wars and could-be wars, exploitation, sexual abuse, 
Internet hate speech, international indifference to humanitarian crises, and the 
depressing state of the world's fight against climate change. He called heightened 
tensions between the United States and Iran 'particularly troubling,' but his remarks 
amounted to a laundry list of flash points, both major and obscure, from Burkina 
Faso to Venezuela to Australia. 'Certainly, hope has to be realistic,' Francis said. 'It 
demands acknowledging the many troubling issues confronting our world and the 
challenges lurking on the horizon. It requires that problems be called by their name 
and the courage be found to resolve them." 
-- Lebanon has banned ex-Nissan chief Carlos Ghosn from traveling. Sarah 
Dadouch reports: "Ghosn appeared at a hearing in Lebanon on Thursday, two days 
after Lebanon's caretaker justice minister, Albert Serhan, said the country's public 
prosecutor had received the Interpol red notice about Ghosn and would be taking 
the necessary steps. He was placed under house arrest. A few days after his 
arrival in Lebanon's capital, Ghosn found himself in more legal trouble: A group of 
lawyers last Thursday lodged a legal complaint against him for visiting Israel as 
chairman of Renault and later Nissan. Lebanon and Israel have been in a state of 
war for the past six decades, and Lebanese law considers interacting with the 
country's southern neighbor and sworn enemy a crime. Ali Abbas, one of the two 
lawyers who filed the Israel-related complaint against Ghosn, said the travel ban 
was a formality that usually comes after receiving Interpol notices, especially red 
notices, which alert police about internationally wanted fugitives but do not compel 
any country to arrest the fugitive."

-- A statue mocking Trump in Melania Trump's home country was burned 
down. Lateshia Beachum reports: "Firefighters in Moravce, a city in central 
Slovenia, tried to extinguish the bonfire, but their efforts left charred planks on the 
ground. The arsonists responsible for the Christmas nutcracker-like statue's ashes 
are reportedly still at large. The nearly 26-foot tall wooden structure that had a 
mechanism to open Trump's red painted mouth full of pointy teeth was constructed 
last year in a nation divided over the U.S. president. The statue of Trump, with the 
president's signature blue suit and red tie, had been under torch threats since local 
residents threatened to set it ablaze on Halloween ... It was relocated because of 
the risk." 
-- London's Madame Tussauds removed its wax figures of Prince Harry and 
Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, from its display of Britain's royal family less 
than 24 hours after the couple announced they would be "stepping back" 
from their roles as senior royals. Jennifer Hassan reports: "The figures will no 
longer stand alongside the rest of the royal family. They have been moved by the 
wax museum's staff. The likenesses of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, 
William and Catherine, remain on display alongside figures of Queen Elizabeth II 
and her husband, Prince Philip. 'As two of our most popular and well-loved figures, 
they will of course remain an important feature at Madame Tussauds London as 
we watch to see what the next chapter holds for them,' said [Steve Davies, general 
manager of Madame Tussauds London]."

2020 WATCH: 
-- Jared Kushner's global role is shrinking as his role in the president's 
reelection campaign grows. From Annie Karni and Maggie Haberman in the 
Times: "When senior administration officials gathered in the Situation Room on 
Tuesday for a meeting to discuss the repercussions of the killing of [Soleimani], the 
White House aide whose portfolio is the Middle East was notably absent from the 
meeting. ... [He] was sitting for a photo shoot for a planned Time magazine cover 
story. ... [Kushner] is positioning himself to be the overseer of something of even 
greater personal interest to his father-in-law: Mr. Trump's 2020 re-election 
campaign. ... [Kushner] sees no reason to involve himself as extensively in 
international issues now that the State Department is run by [Mike] Pompeo, whom 
he sees as far more competent than his predecessor, Rex W. Tillerson." 
-- Mike Bloomberg won't release the women who sued him from their 
nondisclosure agreements. From ABC News: "'You can't just walk away from it,' 
Bloomberg said. 'They're legal agreements, and for all I know the other side 
wouldn't want to get out of it.' Last month, ABC News reported on several lawsuits 
in which Bloomberg was accused of making crude remarks in the 1990s and 
of allegedly fostering an uncomfortable environment for women to work —
allegations Bloomberg has denied. Three cases against the company remain 
active. ABC News has spoken with several women who expressed interest in 
telling their stories who were subject to confidentiality agreements, but said they 
feared the prospect of facing retribution from the company for speaking out." 
-- Tom Steyer appears to have qualified for the seventh Democratic debate, 
scheduled for next Tuesday night in Iowa, on the strength of Fox News polls 
that found him with double-digit support in Nevada and South Carolina. David 
Weigel reports: "Steyer, who has spent more than $115 million on his campaign so 
far, hit 12 percent in the network's poll of Nevada ... and 15 percent in South 
Carolina. ... It came after Steyer poured more than $20 million into commercials 
and other advertising in these states as of this week, with $11.2 million worth of 
EFTA00032542
--- PAGE 26 ---
expenditures in South Carolina and $10.3 million in Nevada. He has also spent 
heavily to attract hundreds of thousands of small-dollar donations, which the DNC 
requires for debate access." 
-- The Fox News Nevada poll also shows Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders 
vying for the lead in the state: "Biden tops Sanders by 23-17 percent among 
Democratic caucusgoers, with both down one percentage point since November. 
[Elizabeth] Warren comes in at 12 percent, down from 18 percent — and ties with 
[Steyer] for third." 
-- A new Monmouth Poll shows a four-way fight in the New Hampshire 
Democratic primary: "Among registered New Hampshire Democrats and 
unaffiliated voters who are likely to participate in the February 2020 Democratic 
primary, 20% currently support [Pete] Buttigieg, 19% back Biden, 18% back 
Sanders, and 15% back Warren. ... Compared to Monmouth's last New Hampshire 
poll in September, Buttigieg's support has grown by 10 points (from 10%) and 
Sanders' support has increased by 6 points (from 12%). Warren's support has 
dropped by 12 points (from 27%) and Biden's has decreased by 6 points (from 
25%)." 
-- Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti endorsed Biden. From the Los Angeles 
Times: "Garcetti will be one of Biden's highest-profile supporters in California's 
March 3 primary, but the endorsement is unlikely to have any practical effect on the 
highly competitive race. Dianne Feinstein, the state's senior U.S. senator, is also 
supporting Biden. And Long Beach Mayor Robert Garcia, who had endorsed 
California Sen. Kamala Harris before she dropped out of the presidential race, also 
announced his support for Biden on Thursday." 
-- Fun read: Philadelphians looking for love on Tinder may have come across 
"Daddy Bernie," a profile set up for Sanders by a local man who just wants to 
inform people on the dating app about his favorite candidate. From the 
Philadelphia Inquirer: "Alex Scheinberg, 26, is not a senator from Vermont. Or any 
EFTA00032543
--- PAGE 27 ---

But, Scheinberg said, that gives him more time to mix politics and pleasure in order 
to promote his favorite candidate in a forum that's increasingly becoming a venue 
for political endorsement and engagement. ... Scheinberg has his Tinder profile set 
to see all genders and sexual orientations, though he is straight. This way, he said, 
he can maximize the number of people seeing Sanders' campaign message. 
That's the same reason he swipes right on almost everyone, to reach as many 
people as possible. (For those who don't have to experience the horror show that 
is modern online dating, swiping right on a profile means you're interested. Swiping 
left, not so much.)"

United States Attorney 
Southern District of New York 
United States Courthouse 
300 Quarropas Sower 
White Plains. New York 1060! 
January 8, 2020 
BY ECF 
The Honorable Kenneth M. Karas 
United States District Judge 
Southern District of New York 
300 Quarropas Street 
White Plains, NY 10601 
Re: 
United States v. Nicholas Tartaglione, S4 16 Cr. 832 (KMK) 
Dear Judge Karas: 
The Government respectfully submits this letter to provide a further update to the Court 
regarding the defense's request for video footage from outside the defendant's cell at the 
Metropolitan Correctional Center ("MCC") on July 22 — July 23, 2019 (the "Requested Video"). 
On or about December 19, 2019, the Government informed the Court and defense counsel that it 
had confirmed with MCC staff that the Requested Video had been preserved, and that the 
Government was working to obtain a copy from MCC. As set forth in greater detail below, the 
Government has learned that the MCC inadvertently preserved video from the wrong tier within 
the MCC, and, as a result, video from outside the defendant's cell on July 22 — 23, 2019 no longer 
exists. 
On or about July 23, 2019, at approximately 1:27 a.m., MCC corrections officers responded 
to the cell ("Cell-1") that the defendant shared with Jeffrey Epstein. On or about July 25, 2019, 
defense counsel requested that MCC preserve video footage from outside the defendant's cell from 
July 22, 2019 at 11:00 p.m. through July 23, 2019 at 4:00 a.m. From speaking with MCC legal 
counsel, the Government understands that in response to this request, MCC legal counsel looked 
up the defendant's cell in the MCC computer system and thereafter requested that MCC staff 
preserve video from outside of the cell for the requested time period. An MCC staff member 
confirmed that the video had been preserved. 
On or about January 3, 2020, the Government obtained a copy of the Requested Video 
from the MCC, and converted it into a playable format. After reviewing the video, it appeared to 
the Government that the footage contained on the Requested Video was for the correct date and 
time, but captured a different tier than the one where Cell-1 was located because the Requested 
Video did not show corrections officers responding to any of the cells seen on the video. After 
speaking with MCC legal counsel, the Government understands that the MCC computer system 
incorrectly listed the defendant's cell for the time period in question ("Cell-2"). Therefore, when 
EFTA00032547
--- PAGE 2 ---
January 8, 2020 
Page 2 of 2 
MCC legal counsel asked that the video outside of the defendant's cell be preserved, the MCC 
preserved video outside of Cell-2 instead of Cell-1. 
The Government understands from speaking with MCC legal counsel that there was a 
backup system in place that housed all video for the Special Housing Unit, including the Requested 
Video. The Government further understands from the Federal Bureau of Investigation that it has 
reviewed that backup system as part of an unrelated investigation and determined that the 
Requested Video no longer exists on the backup system and has not since at least August 2019. 
The Government will make the video of the tier containing Cell-2 available for defense 
counsel's review at the United States Attorney's Office. 
Respectfully submitted,

Renowned Claims Resolution Experts Announce Commencement of the 
Epstein Victims' Compensation Program 
New York, NY — Today, individuals who were sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein may begin the 
process of filing claims with the Epstein Victims' Compensation Program ("Epstein VCP" or 
"Program"). The Epstein VCP is a voluntary, non-adversarial, confidential claims resolution program 
that has been established to compensate victims-survivors and resolve their sexual abuse claims 
against Jeffrey Epstein and the Epstein Estate. The Epstein VCP will operate entirely independently 
of the Epstein Estate. 
The Program was designed over the last several months by nationally recognized independent 
claims administration experts Kenneth R. Feinberg, Camille S. Biros and Jordana ("Jordy") H. 
Feldman ("Co-Designers") with input from attorneys representing over 70 victims, the Attorney 
General of the Virgin Islands, the Epstein Estate and other interested parties. The Program will be 
administered by Ms. Feldman (the "Administrator"), the former Deputy Special Master of the 
September 11th Victim Compensation Fund, the litigation-alternative program administered by the 
U.S. Department of Justice that compensates victims who have become sick or died as a result of 
their September 11th-related exposure. 
"This Program provides victims of Jeffrey Epstein the opportunity to be heard outside the glare of 
public courtroom proceedings, and to receive acknowledgment by an independent third party as to 
the legitimacy of their experience and the long-term suffering it has wrought," said Ms. Feldman. 
"Treating victims with dignity and respect and providing them with appropriate compensation is 
central to our work with the Program, even as we recognize that no amount of money will erase the 
years of pain these victims have endured." 
"These programs are as much about offering validation as providing fair compensation," said Mr. 
Feinberg who, along with Ms. Biros, has designed and administered similar compensation programs 
for the Catholic Church sexual abuse claims, the Penn State sexual abuse claims, and the 
September 11th Victim Compensation Fund, among others. 
The Program provides victims with an attractive alternative to litigation by offering a process that is 
speedy and cost-effective. The Program also removes barriers to pursue claims in civil courts, 
EFTA00032569
--- PAGE 2 ---
including statutes of limitations and prior settlements, and applies more relaxed evidentiary 
requirements. 
Important features of the Program include: 
1. The Program is independent of and entirely free from any interference or control by 
the Epstein Estate. The Administrator has complete autonomy and decision-making 
authority to determine individual claimant eligibility and compensation. The Estate has no 
authority to modify or reject the Administrator's decisions on any basis or as to any claim, 
and the Estate will pay all eligible claims based on the Administrator's determination. 
2. The Program is purely voluntary; no individual claimant is required to participate. A 
victim's legal rights are not impacted unless the victim accepts the compensation offered by 
the Administrator and signs a release, agreeing not to engage in any further litigation against 
the Epstein Estate and related entities and/or individuals. 
3. The Program is confidential. Protecting Claimant privacy is of paramount importance to 
the Program. The Program will maintain strict confidentiality of all information submitted, but 
will not impose any limitations on the Claimant's ability to share information with law 
enforcement, or anyone else. 
"Our work with victims of Catholic Church abuse, September 11th and other similar programs has 
provided us with invaluable insight into how to calculate the incalculable, and take into account the 
life-long effects of trauma," said Ms. Biros, who co-designed the Program. Mr. Feinberg added, 
"The role of the Administrator is to apply a certain level of objectivity while taking into account the 
specific circumstances presented by each individual claim. It is a challenging task, but one that 
Jordy is uniquely qualified to undertake. Her empathetic and judicious style, and her long-time 
claims experience and service to victims in the 9/11 community will serve this Program and 
Epstein's victims well." 
Beginning today, the Administrator will provide a Claim Form and other relevant Program information 
to individuals who have filed a lawsuit, legal action or claim of sexual abuse against Jeffrey Epstein 
and/or the Estate may begin the process of filing a claim with the Program, or have otherwise been 
identified by counsel. Other individuals may also be eligible to participate in the Program by 
registering on the Program website. The claims filing period will run through March 25, 2021. 
The Program was initially proposed to the Probate Court of the U.S. Virgin Islands ("Probate Court") 
on November 14, 2019. The Co-Designers solicited feedback from various interested parties, 
including victims' counsel, and that feedback was incorporated into a draft protocol that was 
presented to the Probate Court on February 4, 2020. The final protocol was approved by the 
Probate Court on June 3, 2020. 
"We are pleased to get this Program up and running after months of considered and collaborative 
design. My staff is deeply sensitive to the unique circumstances involved and is committed to 
processing the victims' claims in a prompt, fair and effective manner," said Ms. Feldman.

I hope this provides further clarity. 
>>> 
For the "Hot List" (or the high risk list), it is dated August 30, 2019, which is after the events in question. Do you 
have these from the period of June 26, 2019 through August 10, 2019? The hot list file provided begins with 
the AUG 30 list. If you scroll down, you'll find previous lists going back to the beginning of July 2019. The 
list is updated and re-distributed anytime someone is added or removed from the list. The inmate of 
interest here was never placed on the hot list. 
You are still working on getting us the following: 
o Finalized versions of Program Statements 5511.08 and 5500.13; 
o An updated suicide prevention PowerPoint presentation; and 
o Watch call tracking sheets Yes to all of this. 
Finally, with respect to our request for all SROs during the time of 
assignment to the SHU, that seems 
excessively burdensome. Rather, if possible, can you locate the SROs related to Epstein only? The head of the 
records department at MCC, who is Case Management Coordinator Schnahider Demosthenes reported the 
central file for Epstein was taken by the FBI following the inmate's death. I've asked him to double check 
that just to make sure and I'll let you know if anything changes. If the file was taken, any SROs would have 
been included in that file and are no longer accessible to us. 
a Is there something called a "SHU report" that is different from an SRO? Yes, I'm trying to see if MCC 
maintains old copies of these. Much like the LTs logs, in previous institutions I've worked at, these 
were filed for one year but I don't know the practice at MCC. I do believe there is a copy of the last 
one that Epstein appeared on that I will try to track down. The SHU report is a document that 
contains the name and photo of each inmate in the SHU at a given time. The report also contains 
comments specific to each inmate by a number of different departments. As with the other things 
I'm waiting on, I'll send what I'm able to dig up as soon as I find it.

Subject: Re: FW: Requests 
All, 
I hope my responses below serve to clear up some of the issues you had with the documentation that was provided. I 
continue to work to obtain the missing items and will send them as I receive any additional documents. Please let me 
know if you have further questions and I'll be happy to address anything that is still unclear. 
Many of the requests made, such as ICT agenda, cellmate policies and SHU policies are not one-stop-shops. 
These issues are covered in a number of different policies, therefore I tried to include all policies that 
reference those topics. 
1. We received unsigned Word versions of Program Statements 5511.08 and 5500.13. Are there finalized versions? 
Executive Assistant Lee Plourde handles the finalizing of the supplements. He's on leave and will 
address this upon his return on Monday, June 29, 2020. 
2. Why were we given the BOP Correctional Services Procedures Manual? Which of our requests is this responsive 
to? Section 310 of this policy covers inmate accountability in the SHU. You requested 5511.08 and 
this section in the CSPM overlaps some of those same policies. 
3. Why were we given the BOP Suicide Prevention Program Statement? Which of our requests is this responsive to? 
This policy covers staff training requirements for ICT and Quarterly SHU training. I included the 
policy because it directly correlated with other requests. 
4. We were also given a Powerpoint entitled Suicide Prevention for Inmates. Which of our requests is this responsive 
to? When is this document from? The slide show is the Psychology portion of the SHU Training you 
requested. It is dated 1/2/2014. I have requested an updated version that would have been used 
more closely to the time of 
assignment to SHU. I'm just waiting for Psychology staff to 
provide me whatever it is they used at that time. 
5. We were provided a document titled Introduction to Correctional Techniques from January 2020. Which of our 
requests is this responsive to? Is it the MCC institutional familiarization training outline? If so, we would request 
one from a time when the defendants were actively employed at MCC (so before August 2019). This is the 
Institutional Familiarization (IF) outline you requested. It hasn't been called IF for a few years. It 
is now Introduction to Correctional Techniques (ICT). An earlier version is attached here. 
6. We were provided with an undated slide presentation about the MCC SHU. Which of our requests is this 
responsive to? When is this document from? The slide show was created 1/2/2014 as a part of 
quarterly SHU training. The quarterly SHU training is primarily conducted through the BOP's online 
training platform that is a self-guided course that covers a number of topics related to SHU. The 
official SHU training course is not something I can send or save due to the nature of the course 
being automated by the training platform and not a hard file. 
7. The BOP Code of Ethics is highlighted below. Which document is this? Program Statement 3420.11 is the 
Standards of Employee Conduct, which covers the dos and don'ts of employment in the BOP. I've 
attached the DO) Ethics Handbook here. If there is something specific you're looking for, please let 
me know. 
8. We received digital lieutenant's logs. Is there also a hard copy book? There is no hard copy book of these 
logs. The logs are saved to a shared folder at the end of each shift. Although I have worked at 
places that print each log, the Lieutenant's here at NYM reported that that is not the practice here. 
The LTs here email their logs to the executive staff at the conclusion of each 24 hour period for 
review purposes. Thus, eliminating a hard copy record system. 
9. We were provided with a document called "SHU Logs MW" and a document called "SHU Logs." Can we confirm 
what these are? Our requests were for SHU Watch Call Logs and SHU Control Center Logs. Those are the 
digital log books from SHU for the Evening and Morning Watch shifts during the requested time 
period. I am working on obtaining the actual Watch Call tracking sheets from the main Control 
Center at MCC which is something different. However, the officer should be logging their watch 
calls into the digital log book every 30 minutes between 6a — 6p each day. 
EFTA00032573
--- PAGE 3 ---
10. Which document contains the BOP and MCC policy on SHU quarterly training, which is highlighted below as 
having been provided? PS 5270.11 as well as the Suicide Prevention policy covers the SHU quarterly 
training requirement. There is not a separate policy for that. 
11. We asked for P.S. 5270.10, but got P.S. 5270.11. Was P.S. 5270.10 provided to us in error? Or was our request 
incorrect? 5270.10 does not exist. 5270.11 is the policy covering SHU. 
12. Which document contains the BOP and MCC policy on cellmates? I am not aware of any such policy and 
have struggled to find even a mention of it in the policies I've reviewed. I will continue to search 
for a policy that references cellmate assignments. 
13. In the second email, there is a document called "Hot Lists" dated August 30, 2019. Which of our requests is this 
responsive to? The "Hot List" is the high risk list. Any inmate on that list who goes to SHU requires 
immediate notification to Psychology. This is the only "high risk" list the BOP has and I provided it 
in response to your
 uest for "All High Risk Lists reviewed during weekly SHU meetings..." 
14. In the second email, 
mentioned that most of the control center paperwork was seized by FBI and/or 01G. 
Do you or FBI have that paperwork? Has it been provided to us? 
15. Finally, what is the status of the remaining requests? As I continue to work from home, I have not 
personally been able to physically search for the Watch Call sheets. As I previously mentioned, 
those logs were reportedly seized early on in this investigation. I continue to follow up on this. 
With regard to the SROs, those reviews are only electronically available for inmates who are 
currently in SHU and only for the period of their most recent admission to SHU. SROs, assuming 
they were completed, would then be printed and filed in the inmate's central file. I am currently 
trying to figure out where Epstein's file is to see if any SROs are in it. If you really want ALL SROs 
for the period of 
assignment to SHU, that will be an extremely lengthy process of tracking 
down inmate files, many of whom have released from the BOP or been transferred to any number 
of institutions across the country, and then requesting any SROs from the specified period of time 
that are contained in those files be scanned to us. I'm guessing Epstein's file was taken along with 
all of the other documentation shortly after his death, but I have not confirmed that yet.

Hey PCU — As you likely may have seen/heard at this point, last evening, we arrested Jeffrey Epstein on sex trafficking 
charges. Epstein is in custody and will be presented and arraigned on an Indictment that will be unsealed tomorrow 
morning. 
The case is an incredibly important one — not only is the conduct extremely serious and deeply disturbing — but our 
charges ensure that dozens if not more of Epstein's victims, girls who were as young as 14 at the time they were abused, 
will finally have their day in court. It is an extraordinarily worthy prosecution and just the latest example of how this 
unit will never shy away from bringing tough cases against powerful people who have committed grievous crimes. 
Please join me and 
in extending a very well-deserved congratulations to the team, 
who have worked tirelessly to make this case happen (and happen so quickly). They have done us all proud, and if you 
are free, we hope you join us for the press conference formally announcing the charges, which should happen Monday 
morning at 11.

Dear 
It has been a long time since we were here in

my thoughts. I hope that you are all well. I am so grateful we managed to speak despite the 
pandemic — thank you for travelling to see me. I hose that ou received the additional 
information sent to you a while ago 
Please can someone let me know if it is possible to listen in on the trial or get daily 
transcripts? No one has been in touch with me since we spoke. My understanding was that 
victims would be kept informed of events? Please can you tell me who I contact? 
I specifically wanted to let you know that

set the record straight. 
Something that struck a chord with me was written by the author Chimanda Ngozi Adichie: 
'In this age of social media, where a story travels the world in minutes, silence sometimes 
means that other people can hijack your story and soon, their false version becomes the 
defining story about you. The assumption of good faith is dead.....

N-
Here is the budget for the focus group, pretrial juror questionnaire, and feedback on the opening statement and closing 
argument. 
The proposal does not assume we would review and grade the completed juror questionnaires. As I noted in the 
proposal, the cost is approximately $8,000 per 100 questionnaires as we can grade only 5 or 6 an hour. We have not 
provided this service in recent cases, e.g., Silver and Skelos. However, we have provided it in earlier cases, e.g., Martha 
Stewart, where we were also present in court during jury selection. 
I am suggesting we hold the focus group on Friday, October 1, subject to consensus among the team. I can be available on 
other dates as necessary. 
Let me know what questions you have.

Just confirmed with 
that we'll need a replacement of the folder called "18 1-14" since it won't copy for him either, 
probably due to the files getting corrupted somehow when the disc was burned. The folder/its contents may be small 
enough that the FBI could send it via USAfx rather than having to burn a new disc, but we'll need a replacement of this 
folder either way.

Four of the five folders from the disc have successfully uploaded to the folder path linked below, but the fifth folder (18 1-
14) contains at least one file that will not copy off of the disc (not sure if the file is corrupted or what the issue is exactly). 
I'll check with the IT folks and 
to see if they're able to copy the remaining folder off the disc or if we'll need the FBI 
to recopy and resend it. I will keep you posted on the status of this last folder. 
Thanks,

H= and M, 
On Friday, the FBI brought me a CD containing additional files that I need to review for Maxwell. It should be sitting in my 
office on the 4th floor on my keyboard at my desk. Would one of you (or another paralegal who is in the office) be able to 
please grab the CD and load its contents onto the Epstein share? You can save everything from the CD here:

Subject: Proposed Budget -- USA v. Maxwell 
Here is the budget for the focus group, pretrial juror questionnaire, and feedback on the opening statement and closing 
argument. 
The proposal does not assume we would review and grade the completed juror questionnaires. As I noted in the 
proposal, the cost is approximately $8,000 per 100 questionnaires as we can grade only 5 or 6 an hour. We have not 
provided this service in recent cases, e.g., Silver and Skelos. However, we have provided it in earlier cases, e.g., Martha 
Stewart, where we were also present in court during jury selection. 
I am suggesting we hold the focus group on Friday, October 1, subject to consensus among the team. I can be available on 
other dates as necessary. 
Let me know what questions you have.

Hi 
Judge Nathan just issued the attached order setting a number of new dates for the Maxwell trial. Would you be able to 
prepare a new victim notification letter alerting victims to these dates, please? 
And thank you SO MUCH for your amazing efforts getting 
and her family up to New York. The trip was very 
helpful of us and a success overall, so we all feel much better about getting 
and 
up here again for the 
trial.

Subject: AJN Opinion on Maxwell Motions 
Date: Fri, 16 Apr 2021 21:48:09 +0000 
Attachments: Maxwell_Opinion_MTD.pdf 
AJN's opinion with respect to the majority of Maxwell's pretrial motions is attached. She granted Maxwell's motion to 
sever the perjury counts but denied the remaining motions, except for the suppression motions with respect to the Boies 
Schiller materials, which she punted on. 
There is some mildly positive language in here about our discovery approach in this case, and she notes that our pretrial 
disclosure schedule is generally reasonable and will allow Maxwell to prepare for trial in July (which hopefully bodes well 
for the trial adjournment motion).

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
United States of America, 
—v—
Ghislaine Maxwell, 
Defendant.

DOCUMENT 
ELECTRONICALLY FILED 
DOC 0: 
DATE FILED: 4/16/21 
20-CR-330 (MN) 
ORDER 
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
On March 15, 2021, the Defendant filed under seal her reply briefs to the Government 
memorandum of law opposing Defendants' twelve pre-trial motions. She filed the briefs, along 
with the corresponding exhibits, temporarily under seal in order to permit the Government and 
the Court to review certain proposed redactions. Of the twelve reply briefs, Reply Briefs 2, 4, 7, 
8, 9, 11, and 12 did not contain any redaction or sealing requests. Reply Briefs 1, 3, 5, 6, and 10 
contain limited proposed redactions. Reply Briefs 3, 6, and 10 also contain exhibits that the 
Defendant proposes be filed under seal. 
As set forth in the Defendant's cover letter, the premise of the proposed redactions is that 
the materials were produced in discovery and subject to the protective order that has been 
entered in this case. The mere existence of a confidentiality agreement or a protective order 
covering judicial documents is insufficient to overcome the presumption of access. See Aioi 
Nissay Dowa Ins. Co. v. Prosight Specialty Mgrnt. Co., Inc., 12-cv-3274 (JPO), 2012 WL 
3583176, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 21, 2012). And the Court did not receive specific requests or 
justifications to redact or seal any of the materials. 
EFTA00032667

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 205 Filed 04/16/21 Page 2 of 2 
The Defendant is ORDERED to docket Reply Briefs 2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, and 12 on ECF 
today, as she did not propose any redactions to these and the Government has not voiced any 
opposition to these being filed without redactions. 
If either side is seeking these or any other redactions to the remaining reply briefs, they 
must file a letter indicating the redactions they request and providing specific justifications for 
the sealing requests or redactions, in line with the principles set forth in Lugosch. By April 20, 
2021, the parties shall confer and submit a letter informing the Court whether any redactions are 
being sought. If no redactions are being sought, the Defendant is ORDERED to docket the 
remaining reply briefs on ECF by April 20, 2021. 
SO ORDERED.

Chris, 
I am going to be tied up for a bit the morning on the 12th. Would it work on your end to meet at the warehouse at 11am, 
please? The warehouse will be open until 4:30pm, though I'm told I can request additional time in advance if you think 
the review will take more than 5 /1 hours. 
Also, I am working on gathering information in response to Laura's email and expect to be able to respond to it later this 
evening.

My apologies, I meant to include in my previous email that we could have the Bronx view on Monday April 12. Thank you 
for the logistics. 
Regarding the spreadsheets you provided, I have several issues. 
First, there are a couple of items that you have noted for the Bronx Warehouse but will in fact need to be brought to 500 
Pearl for review because you labeled them as "Highly Confidential" and not "bulky." These appear to include: 
NY Evidence List 
• Items 16127-130 (4 boxes). 
• Item 1B13 (1 box) 
Florida Evidence List 
• Item 1, Subitem 26 — one large framed photo from Master Bedroom. 
Second, with regard to the "Bulky" photos (Florida Items 1, Subitems 8, 15a, 15b and 15c), are we permitted to 
photograph those or not? If not, we will need them transported to 500 Pearl. 
Third, Florida Item 8, Subitem 8, says it is Sixteen DVD-R Discs from PESO but you do not indicate that we can review 
those. Why? We need to address with the Court promptly any issues related to our request to view all evidence. 
Fourth, Electronic surveillance — Your email yesterday stated that these were all "electronic files" with no corresponding 
physical item. However, for several, the chart indicates "Blu-Ray Disks;" is there a reason we cannot inspect these? 
Another Florida item is listed as "one original recording of an interview dated 4/24/07"; I am suspicious that "one original 
recording of an interview" is not truly only an "electronic" file? I was practicing law in 2007 and do not recall "electronic 
EFTA00032670
--- PAGE 3 ---
files" being the standard then. Can you please confirm? I know that Chris has written separately about the many files for 
which the metadata has apparently been stripped, so we will have to address purely electronic information at another 
date. 
Shredded Paper — Yes, we need to review that as well. 
"Missing from Assigned Box" items — can you please provide more of an explanation for all "missing items"? 
I will let you know any other issues as I see them. However, now that we have made travel plans in reliance on your 
agreement to produce all evidence items, I am hoping that you can promptly answer these questions so that we can 
resolve any of them as needed this week. 
Thank you,

Hi Laura, 
The Bronx warehouse is located at 2350 Lafayette Ave, Bronx, NY. There is plenty of street parking outside of the 
building. Whatever day you wish to have the review conducted at the warehouse, an AUSA and an agent will meet the 
attorney, investigator, and paralegal at the warehouse to escort them into the building to the evidence review room. The 
AUSA will remain present at the warehouse to answer any questions that may arise. 
The FBI has informed me that they can make the evidence available for review at the warehouse any day next week or the 
week of April 19th. Please just let me know what day you prefer, and we will coordinate with the FBI to arrange for the 
review.

I believe we will be able to have an attorney, investigator and paralegal present at the Bronx warehouse to take photos of 
the "excluded from transportation" items. Please let us know the particulars for that visit when you have a moment.

Good morning, 
Attached please find the revised spreadsheets, which reflect designations under the Protective Order for the three mini-
VHS tapes that I referenced below. 
I learned this morning that the Marshals intend to bring Ms. Maxwell back to the MDC each review day at 4:30pm. So we 
can plan for the review to take place at 500 Pearl Street from 9:30am to 4:30pm each day beginning on April 13th.

Good evening, 
Today, the Marshals confirmed that they will produce Ms. Maxwell to 500 Pearl Street on April 13, 2021 and every day 
thereafter until the evidence review is complete. My understanding is that Ms. Maxwell should arrive to 500 Pearl Street 
at approximately 9:30am each morning. So we are confirmed for evidence review in the proffer rooms on the 5th floor of 
the 500 Pearl Street courthouse beginning at 9:30am on April 13th. I will plan to be present and to continue assisting with 
logistics. If any questions or concerns arise, please feel free to call my cellphone at 
To assist in preparing for this review, attached please find annotated versions of the three evidence spreadsheets I 
previously emailed to you: (1) a spreadsheet of New York evidence; (2) a spreadsheet of Florida evidence; and (3) a more 
detailed spreadsheet of the sub-items contained in the Florida evidence spreadsheet. A couple things to note: 
• These spreadsheets now indicate the Protective Order designation, if any, for each item to be reviewed. As you will 
see, there are three mini-VHS tapes that I need to double check before assigning a final designation. I expect to be 
able to access a mini-VHS cassette player later this week, at which point I will be able to provide an updated 
spreadsheet with a confirmed designation for those three items. Additionally, please note that there is one item 
about which we plan to provide you with a letter later this week. 
• These spreadsheets also indicate where each item will be made available for the defense to review. As you will see, 
we have now learned that one item (consisting of shredded paper) is currently at FBI headquarters and will not be 
available for review next week. Please let me know if you believe you need to review that item, and I will inquire as 
to whether and how it can be relocated to New York. Additionally, all 1D items consist of electronic data (as 
opposed to 1B items, which are physical items). As is noted in the spreadsheets, the electronic data that constitute 
the 1D items in this case have either already been produced to you in discovery (e.g., pen register data, CPS data, 
and aerial footage), or are digital recordings of interviews that will be produced as non-testifying witness 
statements. Because these 1D items are data files stored in the FBI system, there is no corresponding physical item 
to produce for you to review. 
Please let me know when you would like to schedule a time for a smaller group from the defense team to review evidence 
at the Bronx warehouse.

Laura, 
Thank you for your email and for your understanding as we work through the logistics of arranging this review. Your 
modifications and clarifications are acceptable to us. Below I address each specifically: 
• The FBI can arrange for a lawyer, investigator, and paralegal to inspect and photograph the precluded items at the 
Bronx warehouse either next week or the week after. Please let us know what day you would like to arrange for 
that inspection, and I will coordinate with the FBI accordingly. I would suggest trying to schedule this visit early 
next week if possible so that if there are items that you believe need to be produced to 500 Pearl Street, we will 
have time to do so during a subsequent day of review at 500 Pearl if the FBI agrees to transport the item(s). 
• Tomorrow, I will send you evidence spreadsheets with annotations of which items the FBI will not be producing to 
500 Pearl Street, and which items we are designating under the Protective Order. Please note that certain items 
will be designated "Confidential," in which case they may be photographed, but the photographs should be treated 
as Confidential under the Protective Order. Other items will be designated "Highly Confidential," in which case they 
may not be photographed, absent specific authorization from an AUSA. I note the possibility of authorization to 
photograph this latter category because some Highly Confidential evidence items include both nude and non-nude 
portions, in which case we would permit photography of the non-nude portions. 
• In light of our decision to produce non-testifying witness statements beginning on April 12, 2021, we are no longer 
segregating any electronic media that contain witness statements during this review. This is because all of the 
witness statements on the electronic media in the FBI's possession are from witnesses whom the Government does 
not expect to call at trial in this case. Please note that we intend to produce digital audio files to you containing the 
contents of the electronic media with these non-testifying witness statements, but you are of course welcome to 
review the original recordings themselves. 
• In terms of space, I have been informed that we will not be permitted to conduct this review in a courtroom and 
will instead be required to do so in the proffer rooms. I have reserved the two largest proffer rooms available at 
500 Pearl. We can use the largest proffer room for evidence review, and the slightly smaller proffer room as a 
private meeting space for the defense team. 
• Confirmed, I will ask the FBI to bring all electronic highly confidential images to 500 Pearl Street, including the 
2,100 that were not previously reviewed and the electronic images that were previously provided for review at the 
MDC. 
• Confirmed, I will ask the FBI to bring the 7 hard-copy highly confidential materials to 500 Pearl Street. 
As I mentioned earlier today in a separate email, the FBI and AUSAs are prepared to facilitate this review beginning April 
13th and continuing every day thereafter until your review is complete. I have also formally requested that the Marshals 
produce Ms. Maxwell to 500 Pearl Street on April 13th and every day thereafter until the review is complete. The 
Marshals previously confirmed their willingness to produce Ms. Maxwell for such a review in general, but they have not 
yet confirmed their ability to do so on any particular dates. I will let you know as soon as the Marshals inform me 
whether they can accommodate these specific dates.

Subject: RE: US v. Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes 
Thank you for your email. Your proposal is largely acceptable to us, with the following modifications and clarifications. 
• For the items that you propose below to exclude from the evidence transported to 500 Pearl Street (with the 
exception of the cash held at 26 Federal Plaza), we will need to have access for a lawyer, investigator and paralegal 
to inspect and photograph those items at the Bronx warehouse. This seems to include the bulky items, electronic 
devices and "fragile" items. 
o Once they are photographed and shared with the team and our client, we can decide whether a separate 
inspection by our client and/or any expert is necessary at a later time. To be clear, the government's photos 
of these same items are insufficient. 
o If there are any items we are not permitted to photograph (and perhaps you will be able to tell us by April 5 
which those are), we likely will need to have those transported because there is no way for our client to 
inspect the evidence. We can wait to finalize this issue until you have finished deciding what items you 
consider non-photographable, and if we can't agree, then discuss next steps. 
o Please let us know when these "non-transportable" items can be inspected and photographed at the Bronx 
warehouse. It makes sense that it would be done soon so that we can raise any issues as necessary with the 
Court. 
• For playing any of the electronic media, we will obtain the necessary equipment to play at 500 Pearl Street and 
seek permission to bring those devices into the Courthouse. You can segregate out the section of recordings that 
contain "witness statements" and advise us then which ones cannot be played, but we still need to inspect the 
outside of those recordings. 
• As far as space, can you please advise whether the largest proffer room will be available for review of evidence? It 
is my understanding that it can accommodate a large number of the team members at one time. If not, is a locked 
courtroom available for us to review the evidence? The agents could bring out a limited number of boxes at a time 
for inspection. 
• We understand that the evidence will not be taken outside of the monitoring of the agents or your staff and 
appreciate that you will have a separate room for us to consult with our client privately (without the evidence). 
• We understand that all of the highly confidential materials, including not only the 2,100 images not previously 
disclosed as well as the electronic images that were only shown to NY counsel and the client at the MDC, will be 
available for review on a singular laptop at 500 Pearl Street. 
• We also understand the 7 hard-copy highly confidential materials will also be available for inspection at 500 Pearl 
Street. 
Please let me know if you have any questions or disagree with my understanding. If you agree, we can then proceed as 
scheduled on April 12 and continue day to day until we are finished, with a break if necessary for the arraignment.

Subject: RE: US v. Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes 
< 
Counsel, 
Thank you for your email. Below please find our response. If this is acceptable to you, then we will proceed with 
arranging the logistics of having your client produced to 500 Pearl the week of April 12th and the week April 19th. We will 
also arrange for the FBI to transport evidence to 500 Pearl for review the week of April 12th. 
Physical Evidence 
• It is not reasonable or feasible to insist that the FBI bring all physical evidence to 500 Pearl Street. That said, we are 
certainly willing to work with you to ensure that your client can review any physical items that are material to the 
preparation of her defense. 
• We would propose excluding the below items from production to 500 Pearl: 
o We appreciate your note that the massage tables are not needed, which will certainly help with the logistics 
of transport. 
o We also appreciate your indication that the cash items from 26 Federal Plaza do not need to be produced. 
Those are the only items not located in the Bronx warehouse. 
o The FBI has seized dozens of electronic devices, including desktop computers, servers, and laptops, from 
Jeffrey Epstein's residences in 2019. Photographs of those devices were produced in our August 2020 
productions as part of the search warrant photographs, and you have received copies of the data that was 
seized from those devices pursuant to a warrant. The production of these devices would be very 
cumbersome, and we do not see any value in looking at an electronic device that cannot be turned on. 
o The framed pictures are bulky and cumbersome to transport. These are also very delicate and are difficult 
to transport. Photographs of those seized images were already provided to you as part of the photographs 
from the searches of Epstein's residences. 
o Certain items seized from the New York residence are bulky, fragile, and/or difficult to transport. These 
include plaster busts of female torsos and a stuffed dog. Photographs of these items were already provided 
to you from the search of the New York residence. 
• The remaining physical items of evidence would fit into approximately 15 to 20 boxes. The FBI has indicated that it 
would be feasible to transport those boxes to 500 Pearl Street. 
• Regarding your request for equipment that can play the recordings, we believe they would require a VCR, a cassette 
player, a CD player, an adapter for a micro VHS tape, and a microcassette player. If you wish to play these 
recordings at 500 Pearl, you will need to provide that equipment. We have asked the FBI whether any other 
equipment would be necessary and will let you know if that is the case prior to the date of your review. It is our 
understanding that any recordings that are not witness statements and that are not highly confidential have been 
produced to you in discovery. We are not aware of any discoverable, non-highly confidential, recordings that were 
not produced to you as part of the Government's discovery productions in the fall. To confirm that understanding, 
we are working with the FBI to physically doublecheck each recording. If we identify any discoverable recordings 
that have not already been produced, we will promptly provide them to you. 
• The segregation of highly confidential material will require the FBI and an AUSA to physically review each item to 
confirm the item's status. We will endeavor to do so by your requested date of April 5, 2021. 
EFTA00032676
--- PAGE 9 ---
• We can confirm that neither the AUSA(s) nor the agent(s) will record or attempt to record any part of the evidence 
review or conversations among the defense team or with the defendant during this review. Although the evidence 
cannot be left outside of the presence of an agent, we will ensure that a room is available for the defense team and 
the defendant to confer privately away from the agent(s) and the AUSA(s) without monitoring. 
• As for your request for a space large enough to fit 8 members of the defense team, the defendant, an agent, an 
AUSA, and the evidence, my office cannot control the space that the Marshals allow us to use at 500 Pearl outside 
of the proffer rooms. We will certainly request as large a space as possible, but if we are required to use the 
proffer rooms, then members of the defense team may need to rotate in and out of the room. I know members of 
the defense team have been in those proffer rooms before, and they can hopefully provide some thoughts on how 
we might use the proffer room space effectively for your purposes. If the Court grants authorization for the 
defense to bring electronic devices into 500 Pearl, that is certainly fine with the Government, and you may note our 
consent in your request to Judge Nathan for such authorization. 
Highly Confidential Electronic Images 
. The 2,100 electronic images were recovered during the responsiveness review of images and videos seized from 
Jeffrey Epstein's devices, which review was not complete until early November 2020. We indicated on page 4 the 
cover letter to our November 9, 2020 production, which included all other images and videos from those devices, 
that "the Federal Bureau of Investigation ('FBI') seized multiple nude and partially nude images from several for the 
above-listed electronic devices. All such images have been designated Highly Confidential. The FBI will make these 
images available for review by the defense upon request." We did not receive a request from the defense to review 
these images until your March 8, 2021 letter, which requested to "view and inspect all materials designated by your 
office as 'Highly Confidential' under the terms of the Protective Order". 
• We did not ask the FBI to bring the 7 hard copy images to the MDC in the fall because we did not understand you to 
be requesting a review of physical, non-electronic evidence during those meetings. Our understanding of the 
defense request at that time was to review the electronic highly confidential images that were recovered from CDs 
from Epstein's residence. We will ensure that the 7 hard copy images are available to you for review at 500 Pearl.

Subject: RE: US v. Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes 
All, 
We have considered your proposal. Unfortunately, it does not permit us an adequate ability to review the evidence in the 
case and does not permit our client to meaningfully participate in her own defense. 
EFTA00032677
--- PAGE 10 ---
First, we are unable to meaningfully review the evidence without the benefit of our laptops and other electronic devices 
which are needed to take notes of our review. We also need access to our devices during the review to compare the 
physical evidence with the electronic discovery and with our work product. 
Second, we need to provide our client the ability to review all discovery, including any recordings, in order to assist in her 
own defense. Presuming that she will not be taken to the FBI downtown office, then your proposal offers no means by 
which she can both inspect a recording in its physical form and listen to the recording at the same time. 
In order to address the deficiencies in your proposal, we believe the following are necessary: 
Physical Evidence 
• All of the physical evidence currently located in the FBI Bronx warehouse will be transported to 500 Pearl Street 
and made available during the week of April 12, with our client present, in a room sufficiently large to 
accommodate 8 attorneys and investigators. 
o We do not need the "bulky" massage tables transported; if there are any other extremely large evidence 
pieces, let us know what they are and we can consider whether we can have someone review and 
photograph those at the Bronx warehouse at an earlier time. 
o From your email, it appears that only two items are not located at the Bronx warehouse — both envelopes 
with cash. Please confirm this. We do not need the two "cash" evidence items transported to 500 Pearl. 
o If there are other evidence items housed somewhere other than the Bronx, please let us know what they are 
and where they are. 
• We will be permitted to bring our laptops, and a camera, into 500 Pearl Street; we are happy to seek permission 
from Judge Nathan to do so. 
• Either the FBI can provide the equipment necessary to listen to any of the recordings at 500 Pearl Street or we can 
bring the necessary equipment. If we are to provide the equipment, we will need to know in advance the formats 
of each recording so that we can be prepared. You can note that on your Excel spreadsheet by the item number by 
March 29 to give us adequate time to secure the necessary equipment. 
• The FBI can segregate any physical evidence that you deem "highly confidential." You can identify any "highly 
confidential" physical evidence items on your Excel spreadsheets by April 5 (one week before the evidence view). If 
we need to photograph or reproduce any such item for expert evaluation, we will seek leave of court. Otherwise, 
we will not photograph any such items during the review during the week of April 12. This will ensure the evidence 
review proceeds smoothly and there will not be any need to ask permission to photograph on an item by item 
basis. 
• The FBI also can segregate any recordings which we will be able to inspect, but not listen to, during the evidence 
view the week of April 12. You can note such designation on your Excel spreadsheet. If we disagree, we can seek 
leave of the Court in advance. 
• We understand that an FBI Agent and/or AUSA may be present during our physical evidence review at 500 Pearl 
Street but of course must ensure that no recordings are made of our conversations and also ensure that there is a 
separate, secure room in which we can confer with our client during the evidence view without monitoring by the 
government. 
• Please confirm whether all electronic recordings (other than the highly-confidential images and videos described 
below) have previously been produced to us, and if not, please explain which ones were not produced by the 
discovery deadlines last fall and why. 
Highly Confidential Electronic Evidence 
• Can you please explain why 2,100 + 7 "highly confidential" images have not been shared with us yet? It was our 
understanding that you previously provided all "highly confidential" images to our client — and to defense counsel —
for review at the MDC in November. We are confused about where these previously undisclosed items were 
located and why they have not yet been made available for inspection and review. 
• During the week of April 19, Ms. Maxwell should be produced to 500 Pearl Street to review (with counsel and a 
defense staff member, on the 1 laptop provided) all of the 5,507 electronic images and video marked "highly 
confidential". These should be segregated into the three categories you describe (never-before produced, 
previously produced, and the 7 hard-copy images). 
EFTA00032678

Please let us know if you will not agree to any of these steps so that we can address the issues with the Court. 
Thank you.

Subject: RE: US v. Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes 
All, 
Attached please find two spreadsheets documenting all physical evidence in the FBI's custody, as well as a corresponding 
discovery cover letter. We are sending a copy of these files to the MDC for your client as well. 
In response to your questions, the FBI has informed me of the following: 
Regarding the Highly Confidential nude/partially nudge images to be reviewed at 500 Pearl: 
• There are three categories of these images: 
o Approximately 2,100 electronic images and videos seized from Epstein's electronic devices (which have not 
been previously provided to you) 
o Approximately 3,400 electronic images from discs seized from Epstein's residences in 2019 (which have 
previously been provided to you and your client for review at the MDC) 
o Approximately 7 hard copy nude images located in the file from the FBI Florida office's investigation of 
Epstein (which have not been previously provided to you) 
• The FBI will make all three of those categories available to you. The electronic files will be provided on hard drives, 
and the FBI will provide you with the hard copy images for review as well. 
o All electronic images should be viewable as thumbnails, except those seized from Apple devices, which must 
be viewed using Cellebrite. 
o The Cellebrite software will be provided on the drive for your review of images and videos seized from Apple 
devices. 
o The electronic files have the same metadata on the hard drive that was available when the FBI seized each 
image. For images that were carved or deleted, no metadata was recovered, so none is viewable. For all 
other images, the metadata recovered should be viewable on the hard drive. 
o The approximately 2,100 electronic images and videos seized from Epstein's devices are separated by folder 
to indicate which device each image was seized from. 
• Because these images are considered obscene material, the FBI is not permitted to make duplicates of them, and 
there is a limited number of clean laptops on which these images can be reviewed. As a result, the FBI is only able 
to provide a single laptop for review of these images. 
Regarding the physical evidence: 
• Attached are two lists of all physical items in the FBI's custody relating to this case. The first list relates to items 
associated with the FBI Florida office's investigation of Epstein. The second list relates to items associated with the 
FBI New York office's current investigation. 
• The vast majority of physical evidence in the FBI's custody is located at the FBI's warehouse in the Bronx. Two 
items (18 77 & 1B 79) are located at 26 Federal Plaza, but the case agents can check those items out from 26 
EFTA00032679
--- PAGE 12 ---
Federal Plaza and bring them to the Bronx warehouse on whatever day you choose to conduct your review so that 
you will have all evidence in one place. 
• The FBI is able to arrange for the defense team to review all physical evidence at the Bronx warehouse under the 
following conditions: 
o The warehouse requires at least two weeks' notice in order to pull all of the items for the entire case and 
place them in a location where a large group of people can view them. 
o The warehouse is open during normal business hours between 9am and 5pm on weekdays. 
o At least two FBI agents and an AUSA will be present at the Bronx warehouse to assist and answer questions. 
o The evidence will be placed in a loading dock at the warehouse to provide additional space for the review. 
To ensure that there is sufficient space, please let me know how many members of the defense team intend 
to be physically present for this review. 
o Electronic devices such as cellphones and laptops are not permitted in the warehouse. The defense team 
may bring a digital camera that is not connected to the Internet or a cellular network into the warehouse. If 
the defense team wishes to photograph an item of evidence, the defense will need to inform the agents who 
are present, so that they may confirm that the photographed item is not Highly Confidential based on the 
presence of nudity. 
o Electronic media such as VHS tapes, cassette tapes, and CDs will not be playable at the warehouse. 
• To the extent the defense requests that the FBI bring any physical items to 500 Pearl Street for your client to review, 
the FBI is prepared to bring items that are reasonably sized to 500 Pearl Street. With respect to bulky or large 
items, the defense team should be able to photograph those for your client to review, unless they are deemed 
Highly Confidential, in which case the FBI can make arrangements to transport the item to 500 Pearl Street if 
necessary. 
• The FBI is in the process of confirming that it can provide devices to play all of the electronic media in the case in a 
single location at the FBI's offices in downtown Manhattan. We are also double-checking to confirm that all media 
that does not contain witness statements have already been produced to you and your client in discovery. The FBI 
anticipates that we can arrange for you to review all non-witness statement electronic media at the FBI's office in 
downtown Manhattan in approximately three weeks. 
o To the extent you wish to review all of the discs containing photographs, which were seized from Epstein's 
residences in 2019, we note that all of those images have already been produced to you in discovery. For 
your awareness, the FBI has informed me that it took their team several weeks to review all of the images on 
all of those discs. 
Please let me know how you wish to proceed.

Now that the FBI team is back, when do you expect to have answers to all of the questions posed? If I had an idea of 
when you would have answers, it could help me answer your question. 
At a minimum, it would not seem to take too much time to know when someone can open the FBI vault and allow the 
attorneys to make an initial view of the evidence. Also, I understand the FBI did not prepare an inventory of their 
evidence when they seized it from NY and LSJ, so I don't think we need to wait for them to now prepare an inventory 
before we start reviewing evidence. 
Also, when do you believe you will have a response regarding the discovery I requested last Monday? 
Thanks, 
Laura

Counsel, 
The FBI team on this case has been out of the office this week and will not be able to answer all of the questions you 
asked during our Wednesday call until they are back in the office next week. Please let me know if you would like to wait 
until all of those questions can be answered to schedule a day for your client to be brought to 500 Pearl Street to review 
the highly confidential images. My understanding is that the FBI is able to provide at least one laptop containing those 
highly confidential images in time for such a review to take place on Thursday 5/18, but I may not have the answers to all 
of your questions about those images before that date, and I do not know whether you will also be able to visit the 
evidence vault that same week. 
Please let me know how you would like to proceed. I will reach back out once I have answers to your questions.

That is the only excel spreadsheet indexing physical evidence that we have produced in discovery. That spreadsheet does 
not include every physical item currently in the FBI's custody related to this case. For example, the August 20, 2020 
discovery production also included search warrant returns listing the physical items seized by the FBI's New York Office 
during the 2019 searches of Jeffrey Epstein's residences in New York and the U.S Virgin Islands (see Bates range 
SDNY_GM_00166007-SDNY_GM_00166043), but they are not contained in a spreadsheet. 
As a courtesy, I have asked the FBI whether it would be possible to provide us with a similar excel index reflecting the 
physical evidence seized by the FBI's New York Office, though it may take some time to compile such an index.

Counsel, 
In advance of our call tomorrow, I wanted to send a copy of the attached index of physical items in FBI custody from the 
FBI-Miami office, which we previously produced to you as part of our August 21, 2020 discovery production. Also 
included in that August 21, 2020 production were scans of numerous items listed on the index. Those scans can be found 
within Bates range SDNY_GM_00172218-SDNY_GM_00173007. It may be useful to reference some of those items during 
our conversation tomorrow, so I wanted to make sure you were aware of them.

Re: USA v Michael Thomas, et al. 
Docket No.: 1:19-cr-00830 
Addendum to Letter Brief in Support of Deferred Prosecution 
Your Honor, 
Please accept this addendum as a supplement to my letter brief, in support of Mr. Michael 
Thomas' Application for Deferred Prosecution. 
1. Additional Adverse Impacts 
Mr. Thomas' life has spiraled down-hill ever since losing his livelihood and reputation 
after being charged in this case. Most notably Mr. Thomas this prosecution has caused Mr. 
Thomas to suffer extreme anxiety and depression. Prior to the events in this case, Mr. Thomas 
was in precarious financial situation, that required him to work as much overtime as possible to 
EFTA00032687
--- PAGE 2 ---
meet his financial obligations. Subsequently, Mr. Thomas has no money to support himself. His 
bills are all past-due and he sees his family, including his children, less than before. He feels a 
tremendous amount of guilt and embarrassment because of his actions. This had led him to rarely 
going out in public and distancing himself from friends and family. Prior to this incident, Mr. 
Thomas was well liked and popular among his co-workers at MCC. Many have reached out to 
show support and check on his well-being however, Mr. Thomas's depression has prevented him 
from strengthening those relationships. 
Additionally, Mr. Thomas is deeply affected by the publicity this case has created. This 
has made it virtually impossible for him to secure another job to support himself and his 
children. Moreover, in almost all the instances wherein he has tried to get another job he has 
been recognized. Once he fills out an application with work history wherein, he includes working 
at MCC, employers recognize him as " the guard who fell asleep on the job." Alternatively, if he 
attempts to hide his previous employment, he has nothing to put on the application for the last 16 
years as to his recent employment which also becomes a huge red flag to potential employers. As 
a result, Mr. Thomas has not been able to secure any employment since losing his job at the 
MCC. 
2. Factors that merit leniency 
There are several factors that militate toward the government showing leniency in this 
case. Most notably, as previously mentioned, Mr. Thomas has strong record of service to his 
country in the armed services. Anyone who serves out country deserves our thanks and praise; 
however, Mr. Thomas' experience was different than many others. Mr. Thomas' military service 
entailed being involved in live action combat where he saw people killed and severely injured. 
EFTA00032688
--- PAGE 3 ---
Mr. Thomas knows what dead bodies smell and look like. This experience has had lasting mental 
effects on Mr. Thomas that he has not shared with anyone. 
3. Events in Question 
Prior to being charged in this case, Mr. Thomas immediately revealed what happened the 
night Mr. Epstein died to prosecutors via his attorney. On August 10, 2019, Mr. Thomas reported 
to the midnight shift to work overtime after working multiple overtime shifts in addition to his 
regular full time shifts in the days and hours preceding this time. He checked in, signed onto the 
computer system, and handled some preliminary paperwork for the upcoming shift. He 
remembers briefly going online to check some sports scores and look at some classifieds. He 
believes that he was on the Internet for well under one hour's time. The next thing he remembers 
is being awakened around 5:00am by the arrival of the morning food cart. Commotion ensued 
and he immediately rushed to check on the inmates, at which time he found Mr. Epstein hanging 
in his cell. 
Mr. Thomas has always maintained that he worked himself too hard and that he was too 
tired when he showed up to that midnight shift. He had worked an excessive number of shifts 
without adequate sleep and rest. As previously discussed, Mr. Thomas was not working the 
multiple over-time shifts out of greed or to save for a boat. He worked the additional shifts to pay 
his rent and child support which required the overtime income. It bears noting to any lay person 
looking at the schedule worked by Mr. Thomas, that it would be impossible for him effectively 
discharge his employment duties. Nonetheless, the administration and the culture of the MCC 
not only allowed this behavior but in many instances encouraged and required it. 
EFTA00032689
--- PAGE 4 ---
4. Acceptance of responsibility 
At approximately 6:00am in the morning immediately following Mr. Thomas attempting 
lifesaving CPR on Jeffrey Epstein, it has been reported that Mr. Thomas immediately accepted 
responsibility for his actions. He has never wavered from acknowledging his wrongdoing and the 
mistakes that he has made. Indeed, from all accounts, it appears that Mr. Thomas alone has stood 
up and acknowledged his failure. This incident could not have happened unless many others also 
failed in the duties but there seems to be little information of anyone other than Mr. Thomas 
accepting responsibility for this tragedy. 
5. Cooperation 
Mr. Thomas is the only person who saw Jeffrey Epstein hanging in his cell. Mr. Thomas 
is one of a very few people to have lengthy conversations with Jeffrey Epstein prior to his death. 
Mr. Thomas will cooperate with all government agencies if this case is resolved with a deferred 
prosecution.

I recall that at some point you requested a version of the Epstein FOIA documents from BOP without the translucent 
green watermark they put on the withheld documents. Do you have those saved down somewhere? Although the Court 
has not put in a specific order yet, I think it's likely that we'll need to produce documents without the translucent green 
marking to the Court. I have versions without the watermark for some of the docs, but it looks like not all. Do you have a 
comprehensive set somewhere?

Sure, thanks — and yes, quite the weekend. If it's alright with you, let's do 10:00 a.m. on Tuesday — you can reach us at

Hi El 
I have spoken to Mark's business support and he is available at 4.15pm (UK time) today (ie in just 
under an hour's time). It is quite urgent so if we could speak then it would be greatly appreciated. 
If that does work please let us know what number to call you on? 
Many thanks

Hi Mark - Thanks for reaching out. We do have an active investigation and would be happy to talk. As you likely know, 
today is a holiday in the US. Is this something we could discuss on Monday or is it more urgent than that? Thanks, Ted

Hi 
Can you let me know, urgently, whether anyone in your office is handling the investigation into 
Jeffery Epstein, especially anything in relation to JP Morgan (he was a client of their private wealth 
division) and, if so, who, as we need to have a chat. If this is not in SDNY, do you know who is 
handling ongoing work into Mr E's world ?

Subject: Epstein Probate 
Hi 
The U.S. Virgin Islands court has recently posted on its website the petition that was filed in the Epstein probate 
proceedings seeking establishment of a victim claims fund. The petition seeks "expedited approval" from the court to 
establish the fund, though no timeline is specified. (It is attached, if of interest.) If approved, estate assets would be 
used to pay for administering the fund, and deadlines would be set for victims to file their claims if they wish to 
participate. 
There was over a week's delay between when the petition was filed with the court and when the court posted the 
petition on its public page for "cases of interest" That page is not an official case docket, though it has at least select 
filings from the probate case (though I cannot tell if all filings are being posted). It would obviously be preferable if we 
had contemporaneous access to a complete docket, but we haven't been able to find a way to access an online 
complete docket. We're inclined to call the Virgin Islands court to ask whether there's a way to access a full electronic 
docket, but we wanted to check whether you have concerns before we do so (we doubt we would need to identify 
ourselves). Let us know your thoughts. 
Belatedly, what's the status of the 6(e) order? 
Thanks,

Good morning-
As reported yesterday, the modifications made in the VTC room 
are negatively impacting attorney-client communication. 
The video is blurry; the audio includes distorting noises. 
I am requesting that these problems be remedied immediately. 
Also, I am bringing to your attention the inappropriate behavior of the 
guards presently on Ms. Maxwell's detail: threatening discipline if 
Ms. Maxwell is "off camera" while leaning against a wall to soothe her aching 
back; barking orders regarding the noise emanating from the washing machine 
and the pace of her gait when walking; laughing amongst themselves as if any of this is funny. 
The manner in which some of the guards responded to me on Sunday gives me reason to be concerned 
about how they treat Ms. Maxwell when out of public view. 
The courtesy of a response is requested. 
Thank you-

Hi Bobbi-
I apologize for the delay in response. I have been out of office sick. 
We are looking into the concerns you have brought to our attention regarding the VTC units. All of the VTC 
units throughout the institution are now being stored in this manner as it is a protective bather for the equipment. 
With that said, we will be doing test runs to investigate concerns you have mentioned. 
Furthermore, Ms. Maxwell must oblige by the orders of the Officers. We offer Ms. Maxwell medical care on a 
daily basis, which she has declined. 
Additionally, can you please provide me with a photo of the ear buds you are requesting to bring into the 
institution? 
Best,

C 
Good afternoon-
Despite being subjected to the most unique, restrictive, and invasive conditions 
of pretrial confinement, Ms. Maxwell has and continues to be a compliant detainee. 
She obeys all orders and commands - often muffled by masks, 
uttered behind prison doors, and/or combined with the din of background noise -
as soon as they are audibly discernible. 
Erratic enforcement of inconsistent rules and regulations imposed by 
revolving teams of guards who exert varying degrees of officiousness 
and contempt toward Ms. Maxwell is the fault of the MDC/BOP, 
not Ms. Maxwell. 
Regards, 
Bobbi

Hi Bobbi-
I apologize for the delay in response. I have been out of office sick. 
We are looking into the concerns you have brought to our attention 
regarding the VTC units. All of the VTC units throughout the 
institution are now being stored in this manner as it is a protective 
barrier for the equipment. With that said, we will be doing test runs 
to investigate concerns you have mentioned. 
Furthermore, Ms. Maxwell must oblige by the orders of the Officers. We 
offer Ms. Maxwell medical care on a daily basis, which she has 
declined. 
Additionally, can you please provide me with a photo of the ear buds 
you are requesting to bring into the institution? 
Best, 
BOBBI C STERNHEIM c
> 6/16/2021 10:23 AM >>> 
Good morning-
As reported yesterday, the modifications made in the VTC room 
are negatively impacting attorney-client communication. 
The video is blurry; the audio includes distorting noises. 
I am requesting that these problems be remedied immediately. 
Also, I am bringing to your attention the inappropriate behavior of the 
guards presently on Ms. Maxwell's detail: threatening discipline if 
Ms. Maxwell is "off camera" while leaning against a wall to soothe her 
aching 
back; barking orders regarding the noise emanating from the washing 
machine 
and the pace of her gait when walking; laughing amongst themselves as 
if any of this is funny. 
The manner in which some of the guards responded to me on Sunday gives 
me reason to be concerned 
about how they treat Ms. Maxwell when out of public view. 
The courtesy of a response is requested. 
Thank you-
Bobbi

Subject: Ghislaine Maxwell 02879-509 
Good afternoon-
Earlier this week, around 1:00 am 
guards purposely awoke Ms. Maxwell because they observed her body shaking 
and were concerned that she was having a seizure. 
They determined she was shivering from the extremely cold temperature in her cell. 
At approximately 3:00 am the following day, the guards again disrupted Ms. Maxwell's sleep 
because her body was shaking. Again, they determined that she was 
shivering and gave her a blanket. 
The guards have now removed two of her blankets, claiming the blankets 
are not authorized. Today, Ms. Maxwell awoke cold and headachy 
with a sore throat. When medical staff came by she was too exhausted 
to address her physical discomfort. 
Please explain why guards purposely disrupt Ms. Maxwell's 
sleep, determine she is shivering, and then remove blankets-
her only source of warmth. This makes no sense, is detrimental 
her health, and is utterly insensitive. 
Christian Everdell 
In addition, VTC viewing is less blurry on counsel's end but the image repeatedlybecomes broken 
and then completely blacks out. 
This is disrupting attorney-client communication, the ability to prepare for trial, and is negatively impacting 
counsel's vision and concentration. 
Please address and remedy this problems immediately.

Good afternoon-
Despite being subjected to the most unique, restrictive, and invasive conditions 
of pretrial confinement, Ms. Maxwell has and continues to be a compliant detainee. 
She obeys all orders and commands - often muffled by masks, 
uttered behind prison doors, and/or combined with the din of background noise -
as soon as they are audibly discernible. 
Erratic enforcement of inconsistent rules and regulations imposed by 
revolving teams of guards who exert varying degrees of officiousness 
and contempt toward Ms. Maxwell is the fault of the MDC/BOP, 
not Ms. Maxwell.

Hi Bobbi-
I apologize for the delay in response. I have been out of office sick. 
We are looking into the concerns you have brought to our attention 
regarding the VTC units. All of the VTC units throughout the 
institution are now being stored in this manner as it is a protective 
barrier for the equipment. With that said, we will be doing test runs 
to investigate concerns you have mentioned. 
Furthermore, Ms. Maxwell must oblige by the orders of the Officers. We 
offer Ms. Maxwell medical care on a daily basis, which she has 
declined. 
Additionally, can you please provide me with a photo of the ear buds 
you are requesting to bring into the institution? 
Best,

Good morning-
As reported yesterday, the modifications made in the VTC room 
are negatively impacting attorney-client communication. 
The video is blurry; the audio includes distorting noises. 
I am requesting that these problems be remedied immediately. 
Also, I am bringing to your attention the inappropriate behavior of the 
guards presently on Ms. Maxwell's detail: threatening discipline if 
Ms. Maxwell is "off camera" while leaning against a wall to soothe her 
aching 
back; barking orders regarding the noise emanating from the washing 
machine 
and the pace of her gait when walking; laughing amongst themselves as 
if any of this is funny. 
The manner in which some of the guards responded to me on Sunday gives 
me reason to be concerned 
about how they treat Ms. Maxwell when out of public view. 
The courtesy of a response is requested. 
Thank you-

Hi guys, 
I'm pretty slammed as we're in the thick of a period where we have 23 briefs due in the span of 30 days, plus the usual 
other appeals stuff going on. I've also never been asked to review an entire RTC like this (neither has Sarah, for what it's 
worth), so I don't think you'll get much value-add anyway. I want to be helpful, of course, but is there something discrete 
and tricky you need help with on these?

On behalf of Mr. Avenatti, we make the request below pursuant to Rule 16(a)(1)(EXi) and 
the government's obligations under the Due Process Clause, Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 
(1963), Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972), and their progeny. This request is meant to 
direct the government's attention to specific evidence. It is not intended to be a substitute for 
general categories of evidence that the government is otherwise required to produce under the Due 
Process Clause and the above authorities (e.g., plea agreements, deferred prosecution agreements, 
non-prosecution agreements, promises and benefits to witnesses, threatened charges against 
witnesses, etc.), all of which we request as well. 
On Saturday, November 30, 2019, the New York Times ("Times") published an 
investigative report entitled "Jeffrey Epstein, Blackmail, and a Lucrative 'Hot List'." See 
httns://www.nvtimes.com/2019/11/30/business/david-boies-pottinger-ieffrev -eostein-
videos.html. The Times reported about an agreement between David Boies, the founder of the 
Boies Schiller Flexner ("BSF") law firm and its Chairman and Managing Partner since 1997, and 
attorney John Stanley Pottinger, to purchase what they believed to be videos secretly made by 
Jeffrey Epstein of famous wealthy men engaged in sexual activities with different women at 
Epstein's residence. The videos were supposedly in the possession of a man who identified himself 
to Boies as Patrick Kessler. Because the videos were purportedly made at Epstein's direction, 
Boles and Pottinger undoubtedly believed that at least some of the videos constituted evidence of 
serious criminal sex offenses targeting minors. The Times's reporting suggests that Boies and 
Pottinger were plotting to use the videos to secure multi-million-dollar payoffs from these wealthy 
men in exchange for confidentiality (i.e., concealing the videos from law enforcement and the 
public), in part by entering into agreements to be retained by the actual alleged abusers. The 
evidence further suggests that Boies had no idea whether any of his current clients (alleged Epstein 
victims) were depicted in the videos, but that did not matter to Boies because, as the Times 
EFTA00032751
--- PAGE 2 ---
suggests, even in the absence of clients, Boies and Pottinger were planning to utilize the illicit 
videos to obtain multi-million-dollar settlements from the wealthy men. 
This conduct was the subject of Episode 22 of The Weekly, a television series of the Times, 
which airs on FX and Hulu. Episode 22, which aired a few days ago, included interviews of Boies 
and Pottinger. 
See httos://www.nvtimes.com/2019/11/29/the-weekly/ieffrev-eostein-secret-
videos.html. The interviews confirmed that the purpose of the plan was to get these wealthy men 
to pay money in exchange for what Boies described in his interview as "peace." The "peace" 
meant burying evidence of criminal conduct from the public (and presumably law enforcement). 
As described, Mr. Boies's conduct amounts to conspiracy to commit extortion, as 
interpreted by the USAO-SDNY. In furtherance thereof (i. e., one of several overt acts), Boies and 
Pottinger sought to enlist the assistance of the press as part of their scheme and invited reporters 
from the Times to meet Kessler at the BSF office in Manhattan. According to the Times, "[tjhe 
threat of [a) major news organization writing about the videos - and confirming the existence of 
an extensive surveillance apparatus — could greatly enhance the lawyers' leverage over the wealthy 
men." The conduct, as described, would appear to also violate other criminal statutes, including 
U.S.C. §§2252 and 2252A. Venue for this conduct plainly exists in the Southern District of 
New York. 
As you know, BSF lawyers were the ones who reported Mr. Avenatti's alleged scheme to 
extort Nike to federal law enforcement and the USAO-SDNY. Based on our prior conversations 
with you, it is clear that one or more BSF lawyers will be witnesses at Mr. Avenatti's trial. 
Evidence that their boss and law partner David Boies may have engaged in the above-described 
conduct — and could potentially be prosecuted by the USAO-SDNY — is highly relevant to the 
motives of the testifying BSF lawyers to curry favor with the government. After all, Boies is 
known to be a chief rainmaker at the BSF firm and his reputation has been essential to the success 
of BSF. Indeed, if Boies were indicted for this conduct, the partners at BSF would surely suffer a 
substantial financial impact. 
Accordingly, we demand any evidence in the possession of the USAO-SDNY 
pertaining to David Boies's conduct as described in the Times report and Episode 22 of The 
Weekly. We further demand disclosure of whether Boies or any other members of his law 
firm are under federal investigation for the conduct described in the Times report and The 
Weekly. And if not, why not? 
Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. 
Respectfully, 
SCOTT A. SREBNICK

Re: 
United States v. Michael Avenatti, 
Si 19 Cr. 373 (PGG) 
Dear Mr. Srebnick: 
We write in response to your letter dated December 2, 2019, which requests certain 
information in light of a New York Times article dated November 30, 2019 concerning Jeffrey 
Epstein and alleged videos, and Episode 22 of The Weekly, a television series of the New York 
Times, concerning the same. 
In your letter, you cite Federal Rule of Evidence 16(a)(1)(E)(i), the Due Process Clause, 
Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972), and their 
progeny. However, insofar as your request is premised on the proposition that, as you stated in 
the email enclosing your letter, the information you seek may constitute impeachment material of 
potential Government witnesses associated with Boies Schiller Flexner LLP ("BSF"), we 
understand it to be a request solely for impeachment material under Giglio and its progeny. As 
you are aware, the defendant is not entitled to such material at this time (nor has the Government 
yet determined precisely which witnesses it will call at trial). Rather, the parties have previously 
agreed, in writing, that the Government will provide such material, if any exists, on or before 
January 14, 2020. We are aware of our obligation in this respect, and intend to comply timely. 
In any event, to the extent that we understand your request, we do not agree that you are 
entitled to what you seek, assuming arguendo that it exists, and assuming further that the 
prosecution team (which is not on any Jeffrey Epstein-related investigation) both had it and was 
at liberty to provide it. See generally United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97, 109 n.16 (1976). We 
also note that Scott Wilson, Esq. has moved from BSF to DLA Piper. Notwithstanding this view, 
we are available to confer at your convenience regarding your request, to ensure that we understand 
it fully, and in the interest of seeking to narrow or moot potential disputes in advance of trial. 
Please be advised, however, that irrespective of the resolution of your request, we expect 
that we would object to you offering any evidence or argument concerning the above-referenced 
allegations, including during your opening statement or in cross-examination, as both improper 
06.20.2018 
EFTA00032753

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 221 Filed 04/20/21 Page 1 of 5 
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
United States of America, 
—v—
Ghislaine Maxwell, 
Defendant. 
USDC SDNY 
DOCUMENT 
ELECTRONICALLY FILED 
DOC 0: 
DATE FILED: 4/20/21 
20-CR-330 (MN) 
ORDER 
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
Last summer, the Court scheduled trial in this matter to commence on July 12, 2021. The 
Government filed an S2 Superseding Indictment on March 29, 2021. Dkt. No. 187. The new 
indictment alleges that the conspiracies charged in Counts I and 3 extended to 2004 (the S1 
charged through 1997) and identifies a fourth alleged victim, Minor Victim-4. It also adds two 
new charges: Count 5 of the S2 Indictment charges Maxwell with participating in a sex 
trafficking conspiracy between 2001 and 2004, and Count 6 charges Maxwell with participating 
in the sex trafficking of a minor or aiding and abetting the same. Id. 
Since the filing of the S2 indictment, the parties have argued in letters whether its 
additional charges and extended timeframe necessitates an adjournment of the trial date. Dkt. 
Nos. 192, 199, and 202. Maxwell has also indicated that she either is requesting or will request a 
renewed bail hearing in light of the filing of the S2. In Maxwell's most recent letter, she 
expressly requests an adjournment of the scheduled July 12 trial date, though the scope of the 
request is unclear. Dkt. No. 202. The letter first argues that a 90-day adjournment is necessary. 
But it also states that some of her defense counsel are not available between September and 
December 2021, implying that the request is in fact to adjourn until January 2022. The 
Government opposes the request for adjournment and any request for a renewed bail hearing. 
EFTA00032766
--- PAGE 2 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 221 Filed 04/20/21 Page 2 of 5 
After the parties submitted these letters, the Court issued its Opinion & Order denying 
Maxwell's motions to dismiss the SI indictment on multiple grounds. Dkt. No. 207. The Court 
also granted severance as to the perjury counts. Both the denial of the motions to dismiss and the 
severance of the perjury counts are relevant to the requests for a bail hearing and for an 
adjournment of the trial date. The Court addresses both in this Order. 
First, the request for a renewed bail hearing is denied. The Court held an original bail 
hearing on July 14, 2020. After extensive argument and presentation of information, the Court 
found that no conditions or combination of conditions could reasonably assure the Defendant's 
appearance as required, determining as a result that Maxwell was a flight risk and that detention 
without bail was warranted under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(1). Dkt. No. 23. The Court based its 
conclusion on the presumption in favor of detention, 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(3), and its weighing of 
the 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g) factors, including the nature and circumstances of the offense charged, 
the weight of the evidence, and Maxwell's history and characteristics. Since that time, Maxwell 
has twice sought reconsideration of the Court's original bail determination and offered different 
bail packages and proposed conditions of release. The Court carefully considered those requests 
and denied them in written Orders, concluding that none of the new information had any material 
bearing on the Court's original conclusion and that the Government again met its burden of 
establishing that Maxwell poses a substantial risk of flight and that no conditions or combination 
of conditions could reasonably assure her appearance as required. Dkt. Nos. 106, 169. 
Maxwell now seeks a new bail hearing at which "witnesses [would] testify regarding the 
purported strength of the government's case." Dkt. No. 192 at 3. The request is denied. The S2 
Indictment raises no issues that warrant reconsideration of the Court's prior bail determinations. 
On the contrary, the new charges contained in the S2 indictment as well as the Court's resolution 
EFTA00032767
--- PAGE 3 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 221 Filed 04/20/21 Page 3 of 5 
of the pre-trial motions strengthen, rather than weaken, the Court's prior conclusions regarding 
flight risk. Maxwell is entitled to appeal that detention determination, and she is exercising that 
right. But it does not follow that the new charges call for the Court to revisit its three prior bail 
determinations. Further, the Court will not hold an evidentiary hearing in which the strength of 
the Government's case is tested. "It is well established in this circuit that proffers are 
permissible both in the bail determination and bail revocation contexts." United States v. 
LaFontaine, 210 F.3d 125, 131 (2d Cir. 2000). Before making its prior bail determinations, the 
Court scrutinized, among the other relevant factors, the Government's proffer and concluded that 
the proffered case was strong. The ultimate merits of the Government's case will be tested at 
trial in front of a jury. In the meantime, it is the Court's obligation to ensure that the case 
proceed to that trial as expeditiously as possible, taking into account the interests of justice and 
all relevant circumstances. The Court is obligated to consider what is in the best interest of the 
public and the defendant in considering whether delay is appropriate. See 18 U.S.C. 
§3161(h)(7)(A). Moreover, the Crime Victims' Rights Act provides a right "to proceedings free 
from unreasonable delay." 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(7). 
This leads directly to the question of the specific start date of trial and Maxwell's request 
for an adjournment. As a preliminary matter, the Court provides the following important 
information. Although last summer the Court set trial to commence on July 12, 2021, currently 
the precise start date of any trial in the Southern District of New York is not within the control of 
the presiding judge. SDNY is still operating under special protocols for jury selection during the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Because of a limited number of reconfigured courtrooms and spaces large 
enough to hold jury selection and trial safely, the protocols centralize the scheduling of access to 
juries and reconfigured courtrooms pursuant to an established protocol for trial priority. The 
EFTA00032768
--- PAGE 4 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 221 Filed 04/20/21 Page 4 of 5 
deadline to submit requests for jury selection dates in the third quarter of 2021 is May 15. 
Following the submission of requests, the Clerk's Office will assign jury selection dates 
according to a protocol that has rules of priority. For example, criminal jury trials requesting a 
particular jury selection date are given priority over civil jury trials requesting that same date. 
Criminal trials involving detained defendants are given priority over criminal trials in which 
defendants are not detained pre-trial. Among detained defendants, cases that set trial dates prior 
to March 16, 2020 get priority. For any detained defendants whose trial date was set after March 
16, 2020, priority is based upon who has been detained the longest. Absent a grant of an 
adjournment, by May 15, the Court will request a jury selection date as close to July 12, 2021 as 
possible. Once a jury selection date is assigned by the Clerk's Office, that date is firm. As of 
now, the parties should presume that trial will commence on a date close to July 12 (depending 
on trial demand and the order of priority) and plan accordingly. 
With this information in mind, the Court seeks confirmation and express clarification 
from defense counsel for three reasons. First, Maxwell's request for an adjournment came 
before the Court ruled on the pending motions, including the Court's granting of Maxwell's 
request to sever the perjury counts. Trial on the non-perjury counts will proceed first, which will 
shorten preparations for and the length of trial on the non-perjury counts. Second, Maxwell's 
request was ambiguous as to the length of adjournment being requested. As noted, the letter 
argued a 90-day adjournment was necessary but also suggested that some number of her defense 
counsel would not be available until January 2022. And third, by this Order the Court denies 
Maxwell's request for a renewed bail hearing. All of these factors may influence Maxwell's 
adjournment request. 
EFTA00032769
--- PAGE 5 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 221 Filed 04/20/21 Page 5 of 5 
Accordingly, the Court hereby ORDERS counsel for the Defendant to file written 
answers to the following specific questions by 12:00 p.m. on Thursday, April 22, 2021: 
1. Does defense counsel continue to seek an adjournment of the July 12th start date for 
trial on the non-perjury counts? 
2. If the answer to question 1 is yes, what is the specific request being made as to length 
of adjournment? In particular, is the request for a 90-day adjournment? An 
adjournment until January 2022? Or something else? The Court requires a specific 
request be made and justified or it will not be considered. 
If Maxwell continues to seek an adjournment, the Government may submit any response 
by 5:00 pm on April 22, 2021. The Court will consider the submissions and resolve 
expeditiously. As noted, however, unless and until an adjournment is specifically requested and 
granted, the parties shall assume that the Court will request a jury selection date as close to July 
12'h as possible and shall plan accordingly. 
SO ORDERED.

Judge Nathan - 
Pursuant to this Court's Order of April 20, 2021 (Dkt. 221), attached please find counsel's Letter Motion for an 
Adjournment of the trial. 
Counsel for Ms. Maxwell request redaction of their other clients' names and case numbers from this Letter Motion 
pursuant to Rule of Professional Conduct 1.6 which prohibits lawyers from revealing confidential information related to a 
client even where that information is publicly available. See In Re. Anonymous, 654 N.E. 2.d. 1128 (Ind. 1995) (lawyer 
violated Rule 1.6 by disclosing information relating to representation of client, even though information "was readily 
available from public sources and not confidential in nature"); In re Bryan, 61 P.3d 641 (Kan. 2003) (lawyer violated Rule 
1.6 by disclosing, in court documents, existence of defamation suit against former client); State ex reL Okla. Bar Ass'n v. 
McGee, 48 P.3d 787, 791 (Okla. 2002) (a lawyer's duty of confidentiality attaches "to all information relating to the 
representation, whatever its source"). 
Upon direction of the Court, counsel will file either the redacted or unredacted version of this letter on the public docket.

Good afternoon, 
I am one of the federal prosecutors handling the prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein's co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell, in the 
Southern District of New York under case caption United States v. Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN). 
and 
from the FBI provided me with your contact information and suggested you may be able to assist our team in contacting 
current and former employees of the Palm Beach Police Department who may need to testify at the upcoming trial in our 
case. In particular, our team expects to introduce evidence gathered during the PBPD's investigation of Epstein in 2005, 
primarily from the search of Epstein's residence in October 2005, and we will need PBPD witnesses to authenticate that 
evidence. 
Would you be available for a call this week to discuss the particular witnesses we are hoping to contact, please? I can be 
reached any time on my cellphone at 
and am also happy to schedule a time that is convenient for a call. 
Thank you very much for your help.

Thank you! The issue with production 11 is that defense counsel has expressed difficulty reviewing the metadata on the 
images contained in the production. In particular, the FBI created the attached spreadsheet, which listed the metadata 
the FBI was able to extract from the images, but defense counsel has indicated they have no way of knowing which bates 
numbered image in the production corresponds with which row in the spreadsheet. I'm hoping there's something in the 
production we can point them to that will help them match up each bates number with each row in the spreadsheet.

Bloomberg 
Good afternoon. Here's what you need to know to end your day. 
• The retail mood turned sour on dreary earnings. 
• People listening in on Trump's Ukraine call said things weren't right. 
• Want a raise? Move to Texas. 
Home Depot and Kohl's posted disappointing results, raising doubts 
about whether American consumers can keep up the spending as the 
holiday season approaches. 
• Home Depot's weak performance—comp sales grew 3.6% last 
quarter versus the 4.6% consensus—was all the more surprising 
since the company had told investors that the second half of the year 
would be better. Same-store sales have now trailed projections for 
three straight quarters 
• At Kohl's, that metric increased 0.4% in the third quarter, half of 
what analysts expected. The retailer now says profit ex-items will be 
$4.75 to $4.95—with the new top of the range 50 cents below the 
previous outlook 
• Urban Outfitters reported same-store sales of 3%, which topped 
the Consensus Metrix estimate but was down from 8% a year ago. 
Comparable sales at its chains—Urban Outfitters, Free People and 
Anthropologie—all missed. Shares fell more than 10% in late trading. 
• And then there was Macy's, which doesn't report until Thursday. It 
fell 11% after confirming some customers were exposed to a data 
hack while shopping on its website last month. 
• TJX had a better day. Shares rose on what MKM's Roxanne Meyer 
called a "high quality" quarter. She believes the T.J. Maxx and 
HomeGoods owner will continue to benefit from exceptional 
products, effective marketing and new customer growth. 
EFTA00032804
--- PAGE 2 ---
• Stocks ended the day mixed as investors weighed the retail 
data against new developments in the trade saga. 
The second week of public impeachment hearings began with two 
witnesses saying that Trump's Ukraine call was inappropriate. 
• Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman said the July 25 call 
between Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr 
Zelenskiy, which he listened in on, so alarmed him that he reported it 
to the White House counsel. "It was inappropriate, it was improper 
for the president to request, to demand an investigation into 
a political opponent," he said. 
• Jennifer Williams, a State Department employee assigned to VP 
Mike Pence's office who also listened in, said the call was outside 
the bounds of typical presidential interactions since "it involved 
discussion of what appeared to be a domestic political matter." 
• Under questioning from Republican staff lawyer Steve Castor,

Impeachment Update 
The U.S.-China trade deal that fell apart six months ago has become the 
benchmark to decide how much tariffs should be reduced in the initial 
phase of an agreement, people familiar said. The White House is debating 
the precise rollback, ranging from 35% to 60%. Beijing is demanding that 
all levies imposed after May be removed immediately and those before

then be lifted gradually. Pence said that it would be "very hard" to sign a 
deal if protests in Hong Kong are met with violence. 
Speaking of which, the Senate is expected to pass bipartisan legislation 
to support Hong Kong's protesters by unanimous consent later today. If it 
passes, the bill would need to be reconciled with a slightly different House 
version before going to Trump for his signature, who's yet to indicate 
whether he will sign. 
America's big banks are getting further relief from capital demands as 
regulators set up a new approach for measuring risk in derivatives trades. 
The revision will result in banks being considered to have about 9% less 
exposure in their derivatives contracts, according to regulators' estimates. 
It's the latest of a series of rollbacks coordinated by Trump appointees. 
Opinion 
The scaling back of Saudi Aramco's IPO—despite nearly every major 
investment bank being involved— raises awkward questions about the 
effectiveness of mammoth syndicates of advisers and bookrunners, Chris 
Hughes writes for Bloomberg Opinion. Diluted accountability makes it 
unlikely that anyone will deliver an unpopular message, like that the deal 
isn't worth $2 trillion. And many, many banks may not add much in terms of 
selling shares given that there's probably huge overlap between 
their investment fund clients. More appears to be less 
The merger party may be coming to an end, Bloomberg Opinion's Joe 
Nocera writes. One of the FTC's two Democratic commissioners, Rohit 
Chopra, has written that there's some evidence drug mergers "have 
, creating harms that are immeasurable for those 
choked off innovation 
waiting for a cure." He also believes that the FTC can block mergers on 
antitrust grounds. Since some senators who are also presidential 
candidates have called for greater M&A scrutiny, it's a pretty good bet that 
a new administration will view takeovers in a different light.

People Who Retire Comfortably Avoid These 7 Financial Advisor

Warby Parker wants to be the Warby Parker of contact lenses. The 
retailer is introducing Scout, a line of daily contacts. It's the first time the 
company has expanded beyond eyeglasses since its founding almost a 
decade ago. At $440 for a year's supply, they'll be slightly cheaper than 
many daily lenses but will be sold with what Warby says will be a much 
improved ordering process. 
The Haredim have long been isolated from secular Israeli society. 
Programs like the Pardes Project seek to better integrate these ultra-
Orthodox scholars into the economy. That's caught the attention of 
Mossad, the nation's intelligence agency, which wants to attract more 
Haredim in a tight labor market. "These people are geniuses, and they 
have no opportunities," says Pardes founder Moshe Kahan.

What Everybody's Talking About 
Two guards at a Manhattan jail who were supposed to keep watch on 
financier Jeffrey Epstein when he killed himself were charged with six 
counts of falsifying documents and conspiracy to defraud the U.S. The 
guards never checked on Epstein after 10:30 p.m. on Aug. 9 until he was 
discovered the next morning, according to the indictment. Instead, they 
searched the internet for furniture and motorcycle sales and sports news, 
prosecutors alleged, and "appeared to have been asleep" for two hours.

If you want a fat salary, move to Midland, Texas. According to Commerce 
Department data, the oil boom city's per capita personal income 
was $122,247 last year, higher than San Jose, San Francisco, Boston or 
New York. Not surprisingly, the riches drew people: The city led all metro 
areas in 2018 population growth with a 4.4% gain. But—fair warning—the 
good times may not last. A recent drop in local energy rigs has coincided 
with slower job growth, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas data shows.

Jeff and George, 
Thank you both very much for your assistance in response to our subpoenas seeking records from Interlochen. In 
reviewing the documents you produced in response to the attached subpoena, a follow-up question arose. Would 
you please confirm that your production included all records of any tuition payments that Epstein (or his entities) 
made for any students at Interlochen? 
Our team is also happy to discuss this inquiry over the phone if that would be useful. I am starting a trial tomorrow 
and will have limited availability this week, but my colleagues 
and

PRELIMINARY INSTRUCTIONS 
Please read the following instructions carefully before completing any portion of this 
questionnaire. Please print your juror number in the space provided at the top of each page. 
Do not write your name on the questionnaire. Please answer each and every question fully. 
Some questions have more than one part. 
YOU ARE SWORN TO GIVE TRUE AND COMPLETE ANSWERS TO ALL 
QUESTIONS IN THIS QUESTIONNAIRE. This questionnaire is designed to help simplify 
and shorten the jury selection process. The purpose of the questionnaire is to determine 
whether prospective jurors can decide this case impartially based upon the evidence presented 
at trial and the legal instructions given by the presiding judge. The questions are not intended 
to inquire unnecessarily into personal matters. Although some of the questions may appear to 
be of a personal nature, please understand that the Court and the parties must learn enough 
information about each juror's background and experiences to select a fair and impartial jury. 
Please answer all questions to the best of your ability. If you do not know the answer to a 
question then write, "I don't know." There are no "right" or "wrong" answers, only truthful 
answers. If you have strong feelings about this case in general, please do not hesitate to share 
them. Although you may be a perfectly good juror in another case, this may or may not be the 
right case for you to sit on as an impartial juror. Both parties have the right to get honest 
answers and to hear your true opinions. Do not discuss the case or your answers with anyone. 
It is important that the answers be yours alone. Remember, you are sworn to give true and 
complete answers to all questions. 
If you need extra space to answer any question, please use the extra blank sheets of paper 
included at the end of the questionnaire. Be sure to indicate on the blank page the number of 
the question you are answering. Do not write anything on the back of any page. 
DO NOT DISCUSS YOUR QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS OR THE CASE WITH 
ANYONE, NOW OR UNTIL FURTHER INSTRUCTED BY THE COURT. You should 
not discuss the questions or answers with fellow jurors. It is very important that your answers 
be your own individual answers. More broadly, do not discuss the case with anyone, including 
the lawyers (except in the presence of the Court), your fellow jurors, your family, your friends, 
or anyone else. Do not communicate about the case in any way, including telephone, e-mail, 
any social media app or website (such as Facebook), any communications app or website (such 
as Twitter). You must also avoid reading or hearing about the case (or anyone participating in 
the case) in newspapers, in magazines, on the radio or television, or on the Internet. 
DO NOT DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH ON THE CASE. Do not conduct any research 
into the case (or anyone participating in the case) at any time before your entire jury service 
has been completed. That includes performing Internet searches, asking other people about 
the case, reading news stories, books, or reports about the case, or watching films or television 
programs that relate to the case. Do not read, watch, or listen to any information about this 
case.

Your name will not be disclosed or connected to this questionnaire beyond the Judge and the 
parties in this case. However, if you believe that any of your answers contain private 
information that could embarrass you or otherwise seriously compromise your privacy and 
wish to request that the Court keep them confidential and not distribute them beyond the Judge 
and parties, please indicate the particular question number at the end of the questionnaire. 
SUMMARY OF THE CASE 
The Court is selecting a jury for a trial commencing on Monday, November 29, 2021. 
Although it is never possible to predict the length of a trial, currently this trial is expected 
to last approximately six weeks. 
This is a criminal case. The Defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell, has been charged in an Indictment 
with various criminal offenses. The Indictment is not evidence. It simply contains the 
charges—referred to as "counts"—that the Government intends to prove to the jury at trial 
beyond a reasonable doubt. 
The charges in the Indictment stem from allegations that from at least 1994 through 2004, the 
Defendant conspired with and aided and abetted Jeffrey Epstein to entice minors to travel to 
engage in criminal sexual activity, to transport minors to engage in criminal sexual activity, 
and to engage in sex trafficking of a minor. 
The Indictment charges the Defendant in 6 counts: Count One of the Indictment charges the 
Defendant with conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein and others to entice minors to travel to engage 
in sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense. Count Two 
charges the Defendant with enticing a minor to travel to engage in sexual activity for which a 
person can be charged with a criminal offense, and aiding and abetting the same. Count Three 
charges the Defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to transport minors to engage 
in sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense. Count Four 
charges the Defendant with transporting a minor to engage in sexual activity for which a person 
can be charged with a criminal offense, and aiding and abetting the same. Count Five charges 
the Defendant with participating in a sex trafficking conspiracy. Count Six charges the 
Defendant with sex trafficking of a minor, and aiding and abetting the same. 
Ms. Maxwell has pled not guilty to all charges. Ms. Maxwell is presumed innocent, and before 
she can be found guilty on any charge, the jury must find that the Government has proven each 
element of that crime beyond a reasonable doubt.

SCHEDULE 
Potential jurors will be called back for further questioning and jury selection from 
Tuesday, November 16, 2021, through Friday, November 19, 2021. Your availability 
during that week will be required. 
The trial will commence on Monday, November 29, 2021. The trial is expected to last 
about six weeks. Generally, trial will be held five days per week, Monday through Friday, 
from 9:30 a.m. until 5:00 p.m. Trial will not be held on Friday, December 24, 2021 
(Christmas Eve Day) and December 31, 2021 (New Year's Eve). 
If you are selected as a juror, you will be required to be present for the taking of testimony and 
evidence for as long as the trial lasts. There are no plans to sequester the jury, which means 
you will go home every day after court. 
All jury service involves some degree of hardship. Our court and justice system depends on 
citizens doing their civic duty to serve as jurors, which involves temporarily putting aside their 
regular business for jury service. The Court views service on a jury to be one of the highest 
duties a citizen owes to the United States. Mere inconvenience or the usual financial hardship 
of jury service will not be sufficient to excuse a prospective juror. 
You must show 
extraordinary personal or financial hardship to be excused from service.

BASIC LEGAL PRINCIPLES AND MEDIA RESTRICTIONS 
9. 
9a. 
Under the law, the facts are for the July to determine and the law is for the Judge to 
determine. You are required to accept the law as the Judge explains it to you even if 
you do not like the law or disagree with it, and you must determine the facts 
according to those instructions. Do you accept this principle, and will you be able to 
follow the Judge's instructions if selected to serve on this jury? 
o Yes 
o No 
10. 
If no, please explain: 
The law provides that a defendant in a criminal case is presumed innocent at all 
stages of the trial and is not required to put on any defense at all. The Government 
is required to prove the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt on each charge. 
Do you accept these principles, and will you be able to apply them if selected to 
serve on this jury? 
o Yes 
o No 
10a. 
If no, please explain:

EFTA00032830

Juror ID: 
I. 
a. 
The law provides that a defendant in a criminal case has an absolute right not to 
testify, and that a juror cannot hold it against the defendant if she chooses not to 
testify. Do you accept this principle, and will you be able to apply it if selected to 
serve on this jury? 
o Yes 
o No 
If no, please explain: 
12. 
A juror is required by law to make his or her decision based solely on the evidence 
or lack of evidence presented in Court, and not on the basis of conjecture, suspicion, 
bias, sympathy, or prejudice. Do you accept this principle, and will you be able to 
apply it if selected to serve on this jury? 
o Yes 
o No 
I 2a. 
If no, please explain: 
13. 
Under the law, the question of punishment is for the Court alone to decide, and thus 
the issue of punishment must not enter into your deliberations as to whether the 
defendant is guilty or not guilty as charged. Do you accept this principle, and will 
you be able to apply it if selected to serve on this jury? 
o Yes 
o No 
I 3a. 
If no, please explain:

evidence from searches. The Court will instruct you that those searches were legal 
and that the evidence obtained from those searches is admissible in this case. Do 
you have any feelings or opinions about searches conducted by law enforcement 
officers, or the use of evidence obtained from searches, that would affect your 
ability to be fair and impartial in this case? 
o Yes 
o No 
I 4a. 
If yes, please explain: 
15. 
You also may hear testimony in this case from expert witnesses. Have you had any 
experiences with experts, or do you have any general feelings about the use of 
experts, that would affect your ability to be fair and impartial in this case? 
o Yes 
o No 
I 5a. 
If yes, please explain: 
16. 
As instructed above, from now and until your jury service is complete, you are 
instructed to avoid all media coverage and not to go on the Internet with regard to 
this case for any purpose. That is, you are forbidden from consuming any news 
media or social media, or any discussion of this case (or of anyone participating in 
the case) outside of the courtroom whatsoever. You also must not discuss this case 
with anyone. This includes your family, friends, spouse, domestic partner, 
colleagues, and co-workers. These instructions apply from now and until you are 
either dismissed from jury selection or chosen as a juror and the trial is complete.

have followed this instruction. 
Do you have any reservations or concerns about your ability or willingness to 
follow this instruction?

Is there a time early next week that we might be able to meet with one or both of you to talk about forfeiture theories 
for certain Epstein properties? I know that we've talked about this in some detail already, but currently counsel for the 
Trustees of his estate are working on thinking about the value of the government's potential claims, in particular relating 
to statute of limitations issues, so we want to make sure we have the best possible arguments to present to them. Sorry

Defendants charged with tax offenses moved to dismiss

affirmative decision to invoke "taint team" procedures 
with regard to handling potentially privileged documents 
was per se intentional intrusion upon defendants' 
attorney-client privilege, but (2) government successfully 
rebutted presumption of harm arising from its decision to 
use "taint team" procedures. 
Motion to dismiss denied; motion to supplement record

Pending before the Court is the defendants' Motion to 
Dismiss due to the Government's Invasion of Their 
Attorney—Client Privilege ("Motion to Dismiss"). After 
determining that the defendants had made the requisite 
preliminary showing under United States v. Kelly 790

evidentiary hearing on this issue. See United States v.

U.S. v. Neill, 952 F.Supp. 834 (1997) 
Neill, Memorandum Op. at 21 & 24 (JHG) (D.D.C. Oct. 
10, 1996). Upon consideration of the evidence introduced 
and testimony offered at the evidentiary hearing, in light 
of the credibility and demeanor of the witnesses, as well 
as the in camera submissions offered by both parties,' 
their post-hearing briefs and the entire record in this 
matter, the Motion to Dismiss will be denied. 
L Findings of Fact 
On October 27, 1993, federal agents executed four search 
warrants at the office of Neill and Company, and the 
homes of Defendants James and Denis Neill. On October 
28th, a fifth warrant was executed to search Defendant 
James Neill's safe deposit box at Columbia First Bank in 
Washington, D.C. See Mem.Op. at 1-5. Approximately 
sixty boxes of materials were 
seized, including 
computers, computer files and data. Id. at 6. The seized 
items were stored in a locked space at the IRS Office, 500 
N. Capitol St., N.E., Washington, D.C. 
While the affidavits to the search warrants and the search 
execution memorandum stated that the federal agents 
were not to seize documents on the letterhead of the 
defendants' attorneys, these "letterhead documents" were 
in fact seized over the oral and written objections of the 
defendants.= The agents also seized other documents that 
were not "letterhead documents" but some of which were 
later claimed to be protected by attorney-client privilege. 
In that the search warrants authorized the search of a law 
office as well as the home of *837 Denis Neill, a lawyer, 
the government provided measures to minimize the 
potential intrusion upon the attorney-client privilege. FBI 
agent attorneys were directed to serve as Principal Legal 
Advisers ("PLA's") on site to review all potentially 
privileged documents prior to seizure. See Mem.Op. at 6 
(quoting Search Execution Memorandum of Oct. 19, 
1993). The Search Execution Memorandum provided that 
"search team members, with the advice of PLA's as 
appropriate, should segregate and place in sealed 
envelopes or separate boxes, items that may be subject to 
the attorney-client privilege. This includes any items 
which occupants of the search locations claim are 
privileged." Id. (quoting Search Execution Mem. at 2). 
The seizure of potentially privileged documents was 
handled differently at different search sites. At Denis 
Neill's home, after offering Denis Neill's counsel the 
option of sealing the materials for off-site review or of 
having the PLA conduct an immediate on-site review in 
counsel's presence, counsel (over standing objection) 
selected the latter. The PLA then reviewed each document 
for which counsel claimed privilege, seizing some and 
returning others to counsel. At the offices of Neill & 
Company, without reviewing the potentially privileged 
materials in James Neill's seized briefcase, the PLA 
sealed those materials. At no time did the defendants' 
counsel seek judicial intervention or file a motion for a 
protective order. Nor did counsel ever file a motion under 
Fed.R.Crim.P. 41(e). 
Because materials asserted to be subject to the 
attorney-client privilege had been seized, on October 
28th, Deputy Chief of the Fraud Section Peter Clark 
directed trial attorney Elisabethanne Stevens and her 
supervisor, Barbara Corprew, to review those materials. 
Stevens and Corprew formed what the Department of 
Justice called a "taint team," meaning that their actions 
would be "walled off" from the prosecution team thereby 
ensuring that the prosecution team remained free of the 
"taint" arising from exposure to potentially privileged 
material. Stevens and Corprew's mandate was to review 
documents 
for 
which 
the 
defendants 
claimed 
attorney-client 
privilege, 
determine 
whether 
the 
crime-fraud exception might be applicable, and, if 
necessary, litigate the existence of the privilege or the 
application of the crime-fraud exception! On October 
29th, before he met with the defendants' counsel, 
prosecutor Richard Poole (Senior Trial Attorney, Fraud 
Section) was advised that Ms. Stevens would act in this 
capacity. 
On November I, 1993, the defendants' counsel met with 
Poole to voice their objections to the seizure of materials 
for which they claimed privilege and to demand the return 
of the same.' While the defendants' counsel contend that 
the government promised to return without review any 
documents seized contrary to the search affidavits and 
Search Execution Memorandum, Poole recalled telling 
counsel that such documents would be returned, but only 
after review by someone other than a "prosecution team" 
member: "We discussed the fact that the fraud section had 
identified a review team who would be looking at the 
issues 
raised 
by 
the 
claims of privilege 
and 
would—would be responsible for resolving them, 
including litigation." Hearing Transcript ("Transcript") at 
(Vol. I—B).6
In a follow-up letter, the defendants' counsel requested 
the return of thirteen items, none of which they claimed 
were privileged but which were of a personal nature to the 
defendants or their family. See Joseph •838 Jones' letter 
of Nov. 4, 1993, at 1-2, Defendants' Exhibit ("DE") # 5. 
The letter also stated: 
With regard to the privileged items, 
we propose to designate someone

from our office to immediately 
review these items with Attorney 
Elisabeth (sic) Stevens of your 
office in order to segregate those 
items which were clearly seized in 
contravention of your instructions 
to 
seize 
no 
correspondence, 
memoranda, etc., emanating from 
our offices or those of James 
Neill's counsel, Martha P. Rogers, 
Esq. There may be other materials 
which 
are 
privileged 
communications between Denis or 
James Neill as clients, and others 
(sic) attorneys." Id. at 2.' 
On November 2nd, Stevens received two boxes which 
included materials that the defendants claimed were 
protected by 
the attorney-client privilege. While 
Defendant Denis Neill's counsel did not designate anyone 
pursuant to his letter of November 4th until approximately 
one month later, Stevens was contacted directly by 
Defendant James Neill's counsel, Martha Rogers, on 
November 3, 1993. Rogers demanded the return of the 
materials in James Neill's briefcase. She testified that she 
was advised by Stevens that such materials would be 
returned without review as soon as they were located. 
However, Stevens testified that on or about November 
8th, she advised Rogers that she would be reviewing those 
documents before she could make a determination 
whether they should be returned. Still, the defendants 
made no request for judicial intervention. 
During the course of the next several months, Stevens and 
Corprew reviewed the initial delivery of potentially 
privileged materials as well as other potentially privileged 
documents later discovered among the seized items. In 
two instances, IRS Special Agent Fort, a member of the 
prosecution team, discovered documents that were 
marked "attorney-client" privilege among the seized 
items' Fort testified that, on or about December I, 1993, 
after one of the defendants' counsel had reviewed the 
seized materials and made an inventory, see Transcript at 
& 104 (Vol. I-B), he began reviewing the materials. 
While going through a three-ring binder, he happened 
upon a tab that was labeled "Earl Glock—Attomey/Client." 
After opening the notebook to the tab, he discovered what 
appeared to him to be a legal opinion. He then removed 
that section, without reading the potentially privileged 
material, sealed the document and delivered it to Stevens. 
See Transcript at 80-86 (Vol. I-B). Agent Brown, who 
was present when Fort discovered and sealed the 
document:, corroborated Fort's testimony. See Transcript 
at 84-85 (Vol. II—B). Fort testified persuasively that he 
neither showed the document to Poole nor did he discuss 
what he may have gleaned of its content or even the fact 
of its existence. See Transcript at 86 (Vol. I—B). The 
document was later returned to the defendants by Stevens. 
Another set of potentially privileged materials was 
discovered by Fort on or about January 24, 1994. Fort 
testified that while again reviewing documents that had 
already been inspected and inventoried by defense 
counsel, he opened a manila envelope for Federal City 
National Bank which included documents that were 
labeled as "attorney/client privileged." See Transcript at 
(Vol. I—B). Fort testified that he did not •839 show the 
documents to anyone or read them. See id. at 87-88 & 
101. Instead, he immediately sealed them and then gave 
the sealed materials to Brown, who delivered them to 
Stevens. See Transcript at 101 (Vol. I—B); Transcript at 
84-86 (Vol. II-B). 
Eventually, all of the documents for which the defendants 
asserted attorney-client privilege were returned to their 
counsel. It is undisputed that Stevens and Corprew read 
those materials. However, neither the evidence at the 
hearing nor the in camera submission of over two boxes 
of electronic mail messages and other documents indicate 
that any privileged information flowed from the taint team 
to the prosecution team. Instead, the record and in camera 
materials reflect that Stevens and Corprew clearly 
appreciated the need for isolating their review from the 
prosecution and took steps on numerous occasions to 
ensure that the substantive information in potentially 
privileged documents was protected. Only those materials 
for which attorney-client privilege was not asserted were 
released to the prosecution team, and the record 
demonstrates that this was done only after the defendants 
were provided notice and an opportunity to claim 
privilege. 
In the course of their assignment, Stevens and Corprew 
did not review the potentially privileged data that was 
stored electronically. Unlike the letterhead documents and 
other materials that were seized, however, there is no 
evidence demonstrating that the defendants ever asserted 
a claim of attorney-client privilege with respect to the 
computer material. See, e.g., Transcript at 107-08 (Vol. 
II-B). Nevertheless, in May and June of 1996, the 
government established a computer "taint team." It 
assigned Agent Ray Smith to download the files and 
Agent Harvey Barlow to review them for materials that 
were 
potentially 
privileged. 
See 
Government's 
Supplemental Submission Regarding Issues Arising from 
the Search Warrants, at App. 2. Potentially privileged 
materials were deleted from the files prior to providing 
the prosecution team with computer disks containing the 
seized electronic files. While it is undisputed that the 
prosecution team had access to the computers and

electronic files, the agents testified persuasively that they 
did not access those files, and them is no evidence to the 
contrary. Significantly, two prosecution team members 
testified at the hearing that they lacked computer skills.

II. Conclusions of Law 
hl PI A criminal defendant is guaranteed the right to the 
effective assistance of counsel. McMann v. Richardson, 
397 U.S. 759, 771, 90 S.Ct. 1441, 1449, 25 L.Ed.2d 763 
(1970); Coplon v. United States, 191 F.2d 749, 757 
(D.C.Cir.1951), cert. denied, 342 U.S. 926, 72 S.Ct. 363, 
L.Ed. 690 (1952). The attorney-client privilege, while 
it has not been elevated to the level of a constitutional 
right, see, e.g., United States v. White, 970 F.2d 328, 336 
(7th Cir.1992), is key to the constitutional guarantees of 
the right to effective assistance of counsel and a fair trial. 
Coplon, 191 F.2d at 757. To provide effective assistance, 
a lawyer must be able to communicate freely without fear 
that his or her advice and legal strategy will be seized and 
used against the client in a criminal proceeding. See 
United States v. Levy, 577 F.2d 200, 209 (3rd Cir.1978); 
United States v. Rosner, 485 F.2d 1213, 1224 (2nd 
Cir.1973), cert. denied, 417 U.S. 950, 94 S.Ct 3080, 41 
L.Ed.2d 672 (1974). One of the principal purposes of the 
attorney-client privilege is to promote the free and open 
exchange between the attorney and client, see Fisher v. 
United States, 425 U.S. 391, 403, 96 S.Ct. 1569, 1577, 48 
L.Ed.2d 39 (1976), and substantial questions of 
fundamental fairness are raised where, in connection with 
a criminal prosecution, the government invades that 
privilege. It matters little whether the intrusion occurred 
prior to the initiation of formal adversary proceedings, see 
Kirby v. Illinois, 406 U.S. 682, 689, 92 S.Ct. 1877, 1882, 
L.Ed.2d 411 (1972), because the right to a fair trial 
could be crippled by government interference with the 
attorney-client 
privilege 
long 
before 
the 
formal 
commencement of a criminal proceeding. 
PI I 1
151 "An independent judiciary and a sacrosanct 
confidential relationship between lawyer and client are 
the bastions of an ordered liberty." Edna Selan Epstein, 
The Attorney—Client Privilege and the Work— *840 
Product Doctrine 2 (3rd ed. 1997). Nonetheless, not every 
intrusion on the attorney-client privilege constitutes a 
constitutional violation. Under Weatherford v. Bursey, 
429 U.S. 545, 554, 97 S.Ct. 837, 843, 51 L.Ed.2d 30 
(1977), an intrusion may result in a constitutional 
violation if privileged information is intentionally 
obtained and used to the defendant's detriment at trial. 
Where government agents acquire privileged information, 
but do not communicate that information to the 
prosecutors, there is no Sixth Amendment violation. Id. at 
555, 97 S.Ct. at 843-44; see United States v. Kelly, 790 
F.2d 130, 137 (D.C.Cir.1986). While there is a 
presumption that the information is conveyed to the 
prosecution team, Briggs v. Goodwin, 698 F.2d 486, 495 
(D.C.Cir.1983), vacated on other grounds, 712 F.2d 1444, 
cert. denied, 464 U.S. 1040, 104 S.Ct. 704, 79 L.Ed.2d 
169 (1984), the government may rebut that presumption 
by showing the existence of suitable safeguards, id. at 495 
n. 29, or by demonstrating that "there will be no prejudice 
to the defendants as a result of these communications." 
United States v. Mastroianni, 749 F.2d 900, 908 (1st 
Cir.I984). See generally Note, Government Intrusions 
into the Defense Camp: Undermining the Right to 
Counsel, 97 Harv.L.Rev. 1143, 1150 (1984). 
161 Under Weatherford and Kelly, four factors are relevant 
as to whether an alleged intrusion into the attorney-client 
privilege offends the Constitution: (1) whether evidence 
to be used at trial was obtained directly or indirectly by 
the government intrusion; (2) whether the intrusion was 
intentional; (3) whether the prosecution received 
otherwise confidential information about trial preparation 
or defense strategy as a result of the intrusion; and (4) 
whether the privileged information was used or will be 
used to the substantial detriment of the defendants. 
Weatherford, 429 U.S. at 558, 97 S.Ct. at 845; Kelly, 790 
F.2d at 137. While neither the Supreme Court nor this 
Circuit have yet explained how these factors are to be 
weighed, and the other circuits remain split, see Kelly, 
790 F.2d at 137 & n. 5, it is clear that there must a 
substantial demonstration of prejudice 
before an 
indictment can be dismissed. See United States v. 
Morrison, 449 U.S. 361, 365, 101 S.Ct. 665, 668, 66 
L.Ed.2d 564 (1981). 
In this case, there can be no doubt that the government 
intentionally invaded the attorney-client privilege. The 
government all but concedes that materials subject to the 
privilege were reviewed during the execution of the 
search warrant and more were seized and sealed.'0
Stevens, an attorney assigned to the Department of 
Justice's Fraud Section, testified that she read most (but 
not all) of the potentially privileged materials to 
determine whether the crime-fraud exception applied. 
Moreover, at least one agent, PLA Rebecca Granger, read 
materials for which Defendant Denis Neill's counsel 
asserted privilege during the search of Denis Neill's 
home!, These intrusions were not accidental; they were 
deliberate and intentional."

sanctioned the Department of Justice's "taint team"

U.S. v. Neill, 952 F.Supp. 834 (1997) 
procedures," it is clear that the government's affirmative 
decision to *841 invoke these procedures constitutes a per 
se intentional intrusion. See Weatherford, 429 U.S. at 558, 
S.Ct. at 845; Kelly, 790 F.2d at 137." Where the 
government chooses to take matters into its own hands 
rather than using the more traditional alternatives of 
submitting disputed documents under seal for in camera 
review by a neutral and detached magistrate or by 
court-appointed special masters, see, e.g., United States v. 
Zolin, 491 U.S. 554, 570-71, 109 S.Ct. 2619, 2629-30, 
105 L.Ed.2d 469 (1989); In re Grand July Proceedings, 
867 F.2d 539, 540 (9th Cir.1989); In re Impounded Case, 
840 F.2d 196, 202 (3rd Cir.I988); In re Berkley and 
Company, 629 F.2d 548, 550 (8th Cir.1980); United 
States v. Osborn, 561 F.2d 1334, 1338-39 (9th Cir. 1977); 
In re Subpoena Addressed to Murphy 560 F.2d 326, 331 
(8th Cir.1977); Hartford Assocs. v. United States, 792 
F.Supp. 358, 367 (D.N.J.1992), it bears the burden to 
rebut the presumption that tainted material was provided 
to the prosecution team. Briggs, 698 F.2d at 495 n. 29 
("The government is, of course, free to rebut this 
presumption, by showing, for example, procedures in 
place 
to 
prevent 
such 
intragovemmental 
communications."). 
191 However, an intrusion into the attorney-client privilege, 
standing alone, does not per se violate the Constitution. If 
the government demonstrates that no harm, that is, no 
privileged 
information regarding trial 
strategy or 
otherwise has been communicated to the prosecutors and 
used to the defendants' detriment, there is no 
constitutional violation. Weatherford, 429 U.S. at 558, 97 
S.Ct. at 845; Kelly 790 F.2d at 137. In this instance, 
based upon the evidence and testimony offered at the 
evidentiary 
hearing, 
including the demeanor and 
credibility of the witnesses as well as the Court's review 
of voluminous materials submitted under seal for in 
camera inspection and the entire record in this matter, the 
Court is satisfied that the government has carried its 
burden to rebut the presumption of harm. 
First, the government took precautions to shield the 
prosecution team from viewing potentially privileged 
materials during the execution of the search warrants. 
Only Agent Fort was present during the searches and then 
only for a short time. Fort testified persuasively that he 
did not read the content of any potentially privileged 
materials, and his testimony was not undermined on 
cross-examination or through other evidence. Second, the 
prosecution team witnesses testified that, to their 
knowledge, they received no privileged information from 
the agents who may have been exposed to potentially 
privileged materials, such as Agent Granger, the PLA on 
site during the search of Defendant Denis Neill's home. 
Finally, the taint team took sufficient precautions to 
ensure that the prosecution team did not have access to 
the potentially privileged documents or become aware of 
the content of those materials. When potentially 
privileged materials were later inadvertently discovered 
among the sixty boxes of seized items by Agent Fort, a 
prosecution team member, he acted responsibly by sealing 
the materials without reading them. He then had them 
delivered to the taint team for review. 
The defendants contended at the evidentiary hearing 
(generally through bench conferences the transcripts of 
which have been sealed) that the government acquired 
information that will be used to their detriment. However, 
based on the Court's independent review of the 
defendants' sealed filing for in camera review (and 
contrary to the defendants' assertion), there is no evidence 
that the government acquired the defendants' trial theories 
or strategy. Compare Levy, 577 F.2d at 210 ("actual 
disclosure of defense strategy"). 
IrW 1"l At most, the potentially privileged materials 
reviewed by the government contained facts identifying 
entities and persons. *842 CI Upjohn Co. v. United 
States, 449 U.S. 383, 395-96, 101 S.Ct. 677, 685-86, 66 
L.Ed.2d 584 (1981) (distinguishing between protection 
provided to attorney-client communications and facts 
underlying 
those 
communications). 
While 
factual 
disclosures enabling the government to better investigate 
its case could rise to the level of a Sixth Amendment 
violation if substantial, see United States v. Castor, 937 
F.2d 293, 297 (7th Cir.1991), the disclosure of facts is 
presumptively less harmful than the disclosure of trial 
strategy. Here the government has demonstrated to the 
Court's satisfaction that no privileged information, factual 
or otherwise, flowed from the taint team to the 
prosecution team. Consequently, there is no evidence of a 
harmful disclosure resulting from the taint team's review. 
The only information that the prosecution team may 
possibly have acquired arose from Agent Fort's 
inadvertent discovery of Earl Clock's identity. After the 
defendants' counsel 
reviewed the 
materials, 
Fort 
discovered the notebook with a tab marked "Earl 
GlockJAttorney-Client."" The inadvertent disclosure of 
this fact does not constitute constitutional harm. 
In sum, the Court has not seen any potentially privileged 
materials that were seized and presumably" reviewed by 
the government and which can reasonably be construed as 
trial strategy. While some factual information was 
reviewed by the taint team, the record in this matter, 
including the in camera submissions, indicates that none 
flowed to the prosecution team. Agent Fort's discovery of 
the tab identifying "Earl Clock/Attorney—Client" can only 
be characterized as inadvertent. The defendants' argument 
that the government derived its factual knowledge from

U.S. v. Neill, 952 F.Supp. 834 (1997) 
material protected by the attorney-client privilege is based 
on bare speculation, and, for the reasons stated above, it is 
rejected. 
li n " 31 As to the computer files, the defendants' charge 
fails at the outset simply because they have not shown 
that they asserted the attorney-client privilege with 
respect to those materials. The proponent of the privilege 
bears the burden to establish its existence, United States v. 
(Under Seal), 748 F.2d 871, 876 (4th Cir.I 984); United 
States v. Covington & Burling, 430 F.Supp. 1117, 1122 
(D.D.C.I 977), and absent the timely assertion of 
attorney-client privilege for each specific communication 
or document, no privilege will be recognized. United 
States v. White, 970 F.2d 328, 334 (7th Cir. I 992). Since 
there is no evidence of such an assertion by the 
defendants, it is unsurprising that neither Stevens nor 
Corprew were asked to review computer files. Indeed, 
Stevens testified that she was unaware of the existence of 
these files. Nonetheless, even though there was no claim 
of attorney-client 
privilege, 
the 
government 
did 
implement a computer taint team to review files on 
computer disks." Absent the timely assertion of privilege, 
the defendants cannot now complain. 
Ill. Defendant's Motion to Supplement the Record 
Over a month after the conclusion of the evidentiary 
hearing, the defendants filed a motion to Compel 
Production and to Supplement the Record of the 
November 4-5, 1996 Evidentiary Hearing ("Motion to 
Supplement the Record"). At the hearing, the Court 
consistently denied the defendants' request *843 that the 
government be required to produce to the defendants 
copies of the 
government's internal memoranda, 
electronic mail and other materials which would reveal 
the government's deliberations. However, in response to 
the defendants' repeated requests, the Court eventually 
ordered the government to produce certain internal 
documents for in camera review. The government did so, 
to the tune of two very full boxes of materials which 
document the taint team's actions and trace internal 
Department of Justice communications to and from 
Stevens and Corprew)2 The Court is not persuaded that 
additional disclosures are justified or that supplementation 
Footnotes 
would be helpful to resolving the Motion to Dismiss. 
NI The defendants support their motion by arguing 
fairness and noting specifically that the Court granted the 
government's request to supplement the record with a 
memorandum from Michael Shaheen of the Department 
of Justice's Office of Professional Responsibility. See 
Order of December 9, 1996. The Shaheen memorandum 
simply reflects his finding that the Fraud Section engaged 
in no misconduct), While the defendants did not object to 
the 
government's 
motion 
to file 
the 
Shaheen 
memorandum, the Court notes that this document was 
already available to her as part of Ms. Corprew's files, 
which were submitted for in camera review based upon 
the defendants' request at the evidentiary hearing. By 
granting the government's unopposed motion, the Court 
merely ensured that the Shaheen memorandum was also 
available to the defendants. The Court's Order of 
December 9th simply establishes no equitable ground 
upon which to grant the Motion to Supplement the 
Record. 
In sum, the parties were provided a sufficient opportunity 
to develop the evidentiary record, and the defendants' 
request for disclosure of additional materials will be 
denied. 
IV. Conclusion 
Accordingly, it is hereby 
ORDERED that the defendants' Motion to Dismiss is 
denied; and it is 
FURTHER ORDERED that the defendants' Motion to 
Supplement the Record is denied. 
IT IS SO ORDERED.

U.S. v. Neill, 952 F.Supp. 834 (1997) 
Two categories of potentially privileged documents have been discussed in the course of litigating this motion: (1) communications 
between the defendants and their counsel, which in the context of this criminal proceeding have constitutional significance; and (2) 
communications between Denis Neill, as a lawyer, and his clients (including Kamel Fatah), which while such communications 
may be privileged, they have no constitutional significance here. 
No litigation directly resulted from the taint team's review because the defendants never filed any motions for a protective order or 
under Rule 41(e) and because the government never contested the applicability of the attorney-client privilege or raised the 
crime-fraud exception. 
IRS Special Agent Sherry Brown also attended the meeting. Her contemporaneous notes were introduced into evidence at the 
evidentiary hearing. See Defendants' Exhibit # 7. 
Poole further testified that he "told them that the prosecution team would not review any of the documents as to which claims of 
privilege had been raised until those questions were resolved." Transcript at 75 (Vol. I—B). While it is possible, as the defendants 
contend, that as of the November I, 1993, meeting, the prosecutor intended to return the letterhead documents without review, 
whether he did so intend but later changed his mind is not relevant to disposition of the instant motion. 
This letter does not appear to be the "smoking gun" that the government contends. While it could be construed, as the government 
argues, to reflect defense counsel's acknowledgment that all potentially privileged materials would be reviewed, it can also be 
reasonably construed to reflect counsel's understanding that he was to designate someone to assist in the segregation of 
"letterhead" documents from other materials so that the former could be returned without review by the government. Nevertheless, 
it is unnecessary to resolve this dispute in order to resolve the instant motion. 
The defendants also challenge Fort's presence during the search of the office of Neill and Company on October 27, 1993. 
However, Fon denied reviewing any documents during the search or discussing the contents of any documents with the seizing 
agents, see Transcript at 80-81 (Vol. I-B), and the defendants have offered no evidence to the contrary. 
Agent Brown testified that Fort wanted her to witness that, upon finding the potentially privileged materials, he sealed them 
immediately and did not read them. Transcript at 84 (Vol. II-B). 
The government consistently contended at the hearing that the materials were only "potentially" privileged. However, the decisions 
by the taint team to return to the defendants those documents for which the defendants asserted privilege, and to release to the 
prosecution team only those for which the defendants did not claim privilege, does more than imply concession. 
I I 
Neither side called Agent Granger to testify at the evidentiary hearing. 
On the other hand, the discoveries by Agent Fort are most fairly characterized as inadvertent since he happened upon potentially 
privileged materials after defense counsel had reviewed the boxes containing seized material. Fort testified that he was surprised to 
find this material because, in fact, defense counsel and support staff had already inspected and inventoried the materials. 
Although the more traditional approach is to submit contested materials for in camera review by a neutral and detached magistrate 
(for obvious reasons), the case law regarding the government's "taint team" approach is equivocal. Compare In re Search Warrant 
for Law Offices, 153 F.R.D. 55 (S.D.N.Y.I 994) (criticizing "walling" in review of disputed attorney-client materials) with United 
States v. Noriegp 764 F.Supp. 1480 (S.D.Fla.1991) (finding no Sixth Amendment violation where the government agent reviewing 
monitored attorney-client conversations was 'walled off' from prosecutors). 
This decision is troubling indeed, and there is no doubt that, at the very least, the "taint team" procedures create an appearance of 
unfairness. However unwise this policy decision may be, absent a showing of harm, it does not offend the Constitution. While this 
Court is critical of the government's use of the "taint team" procedure, that criticism is not intended to carry over to the individual 
attorneys who were assigned to perform as part of the taint team. The record reflects that these attorneys appreciated the sensitivity 
of their assignments and took affirmative measures to ensure that no breach of the "walls" actually occurred. 
I5 
In cross-examining the prosecution team members at the evidentiary hearing, the defendants contended that the government 
acquired factual information identifying certain persons and business entities. However, with the exception of Earl Glock (who was 
identified in a document discovered inadvertently), the government witnesses persuasively testified that those entities were known 
to the investigators prior to the search. This testimony was not surprising. The investigation of the Neills and their business 
activities dates to at least 1991, and the abundant record in this matter indicates that the scope of the investigation (even prior to the 
searches of October 27, 1993) was wide ranging indeed.

U.S. v. NOM, 952 F.Supp. 834 (1997) 
As noted previously, Stevens returned certain documents without review based upon Roger's representations on or about 
November 15, 1993. 
The testimony at the hearing indicated that some of the files were printed and read by at least Agent Fort prior to the computer taint 
team's review. Nevertheless, even though the defendants knew that the government had seized the electronic data and equipment, 
they have not demonstrated that they asserted their attorney-client privilege with respect to any material stored electronically. 
The communications were not limited to those between Stevens and Corprew. 
While interesting, Mr. Shaheen's ethics determination for departmental employees bears little, if any, relevance to the 
constitutional analysis under Weatherfred and Kelly.

Names To Watch As Biden Mulls Next SDNY Top 
Prosecutor 
By Pete Brush

EFTA00032872

Law360, New York (February 10, 2021, 5:41 
PM EST) -- President Joe Biden is ramping 
up the process of choosing new top federal 
prosecutors across the country, and while he 
may not rush to replace Manhattan U.S. 
Attorney Audrey Strauss, lawyers have their 
eye on a handful of her potential successors. 
The application process to helm the U.S. 
Attorney's Office for the Southern District of 
New York, a process that court-watchers say 
is active and includes a large pool of 
candidates, comes as the Biden 
administration begins the work of replacing 
U.S. attorneys appointed by former President 
Donald Trump, who have all been asked to 
step down. 
But the president may not hurry to replace 
Strauss, who in December was formally 
appointed as U.S. attorney by federal judges 
amid the chaos of the outgoing Trump 
administration. 
Strauss, who of late has brought high-profile 
cases including sex-abuse charges against 
Jeffrey Epstein associate Ghislaine 
Maxwelland ex-fashion executive Peter 
Nygard, is well-regarded, and her presence 
leaves the White House the luxury of taking 
its time on SDNY if it wishes to prioritize 
dozens of other districts across the country. 
"She has a stellar reputation inside and 
outside the office," Pace Law School 
professor Bennett L. Gershman said of 
EFTA00032873
--- PAGE 3 ---
Strauss. 
Nevertheless the application process is 
underway in the Southern District, sources 
said, with Senate Majority Leader Chuck 
Schumer, D-N.Y., holding powerful sway over 
the process. Asked to handicap top possible 
successors, lawyers named three people: 
Damian 
Williams is a veteran SDNY 
prosecutor who heads the district's Securities 
and Commodities Fraud Task Force. He 
prosecuted former politicians Sheldon Silver 
and Chris Collins in recent years, and is 
widely regarded as a steadying presence 
inside the halls at 1 St. Andrew's Plaza. 
Williams, who would be the first Black person 
to head the office, is a former law clerk for 
D.C. Circuit Judge Merrick B. Garland, 
Biden's nominee for attorney general who is 
slated for a Feb. 22 confirmation hearing in 
the Senate. 
The Garland clerk chain, dozens strong, 
could be fertile ground for possible picks, 
lawyers said, on the theory that a pre-existing 
relationship with the man who likely will lead 
Biden's Department of Justice could be 
valuable. 
Katherine Goldstein 
A white collar partner at Akin Gump Strauss 
Hauer & Feld LLP, Katherine Goldstein is a 
former SDNY Securities and Commodities 
EFTA00032874
--- PAGE 4 ---
Fraud Task Force chief with a sharp legal 
mindwho has worked on modernizing and 
improving insider trading enforcement. She 
has handled a number of high-profile white 
collar fraud cases. 
After Strauss and Mary Jo White, who held 
the post from 1993 until 2002, Goldstein 
would be the third woman to take the job in its 
more-than 200 year history, if confirmed. 
Anjan Sahni 
Like Williams and Goldstein, Anjan Sahni, a 
WilmerHale white collar partner, is a former 
SDNY Securities and Commodities Fraud 
Task Force chief. 
Sahni, who is of South Asian descent, also is 
noted for his work on a defense team 
that won acquittal for Citigroup trader Rohan 
Ramchandani in a closely-watched forex-
rigging criminal trial. 
Williams, Goldstein and Sahni are all said to 
be friendly with, and have professional ties to, 
former Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet 
Bharara, who was fired by the Trump 
administration in 2017. Sources said Bharara 
has a direct line to Schumer as the 
application process unfolds.

Also based on our discussion earlier we'll be mindful of looking for domestic (or domestic-flagged) carrier flights, as well

Again in connection with the Epstein investigation, we'd like to please request permission to travel for approximately 
three days next week for meetings and interviews in West Palm Beach, Florida. As of now we tentatively expect to fly

Unfortunately we're still trying to pin down timing for interviewing the victims, so depending on the timing it will either 
be me and

http://ftersite.hIll.atmil/

contract. The Government reserves the right to inspect or test any supplies or services that have been tendered for acceptance. The

in contract price. The Government must exercise its postacceptance rights—
(I) Within a reasonable period of time after the defect was discovered or should have been discovered; and

weather, and delays of common carriers. The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing as soon as it is reasonably

EFTA00032888
--- PAGE 6 ---
15JA5419P00000377 Page 6 of 8 
occurrence with all reasonable dispatch, and shall promptly give written notice to the Contracting Officer of the cessation of such 
occurrence. 
(0 Termination for the Government's convenience. The Government reserves the right to terminate this contract, or any part hereof, 
for its sole convenience. In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall 
immediately cause any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor 
shall be paid a percentage of the contract price reflecting the percentage of the work performed prior to the notice of termination, 
plus reasonable charges that the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government, using its standard record keeping 
system, have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or 
contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor's records. The 
Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred that reasonably could have been avoided. 
(g) Termination for cause. The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by 
the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon 
request, with adequate assurances of future performance. In the event of termination for cause, the Government shall not be liable to 
the Contractor for any amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and 
all rights and remedies provided by law. If it is determined that the Government improperly terminated this contract for default, such 
termination shall be deemed a termination for convenience. 
(h) Warranty. The Contractor warrants and implies that the items delivered hereunder are merchantable and fit for use for the 
particular purpose described in this contract. 
52.213-2 Invoices (Apr 1984) 
The Contractor's invoices must be submitted before payment can be made. The Contractor will be paid on the basis of the invoice, 
which must state-
(a) The starting and ending dates of the subscription delivery; and 
(b) Either that orders have been placed in effect for the addressees required, or that the orders will be placed in effect upon receipt of 
payment. 
(End of clause) 
52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-System for Award Management (Oct 2018) 
(a) Method of payment. 
( 1) All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), except as provided in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this clause. As used in this clause, the term "EFT" refers to the funds transfer and may also include the payment 
information transfer. 
(2) In the event the Government is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to either—
(i)
 payment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or 
(ii) Request the Government to extend the payment due date until such time as the Government can make payment by EFT (but see 
paragraph (d) of this clause). 
(b) Contractor's EFT information. The Government shall make payment to the Contractor using the EFT information contained in 
the System for Award Management (SAM). In the event that the EFT information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible for 
providing the updated information to the SAM. 
(c) Mechanisms for EFT payment. The Government may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (AC!!) 
network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fedwire Transfer System. The rules 
governing Federal payments through the ACII are contained in 31 CFR Part 210. 
(d) Suspension of payment. If the Contractor's EFT information in the SAM is incorrect, then the Government need not make payment 
to the Contractor under this contract until correct EFT information is entered into the SAM; and any invoice or contract financing 
EFTA00032889
--- PAGE 7 ---
15JA5419P000003T/ Page 7 of 8 
request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms 
of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply. 
(e) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers. 
(I) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government used the Contractor's EFT information incorrectly, the 
Government remains responsible for—. 
(i) Making a correct payment; 
(ii) Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and 
(iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds. 
(2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractor's EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 
days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and--
(i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the 
Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or 
(ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment, and the provisions of 
paragraph (d) of this clause shall apply. 
(0 EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt 
payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date 
specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid 
date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System. 
(g) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims 
terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall register separately in 
the SAM and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. Notwithstanding any other requirement of this contract, 
payment to an ultimate recipient other than the Contractor, or a financial institution properly recognized under an assignment of claims 
pursuant to Subpart 32.8, is not permitted. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the 
Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper 
assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause. 
(h) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT 
information made by the Contractor's financial agent. 
(i) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is 
suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request 
the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the 
payment office is capable of executing. However, the Government does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery 
is available at any particular payment office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to the 
Government. If the Government makes payment by check in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, the Government shall mail 
the payment information to the remittance address contained in the SAM.

Names To Watch As Biden Mulls Next SDNY Top 
Prosecutor 
By Pete Brush 
Sent from my iPhone 
Share us on: 
Law360, New York (February 10, 2021, 5:41 
PM EST) -- President Joe Biden is ramping 
up the process of choosing new top federal 
prosecutors across the country, and while he 
may not rush to replace Manhattan U.S. 
Attorney Audrey Strauss, lawyers have their 
eye on a handful of her potential successors. 
The application process to helm the U.S. 
Attorneys Office for the Southern District of 
New York, a process that court-watchers say 
is active and includes a large pool of 
candidates, comes as the Biden 
administration begins the work of replacing 
U.S. attorneys appointed by former President 
Donald Trump, who have all been asked to 
step down. 
But the president may not hurry to replace 
Strauss, who in December was formally 
appointed as U.S. attorney by federal judges 
amid the chaos of the outgoing Trump 
administration. 
Strauss, who of late has brought high-profile 
cases including sex-abuse charges against 
Jeffrey Epstein associate Ghislaine 
Maxwelland ex-fashion executive Peter 
Nygard, is well-regarded, and her presence 
leaves the White House the luxury of taking 
its time on SDNY if it wishes to prioritize 
EFTA00032898
--- PAGE 3 ---
dozens of other districts across the country. 
"She has a stellar reputation inside and 
outside the office," Pace Law School 
professor Bennett L. Gershman said of 
Strauss. 
Nevertheless the application process is 
underway in the Southern District, sources 
said, with Senate Majority Leader Chuck 
Schumer, D-N.Y., holding powerful sway over 
the process. Asked to handicap top possible 
successors, lawyers named three people: 
Damian Williams 
Damian Williams is a veteran SDNY 
prosecutor who heads the district's Securities 
and Commodities Fraud Task Force. He 
prosecuted former politicians Sheldon Silver 
and Chris Collins in recent years, and is 
widely regarded as a steadying presence 
inside the halls at 1 St. Andrew's Plaza. 
Williams, who would be the first Black person 
to head the office, is a former law clerk for 
D.C. Circuit Judge Merrick B. Garland, 
Biden's nominee for attorney general who is 
slated for a Feb. 22 confirmation hearing in 
the Senate. 
The Garland clerk chain, dozens strong, 
could be fertile ground for possible picks, 
lawyers said, on the theory that a pre-existing 
relationship with the man who likely will lead 
Biden's Department of Justice could be 
valuable. 
EFTA00032899

Katherine Goldstein 
A white collar partner at Akin Gump Strauss 
Hauer & Feld LLP, Katherine Goldstein is a 
former SDNY Securities and Commodities 
Fraud Task Force chief with a sharp legal 
mindwho has worked on modernizing and 
improving insider trading enforcement. She 
has handled a number of high-profile white 
collar fraud cases. 
After Strauss and Mary Jo White, who held 
the post from 1993 until 2002, Goldstein 
would be the third woman to take the job in its 
more-than 200 year history, if confirmed. 
Anjan Sahni 
Like Williams and Goldstein, Anjan Sahni, a 
WilmerHale white collar partner, is a former 
SDNY Securities and Commodities Fraud 
Task Force chief. 
Sahni, who is of South Asian descent, also is 
noted for his work on a defense team 
that won acquittal for Citigroup trader Rohan 
Ramchandani in a closely-watched forex-
rigging criminal trial. 
Williams, Goldstein and Sahni are all said to 
be friendly with, and have professional ties to, 
former Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet 
Bharara, who was fired by the Trump 
administration in 2017. Sources said Bharara 
has a direct line to Schumer as the 
application process unfolds.

Trends That Rocked The Legal Industry In 2019 
From some law firms' hard-knuckle responses to discrimination lawsuits filed

some of the moments and trends that shook the industry in 2019. 
Looking Back: Law360's 2019 Legal Lions And Lambs

Poetic Justice: How Judges Got Creative In 2019 
Amid headline-grabbing decisions and groundbreaking precedent out of 
federal courts in 2019, judges also injected bits of levity and creativity in their 
otherwise serious work, quipping about that last "Game of Thrones" season or 
quoting the Bard. Here, Law360 presents some of the best poetry, zingers 
and pop-culture references that popped up in opinions over the past year. 
The 7 Most Divisive Judicial Confirmations Of 2019 
In a banner year for judicial confirmations, senators in 2019 signed off on 20 
circuit judges and 80 district judges as President Donald Trump clinched his 
185th appointment — but in reaching that milestone, Majority Leader Mitch 
McConnell faced a number of heated battles along the way. 
THE STATE OF THE LEGAL INDUSTRY 
The Law360 400 
Kirkland & Ellis LLP has redefined what it means to be the biggest of BigLaw 
— weighing in at 2,116 attorneys by year end 2018 and becoming the first firm 
since Law360 began tracking law firm head counts to top 2,000 U.S.-based 
attorneys. 
The 2019 Law360 Glass Ceiling Report 
Our annual survey of the largest U.S. law firms again shines a light on the 
lack of parity for female attorneys in private practice. Though women now 
make up more than half of law school students, the Glass Ceiling Report 
shows they continue to be underrepresented at all levels of a typical law firm 
and that their numbers dwindle as they move up the ranks. 
The 2019 Law360 Diversity Snapshot 
U.S. law firms have long touted their commitment to diversity and inclusion. 
But those goals still seem far from being realized. Law360's annual Diversity 
Snapshot indicates only marginal progress on racial and ethnic diversity in the 
attorney workforce from year to year, even as demands grow from clients 
expecting more diverse legal teams. 
PODCAST 
Law360's Pro Say: Will The Glass Ceiling Ever Break? 
For years women have been looking around their law firms and seeing mostly 
men in leadership. When will things change? On the latest episode of 
Law360's Pro Say podcast we discuss our annual Glass Ceiling report, which 
reveals a glacial pace for increased gender parity in the law, and we talk to 
one prominent female attorney who managed to crack the glass ceiling.

Governor Bill Richardson offered his assistance in the Jeffrey Epstein investigation through his lawyer, Jeff 
Brown of Dechert LLP, to the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York. In response to this offer, Mr. 
Brown was informed by the Assistant US Attorney responsible for the case that Governor Richardson is neither 
a target, subject, nor witness in the case and that there is no allegation against Governor Richardson about 
which the government is seeking a response from Gov. Richardson at this time. 
"It's fair to conclude that the federal prosecutors investigating this matter do not believe at this time the 
Governor participated in or witnessed the criminal activity Jeffrey Epstein is alleged to have committed," said 
Mr. Brown. 
Furthermore, Governor Richardson has never been contacted by any party to a lawsuit involving Epstein, nor 
by any law enforcement investigating Epstein. Governor Richardson hopes that the investigation continues so 
that Epstein's victims can finally have their day in court and see the justice they deserve.

Hi Ed, 
For the Ghislaine Maxwell case, I'd like to request approval to travel with our case agents to Durango, Colorado next week 
to interview a victim (and potential witness for trial this summer). Because it's a fairly long flight with a layover, the plan 
would be to fly out on Monday (4/12), conduct two days of interviews to debrief the victim and discuss testifying at trial, 
and return on Thursday (4/15). Other than flights and a hotel, I don't anticipate any other travel expenses for the trip. 
Thanks very much, and hope you're doing well--

Subject: OPR and PMRU Stuff 
Date: Thu, 08 Apr 2021 17:22:47 +0000 
SANYS 
Here's the relevant section of the Epstein OPR report, and the Justice Manual provision on the Professional 
Misconduct Review Unit, to which OPR findings of professional misconduct get referred. 
From the public Epstein OPR Executive Summary (fn's omitted): 
III. OVERVIEW OF OPR'S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK 
OPR's primary mission is to ensure that Department attorneys perform their duties in accordance with the 
highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation's principal law enforcement agency. 
Accordingly, OPR investigates allegations of professional misconduct against current or former Department 
attorneys related to the exercise of their authority to investigate, litigate, or provide legal advice. OPR also has 
jurisdiction to investigate allegations of misconduct against Department law enforcement agents when they relate 
to a Department attorney's alleged professional misconduct. 
In its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs the challenged conduct 
and whether a subject attorney violated that standard. Department attorneys are subject to various legal 
obligations and professional standards in the performance of their duties, including the Constitution, statutes, 
standards of conduct imposed by attorney licensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR 
finds misconduct when it concludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject attorney violated such a 
standard intentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR's analytical framework, when OPR concludes that (1) no 
clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not intentionally or 
recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the subject's conduct does not 
constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude that a subject attorney's conduct does not 
satisfy the elements necessary for a professional misconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another 
finding. In such cases, OPR may conclude that a subject attorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or 
otherwise acted inappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subject attorney's 
conduct was appropriate under the circumstances. 
From the Justice Manual 
1-4.320 - Adjudicating Findings of Attorney Professional Misconduct—The 
Professional Misconduct Review Unit 
Mission. Where OPR has made findings of attorney professional misconduct, those findings are referred to the 
Department's Professional Misconduct Review Unit (PMRU). Consistent with memoranda issued separately by the Deputy 
Attorney General, the PMRU evaluates any findings of professional misconduct by 0PR and, where appropriate, issues fair, 
timely, and consistent disciplinary decisions. The PMRU also authorizes referrals to the appropriate bar authority in those 
instances in which OPR concludes that a current or former Department attorney violated a rule of professional conduct 
during his or her tenure with the Department. 
Authority of the PMRU. The PMRU has authority to handle disciplinary matters involving career Department attorneys, 
except for those employed in the law enforcement components and certain employees of the Executive Office for 
Immigration Review. The PMRU has no authority to adjudicate disciplinary actions in misconduct cases pertaining to non-
career attorneys (whether appointed by the President with Senate confirmation, or otherwise politically appointed). The 
PMRU Chief has authority in his or her discretion to choose not to sustain findings of misconduct referred to the PMRU. 
The PMRU Chief also has the authority in his or her discretion to include in the PMRU disciplinary decision any poor 
judgment findings in reports of investigation that are closely related to the professional misconduct findings referred to the 
PMRU. Closely related findings are those findings that arise from the same report of investigation, are made against the 
same individual, and are based on the same or substantially similar conduct. The PMRU Chief's disciplinary authority 
EFTA00032930
--- PAGE 2 ---
includes the authority to resolve or authorize the resolution of any disciplinary action pending before the PMRU without 
the PMRU reaching a final decision on the merits of the action. Depending on the circumstances, the PMRU Chief may 
serve as the Grievance Official to a Letter of Reprimand issued by a PMRU Attorney or the Deciding Official on a 
suspension or removal action proposed by a PMRU Attorney. In all of its actions, the PMRU will operate in accordance 
with the due prorates requirements established in 5 U.S.C. § 7500 et seq., and 5 C.F.R. Part 752. 
Bar Referrals. At the conclusion of any final disciplinary action by the PMRU, including any decision from a final 
appellate authority, if there is a final determination that a subject attorney committed professional misconduct implicating 
a rule of professional conduct or when the PMRU Chief otherwise determines that a rule of professional conduct so 
requires, the PMRU Chief will direct OPR to refer the subject attorney to the appropriate bar authority or authorities. For 
former Department attorneys, the PMRU Chief may, after receiving an OPR report of investigation finding misconduct, 
issue a letter advising the subject attorney of the misconduct findings and informing the subject attorney of the right to 
submit an objection to OPR's findings. After receipt of an objection, if any, the PMRU Chief will determine if the matter 
will be referred to the appropriate bar authority under the same procedures as for Department attorneys. 
The Authority of the Deputy Attorney General. The Deputy Attorney General reserves the authority to designate 
individuals outside of the PMRU to serve as proposing, deciding, or grievance officials in all disciplinary matters, including 
those involving findings of professional misconduct by OPR, or to personally serve as the proposing, deciding, or grievance 
official. The Deputy Attorney General also reserves the right to designate an acting PMRU Chief.

Hey PCU —As you likely may have seen/heard at this point, last evening, we arrested Jeffrey Epstein on sex trafficking 
charges. Epstein is in custody and will be presented and arraigned on an Indictment that will be unsealed tomorrow 
morning. 
The case is an incredibly important one — not only is the conduct extremely serious and deeply disturbing — but our 
charges ensure that dozens if not more of Epstein's victims, girls who were as young as 14 at the time they were abused, 
will finally have their day in court. It is an extraordinarily worthy prosecution and just the latest example of how this 
unit will never shy away from bringing tough cases against powerful people who have committed grievous crimes. 
Please join me and 
in extending a very well-deserved congratulations to the team, 
who have worked tirelessly to make this case happen (and happen so quickly). They have done us all proud, and if you 
are free, we hope you join us for the press conference formally announcing the charges, which should happen Monday 
morning at 11.

Hello, I am a law professor. 
I note that the forfeiture is being done under a special Human Trafficking statute. In paragraph 25 of the indictment, you 
refer to 18 USC 1594(c)(1). But you meant 1594(d)(1). 1594(c)(1) does not exist. 
Typos in indictments have disastrous consequences, as I am sure you know. So you might want to correct this.

Hey there, 
Sorry we haven't been able to connect in a while. Are you still able to handle the immunity package for LEXUS and RICO 
memo for the VICAR murder charge against J-Rock and Sauce? I'm totally swamped with this Epstein stuff and won't be 
able to turn to that stuff until next week at the earliest. Would be amazing if you could handle. 
Thanks very much,

Good Afternoon All: 
If you are called for an interview by the agency or a representative of the agency (ie. FBI, AUSA, OIA, OIG), you 
are required to report the interview. You are required to be truthful. 
In line with your Weingarten rights, once at the interview you have the right to request a Union Representative. In 
line with the rights afforded to any other US citizen, during a criminal investigation, you have the right to invoke 
your 5th amendment right to remain silent until your attorney is present 
Blessings to all. 
In Unity!

New York, NY 10007 
Institution 
Supplement 
OPI: Correctional Services 
NUMBER: NYM 5500.14b 
DATE: November 13, 2014 
SUBJECT: Inmate Accountability 
1. 
PURPOSE: To outline the responsibility of all employees in the area of inmate accountability. 
Additionally, it is to establish and implement specific supervision and count procedures which will 
ensure the accountability of all inmates at all times. It will also explain the pass system which is 
designed to assist the employee in carrying out that responsibility. This institution supplement must be 
read in conjunction with national policy. 
2. 
DIRECTIVES AFFECTED: Institution Supplement 5511.06G dated June 18, 2007, is rescinded. 
P.S. 5500.14 Correctional Services Procedures Manual, dated 10/19/2012 is referenced. 
3. 
POLICY: To ensure that all inmates are supervised and accounted for according to their custody 
classification. 
IMPLEMENTATION AND PROCEDURES: 
4. 
RESPONSIBILITY: Employees will be knowledgeable of proper inmate accountability procedures. 
Accountability will be maintained by census checks and accurate counts. 
A. 
CUSTODY: Refers to the degree of staff supervision required for an individual inmate. 
B. 
CONTROL CENTER: The records are maintained in the control center. When an inmate arrives 
at the institution, R&D staff will be responsible for making picture cards of inmates for the 
Control Room records, in addition to the bed book and unit cards. The Control Room Officer 
will document records of all inmates in the institution by utilizing a pp30, daily sanitized roster. 
A photo of the inmate, with the inmate's name and register number will be on the card from 
R&D. Additionally, the following information will also be maintained by using a sentry roster, 
PP30 with these codes keyed in this order: reg, In, qtr, wrk, prd, cus, 2. This roster is to be 
generated daily and placed in the 30 day file.

5. 
COUNTS: The utmost precaution should be utilized when staff are conducting a count. Staff are to 
ensure they are observing a real person and not a "DUMMY". When conducting a count, the staff 
members will ensure that they personally observed breathing human flesh for each inmate 
counted. All counts shall be double counted by two staff members and both staff shall print and 
sign their names to the count slip. Inmate details of more than five inmates shall also be double 
counted. Official counts will be conducted at the following times: 
12:00 AM 
3:00 AM 
5:00 AM 
10:00 AM (Weekends and Holidays, only) 
4:00 PM 
10:00 PM 
The 4:00 PM. 10:00 AM and 10:00 PM counts are MANDATORY STAND-UP COUNTS. 
The master count sheet is obtained using Sentry transaction PPEI. In the event that SENTRY is 
down, the Control Room Officer shall prepare an error free master count sheet (Attachment 1). 
At a minimum, two officers will count each unit. One officer will count while the second officer 
stands in a position to observe the movements of inmates. Upon the completion of the first 
count, the officers will change positions and the second officer will count. At the end of the 
second count, the count will be called into the Control Room for acceptance. There will be no 
movement of inmates during the count. While counting, officers will not permit anything short 
of an emergency to distract them. The officers who conducted the count will remain in the area 
until the count has been cleared by Control. When counting at night, flashlights should be used 
judiciously, but enough light should be shown on the inmate as to leave no doubt that the officer 
is counting a breathing living human body. 
A. 
LOCK-DOWN ACCOUNTABILITY CHECK: A lock-down accountability check will be 
conducted at this institution a minimum of once per month. The accountability check will be 
announced over the public address system at a random time and date with no prior notification to 
the various departments. This procedure is used to determine if inmates are authorized to be in 
the respective areas: 
Although not designed to be strictly a head count, every effort should be made to arrive at a total 
institution head count. If this is not accomplished within a reasonable length of time, the Warden 
may resume normal operations with the understanding there is an accountability problem which 
needs to be corrected. 
Upon hearing the announcement for an accountability check, staff will secure all entrance and 
exits. No inmate movement will be allowed following the announcement. Staff members will

survey their areas of supervisory responsibility and verify that only authorized inmates are 
present. 
The following information will be gathered from each area and reported to the Lieutenant's 
Office. This form is to be reproduced locally from the Correctional Services Manual 
(Attachment 2). 
1. 
Total number of inmates present who are authorized. 
2. 
Total number of inmates present who are unauthorized, including names and register 
numbers. 
3. 
The total number of inmates who are unauthorized to be missing, including their names 
and register numbers. 
The above information will be placed on the Lock Down Accountability Check form and the 
form will be submitted to the Lieutenant's Office immediately. A Lieutenant will be responsible 
for supervising the accountability check and documenting the results (i.e., time involved, 
discrepancies noted, action taken, etc.). 
DURING A LOCK DOWN ACCOUNTABILITY CHECK, INMATES WILL BE 
QUICKLY LOCATED INTO A CENTRAL AREA AND COUNTED. ALL INMATE 
MOVEMENT WILL CEASE AT THAT POINT UNTIL THE CENSUS COUNT HAS 
BEEN CLEARED. 
Inmates on the elevator will be transported to a safe location where no separatee exists. 
B. 
)3ED BOOK COUNTS: The Bed Books will be utilized for emergency counts, bad institutional 
counts and random Bed Book counts requested by the Shift Lieutenant. When a unit has two 
consecutive bad counts, a bed book count must be conducted. In conjunction with the Bed Book 
the unit roster will be used to conduct these counts. Upon receiving a new inmate on the unit, the 
unit officer will receive two 3 x 5 cards, one to be utilized for the bed book, and the other to use 
for inmate movement. The bed book card is not to be removed from the bed book. 
C. 
OFFICIAL COUNT FORMS/COUNT SLIPS: All official count forms prepared by the Control 
Room Officer will be in ink. The count verification on all official count slips and forms will be 
in ink. All count slips are to be prepared in ink without error and forwarded to the Control Room 
Officer. Completed count slips, out count sheets, and official count sheets will be retained for 30 
days. (Attachment 5) 
AT LEAST ONE OFFICIAL COUNT ON THE E/W AND M/W SHIFT WILL BE 
TAKEN AND VERIFIED BY A LIEUTENANT ON DUTY.

D. 
OUT COUNTS: Out counts will be kept to a minimum. Staff who will have inmates out of 
quarters at count time must sign their out count sheet prior to submission to the Operations 
Lieutenant for approval, the out count (Attachment 4) must be forwarded to Control Room forty-
five (45) minutes prior to the official count time. All out counts of more than five inmates will 
require two staff members to conduct the count utilizing detail cards for identification. 
The Control Room Officer will check each out-count sheet by verifying the unit assignment as 
reported to ensure accuracy, and notify the Operations Lieutenant of any out count which appears 
to have discrepancies. All out counts will be approved by the Operations Lieutenant. 
(Attachment 6) 
E. 
CENSUS CHECKS: 
All departments must conduct a census of all inmates assigned to their area and/or detail during 
each work period (AM and PM). Census checks will be conducted at approximately 8:30 A.M. 
and 12:30 P.M., Monday through Friday. The Control Center will announce over all radio 
channels to begin conducting the census. The results of the AM and PM census checks will 
documented in the unit officer's log book (ex., Unit 5-South AM Census completed with zero 
absent and zero unauthorized). Departments not having a log book will document census check 
results on the Summary of Daily Census Form (Attachment 4). This procedure is designed to 
determine whether or not inmates are authorized to be in a respective area. The Control Center 
will report any discrepancies to the Lieutenant's Office immediately. 
F. 
LOCKDOWN CENSUS COUNTS: 
At the Lieutenant's direction, Control Center will announce over all radio channels a Lockdown 
Census Count. The results of this count will be called into the Lieutenant's Office. The Internal 
Officer will distribute the Lockdown Accountability Census Detail Form (Attachment 2). All 
unit officers and detail supervisors will complete Attachment 2 and forward to the Lieutenant's 
Office. This procedure is designed to determine whether or not inmates are authorized to be in a 
respective area.

The Activities Lieutenant will ensure that each inmate assigned to the detail has a card and all inmates 
are physically accounted for. The Activities Lieutenant will be required to submit all discrepancies in 
writing to the Chief Correctional Supervisor's office. (Attachment 7) 
7. 
DAILY TRANSFER SHEET: The Control Room Officer will be responsible for generating the Daily 
Transfer Sheet Change Sheet, Monday through Friday. The procedure to complete this task is done by 
performing Sentry Transaction PPF6, followed by Sentry Transaction PP48. This will delete the Call-
Outs, and Changes from the previous day. The Control Center will maintain a running master base count 
worksheet (Attachment 8) that will be used to track and edit all movement in the institution. 
After the PPF6 and PP48 are completed then proceed to Sentry Transaction PP39. The PP39 will be all 
the Call-Outs and Changes for the proceeding date. The following morning at 0001, the Morning Watch 
Officer will perform Sentry Transaction PPF6, with the future date, this will program the future changes 
in Sentry. If there are no changes for any given day, on the last page of the call-out, the last remark will 
be; Transaction Successfully Completed. 
8. 
CALL-OUTS: Sufficient copies of the master call-out sheet for distribution to all units will be copied 
and forwarded to the Control Center Officer so that the Morning Watch Control Center Officer can place 
one in each detail pouch. Extra copies of the call-outs will be placed at the detail pouch cabinet. Unit 
officers will post the call-out in the housing units. 
The employee who places an inmate on call-out must ensure the requested inmate arrives at the specified 
time. If the inmate does not arrive as scheduled, the requesting staff member shall contact the staff 
member responsible for the inmate's accountability. It is the responsibility of the staff member or 
department to prepare an incident report for inmates who fail to report for a call-out or is found to be in 
an unauthorized area. If efforts to locate the inmate fail, the inmate shall be immediately reported to the 
shift lieutenant as missing and appropriate action initiated to locate the inmate. 
9. 
PASS SYSTEM: MCC New York does not utilize a pass system for inmate movement. With the 
exception of work calls and scheduled mass movement, inmates within the confines of the institution 
will be escorted by a staff member with the use of a picture on a 3x5 card. 
A. 
GATE PASSES: All gate passes must contain the following information: Inmate's picture, 
custody classification, work assignment, offense, and sentence. Each card shall be signed by the 
Chief Correctional Supervisor and the Associate Warden responsible for Correctional Services, 
each card will also be stamped with an imprint seal and laminated for durability. The imprint 
shall cover a portion of the inmate's picture to prevent tampering with the gate pass. The Chief 
Correctional Supervisor will maintain accountability of blank gate passes. When a decision is 
made to permanently remove an inmate's gate pass, the Chief Correctional Supervisor will 
forward the gate pass to the Cadre Unit Secretary for proper disposal. The Cadre Unit Secretary 
will keep a log accounting for the issuance and disposition of all gate passes.

Gate passes will be maintained at the rear entrance during normal working day operations, 
Monday through Friday. After hours and on weekends, the passes will remain in the Control 
Center Officer. 
If a discrepancy is identified with a gate pass, the gate pass will be removed and forwarded to the 
Chief Correctional Supervisor with a written explanation describing the discrepancy. 
10. 
RETAIL CREW KITS; Detail cards will be maintained by the Control Room Officer. At a minimum, 
crew kit cards shall contain the following: inmate's name and register number, current photo (a new 
photo must be made whenever an inmate's appearance changes), job assignment, housing assignment, 
custody level, and any special conditions. Crew kits will be picked up by all Departments at the 
beginning of the shift. 
A chit will be used for accountability of crew kits. Detail supervisors are held responsible for inmates 
whose cards are included in the respective crew kits, and for accountability of the crew kit while checked 
out from the Control Center Officer. A Lieutenant will monitor this procedure for compliance. The 
crew kits will include a SENTRY printout of the specific detail roster. All crew kits will be returned to 
the Control Center Officer at the end of the work day; all cards must be included in the crew kit. Inmates 
shall never be allowed to handle detail/crew kit cards. 
The Morning Watch Control Center Officer will receive the SENTRY transactions from the Control 
Room Officer; this will include the Daily /Transfer sheet (PP39) and SENTRY Detail Roster. 
All inmates' current job, housing, and custody assignments will be updated daily by the Morning Watch 
Control Center Officer. The Morning Watch Control Center Officer will place the new detail roster into 
the detail pouches daily. This roster will inform the Detail Supervisors of any changes which may affect 
an inmate's status on his crew. 
The Morning Watch Control Center Officer will perform the following tasks: 
a. 
Insert any new detail cards into the appropriate kit. 
b. 
Remove any detail cards of inmates who have transferred out of the institution or have 
been removed from that detail. These cards will then be forwarded to the Lieutenant's 
Office. 
c. 
Check each detail to ensure that each inmate on the SENTRY roster has a picture card in 
the crew kit. 
d. 
Audit all detail pouches and note any discrepancies. Submit written report of detail 
pouch audit. (Attachment 9) 
The morning watch Operations Lieutenant will ensure that the above is accomplished.

will obtain any missing detail card(s) from R&D. Detail Foremen will check their detail cards at the 
beginning of the work day and after lunch to determine if all inmates assigned to that detail are 
accounted for. When the detail foremen return their crew kits to the Control Center Officer at the end of

work detail. During work call, no inmate will be allowed to leave their assigned units without being 
escorted by a Detail Foreman. 
The Detail Foreman will present a detail work card to the Unit Officer for each inmate assigned to the 
detail. At this time, the Unit Officer may release the respective inmates to the Detail Foreman. If the 
Detail Foreman cannot present a work detail card to the Unit Officer, the Unit Officer WILL NOT 
release the inmate into the custody of the Detail Foreman. 
The Internal Security Officer will run the elevator between the floors that are involved in the move. All

PROGRAM STATEMENT 
OPI: 
OGC/ELE 
NUMBER: 
3420.11 
DATE: 
12/6/2013 
Standards of Employee Conduct 
Is/ 
Approved: Charles E. Samuels, Jr. 
Director, Federal Bureau of Prisons 
1. PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
To provide policies and procedures, referred to as the "Standards of Conduct," to complement 
those issued by the Office of Government Ethics on: 
■ Employee conduct and responsibility. 
■ Ethics in matters involving conflicts of interest. 
■ Post-employment restrictions. 
■ Procurement integrity issues. 
■ Attorney ethics. 
■ Outside employment. 
These standards apply to all employees of the Bureau of Prisons (Bureau), including employees 
of the Public Health Service and the National Institute of Corrections, and to any person detailed 
to any of those agencies under the Intergovernmental Personnel Act. 
Such employees are subject to certain standards and prohibitions — some statutory, some 
regulatory, and some a matter of good ethical principles that are essential to the efficiency of the 
organization. 
Contractors and volunteers working in Bureau facilities also are expected to conduct themselves 
by these standards, where applicable. 
SDNY_00008394 
EFTA00033486
--- PAGE 2 ---
While issuances from the Office of Government Ethics and the Department of Justice address the 
basic standards and prohibitions applicable to Bureau employees, this Program Statement more 
specifically addresses situations that especially apply to Bureau employment. It cannot, however, 
attempt to detail every incident that could violate the Standards of Conduct. 
a. Summary of Changes 
Directive Rescinded 
P3420.09 
Standards of Employee Conduct (2105/99) 
Changes in this issuance include: 
■ Specifying illegal drugs prohibited under Section 5, Personal Conduct. 
■ Eliminating the moving traffic violations reporting requirement under Section 7, Illegal 
Activities. 
Greater changes include those found under the Introduction of Contraband, Government 
Property, and Outside Employment sections. 
b. Program Objectives. The expected results of this program are: 
■ Employees will conduct themselves in a manner that fosters respect for the Bureau of 
Prisons, the Department of Justice, and the U.S. Government. 
■ Employees will avoid situations that involve conflicts of interest with their employment. 
■ Employees will comply with restrictions on employment outside the Bureau and after 
employment with the Bureau. 
■ Employees will conform to procurement integrity regulations. 
■ Employees will uphold the ethical rules governing their professions. 
■ Employees will immediately report any violation, or apparent violation, of standards of 
conduct to their Chief Executive Officer (CEO) or another appropriate authority. 
■ Employees who fail to conduct themselves in accordance with these standards will be subject 
to appropriate sanctions.

3. PUBLICATION AND INTERPRETATION 
The CEO of each facility has the primary responsibility for ensuring that the Standards of 
Employee Conduct are provided and made known to each employee, contractor, and volunteer. 
The CEO must ensure that staff are made aware of updates and revisions that affect employee 
conduct and receive annual training on their responsibilities under this policy. 
Per 5 CFR §2635.107, only actions made in reliance upon advice concerning ethical issues, 
received from the Ethics Office, will be protected from disciplinary action. No other authority 
may provide the employee this protection. 
P3420.11 12/6/2013 
SDNY_00008397 
EFTA00033489
--- PAGE 5 ---
Where the employee's conduct violates a criminal statute, reliance on the advice of an ethics 
official cannot ensure he/she will not be prosecuted. 
Each new employee, contractor, and volunteer must receive and sign for this Program Statement 
at the time of appointment. 
Employees, contractors, and volunteers receive and sign for updated versions of this Program 
Statement when issued. The form Acknowledgement of Receipt of Standards of Employee 
Conduct (BP-A0165) is filed on the left side of the Official Personnel Folder. 
Employee Development Managers, Volunteer Coordinators, or other designated staff ensure that 
supervisors and employees receive annual training on their responsibilities under this policy. 
4. GENERAL POLICY 
Bureau employees are governed by regulations in 5 CFR Part 2635. While this Program 
Statement clarifies the applications of those regulations in the Bureau, it does not and cannot 
specify every incident that would violate the Standards of Conduct. 
In general, the Bureau expects its employees to conduct themselves in such a manner that their 
activities both on and off duty do not discredit the agency. Employees must: 
■ Conduct themselves in a manner that fosters respect for the Bureau of Prisons, the 
Department of Justice, and the U.S. Government. 
■ Only arrest in their official capacity as permitted by 18 U.S.C. § 3050 and other relevant 
provisions of the United States Code, the Program Statements Searching, Detaining, or 
Arresting Visitors to Bureau Grounds and Facilities and Staff Entrance and Search 
Procedures, or other authority officially granted to them. 
■ Endeavor to avoid any actions creating the appearance that they are violating the law or the 
ethical standards promulgated in this policy and the statutes. 
■ Avoid conflicts of interest in matters that affect their financial interests. 
■ Comply with post-employment restrictions. 
■ Conform to procurement integrity regulations. 
■ Uphold the ethical rules governing their professions, including complying with applicable 
licensing authority rules, except when they conflict with Federal law. 
■ Follow special rules to avoid conflicts of interest when seeking employment outside the 
Bureau. 
■ As soon as practicable (but no later than 24 hours) report to their CEO (or other appropriate 
authority such as the Office of Internal Affairs or the Office of the Inspector General) any 
P3420.11 12/6/2013 
SDNY_00008398 
EFTA00033490
--- PAGE 6 ---
violation, appearance of a violation, or attempted violation of these Standards or of any law, 
rule, or regulation. 
Every employee is required to immediately report to management any act or omission by any 
person that could result in a breach of institution security. 
Failure by employees to follow these regulations and policy or any other Bureau policy or 
relevant regulation(s) could result in disciplinary action, up to and including removal (see 
Attachment A). 
5. PERSONAL CONDUCT 
Employees are expected to conduct themselves in a manner that contributes to the orderly 
running of Bureau facilities. Some types of behavior cannot be tolerated in the Bureau: 
a. Alcohol/Illegal Drugs. The use of illegal drugs or the abuse of any drug, including 
prescription-controlled substances, is strictly prohibited. Illegal drugs include, but are not limited 
to: 
■ Marijuana. 
■ Cocaine. 
■ Ecstasy. 
■ Heroin. 
■ Amphetamines ("speed" or "crank"). 
■ Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD). 
Use of alcoholic beverages or being under the influence of alcohol while on duty or immediately 
before reporting for duty are prohibited. Employees are subject to disciplinary action if found to 
possess a .02 or greater blood alcohol content while on duty. 
b. Sexual Relationships/Contact With Inmates. Employees may not allow themselves to 
show partiality toward, or become emotionally, physically, sexually, or financially involved with 
inmates, former inmates, or persons known (or who should have been known based on 
circumstances) to the employee as a family member or close friend of inmates or former inmates. 
Chaplains, psychologists, and psychiatrists may continue a previously established therapeutic 
relationship with a former inmate in accordance with their codes of professional conduct and 
responsibility.

SDNY_00008399 
EFTA00033491
--- PAGE 7 ---
Bureau staff may not serve as program volunteers in religious services and educational programs. 
Under no circumstances are staff volunteers authorized to participate in inmate programs on a 
regular or occasional basis. 
An employee may not engage in, or allow another person to engage in, sexual behavior with an 
inmate. There is never any such thing as consensual sex between staff and inmates. 
Title 18, U.S. Code Chapter 109A provides penalties of up to life imprisonment for sexual abuse 
of inmates where the force is used or threatened. Sexual contact is defined as the intentional 
touching of the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks with the intent to abuse, 
humiliate, harass, degrade, arouse, or gratify the sexual desire of any person. 
Penetration is not required to support a conviction for sexual contact. All allegations of sexual 
abuse will be thoroughly investigated and, when appropriate, referred to authorities for 
prosecution. 
Employees are subject to administrative action, up to and including removal, for any 
inappropriate contact, sexual behavior, or relationship with inmates, regardless of whether such 
contact constitutes a prosecutable crime. Physical contact is not required to subject an employee 
to sanctions for misconduct of a sexual nature. 
c. Additional Conduct Issues. An employee may not offer or give to an inmate or a former 
inmate or any member of his/her family, or to any person known to be associated with an inmate 
or former inmate, any article, favor, or service that is not authorized in the performance of the 
employee's duties. 
Neither shall an employee accept any gift, personal service, or favor from an inmate or former 
inmate, or from anyone known to be associated with or related to an inmate or former inmate. 
This prohibition includes becoming involved with families or associates of inmates. 
An employee may not show favoritism or give preferential treatment to one inmate, or a group of 
inmates, over another. 
Consistent with policies and regulations: 
■ An employee may not use brutality, physical violence, or intimidation toward inmates, or use 
any force beyond what is reasonably necessary to subdue an inmate. 
P3420.11 12/6/2013 
SDNY_00008400 
EFTA00033492
--- PAGE 8 ---
■ An employee may not use physical violence, threats, or intimidation toward any person 
visiting a Bureau work site or toward fellow employees. 
In their official capacity, employees may not use profane, obscene, or abusive language when 
communicating with inmates, fellow employees, or others. Employees shall conduct themselves 
in a manner that will not be demeaning to inmates, fellow employees, or others. The above 
requirements also apply to situations where there is a nexus between the employee's conduct and 
his/her position. 
An employee who becomes involved in circumstances as described in this section, Section 9 (or 
any situation that might give the appearance of improper involvement with inmates or former 
inmates or their families, including employees whose relatives are inmates or former inmates) 
must report the contact in writing to the CEO as soon as practicable. (This includes, but is not 
limited to, telephone calls or written communications with such persons outside the normal scope 
of employment.) The employee will then be instructed as to the appropriate course of action. 
Exempted program officials must obtain prior approval to communicate with former inmates, 
their family members, or associates. All communications must occur from an institution 
setting. 
Employees must avoid situations that give rise to a conflict of interest or the appearance of a 
conflict of interest (see Section 2, Definitions). 
Employees shall not participate in conduct that would lead a reasonable person to question their 
impartiality. 
6. RESPONSIVENESS 
Inattention to duty in a correctional environment can result in escapes, assaults, and other 
incidents. Employees are required to remain fully alert and attentive during duty hours. 
Because failure to respond to an emergency may jeopardize the security of the institution, as well 
as the lives of staff or inmates, it is mandatory that employees respond immediately, effectively, 
and appropriately during all emergency situations. 
Employees are to obey the orders of their superiors at all times. In an emergency situation, 
carrying out the orders of those in command is imperative to ensure the security of the institution.

--- PAGE 9 ---
7. ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES 
Illegal activities on the part of any employee, in addition to being unlawful, reflect on the 
integrity of the Bureau and betray the trust and confidence placed in it by the public. 
It is expected that employees obey not only the letter of the law, but also the spirit of the law 
while engaged in personal or official activities. 
Should an employee be charged with, arrested for, or convicted of any felony or misdemeanor, 
that employee must immediately inform and provide a written report to the CEO. 
8. INTRODUCTION OF CONTRABAND 
Per 28 CFR § 500.1(h), contraband is defined as "material prohibited by law, or by regulation, or 
material which can reasonably be expected to cause physical injury or adversely affect the 
security, safety, or good order of the institution." 
Introducing or attempting to introduce contraband into or upon the grounds of any Federal 
correctional institution, or taking or attempting to take contraband out of it, without the CEO's 
knowledge and consent, is prohibited. 
Staff may bring personal items into or upon the grounds of an institution, unless otherwise 
prohibited by the Warden. Such items must remain in the possession of the employee, and /or be 
secured away from inmates, and disposed of properly when no longer needed. Consult the 
Program Statement Staff Entrance and Search Procedures for additional requirements. 
9. OFFICIAL INVESTIGATION 
It is not the policy of the Bureau to routinely search employees or their property; however, the 
Bureau retains the right to conduct searches of employees when such a search is believed 
necessary to ensure institution security and good order. Searches are conducted in accordance 
with the Program Statement Staff Entrance and Search Procedures. Representation will be 
afforded to staff in accordance with the Master Agreement and Title 5. 
During the course of an official investigation, employees are to cooperate fully by providing all 
pertinent information they may have. Full cooperation requires truthfully responding to 
questions and providing a signed affidavit if requested. Any employee who fails to cooperate 
fully or who hinders an investigation is subject to disciplinary action, up to and including 
removal. 
P3420.11 12/6/2013 
SDNY_00008402 
EFTA00033494
--- PAGE 10 ---
In official investigations conducted by the Bureau of Prisons, an employee will be provided a 
copy of his/her signed affidavit upon request, absent rare or exigent circumstances. If this 
occurs, staff will be given the opportunity to review prior affidavits before giving another 
affidavit. 
Employees must respond truthfully and in a timely manner to requests for information related to 
their background security investigation. Failure to do so may result in disciplinary action up to 
and including removal. Form BP-A0194, Warning and Assurance to Employee Required to 
Provide Information, will be provided upon request to the employee who is the subject of the 
investigation. 
10. JUST DEBTS 
Failure on the part of any employee, without good reason and in a timely manner, to honor debts 
acknowledged by him/her to be valid or reduced to judgment by a court, or to adhere to 
satisfactory arrangements for the settlement of the debts, may be cause for disciplinary action. 
Depending on the circumstances, an employee who receives a legally valid garnishment order 
may be subject to disciplinary action. 
II. CONFIDENTIALITY 
Employees of the Bureau have access to official information ranging from personal data 
concerning staff and inmates to information involving security. Because of the varying degrees 
of sensitivity, such information may be disclosed or released only as required in the performance 
of an employee's duties or upon specific authorization from someone who has the authority to 
release official information. The only persons so authorized are: 
■ In the Central Office, the Director or designee. 
■ In a Regional Office, the Regional Director or designee. 
■ In other locations, the CEO or designee. 
The above shall not be construed as a reason to deny authorized persons access to official records 
and files. The Bureau has an obligation to supply official information in response to requests 
from organizations or individuals who have been properly identified and are acting in an official 
capacity. 
To ensure the proper use of official information, the following rules of conduct are established: 
P3420.11 12/6/2013 
1O 
SDNY_00008403 
EFTA00033495
--- PAGE 11 ---
■ Employees must verify the identification and authority of individuals requesting access to 
information before giving or discussing records, personnel files, or other official information. 
■ Employees may not deny authorized persons access to official information. 
■ Employees may not use, or release for use, official information for private purposes unless 
that information is available to the general public. 
■ Employees may not remove information from files or make copies of records or documents, 
except in accordance with established procedures or upon proper authorization. 
■ Employees may not make statements or release official information that could breach the 
security of the institution or endanger any person. 
■ Employees must guard against providing or disclosing official information to persons without 
a valid need to know. 
■ Former employees may be granted access only to information available to the general public 
and have no greater standing than the general public, irrespective of their past employment 
and any associations developed during it. 
12. GOVERNMENT PROPERTY 
Government property is to be used for authorized purposes only. Authorized purposes include 
personal use of Government office equipment such as computers, printers, fax machines, 
telephones, copiers, calculators, and Government-issued cellular phones, provided there is only a 
negligible cost to the Government. 
Personal use of office equipment may take place before or after official working hours or during 
non-paid meal breaks. 
Negligible costs are those which have no adverse impact to the Government and include, but are 
not limited to, the cost of electricity, ink, and ordinary wear and tear. Employees must provide 
their own paper. 
Personal use of office equipment will not take place during official working hours, with the 
following exceptions: 
a. Office and Cellular Telephones. Employees may place a personal call on a Government 
telephone during official working hours if the call: 
■ Does not adversely affect the performance of official duties by the employee or the Bureau. 
■ Is of reasonable duration and frequency. 
■ Could not reasonably have been made at another time. 
P3420.11 12/6/2013 
SDNY_00008400 
EFTA00033496
--- PAGE 12 ---
■ Is within the employee's local commuting area (not applicable to cellular telephones). 
b. Fitness Equipment. Employees may use Government-owned fitness equipment during 
breaks if such equipment is intended exclusively for employee use. 
This policy does not prevent the establishment of additional rules or restrictions, for business 
reasons, on the use of Government property. 
13. CREDENTIALS 
Bureau identification cards or credentials may always be used by staff to verify Bureau 
employment to any entity. 
Employees may not obtain or use identification cards or badges from sources other than the 
Bureau that give the appearance of being an official Bureau credential or badge. 
Employees may never use Agency-issued identification cards or credentials to represent that it is 
a Bureau requirement to carry a personal firearm on or off duty. 
Employees may use credentials to prove Government employment for purposes of permissible 
discounts offered to a broad class of Government employees. 
14. OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT 
a. Definitions (for purposes of this section) 
(1) Criminal Matters. Involvement with Federal, state, or local law enforcement agencies, 
matters carried out under 18 U.S.C., involvement with Federal, state, or local inmates.

(3) Exceptions. Employees who perform voluntary service, involving religious activity, 
employee's club, credit union, or union activities, which do not conflict with their official duties 
or with the Bureau's mission, are exempt from the requirement to request approval for these 
activities. 
(4) Other Requirements. 
■ Any approval granted for outside employment or activity applies only to the particular

The employee is responsible for supplying all relevant information required on the forms. 
Failing to do this could result in processing delays or a denial of the request. 
(6) Waiver. Employees whose request for approval has been denied in accordance with the 
General Limitations in Section 14.b. may request a waiver per 5 CFR 3801.106(6)(2).

P3420.11 12/6/2013 
SONY_00008407 
EFTA00033499
--- PAGE 15 ---
e. Expert Witness. An employee may not serve, other than on behalf of the United States, as an 
expert witness (with or without compensation) in any proceeding before a court or agency of the 
United States in which the United States is a party unless his/her participation is authorized by 
the Bureau. Authorization may be provided by the Bureau Ethics Officer, per 5 C.F.R. § 
2635.805(c). 
f. Other Government Employment. With limited exceptions, Bureau employees may not be 
employed by or contract for employment with any other Federal or law enforcement agency 
while employed by the Bureau. This prohibition does not apply to Federal military service, 
including reserve duty and National Guard service. 
g. Guidance. Employees should contact the Ethics Office for guidance concerning outside 
employment. 
15. RULES FOR ATTORNEYS 
a. Approval of Exceptions. Attorneys for the Bureau may not practice law for compensation on 
behalf of any other person or entity without the written approval of the Deputy Attorney General. 
However, Bureau attorneys may perform uncompensated legal practice outside the Bureau if: 
■ The work does not violate 18 U.S.C. §§ 203 and 205. 
■ The General Counsel has approved the request. 
■ The work does not involve criminal matters. 
b. Confidentiality. Only under limited circumstances does the attorney/client privilege of 
confidentiality apply to communications with a Bureau employee. 
c. Successive Government and Private Employment. A former Bureau attorney may not 
represent a private client in connection with a matter in which the attorney participated 
personally and substantially as a public officer. In such a case, the attorney's firm may have 
obligations to screen the former employee under applicable bar rules from any participation in 
the matter in which he/she participated in personally, and is awarded no part of the fee. 
Like any Bureau employee, an attorney may not negotiate for private employment with any party 
involved in a Bureau matter in which he/she is participating personally and substantially. 
d. Other Duties. In addition to the ethical rules attorneys must follow, the duties of a Bureau 
attorney are further defined by Federal regulations and Bureau policy. 
P3420.11 12/6/2013 
SDNY_00008408 
EFTA00033500
--- PAGE 16 ---
16. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST 
Bureau employees, acting in their official capacities, must avoid situations that affect or appear to 
affect their private interests, financial or non-financial. An employee may not engage in outside 
activities that conflict with his/her official duties. 
a. Prohibitions. Employees are prohibited from taking official action, on behalf of the 
Government, on matters that affect the financial interests of: 
■ The employee, spouse, minor child, or a general partner of an employee. 
■ An organization where the employee is an officer, director, trustee, partner, or employee. 
■ An organization the employee is negotiating with for future employment (18 U.S.C. § 208). 
b. Waivers. The Director may grant an individual waiver if the interest is found not to be so 
substantial as to affect the employee's service to the Bureau. 
An employee with a conflict of interest may ask to have himself or herself recused from the 
matter, sell the asset, or resign. 
An employee must seek written authorization before participating in a matter that could lead a 
reasonable person to question the his/her impartiality, even if there is no statutory conflict of 
interest (5 C.F.R. § 2635.502). 
Procurement officials: see Section 19, Procurement Integrity. 
17. SEEKING OTHER EMPLOYMENT 
A Bureau employee who wishes to seek employment with persons who would be affected by the 
performance or nonperformance of the employee's official duties is required to disqualify 
himself or herself from participation in any matter that will have a direct and predictable effect 
on the financial interests of the person with whom he/she is negotiating. 
When an employee is not actually negotiating for employment, but lacks impartiality in dealing 
with a prospective employer, the employee should disqualify himself or herself. 
A Bureau employee who is or should be aware of the need to disqualify himself or herself from 
participation in a particular matter must contact his/her supervisor and request in writing to be 
removed from the matter. 
P3420.11 12/6/2013 
SDNY_00008409 
EFTA00033501
--- PAGE 17 ---
18. POST-EMPLOYMENT 
The Office of Government Ethics, in accordance with statutes, has issued post-employment 
restrictions for Federal employees who leave Federal service. There is a general restriction on 
the representation of parties in matters related to their Federal employment. This regulation is 
not designed to bar an individual from accepting employment with any private or public 
employer after his/her service at the Bureau, but does prohibit certain acts that are detrimental to 
public confidence in Government. 
a. Lifetime Prohibition. Former Bureau employees are prohibited from representing another 
party before the Government on a particular matter involving specific parties in which they 
participated personally and substantially while working for the Government. This prohibition 
does not apply to: 
■ An appearance or communication involving purely social contacts. 
■ A request for publicly available documents. 
■ A request for purely factual information or the supplying of such information (18 U.S.C. § 
207(a)(1)). 
b. Two-Year Prohibition. After leaving the Bureau, a former employee is restricted from 
acting as a representative on a particular matter for which the employee had official 
responsibility, rather than personal participation. The restriction applies if the former employee 
knew, or reasonably should have known, that the matter was pending under his/her official 
responsibility during his/her last year of Government service (18 U.S.C. § 207(a)(2)). 
c. One-Year Prohibition. Former senior-level employees who meet a certain compensation 
threshold (please consult with the Ethics Office for the current threshold) are prohibited from 
representing any party before or making any communications with the intent to influence to any 
Government agency for one year (18 U.S.C. § 207(c)). 
19. PROCUREMENT INTEGRITY 
During the conduct of a procurement, a procurement official is prohibited from knowingly, 
directly or indirectly, soliciting or accepting any promise of future employment or business from 
an officer, employee, representative, agent, or consultant of a competing contractor. This 
prohibition includes engaging in any discussion of future employment or business opportunity. 
See the Procurement Integrity Act, 41 U.S.C. § 423. 
P3420.11 12/6/2013 
SDNY_00008410 
EFTA00033502
--- PAGE 18 ---
a. Recusal To Discuss Employment. In certain instances, a procurement official may obtain 
permission to withdraw from further participation in a procurement to discuss future employment 
with a competing contractor. An eligible procurement official may, in accordance with specific 
procedures in the regulations, request to be recused from participation in the procurement. 
A procurement official is not eligible for recusal if, during the period beginning with the 
issuance of a procurement solicitation and ending with the award of a contract, he/she has 
participated personally and substantially in the evaluation of bids or proposals, the selection of 
sources, or the conduct of negotiations. 
An individual may not commence discussions with a competing contractor until he/she has 
received written approval of the recusal request from his/her supervisor. 
Rejection of a recusal request is not an adverse personnel action. 
b. Post-Employment Restrictions For Procurement Officials. The Procurement Integrity Act 
places restrictions on employees involved in procurement who leave Federal service. A former 
procurement official cannot, for one year after his/her last personal and substantial involvement 
in a procurement in excess of $10,000,000, accept compensation from such contractor as an 
employee, officer, director, or consultant. This does not prohibit former procurement officials 
from accepting compensation from any division or affiliate of a contractor that does not produce 
the same or similar products or services for which the employee contracted while a Government 
employee.

Attachment A. Standard Schedule of Disciplinary Offenses and Penalties 
I. This table is intended to be used as a guide in determining appropriate discipline to propose 
according to the type of offense committed. The offenses listed are not inclusive of all offenses. 
2. Ordinarily, penalties proposed should be within the range of penalties provided for an offense. 
In aggravated cases, a penalty outside the range of penalties may be imposed. For example, 
supervisors, because of their responsibility to demonstrate exemplary behavior, may be subject to 
a greater penalty than is provided in the range of penalties. When a more severe penalty than 
provided for in the range of penalties is proposed, the notice of proposed action must provide a 
justification. 
3. The deciding official considers relevant circumstances, including mitigating and aggravating 
factors, when determining the appropriate penalty. The range of penalties provided for most 
offenses is intentionally broad, ranging from official reprimand to removal. While the principles 
of progressive discipline are normally applied, it is understood that there are offenses so 
egregious as to warrant severe sanctions for the first offense, up to and including removal. For 
example, if an incident is of a sexual nature or includes sexual harassment or is a criminal matter, 
the penalty must be more severe. This is especially true in cases where there is no indication that 
the employee would be corrected by a lesser penalty, or if the offense is of such a nature that 
reoccurrence could jeopardize security or bring disrepute on the Bureau of Prisons. For example, 
if an employee failed to respond to an emergency, even if that emergency turned out to be a false 
alarm, removal would be appropriate if the deciding official was not convinced that the employee 
would respond promptly to any future emergency. 
4. Where appropriate, consideration may be given to a demotion or other action in lieu of 
removal. 
5. Suspension penalties on this schedule refer to calendar days. Except for emergency 
suspensions and indefinite suspensions, all disciplinary suspensions begin on the first workday of 
the employee's next regularly scheduled work week. 
6. The reckoning period is defined as that period of time following the date management 
becomes aware of the offense, during which that offense can be used to determine the sanction 
for a subsequent offense. 
7. Offenses falling within the reckoning period, even though unrelated, should be considered 
when determining the appropriate action. 
8. Where the deciding official substitutes a letter of reprimand in lieu of a greater proposed 
sanction, the letter of reprimand itself is to be separate from the decision letter and is not to refer 
to the greater sanction proposed.

Program 
RULES EFFECTIVE: 3/15/2007 
1. PURPOSE AND SCOPE. The Bureau of Prisons (Bureau) operates a 
suicide prevention program to assist staff in identifying and 
managing potentially suicidal inmates. Each Warden will ensure 
that a suicide prevention program is implemented consistent with 
this policy. In addition, Wardens will facilitate a discussion 
regarding the issue of suicide at department head meetings, staff 
recalls, lieutenants' meetings, etc., to heighten staff awareness 
about the need to detect and report any changes in inmate 
behavior that might suggest suicidal intent. 
2. SUMMARY OF CHANGES. This re-issuance adds the following new 
procedures for preventing inmate suicides: 
a. Suicide prevention training will include three mock suicide 
emergencies per year, one on each shift. One of these exercises 
must be conducted in the Special Housing Unit (SHU) during the 
morning or evening watch. 
b. Specific minimum criteria that must be included in a 
Suicide Risk Assessment and a Post-Watch Report are delineated. 
c. Designation of a room for suicide watch outside of the 
Health Services area requires written approval of the Regional 
Director. 
d. Specific criteria that exclude an inmate from consideration 
for an inmate companion position are delineated. 
e. Correctional Services will notify Psychology Services when 
an inmate requests protective custody (PC). Psychology Services 
will no longer be required to monitor SENTRY for entry of a PC 
code. 
3. PROGRAM OBJECTIVES. The expected results of this program 
are: 
a. All institution staff will be trained to recognize signs 
and information that may indicate a potential suicide.

b. Staff will act to prevent suicides with appropriate 
sensitivity, supervision, and referrals. 
c. Any inmate clinically found to be suicidal will receive 
appropriate preventive supervision, counseling, and other 
treatment.

6. INSTITUTION SUPPLEMENT. See Section 7a. 
7. POLICY. Each Bureau institution, other than Medical Referral 
Centers (MRCs), will implement a suicide prevention program that 
conforms to the procedures outlined in this policy. Each Bureau 
medical center is to develop specific written procedures 
consistent with the specialized nature of the institution and the 
intent of this policy. 
a. Medical Referral Centers. MRCs serve a unique 
evaluation/treatment function addressing the needs of a wide 
range of inmates, while meeting community standards of care. 
Psychology Services is responsible for developing an Institution 
Supplement that describes local procedures for managing the 
SCMCWWMO 
EFTA00033521
--- PAGE 3 ---
P5324.08 
4/5/2007 
Page 3 
Suicide Prevention Program's components. 
MRC psychologists are to document significant treatment 
information in the Psychological Data System (PDS) so that the 
information is readily available for post-discharge treatment. 
b. Residential Reentry Center Contract Facilities. When 
contracts for outside facilities (including Residential Reentry 
Centers (RRCs)) are used, the Statement of Work will include a 
suicide prevention plan or program that meets accepted Bureau 
standards. 
Community Corrections Managers (CCMs) will monitor contract 
facilities regularly to determine their capability to manage at-
risk populations effectively. The CCM will consult the Regional 
Psychology Services Administrator if questions arise about the 
adequacy of a contract facility's Suicide Prevention Program or 
about the need to transfer a suicidal inmate to a different 
facility. The CCM will contact Central Office Psychology 
Services when there is system-wide or interagency issues. 
In the event of a suicide, all possible evidence and 
documentation will be preserved to provide data and support for 
subsequent investigators doing a psychological reconstruction. 
Ordinarily, the Regional Director will authorize an after-action 
review of a suicide at a RRC, to be conducted by the Regional 
Psychology Administrator. The findings will be documented as a 
Psychological Reconstruction Report as outlined in Attachment A. 
c. Privately-Managed Contract Prisons. Private security 
contract facilities maintain a suicide prevention and 
intervention program in compliance with American Correctional 
Association (ACA) standards. Ordinarily, the Assistant Director, 
Correctional Programs Division, will authorize an after-action 
review of a suicide at a contract private prison, to be conducted 
under the direction of the Central Office Psychology Services 
Administrator. The findings will be documented as a 
Psychological Reconstruction Report as outlined in Attachment A. 
8. PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION. 
a. Program Coordinator. Each institution must have a Program 
Coordinator for the institution's suicide prevention program. 
The Program Coordinator shall be responsible for managing the 
treatment of suicidal inmates and for ensuring that the 
institution's suicide prevention program conforms to the 
guidelines for training, identification, referral, assessment, 
and intervention outlined in this policy. 
Ordinarily, the Chief Psychologist will be the Program 
Coordinator. The Program Coordinator's responsibilities will not 
be delegated to staff other than a doctoral-level psychologist. 
SCMCWWM48 
EFTA00033522
--- PAGE 4 ---
P5324.O8 
4/5/2007 
Page 4 
The Program Coordinator, in conjunction with institution 
executive staff, must ensure that adequate coverage is available 
when he or she is absent from the institution for training, 
annual leave, etc. 
b. Training. While the initial period of incarceration is 
often a critical time for detecting potential suicides, serious 
suicidal crises may arise at any time. Line staff are often the 
first to identify signs of potential suicidal behavior based on 
their frequent interactions with inmates. 
The Program Coordinator is responsible for ensuring that 
appropriate training is available to staff. The Program 
Coordinator will ensure that all staff will be trained 
(ordinarily by psychology services personnel) to recognize signs 
indicative of a potential suicide, the appropriate referral 
process, and suicide prevention techniques. 
Wardens will include discussions of suicide prevention at 
department head meetings, staff recalls, etc., to remind staff of 
the need to observe inmates constantly for signs of suicidal 
behavior. 
1) Training for All Staff. Suicide prevention training 
will be included in the Introduction to Correctional Techniques 
curriculum. Training in local suicide prevention procedures will 
be provided during Institution Familiarization Training and 
Annual Training (AT) at all institutions. 
Training for staff will focus on: 
♦ 
identifying suicide risk factors; 
♦ 
typical inmate profiles of completed suicides; 
♦ 
recognition of potentially suicidal behavior; 
♦ 
appropriate information associated with 
identifying and referring suicidal inmates; 
♦ 
responding to a suicide emergency (e.g., a suicide 
in progress), including location and proper use of 
suicide cut-down tool; and 
♦ 
name of Program Coordinator, location of suicide 
watch room, etc. 
2) Supplemental Speciality Training. The Program 
Coordinator will offer supplemental training to staff having 
frequent inmate contacts. Ordinarily, supplemental specialty 
training for health services staff (i.e., Physician's Assistants, 
Nurse Practitioners, Emergency Medical Technicians, Registered 
SONY_00008449 
EFTA00033523
--- PAGE 5 ---
P5324.08 
4/5/2007 
Page 5 
Nurses), lieutenants, and correctional counselors is offered 
approximately six months after the conclusion of institution AT. 
It is encouraged that this training be provided during regularly 
scheduled meetings when possible. 
3) Supplemental Training for Special Housing Unit (SHU) 
Staff. Information about recognizing potentially suicidal 
inmates and procedures to follow will be included in the SHU post 
orders. Attachment B is an example of post orders for suicide 
prevention in a SHU. 
4) Emergency Response Training. At a minimum, the Captain 
and Chief Psychologist will jointly conduct three mock suicide 
emergencies yearly, one on each shift, approximately four months 
apart. Complexes will complete the exercises separately at each 
institution within the complex. 
♦ 
Within the calendar year, at least one of these 
exercises will be conducted in the SHU during the 
evening or morning watch. (Institutions that do 
not have a SHU [e.g., Camps] are exempted from 
this requirement, but are still required to 
conduct three mock suicide emergencies yearly). 
♦ 
Confirmation of mock suicide emergency training 
will occur in writing to the Associate Warden over 
Psychology Services with a copy to the Suicide 
Prevention Program Coordinator for placement in a 
training documentation file. See sample 
memorandum format in Attachment C. 
♦ 
This training is in addition to the supplemental 
speciality training for lieutenants, health 
services staff, and correctional counselors. 
9. IDENTIFICATION OF AT-RISK INMATES. 
a. Medical Staff Screening. Medical staff are to screen a 
newly admitted inmate for signs that the inmate is at risk for 
suicide. Ordinarily, this screening is to take place within 
twenty-four hours of the inmate's admission to the institution. 
♦ The Physician's Assistant/Nurse Practitioner (PA/NP) 
will refer suicidal or emotionally disturbed inmates on 
an emergency basis to the Program Coordinator or 
designee. 
b. Psychological Intake. 
1) 
Pre-Trial Detainees, Pre-Sentence Detainees, and 
Holdovers in MCCs, MDCs, FDCs, FTCs, or Jails. Because of the 
high rate of admissions and short length of stay in MCCs, MDCs, 
SONY_00008450 
EFTA00033524
--- PAGE 6 ---
P5324.08 
4/5/2007 
Page 6 
FDCs, FTCs and Detention units, the comprehensive psychological 
intake conducted by Psychology Services ordinarily will be 
performed only on inmates who are suspected of being suicidal or 
appear psychologically unstable (e.g., mental illness or 
significant substance abuse withdrawal), or who request services 
via the Psychology Services Inmate Questionnaire. 
2) Newly Assigned or Writ-Return Inmates. For newly 
assigned designated inmates or writ-return inmates, a 
psychologist will conduct a comprehensive psychological intake 
within 14 days of the inmate's admission to the institution. 
3) Transferred Inmates. For transferred inmates, a 
psychologist will conduct a comprehensive psychological intake 
within 30 days of the inmate's admission to the institution if 
the psychologist determines it is clinically warranted based upon 
the PSIQ and other available inmate records. 
c. Inmates in SHUs. Inmates in Administrative Detention or 
Disciplinary Segregation status often may be at higher risk for 
suicidal behavior. Inmates being transferred into the SHU will 
be monitored for signs of potential suicide risk (e.g., crying, 
emotionally distraught, threats of self-harm, or engaging in 
misconduct to purposefully effect removal from the general 
population). Inmates exhibiting such behavior will be referred 
to the Shift Lieutenant. 
1) Protective Custody (PC) Inmates. Inmates requesting 
protective custody or demanding to be housed alone may actually 
be contemplating suicide. When an inmate requests protective 
custody or demands to be celled alone, Correctional Services 
staff will immediately: 
♦ 
notify the Program Coordinator or designee in 
Psychology Services during normal business hours, or 
♦ during non-routine working hours notify the on-call 
psychologist. 
The PC inmate should be screened for suicidal ideation within 72 
hours of being placed into SHU. When clinically indicated by 
this screening, a formal Suicide Risk Assessment will be 
conducted. 
The Program Coordinator will work closely with custody staff to 
monitor each PC inmate's mental status for behavior (e.g., 
hopelessness, anxiety, increasing agitation, depression, 
psychoses) that suggests a need for an increased level of 
services. 
2) Inmates Requiring Special Precautions. The Program 
Coordinator will provide SHU staff with a list ("hot list") of 
SONY_00008451 
EFTA00033525
--- PAGE 7 ---
P5324.08 
4/5/2007 
Page 7 
inmates with mental health conditions who may become dangerous, 
self-destructive, or suicidal when placed into the SHU. 
♦ 
This list will be updated as needed and 
distributed to Correctional Services, Health 
Services, and Unit Team staff. This list will be 
made available to all staff. 
♦ 
When an inmate on this "hot list" is placed into 
the SHU, a Correctional Services Supervisor will 
notify Psychology Services immediately. 
3) SHU Custodial Issues. 
A) Program Coordinator Involvement. At a minimum, the 
Program Coordinator or designee will make weekly rounds of SHUs 
and consult with staff in those areas concerning any inmates 
needing special attention. 
B) Review of Lieutenant's Log. The Program Coordinator 
will review the Lieutenant's log each working day to determine if 
an inmate with mental health problems has been placed in the SHU. 
A psychologist will see the inmate as soon as possible to assess 
the inmate's mental status and alert SHU staff. 
C) Health Services. Health Services policy contains 
procedures to ensure inmates placed in SHU continue to received 
needed medications. 
♦ 
Psychology Services will be notified whenever an 
inmate refuses or misses his/her medication. If 
the inmate has the potential to become violent, 
self-destructive, or suicidal without the 
medication, psychologists will notify SHU staff of 
this. 
D) Suicide Rescue Tool. Every SHU will be equipped with 
a suicide rescue tool(s) that is sharp, stored in a secure 
location, and readily available. All SHU staff will be trained 
to use the tool and in the procedures for responding to a suicide 
emergency. 
E) Inmate Removal from the SHU. The Program Coordinator 
will arrange to have an inmate exhibiting significant potential 
for suicide removed from the SHU and placed on suicide watch. 
Ordinarily, once the crisis is over, the inmate will be returned 
to the SHU to satisfy any sanction that was imposed. 
d. Staff Referral. Any staff may identify an inmate as 
potentially suicidal at any time based upon the inmate's observed 
behavior.

Page 9 
STAFF MUST NEVER TAKE LIGHTLY ANY INMATE SUICIDE 
THREATS OR ATTEMPTS OR ANY INFORMATION OR HINTS FROM 
OTHER INMATES ABOUT AN INMATE BEING POTENTIALLY 
SUICIDAL. 
Any staff member who has reason to believe an inmate may be 
suicidal should: 
♦ 
ordinarily maintain the inmate under direct, continuous 
observation, 
♦ 
contact the Shift Lieutenant for assistance, and 
♦ 
during regular working hours, contact the Program 
Coordinator or designee (i.e., any other available 
psychologist). 
♦ 
During non-routine working hours, the Shift Lieutenant 
will contact the on-call psychologist and continue 
direct, continuous observation, or immediately place 
the inmate on suicide watch. 
In emergency situations, the Shift Lieutenant will immediately 
place the inmate on suicide watch. It should be noted that in 
emergency situations any staff member may place an inmate on 
suicide watch. Special procedures may apply to MRCs where the 
initiation of suicide watch may be limited to specific clinical 
staff. 
e. Inmate Referral. In addition to staff, inmates can play a 
vital role in helping to prevent inmate suicides. To facilitate 
this process each institution will encourage inmate referrals by: 
♦ 
including a statement in the institution inmate 
handbook/orientation materials encouraging inmates to 
notify staff of any behavior or situation that may 
suggest an inmate is upset and potentially suicidal, 
♦ 
incorporating the topic of inmate referrals into the 
Admissions and Orientation lesson plan for Psychology 
Services, 
♦ 
placing posters in each housing unit addressing the 
topic, and 
♦ 
ensuring that the information is made available to 
inmates in multiple languages as appropriate, 
particularly Spanish.

10. SUICIDE RISK ASSESSMENT OF IDENTIFIED INMATES. During 
regular working hours inmates referred for assessment of suicide 
potential will be seen on a priority basis. During non-regular 
hours, the Program Coordinator or designee should consult with 
institution staff and may choose to see the inmate immediately or 
have the inmate placed on suicide watch. In either case, the 
inmate will receive an individual assessment within 24 hours of 
referral. 
A Suicide Risk Assessment will be completed when: 
♦ 
staff refer an inmate to Psychology Services because 
the inmate may be at risk for suicide (e.g., the inmate 
refuses his or her property, talks about ending his or 
her life), 
♦ 
an inmate's written or verbal behavior is suggestive of 
suicide, 
♦ 
an inmate exhibits behavior suggestive of self-harm, or 
♦ 
any other condition is present that would lead the 
clinician to believe an assessment is warranted. 
Ordinarily, the Suicide Risk Assessment will be completed in PDS 
within 24 hours of the incidents outlined above. At a minimum, 
the Suicide Risk Assessment will include: 
♦ 
reason for / source of referral, 
♦ 
risk factors assessed, 
♦ 
risk assessment findings, 
♦ 
diagnosis, and 
♦ 
follow-up recommendations. 
When a staff member has made a referral based on observed 
behavior, the psychologist who interviews the inmate will also 
make every effort to interview the staff member who observed the 
behavior. The staff member's comments will be included in the 
report/clinical notes. 
11. INTERVENTION. Upon completion of the suicide risk 
assessment, the Program Coordinator or designee will determine 
the appropriate intervention that best meets the needs of the 
inmate. Because deliberate self-injurious behavior does not 
necessarily reflect suicidal intent, a variety of interventions 
other than placing an inmate on suicide watch may be deemed 
appropriate by the Program Coordinator, such as heightened staff 
or inmate interaction, a room/cell change, greater observation, 
SDNY_00008455 
EFTA00033529
--- PAGE 11 ---
P5324.08 
4/5/2007 
Page 11 
placement in restraints, or referral for psychotropic medication. 
In any case, the Program Coordinator or designee will assume 
responsibility for the recommended intervention and clearly 
document the rationale. 
a. Non-suicidal Inmates. If the Program Coordinator 
determines that the inmate does not appear imminently suicidal, 
he/she shall document in writing the basis for this conclusion 
and any treatment recommendations made. This documentation will 
be placed in the inmate's medical, psychology, and central file. 
b. Suicidal Inmates. If the Program Coordinator determines 
the individual to have an imminent potential for suicide, the 
inmate will be placed on suicide watch in the institution's 
designated suicide prevention room. The actions and findings of 
the Program Coordinator will be documented, with copies going to 
the central file, medical record, psychology file, and the 
Warden. 
12. SUICIDE WATCH. 
a. Housing. Each institution must have one or more rooms 
designated specifically for housing an inmate on suicide watch. 
The designated room must allow staff to maintain adequate control 
of the inmate without compromising the ability to observe and 
protect the inmate. 
♦ The primary concern in designating a room for suicide watch 
must be the ability to observe, protect, and maintain 
adequate control of the inmate. 
♦ The room must permit easy access, privacy, and unobstructed 
vision of the inmate at all times. 
♦ The suicide prevention room may not have fixtures or 
architectural features that would easily allow self-injury. 
Inmates on watch will be placed in the institution's designated 
suicide prevention room, a non-administrative 
detention/segregation cell ordinarily located in the health 
services area. Despite the cell's location, the inmate will not 
be admitted as an in-patient unless there are medical indications 
that would necessitate immediate hospitalization. 
Placement of a suicide watch room in a different area may be 
warranted given the unique features of some institutions. 
♦ However, designating a room for suicide watch outside of the 
Health Services area requires written approval of the 
Regional Director. Such rooms must meet all of the 
requirements identified above. 
SCMCWWM% 
EFTA00033530

P5324.08 
4/5/2007 
Page 12 
♦ Administrative detention and disciplinary segregation cells 
will not be designated or approved as suicide watch cells. 
♦ Under emergency conditions a suicidal inmate may be placed 
temporarily on suicide watch in a cell other than the 
institution's designated watch room. The inmate must be 
moved to a designated suicide watch room as soon as one 
becomes available. 
b. Conditions of Confinement. While on suicide watch, the 
inmate's conditions of confinement will be the least restrictive 
available to ensure control and safety. 
The inmate on watch will ordinarily be seen by the Program 
Coordinator on at least a daily basis. Unit staff will have 
frequent contact with the inmate while he/she is on watch. 
Ordinarily, the Program Coordinator or designee will interview or 
monitor each inmate on suicide watch at least daily and record 
clinical notes following each visit. 
The Program Coordinator or designee will specify the type of 
personal property, bedding, clothing, magazines, that may be 
allowed. 
♦ 
If approved by the Warden, restraints may be applied if 
necessary to obtain greater control, but their use must be 
clearly documented and supported. 
♦ Any deviations from prescribed suicide watch conditions may 
be made only with the Program Coordinator's concurrence. 
♦ The Program Coordinator will develop local procedures to 
ensure timely notification to the inmate's Unit Manager when 
a suicide watch is initiated and terminated. Correctional 
Services staff, in consultation with the Program Coordinator 
or designee, will be responsible for the inmate's daily 
custodial care, cell, and routine activities. 
♦ Unit Management staff in consultation with the Program 
Coordinator will continue to be responsive to routine needs 
while the inmate is on suicide watch. 
c. Observation. For all suicide watches: 
♦ 
Any visual observation techniques used to monitor the 
suicide companion program will focus on the inmate 
companion and/or the inmate on suicide watch only. 
♦ 
The observer and the suicidal inmate will not be in the 
same room/cell and will have a locked door between 
them. 
♦ 
The person performing the suicide watch must have a 
means to summon help immediately (e.g., phone, radio) 
WW_00008457 
EFTA00033531
--- PAGE 13 ---
P5324.08 
4/5/2007 
Page 13 
if the inmate displays any suicidal or unusual 
behavior. 
♦ 
The Program Coordinator will establish procedures 
documenting observations of the inmate's behavior 
Suicide Watch log book, which will be maintained as a 
secure document. Staff and inmate observers will 
document in separate log books. Post Orders will 
provide direction to staff on requirements for 
documentation. 
for 
in a 
1) Staff Observers. The suicide watch may be conducted 
using staff observers. Staff assigned to a suicide watch must 
have received training (Introduction to Correctional Techniques 
or in AT) and must review and sign the Post Orders before 
starting the watch. The Program Coordinator will review the Post 
Orders annually to ensure their accuracy. 
2) Inmate Observers. Only the Warden may authorize the use 
of inmate observers (inmate companion program). The 
authorization for the use of inmate companions is to be made by 
the Warden on a case-by-case basis. If the Warden authorizes a 
companion program, the Program Coordinator will be responsible 
for the selection, training, assignment, and removal of 
individual companions. Inmates selected as companions are 
considered to be on an institution work assignment when they are 
on their scheduled shift and shall receive performance pay for 
time spent monitoring a potentially suicidal inmate. 
d. Watch Termination and Post-Watch Report. Based upon 
clinical findings, the Program Coordinator or designee will: 
1) Remove the inmate from suicide watch when the inmate is 
no longer at imminent risk for suicide, or 
2) Arrange for the inmate's transfer to a medical referral 
center or contract health care facility. 
Once an inmate has been placed on watch, the watch may not be 
terminated, under any circumstance, without the Program 
Coordinator or designee performing a face-to-face evaluation. 
Only the Program Coordinator will have the authority to remove an 
inmate from suicide watch. Generally, the post-watch report 
should be completed in PDS prior to terminating the watch, or as 
soon as possible following watch termination, to ensure 
appropriate continuity of care. Copies of the report will be 
forwarded to the central file, medical record, psychology file, 
and the Warden. There should be a clear description of the 
resolution of the crisis and guidelines for follow-up care. 
SDNY_00008458 
EFTA00033532
--- PAGE 14 ---
P5324.08 
4/5/2007 
Page 14 
At a minimum, the post-watch report will include: 
♦ 
risk factors assessed, 
♦ 
changes in risk factors since the onset of watch, 
♦ 
reasons for removal from watch, and 
♦ 
follow-up recommendations. 
13. INMATE OBSERVERS - INMATE COMPANION PROGRAM. 
a. Selection of Inmate Observers. Because of the very 
sensitive nature of such assignments, the selection of inmate 
observers requires considerable care. To provide round-the-clock 
observation of potentially suicidal inmates, a sufficient number 
of observers should be trained, and alternate candidates should 
be available. 
Observers will be selected based upon their ability to perform 
the specific task but also for their reputation within the 
institution. In the Program Coordinator's judgement, they must 
be mature, reliable individuals who have credibility with both 
staff and inmates. They must be able, in the Program 
Coordinator's judgement, to protect the suicidal inmate's privacy 
from other inmates, while being accepted in the role by staff. 
Finally, in the Program Coordinator's judgement, they must be 
able to perform their duties with minimal need for direct 
supervision. 
In addition, any inmate who is selected as a companion must not: 
♦ 
Be in pre-trial status or a contractual boarder; 
♦ 
Have been found to have committed a 100-level 
prohibited act within the last three years; or 
♦ 
Be in FRP, GED, or Drug Ed Refuse status. 
b. Inmate Observer Shifts. Observers ordinarily will work a 
four-hour shift. Except under unusual circumstances, observers 
will not work longer than one five-hour shift in any 24-hour 
period. Inmate observers will receive performance pay for time 
on watch. 
c. Training Inmate Observers. Each observer will receive at 
least four hours of initial training before being assigned to a 
suicide watch observer shift. Each observer will also receive at 
least four hours of training semiannually. Each training session 
will review policy requirements and instruct the inmates on their 
duties and responsibilities during a suicide watch, including: 
♦ 
the location of suicide watch areas; 
♦ 
summoning staff during all shifts; 
SDNY_00008459 
EFTA00033533
--- PAGE 15 ---
P5324.08 
4/5/2007 
Page 15 
♦ 
recognizing behavioral signs of stress or agitation; 
and 
♦ 
recording observations in the suicide watch log. 
d. Meetings with Program Coordinator. Observers will meet at 
least quarterly with the Program Coordinator or designee to 
review procedures, discuss issues, and supplement training. 
After inmates have served as observers, the Program Coordinator 
or designee will debrief them, individually or in groups, to 
discuss their experiences and make program changes, if necessary. 
e. Records. The Program Coordinator will maintain a file 
containing: 
♦ 
An agreement of understanding and expectations signed 
by each inmate observer; 
♦ 
Documentation of attendance and topics discussed at 
training meetings; 
♦ 
Lists of inmates available to serve as observers, which 
will be available to Correctional Services personnel 
during non-regular working hours; and 
♦ 
Verification of pay for those who have performed 
watches. 
f. Supervision of Inmate Observer During a Suicide watch. 
Although observers will be selected on the basis of their 
emotional stability, maturity, and responsibility, they still 
require some level of staff supervision while performing a 
suicide watch. 
♦ 
This supervision will be provided by staff who are in 
the immediate area of the suicide watch room or who 
have continuous video observation of the inmate 
observer. 
♦ 
In all cases, when an inmate observer alerts staff to 
an emergency situation, staff must immediately respond 
to the suicide watch room and take necessary action to 
prevent the inmate on watch from incurring debilitating 
injury or death. In no case will an inmate observer be 
assigned to a watch without adequate provisions for 
staff supervision or without the ability to obtain 
immediate staff assistance. 
THE DECISION TO USE INMATE OBSERVERS MUST BE PREDICATED 
ON THE FACT THAT IT TAKES ONLY THREE TO FOUR MINUTES 
FOR MANY SUICIDE DEATHS TO OCCUR.

♦ 
Supervision must consist of at least 60-minute checks 
conducted in-person. Staff will initial the 
chronological log upon conducting checks. 
g. Removal. The Program Coordinator or designee may remove 
any observer from the program at his/her discretion. Removal of 
an inmate observer should be documented in the records kept by 
the Program Coordinator. 
14. TRANSFER OF INMATES TO OTHER INSTITUTIONS. 
The Program 
Coordinator will be responsible for making emergency referrals of 
suicidal inmates to the appropriate medical center. No inmate 
who is determined to be imminently suicidal will be transferred 
to another institution, except to a medical center on an 
emergency basis. 
a. Medical Center Referral. Inmates who do not respond to 
treatment interventions and remain imminently suicidal require 
emergency hospitalization. Although a psychiatric referral may 
be indicated at any time, ordinarily the inmate shall be referred 
to a MRC after he or she has been on continuous watch for 72 
hours. If the watch exceeds 72 continuous hours, the Program 
Coordinator must: 
♦ 
Contact the Regional Psychology Administrator to 
discuss the case and determine if an emergency transfer 
is appropriate. 
♦ 
If the decision is not to transfer the inmate to a MRC, 
the rationale for not initiating a request for 
emergency transfer must be documented in the PDS. 
b. Psychology Services at BMWs. 
Psychology Services at each 
MRC will provide an appropriate intervention program for inmates 
who have been admitted for suicidal behavior. The program will 
include: 
♦ 
assessment, 
♦ 
therapeutic interventions, and 
♦ 
discharge planning. 
The discharge planning may include a request to designate an 
institution for the inmate that can provide the custody and level 
of psychological service needed to prevent re-hospitalization. 
c. Consultations. As part of the referral consideration 
process, it may be beneficial to consult with other mental health 
resources, MRC staff, or the Regional Psychology Services 
Administrator. 
♦ 
To ensure maximum communication and tracking of 
suicidal inmates, the Program Coordinator will notify 
SCMCWWM61 
EFTA00033535
--- PAGE 17 ---
P5324.08 
4/5/2007 
Page 17 
his or her Regional Psychology Administrator when a 
suicide watch is begun or terminated and when a suicide 
watch exceeds 72 hours. 
♦ 
The Program Coordinator or designee will document the 
referral considerations and all actions taken in the 
inmate's PDS record. 
d. SENTRY "Psych Alert" Assignments. It is critically 
important that other institutions are notified when they are to 
receive inmates with recent suicidal indications and are at risk 
for self-harm. 
♦ 
The Program Coordinator must ensure that a suicidal 
inmate being transferred to a MRC is given the SENTRY 
"Psych Alert" assignment to signal all staff that 
serious psychological management problems and 
"continuity of care" issues are present. 
15. ANALYSIS OF SUICIDES. If an inmate suicide does occur, the 
Program Coordinator will immediately notify the Regional 
Administrator, Psychology Services. 
The suicide scene will be treated in a manner consistent with an 
inmate death investigation. All measures necessary to preserve 
and document the evidence needed to support subsequent 
investigations will be maintained or otherwise recorded 
adequately. 
♦ 
In the event of a suicide, institution staff, particularly 
Correctional Services staff, and other law enforcement 
personnel, will handle the site with the same level of 
protection as any crime scene in which a death has occurred. 
♦ All possible evidence and documentation will be preserved to 
provide data and support for subsequent investigators doing 
a psychological reconstruction. 
Ordinarily, the Regional Director will authorize an after-action 
review of the suicide to be completed by a psychologist from 
another institution or administrative office. Psychologists who 
have previously been involved in treatment of the inmate or in 
peer consultation in the case shall not participate in the 
suicide reconstruction. The report will address all the areas 
listed in the "Guide for the Psychological Reconstruction of an 
Inmate Suicide" (Attachment A). 
The Regional Psychology Administrator will also review the 
Mortality Review Report prepared by Health Services for 
additional information and to explain any discrepancies with the 
Psychological Reconstruction Report.

a. Central Office Review. The Regional Director will forward 
copies of the Psychological Reconstruction Report to: 
♦ 
the Assistant Director, Correctional Programs Division; 
♦ 
the Assistant Director, Health Services Division; and 
♦ 
the Senior Deputy Assistant Director, Program Review 
Division. 
b. Special Review Committee. The PRD Senior Deputy Assistant 
Director will submit the report to the Special Review Committee. 
The Special Review Committee will review the report and assess 
whether recommendations for corrective action will be addressed 
at the national or local institution level. 
♦ 
The PRD Senior Deputy Assistant Director will be 
responsible for tracking corrective actions and 
verifying the corrective action is accomplished. 
16. CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS. Federal Regulations appear in 
bracketed bold text, as reproduced from volume 28 of the Code of 
Federal Regulations, Chapter 5. The federal regulations that 
bind Bureau staff to specific program practices are primarily 
intended to describe Bureau programs and inmate rights, 
privileges, or responsibilities to inmates and members of the 
public. 
[§ 552.40 Purpose and scope. 
The Bureau of Prisons (Bureau) operates a suicide prevention 
program to assist staff in identifying and managing potentially 
suicidal inmates. When staff identify an inmate as being at risk 
for suicide, staff will place the inmate on suicide watch. Based 
upon clinical findings, staff will either terminate the suicide 
watch when the inmate is no longer at imminent risk for suicide 
or arrange for the inmate's transfer to a medical referral center 
or contract health care facility. 
§ 552.41 Program procedures. 
(a) Program Coordinator. 
Each institution must have a 
Program Coordinator for the institution's suicide prevention 
program. 
(b) Training. 
The Program Coordinator is responsible for 
ensuring that appropriate training is available to staff and to 
inmates selected as inmate observers. 
(c) Identification of at risk inmates. 
(1) Medical staff are to screen a newly admitted inmate for 
signs that the inmate is at risk for suicide. Ordinarily, this 
screening is to take place within twenty-four hours of the 
inmate's admission to the institution. 
SDNv_00008463 
EFTA00033537
--- PAGE 19 ---
P5324.08 
4/5/2007 
Page 19 
(2) Staff (whether medical or non-medical) may make an 
identification at any time based upon the inmate's observed 
behavior. 
(d) Referral. 
Staff who identify an inmate to be at risk 
for suicide will have the inmate placed on suicide watch. 
(e) Assessment. 
A psychologist will clinically assess each 
inmate placed on suicide watch. 
(f) Intervention. 
Upon completion of the clinical 
assessment, the Program Coordinator or designee will determine 
the appropriate intervention that best meets the needs of the 
inmate. 
§ 552.42 Suicide watch conditions. 
(a) Housing. 
Each institution must have one or more rooms 
designated specifically for housing an inmate on suicide watch. 
The designated room must allow staff to maintain adequate control 
of the inmate without compromising the ability to observe and 
protect the inmate. 
(b) Observation.
(1) Staff or trained inmate observers operating in scheduled 
shifts are responsible for keeping the inmate under constant 
observation. 
(2) Only the Warden may authorize the use of inmate 
observers. 
(3) Inmate observers are considered to be on an institution 
work assignment when they are on their scheduled shift. 
(c) Suicide watch log. 
Observers are to document 
significant observed behavior in a log book. 
(d) Termination. 
Based upon clinical findings, the Program 
Coordinator or designee will: 
(1) Remove the inmate from suicide watch when the inmate is 
no longer at imminent risk for suicide, or 
(2) Arrange for the inmate's transfer to a medical referral 
center or contract health care facility.]

SUICIDE PREVENTION INFORMATION 
SPECIAL HOUSING UNIT ADDENDUM TO POST ORDERS 
BOP HIGH RISK GROUPS 
♦ 
New Inmates - The first few hours and days after admission 
can be critical. Newly incarcerated inmates may experience 
feelings such as shame, guilt, fear, sadness, anger, 
agitation, depression, relationship problems, legal 
concerns, hopelessness, and helplessness, which can 
contribute to increased suicide risk. 
♦ 
Protective Custody - Inmates who volunteer to enter 
protective custody are at high risk for suicide, especially 
during the first 72 hours in SHU. These inmates should be 
referred to psychology services immediately. 
♦ 
Long-term Protective Custody Inmates - These inmates are 
particularly vulnerable to depression that can lead to a 
suicide attempt, and should be monitored closely while they 
are in SHU. 
♦ 
Inmates Taking Medication for Mental Health Reasons - These 
inmates are vulnerable to developing suicidal thoughts and 
attempting suicide by overdosing on their medication. 
Inmates on medication should be monitored to make sure they 
are not hoarding medication. Any signs of distress, 
deterioration in hygiene, or sudden changes in behavior 
should be reported to psychology. 
FACTORS THAT CAN INCREASE THE PROBABILITY THAT AN INMATE 
MAY BECOME SUICIDAL: 
♦ 
Mental Health Factors 
History of mental illness 
1. 
Is the inmate depressed, actively psychotic? 
2. 
Has the inmate been compliant with psychotropic 
medication? 
3. 
Have there been changes in eating, sleeping, hygiene, 
weight, recreation, activity level? 
Prior suicide attempt 
1. 
How lethal was the attempt? 
2. 
How many attempts have been made? 
SCMCWWM67 
EFTA00033541
--- PAGE 23 ---
P5324.O8 
4/5/2007 
Attachment B, Page 2 
Inmate's current mood, affect, and behavior 
1. 
Is the inmate emotionally upset, angry, easily 
agitated? 
2. 
Are the inmate's thoughts clear and goal directed (vs. 
delusional or psychotic in nature)? 
3. 
Is the inmate depressed, has there been a recent loss? 
4. 
Has hopelessness persisted even after the 
depression has lifted? 
5. 
Has the inmate given away property, revised a will, 
requested a phone call to say his goodbyes? 
♦ 
Medical Condition(s)/Chronic Pain 
1. 
Does the inmate have a chronic life threatening medical 
illness? 
2. 
Has the inmate's overall health diminished recently? 
3. 
Is the inmate experiencing pain or other negative 
symptoms? 
♦ 
Relationship Difficulties 
1. 
Has the inmate received a Dear John letter? 
2. 
Have communications and or visits decreased? 
3. 
Has there been a change in the relationship? 
♦ 
Situational Factors 
1. 
Legal issues - pending indictment; loss of appeal to 
reduce sentence. 
2. 
Difficulties with staff or other inmates. 
3. 
Gambling debts, drugs. 
4. 
Ending of a close relationship with another inmate. 
D. 
Possible victim of a sexual assault. 
REPORTING AND DOCUMENTING INMATE BEHAVIOR 
♦ 
Report Your Concerns - Any inmate behavior(s) that is 
questionable and may reflect a change in mental health 
status should be reported to the Shift Lieutenant 
immediately. 
♦ 
During non-working hours - Inform the Shift Lieutenant of 
any questionable inmate behavior. He/she will determine if 
the on-call psychologist needs to be contacted. 
♦ 
Segregation Log Book - Any changes in inmate behaviors 
should be noted in the log book. A detailed note regarding 
the observed behavior is advisable. Documenting in the log 
book serves two purposes. First, the entry serves as a 
means of communication for other staff members. Second, it 
provides an accurate account of activity during your shift. 
Documentation should be neat, legible, and professional.

RESPONDING TO A SUICIDE EMERGENCY 
♦ 
A Segregation Officer observing an inmate in the act of 
committing suicide, causing other self-injurious behavior, 
or who appears to have committed suicide will call for back-
up before entering the cell. The officer will notify the 
Control Center and the Lieutenant's Office by radio of the 
situation and request immediate back-up. BACK-UP MUST BE 
PRESENT IN ORDER TO ENTER A CELL. 
♦ 
The "cut-down" tool is located in the storage closet on a 
shadow board. It is the #1 officer's responsibility to 
locate this item at the start of the shift. This tool is 
only authorized to be used in emergency situations. 
Miscellaneous use of this tool is not permitted and will 
result in dulling the blade of the tool. 
♦ 
In the event an inmate commits suicide, the scene of the 
suicide will be treated in a manner consistent with the 
investigation of an inmate death. All measures necessary to 
preserve and document the evidence needed to support 
subsequent investigations will be maintained or otherwise 
adequately recorded.

With apologies for the weekend email, we have a defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, who was arrested last night and is currently bein 
g detained at MCC, and is expected to be presented on an indictment tomorrow. His attorney, Martin Weinberg, has represe 
nted him in the past, and represents him in connection with our case and has been in touch with us throughout the weekend. 
He went to MCC today to meet with him in advance of the presentment tomorrow, but was just told he is not allowed in beca 
use he is from out-of-state. 
We're concerned about the defendant not having access to his attorney in advance of the presentment (as we would be for any 
defendant) and so I wanted to reach out to you-
is it at all 
ssible to address this issue so Mr. Weinberg can meet with his client this eveniwil'm available anytime at 
to discuss, if that's helpful, or Mr. Weinberg can also be reached directly at 
if that's easier (though if you reach out directly to him if you could please just let me know afterward I'd be grateful). 
thanks very much,

Good Morning: 
I would like to confirm the accuracy that management has approved that the above inmate's meals be 
delivered from the housing unit, for every feeding, to Attorney Conference? 
Additionally, is it correct that management has instructed that the inmate be escorted to the restroom 
every hour without being restrained, despite being a SHU inmate? 
Has the process changed for all inmates? If not, this is clear preferential treatment of an inmate. All other 
inmates who are in attorney conference or attending court during feeding, are provided a bagged lunch 
which is sent up from food service every morning. 
Please provide a response.

I visited inmate Epstein in SHU on Thursday. He was getting ready to meet with his attorneys for the day so I had 
gone to visit him right after the SHU meeting. He had a cell mate at the time with whom I saw him interact 
with. He did not report any mental health concerns and he denied any suicidal thoughts or intention. He was 
asking this writer to go to general population and was making requests for various needs he had at the time. 
He wanted social calls without them being on a speaker phone. He wanted a book he had left in the suicide 
watch area. His mood was not depressed or anxious. There were no signs of distress. He had planned on 
meeting with his attorneys to work on his legal situation.

As I was doing the 10:00 PM count, I notice this inmate distraught, sad and a little confused. I asked him if he was ok? he said, "that 
he's ok." but I am not convinced because he seems dazed and withdrawn. So just to be on the safe side and prevent any suicidal 
thoughts can someone from Psychology come and talk with him. I don't know the inmate register number because he is new, he is 
currently on 5 North. I don't know who did his in take, so I am not familiar with any information on this inmate.

New York NY 10007 
OPI: 
NUMBER: 
DATE: 
SUBJECT: 
HSA 
NYM 6031.01C 
April 10, 2007 
Detoxification and Treatment 
Programs 
1. 
PURPOSE: To establish procedures to ensure the Metropolitan Correctional Center, New York, is in 
compliance with federal regulations for methadone detoxification and detoxification from other abuse 
substances, i.e., opiates, alcohol, and narcotics. 
2. 
REFERENCE: Program Statement 6031.01, Health Services Manual, dated January 15, 2005, Drug 
Enforcement Administration (DEA) regulatory controls relating to registration, security and record 
keeping of institutions having a narcotic treatment program. Institutional Supplement 6501.5(A), is 
rescinded. 
3. 
INTRODUCTION: The Clinical Director will establish guidelines for evaluation and treatment of 
inmates who require detoxification from mood and mind altering substances such as alcohol, opiates, 
hypnotics, sedatives, etc. 
The guidelines will include specific detoxification protocols to be implemented upon order of medical 
staff. Treatment and supportive measures will permit withdrawal with minimal physiological and 
physical discomfort. 
Metropolitan Correctional Centers, Metropolitan Detention Centers, Federal Transportation Centers and 
jail units may provide methadone detoxification if clinically indicated. This program requires special 
registration. If an institution has a methadone detoxification program then the institution Chief 
Pharmacist will complete and maintain registration for a methadone program. Methadone is permitted to 
be administered or dispensed only for detoxification or temporary treatment of patients. If Methadone is 
administered for treatment of heroin dependence, for more than three weeks, the procedure passes from 
treatment of the acute withdrawal syndrome (detoxification) to a maintenance program. 
This institution has the authority to conduct only a detoxification program by the Food and Drug 
Administration and has been assigned an identification number. Detoxification suppresses major 
physiological and psychological signs and symptoms of withdrawal. Each inmate possibly needing 
detoxification will be evaluated by the physician for an appropriate detoxification schedule. 
4. 
DEFINITIONS:
A. 
The following are the definitions of terminology used in discussing detoxification: 
CONFIDENTIAL 
SDNY_00009836 
EFTA00034001
--- PAGE 2 ---
I . 
DRUG - A chemical compound or biological substance producing a physiologic effect 
when taken internally. 
2. 
ABUSE OR DRUG ABUSE - The use of a drug for non-medical reasons. Typically this 
use is to satisfy an addiction or habituation or for altering ones perception. 
3. 
ADDICTION - physical dependency on a drug with a characteristic withdrawal or 
abstinence syndrome, leading to chronic use, including narcotics, barbiturates, etc. 
4. 
HABITUATION - Psychologic dependency on a drug leading to chronic use. 
5. 
NARCOTIC - A natural or synthetic opiate drug for pain relief which in increasingly 
larger doses produces dependency. Also, an addictive group of drugs including heroin, 
morphine, methadone, etc. 
6. 
ALCOHOL - Ethyl alcohol in water solution. 
5. 
PROGRAM PARTICIPATION: Inmates on detoxification will not be hospitalized unless deemed 
necessary by medical staff. The medication will be administered on the units by medical staff. The 
physician is to determine the need based on the history; clinical findings, and verification of any 
Methadone Maintenance Program the inmate may have been enrolled in. The physician must document 
this information on the chronological record of medical care. 
6. 
CLASSIFICATIONS: 
A. 
At this facility the classification for treatment includes: 
1. 
All inmates committed with a history of alcohol use or physical findings indicating 
dependency. 
2. 
All inmates committed with a history of drug use or physical findings indicating 
dependency. 
3. 
All inmates discovered to be drug or alcohol dependent during the course of their 
incarceration. 
7. 
CLINICAL ASSESSMENT GUIDELINES: 
A. 
Subjective: 
Subjective withdrawal complaints - presence or absence of: bone and muscle pain, nausea and/or 
vomiting (subjective if not observed), diarrhea. 
B. 
Objective: 
CONFIDENTIAL 
SDNY_00009837 
EFTA00034002
--- PAGE 3 ---
1. 
Pulse, blood pressure, temperature; 
2. 
Presence or absence of: Yawning, restlessness, lacrimation, dilated pupils, hyperactive 
bowel sounds, skin - goose flesh, sweating, jaundice, tracks; 
3. 
Liver size and presence or absence of tenderness 
4. 
Verify patient participation in a MMTP. (Methadone Maintenance Treatment Program). 
5. 
Urinary Dip Stick screening test for Opiates and Methadone 
6. 
Order RPR test for Syphillis screening 
C. 
Assessment: 
1. 
It is the responsibility of all medical staff to identify all inmates who are or may be drug 
dependent by taking a thorough medical history, including a drug history and the 
performance of a complete physical examination as a part of the inmate intake screening 
process. 
2. 
Inmates diagnosed as having either alcohol or drug dependency should be enrolled in the 
following protocol at this facility. 
a. 
Be seen by the medical doctor as soon as possible for determination of: 
1. 
Diagnosis 
2. 
Medical orders including pharmacologic support if deemed necessary. 
3. 
Special precautions to ensure inmate and staff security. 
3. 
After an inmate has been evaluated for methadone detoxification, he or she may be: 
a. 
Only observed because history and physical do not support the need for 
detoxification. These patients will have: 
1. 
Poor history for drug use/withdrawal; 
2. 
No subjective findings; 
3. 
No tracks; or 
4. 
The inmate decides he or she does not want detoxification. 
b. 
Placed on continued observation because subjective and objective findings 
suggest that, though unlikely, it is possible that the inmate will undergo 
withdrawal. Because the length of time between arrest and evaluation for 
methadone detoxification can be in excess of 48 hours, inmates may often fail to 
exhibit the objective signs of opiate withdrawal. The subjective component of the 
opiate withdrawal syndrome, however, persists for up to ten days. Inmates who 
have a history of drug addiction, have evidence of recent drug use (old/new 
tracks), and complain of the subjective symptoms should not be placed on 
CONFIDENTIAL

--- PAGE 4 ---
continued observation, but should be placed on the Methadone Detoxification 
Program. 
c. 
Placed on 7-Day Detoxification because subjective and/or objective findings are 
consistent with acute withdrawal (see above). 
d. 
Placed on 21-Day Detoxification schedule because the inmate was on a verified 
MMTP*. If the program cannot be verified at the time of evaluation, the inmate 
will be started on 7-Day Detoxification whether or not he or she shows drug 
withdrawal signs. When the program is confirmed, the inmate should be 
reexamined and seen by the Clinical Director to determine whether or not he or 
she should be continued on the 7-Day schedule. 
7-DAY PROGRAM 
Day 1= 20 mg. 
Day 2= 20 mg. 
Day 3= 20 mg. 
Day 4= 20 mg. 
Day 5= 10 mg.

D. 
PLAN 
1. 
For inmates who decide they do not want detoxification, a refusal for treatment form must 
be signed. 
2. 
For inmates who will receive methadone (seven or 21 day schedules): 
a. 
Record the information on which the decision was made on the progress note or 
intake physical form. If the inmate is on a MMTP and automatically gets 
methadone, this should also be recorded on the progress note or intake form. 
b. 
Write and sign the order for a methadone 7 or 21-day schedule, whichever is 
applicable, on the medication order sheet (duplicate form). All mid-level 
practitioner orders must be countersigned by a physician prior to administration 
(or a physician telephone order taken). 
c. 
All methadone patients should be given their first dose at the time of intake. Fill 
out the 7-day form and indicate date and time given as day one. If given on the 
next date as a day two. If patient is verified on MMTP, the 21-day schedule 
should begin. 
d. 
If a patient is a late court return, stat medications should be administered. 
e. 
If a patient is verified on a MMTP dosage lower than our 21-day schedule (less 
than 40 mg) the lower dosage should be maintained until the next scheduled 
change, e.g., patient maintained on 30 mg. An order should be written to start 
methadone 21-day detoxification on 30 mg. All higher doses on the 
Administration Record should be crossed-out and replaced with "30 mg." It still 
remains a 21-day detoxification schedule. 
f. 
There are patients who have been on very long term MMTP programs. These 
patients should be evaluated by the Clinical Director or detoxification specialist 
for determination of possibly lengthening the detoxification process on an 
individualized basis. 
g. 
Make appointment for the patient to see a psychologist for counseling. 
h. 
If a patient is on methadone detoxification (7 or 21-day) and confirmation of 
pregnancy is established by both urine and gynecological examination, the patient 
has the option to either detoxify or be maintained on a dosage level to be 
determined by the Clinical Director until completion of pregnancy and/or 
discharge. 
I. 
If patient is discharged during the course of pregnancy, a psychologist should be 
called to help counseling. 
j. 
It should be explained to the patient that pregnant opiate users are to be 
maintained on low doses of methadone after the first trimester. Detoxification can 
possibly cause damage to the fetus. 
CONFIDENTIAL 
SDNY_00009840 
EFTA00034005
--- PAGE 6 ---
k. 
Patients must sign a consent form for methadone. If the patient is past the first 
trimester and refuses methadone, a Refusal of Treatment Form must be signed. 
1. 
All patients who have histories of drug abuse, even if not placed on a 
detoxification program, should be encouraged to have a counseling session 
regarding realistic plans post discharge and/or to seek supportive counseling. The 
psychology staff is available for counseling. If not available in the building they 
can be consulted by telephone for suggestions. In addition, they should be 
consulted when difficulties arise in determining addiction status. 
m. 
In the case of delirium tremens, barbiturate or ethyl alcohol withdrawal or severe 
opiate, withdrawal when the medical doctor is not present in the facility, the 
doctor on call is to be contacted by the ranking medical officer on duty for 
instructions. 
n. 
A list of all inmates currently undergoing detoxification will be maintained and 
updated by the Clinical Director. 
o. 
If the physician feels that the inmate is unable to receive proper care for 
detoxification at this facility, the inmate may be considered and processed for 
transfer in accordance with current Health Services Manual policy. 
p. 
Inmates on detoxification will not be approved for transfer without notifying the 
Clinical Director. 
q. 
Only physicians properly registered with the DEA will prescribe methadone at this 
facility. Under no circumstance will mid-level practitioners prescribe methadone. 
r. 
Inmates will not be transferred prior to completion of the detoxification treatment, 
unless it is to another BOP facility which has a detoxification program. 
11. 
RESPONSIBILITY:. The Health Services Administrator and Clinical Director are assigned the 
responsibility of enforcing regulations pertaining to the Methadone Detoxification Program. 
The Health Services Administrator will establish the policies to assure compliance with the Federal 
Regulations. 
12. 
EFFECTIVE DATE: This Supplement is effective upon issuance.

U.S. Department of Justiee 
Federal Bureau of Prisons 
Metropolitan Correctional Center 
New York, NY 10007 
Institution Supplement 
OPI: 
Psychology Department 
NUMBER: NYM5324.08d 
DATE: 
May 21, 2013 
SUBJECT: Suicide Prevention Program 
1. 
PURPOSE: The prevention of self-destructive behavior is an essential component in the care, custody, 
and control of the inmate population. The procedures outlined below will be implemented to avert the 
loss of life, and to diminish the potential for further suicidal behavior. 
2. 
The stress associated with incarceration, as well as unpredictable stressful events, can result in the 
motivation to commit suicide. Early identification of self-destructive potential in conjunction with 
appropriate physical and mental health interventions and coordinated follow-up can reduce the 
likelihood of injury, fatality, and further self-destructive behavior. 
DIRECTIVES AFFECTED 
Directive Referenced: 
P.S. 5324.08 Suicide Prevention Program, dated April 5, 2007. 
Directive Rescinded: 
NYM 5324.05c, Suicide Prevention Program, dated December I. 2006. 
3. 
RESPONSIBILITIES: The Chief Psychologist or his/her designee is designated as the Suicide 
Prevention Program Coordinator. 
4. 
PROCEDURES: 
A. REFERRAL: All staff shall immediately refer potentially suicidal inmates to Psychology 
Services for evaluation. During non-regular working hours, the inmate will be referred to the 
Operations Lieutenant and the Physician's Assistant on duty. Should the Physician's Assistant 
determine that the inmate is at serious risk for inflicting self-harm, he/she will inform the 
CONFIDENTIAL 
SDNY_00009842 
EFTA00034007
--- PAGE 2 ---
NYM.5324.08d 
Suicide Prevention Program 
Operations Lieutenant, who in turn, will contact the On-Call Psychologist who will determine if 
a suicide watch will be initiated. However, in an emergency situation if a Physician's Assistant 
is not available, any staff member can initiate a suicide watch. The Operations Lieutenant should 
immediately be contacted, who will then immediately contact the On-Call Psychologist. 
Psychology Services Inmate Questionnaire (PSIQ): This form (attachment 1) will be distributed in 
Receiving and Discharge during the intake screening process. Staff (Medical, Psychology, or 
Lieutenants) conducting the psychosocial interview will review the PSIQ for completion, check the 
inmate's response to item #7, i.e., "Are you considering suicide now?" and sign his/her name next to item 
#7. 
Outside of regular working hours and in the absence of any Psychologist at the institution, without 
exception, all inmates endorsing item #7 (current suicidal thoughts) or appearing to be potentially 
suicidal as determined by the staff member conducting the psychosocial interview, will be placed 
on suicide watch, pending direct interview by a Psychologist. The Operations Lieutenant will be 
contacted immediately and he/she will in turn notify the Psychologist as soon as possible about the new 
suicide watch. In the rare case the On-Call psychologist cannot be reached promptly, reasonable efforts 
should be made to contact another Psychologist. If there is a mid-level provider or Physician Assistant 
at the institution during non-routine hours, he/she will be called for further evaluation if the inmate 
endorses item #7, appears highly emotionally distressed, and/or displays unusual behavior (e.g., crying, 
shaking, talking to himself, paranoid, etc.). 
Airing routine working hours, the "duty psychologist" will be called immediately by radio for further 
evaluation of any inmate who endorses item #7, appears highly emotionally distressed, and/or displays 
unusual behavior. Referred inmates should be kept under direct observation of staff  until the 
Psychologist arrives. 
B. MAINTENANCE: When a suicide watch is initiated, the suicidal inmate will be placed under 
continuous visual observation. The following maintenance procedures will be followed: 
When there is an inmate in the institution placed on a suicide watch, the suicide 
watch will be in the 2nd floor suicide prevention area and conducted by inmate 
companions, unless staff are required for the suicide watch. If staff are used for the 
suicide watch, there are Post Orders explaining the suicide watch procedures in 
detail that must be signed by all staff before they assume this post. 
Inmate 
companions may only watch suicidal inmates of the same gender. The Unit 2 
Officer is responsible for making rounds and signing the suicide watch log every 
hour. 
FXCEPTIONS: The following exceptions to the above procedures will apply: 
CONFIDENTIAL 
SDNY_00009843 
EFTA00034008
--- PAGE 3 ---
C. 
NYM.5324.08d 
Suicide Prevention Program 
1. 
All Unit 3 inmates placed on a suicide watch will be observed only on Unit 3 
(cell C02-313) by Unit 3 inmate companions or staff only. 
2. 
If a suicide watch is being conducted in the 2nd floor suicide prevention area, 
an inmate of the opposite gender will not be placed on suicide watch in the 2nd 
floor suicide prevention area. The suicide watch with an inmate of the opposite 
gender will be conducted in an alternate location. See #3 below for the alternate 
locations. Therefore, if there is a male inmate on suicide watch in the suicide 
prevention area and a female inmate suicide watch is initiated, the female 
inmate will be placed on Unit 2 (cell B01-211) with a female inmate 
companion. If there are two female inmates on suicide watch in the suicide 
prevention area and a male inmate suicide watch is initiated, the male inmate 
will be placed on 9 South (Z03-965, H tier, Hard cells #1, #2) on suicide watch 
with a staff member watching the inmate. 
3. 
A suicide watch room waiver has been approved for alternate suicide watch 
rooms when needed other than the 2 suicide watch rooms in the suicide 
prevention area. They are as follows: Unit 2 (cell B01-211), Unit 3 (cell C02-
313), 9 South (cell Z03-965), and 10 South Lower — H tier (Hard cells #1 and 
#2). 
OPERATIONAL, PROCEDURES: 
1. 
Suicide Watch Requirements: Before placing a suicidal inmate in a suicide watch 
room, the room will be thoroughly inspected and the inmate will be strip-searched to 
ensure that he/she does not have access to any items which could be used to injure 
him/herself or others. Normally potentially suicidal inmates will be required to wear a 
suicide watch gown. Unless otherwise specified by the Program Coordinator or her 
designee, the inmate will be allowed a suicide watch blanket. The inmate will never be 
allowed razors, shoelaces, belts, sheets, metal cans, or other sharp objects. In the 
suicide watch log book, there will be a list specifying items that the inmate may be 
allowed in the suicide watch room, as well as any special instructions for the 
management of the inmate on watch. 
2. 
Monitoring and Psychological Interviews of Inmates on Suicide Watch: All 
inmates on Suicide Watch must be observed directly by staff or inmate companions at 
/ILL TIME'S. If inmate companions need to be removed from their Suicide Watch 
posts for any reason, a staff member will immediately assume the Suicide Watch post in 
order to continue direct observation of the inmate in the suicide watch cell. It is a fact, 
as reiterated by national policy; it takes only three to four minutes for many suicide 
deaths to occur. A Psychologist will interview the inmate on suicide watch daily,

Suicide Prevention Program 
including weekends and holidays, and record clinical notes on the Psychology Data 
System (PDS) following each visit. 
3. 
Documentation of Observations of Inmates on Suicide Watch: Observations of the 
inmate's behavior will be documented in a Suicide Watch Log Book, which will be 
maintained as a secure document. As stated by the Suicide Prevention Program 
Statement, staff and inmate observers will document in separate log books. Post Orders 
will provide direction to staff on requirements for documentation (e.g., entering log 
entries at least every 15 minutes). 
4. 
Meals: Inmates on suicide watch will be fed sack meals to prevent their access to hard, 
breakable objects, hard containers, and plastic wrappings. 
5. 
Showers: Showers are allowed for inmates on suicide watch unless specific mental 
health or security concerns are identified by Psychology Services or Correctional 
Services. The Operations Lieutenant will be responsible for supervising and 
coordinating showering procedures. Any showering restrictions, due to security 
concerns, must be directly conveyed to the Operations Lieutenant. Receipt of such 
instructions will be noted in the Suicide Watch Log Book. 
I 
I 
6. 
Searches of Suicide Watch Cells: At a minimum, suicide watch cells will be searched 
once a day, to extract any contraband, items not allowed in the cell, and/or accumulated 
trash. This search will normally be conducted by the Unit Officer during Day Watch, 
supervised by the Operations Lieutenant or designee. The Unit Officer will also search 
the suicide watch cell when the inmate exits the cell to take a shower. 
7. 
Telephone Use: Inmates on suicide watch will not normally be permitted phone calls. 
Very seldom, phone calls may be recommended by Psychology Services staff as these 
phone calls may be deemed potentially beneficial to the inmate's mental health and/or 
may expedite recovery, and do not pose an increased risk for self-harm or harm to 
others. These rare exceptions must be approved by the Captain as well by the Associate 
Warden of Programs. Non-psychology staff recommending phone calls shall consult 
with Psychology Services staff, who if in agreement, will initiate proper procedures. 
8. 
Visits and Recreation: Normally, neither recreation nor visitation (either social or 
legal) are permitted for inmates on suicide watch. Occasionally, visits may be 
recommended by Psychology Services staff, as these visits may be deemed potentially 
beneficial to the inmate's mental health and/or may expedite recovery, and do not pose 
an increased risk for self-harm or harm to others. These rare exceptions must be 
approved by the Captain as well by the Associate Wardens of Programs.

9. 
Emergency Medical Trips: Emergency medical trips will be the responsibility of the 
Operations Lieutenant. 
10. 
Court Trips: Court trips do not require approval from a Psychologist. Therefore, 
ordinarily, all inmates on suicide watch scheduled to go to court must be escorted to 
R&D to go to court. It will be the Operations Lieutenant's responsibility to notify the 
U.S. Marshals Service of any inmate on suicide watch who is scheduled to go to court. 
Any exceptions regarding inmates on suicide watch who are not permitted to go to court 
(i.e., actively suicidal and/or acutely psychotic), will be stated in writing by Psychology 
Services and/or Correctional Services. Every inmate who departs for court on suicide 
watch must beplaced back on suicide watch upon returning to the institution, pending 
re-evaluation by a Psychologist. 
11. 
Escorting Procedures for Inmates on Suicide Watch: All inmates on suicide watch 
will be restrained when moved out of the suicide watch cell for showering, medical 
visits, court appearances, or legal visits. The level or type of restraints will be 
determined by Correctional Services. 
12. 
Termination of Suicide Watches: Once an inmate has been placed on suicide watch, 
the watch may not be terminated, under any circumstance, without a Psychologist 
performing a face-to-face evaluation. Upon termination of a suicide watch, the 
Psychologist will provide the Operations Lieutenant with a memorandum documenting 
the ending of the watch and requesting removal of the inmate from the watch cell. 
13. 
Housing Procedures for Inmates Discharged from Suicide Watch. All inmates 
discharged from suicide watch to a general population unit or the Special Housing Unit 
will be assigned a cellmate. If security and/or safety concerns preclude cellmate 
assignment, the Associate Warden of Programs will be contacted by the staff member 
recommending against cellmate assignment. 
The above procedures are to be strictly adhered to. Any deviation from established 
procedures must first be approved by the Associate Warden Operations and/or Programs. 
D. 
INMATE COMPANIONS: The Program Coordinator will be responsible for the selection, 
training, assignment and removal of individual inmate companions. The following guidelines 
will be required for the use of inmate companions: 
1. 
Male volunteers will be recruited from the sentenced inmates designated to Unit 5S 
and, if needed, pretrial/holdover inmates without separatees from 5 North. Male 
volunteers for the suicide watches on Unit 3 will be recruited from the Unit 3 inmates. 
Female volunteers will be recruited from inmates on Unit 2. All volunteers must be 
approved in advance by the Program Coordinator, who will consult with Unit 2, Unit 3, 
Unit 5S and Unit 5N Unit Managers.

2. 
There will be one inmate companion designated as the Inmate Coordinator on Unit 5S 
and one designated as an Alternate Inmate Coordinator, either on Unit 5S or Unit 5N. 
There will be one inmate companion designated as the Inmate Coordinator on Unit 2. 
The Inmate Coordinator is responsible for maintaining a current schedule of round-the-
clock inmate companion assignments. Daily changes and additions will be maintained 
by the Inmate Coordinator. On Unit 3 there will be only 6 inmate companions and each 
one will be assigned a permanent 4-hour shift. The Inmate Companion schedule will be 
available to the Operations Lieutenant and the Unit 5S, Unit 5N, Unit 3, and Unit 2 
Officers at all times. 
3. 
Once a suicide watch has been initiated, the Operations Lieutenant will contact the Unit 
5S, Unit 3, or Unit 2 Officer/Unit Staff to inform them that inmate companions will be 
used. The Inmate Coordinator will then be notified by the Unit Officer and told to 
inform all inmate companions of their assigned shifts for the next 24 hours. The Inmate 
Coordinator will then maintain round-the-clock assignments of inmate companions for 
as long as the suicide watch remains in effect. If an inmate companion refuses to work 
or cannot work his/her shift because of illness, the Inmate Coordinator is responsible 
for providing a replacement. If the Inmate Coordinator does not fulfill his/her 
responsibility in assigning inmate companions, the Operations Lieutenant will make the 
assignments. 
4. 
Inmate companions will receive one dollar for each hour they monitor a suicide watch 
and forty cents for each hour they attend training classes. Payment will be made on a 
monthly basis. Hours worked and training sessions attended will be recorded by the 
Suicide Prevention Program Coordinator. 
5. 
Inmate companions will be required to work their regular 8-hour work details in 
addition to their 4-hour suicide watch shift. Whenever possible, inmate companions 
will not be scheduled for a suicide watch during their regular work details. If unusual 
circumstances result in a conflict between an inmate companion's suicide watch and his 
work detail, then Unit 5S, Unit 5N or Unit 2 Officer will notify the Detail Supervisor of 
the reason for the inmate's absence. 
E. 
STAFF TRAINING: The Program Coordinator will ensure that all staff will be trained by 
psychology services personnel to recognize signs indicative of a potential suicide, the appropriate 
referral process, and suicide prevention techniques. At a minimum, this will occur during 
Annual Training. 
1. 
Supplemental Specialty Training - Further training with regard to suicide prevention 
will ordinarily be conducted with Health Services staff, Lieutenants, and Correctional 
Counselors approximately six months after Annual Training.

Supplemental Training for SHU Staff - Information about recognizing potentially 
suicidal inmates and procedures to follow will be included in the SHU post orders with 
a separate signature sheet. 
3. 
Emergency Response Training - As indicated by the Suicide Prevention Program 
Statement, the Captain and the Chief Psychologist will conduct three joint mock 
exercises yearly, one on each shift, approximately four months apart. At least one of 
these exercises will take place in the SHU during the evening or morning watch. 
Ordinarily, this exercise will be coordinated between the Captain, and/or Emergency 
Preparedness Officer and the Chief Psychologist.

Good morning Bruce, 
Please be advised that this matter is currently the subject of an open investigation, and, 
thus, I am limited in what I can discuss at this time. I have not shared any information 
with the press or the public, and I am not aware of any other MCC staff doing so 
either. As this is an open investigation, no information can be shared with outside 
parties until the investigation is complete. Once the investigation is concluded, I will be 
able to provide you more information. 
I have reminded MCC administrators to caution staff that they are not to retaliate 
against your client or any inmate. Please let me know if you have any further questions 
or concerns. 
Thank you,

I saw him before his Legal visit. He seems stable and is now at his Legal visit. I'll be coming in tomorrow before his Legal visit to see 
him again. 
He complained about being dehydrated because he stated he cannot drink enough water because of limited bathroom breaks in Legal 
since he stated he sees his Attorney for about 12 hours. 
He also complained about having to go back up to SHU. Being anxious about it and not being able to sleep there because of the noise

Inmate Epstein seems psychologically stable. 
He complained that his right arm was numb and hanging earlier. Nurse 
saw him. 
He again said his right arm still feels somy.fl
iumb and he said he cannot make a fist with that hand. He also said he has 
numbness on his neck. I informed Nurse 
He stated the toilet in his cell was running for 45 minutes last night and he could not take the noise. He is going to try the toilet before 
going to legal today and if it does not shut off, he will be moved to another cell. 
Thanks,

the 5 days before that he had only slept about 30 minutes each night because of noise in SHU. He stated he is anxious about going

happened 
He said he has an appetite and is eating. He said he is waking up every 1 1/2 hours. He stated he feels dehydrated because he is not 
drinking enough water because he stated he feels he is not given enough bathroom breaks while with his Attorney. Medical was e-
mailed with his complaint of feeling dehydrated. He said his Lawyers and friends are all emotionally supportive.

The "Eating/Shower Chart" noted that yesterday he ate breakfast. He is not in the Psych Observation cell for about 12 hours per day 
because of being in Attorney Conference with his Attorneys, so the "Eating/Shower Chart" may not reflect all of his meals. He stated 
he was served one meal in Attorney Conference yesterday. He stated he drinks a lot water at night. The Psych Observation log noted 
he talked about life in general population and he slept. 
Earlier he had complained that his right arm was numb and hanging. Nurse 
from Medical had seen him for this. 
When this writer was interviewing him, he said his right arm still feels somewhat numb and he said he cannot make a fist with that 
hand. He also said he has numbness on his neck. This writer notified Nurse 
He stated last night when he flushed the toilet it kept flushing for 45 minutes. He stated he found it so aversive and upsetting that he 
said he sat in the corner and held his ears. He said because of this he was agitated for hours and was not able to sleep. The Lt. will 
be moving him to a different cell and he was informed of this. He stated the feeling he got with the noise of the toilet was similar to 
when he was in SHU. He said he may have something on the Autism spectrum. He said in the movie "Rain Man," the person with 
Autism had an aversion to noise. He stated he is also really good with numbers

Lt. M, 
He said his cellmate is up all night talking which keeps him awake. When I offered to request a new 
cellmate for him, he stated he will try staying with his current cellmate 3 to 4 more days and will let staff 
know if it is getting too difficult.

Hello, 
I'm a reporter with BuzzFeed News. I'm reaching out because we suspect one of the paramedics 
involved in responding the Jeffrey Epstein call posted information online before it was reported in the 
mainstream media. 
We were able to view posts on the website 4chan, frequented by far-right trolls, that were published a full 
minutes before ABC news first reported Epstein's death. I'd like to send you the posts to verify 
whether the information in them is correct and whether it could have come to your team but in addition to 
that, do you have any statement on the situation? 
Thank you,

Inmate Death at the MCC New York 
New York, NY: On Saturday, August 10, 2019, at approximately 6:30 a.m., inmate Jeffrey 
Edward Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell in the Special Housing Unit from an apparent 
suicide at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New York, New York. Life-saving 
measures were initiated immediately by responding staff. Staff requested emergency medical 
services (EMS) and life-saving efforts continued. Mr. Epstein was transported by EMS to a local 
hospital for treatment of life-threatening injuries, and subsequently pronounced dead by hospital 
staff. The FBI is investigating the incident. 
Mr. Epstein was a 66-year-old male who arrived at MCC New York on July 6, 2019 under 
pretrial status after being indicted for sex trafficking of minors and conspiracy. 
MCC New York is an Administrative security facility that currently houses 763 male offenders 
in New York, New York.

I just got off the phone with Central Office and they are recommending we conduct a suicide risk assessment with this inmate when he 
returns from court. Should he return from court and psychology is gone for the day, he is to go on PSYCHOLOGICAL OBSERVATION 
unless, of course, he reports he is suicidal. In that case, he is to go on Suicide Watch. Inmate Epstein will likely be receiving bad 
news in court today and has multiple risk factors for suicidality as identified by BOP statistics. Let's be proactive. 
"This writer consulted with Dr. 
, Central Office, regarding inmate Epstein. Inmate Epstein has various risk factors for 
suicidality including a high profile case with media attention, sex offense charges, pre-trial status, and a court proceeding today which 
could potentially be giving him bad news regarding his legal situation. As such, when inmate Epstein returns from court, R&D staff as 
well as Lieutenant's have been informed to immediately notify the psychology department. If he returns after duty hours, the 
aforementioned staff were instructed to notify the on-call psychologist and to place inmate Epstein on a watch status until psychology 
can conduct a thorough suicide risk assessment."

Good afternoon, 
Mr. Epstein Reg. 76318-054 arrived here at MCC New York on 7/6/2019 at 9:24 PM, he was placed in Special housing unit until we 
can better evaluate him and find suitable housing for him. Today he was arraigned in court and upon his arrival will be seen by 
Psychology and they will conduct a suicide risk assessment with this inmate when he returns from court. Should he return from court 
and psychology is gone for the day, he is to go on PSYCHOLOGICAL OBSERVATION unless, of course, he reports he is suicidal. In 
that case, he is to go on Suicide Watch. 
There has been a few media inquires via phone calls however no information given. Media was staged around the back side of our 
building and in front of the court house which is less then 100 yards apart from each other. 
If you should have any additional questions and or concerns please feel free to contact me. 
Thank you 
CONFIDENTIAL

Synopsis: On July 23, 2019, at 1:27 a.m., staff responded to a call for assistance in the Special 
Housing Unit (SHU). Upon arrival, the Operations Lieutenant found inmate Epstein, Jeffrey, 
Register No. 76318-054, lying on the floor in a fetal position. The Lieutenant called out to the 
inmate; however, he did not respond and she noticed red marks on his neck. The inmate was 
placed in hand restraints and escorted to the Suicide Cell and placed on Suicide Watch. While 
on watch, the inmate indicated that his cell mate had attempted to kill him and had been 
harassing him and he had informed his Attorney of this matter. 
Medical Assessment: The inmate was medically assessed at 6:30 a.m., by the Physician 
Assistant and his findings were as follows: 
He is ambulatory, oriented x 3. In no apparent distress, smiling during this clinical encounter. 
Alleges, that he does not know what happened. Cannot explain the marks on his neck. 
Responded: "I don't know". 
He does not want to talk of the events leading to the marks on his neck. 
He does not look in any distress or pain. 
Has a circular line of erythema at the base of the neck. Reaching 2/3 of the neck 
circumference, 2 inches wide, sparing the back of the neck. Has one section of this erythema 
in the front with marks of friction. 
No inflammation, no deformities, no hematomas, no lacerations, no tenderness. Patient 
moving his neck without any restriction. Denies having any pain or discomfort. Denies any 
respiratory problem. 
Has another small erythema on left knee about 2cm in diameter (mild). 
Psychologist Assessment: He was evaluated on today at 9:10 a.m., and it has been 
determined he will remain on Suicide Watch for further observation. 
Current Status: At this time, we are reviewing his case for placement in the general 
population in Unit 7 South. We are currently looking for the appropriate cell mate.

It was good to see you yesterday. Thank you for accommodating my visit will
and giving 
him extra time to review his discovery. We very much appreciate that. 
I am writin to request the preservation of all video surveillance that captures the hallway outside of 
cell on the date and time of the Epstein incident that is currently being investigated. I 
believe that the date and time is July 23 during the early morning hours. Accordingly, I would ask 
that all video surveillance from July 22 at 11 pm to July 23 at 4 am is preserved. If it is your 
understanding that the incident occurred at a different time, please let me know and preserve the 
relevant footage, including an hour before the incident and an hour afterwards. If the responding 
officers were wearing body cameras that captured the inside of the cell in the aftermath of the 
incident, I am requesting that such footage also be preserved. 
We will be officially requesting this material through the appropriate means, but please consider 
this email a formal preservation request.

was announced by the Control Center. Upon my arrival I was informed that an inmate 
had attempted suicide and proceeded to cell, Z05-124LAD. I observed inmate 
Epstein, Jeffrey #76318-054 lying in the fetal position on the floor of his cell wearing a 
t-shirt and boxers. He was breathing heavily and was snoring. I called out to inmate 
Epstein and observed him flicker his eyes and continue snoring. 
His neck was red 
with no abrasions. I observed no further injuries to his person. An attempt was made 
to get the inmate to stand on his own with negative results. The inmate was placed in 
hand restraints and staff was directed to retrieve the stretcher. As inmate Epstein was 
being placed on the stretcher by responding staff, he would open his eyes and observe 
staff. When staff made eye contact with him, he would hurriedly shut his eyes. The 
inmate was taken to HA-Unit, dressed in the suicide smock and placed on suicide 
watch. While awaiting the arrival of an inmate companion, inmate Epstein sat on the 
edge of the bed and began moving forward as if he was attempting to fall over head 
first. When I looked away, he straightened up. As I turned to look at him again, he 
attempted the same act. I laid him down on the bed and directed him to cease his 
action or he would be placed in restraints for his safety. At that moment, he stated, 
"Okay, I won't do it again," and gave the thumbs up. Because of his unpredictable 
behavior, the decision was made to have a staff member observe inmate Epstein. I 
left HA-Unit in order to make staff notifications. Moments later, I spoke with Officer 
Clarke who stated that inmate Epstein was alert and had indicated that his cellmate, 
Tartaglione, Nicholas #78514-054 had attempted to kill him and had been harassing 
him. He stated that the inmate had indicated that he'd informed his attorney of this 
matter. 
I photographed and spoke with inmate Tartaglione, Nicholas #78514-054 who stated 
that he was asleep with his headphones on when he felt something hit his legs and 
said, "Jeff, what you're doing?" He didn't answer, so he got up, turned on the light and 
saw him with a string around his neck. He stated that he then called the guards and

they ran down. Upon ft.„ner questioning, inmate Tartaglione .aated that he sleeps on 
the bottom bunk, but gave it to inmate Epstein because he's old. He stated that he 
sleeps on the floor on a mattress. He stated that when he got up, he couldn't 
remember if he sat up or stood up to check on Epstein. He stated that Epstein was 
sitting on the floor leaning to the side with his eyes opened, but wasn't responding. He 
stated that the last time he saw him he was snoring really loud. 
Inmate Epstein stated that he came in from a legal visit at approx. 8:00PM and staff 
handed him a copy of the Daily News. "Nick" was on the floor reading the Daily News. 
He stated that he had given it to him. He stated that Tartaglione mentioned that he'd 
been in court all day in Westchester and was carrying on. At that point, inmate 
Tartaglione paused as if he was making the story up as he went along, and stated that 
Tartaglione stated, "These fucking niggers. This place is inhumane, I wish I could 
report it. (Officer), that nigger hobbit mother fucker." He then turned to a page in 
the Daily News that had his picture on it and stated that Epstein was worth seventy 
seven million dollars. Epstein stated that he took his picture, balled it up and threw it in 
the garbage. I asked inmate Epstein what happened prior to staffs arrival. He stated 
that at approx. 1:00 AM, he'd gotten up to get a drink of water, as he gets up every 
thirty minutes. He remember walking back to his bunk and waking up with staff there 
in his cell. I asked if he'd waken up and seen staff, why didn't he respond when we 
were calling out to him? He stated that he only remembered hearing himself making a 
noise like snoring. When asked about the allegations against his cellmate, he stated 
that he was told, if he hurt him, staff wouldn't care. 
Duty medical,  
was notified and briefed. It was determined no further 
medical attention was needed. A medical assessment was not conducted at the time 
of this incident, due to the fact, there was no medical staff available after 10:00 PM. 
Upon the arrival of medical staff, inmate Epstein was examined and treated by, 
for a circular line of erythema at the base of the neck, one section on the ront 
with marks of friction and a small erythema on his left knee.

he sat up on the bed and began telling me that he think his Bunkie, Tartaglione, Nicholas 
#78514-054 tried to kill him. Inmate Epstein also stated that his Bunkie also tried to extort 
money from him and stated that if he didn't pay him that he would beat him up. He stated that 
this has been going on for a week. I asked inmate Epstein if he told staff about this and he told 
me no, that he'd only told his lawyer. He went on to say that his Bunkie told him that if he beat 
him up, because of his charges, the officers would not report it and because of this he was not 
comfortable telling the officers about the prolong threats and alleged attempts to extort him. I 
immediately reported this to the lieutenant.

Inmate Epstein seems psychologically stable. 
He complained that his right arm was numb and hanging earlier. Nurse 
saw him. 
He again said his right arm still feels somewhat numb and he said he cannot make a fist with that hand. He also said he has nu 
mbness on his neck. I informed Nurse 
He stated the toilet in his cell was running for 45 minutes last night and he could not take the noise. He is going to try the toil

I can help you. 
I am now throwing you a lifesaver. You can donate to my university, the historically 
black college, Morgan State University. Our accepting your $5 million will show the world 
you are not a pariah and may help you avoid a conviction like Bill Cosby. The donation 
can be for "The Jeffrey Epstein Chair for the Promotion of Women in Mathematics," which 
will show the world your support for women. 
Alternatively, Mark Zuckerberg gave $3 million "Breakthrough Awards" to two math 
professors. You can give me a similar award. Lord Robert May of Oxford, former 
President of the Royal Society, wrote to me in 2007, "I thought your analysis of the 
bee epidemic was nice, and could well be useful." In 2018,1 solved a problem of Polya 
Prize-winner Anders BjOrner which he posed in 1981 (he implied it was a "challenging 
question" in 1976) about matchings in infinite geometric lattices. 
I am willing to publically stand with you, and your gift could generate support for you 
in the black community: public support is something you sorely need right now. 
If you want to donate to a more prestigious university, the danger is that they will 
reject your gift, but Lincoln College, part of my alma mater Oxford University, needs £1.5 
million for a lectureship in Pure Mathematics. They've raised less than £10,000! 
https://www.givecampus.com/schools/LincolnCollegehnathematics-fellowship 
I spoke with the head of the college and the head of development. The latter said that 
accepting money from you would be "a tough one for a UK institution," but if you funded me 
as an individual and pointed out to them that I could then take up the lectureship for free, they 
might be open to that. The benefit to you is that I would then be an Oxford University lecturer

Reason for Referral and Identifying Information
Inmate Epstein was referred by Unit Manager 
for an evaluation of competency to proceed with the disciplinary 
process for actions resulting in an incident report. On 7/23119, inmate Epstein was charged with code 228 (Tattooing or 
Self-Mutilation). These infractions were assigned incident report number 3282555. 
Background Information 
According to a Suicide Risk Assessment dated 7/09119 by 
"Inmate Epstein denied any history of mental 
health treatment, either on an inpatient or outpatient basis. Inmate Epstein denied any treatment in the past or present 
with psychotropic medication. He also denied any acute mental health symptoms at this time." 
According to a Suicide Risk Assessment dated 7/09/19 by 
"Inmate Epstein denied any past or present 
suicidal ideation, intention or plan. He denied ever engaging in any suicide attempts or self-injurious behavior in the 
past." 
According to this writer's Suicide Risk Assessment dated 7/23/19, "It is unclear at this time if he had placed the string 
around his neck or if someone else did." 
Clinical Interview and Mental Status Exam 
Inmate Epstein still does not remember how he obtained the marks around his neck. 
Current Mental Status: He exhibited a neutral mood with a full range of affect. His speech was logical and coherent, with 
no loosening of associations or tangential, circumstantial or irrelevant speech. Auditory and visual hallucinations were 
denied, and delusions were not elicited. He did not engage in any bizarre or inappropriate behavior. There was no 
indication of disturbed thought process or content. Intellectual ability appeared to be above average. Personal hygiene 
was adequate. He denied current suicidal or self harm ideation and he agreed to immediately tell staff if he starts to 
have suicidal or self harm thoughts. He was future oriented. He does not appear to be an immediate danger to self. He 
denied thoughts of hurting others and he agreed to tell staff if he has these thoughts. 
Clinical Imoresslon 
According to his last Diagnostic and Care Level Formulation Note dated 7/09/19 by 
"No Diagnosis, No Dx -
Current"

The determination of whether an inmate is competent to proceed with the disciplinary process is based on a clinical 
assessment of the inmate's (1) ability to understand the nature of the proceedings, and (2) their ability to assist in their 
own defense. Depending on the outcome of the assessment, one of three findings can be made: (1) the inmate is 
COMPETENT to proceed with the disciplinary process; (2) the inmate is NOT PRESENTLY COMPETENT but could be 
restored to competence with treatment; or (3) the inmate is NOT COMPETENT and is unlikely to become competent. 
Recommendations Regarding Sanctinrn

pertaining to the offense conduct, it is determined that this inmate Is: 
(X) COMPETENT to proceed with the disciplinary process. 
( ) NOT PRESENTLY COMPETENT, but could become competent with treatment; it is recommended that the inmate for 
an updated competency assessment in 30 days.

Possible Suicide Attempt 
On July 23, 2019 at approx. 1:27 a.m., a call for assistance on the Special Housing Unit 
was announced by the Control Center. Upon my arrival I was informed that an inmate 
had attempted suicide and proceeded to cell, Z05-124LAD. I observed inmate 
Epstein, Jeffrey #76318-054 lying in the fetal position on the floor of his cell wearing a 
t-shirt and boxers. He was breathing heavily and was snoring. I called out to inmate 
Epstein and observed him flicker his eyes and continue snoring. 
His neck was red 
with no abrasions. I observed no further injuries to his person. An attempt was made 
to get the inmate to stand on his own with negative results. The inmate was placed in 
hand restraints and staff was directed to retrieve the stretcher. As inmate Epstein was 
being placed on the stretcher by responding staff, he would open his eyes and observe 
staff. When staff made eye contact with him, he would hurriedly shut his eyes. The 
inmate was taken to HA-Unit, dressed in the suicide smock and placed on suicide 
watch. While awaiting the arrival of an inmate companion, inmate Epstein sat on the 
edge of the bed and began moving forward as if he was attempting to fall over head 
first. When I looked away, he straightened up. As I turned to look at him again, he 
attempted the same act. I laid him down on the bed and directed him to cease his 
action or he would be placed in restraints for his safety. At that moment, he stated, 
"Okay, I won't do it again," and gave the thumbs up. Because of his unpredictable 
behavior, the decision was made to have a staff member observe inmate Epstein. I 
left HA-Unit in order to make staff notifications. Moments later, I spoke with Officer 
who stated that inmate E 
tein was alert and had indicated that his cellmate, 
had attempted to kill him and had been harassing 
him. He stated that the inmate had indicated that he'd informed his attorney of this 
matter. 
I photographed and spoke with inmate 
who stated 
that he was asleep with his headphones on when he felt something hit his legs and 
said, "Jeff, what you're doing?" He didn't answer, so he got up, turned on the light and 
saw him with a string around his neck. He stated that he then called the guards and

they ran down.• Upon further questioning, inmate 
stated that he sleeps on 
the bottom bunk, but gave it to inmate Epstein because he's old. He stated that he 
sleeps on the floor on a mattress. He stated that when he got up, he couldn't 
remember if he sat up or stood up to check on Epstein. He stated that Epstein was 
sitting on the floor leaning to the side with his eyes opened, but wasn't responding. He 
stated that the last time he saw him he was snoring really loud. 
Inmate Epstein stated that he came in from 
legal visit at approx. 8:00PM and staff 
handed him a copy of the Daily News. "M" was on the floor reading the Daily News. 
He stated that he had given it to him. He stated that 
mentioned that he'd 
it all day in Westchester and was carrying on. At that point, inmate 
paused as if he was making the story up as he went along, and stated that 
ese fucking niggers. This place is inhumane, I wish I could 
report it. 
), that nigger hobbit mother fucker." He then turned to a page in 
the Daily News that had his picture on it and stated that Epstein was worth seventy 
seven million dollars. Epstein stated that he took his picture, balled it up and threw it in 
the garbage. I asked inmate Epstein what happened prior to staffs arrival. He stated 
that at approx. 1:00 AM, he'd gotten up to get a drink of water, as he gets up every 
thirty minutes. He remember walking back to his bunk and waking up with staff there 
in his cell. I asked if he'd waken up and seen staff, why didn't he respond when we 
were calling out to him? He stated that he only remembered hearing himself making a 
noise like snoring. When asked about the allegations against his cellmate, he stated 
that he was told, if he hurt him, staff wouldn't care. 
Duty medical, 
was notified and briefed. It was determined no further 
medical attention was needed. A medical assessment was not conducted at the time 
of this incident, due to the fact, there was no medical staff available after 10:00 PM. 
S
e arrival of medical staff, inmate Epstein was examined and treated by, 
for a circular line of erythema at the base of the neck, one section on the front 
with marks of friction and a small erythema on his left knee.

Possible Suicide Attempt 
On July 23, 2019 at approx. 1:27 a.m., a call for assistance on the Special Housing Unit 
was announced by the Control Center. Upon my arrival I was informed that an inmate 
had attempted suicide and proceeded to cell, Z05-124LAD. I observed inmate 
Epstein, Jeffrey #76318-054 lying in the fetal position on the floor of his cell wearing a 
t-shirt and boxers. He was breathing heavily and was snoring. I called out to inmate 
Epstein and observed him flicker his eyes and continue snoring. 
His neck was red 
with no abrasions. I observed no further injuries to his person. An attempt was made 
to get the inmate to stand on his own with negative results. The inmate was placed in 
hand restraints and staff was directed to retrieve the stretcher. As inmate Epstein was 
being placed on the stretcher by responding staff, he would open his eyes and observe 
staff. When staff made eye contact with him, he would hurriedly shut his eyes. The 
inmate was taken to HA-Unit, dressed in the suicide smock and placed on suicide 
watch. While awaiting the arrival of an inmate companion, inmate Epstein sat on the 
edge of the bed and began moving forward as if he was attempting to fall over head 
first. When I looked away, he straightened up. As I turned to look at him again, he 
attempted the same act. I laid him down on the bed and directed him to cease his 
action or he would be placed in restraints for his safety. At that moment, he stated, 
"Okay, I won't do it again," and gave the thumbs up. Because of his unpredictable 
behavior, the decision was made to have a staff member observe inmate Epstein. I 
left HA-Unit in order to make staff notifications. Moments later, I spoke with Officer 
Clark- wh sta 
tein was alert and had indicated that his cellmate, 
had attempted to kill him and had been harassing 
im 
e state 
e inmate had indicated that he'd informed his attorney of this 
matter. 
I photographed and spoke with inmate 
who stated 
that he was asleep with his headphones on when he felt something hit his legs and 
said, "Jeff, what you're doing?" He didn't answer, so he got up, turned on the light and 
saw him with a string around his neck. He stated that he then called the guards and

they ran down. Upon f,....ner questioning, inmate 
..fated that he sleeps on 
the bottom bunk, but gave it to inmate Epstein because he's old. He stated that he 
sleeps on the floor on a mattress. He stated that when he got up, he couldn't 
remember if he sat up or stood up to check on Epstein. He stated that Epstein was 
sitting on the floor leaning to the side with his eyes opened, but wasn't responding. He 
stated that the last time he saw him he was snoring really loud. 
Inmate Epstein stated that he came in fricau legal visit at approx. 8:00PM and staff 
handed him a copy of the Daily News. "M" was on the floor reading the Daily News. 
He stated that he had given it to him. He stated that 
mentioned that he'd 
been in court all day in Westchester and was carrying on. At that point, inmate 
paused as if he was making the story up as he went along, and stated that 
stated, "These fucking niggers. This place is inhumane, I wish I could 
report it. 
(Officer), that nigger hobbit mother fucker." He then turned to a page in 
the Daily News that had his picture on it and stated that Epstein was worth seventy 
seven million dollars. Epstein stated that he took his picture, balled it up and threw it in 
the garbage. I asked inmate Epstein what happened prior to staffs arrival. He stated 
that at approx. 1:00 AM, he'd gotten up to get a drink of water, as he gets up every 
thirty minutes. He remember walking back to his bunk and waking up with staff there 
in his cell. I asked if he'd waken up and seen staff, why didn't he respond when we 
were calling out to him? He stated that he only remembered hearing himself making a 
noise like snoring. When asked about the allegations against his cellmate, he stated 
that he was told, if he hurt him, staff wouldn't care. 
Duty medical,  
was notified and briefed. It was determined no further 
medical attention was needed. A medical assessment was not conducted at the time 
of this incident, due to the fact, there was no medical staff available after 10:00 PM. 
iU on the arrival of medical staff, inmate Epstein was examined and treated by, MLP I 
for a circular line of erythema at the base of the neck, one section on the front 
wit marks of friction and a small erythema on his left knee.

tried to kill him. Inmate Epstein also stated that his Bunkie also tried to extort 
money from him and stated that if he didn't pay him that he would beat him up. He stated that 
this has been going on for a week. I asked inmate Epstein if he told staff about this and he told

TEXT htm 
Good afternoon all, 
Below please find complaints from Epstein's attorneys. Can you check to see if he has toilet paper and 
that his CPAP is plugged in? 
I am less concerned regarding his complaint of having had two calls, but they were on unmonitored lines, 
so there is no recording of them. Is his phone account set up so he can get a call on the ITS when 30 
days has elapsed? 
Thank you,

Good afternoon Mr. 
Our client, Jeffrey Epstein, has informed us that he has no toilet paper in his cell. His CPap machine was 
not plugged in last night, so he was unable to use it. 
Also, since his arrival at MCC, he has only been able to make two fifteen minute phone calls. Both times, 
the calls were on speaker phone, with officers present. 
Thank you in advance for your help.

(1) Has Epstein's next of kin been notified? 
(2) Did staff initiate life-saving measures when they first found Epstein at approximately 6:30 am in his 
cell? 
(3) Did EMS or some sort of hospital staff come out to the institution, and if so, did they initiate life-
saving measures at the institution? And did EMS drive Epstein to the hospital or did BOP drive him to 
the hospital? 
(4) Was Epstein pronounced dead by EMS (transporting folks) or instead hospital staff at 7:30 am at the 
hospital? 
(5) Was the FBI notified? Is it being investigated as a suicide? 
(6) What date did he first arrive at MCC NY on his PP37? 
(7) What are his specific offense titles for which he is indicted? I believe generally the news calls it sex 
trafficking, but we should be as specifically accurate based on Sentry (or the court order if we have it).

Dear Mr. Epstein: 
I am writing to express my condolences to you regarding the death of your brother, Jeffrey 
Edward Epstein, who passed away Saturday, August 10, 2019. 
On August 10, 2019, Jeffrey Edward Epstein was pronounced dead at the New York 
Presbyterian-Lower Manhattan Hospital in New York, New York. At this time, although 
there are no preliminary reports identifying the exact cause of death, it appears to be the result 
of suicide. 
Although I realize that words alone cannot lessen your sorrow, I hope that my thoughts and 
sincerest sympathy will be of some comfort to you. 
Sincerely, 
Warden 
MCC New York

United States v. Jeffrey 
Epstein, 19-cr-00490-
RN! B 
I am writing to notify the Court of the death of Jeffrey Epstein, who passed away Saturday, 
August 10, 2019, at around 7:37 a.m. 
Mr. Epstein had been found unresponsive in his cell in the Special Housing Unit at around 
6:30 am from an apparent suicide at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New 
York, New York. Responding staff immediately initiated life-saving measures and requested 
emergency medical services (EMS), by whom Mr. Epstein was transported to a local hospital 
for treatment of life-threatening injuries. Mr. Epstein was pronounced dead at the New York 
Presbyterian-Lower Manhattan Hospital in New York, New York. 
At this time, there are no preliminary reports identifying the exact cause of death. An autopsy 
is pending, and we expect to have more information as to the cause of death from the medical 
examiner in the near future. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is actively investigating the 
incident.

the official cause of death is determined. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel 
free to call me at

The email below is from one of two staff here that has been targeted by the New York Times soliciting information on Epstein via their 
personal email. I will monitor this closely and I have already put out an email to all staff on the media and who are the only approved 
staff that are allowed to speak to them. In addition the Warden held a recall today expressing the concerns if staff are sharing 
information and how it is prohibited. Please let me know your thoughts. 
New York Times must be getting staff email addresses through social media outlets.

Hi 
I hope this finds you well. My name is Christina Goldbaum and I'm a reporter with The New York Times. I'm sony to reach out out of the 
blue, but at NYT we are working on a story about MCC and what happened to Jeffrey Epstein. Were trying to learn a little more about the 
prison and how it works internally (I hear there have been some issues with staffing, overtime etc), and I was wondering if you might be 
free for a quick chat on background (meaning that I will not use your name in any article, or anything that could identify you). I'd just like to 
leam a bit more about the prison itself -- there are a lot of rumors flying around, as you know, and we'd lik 
speak in concrete 
terms about the prison from people who know it best. Please let me know if you're free or give me a ring: 
Thanks, 
Christina

I visited inmate Epstein in SHU on Thursday. He was getting ready to meet with his attorneys for the day 
so I had gone to visit him right after the SHU meeting. He had a cell mate at the time with whom I saw 
him interact with. He did not report any mental health concems and he denied any suicidal thoughts or 
intention. He was asking this writer to go to general population and was making requests for various 
needs he had at the time. He wanted social calls without them being on a speaker phone. He wanted a 
book he had left in the suicide watch area. His mood was not depressed or anxious. There were no signs 
of distress. He had planned on meeting with his attomeys to work on his legal situation.

FROM:

UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT 
FEDERAL BUREAU OF PRISONS 
Metropolitan Correctional Center 
New York, NY. 10007 
SUBJECT: 
Security Expectations Involving Inmate 
Epstein, Jeffrey Reg. No. 76318-054 
During the week of July 31, 2019 in order to address management 
concerns with inmate Epstein. I felt it was necessary to hold informal 
training sessions with Correctional Services Supervisors and Line 
Staff assigned to the Special Housing Unit. The informal training 
sessions was conducted in the Lieutenants Office, inside the SHU, 
and while conducting rounds throughout the institution. I informed 
staff of the importance of being vigilant and being security minded 
when dealing with inmate Epstein, Jeffrey Reg. No. 76318-054, and 
other inmates within the Special Housing Unit. I explained that 
Lieutenants were to conduct more un announced rounds in the unit, 
providing oversite over operations and security. I pointed out 
apparent security concerns such as observation windows being blocked 
preventing staff from completing proper rounds, torn bed sheets, 
clothing, covering of light fixtures, clotheslines, and the 
accumulation of food trays in cells. I made clear of my expectations 
of maintaining a clean and manageable unit. I explained should we 
not continue to be proactive in the management of our inmate 
population, there would be another occurrence of the below describe 
incident. 
Inmate Epstein while housed at the Metropolitan Correctional Center 
located in New York City. In the early morning hours of July 23, 
2019, he was found unresponsive in his cell after an apparent suicide 
attempt. 
In detailed conversations with the SHU Lieutenant, he was informed 
of my expectations regarding the supervision of inmate Epstein. 
Specifically, he was reminded on several occasions that inmate 
Epstein was to housed with a cell mate.

Warden, 
Per our conversation, I spoke to two of his attorneys yesterday, August 9, 2019, primarily in relation to his request for access to water 
in attorney conference. Attorney 
, with whom I spoke in person in the late morning, had asked as an aside whether we 
would consider housing him in the Cadre. I advised we could not since he was a pretrial inmate. Later that day but prior to the 1:00 
close-out meeting, I spoke to Attorney 
on the phone. He had asked whether we could house Mr. Epstein alone in SHU, 
to which I replied that we could not based on his prior suicide attempt/gesture. He acknowledged that he understood. To my 
recollection, neither attorney referenced consideration for suicide watch or psychological observation during yesterday's 
conversations. 
Please let me know if you need any further information. 
Thank you, 
I

Hello, 
I'm a reporter with BuzzFeed News. I'm reaching out because we suspect one of the paramedics involved in responding the Jeffrey 
Epstein call posted information online before it was reported in the mainstream media. 
We were able to view posts on the website 4chan, frequented by far-right trolls, that were published a full 45 minutes before ABC news 
first reported Epstein's death. I'd like to send you the posts to verify whether the information in them is correct and whether it could 
have come to your team but in addition to that, do you have any statement on the situation? 
Thank you, 
Jane

Warden 
ou for supporting our scheduling of the Psychological Reconstruction for inmate Epstein. I will be joined by 
Thank
, Correctional Services Administrator, Northeast Region. 
I am attaching a list of materials we will use to complete the reconstruction. We routinely take these documents with us so 
please ensure you have a copy of any documents you also need. Your assistance in gathering these documents is appreciated and 
will be helpful. 
Organizing and facilitating staff interviews often takes the most time and I am requesting the assistance of an assigned staff member. 
In the past, wardens commonly have someone from the SIS department or a lieutenant available throughout the reconstruction for this 
purpose and to track down additional documents as needed. 
As discussed we will be staying at the Sheraton Tribeca on 370 Canal Street and appreciate your arranging travel to the institution. 
We will be ready for pickup at 0715 on Tuesday morning and expect to complete the reconstruction by close of business on Thursday. 
Please feel free to contact me with any questions. 
Thanks,

Mr. 
Mr. Epstein's family has asked me to send to you and 
at the MCC a request for the preservation of 
any and all documents, records, reports, videos, pictures, physical evidence, electronic communication data, tape recordings, logs, 
notes, papers, emails and any and all other forms of information that would be in the possession of the MCC, its Warden, their

agency that relate to Jeffrey Epstein's imprisonment/detention since July 6, 2019 and that relate particularly but not exclusively to 
the July 23, 2019 occurrence which was investigated as an attempted suicide by the MCC and the events relating to his death on 
August 10, 2019. The request encompasses but is not limited to any videos of the 9th floor area in the proximity of his cell during 
the evening of August 9 through the time Mr. Epstein was taken out of his cell for the last time on August 10, 2019, or videos of 
the cell itself during that time period, records of the identities of (i.e. MCC employees or independent contractors or anyone else) 
who were on duty from midnight through 8 AM on August 10, 2019 or otherwise had access to the 9th floor unit where Mr. 
Epstein was incarcerated during this time period, records of any observations of Mr. Epstein on August 9-10, 2019, any and all 
photographs of Mr. Epstein or his cell taken on August 10, 2019, any and all electronic or tape recordings or records of any

him on or take Mr Epstein off suicide watch, photos of his cell taken on or before August 9 or on or after August 10, 2019, 
memoranda of interviews with any prisoners who were in Mr. Epstein's SHU unit on the 9th floor on or about July 23 or on August 
9-10, 2019 relating to Mr. Epstein, the same request for interview memoranda of any MCC employee or independent contractor 
or any other person in the MCC midnight-8 AM August 10, 2019, any and all medical and EMS and hospital records from July 23 
and/or August 10, 2019, and the future pathology and toxicology and medical examiner's reports. Additionally, we would request 
the preservation of any note or notes found in Mr. Epstein's cell on August 10, 2019, any ligature or other physical evidence 
related to his cause of death, any bedding, any medication or vitamins, any log showing who entered or were present in the MCC 
for the 12 hour period before 6:30 AM on August 10, 2019, as well as a list of inmates who were in Mr. Epstein's unit during the 
evening of August 9 and the morning of August 10, 2019. We would in addition to the preservation request ask for the production 
of all of the above. We would receive and retain in subject any information received in response to this request subject to the 
terms and conditions of our Protective Order. In short, the family requests a preservation and production of any and all records

I did not have the Staff SW Log when I interviewed him today. I found the log in 
mailbox and when I reviewed them it noted 
that he told staff watching him that his cellmate tried to kill him and that he was trying to remember what happened. I was not able to 
ask him about this because he was in legal all afternoon and is still there now.

totally. i wonder if, was mbarr s d/introspective seeing 
response like that. this is b/c of epstein. he was on SW but in regular 
clothes on legal visit and 
questioned it. i told 
when she asked that we have done it this way in the past. in light of the 
huge scar on epstein's neck (granted a ton of ambiguity surrounding the incident), he did need to be on SW yesterday. i guess we 
should have declined his legal visit if we were following this other chiefs advice 
>» 
7/24/2019 8:40 AM >>> 
lol i love this guy's response. that if this is even a question, they probably shouldn't even be on watch. we put way too many people on 
there. I'm even seeing the difference in BRO. they just don't function that way. guys come here from MCC and go to SHU, and tell staff 
they want to go on SW, and the staff laugh at them, and the inmates tell them they were able to get on watch that way at MCC. and 
the psych who responded to her is at Chicago, another detention center. so, I'm guessing they see a lot of the same things that we do, 
and probably use SW less as an option.

If you have e-mailed to refer an inmate whom you believe may be at risk for self harm, this e-mail is not 
sufficient. Please maintain constant visual observation of the inmate or arrange, via the Operations 
Lieutenant, to initiate a Suicide Watch pending a formal Suicide Risk Assessment by a Psychologist. 
Please also make immediate verbal contact with a Psychologist. If it is after hours, please notify the 
Operations Lieutenant so that the on-call Psychologist can be contacted.

the floor in a fetal position. The Lieutenant called out to the inmate; 
however, he did not respond and she noticed red marks on his neck. The 
inmate was placed in hand restraints and escorted to the Suicide Cell and

by the Physician Assistant and his findings were as follows: 
He is ambulatory, oriented x 3. In no apparent distress, smiling during this

Below is the definition of Psychological Observation provided by Dr. M, 
Chief Psychologist. He 
will remain on Psychological Observation until tomorrow, where he will be reassessed. 
DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a serious personality 
disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to 
deteriorate. The inmate is no longer mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general 
population or the Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates placed 
on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm or engaged in self-harming 
behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, 
disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her behavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status 
is intended as a temporary designation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able 
to function independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or transferred to an 
inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center. 
He has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation and therefore he will return to the S 
ial 
Housing Unit (SHU) and will be celled with inmate

Hello,

Epstein is pending a Code 228, Tattooing or Self-Mutilation and I spoke with Dr. 
who indicated that most likely he will be found 
competent because he is not mentally ill. We have supporting memorandums from the responding officers who indicated they 
observed inmate Epstein with a makeshift noose around his neck. Therefore, he will be
 a UDC hearing. Should he return to 
SHU, he will be housed with inmate 
. Inmate III is a 54-year-old White Male. He is a 
Pretrial inmate on a Supervised Release Violation for Failure to Register as Sex Offender. He is refusing to go to general 
population. 
The other inmates in SHU were reviewed for a possible cell mate, however inmate 
and 
were determined the appropriate candidates as cell mates. However, 
releases on July 26, 2019. He is also the current cell 
mate of inmate 
We are still reviewing cases in the general population for a possible cell mate. 
If I haven't addressed your questions, please call me and let me know. Thanks.

Below is the definition of Psychological Observation provided by Dr. MI, Chief Psychologist. He 
will remain on Psychological Observation until tomorrow, where he will be reassessed. 
DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a serious personality 
disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to 
deteriorate. The inmate is no longer mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general 
population or the Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates placed 
on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm or engaged in self-harming 
behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, 
disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her behavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status 
is intended as a temporary designation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able 
to function independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or transferred to an 
inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center. 
He has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation and therefore he will return to the S 
ial 
Housing Unit (SHU) and will be celled with inmate

Hello =, 
It was good to see you yesterday. Thank you for accommodating my visit with Tartaglione and giving 
him extra time to review his discovery. We very much appreciate that. 
I am writing to request the preservation of all video surveillance that captures the hallway outside of 
Tartaglione's cell on the date and time of the Epstein incident that is currently being investigated. I 
believe that the date and time is July 23 during the early morning hours. Accordingly, I would ask 
that all video surveillance from July 22 at 11 pm to July 23 at 4 am is preserved. If it is your 
understanding that the incident occurred at a different time, please let me know and preserve the 
relevant footage, including an hour before the incident and an hour afterwards. If the responding 
officers were wearing body cameras that captured the inside of the cell in the aftermath of the 
incident, I am requesting that such footage also be preserved. 
We will be officially requesting this material through the appropriate means, but please consider 
this email a formal preservation request.

TEXT htm 
The National Suicide Prevention Coordinator from Central Office, 
contacted me today about 
Epstein. He thought that housing him with another sex offender in SHU would be a good idea. I told him 
I would speak with the executive staff about his suggestion. Also, 
thought it wise that we keep 
him down here for a bit (as is the plan already). 
I am heading to the hospital in about a half an hour or so. If you need me for anything, feel free to call

Yes, I already went back there but he was in the shower. As soon as he is done showering and dressed, I will go back there again. I 
wanted to assess that psych obs is still ok... Central Office Psych was concerned I stepped him down to psych obs rather than keeping 
him on SW. I gave my justification and feel it is appropriate, but I just want to make sure I still feel that way when he is interviewed

Hello,

Epstein is pending a Code 228, Tattooing or Self-Mutilation and I spoke with Dr. 
who indicated that most likely he will be found 
competent because he is not mentally ill. We have supporting memorandums from the responding officers who indicated they 
observed inmate Epstein with a ma 
hit noose around his neck. Therefore, he will 
ndin a UDC hearin . Should he return to 
SHU, he will be housed with inmate 
. lnmat 
. He is a 
Pretrial inmate on a Supervised Release Violation for Failure to Register as Sex Offender. He is refusing to go to general 
population. 
The other inmates in SHU were reviewed for a possible cell mate, how 
inmate 
and 
were determine 
appropriate candidates as cell mates. However, 
releases on July 26, 2019. He is also the current cell 
determine 
mate of inmate M. 
We are still reviewing cases in the general population for a possible cell mate. 
If I haven't addressed your questions, please call me and let me know. Thanks.

Below is the definition of Psychological Observation provided by Dr. M, 
Chief Psychologist. He 
will remain on Psychological Observation until tomorrow, where he will be reassessed. 
DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a serious personality 
disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to 
deteriorate. The inmate is no longer mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general 
population or the Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates placed 
on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm or engaged in self-harming 
behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, 
disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her behavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status 
is intended as a temporary designation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able 
to function independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or transferred to an 
inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center. 
He has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation and therefore, he will return to the Special
Housing Unit (SHU) and will be celled with inmate 
. Inmate 
pleaded guilty in March to mailing improvised explosive devices to 13 people, 
including many prominent Democratic figures, among them former President Barack Obama, former 
Vice President Joe Biden, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sens. Cory Booker (NJ.) and 
Kamala D. Harris (Calif.), as well as CNN. He drove around in a van festooned with political stickers 
and rants, one of them targeting CNN. His case has been highly publicized and he is in SHU because 
h r 
tested Protcctivc Custody.

He complained about being dehydrated because he stated he cannot drink enough water because of limited bathroom breaks in Legal 
since he stated he sees his Attorney for about 12 hours. 
He also complained about having to go back up to SHU. Being anxious about it and not being able to sleep there because of the noise

Date: 
07/30/2019 12:01 
Provider:

Reg #: 
76318-054 
Unit Team: 5 
Reason for Referral and Identifying Information 
Inmate Epstein was referred by Unit Manager 
for an evaluation of competency to proceed with the disciplinary 
process for actions resulting in an incident report. On 7/23/19, inmate Epstein was charged with code 228 (Tattooing or 
Self-Mutilation). These infractions were assigned incident report number 3282555. 
Background Information 
According to a Suicide Risk Assessment dated 7/09/19 by Dr. 
"Inmate Epstein denied any history of mental 
health treatment, either on an inpatient or outpatient basis. Inmate Epstein denied any treatment in the past or present 
with psychotropic medication. He also denied any acute mental health symptoms at this time." 
According to a Suicide Risk Assessment dated 7/09/19 by Dr. 
"Inmate Epstein denied any past or present 
suicidal ideation, intention or plan. He denied ever engaging in any suicide attempts or self-injurious behavior in the 
past." 
According to this writer's Suicide Risk Assessment dated 7/23/19, 'It is unclear at this time if he had placed the string 
around his neck or if someone else did." 
Clinical Interview and Mental Status Exam 
Inmate Epstein still does not remember how he obtained the marks around his neck. 
Current Mental Status: He exhibited a neutral mood with a full range of affect. His speech was logical and coherent, with 
no loosening of associations or tangential, circumstantial or irrelevant speech. Auditory and visual hallucinations were 
denied, and delusions were not elicited. He did not engage in any bizarre or inappropriate behavior. There was no 
indication of disturbed thought process or content. Intellectual ability appeared to be above average. Personal hygiene 
was adequate. He denied current suicidal or self harm ideation and he agreed to immediately tell staff if he starts to 
have suicidal or self harm thoughts. He was future oriented. He does not appear to be an immediate danger to self. He 
denied thoughts of hurting others and he agreed to tell staff if he has these thoughts. 
Clinical Impression 
According to his last Diagnostic and Care Level Formulation Note dated 7/09/19 by Dr. 
, "No Diagnosis, No Dx -
Current" 
Findings 
The determination of whether an inmate is competent to proceed with the disciplinary process is based on a clinical 
assessment of the inmate's (1) ability to understand the nature of the proceedings, and (2) their ability to assist in their 
own defense. Depending on the outcome of the assessment, one of three findings can be made: (1) the inmate is 
COMPETENT to proceed with the disciplinary process; (2) the inmate is NOT PRESENTLY COMPETENT but could be 
restored to competence with treatment; or (3) the inmate is NOT COMPETENT and is unlikely to become competent. 
Recommendations 
ardity_Sanctions 
In the case of inmate Epstein, after a review of available psychological and psychiatric records as well as information 
pertaining to the offense conduct, it is determined that this inmate is: 
(X) COMPETENT to proceed with the disciplinary process. 
( ) NOT PRESENTLY COMPETENT, but could become competent with treatment; it is recommended that the inmate for 
an updated competency assessment in 30 days. 
( ) NOT COMPETENT and not likely to become competent.

Supplement 
OPI: 
NUMBER: 
DATE: 
SUBJECT: 
CMC 
NYM 7331.04e 
November 13, 2014 
Pretrial Inmates 
1. 
PURPOSE AND SCOPE: The primary mission of the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC), New 
York, is to confine pretrial inmates for the United States Marshals (USM) Service. Pretrial inmates are 
defined as those individuals who are legally detained, but for whom the Bureau of Prisons has not yet 
received notification of conviction. Ordinarily, pretrial inmates will be separated, to the extent possible, 
from convicted inmates. The purpose of this supplement is to establish the procedures and operations, 
as well as staff responsibilities, for the operation of the institution, as it relates to pretrial inmates. It is 
paramount this supplement is read in conjunction with the program statement as information stated in 
national policy is not reiterated within. 
H. 
DIRECTIVES AFFECTED: 
a. 
Directives Rescinded: I.S. 7331.04d, Pretrial Inmates, dated June 25, 2009. 
b. 
Directives Referenced: P.S. 7331.04, Pretrial Inmates, dated January 31, 2003. 
III. 
PROCEDURES: MCC New York provides the care, custody. and control of inmates for the USM 
Service, while they are in pretrial status. However, all pretrial inmates remain the responsibility of the 
U.S. Marshal Service until they arc convicted by the Court. In addition to pretrial inmates, MCC New 
York also confines sentenced inmates and holdovers. Additionally, MCC New York houses inmates on 
writs to the local district courts who have already been sentenced in other federal or state courts. 
Although pretrial inmates are ideally separated from convicted inmates, it is not always possible or 
practical to keep all pretrial inmates separate from those who have been convicted. Due to the unique 
design, structure, and operation of MCC New York, staff may. based upon sound correctional judgment, 
permit pretrial inmates, who do not present a risk to the security or orderly running of the institution, to 
have regular contact with convicted inmates. Therefore, pretrial inmates at this facility may be housed 
with convicted inmates, provided a waiver is signed. However, it is essential that pretrial inmates be 
separated from sentenced inmates before and during the intake screening process.

A. 
Procedures for Admission: The following procedures shall be followed when processing all 
new commitments, to include the verification of commitment papers, and searches of inmates 
and property. 
1. 
Inmates entering the Receiving and Discharge (R&D) area will be identified by 
Correctional Systems (CS)staff, formerly Inmate Systems Management (ISM) staff via an 
interview with the remanding official and the inmate. CS staff will review the Prisoner 
Remand (BP377) for accurate and complete information. All legal documents delivered 
with the inmate will be verified. 
2. 
All inmates will walk through a metal-weapon detector, be pat searched, and visually 
searched; a hand-held metal detector may also be used. All inmate property will be 
searched. 
3. 
Prior to being escorted to their assigned housing units, all new commitments will receive 
two jumpsuits, two pair of socks, two pair of underwear, one ditty bag {a toothbrush, 
toothpaste, a comb, and shaving cream), one pair of tennis deck shoes, and one institution 
bedroll {two blankets, two sheets, one pillow case, one towel, and one washcloth). 
Female pretrial inmates receive two pair of pants and shirts, versus jumpsuits, and two 
bras. 
B. 
Intake Screening (Social Interview): Due to the lack of available information concerning 
pretrial inmates, it is imperative a thorough intake screening is completed on all new 
commitments. Unit team staff will conduct intake screening on all inmates committed to the 
institution between the hours of 7:30 a.m. and 9:00 p.m. Monday thru Friday. If members of the 
Unit Team are not available, a Lieutenant will conduct the intake screening. All staff members 
conducting intake screening must be CIM certified. 
1. 
Staff conducting intake screening for new commitments will receive a SENTRY generated 
Intake Screening form (BP-64) from R&D staff once the inmate has been loaded into 
SENTRY. Staff must pay special attention to the CMC Clearance and Separatee Data 
printout attached to the Intake Screening form. If SENTRY is not operational, staff should 
utilize the manual Intake Screening form (BP-312) {Attachment A). If possible, the staff 
member conducting the intake screening should obtain pertinent information from the 
Deputy U. S. Marshal, or arresting agent, committing the inmate. Staff conducting the 
intake screening must review the U.S. Marshals Remand to Custody form to determine the 
offense with which the inmate is being charged. The interviewer should notate if the 
inmate is charged with a sophisticated crime, such as, Racketeering or Engaging in a 
Continuing Criminal Enterprise, or a violent offense such as, Murder, Bank Robbery, or

Extortion. The staff member conducting the interview will document any security 
concerns on the Intake Screening form. Staff will also assess the inmate's physical and 
mental condition, and document his/her conclusions on the Intake Screening form. If a 
psychological condition is noted, screening staff must notify the Duty Psychologist 
immediately of any noted mental concerns inmate. If on a weekend, the screening staff 
must call the on call Duty Psychologist to interview the inmate. If available, the staff 
member conducting the screening must review the Pre-Sentence Report and the Central 
File. The staff member's review of this material shall be documented on the Intake 
Screening form. Finally, the staff member conducting the interview will determine if the 
inmate can be placed in the general population of this institution. If the inmate's placement 
in general population would pose a threat to the security or orderly running of the 
institution, the Operations Lieutenant should be notified in order for the inmate to be placed 
in Administrative Detention. The conclusion that the inmate warrants placement in 
Administrative Detention should be documented directly on the Intake Screening form. 
This form must be signed by the staff member conducting the intake screening. When 
intake screening court returns, the supplement on Intake Screening must be reviewed. A 
separate questionnaire will be completed which addresses all questions on the SENTRY 
generated form. All intake screening must occur in the privacy of a room with only the 
inmate being intake screened and staff. If a notorious pretrial inmate, an inmate whose 
presence could attract undue attention to the Bureau of Prisons, or an inmate who requires a 
higher degree of security based on a serious volatile background or violent crime is 
committed, the intake screener will make copies of (Inmate Alert Notice) for the 
Supervisory Correctional Systems Specialist (SCSS), CMC, SIS Office, the Lieutenant's 
Office and the Captain. The Captain will then notify the Warden and Executive staff 
2. 
The staff member conducting the intake screening will ensure the intake screening form is 
Filled out completely and correctly, to include all times and dates. The staff member 
conducting the intake screening must also ensure the following forms are completed: 
a. 
Pretrial Inmate Notice of Separation/Work Waiver, BP-S203.073: Staff will 
ensure Section II of this form is completed for each new pretrial inmate. If a 
pretrial inmate refuses to sign this form, staff will document this fact and any 
reasons the inmate provides for refusing to sign on the form. Each new pretrial 
inmate should also be asked to complete Section IV of this form, the work waiver 
section. If a pretrial inmate does not wish to volunteer for a work assignment, 
this fact should also be documented on the form. 
If an inmate's ability to comprehend this waiver appears questionable, a referral to 
Psychology Services will be made for determination of competency.

b. 
Pretrial Inmate Interview, BP-S562.073: This form must be completed in 
conjunction with the Intake Screening Form. It is essential a thorough review of 
the inmate's status be completed upon his/her commitment. This form must be 
completed and signed by the staff member conducting the intake screening 
interview. 
c. 
Acknowledgment of Inmates (BP407 and 408): Staff must either have each 
inmate read or read to each inmate the policies/procedures on these forms; staff 
must cross off the method of advisement not used. Staff must ensure these forms 
are completed in their entirety. 
3. 
The intake screener is also responsible for distributing the "Inmate Rights and 
Responsibilities" to all new commitments. The intake screener will ensure each inmate 
acknowledges his/her receipt of the rights and responsibilities by circling the appropriate 
response on the Intake Screening form and signing it. If an inmate refuses to sign the 
BP-64 to acknowledge receipt of the rights and responsibilities, staff shall document this 
fact on the form. The completed BP-64 shall be filed in the inmate's unit management 
file, hereinafter called the drop file. 
4. 
CS staff are responsible for reviewing the U.S. Marshals receipt to review the status of 
those inmates returning from court each day. If an inmate's pretrial status changes, ISM 
staff will make the necessary changes in SENTRY. ISM staff is also responsible for 
interviewing the escorting Deputy U.S. Marshal to determine if any unusual 
circumstances occurred in court which could affect an inmate's classification at this 
institution. 
5. 
All new commitments will be issued the pamphlet entitled "Sexual Abuse/Assault 
Prevention and Intervention." 
C. 
Medical Intake Screening and Procedures: 
1. 
All new commitments are examined by a physician's assistant. The physician's assistant 
will screen all inmates in accordance with BOP medical procedures to determine if there 
are any reasons for not placing the inmate in general population, or for restricting work 
assignments. Specific attention shall be given to evidence of depression and potential 
suicide, and whether the inmates are victims of recent sexual assaults during a period of 
incarceration. A copy of the completed Intake Screening Medical form (BP-354) will be 
placed in the inmate's file maintained in Correctional Systems. All pretrial inmates will 
receive a complete medical screening within fourteen days of their arrival at this facility.

2. 
The Health Services Department will conduct sick call, triage, and physical exams for 
each housing unit Monday through Friday. Medical emergencies are handled 
immediately. 
3. 
Medical staff is on duty seven days a week, in the event of a medical emergency. Pretrial 
inmates receive the same level of basic medical care, including dental care, provided to 
sentenced inmates. The decision to defer or deny elective medical procedures shall be 
based on the same policies or guidelines which apply to sentenced inmates. The 
transient nature of pretrial inmates often precludes many elective procedures. 
Emergency medical treatment is provided in accordance with local procedures, for both 
pretrial and sentenced inmates. The Unit Manager is responsible for preparing a letter 
from the Warden to the Judge, through the U.S. Marshal, to notify the Court of any 
inmate receiving any psychiatric medication and/or any other medication that may alter 
the inmates courtroom behavior. It has been established locally that the medications 
which fall under the realm of "psychiatric medication which may affect courtroom 
behavior" are anti-psychotic, anti-manic, and on occasion, anti-depressants medications. 
The Pharmacist is responsible for providing the respective Unit Manager a list of inmates 
prescribed either anti-psychotic or anti-manic medication on a daily basis. The 
Psychiatrist will provide the Unit Manager with a list of inmates prescribed 
anti-depressants when he believes the medication "may affect courtroom behavior." 
(See Attachment B). A copy of this letter will be sent to the Assistant United States 
Attorney (AUSA), the USM, and the inmate's attorney, via the AUSA. A copy of this 
letter will also be put in the inmate's medical file and forwarded to Psychology. These 
same procedures apply to inmates committed for 4241(a) and 4242 psychological studies. 
D. 
Housing: Pretrial inmates, who are appropriate for general population, are placed in one of the 
seven general population housing units; six male units and one female unit. Five male housing 
units contain secure two-man rooms; four units have a capacity of housing 96 inmates; one unit 
has the capacity to house 94 inmates. There is one male dormitory unit which has the capacity 
of housing 156 inmates. The female unit houses 79 inmates and housing style varies from two 
to six woman rooms. 
1. Unit Assignment: Due to the unique nature and structure of this facility, the MCC has the 
capability of housing inmates who must be separated from one another. Therefore, as long 
as an inmate does not present any unusual security or medical concerns which would require 
his/her placement in Administrative Detention, pretrial inmates will be assigned housing 
units in general population using their separation needs as the primary factor. The officer 
assigned to the Counts and Assignments (C&A) Office is responsible for ensuring that 
inmates are initially placed in the appropriate housing units. This decision will be based 
upon accessing SENTRY and determining the inmate's separation needs; and also 
information provided by unit staff, ISM staff, or a Lieutenant.

MCC New York's unique design and mission require that many activities are provided on 
the units (i.e., meal serving, pill line, recreation); the units are partially self-sufficient 
requiring movement off the unit only for purposes of medical care, outdoor recreation, 
law library, some educational classes, movement to court, and attorney meetings. 
2. 
Procedures: Unit Managers are responsible for the operations within their housing units, 
to include sanitation, clothing, property, feeding, recreation, etc. Ordinarily, Unit 
Managers may change an inmate's quarters assignment for valid reasons. Unit staff must 
review an inmate's CMC Clearance and Separatee Data before moving an inmate. Prior 
to moving an inmate classified as a disruptive group member or in the posted picture file, 
the Unit Manager must confer with the SIS Office to ensure there exists no other security 
reason preventing the move. To avoid sensitive information being brought onto the 
units, the Unit Managers can confer with the CMC who has SENTRY access to Security 
Threat Group (STG) information. Also, the Unit Manager must consult with the C&A 
Officer before making the move to ensure the institutional count is not disrupted and for 
further review of the inmate's CMC Clearance and Separatee Data. 
3. 
High Security Cases: Those inmates identified as requiring a greater degree of security 
and control, but who do not require placement in the Special Housing Unit, are to be 
placed on higher floors for increased security. Pretrial inmates whose presence in the 
general population would pose a threat to the security or orderly running of the institution 
will be housed in administrative detention in the Special Housing Unit. 
E. 
Admission and Orientation (A&O): An Institutional A&O Program for pretrial inmates is not 
required. Based on the extreme population pressures, unique needs to separate inmates by floor 
and constant movement, inmates identified in this section will not be required to receive 
institution and unit A & O, however, upon intake screening they will receive the following: 
1. Inmate Rights and Responsibilities (located in the A & O Handbook) 
2. Bureau Prohibited Acts and Disciplinary System (located in the A & O Handbook) 
3. Completion of the Inmate Acknowledgment Forms (BP-S407/408) 
A&O Handbooks are posted on all general population units in English and Spanish. All new 
commitments housed in the Special Housing Unit receive a copy of the handbook. 
F. 
Visiting: Immediate family members and one person of "meaning" will be placed on the visiting 
list absent strong circumstances that preclude visiting. Immediate family is defined as mother, 
father, step-parents, step-children, foster parents, grand-children, brothers, sisters, spouse and 
children. As the situation presents itself, other non-immediate family members will be allowed 
to visit at the approval of the Associate Warden of Programs (AWP). Further, in circumstances, 
when an inmate requests more than ten visitors to be placed on their visiting list, the Unit 
Manager will approve / deny any visitor exceeding the limit. Pretrial inmates may complete a

visiting list for immediate family members as soon as they reach their assigned housing unit. 
Pretrial inmates have the opportunity for social visits once a week. Ordinarily, each social visit 
will last a maximum of one hour, the exception to this policy being when a visitor traveled more 
than three hours. Visiting hours for pretrial inmates are from 12:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m., and from 
5:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m., Monday thru Friday. The visiting day for each unit remains the same, 
yet the times change every other week to enable visitors to come in the afternoon and the 
evening. 
G. 
Pretrial Inmate Reviews: The Unit Manager is responsible for scheduling and documenting 
pretrial inmate reviews for all pretrial inmates assigned to his/her unit. Each pretrial inmate 
committed to this institution will be scheduled for a review within 21 days of admission. 
Subsequent reviews will be conducted every 90 days. It is the responsibility of the Case 
Manager and the Counselor to obtain the necessary information in order to hold a meaningful 
review. The Pretrial Inmate Review Report (BP-S561.073) shall be used to document these 
reviews. If an inmate refuses to attend a scheduled review, staff shall document the refusal, and if 
known, the reason. The emphasis of this review will be placed on the inmate's current legal 
proceedings, institutional adjustment, work/sanitation evaluations, and program recommendation 
based on needs and availability. The unit team should also review the inmate's CIM status, and 
document the review in the file (i.e. on team sheet, activity record in FOI Exempt section). Unit 
staff should also verify the accuracy of all load data and update Sentry as needed. A pretrial 
inmate review must have at a minimum, two Unit Staff in attendance. A docket containing the 
names of general population inmates scheduled for review should be posted in the multipurpose 
area of the unit at least 48 hours prior to the scheduled review. 
The Unit Manager is also responsible for monitoring the inmate's pretrial status. Once an 
inmate pleads guilty/is convicted, the inmate's Admission/Release status should be updated by 
CS to reflect holdover status rather than pretrial status. These inmates are no longer considered 
to be pretrial inmates. Once the inmate changes to A-HLD status, conducting a team is no longer 
necessary. However, the Case Manager shall ensure that monitoring of these cases are 
conducted informally through an informal interview documented on the Activity Log. Unit staff 
must carefully monitor the status of the cases of those inmates who have been identified as 
requiring a greater degree of security and control, or those inmates involved in high profile cases. 
All pretrial inmates are normally classified as IN custody. Ordinarily, there should be no reason 
to consider changing a pretrial inmate's custody. Changes in the custody levels of pretrial 
inmates should only occur in rare cases. If unusual circumstances occur, the unit team must 
refer a recommendation to increase an inmate's custody from IN to MAXIMUM to the Warden 
for approval. The Regional Director must approve a reduction of a pretrial inmate's custody 
from IN to a lower custody level.

H. 
File Accountability: Unit Management inmate files will be maintained in the CS. All files 
must be maintained consistent with the Program Statement and supplement pertaining to central 
files. All files are to be counted quarterly, with a SENTRY generated roster. All files must be 
secured at all times and no file may be left in a staff's office overnight. For specific handling 
procedures, the supplement on central files should be referenced. 
I. 
Property: Beyond those items issued by CSstaff during the admission process, section III(AX3) 
within, further clothing is issued by the Laundry Department to balance out the amount allowed 
by local policy. Approved clothing for pretrial inmates is listed in the institution supplement on 
Inmate Personal Property. Other items such as bar soap, laundry detergent, additional 
disposable razors, paper, pencils, and envelopes are distributed on each housing unit. 
Once arraigned and remanded to custody, all personal clothing will be shipped to an address 
provided by the inmate. Lock boxes are not used at this facility. The committing federal agents 
of newly arrested persons who have not been arraigned are responsible for safeguarding all 
money and valuable items until inmates are remanded to custody, at which time the inmates will 
forward all valuables to a person identified by themselves; monies will be credited to their 
commissary accounts. 
A pretrial inmate may have two sets of court clothes delivered to the institution for a jury trial or 
for sentencing. Court clothing requests must be approved by a member of the unit team 48 
hours prior to the delivery of the clothing. Clothing exchange is Mondays, Wednesdays, 
Thursdays, and Fridays from 12:30 p.m. to 1:30 p.m., excluding holidays, in the front lobby. 
Pretrial inmates may retain clothing items such as T-shirts, shorts, sweatshirts and sweatpants 
purchased at other institutions. Pretrial inmates may also retain all legal work, including audio 
tapes, pertaining to their current legal action. 
J. 
Education: The Education Department provide pretrial inmates with educational opportunities 
such as Adult Continuing Education (ACE). The Education Department maintains the 
institution's law library. A satellite law library is also maintained in the Special Housing Unit. 
Pretrial inmates have the opportunity to spend a reasonable amount of time to do legal research 
and prepare legal documents in the Law Library. More specifically, to obtain certain legal 
materials pretrial inmates may make copies of legal materials via use of the debit card system. 
Inmates who claim indigence must obtain the Indigence Form in Education and have it approved 
by their unit team. Inmates may check out materials by consulting with staff from the Education 
Department. The Education Department will provide current newspapers, including Spanish 
Newspapers, to each pretrial unit.

K. Recreation: Pretrial inmates may participate in recreation activities from 6:00 a.m. until 11:00 
p.m., except during official counts. Movies are shown on the units on weekends via the 
Closed-Circuit Television System. The Recreation Department conducts outdoor recreation 
seven days a week, and rotates the pretrial units' access to the roof on a daily basis. Pretrial 
inmates have access to approximately five hours of outdoor recreation a week. 
L. 
Legal Resources: The institution's Legal Department will coordinate and approve all legal 
activities unique to a pretrial facility. Examples of these activities include arranging 
co-defendant meetings, and providing inmates and defense attorneys with video tape players to 
review video tapes. Unit staff will deliver audio tapes to those inmates who receive them from 
their defense attorney or the U.S. Attorneys Office. Unit staff will also provide inmates with 
tape players to review their tapes. Read-only computer CD access is available in the Education 
Department if inmates' attorneys send legal material on CDs. Pretrial inmates may make 
unmonitored calls to his/her attorney by submitting a request to a member of their unit team. 
Staff will not limit a pretrial inmate's access to unmonitored legal calls, however, these calls are 
granted to the extent that staff resources allow and must meet the requirements as stated in the 
Program Statement Legal Activities, Inmate. All legal mail sent to pretrial inmates is opened in 
their presence. Pretrial inmates may meet with their attorneys in the Attorney Conference Room 
ordinarily from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m., each day, including weekends and holidays. Exceptions 
to these times are made on a case by case basis. 
M. 
Institutional Work Assignments: All pretrial inmates are responsible for housekeeping tasks 
in their rooms and in the common living areas. Pretrial inmates may be assigned as unit 
orderlies and receive performance pay. Each pretrial unit shall have no more than 12 orderly 
positions. Pretrial inmates may also be assigned a work detail outside the confines of the unit, 
provided the inmates do not have separatees in the building and are not a security risk. The unit 
team will review each inmate's eligibility for a work assignment during pretrial inmate reviews. 
A pretrial inmate does not earn extra good time. The unit team must ensure Section IV of the 
Notice of Separation/Work Waiver form is executed prior to an inmate's assignment to any work 
detail. Any pre-trial inmate, not on writ from a state facility, whose status changes to holdover 
by virtue of the fact the inmate has been convicted or pled guilty, is eligible to work. This 
policy is contingent upon the fact the inmate does not have any separatees in the building. 
N. 
Community Activities: All pretrial inmates remain in the custody of the USM Service until 
convicted by the Court, and therefore, are not eligible for community-based activities. In the 
case of an emergency, unit staff shall facilitate contact with the pretrial inmate's attorney, who 
may seek from the Court a decision concerning release from custody, or an escorted trip. 
Additionally, unit staff will notify the U.S. Attorney's Office and the USM of the emergency. 
Staff shall document contact with each of these agencies in the inmate's file. Release of the 
inmate requires a Court Order, and an escorted trip must be approved by the Court. Ordinarily, 
the USM Service will provide the escorts. This rule does not apply to emergency medical trips 
to a local hospital.

O. 
Religious Programs: Pretrial inmates in general population may participate in religious group 
activities. Staff may enlist the aid of contract or volunteer personnel to assist in the ministering 
of pretrial inmates. Due to the large number of separatees housed at this facility, any inmate 
who appears on the institution's daily separation roster may not attend group services in the 
Chapel located on Unit 5 North. Religious services for female inmates will be conducted in the 
programs room of the female unit. Pretrial inmates who have separatees, and those housed in 
the Special Housing Unit, must be ministered to individually on his/her unit. Inmates have the 
opportunity to fill out a Religious Preference Summary during Intake Screening 
P. 
Marriage: Pretrial inmates may request permission to marry in accordance with current BOP 
policy. Unit staff shall contact the Court, the U.S. Attorney's Office, and in the case of an alien, 
the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement to advise them of the marriage request of 
the inmate and to request their comments. 
Psychiatric and Psychological Counseling: Due to the transient nature of pretrial inmates, 
individual counseling is limited to inmate needs, resolutions, and crisis intervention. Pretrial 
inmates may be allowed the opportunity to receive counseling services by submitting a "Request 
to a Staff Member" to the Psychology Department. Further, should inmates have any drug 
dependency issues the 40-Hour Drug Program is available to pretrial male and female inmates 
via submitting a "Request to a Staff Member" to the Psychology Department. 
It 
Death or Serious Illness: In the event of death or serious illness, unit staff shall prepare letters, 
for the Warden's signature, notifying the committing Court, the United States Attorney, the 
inmate's attorney of record, and the designated family member or next of kin, and other agency 
with an interest (i.e. Consulate). 
S. 
Discipline: Pretrial inmates are required to abide by the Bureau of Prisons rules and 
regulations. New commitments are provided with the inmates' rights and responsibilities. 
Regulations pertaining to discipline - prohibited acts, types of disciplinary actions which may be 
taken, and the disciplinary system within the institution - are posted on all units, except in the 
Special Housing Unit, and are explicit in the Admission and Orientation Booklet. 
The respective Unit Manager is responsible for ensuring a letter, signed by the Warden, is 
forwarded to the Court, through the U.S. Marshal, advising the Court of any findings of guilt, for 
serious high and greatest severity incident reports, by the Discipline Hearing Officer (DHO). 
Furthermore, if the inmate violates any of the rules and regulations of the Bureau of Prisons, a 
letter will be sent to the United States Probation Office and prosecuting Assistant United States 
Attorney which specifies all violations. Upon an inmate's plea of guilt/conviction, the discipline 
history of the inmate will be reviewed by the respective Unit Manager, or designee.

Please see the below email chain regarding the SHU attorney conference room issue. 
»agy 
Cross-Goldenberg 
Hi 
Just to note one additional wrinkle that is easily solved: 
7/30/2019 4:28 PM >» 
Today, it sounds like our staff observed that Epstein's lawyers were able to hold onto the SHU room even 
after they had met with him while they waited to meet with him again. No one else gets that privilege. If 
a client has to be taken back to the unit, or to medical, or otherwise leave the attorney visiting area, we 
would have to leave, too. If he needs to be taken to another location, and his attorneys want to meet 
with him again, the facility can require them to get back in line like the rest of us. 
Today alone we had one attorney give up after waiting in the lobby for 2.5 hours. We had another 
attorney wait for three hours. That included a wait of an hour and fifteen minutes 'after he got to the 
SHU room while Epstein was brought *backs to the room his lawyers had been holding and while medical 
visited him there regarding some paperwork for his fish allergy. 
We have attorneys who urgently need to see clients this week. We urgently need a solution. 
Thanks, 
Peggy

Thanks for getting back to us, 
. Just a heads up that we will likely file something with Judge Rakoff 
in Sayoc. Our attorneys have not been able to meet with him, and his sentencing is coming up. If there's 
some alternative, please let me know.

No worries about tomorrow. Take care of your business. I knew he didn't tell you because I was receiving 
calls and they said they tried to reach him and he wouldn't answer. But it's ok. I'll deal with it. Yesterday 
was a ghost town as well. 
said it was 13 vacant posts. Please ensure the staff in SHU make the 
rounds or get assistance with the rounds. Maybe Activities. Not only due to Epstein but one of the 
reasons. If any non-custody come in, please use them. I'm here if you need me. Thanks.

Good morning Ma'am I was on staff assist all week at Danbury so I had no idea that he designated me 
this weekend so I'm really sorry about that. I'll help out as soon as I'm done with 
tomorrow and 
take care of things on Tuesday so you won't have to worry about anything. 
FYI, we are on modified status today. Staff search, Internal, 5 south, 7 south, SHU 3 and 4, are 
vacated. We are doing attorney visits though but we may have to cancel religious services. Enjoy your 
Sunday...

No worries. He designated you as the Captain this weekend and I am sure you weren't aware of it. I got 
all the calls. He's not answering the phone so I'm sure you won't get a response. I will deal with things 
tomorrow. 
both also have a lot going on. We will be fine. Thank you.

TEXT htm 
Good afternoon all, 
Below please find complaints from Epstein's attorneys. Can you check to see if he has toilet paper and 
that his CPAP is plugged in? 
I am less concerned regarding his complaint of having had two calls, but they were on unmonitored lines, 
so there is no recording of them. Is his phone account set up so he can get a call on the ITS when 30 
days has elapsed? 
you,

Good afternoon 
Our client, Jeffrey Epstein. has informed us that he has no toilet paper in his cell. His CPap machine was 
not plugged in last night, so he was unable to use it. 
Also, since his arrival at MCC, he has only been able to make two fifteen minute phone calls. Both times, 
the calls were on speaker phone, with officers present. 
Thank you in advance for your help. 
Best,

Hi Bruce, 
It is my understanding that the investigation has concluded and that no charges, 
disciplinary or otherwise, are being filed against your client. I hope this helps. 
Also, I have notified the Duty Officer and Captain, and will notify the Lieutenants that 
you plan to visit first thing Sunday morning.

I just got off the phone with Central Office and they are recommending we conduct a suicide risk 
assessment with this inmate when he returns from court. Should he retum from court and psychology is 
gone for the day, he is to go on PSYCHOLOGICAL OBSERVATION unless, of course, he reports he is 
suicidal. In that case, he is to go on Suicide Watch. Inmate Epstein will likely be receiving bad news in 
court today and has multiple risk factors for suicidality as identified by BOP statistics. Let's be 
proactive. 
"This writer consulted with 
Central Office, regarding inmate Epstein. Inmate Epstein 
has various risk factors for suicidality including a high profile case with media attention, sex offense 
charges, pre-trial status, and a court proceeding today which could potentially be giving him bad news 
regarding his legal situation. As such, when inmate Epstein retums from court, R&D staff as well as 
Lieutenant's have been informed to immediately notify the psychology department. If he returns after 
duty hours, the aforementioned staff were instructed to notify the on-call psychologist and to place 
inmate Epstein on a watch status until psychology can conduct a thorough suicide risk assessment."

I just got off the phone with Central Office and they are recommending we conduct a suicide risk assessment with this inmate when he 
returns from court. Should he return from court and psychology is gone for the day, he is to go on PSYCHOLOGICAL OBSERVATION 
unless, of course, he reports he is suicidal. In that case, he is to go on Suicide Watch. Inmate Epstein will likely be receiving bad 
news in court today and has multiple risk factors for suicidality as identified by BOP statistics. Let's be proactive. 
"This writer consulted with Dr.-, 
Central Office, regarding inmate Epstein. Inmate Epstein has various risk factors for 
suicidality including a high profile case with media attention, sex offense charges, pre-trial status, and a court proceeding today which 
could potentially be giving him bad news regarding his legal situation. As such, when inmate Epstein returns from court, R&D staff as 
well as Lieutenant's have been informed to immediately notify the psychology department. If he returns after duty hours, the 
aforementioned staff were instructed to notify the on-call psychologist and to place inmate Epstein on a watch status until psychology 
can conduct a thorough suicide risk assessment." 
Thank you, Dr

Good morning, 
I don't know why the Chaplain didn't button these two inmates up.

1. Although having a religious preference of "UNKNOWN," inmate Johnson, Jermaine (86461-054 - 9N) came on the Jumah move 
and made an ALL EYES ON ME grand entrance into 5N, shouting and waving his arms and hands as he walked to the Chapel, trash-
talking with the inmates secured on multiple 5N tiers, getting many inmates worked-up & causing a lot of noise in the unit. I told him his 
behavior was unacceptable and that I expected him to leave in a calm & quiet manner when the service was over. Then, in the middle 
of the Muslim sermon, inmate Torres, Joshua (86521-054 - 5N) came up to the secure Chapel door and proceeded to engage in a non-
verbal conversation through the door window with Johnson while he was seated in a chair for the Muslim service, and Johnson was 
more than willing to engage in the charade-based conversation. As I approached the door, inmate Torres went to an unknown tier/cell. 
I then stood near the door and a few minutes later, inmate Torres came half-way up the stairs to the Chapel trying to communicate with 
Johnson again. I addressed the matter with them both. Torres respectfully apologized but Johnson just ran his legendary mouth, hence 
his 30 day restriction from chapel services. 
2. The RAC Ms. 
notified me on Thursday, July 18 that the Saturday volunteers (= 
were not able to 
m
in until they completed their training on July 29. I notified them via telephone so they would not make the trip to the institution. 
confirmed that he plans on attending the training on July 29, and his wife is trying to make arrangements to get off work to do 
the same. Also, I delivered memos to each housing unit and had Control announce the cancellation of the Saturday service. 
3. After I delivered the sign-up sheets to all the units for the English Christian service on Sunday and after the 10am count cleared, 5N 
Officer 
notified me that he received a drop note about a gang fight planned during the church service that day (see attached). 
he Lts., and the Lts. notified me that they felt it best to cancel the service. I immediately notified volunteer 
, who confirmed he would be able to come on his next scheduled Sunday to provide the Christian service on Aug. 4. I also 
had control announce the cancellation of the Sunday service. 
4. I added inmate Epstein to the CFSA roster, and interviewed inmate Encarnacion, adding him to the roster as well. 
5. I escorted the Rabbi on Sunday to all units with active Jewish inmates, including 11S which was locked down.

Synopsis: On July 23, 2019, at 1:27 a.m., staff responded to a call for assistance in the Special 
Housing Unit (SHU). Upon arrival, the Operations Lieutenant found inmate Epstein, Jeffrey, 
Register No. 76318-054, lying on the floor in a fetal position. The Lieutenant called out to the 
inmate; however, he did not respond and she noticed red marks on his neck. The inmate was 
placed in hand restraints and escorted to the Suicide Cell and placed on Suicide Watch. While 
on watch, the inmate indicated that his cell mate had attempted to kill him and had been 
harassing him and he had informed his Attorney of this matter. 
Medical Assessment: The inmate was medically assessed at 6:30 a.m., by the Physician 
Assistant and his findings were as follows: 
He is ambulatory, oriented x 3. In no apparent distress, smiling during this clinical encounter. 
Alleges, that he does not know what happened. Cannot explain the marks on his neck. 
Responded: "I don't know". 
He does not want to talk of the events leading to the marks on his neck. 
He does not look in any distress or pain. 
Has a circular line of erythema at the base of the neck. Reaching 2/3 of the neck 
circumference, 2 inches wide, sparing the back of the neck. Has one section of this erythema 
in the front with marks of friction. 
No inflammation, no deformities, no hematomas, no lacerations, no tenderness. Patient 
moving his neck without any restriction. Denies having any pain or discomfort. Denies any 
respiratory problem. 
Has another small erythema on left knee about 2cm in diameter (mild).

determined he will remain on Suicide Watch for further observation.

population in Unit 7 South. We are currently looking for the appropriate cell mate.

I saw him before his Legal visit. He seems stable and is now at his Legal visit. I'll be coming in tomorrow before his Legal 
visit to see him again. 
He complained about being dehydrated because he stated he cannot drink enough water because of limited bathroom breaks 
in Legal since he stated he sees his Attorney for about 12 hours. 
He also complained about having to go back up to SHU. Being anxious about it and not being able to sleep there because of 
the noise of inmates banging and screaming at night.

Inmate Epstein seems psychologically stable. 
He complained that his right arm was numb and hanging earlier. Nurse 
saw him. 
He again said his right arm still feels somewhat numb and he said he cannot make a fist with that hand. Fle also said he has 
numbness on his neck. I informed Nurse 
He stated the toilet in his cell was running for 45 minutes last night and he could not take the noise. He is going to try the 
toilet before going to legal today and if it does not shut off, he will be moved to another cell.

y received one meal, a sandwich at about 4:15 PM. He said he should be getting lunch and dinner. 
Also additional information on the toilet that reportedly flushed for 45 minutes. He stated to avoid the toilet from doing that 
again because he stated he found it so aversive and disorienting, he has been urinating in a cup. I already sent an e-
mail to Mr. 
about the toilet.

Inmate Epstein seems psychologically stable. 
He complained that his right arm was numb and hanging earlier. Nurse 
saw him. 
He again said his right arm still feels somewhat numb and he said he cannot make a fist with that hand. He also said he has nu 
mbness on his neck. I informed Nurse 
He stated the toilet in his cell was running for 45 minutes last night and he could not take the noise. He is going to try the toil 
et before going to legal today and if it does not shut off, he will be moved to another cell. 
Thanks,

No worries about tomorrow. Take care of your business. I knew he didn't tell you because I was 
receiving calls and they said they tried to reach him and he wouldn't answer. But it's ok. I'll deal 
with it. Yesterday was a ghost town as well.. said it was 13 vacant posts. Please ensure the 
staff in SHU make the rounds or get assistance with the rounds. Maybe Activities. Not only due 
to Epstein but one of the reasons. If any non-custody come in, please use them. I'm here if you 
need me. Thanks.

it. I got all the calls. He's not answeringSe phone so I'm sure you won't get a response. I will 
deal with things tomorrow. 
and 
both also have a lot going on. We will be fine. 
Thank you.
