The Firm will provide those legal services reasonably required to represent the Client including fad 
and law investigation, drafting pleadings, settlement efforts, and other services up to and including 
trial. The Firm will take reasonable steps to keep the Client informed of material developments and 
timely respond to Client inquiries. 
The Firm is representing the Client only in the matters described above, appellate services arc outside 
the scope of this Agreement and a separate written agreement for appellate services or in any other 
matter will be required. The Firm cannot provide the Client with tax advice and the Client is 
encouraged to consult with tax advisors concerning this matter, particularly in the event of 
settlement or other monetary resolution.

CLIENT'S DUTIES 
The Client agrees to be truthful with the Firm, to keep the Firm informed of any information or 
developments which may come to the Client's attention, to advise the Firm of all relevant 
information and any change in contact information, and to abide by this Agreement. The Client will 
assist the Firm by providing necessary information and documents and, to the extent practicable, 
locating witnesses. The Client agrees to appear at all necessary proceedings and to cooperate fully 
with the Firm in all matters related to the preparation, presentation, and prosecution of the Claim(s). 
The Client understands that this representation and the resolution of the Claims is likely to be 
complicated and time-consuming (including time-consuming of the Client's time). While the Firm 
will attempt to keep the Client apprised of material developments, the Firm cannot predict with any 
certainty the outcome or timing of these matters. 
3. 
ATTORNEY'S FEE 
The Attorney's Fee to be paid to the Firm for work on the Claims is contingent on the result. The amount 
of the Attorney's Fee is different depending on the type of Claim(s) asserted. As to any Claims

Federal Bureau of Investigation, if the Claims arc resolved before a lawsuit is filed, the Client shall pay 
the Finn an attorney's fee equal to twenty percent (20%) of any Amount Recovered. Once a lawsuit 
is filed on a Client's behalf, the Client shall pay the Firm an attorney's fee equal to twenty-five 
percent (25%) of any Amount Recovered. As to any other Claims, regardless of the nature of the 
Claim, when the Claim is resolved, or the type of suit (such as an individual or class action), the 
Client shall pay the Firm an attorney's fee equal to one-third (331/394) of the "Amount Recovered." 
If there is no Amount Recovered, the Client will have no responsibility to repay the "Firm for Costs, 
Disbursements, and Litigation Expenses" ("Expenses"). If there is an Amount Recovered but the

Marsh Law Firm ("Firm") and 
("Client") (the Firm and Client 
together are the "Parties", the Firm or Client individually is a "Party") hereby agree that the Firm will 
provide legal services to the Client on the terms set forth below. 
I. 
SCOPE OF LEGAL SERVICES 
The Client hires the Firm to provide legal services concerning any and all past, present, and future 
legal causes of adion or claims associated with, corollary to. or arising from any and all allegations or 
instances of sexual abuse involving the Client and Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell. and/or any 
others participating in or in any way connected to Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking insofar as those 
causes of action or claims arc against or involve the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department 
of Justice, and/or other city, state, and/or federal government entities' failure to investigate Jeffrey 
Epstein and his co-conspirators.. This includes all causes of action or claims—including criminal, 
civil, and other—arising from these allegations or instances, whether in connedion with one or more 
individual or multi-party case(s) or class aCtion(s). These causes of adion and claims are defined 
collectively as the "Claims." 
The Client has not retained any other attomey(s) in connection with the Claims. The Client 
previously retained counsel to pursue claims against the Epstein estate, JP Morgan/Deutsche Bank. 
and perhaps others relating to Epstein's sex trafficking operation. The retention of those attorneys 
has either been concluded or do not encompass/apply to the Claims. 
Although we arc not currently aware of claims relating to your image(s), in the event that such claims 
exist, the Client also hires the Firm to provide legal services concerning all past, present, and future 
legal causes of action or claims associated with, corollary to, or arising from all photographic, digital, 
film or any other image(s) or likeness of the Client located anywhere worldwide. This includes all 
legal causes of adion—including copyright, tort. equity, and civil—arising from the creation, 
distribution, and possession of the Client's child sex abuse material ("CSAM"), images, videos, or 
likeness by any person, corporation, or other public, private, or nonprofit entity or syndicate

The phrase "legal causes of adion" also includes, if applicable, all restitution requested. ordered, or 
paid which is associated with, corollary to, or arising from any actual or potential criminal cause of 
action in which the Client is, could, or might be named a victim. These causes of adion and claims 
are also included in the "Claims."

postage (at cost); and computerized legal research. Expenses also include the cost of retaining 
specialized legal counsel necessary for the Firm to pursue the Client's Claims including, for example, 
bankruptcy counsel and trusts and estates counsel. 
Expenses also include the cost of investigators, consultants, and expert witnesses. The Firm will seleU 
the expert witnesses, consultants, and investigators, and notify the Client of the individuals or firms 
hired and, where feasible, an estimation of their charges. 
If there are multiple ongoing and potential future cases concerning the Claims, the Client 
acknowledges that the Firm may retain some or all of the Amount Recovered in one case in order to 
pay past and current Expenses as well as retaining funds for future Expenses.

SANCTIONS 
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement whether express or implied, the Client agrees 
that any award of attorney's fees or Expenses, whether by settlement, mediation, arbitration award, 
judgment, or otherwise, belongs exclusively to the Firm. The receipt of awarded attorney's fees or 
Expenses will be credited against the total amount owed by the Client under this Agreement. 
Therefore, the Client agrees that the attorney's fees and Expenses payable to the Firm pursuant to this 
Agreement shall be the greater of: (i) the amount otherwise owed to the Firm under this Agreement; 
or (ii) the amount of the awarded attorney's fees and Expenses. 
The Client agrees that any attorney's fees or Expenses awarded as part of discovery or other 
extraordinary motion praaicc or sanaions proceedings is not considered part of the Amount 
Recovered and belongs exclusively to the Firm as additional compensation for extraordinary time and 
effort. 
NOTE: If an award of attorney's fees or Expenses is received or sought on the Client's behalf, the 
Client understands that the amount awarded is the amount the court, mediator, or arbitrator believes 
the party is entitled to recover. This does not determine the amount of attorney's fees or Expenses the 
Firm is entitled to charge the Client, or that only the attorney's fees and Expenses which arc awarded 
are reasonable. 
9. 
CLIENT APPROVAL NECESSARY FOR SETTLEMENT 
The Client has the right to accept or rejeU any settlement or compromise of the Claims. The Firm 
will not settle or compromise any of the Claims without the Client's prior approval. Once the Client 
agrees to a settlement, the Client authorizes the Firm and grants the Firm a limited power of attorney

2. 
IOINT REPRESENTATION 
The Client consents to the Firm representing others who have claims which arc similar or identical to 
the Client's Claims, induding others who have claims against one or more of the same defendants as 
Client. The Client authorizes the Firm to disclose any Client's pseudonym to the other Clients. 
i. 
JOINT PROSECUTION 
The Client consents to Client's claims being joined with those of other Clients in one or more 
lawsuits, actions, or claim resolution processes. 
4. 
CONFLICTS
The Client acknowledges that the Firm may represent others who have claims against one or more of 
the same defendants as Client. The Client waives any conflicts of interest that may arise in this 
situation, including any conflict that could result from Client and the Firm's other clients each 
pursuing a financial recovery from one or more of the same defendants. The Client also recognizes 
that circumstances might arise in which the Firm may be prevented or disqualified from representing 
the Client in a particular case or cases. The Firm will promptly inform the Client of any such 
situation that may require such withdrawal. By signing below, the Client acknowledges these risks 
and consents to such waiver and withdrawal. 
Furthermore, in the event the Client at any time and for any reason elects to discontinue its 
engagement of the Firm, or if an adverse relationship arises between the Client and any of the Finn's 
other clients, the Client acknowledges and agrees that the Firm may continue without restriction to 
represent the Firm's other clients in any and all matters, including those that rise from or relate to 
any case, including the case in which the conflict(s) arose. 
5. 
DECISION MAKING 
The Client understands that many of the decisions during the course of the representation are 
tactical and will be made by the Finn. On occasion, decisions will need to be made jointly by the 
Client and the Firm's other clients. Certain other decisions will be made by each of the individual 
clients in consultation with the Firm. Client understands that he or she will always retain the 
authority to decide whether to settle or otherwise resolve his or her individual claim. 
6. 
SETTLEMENT STRATEGY AND COMMON FUND SETTLEMENT 
The Client understands that it is unlikely that any two cases will have the same value, either for 
settlement or at trial. Every case has different facts, strengths, weaknesses, and risks, and the Client 
understands that at trial or in settlement negotiations. the Firm, in consultation with its clients, may 
assign a value to each client's claim and is likely to assign a higher value to some claims than to 
others. The Client understands that a judge, a bankruptcy judge, a bankruptcy trustee, a jury, or any 
neutral third party who helps resolve the Client's case might, for purposes of convenience, minimize 
the differences among different plaintiffs. Moreover, for purposes of settlement, defendants might do 
the same.

story, it will be very hard to argue that everyone's story is untrue. (For a good example. read New 
York Magazine's 'I'm No Longer Afraid: 35 Women Tell Their Stories About Being Assaulted by Bill 
Cosli and the Culture That Wouldn't Listen htipslitinytirl tom/ i5(:osbyAceters). 
Furthermore, if the jury hears multiple cases where the abuse survivor failed for many years to fully 
confront the effects of the abuse, it will help them understand that common phenomenon. Likewise, 
defendants are more likely to lack credibility with a jury. for example. when arguing they should not 
have realized victims were in danger in the face of overwhelming evidence that multiple victims were 
being abused by the same person(s). Lastly. the stronger a case becomes, the more likely the 
defendant will agree to a reasonable and early settlement. 
If you decide not to join forces with other plaintiffs, we will still try to offer evidence from other 
abuse survivors for the reasons described above, but the defendant(s) will most likely vigorously try 
to exclude that evidence. On some level, having multiple plaintiffs in the same case makes it easier 
for the judge to see why the evidence should be admitted. 
REASONS AGAINST JOINING MULTIPLE PLAINTIFFS IN THE SAME CASE 
It is possible that a weak case or unsympathetic plaintiff will drag down other stronger cases or more 
sympathetic plaintiffs. No two cases have the same value, same losses, or same damages, which is why 
our Firm has generally recommended against class action lawsuits in child sex abuse cases, at least as 
to damages. Thus, a person with a particularly strong case may not want his or her case "diluted" by 
weaker cases. In addition, joining together in one case puts everyone's "eggs in one basket." Although 
juries are instructed to consider each case on its own merits, something bad about one of the 
plaintiffs could negatively affect all of the plaintiffs. 
In addition, each plaintiff loses some measure of control over their individual case and over the 
aggregate costs. While you always have the right to decide whether to resolve your case, such as 
whether to accept a settlement or whether to go through a jury trial, some procedural decisions will 
likely have to be made by a vote. There may be many such decisions during a case and there may be 
possible disagreement and hurt feelings. You must agree in advance to participate in joint decision 
making and to abide by decisions that you might not agree with. 
In addition, there is always the risk that a jury might have difficulty keeping the facts straight if it 
hears evidence about multiple plaintiffs in the same case. 
Lastly, when you join with other plaintiffs, it is possible that the resolution of your case might be 
delayed by a development in one or more of the other cases. 
OUR REASONS FOR REPRESENTING MULTIPLE CLIENTa 
One advantage of representing multiple clients is that the work of our Firm will benefit multiple 
people at the same time. For example, we often spend considerable time and resources working to 
find evidence to hold the defendant(s) liable for what our clients endured. Similarly, we often find

breaches of confidentiality. security, and other such risks commonly associated with such 
technologies which are beyond the Firm's reasonable control. 
15. 
DISCHARGE AND WITHDRAWAL 
The Client may discharge the Firm at any time. The Client expressly consents to the Firm 
unilaterally withdrawing at any time and for any reason in accordance with attorney ethics, 
professional rules of conduct, and applicable laws, regulations, and policies. 
Among the circumstances under which Firm may withdraw are: (a) with the consent of the Client; 
(b) the Client's conduct renders it unreasonably difficult for the Firm to carry out the representation 
effectively; and (c) the Client fails to pay Expenses as required by this Agreement. 
Notwithstanding the Client's notice of discharge, and without regard to the reasons for the Firm's 
withdrawal or Client's discharge, the Client remains obligated to pay the Firm for Expenses incurred 
prior to the withdrawal or discharge and, in the event that there is any Amount Recovered after the 
withdrawal or discharge, the Client remains obligated to pay the Firm Attorney's Fee from the 
effective date of this Agreement to the date of discharge. If the Firm withdraws without cause, the 
Firm waives and will not be entitled to recover any Attorney's Fee. 
The Client understands that this representation and the resolution of the Claims is likely to be 
complicated and time-consuming (including time-consuming of the Client's time). While the Firm 
will attempt to keep the Client apprised of material developments, the Finn cannot predict with any 
certainty the outcome or timing of these matters. 
16. 
CONCLUSION OF SERVICES 
The Client may have access to the Client's case file at any reasonable time. At the end of the 
engagement, the Client may request the Client's case file. If the Client has not requested the Client's 
file, and to the extent the Firm has not otherwise delivered it or disposed of it consistent with the 
Client's instructions, the Firm will retain the case file for a period of three years after which the Firm 
is authorized to destroy the case file. If the Client wants the Firm to maintain the case file for more 
than three years after the Firm's services have concluded, a separate written agreement must be 
executed between the Firm and the Client which may include the expense of maintaining or 
transferring the case file. The Firm is authorized to retain copies of the case file in perpetuity at the 
Firm's expense.

If there is an Amount Recovered, the Attorney's Fee shall be paid to the Firm at the following time, 
whichever is earlier: (a) no later than the time when payment is made to the Client or (b) the earliest 
time when payment is offered or otherwise made available to the Client. (For example, if the Client 
decides to receive installment payments or a structured settlement rather than a lump sum amount. 
or if the Client elects to defer payment into a later year, the Firm will nonetheless have the option of 
receiving the Firm's payment in a lump sum at the earliest time such amount is otherwise available to 
the Client). 
The Amount Recovered may be in the form of money or non-monetary proceeds which includes, 
but is not limited to, the provision of benefits or other forms of compensation, recovery on 
insurance, stock, stock options. real property costs as taxed on a judgment (including interest), and 
any other item of value. To the extent the Amount Recovered includes items of value that are not 
cash, the Client agrees that the Firm has the option of receiving all or some of the Attorney's Fee in 
the form of either the item of value or its cash equivalent. 
The following or similar items are not considered Expenses: liens, assignments, and claims in favor of 
hospitals, medical care, and mental health treatment, and reimbursements to self-insurers or 
insurance carriers. If applicable, such items will he paid from Client's net share of the Amount 
Recovered. 
The Client agrees that the Amount Recovered will be paid directly to the Firm and deposited in the 
Firm's client trust account from which the Firm may immediately deduct the Attorney's Fee and any 
Expenses and then distribute to the Client, no sooner than ten business days after receipt, the 
Client's portion of the Amount Recovered. In addition. to the extent applicable, feasible, and 
permissible, and at the Finn's sole election, the Firm may receive the Attorney's Fee either in an 
immediate lump sum, in future periodic payments. or in any combination of a lump sum and future 
periodic payments. The Client agrees to cooperate with the Firm by endorsing and executing any 
documents required to achieve this outcome. The Firm's right to coiled payment of its Attorney's Fee 
cannot be otherwise assigned, transferred, pledged, or encumbered. Neither the Client nor the Firm

OVERVIEW OF THE JOINT REPRESENTATION AND PROSECUTION AGREEMENT 
The Marsh Law Firm PLLC has and will continue to represent survivors of childhood and adult 
sexual abuse and exploitation. The Firm's clients may, from time to time, be filing claims, including 
civil lawsuits, against one or more of the same defendants. We recommend that, where feasible, your 
claims be joined in the claims or lawsuits with one or more of our clients who are pursuing claims or 
lawsuits against one or more of the same defendants. This requires a joint representation agreement 
and an understanding of the joint prosecution of claims. 
There are potential conflicts of interest that an arise when an attorney represents more than one 
client with claims against the same defendant(s). Potential conflicts may also arise from joining the 
claims of several clients in the same lawsuit or claim resolution process. We are required by the rules 
of professional conduct that govern lawyers to fully disclose these risks and to obtain your consent 
before we can represent you. This is required even if there is no actual current conflict of interest. 
There are also tactical reasons for and against both joint representation and joint prosecution. This 
overview discusses the potential conflicts and the pros and cons of both joint representation and 
joint prosecution. 
We believe that, on balance, your case will be strengthened by joining forces with our other clients 
who arc pursuing claims or lawsuits against one or more of the same defendants. You arc encouraged 
to consult with another lawyer to review this issue before you make a decision. We recommend this 
because our advice concerning this issue could appear to be affected by the fact that we will 
potentially benefit from having additional clients. You should be totally comfortable and make an 
informed decision on this issue. 
There are two separate but related issues you need to decide: 
whether you will retain our law firm despite our representation of others with claims or lawsuits 
against one or more of the same defendants; and 
if you do retain our firm, whether you will join forces with others? 
It is impossible to anticipate every possibility. Therefore. the pros and cons discussed in this overview 
are illustrations based on our experience. There are undoubtedly other reasons, both for and against, 
joint prosecution and joint representation that we have not anticipated, but we believe this overview 
addresses the material pros and cons. 
REASONS IN FAVOR OF JOINING MULTIPLE CLIENTS IN THE SAME CASE 
Some of the entities and individuals involved with sexual abuse are rich and powerful. When several 
individuals band together, it helps compensate for that wealth and power; you arc stronger when you 
are part of a group than you are alone. If multiple abuse survivors are plaintiffs in the same case, each 
plaintiff's story reinforces the story of every other plaintiff. While it might be possible to believe that 
one person made up his story, when three or four or more victims come forward with the same basic 
story, it will be very hard to argue that everyone's story is untrue. (For a good example, read New

The Firm shall rake no role whatsoever in the arbitration other than to provide the arbitrator(s) with 
neutral and objective information and copies of documents and other requested material. The Firm 
cannot represent any client in the arbitration, cannot provide advice to any client concerning the 
outcome of the arbitration, and cannot tender any opinion regarding any such outcome. 
The Clients participating in arbitration shall share equally in the costs of the arbitration, and the 
Firm is authorized to compensate the arbitrator(s) from the clients' recovery in the case. 
The Client confirms that he or she has read and understands this section and voluntarily agrees to 
binding arbitration. In doing so, the Client is voluntarily giving up important constitutional rights 
to trial by judge or jury. as well as rights to appeal the arbitration decision. The Client may consult 
with an independent lawyer of the Client's choice to review these arbitration provisions, and this 
entire agreement, prior to signing this Agreement. 
IL 
COST SHARING 
The Firm is authorized to incur Expenses (as defined and provided in the Legal Services Agreement 
between the Firm and the Client) for the prosecution of each of their clients cases as they deem 
reasonable. necessary, and appropriate. 
Each client is responsible for Expenses incurred in the prosecution of his or her case as reflected in 
the Legal Services Agreement between each client and the Firm. The Client understands that some 
Expenses will be jointly incurred by the Firm for the benefit of some or all Clients, and as to those 
Expenses. each benefiting client will be responsible for that client's proportionate share of such 
Expenses. 
"Joint Expenses" are those Expenses that benefit more than one client to a significant degree. For 
example. many filing fees and depositions costs are Joint Expenses that will often significantly benefit 
each client who is joined together in the same case. 
"Individual Expenses" are those Expenses that benefit only one client or one client to a significant 
degree. For example, the cost to obtain the records of a particular client and the cost of a client's 
deposition are Individual Expenses that will often significantly benefit only one client. 
The Firm shall make an initial allocation of all Expenses, including whether an Expense is Joint or 
Individual and, if Joint, whether it will be shared by all Clients or some clients. A client may object 
to an allocation. If the Firm and the client(s) cannot agree on the allocation of Expenses, the client 
may request, and the Firm will agree to, mediation. This paragraph does not waive any right any 
client may have to a judicial accounting. 
9. 
CONFIDENTIALITY 
In the course of any cast, some of the Firm's jointly represented Clients may need to meet and 
communicate with the Firm either individually or in a group. The Client understands that such 
communication is highly confidential and that any breach of confidentiality can prejudice other

CONCLUSION 
Weighing all of these factors, we strongly believe that the advantages of joining together the claims of 
multiple clients, and jointly representing multiple clients, outweigh the potential disadvantages. In 
addition, since our firm has a great deal of experience representing survivors of sexual abuse and 
exploitation, we believe there are distinct advantages to our firm representing multiple abuse 
survivors, including yourself. 
Please review the Joint Representation Agreement and this analysis carefully, ask any questions, and 
consider our advice that you consult with another attorney concerning the issues raised both by our 
representation of multiple clients and by joining multiple clients in the same case. If you agree with 
the terms of the agreement and have carefully considered the issues in this overview please review 
and sign the following Joint Representation and Prosecution Agreement and return this entire 
document to our office. 
JOINT REPRESENTATION AND PROSECUTION AGREEMENT 
J. 
INTRODUCTION 
This is an agreement ("Agreement") between 
("Client") and the 
Marsh Law Firm PLLC ("the Firm"), and between the Client and other clients of the Firm who have 
claims against any and/or all individuals and/or entities arising from the same conduct fin which the 
Firm is representing Client under the Legal Services Agreement between Client and the Firm. 
References to the "Firm" include any other attorney the Firm associates with in the course of 
representing the Client. References to "Clients" include the Client and other parties the Firm may 
represent now or in the future who have claims arising from the same conduct for which the Firm is 
representing Client under the Legal Services Agreement between Client and the Firm. 
This Agreement will be effective with the date the Finn's first perform services. Notwithstanding 
the foregoing, this Agreement will not take effect, and the Firm will have no obligation to provide 
services until the Client provides the Firm with a signed copy of this Agreement. 
The Client has engaged the Firm to represent the Client in pursuing the claims outlined in the Legal 
Services Agreement signed by the Client (-Claims"). The Client consents to Client's Claims being 
joined in the same lawsuits, actions, or claim resolution processes with those of one or more of the 
Firm's other clients. The Client understands that joint representation by the same attorneys may have 
both advantages and disadvantages. Likewise, the Client understands that joining Client's Claims 
with those of other clients may have both advantages and disadvantages. The Client acknowledges 
that the Client has reviewed and understands the foregoing Overview of the Joint Representation 
and Prosecution Agreement that outlines various conflicts of interest that might arise and reasons for 
and against joint prosecution and joint representation.

The Client and the Firm agree that it is generally desirable to conduct settlement negotiations for 
each individual client and will endeavor to do so with each client's case negotiated separately—based 
on its own unique strengths and weaknesses—and not linked to the settlement of any other client's 
case. 
No dient may interfere with any other client's right to settle. The Client recognizes, however, that it 
is possible that an aggregate settlement might be in every Clients' interest, with a single lump sum 
fund shared by all Clients, or a joint-fund settlement with a lump sum shared by two or more 
Clients. Any two or more Clients may agree to enter into a joint-fund settlement. Neither an 
aggregate settlement nor a joint-fund settlement may be imposed upon any client. Any one client 
may choose to take his or her case to trial even though every other client chooses to settle in advance 
of trial. The Client understands that each client has the power and right to prevent an aggregate 
settlement that would settle the Client's claim. 
In the event of an aggregate or joint-hind settlement, the participating Clients may decide among 
themselves as to how the fund shall be allocated. An allocation may not be imposed on any client, 
except by Arbitration under Section 6 of this Agreement. The Firm shall have no role whatsoever in 
the allocation decision and cannot represent any client, including Client, in that process. The Client 
and the other Clients may. however, be represented by other counsel. lithe participating Clients 
cannot decide upon an allocation, the allocation decision shall be submitted to final and binding 
arbitration as provided in Section 6 of this Agreement. 
7. 
ARBITRATION 
In the event that arbitration as provided for in this agreement is necessary, it shall be conducted as 
follows: 
Except as provided below, the arbitrator shall be chosen at random from a list of qualified mediators. 
If the first name declines to serve, the second name shall be the chosen arbitrator. If he or she 
declines to serve, the third name drawn shall be the chosen arbitrator. 
The Clients in arbitration may determine, by a two-thirds vote, to have the arbitration conducted by 
a panel of three arbitrators whose decisions shall be made by a majority of the panel. In such a 
situation, six names shall be chosen at random from a list of qualified mediators with the first three 
names becoming the arbitration panel. If any of the first three names declines to serve, an additional 
name shall be selected at random from the list of qualified mediators. 
The form and rules governing the arbitration shall be at the sole discretion of the arbitrator(s). The 
decision of the arbitrator(s) will be final and cannot be appealed. except for misconduct by the 
arbitrator(s). 
The Client may be represented by independent counsel at the arbitration.

shall otherwise agree to settle, sell, or transfer any Claim without first obtaining the consent of the 
other. 
S. 
JOINT REPRESENTATION AND DIVISION OF ATTORNEY'S FEE 
The Client agrees that the Firm may seled and associate with other attorneys to assist in the 
representation ("Associated Attorney"), for example to bring legal proceedings in jurisdiaions where 
Firm attorneys arc not licensed. The Attorney's Fee will not increase by reason of this association. The 
Associated Attorney will receive a portion of the Attorney's Fee based on the rime expended and 
services provided by the Associated Attorney. 
6. 
CONFLICTS WAIVER 
The Client acknowledges that the Firm and the Associated Attorney(s) may represent other viOims 
and plaintiffs and may seek recoveries on behalf of such other viOims and plaintiffs from one or 
more of the same defendants that the Firm, and Associated Attorney(s) are seeking recovery from on 
the Client's behalf. The Client hereby waives in advance any conflict that may arise in this 
siruation(s). The Client also recognizes that circumstances might arise in which the Firm or 
Associated Attorney(s) may be prevented or disqualified from representing the Client in a particular 
case or cases. The Firm will promptly inform the Client of any such situation that may require such 
withdrawal in whole or in part. By signing this Agreement, the Client expressly acknowledges these 
risks and consents to such waiver and withdrawal. 
Furthermore, in the event the Client at any time and for any reason eleas to discharge the Firm, or if 
an adverse relationship arises between the Client and any of the Firm's other clients, the Client 
acknowledges, agrees, and consents that the Firm may continue without restriction to represent the 
Firm's other client(s) in any and all matters, induding those that arise from or relate to any Claim(s), 
including the Claim(s) in which the confliO arose. 
7. 
COSTS, DISBURSEMENTS, AND LITIGATION EXPENSES 
The Firm may incur various costs and litigation expenses in performing legal services under this 
Agreement. The Client agrees to pay all costs, disbursements, and litigation expenses paid or owed by 
the Client in connexion with the Claim(s), or which have been advanced by the Firm on the Client's 
behalf and which have not been previously paid or reimbursed to the Firm (colledively "Expenses"). 
Unless otherwise determined by the court, costs, disbursements, and litigation expenses commonly 
include court fees; jury fees; service of process charges; court and deposition reporters fees; 
transcripts; interpreter/translator fees; photocopying reprodudion costs and printing; notary fees; 
messenger and other delivery fees; postage; deposition costs; reasonable travel expenses including

that one client's story benefits another client, such as a client who will testify that he or she 
complained to a defendant that children were in danger but nothing was done. 
Another advantage of representing multiple clients, as opposed to each having separate counsel or 
each filing their own separate lawsuit, is sharing costs. Many costs can be shared, such as court filing 
fees, deposition costs, and travel expenses, while some costs, such as individual psychological 
evaluations or other costs associated with proving individual damages and losses, are not shred. 
Likewise, the prosecution of the case will be more efficient and more consistent if it is not run by a 
group of attorneys each with his or her own client and his or her own strategy. 
It's also possible that clients who the Firm has decided not to represent will hire attorneys who might 
lack our Firm's skill and sophistication, and who could take actions that adversely affect your case, 
the law, and future prospects for recovery. 
OUR REASONS AGAINST REPRESENTING MULTIPLE CLIENTS 
Our greatest concern in representing multiple clients is that a conflict of interest could develop 
between or among our clients. It is impossible to anticipate every potential conflict. The biggest risk 
in multiple client cases is that the defendant might lack the assets or insurance coverage to pay all 
claims in full. If we collect all of that money for one client, then we may have deprived our other 
clients of any chance of being fairly compensated by that defendant. 
It is also possible that a defendant will insist on a common settlement fund which means that it will 
pay a fixed amount to settle all cases. The challenge in that situation is dividing the settlement fund 
among multiple clients. We could not represent any one client against the interests of any other 
client. It would be necessary, therefore, to refer all of our clients to separate attorneys to resolve the 
issue concerning the distribution of the common fund. 
On the other hand, defendants and their insurance companies often insist on a common settlement 
fund because they want to resolve all of their risk at the same time. In turn, they are often willing to 
pay more to resolve all of their risk than if they are only settling some of the claims. 
It is also possible that one client will reveal information that is damaging to another client. In this 
situation, we may no longer be able to represent either client and each client may need to seek 
separate attorneys. 
Finally, you lose some measure of confidentiality when you join forces with another party. Thus, if 
there is a meeting of several clients to discuss joint strategy, no one can prevent one client from 
revealing what was said at the meeting. Even an agreement to keep the content of the meeting 
confidential is difficult to enforce. (Individual attorney-client communications, however, always 
remain strictly confidential.)

Sex Case Victims Lining Up. 
The New York Post -- Page Six 
October 2007 
g, Mon, 15 Oct 2007 at 15:27 * 
October 15, 2007 -- LAWYERS for Manhattan billionaire investor Jeffrey Epstein - who's agreed to plead guilty to soliciting underage hookers -
are bracing for a slew of lawsuits from as many as 40 young women who came to his Palm Beach mansion for massage sessions, Page Six has 
learned. 
During the probe that led to Epstein's plea deal, which will put him behind bars for 18 months, underage girls told cops they claimed to be 18 or 
over and gave the financier massages for hundreds of dollars per session. One g 
"purple vibrator" on her while she partially stripped. Cops say Epstein's assistant, 
court documents as just 14, said Epstein used a 
helped arrange the massages. 
"The lawyers have identified up to 40 women who could come forward, even though some of them didn't even see Epstein - they just 
accompanied their friends and stayed in the kitchen and had lunch," the source said. 
Epstein's legal team is also fighting to get some portions of the police report chronicling the sleazy activities changed. "For example, the state 
police reported finding in Mr. Epstein's garbage a 'sex toy.' 
Meanwhile, the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach last night confirmed a Web site report that Epstein has been banned there. "He would use the 
spa to try to procure girls. But one of them, a masseuse about 18 years old, he tried to get her to do things," a source told us. "Her father found 
out about it and went absolutely ape-[bleep]. Epstein's not allowed back." Epstein denies he is banned from Mar-a-Lago and says, in fact, he was 
recently invited to an event there.

The fee is £120 - you can pay after the session by cash or cheque. I am 
aware that Adam will settle payment for the first consultation, and 
alternate sessions if we agree to work together. 
Please note that the cancellation policy is 48 hours notice for any changes 
to the appointment to avoid being charged the full fee. 
I am attaching a consultation form - it will save time if you can fill it 
out and bring it to our session. I am also attaching our terms and 
conditions for you to read. 
Kind wishes, 
Sheri

Oh, I understand! I thought you were looking to be seen together. 
The other female therapists are booked this week. I am away quite a bit 
over the summer, but if it helps I can see her 2pm Wednesday 2nd July or 
12pm Sat 5th July at Portman Square. I might be able to fit in some 
other sessions with her over the summer before I return fully from 
Summer break in September. 
Let me know if that would be ok for

Sorry, I forgot to mention my attorneys are having difficulty booking my interview with the administrator. I have repeatedly asked my attorneys to book me the next available interview slot, and they 
keep on wanting to book the 30th of October or after or just before the deadline on the 19th of October. 
Please can you help me book an interview, as I need plenty of time to make my Objection before the 19th October deadline? 
Many Thanks

Dear Linda, 
I hope you are well. I am sending you an email before our scheduled conversation later as there are some things I want to say. 
When we first met early in our conversation, you looked at me and said, "I believe you". Those words have profoundly affected my weary soul and given me the courage to fight as hard as I can for

How you can be discriminated against 
Discrimination can come in one of the following forms: 
• direct discrimination - treating someone with a protected characteristic 
less favourably than others 
• indirect discrimination - putting rules or arrangements in place that apply 
to everyone, but that put someone with a protected characteristic at an 
unfair disadvantage 
• harassment - unwanted behaviour linked to a protected characteristic that 
violates someone's dignity or creates an offensive environment for them 
• victimisation - treating someone unfairly because they've complained 
about discrimination or harassment 
It can be lawful to have specific rules or arrangements in place, as long as 
they can be justified.

Overview 
The Equality Act 2010 legally protects people from discrimination in the 
workplace and in wider society. 
It replaced previous anti-discrimination laws with a single Act, making the law 
easier to understand and strengthening protection in some situations. It sets 
out the different ways in which it's unlawful to treat someone. 
Find out more about who is  protected from discrimination, the types of 
discrimination under the law and what action you can take if you feel you've 
been unfairly discriminated against. 
Discrimination: making a complaint 
Before the Act came into force there were several pieces of legislation to 
cover discrimination, including: 
• Sex Discrimination Act 1975 
• Race Relations Act 1976 
• Disability Discrimination Act 1995 
If you wish to complain about possible unlawful treatment there are 2 
separate processes, depending on when it happened. 
Complaints: before October 2010 
If you were subjected to unlawful treatment (eg discrimination, harassment 
or victimisation) before 1 October 2010, the Equality Act won't apply. Instead, 
you'll be covered by the legislation that was in force at the time. 
For example, if you experienced race discrimination on 30 September 2010 
and want to make a complaint or bring legal proceedings, the Race Relations

RELENTLESS PURSUIT: MY FIGHT FOR THE VICTIMS OF JEFFREY EPSTEIN ® 
try to kill him. While I had never heard anyone say that Epstein had this fear, I had 
often wondered how it never happened. He continued to talk in a low voice, primarily 
on the subject of the young females in Epstein's life. He confirmed what many others 
by this point had said—that Epstein's entire life, from the time he woke up to the time 
he went to sleep, revolved around young women. 
As soon as Jeffrey got out of jail in 2008, there were girls at his house all the time 
—the only thing that changed was the target age of his victims. They were all prom-
ised something that Jeffrey would do for them, and at some point, this bodyguard 
expressed his concern to Jeffrey about his misleading them. He said, "You just got out 
of jail, you can't keep doing this with these girls." He made it clear that Epstein was 
engaging in the same conduct that landed him in trouble in the first place but with a 
slightly older age group, focusing his attention not on rounding up high school kids, 
but on the modeling industry as his recruiting playground. 
These were girls who believed they were there—wherever "there" was at any given 
moment—for a legitimate reason, not illicit sex. But Jeffrey's purpose with them was 
sex and only sex. His bodyguard watched as dozens of young aspiring models were 
lured into Epstein's world before being discarded, more broken than before. When 
this bodyguard told Epstein that he shouldn't keep doing this with girls, he said Ep-
stein responded, "Don't act like my grandma or you will be fired." 
Yes, he confirmed that 
tried to swim off the island, but her attempt showed 
no greater level of distress than he'd seen in other girls throughout the years. The rest 
of our meeting had little to do with girls, and much to do with the danger he saw me 
putting myself in with Epstein. He was himself a real-life tough guy, yet I could tell he 
was frightened by Epstein. And he stressed that I should also be frightened. He had 
no precise information; it wasn't as if Epstein had told him I was a target. He simply 
made it clear that I was somebody Epstein had talked about, and not in a friendly way. 
But of course, I already knew that. 
As we got to know each other, he increased the seriousness in his voice. "You don't 
know who you're dealing with. I worked for him for years and I still don't know who 
you're dealing with. He knows everybody who's powerful in this world." He went on 
to explain that Jeff's connections were not just to the local police, who were "definitely 
in his pocket," and from whom "when he was in jail and on house arrest, he got so 
many favors." He elaborated that Epstein "made very clear that the federal govern-
ment would never prosecute him." 
He also snuck stories in to give me examples of how scary Epstein was. On one 
occasion, a lawyer was found at the bottom of a swimming pool. Epstein asked him if 
he thought people would believe it was a suicide, as if it wasn't, and suggested that he,

I will be flying from Cape Town International to New York hopefully on the 27th of Feb. As I do not have a visa yet I will need a return ticket but a 
return to the UK (London). As I am on the visa waver I am only allowd to spend a maximum of 90 days in the US, so with the return ticket if you 
could possibly book the return for +\-87 days after my arrival into the US.Sorry for being so complicated and I really do appreciate your help.

Importance: Normal 
FYI, we engaged Morris yesterday, and he retained counsel. We will likely be conducting a proffer of him in the near 
future. You folks are welcome to toss any questions you would like us to pose to him. 
His attorney is already attempting to devalue his roll, indicating he was just a low level relationship manager, amongst 
many. (Note, he appears to have done very well for himself as a low level relationship manager). 
Secondly, after out attorney's jump through some hoops, we will likely be seeking to interview Epstein's attorney, who was 
responsible for a lot of the transactions, and appears to have made efforts to structure transactions, so as to avoid SAR's 
etc.. As that time come closer, I will reach out to you. 
Finally, as mentioned, to the extent Maxwell changes her tune, and seek to be more cooperative, we would love to have 
you ask some questions for us, regarding her understanding of JE's relationship with Deutsche Bank. 
Many thanks,

Many thanks 
Hope you guys are well. Mr. Epstein is the gift that keeps giving. As noted, we are looking at Deutsche Bank, 
for a number of reasons, with one being that they should not have let Epstein bank with them, in that it was clear 
he was .moving money for the payment of women. They as much admit that, but seem to justify it, in that they 
did not believe the women to be under age (i.e., complete disregard for the trafficking aspect, or witness 
tampering). 
In short, we were wondering who you may have engaged at the bank, and are particularly interested in knowing 
if you spoke with the relationship manager, Paul Morris. 
Many thanks!

Hey M, 
First and foremost I hope you are well. I am reaching out to figure out if the Epstein case was on your squad. 
Jammy and I have an investigation into Deutsche Bank, and one of the aspects of the investigation is transaction 
monitoring, or the lack thereof, and that includes banking Epstein. 
If the case was on your squad, we were wondering who the case agent was, and further if they spoke with 
Epsteins relationship manager at the bank, Paul Morris. 
Thanks!

Mark, 
Thank you for your prompt reply my apologies on my slowness. 
Jumas I met once, in Lord Ahmed's chambers at Israel Shamir's book launch. 
If I recall, he was distressed with the Turkish ambassador's remark that Palestine 
was a swamp. 
Having lived in Turkey, I predicted then that Turkey would not long be an ally of Israel. 
But that was my only contact with Jumas, if you are talking about the MK who 
is in a small party that I think has not presence in the Knesset. Haim Oron. 
The only MK I have been close to lately is Sharon Haskell, the Likud member 
who convinced the Likud to make pot legal. I gave her a copy of one of my books, 
the one that was published in English. Pretty and single and hard to forget. 
One would expect Hank to know him? 
The names I mentioned, Bull and Erben, are relics. I am sure that they played a part 
here, but I was clutching at straws, almost certain you would not have heard of them, but I had to 
try. Bull died in 1990, Erben in 1985. 
You may be correct that I am barking up the wrong tree, to some degree. Any insight you 
might have would be appreciated greatly.

One small suggestion, if you want to limit pesky journalists from your door - go to 
and look at the tenants roster. 8CD has Anderson with Epstein next to it. It would be simple 
to remove your surname and limit the curiosity of the press. 
A green van with NY plates, possibly a Ford, seems to be in your area a lot, I cannot presume it 
is up to anything bad, but what little info I have you are welcome to. 
The person I mentioned on the phone is not the nice person you may think they are, neither is 
their spouse. They are keen on being secure in every way and have no limits to what they would do. 
I do not like either of them. I may be barking up the wrong tree in some ways, and as I said, I welcome and 
corrections,but I do have a good idea of what is going on especially with that couple. 
Best,

I am at a loss to compose this well. But I think you will understand it, and if not please don't hesitate to ask any questions. My eyes 
are shot and I have a strong headache looking at the screen. In other circumstances I would work this out and send you a better 
missive, but I feel you want this sooner rather than later. With that preface, have a read: 
I feel bad about not being able to show you my full hand at the moment. Not to be taken personally, but we were talking on a 
listening device, and listening devices, like walls, have ears. What I am considering to give you some sense of ease is showing up at 
the door of a notary who is also an officer of the court, and who has known me for decades, along with my passport to make a 
sworn statement as to my identity. In our last talk I think you asked for Kevin and/or Calvin. If you know people with these names, 
I do not want to be the cause of any uneasiness between you, so I will, for their sake, tell you that I am neither a Kevin or a Calvin. 
Do not rule out that MK is my real name. A sworn statement from an officer of the court, who happens to be a Orthodox Jew, will 
shine some light upon who I am. 
Without narrowing down my identity too much, I can tel you that I was in US military intel and had a clearance issued to me young, 
when my uncle was in fact head of int'l relations at the Pentagon and answered directly to the president. Other family members 
hold TS + and I might ask one to be a liaison. 
But the point is not who I am. It is your security. Please do not be lulled into a false sense of such because you were left alone to 
parade your car etc in full view. I would ask Ramon to keep the metal gates down at all times in the future. 
When the #1 target was a risk factor to a certain already mentioned person and their allies, you were safe. Until he was out of the 
equation. Now they can work down the list. 
I am not sure if GM is on it or their ally, she thinks she is but allies have ways of falling out. Or falling down dark stairs, despite her 
power. 
I gave you a warning; you might cynically think what I might want in return. It might cross your mind that I work for a security 
firm and want you as a client. I do not, I make no referral that way. There are many which employ the kind of people I did mention. 
Nor do I want $ or access to any assets. 
But I am ready at this time to tell you what I do want, and I would think that there is much symbiosis. Let me back up just a bit and 
say that while Jeffrey would never do anything that he knew would hurt other Jews, he has left lots for anti Jewish conspiracy 
theorists to use. No surprise to you I am sure that many are rushing to say that he, and you and sometimes even all of us are 
Mossad. And I take into account that many of the accusations against him are false, some conflated. His friend Mr Dershowitz has 
already 100% proven them wrong and one accuser a liar. Not to paint Jeffrey as a saint, he ought to have spent more time studying 
Torah than partying in the company of ungodly people. 
His poor choice of companions, and his poor choice of activities, has done harm not only to him, but to all Jews. This is in fact part 
of what some foreign intel agencies want to happen, masking their own presence and making Israel weaker. I complicate this, my 
apologies, but it is a complex equation of using cutouts to do intel work and then 
letting others take the blame. In this case, non Jews used Jeffrey. 
EFTA00037221
--- PAGE 5 ---
My concern is for the Jewish people. 
You are a Jew, I am a Jew. What is to be done to rectify this? 
You have some things here. You have information, which you may not know the value of, 
as far as it shows that neither you nor he are Mossad, or even working knowingly for any 
foreign intel agency. 
But there is the presence of certain parties in this mix who are, including on the Humpty Dumpty charity, which you and he were 
part of, along with 29 Congressmen. On that bipartisan list we find Hank Johnson, who calls Jews termites; already there is 
comment not on anti Jewish conspiracy sites, but among members of the tribe. 
I will not press you for an explanation there. But it is not making the rest of us happy. 
What is your duty to the Jewish community and to your country, America, in light of this? 
Clearly it is to aid in identifying those parties that had access to Jeffrey at certain times. 
Years ago Jeffrey had some exposure to North Korean/Chinese agents, and was in the proximity of arms dealers who sold to these 
nations and on behalf of them. 
Gerald Bull may have been involved, after being stripped of his US citizenship. And possibly Dr Herman Erben. That would have 
bee in Europe, 70s/80s. 
Up to the present, what needs to be known is more about the PRC Chinese execs at Humpty. And anything else you might see or 
recall. 
I appreciate your help, which might be of great use and I would expect that you would not at all go unappreciated for that. 
You can see why I have an interest in your longevity. 120? 
But at least not 65.

Subject: Epstein updates 
All, 
After much engagement with HQ over the past 48 hours, and our efforts to both consolidate and limit the 
reporting requirements, HQ is now requesting updates in a conference call to be held daily at 1530. You should 
all receive the bridge line information tomorrow. Trust me, nothing you're thinking right now hasn't already 
been communicated to the highest levels. IMO, this is largely driven by DOJ. Is it inconvenient? Yes. 
Regardless, we'll need to support the calls because those you all deal with in CID are in the exact same position 
as you. We should support each other and push through. 
Based on all my calls with HQ, here are some of my thoughts on how we should go forward: 
Many questions I'm receiving are driven by media reporting (e.g. Maxwell, NM residence search, etc.). If you 
see sustained reporting on one aspect, get ahead of it. For example...media has been all over the location and 
role of Maxwell as a co-conspirator. I advised that based on the volume and quality of evidence we have, the 
team is currently focused on charges for a different co-conspirator. However, we're engaged with Counsel for all 
co-conspirators. Kill the rumor before it gets legs in the minds of senior leadership. 
With regard to interviews or other investigative techniques, stay general unless we have significant 
information. You could say, "we conducted interviews of 14 MCC Corrections Officers and continued with the 
financial analysis but don't have anything signficant to report." Only give names of an interviewee if there was 
something significant. 
If we don't have significant results to report, it's ok to say so. Be mindful that most, if not all, of what you say 
will be pushed to the seventh floor. 
- Tuesday is a big day with the hearing so be prepared to talk it on Monday and beyond. You can provide 
the approximate number of victims expected to attend and any efforts we have in making that happen 
(coordinating transportation, etc.). On Tuesday you'll give the read out of the hearing. In your reporting over 
the next few days/weeks, stay focused on the investigation of the co-conspirators and stay tight with SDNY on 
conversations they're having with Counsel and the direction we're headed towards charges. 
/
 and on Wednesday 
- I've continually expressed to HQ how C-19 and C-2 are tight on the 
drug/sex case. You guys can speak together about that case. Clearly we're focused on analysis of the phones as 
well as the nature and timing of likely charges. 
- I talked to 
and know that you guys have a couple big interviews to do that will determine if the 
PC case has any legs or if gets shut down. I would focus on advising of the timing of those interviews. 
- I've included you here FYSA. Let me know if you want the bridge line details as well. 
Enjoy your Sunday.

Video Outside Epstein's Cell During First Suicide Attempt "No Longer Exists," Prosecutors Say. 
USA 
Today 
(119, Johnson, 10.31M) reports, "Prosecutors told a federal judge Thursday that prison authorities 
inadvertently deleted surveillance video of the area outside the Manhattan jail cell of accused child sex trafficker 
Jeffrey Epstein during his first suicide attempt." Prosecutors told US District Judge Kenneth Karas "authorities 
had mistakenly preserved video from a different part of the detention facility instead of the area where Epstein 
and Tartaglione were housed in July." According to the article, "the disclosure is likely to revive conspiracy 
EFTA00037230
--- PAGE 2 ---
theories suggesting Epstein was murdered to keep him from discussing his activities with a constellation of 
influential friends." 
CNN 
(119, Simko-Bednarski, Levenson, 83.16M) reports, "Prison officers at the Metropolitan 
Correctional Center (MCC) in New York found Epstein on the floor of his cell in the early-morning hours of July 
23. He was found with a strip of bedsheet around his neck in what a federal document calls an apparent suicide 
attempt." On July 25, "an attorney for Epstein's cellmate at the time asked that MCC preserve video from outside 
the cell, the filing notes. MCC legal counsel looked up the cellmate's cell number in the MCC computer system 
and requested that the staff preserve video of the cell from that night, the filing says," but "the attorney said in 
December that security footage from that night was missing. The government responded a day later, saying the 
video was not missing and that it had been preserved," but "the letter filed Thursday indicated that the video was 
in fact gone due to a mix-up. The MCC computer system had listed an incorrect cell for Epstein's cellmate, and 
so MCC staff had preserved unrelated footage, according to the government's letter." 
The AP (1/9, Mustian, Balsamo) reports from New York, "The FBI also has determined that the footage does not 
exist on the jail's backup v

We spoke with Mark Epstein and were able to get the original emails from him. Bill is analyzing the headers and will 
send an attachment shortly with the analysis results as well as copies of those emails. 
As for the YouTube video, I am doubtful that we will get a copy of this. As I understand it, Mark received an email 
from Jeff that had a YouTube link to a "mock interview" between Jeff and Steve Bannon. Apparently there were 
some comments about Trump and their relationship that Mark thought were of interest. We understand Mark 
received this email from Jeff sometime this year, 3-4 months ago, and viewed it at that time. When he went back a 
couple weeks later to view it, it was no longer available. (Sounds like the YouTube video was taken down whether it

Subject: Jumas/name on roster 
Date: Thu, 15 Aug 2019 20:07:37 +0000 
Mark, 
Thank you for your prompt reply my apologies on my slowness. 
Jumas I met once, in Lord Ahmed's chambers at Israel Shamir's book launch. 
If I recall, he was distressed with the Turkish ambassadors remark that Palestine 
was a swamp. 
Having lived in Turkey, I predicted then that Turkey would not long be an ally of Israel. 
But that was my only contact with Jumas, if you are talking about the MK who 
is in a small party that I think has not presence in the Knesset. Haim Oron. 
The only MK I have been close to lately is Sharon Haskell, the Likud member 
who convinced the Likud to make pot legal. I gave her a copy of one of my books, 
the one that was published in English. Pretty and single and hard to forget. 
One would expect Hank to know him? 
The names I mentioned, Bull and Erben, are relics. I am sure that they played a part 
here, but I was clutching at straws, almost certain you would not have heard of them, but I had to 
try. Bull died in 1990, Erben in 1985. 
You may be correct that I am barking up the wrong tree, to some degree. Any insight you 
might have would be appreciated greatly. 
One small suggestion, if you want to limit pesky journalists from your door - go to 
and look at the tenants roster. 8CD has Anderson with Epstein next to it. It would be simple 
to remove your surname and limit the curiosity of the press. 
A green van with NY plates, possibly a Ford, seems to be in your area a lot, I cannot presume it 
is up to anything bad, but what little info I have you are welcome to. 
The person I mentioned on the phone is not the nice person you may think they are, neither is 
their spouse. They are keen on being secure in every way and have no limits to what they would do. 
I do not like either of them. I may be barking up the wrong tree in some ways, and as I said, I welcome and 
corrections,but I do have a good idea of what is going on especially with that couple. 
Best, 
Melvyn

Mark, 
I am at a loss to compose this well. But I think you will understand it, and if not please don't hesitate to ask any questions. 
My eyes are shot and I have a strong headache looking at the screen. In other circumstances I would work this out and 
send you a better missive, but I feel you want this sooner rather than later. With that preface, have a read: 
I feel bad about not being able to show you my full hand at the moment. Not to be taken personally, but we were talking on 
a listening device, and listening devices, like walls, have ears. What I am considering to give you some sense of ease is 
showing up at the door of a notary who is also an officer of the court, and who has known me for decades, along with my 
passport to make a sworn statement as to my identity. In our last talk I think you asked for Kevin and/or Calvin. If you know 
people with these names, I do not want to be the cause of any uneasiness between you, so I will, for their sake, tell you 
that I am neither a Kevin or a Calvin. Do not rule out that MK is my real name. A sworn statement from an officer of the 
court, who happens to be a Orthodox Jew, will shine some light upon who I am. 
Without narrowing down my identity too much, I can tel you that I was in US military intel and had a clearance issued to me 
young, when my uncle was in fact head of int'l relations at the Pentagon and answered directly to the president. Other 
family members hold TS + and I might ask one to be a liaison. 
But the point is not who I am. It is your security. Please do not be lulled into a false sense of such because you were left 
alone to parade your car etc in full view. I would ask Ramon to keep the metal gates down at all times in the future. 
When the #1 target was a risk factor to a certain already mentioned person and their allies, you were safe. Until he was out 
of the equation. Now they can work down the list. 
I am not sure if GM is on it or their ally, she thinks she is but allies have ways of falling out. Or falling down dark stairs, 
despite her power. 
I gave you a warning; you might cynically think what I might want in return. It might cross your mind that I work for a 
security firm and want you as a client. I do not, I make no referral that way. There are many which employ the kind of 
people I did mention. 
Nor do I want $ or access to any assets. 
But I am ready at this time to tell you what I do want, and I would think that there is much symbiosis. Let me back up just a 
bit and say that while Jeffrey would never do anything that he knew would hurt other Jews, he has left lots for anti Jewish 
conspiracy theorists to use. No surprise to you I am sure that many are rushing to say that he, and you and sometimes 
even all of us are Mossad. And I take into account that many of the accusations against him are false, some conflated. His 
friend Mr Dershowitz has already 100% proven them wrong and one accuser a liar. Not to paint Jeffrey as a saint, he ought 
to have spent more time studying Torah than partying in the company of ungodly people. 
His poor choice of companions, and his poor choice of activities, has done harm not only to him, but to all Jews. This is in 
fact part of what some foreign intel agencies want to happen, masking their own presence and making Israel weaker. I 
complicate this, my apologies, but it is a complex equation of using cutouts to do intel work and then 
letting others take the blame. In this case, non Jews used Jeffrey. 
EFTA00037240
--- PAGE 3 ---
My concern is for the Jewish people. 
You are a Jew, I am a Jew. What is to be done to rectify this? 
You have some things here. You have information, which you may not know the value of, 
as far as it shows that neither you nor he are Mossad, or even working knowingly for any 
foreign intel agency. 
But there is the presence of certain parties in this mix who are, including on the Humpty Dumpty charity, which you and he 
were part of, along with 29 Congressmen. On that bipartisan list we find Hank Johnson, who calls Jews termites; already 
there is comment not on anti Jewish conspiracy sites, but among members of the tribe. 
I will not press you for an explanation there. But it is not making the rest of us happy. 
What is your duty to the Jewish community and to your country, America, in light of this? 
Clearly it is to aid in identifying those parties that had access to Jeffrey at certain times. 
Years ago Jeffrey had some exposure to North Korean/Chinese agents, and was in the proximity of arms dealers who sold 
to these nations and on behalf of them. 
Gerald Bull may have been involved, after being stripped of his US citizenship. And possibly Dr Herman Erben. That would 
have bee in Europe, 70s/80s. 
Up to the present, what needs to be known is more about the PRC Chinese execs at Humpty. And anything else you might 
see or recall. 
I appreciate your help, which might be of great use and I would expect that you would not at all go unappreciated for that. 
You can see why I have an interest in your longevity. 120? 
But at least not 65.

Thank you for your email. 
Things are a bit crazy right now. 
Darren could see you at his office on Monday from 9-11. I know he is

Please let me know if that will work.

Hi 
Hope all is well. 
I'm flying to FL on Saturday and returning Tuesday. It is important that I 
speak to Darren face to face. Something of interest has come up. 
Please tell him to let me know where/when to meet. 
On another note, I will be in Paris from the 25th to 28th. Would it be 
possible to get into Jeffs place there so I can isolate family items, and 
photos that might be there. I don't want to take anything with me but 
would like to have them put aside so they don't disappear or get 
dispersed. Please let me know.

Subject: EPSTEIN Mark / request / file 7083/2117493/Roa 
Good morning 
We received the following request from the cantonal police of Wallis : 
On 02.06.2020, a person called EPSTEIN Mark from New York City contacted the operations centre of the 
cantonal police of Wallis in CH-Sion. 
Later on the same day (at 16:21 hours and 16:24 hours), he sent an email to the said police service. 
He stated that he was the brother of EPSTEIN Jeffrey, a convicted sex offender who committed suicide in 
custody. 
When he was investigating his brother's death, he allegedly came by chance across a conversation between a 
person unknown to him - "Mim Mim" - and a Mister HAUB. 
EPSTEIN Mark also sent a screenshot of the Linkedin profile of "Mim Mim" and a screenshot of two messages 
from "Mim Mim" in which the unknown person threatened EPSTEIN Mark with the death of his children. 
On 04.06.2020, at 13:30 hours, we called EPSTEIN Mark. He told us, that his deceased brother and HAUB Karl 
Erivan were possibly murdered. 
He takes this assumption from the statements of the mail contents sent by the unknown person "Mim Mim". 
HAUB Karl Erivan is missing since 07.04.2018, after a ski tour in the high mountains of CH-Zermatt. 
Up to now, there are no indications that the disappearance of Mr. HAUB in CH-Zermatt, could be due to a 
violent crime. 
The below listed information was taken from the e-mails forwarded to us by EPSTEIN Mark, which were sent 
between 30.05.2020 and 04.06.2020: 
- "Mim Mim" and HAUB Christian (brother of the missing person) allegedly had a conversation. 
- "Mim Mim" claims to have received hush money from BUSS Leander (alleged security officer of Tengelmann). 
- "Mim Mim" allegedly sold documents 
- The disappearance of HAU Karl Erivan and the death of EPSTEIN Jeffrey are allegedly connected. 
Furthermore, EPSTEIN Mark L. stated to have been in contact with the following FBI agent: 
office: 
mobiel: 
EPSTEIN Mark L. is using the following email-accounts and phone number: 
The unknown person "Mim Mim" should be using the below mentioned email-accounts 
Request: 
EFTA00037259
--- PAGE 3 ---
- Are the US authorities aware of any reports from EPSTEIN Mark regarding HAUB Karl Erivan? 
- Do the US authorities have information concerning a possible link between EPSTEIN and HAUB Karl Erivan 
that could be relevant for the investigation of the missing person's case in CH-Zermatt? 
- In regard to the person EPSTEIN Mark, how would you evaluate the information provided by him? 
- any other relevant information

One of my friends is the designer of the IRGC spy software, the same software that managed to hack the CIA

I'm a fact check reporter for The Daily Caller investigating a potentially false claim about the island of Little St. 
James in the U.S. Virgin Islands that has been circulating online. The claim is that the FBI recovered human 
bones in the water near the island, which was previously owned by Jeffrey Epstein. 
Has the FBI found or recovered human remains of any kind on or near the island since Epstein was arrested on 
July 6? 
If you could respond as soon as possible, that would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time.

This morning's press conference took us by surprise -- our supervisors did not say anything to us about it in advance, and 
in particular had no idea that there would be comments about the active investigation. Our understanding now is that the 
event was in connection with Safe Horizon, the victim services organization, and that 
answered at least one 
specific question about the investigation, relating to Prince Andrew. We just heard from 
that he spoke to 
about it (I think earlier today?) so everybody is playing catch up.

Subject: Epstein case 
Due to the high profile nature of Epstein, the fact that EM is engaged at multiple levels, and that we have 
numerous fronts of this investigation, I'd like you to start a SCN and include an updated SCN with your weekly 
sit reps to 
. It should include updates on each of the facets of the investigation: victim interviews, 
digital analysis, financial analysis, forfeiture, public corruption, and significant events (e.g. the search of his 
island). These should detail who and what we're finding. For example, the financial analysis section could 
be..."Financial Analysis: SONY, in collaboration with Squad C-XX (assuming they're working with our FAs) and 
outside vendor XXXXX, are reviewing XXX investment and money market accounts located at XYZ Bank and 
ABC Brokerage Firm. Significant findings include $250,000 payment to XXX and $100,000 payment to XXX on 
XX/XX/XXXX, which coincide with the Miami Herald articles. Additional subpoenas to be served." If we don't 
have anything on the PC side, then just type "Nothing Significant To Report." The key here is that we want to 
make sure 
and 
are comfortable we're tracking all fronts. 
We need a conference call tomorrow. If you haven't talked to M, call him today and let's get it set up. 
Check their availability and socialize CEOS's inclusion. I think their involvement would be good especially 
considering the fact the victim yesterday said JE asked her opinion about putting heads of adult females on 
child bodies and masturbating to the image. That's right up the CP alley and is good for an affidavit. 
You saw my effort on the taint team TDYs. 
is supportive and is checking on bringing people from CEOU. 
The A/SC is briefing the DAD this morning on the case. 
Call me when you get to the office.

Importance: Normal 
I am sure you are familiar with the Epstein case, we recently received the case file from MM. The USAO SDNY is 
requesting the case file be sent to a third party vendor so the documents can be scanned. Apparently this has been done 
numerous times in the past with other FBI files (see below). With a file this size I think their request makes sense as they 
want to have the file in a digital format for scanning, cataloguing, and indexing purposes. Does Miami have any objection 
to us releasing the file in its entirety so SDNY can utilized a vetted third party vendor to scan the files? I have cc'd the NY0 
CDC, 
so she can weigh in on the discussion. 
Thanks,

Sean, 
Thanks very much again for talking with us earlier, and we wanted to get you the example cases as promised—it's a 
number of cases so hopefully that's helpful. I think the ideal would be for the materials to come directly to us so our 
paralegals can manage the process with the vendor (unless the documents are already on their way to the New York field 
office), and then we can send them either to you or back to Florida once they've been scanned. 
The following investigations have been with our office and FBI where we've used outside vendors, including for original 
and highly sensitive documents (such as medical records, personnel records, etc.): 
U.S. v. Chambers, 
U.S. V. Ade!glass,
U.S. V. Ng Lap Sen 
U.S. V. Tortora, or 
U.S. V. Ashrof Has 
U.S. V. Goldbrene 
U.S. V. Vargas, he, 
U.S. V. Krupkin, d 
U.S. V. Cruz, over
In terms of the vendor, we choose from a small number of organizations that work with us regularly, and they keep all the 
information strictly confidential (by contractual requirement, most importantly, though also from a desire to be able to 
EFTA00037279
--- PAGE 2 ---
continue to get work with us). I'm not aware of any instances where that has been a problem. 
Please do let us know if any other info would be helpful, and we're also happy to chat with anybody who wants to talk 
with us about it, and hopefully we can finalize this week.

assaulted and her then-ls-year-old sister molested by Epstein and his companion, Ghislaine Maxwell, in 1996. 
then 26, claims that she was employed by Epstein, a multimillionaire financier who lived in a vast mansion on New York's Upper East Side, 
and that she frequently saw "school-age girls" wearing uniforms come into the mansion and go upstairs. She was told that the girls were auditioning for 
modeling work, according to her affidavit. 
Then an art student in New York,

I am sure you are familiar with the Epstein case, we recently received the case file from MM. The USAO SDNY is 
requesting the case file be sent to a third party vendor so the documents can be scanned. Apparently this has been done 
numerous times in the past with other FBI files (see below). With a file this size I think their request makes sense as they 
want to have the file in a digital format for scanning, cataloguing, and indexing purposes. Does Miami have any objection 
to us releasing the file in its entirety so SDNY can utilized a vetted third party vendor to scan the files? I have cc'd the NY0 
so she can weigh in on the discussion. I would like to have your concurrence before releasing the files 
since they belong to MM.

Thanks very much again for talking with us earlier, and we wanted to get you the example cases as promised—it's a 
number of cases so hopefully that's helpful. I think the ideal would be for the materials to come directly to us so our 
paralegals can manage the process with the vendor (unless the documents are already on their way to the New York field 
office), and then we can send them either to you or back to Florida once they've been scanned. 
The following investigations have been with our office and FBI where we've used outside vendors, including for original 
and highly sensitive documents (such as medical records, personnel records, etc.): 
U.S. v. Chambers 
U.S. V. Adelglass, 
U.S. V. Ng Lap Se 
U.S. V. Tortora, o 
U.S. V. Ashrof Ho 
U.S. V. Goldbrene 
U.S. V. Vargas, he 
U.S. V. Krupkin, d 
U.S. V. Cruz, over 
In terms of the vendor, we choose from a small number of organizations that work with us regularly, and they keep all the 
information strictly confidential (by contractual requirement, most importantly, though also from a desire to be able to 
continue to get work with us). I'm not aware of any instances where that has been a problem. 
Please do let us know if any other info would be helpful, and we're also happy to chat with anybody who wants to talk 
with us about it, and hopefully we can finalize this week. 
thanks again

We had every intention on getting the materials from the ADELGLASS search scanned but we did not. it was a 
lot of back and forth with the SDNY. 
However, we did get the materials from the search of CITY MEDICAL scanned and they were patient medical 
files. SDNY took care of arranging. We did not have any problems at all. After they were scanned, the 
documents were loaded into Relativity and we reviewed them in there. 
Thanks

SDNY is requesting we turn over to them one of our files in its entirety so it can be scanned by a third 
party vendor. The AUSA mentioned that he did this for your case, U.S. vs Adeglass (see below). I was wondering how this 
went, if there were any legal hurdles with the request, any issues I should be aware of before I agree? We've never had a 
request like this but it makes sense due to the enormity of the file. I have been getting pushback from legal regarding 
turning a whole file over to the USAO. Just wanted to get your take on this before committing.

In both NY and FL, from approximately 2002 through 2005, Jeffrey Epstein enticed and recruited dozens of minor girls, ages 14 to 
17, to engage in sex acts with him. Afterwards, Epstein paid the victims hundreds of dollars in cash. Victims were initially 
recruited to perform massages, which would turn sexual in nature. Victims would have to perform the "massages" nude or 
partially nude, and Epstein would masturbate while he asked victims to touch him and touched the victims' genitals with his 
hands and/or sex toys . Epstein encouraged his victims to recruit additional girls, then would pay both the victim and victim-
recruiter in cash. Epstein had employees who would set up the appointments. Victims in New York and Florida usually were 
contacted via telephone by individuals who worked for Epstein to arrange his "massages." 
On July 2, 2019, Epstein was indicted for 18 USC 1591 (a), (b)(2), and (2) and 18 USC 371. The indictment is sealed. An arrest 
warrant has been issued out of SDNY. A search warrant for Epstein's residence at

sworn out the day of arrest.

Thanks for getting back to us. In terms of the current status, I'm a little confused just because a couple weeks ago 
we understood that Florida FBI had located the files, and that in fact they had located them and made them available 
for OPR several weeks ago, and Florida was prepared to send them to our office right away at that time. Our 
understanding was that the materials they had located included the full case file as well as other boxes the case 
team identified when we visited back in January (that were in the possession ofM. 
So I'm not sure what still 
needs to be located? 
And in terms of next steps, our bosses are concerned about not having a plan in place—that is, not having a 
resolution for sure on where the files are going, figuring out what we have in terms of the materials, what will 
happen when they get here, etc. I think we should be able to work that out now? We can tell anyone who needs to 
know what the files consist of since we've reviewed them in-person, and similarly we're happy to talk to whoever we 
need to in order to explain why it would be much easier logistically to have the materials sent to us (or even directly 
to the vendor), or at least to have the vendor plan approved to start immediately when the materials arrive. 
We're totally happy to talk directly to the ASAC and FBI legal, or if it's an issue of seniority we can ask our chiefs or 
the criminal division chief to reach out directly. I apologize if we seem pushy about these docs, but we initially 
requested them in December, so this has been a six-month long process for us and we thought we had finally 
resolved it with the Florida counsel earlier this month—and we're getting incredible pressure from our supervisors to 
have it resolved. 
Please let us know who we should be in touch with (or if someone above our heads should be in touch, who they 
should call)? And thanks again for your help.

On 7/26/2019, Mima Alsharif from CNN contacted NYO regarding reporting from the Miami Herald in which 
stated "she was sexually assaulted and her then-15-year old sister molested by Epstein and his companion, 
Ghislaine Maxwell, in 1996." Alsharif was asking for confirmation of
iclaims that she had 
rar iifted her assault 
to the FBI in 1996. Alsharif noted recently released documents that reference a FBI interview of 
n 2006. NYO 
was aware that

were interviewed by the FBI as part of the MM investigation of 
Epstein. 
On 7/29/2019, NYO OPA informed Alsharif that we couldn't comment due to the ongoing investigation and we have not 
seen any media reporting related to this RFI. 
On 8/16/2019, NYO OPA received a call from a reporter at the NY Times who stated he had been in contact with 
and her attorney, Ingrid McColley (ph) 
. He asked for verification of the alleged notification to 
the FBI in 1996 and stated McColley/ claimed to have called the FBI after Epstein's arrest but hadn't received a 
return call. OPA stated we had a proactive effort to make contact with victims via the FBI hotline and that we've 
contacted everyone who called the FBI hotline. [Note: we have no record of 
or McColley contacting the 
FBI after Epstein's arrest.] 
On 8/16/2019, McColley contacted NYO OPA who then passed the message to me. 
On 8/16/2019, C-20 contacted McColley who stated 
was an em lo ee of Epstein's in the 1990s when she was in 
her 20s. McColley requested any and all documentation regarding 
alleged contact with the FBI in 1996 
as well as her 2006 interview. McColley was informed that any requests for information must be made through a formal 
FOIA request. 
A search of Sentinel met with negative results for any contact with -in 
1996. We do have documentation of 
an interview with 
in November, 2006 as part of the MM Epstein investigation. 
advised that 
in the 1990s, she went to Epstein's ranch in New Mexico where she "cuddled" with Epstein, and Ghislaine Maxwell 
allegedly rubbed her breasts during a massage. 
On 8/16/2019, the NY Times reported advised that they would be publishing their story next week. 
I'm unsure what the NY Times intends to say, but wanted to ensure everyone was aware in case they suggest the FBI 
knew of Epstein's criminal activity as early as 1996.

Just an FYI, as a result of the Epstein arrest and indictment, we will be traveling to Florida to interview 
approximately 25 victims. Most of the victims are in the Miami/West Palm Beach area, however, two victims are 
believed to be in Winter Gardens and Palm Harbor. Just wanted to let you know we will be in your AOR, flying 
down tonight and starting interviews tomorrow. Let me know if you need more information.

Yes, all day Saturday SDNY contacted the victims' attorneys to convey the message that the investigation was 
going to continue and that we would be available to answer and questions or concerns. The case agents reached 
out to the few that aren't represented.

I agree there is probably no need to search the plane but it is possible we may pursue a seizure 
at some point in the future, but we are not there yet.

6. Brief Synopsis of Case : 
In both NY and FL, from approximately 2002 through 2005, Jeffrey Epstein enticed and recruited dozens of minor girls, ages 14 to 
17, to engage in sex acts with him. Afterwards, Epstein paid the victims hundreds of dollars in cash. Victims were initially 
recruited to perform massages, which would turn sexual in nature. Victims would have to perform the "massages" nude or 
partially nude, and Epstein would masturbate while he asked victims to touch him and touched the victims' genitals with his 
hands and/or sex toys . Epstein encouraged his victims to recruit additional girls, then would pay both the victim and victim-
recruiter in cash. Epstein had employees who would set up the appointments. Victims in New York and Florida usually were 
contacted via telephone by individuals who worked for Epstein to arrange his "massages." 
On August 10, 2019, a search warrant for Epstein's private island, Little Saint James located off the coast of St Thomas, U.S. 
Virgin Islands is expected to be sworn out. The warrant will be executed on August 12, 2019.

A team of FBI/NYPD will travel from New York, NY to St Thomas U.S. Virgin Island on Sunday August 11th, 2019. 
On Monday August 12th, FBI/NYPD team will reach Little St James (LSJ) and execute the search warrant. The group will divide 
into four teams and conduct a security sweep of the entire island, making entry into any and all structures. Team 1 will sweep 
ALPHA - Zone 1, Team 2 will sweep BRAVO - Zone 2, Team 3 will sweep CHARLIE- Zone 3, and Team 4 will sweep DELTA - Zone 
(see attached zone descriptions). All individuals encountered on the island will be searched for weapons and once cleared, will 
be brought to a central location (TBD) for interviews. Agents/TFOs will attempt to identify employees on the island to provide 
access to locked structures and containers. In the event a structure or container needs to be accessed the Breech Team will be 
contacted. 
Once all zones are secured search teams lead by FBI ERT will search any and all structures on L.S.I. Teams will then break off to 
conduct any interviews of all persons found on LSJ.

3. 
Conducted Energy Devices (e.g., electronic immobilization, 
control, and restraint devices). 
Ill. 
DOJ officers are authorized to use less-than-lethal devices only in those situations 
where reasonable force, based on the totality of the circumstances at the time of 
the incident, is necessary to effectuate an arrest, obtain lawful compliance from a 
subject, or protect any person from physical harm. Use of less-than-lethal devices 
must cease when it is no longer necessary to achieve the law enforcement 
objective. 
IV. 
DOJ officers are authorized to use only those less-than-lethal devices authorized 
by their component and that they are trained to use, absent exigent circumstances. 
V. 
DOJ officers are not authorized to use less-than-lethal devices if voice commands

danger of death or serious physical injury to the officer or to another person. 
A. Deadly force may not be used solely to prevent the escape of a fleeing suspect. 
B. Firearms may not be fired solely to disable moving vehicles. 
C. If feasible, and if to do so would not increase the danger to the officer or others, a verbal 
warning to submit to the authority of the officer shall be given prior to the use of deadly force. 
D. Warning shots are not permitted. 
E. Officers will be trained in alternative methods and tactics for handling resisting subjects, 
which must be used when the use of deadly force Is not authorized by this policy. 
This policy is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, 
enforceable at law or in equity, against the United States, its departments, agencies, or other 
entities, its officers or employees, or any other person.

FBI DEADLY FORCE POLICY 
Law enforcement officers of the Department of Justice may use deadly force only when necessary, 
that is, when the officer has a reasonable belief that the subject of such force poses an imminent 
danger of death or serious physical injury to the officer or to another person. 
A. Deadly force may not be used solely to prevent the escape of a fleeing suspect. 
B. Firearms may not be fired solely to disable moving vehicles. 
C. If feasible, and if to do so would not increase the danger to the officer or others, a verbal 
warning to submit to the authority of the officer shall be given prior to the use of deadly force. 
D. Warning shots are not permitted. 
E. Officers will be trained in alternative methods and tactics for handling resisting subjects, 
which must be used when the use of deadly force is not authorized by this policy. 
This policy is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, 
enforceable at law or in equity, against the United States, its departments, agencies, or other 
entities, its officers or employees, or any other person.

----------------------------------------
Jeffrey Epstein's conduct became the subject of an investigation by the West Palm Beach Police 
Department, and then the FBI, after the parents of a victim reported to law enforcement that Epstein had 
abused their daughter in 2005. Those investigations spanned approximately two years and included, among 
other things, interviews with approximately 35 victims; a search warrant executed on Epstein's Florida 
residence; and detailed analysis of various phone and flight records. Epstein was offered a non-prosecution 
agreement by the Southern District of Florida. The terms of the 2007 non-prosecution agreement required 
Epstein to plead guilty in Florida state court to soliciting prostitution, which he did in 2008. He was sentenced to 
months in jail, was permitted to serve his sentence in a facility where he was released during the day to work, 
and was released from his sentence after serving approximately 13 months. In December 2018, SDNY 
approached the FBI NY to open an investigation into Epstein regarding his conduct in New York. 
Epstein has had significant connections to New York City for many years. He owns what is 
reportedly the largest private residence in Manhattan, spanning an entire city block, and his professional career 
has been centered in part in New York. He was an investor in a modeling agency based in New York City, and 
during the relevant period spent significant time at his Manhattan mansion. As described by at least one 
individual ("Victim-1") who was victimized and recruited dozens of other minor victims in New York City, Epstein 
victimized approximately dozens of girls in New York, in addition to the dozens of girls he victimized in Florida. 
Epstein knew that Victim-1 was under the age of 18, and he knew the other girls she was bringing were under 
18. In particular, Victim-1 recalls having truthfully told Epstein that she was 14 years old, and recalls Epstein 
being upset if she brought him girls who looked like they were 18 or older. 
Agents and SDNY AUSAs have traveled to Florida on multiple occasions to interview victims. The 
identified victims' ages ranged from approximately 14 to 17, with the majority having been approximately 15 or 
when they were recruited to perform sex acts for and with Epstein. Epstein's conduct included masturbating 
in front of victims; fondling the breasts of victims; placing a vibrator on the genitals of victims; and directly 
touching the genitals of victims. Victims would have to perform these massages nude or partially nude. Victims 
were paid approximately $200 to $300 each time they went to Epstein's residence. Two of the victims ("Victim-
and Victim-3") were interviewed in Florida and both have reported the above listed conduct. Like Victim-1, 
Victim-2 estimated bringing dozens of girls to Epstein. Epstein's conduct reportedly occurred in locations 
including, but not limited to, New York City, Florida, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and New Mexico. 
Victims in New York and Florida usually were contacted via telephone by individuals who worked for 
Epstein to arrange his "massages." In New York, one of those individuals was 
in Florida, the primary 
contact for the girls was 
. Additionally, and in order to maintain a steady stream of underage girls to 
perform sexual acts, Epstein and his co-conspirators also coerced others, including some of his victims, to recruit 
other minor girls to engage in "massages" and sexual conduct with Epstein. The recruiters were paid by Epstein 
and co-conspirators for bringing additional minor girls to Epstein's properties for those purposes. 
Following the filing of the initial indictment charging Epstein, we hope to approach other suspected 
and alleged co-conspirators, and to further develop evidence against such individuals through the overt 
investigation, with the possibility of utilizing certain such individuals as cooperating defendants.

Rough estimate. 3 iPads sent for unlocking. I iPhone sent for unlocking, 1 iMac locked and not able to be 
imaged. 1 external hard drive imaged but encrypted. 2 iMac imaged and processed. 1 iMac imaged and yet to 
be processed. 2 windows boxes imaged and processed, 1 laptop imaged and processed. A bunch of loose 
media ( hard drives, thumb drives, etc) imaged and processed. To date nothing has been reviewed pending a 
taint review. Call me to clarify if necessary. When we get back from the impending search, I can get you a 
better status.

Subject: RE: Next steps 
In connection with the Epstein victim services meetings, could you also let us know the date of the New York meeting, 
assuming it's still the plan to do a meeting in both locations? 
And on the same subject, do you know when notifications are going out about those meetings, and who's coordinating 
that? We'd like to talk to whoever is doing the notices so we can make sure it's clear that there won't be any 
substantive update about the investigation or the status of the case. We won't be attending for that reason, and we 
don't want any victims or their counsel to have the misimpression that this is anything but purely services-related info. 
We'll also circle up internally about whether we could come down that week for interviews, separately—I'll be in 
Nashville from the 15th through the lath for a separate work trip, but will check wit 
i their 
schedules.

Due to the high profile nature of Epstein, the fact that EM is engaged at multiple levels, and that we have 
numerous fronts of this investigation, I'd like you to start a SCN and include an updated SCN with your weekly 
sit reps to 
. It should include updates on each of the facets of the investigation: victim interviews, 
digital analysis, financial analysis, forfeiture, public corruption, and significant events (e.g. the search of his 
island). These should detail who and what we're finding. For example, the financial analysis section could 
be..."Financial Analysis: SDNY, in collaboration with Squad C-XX (assuming they're working with our FAs) and 
outside vendor XXXXX, are reviewing XXX investment and money market accounts located at XYZ Bank and ABC 
Brokerage Firm. Significant findings include $250,000 payment to XXX and $100,000 payment to XXX on 
XX/XX/XXXX, which coincide with the Miami Herald articles. Additional subpoenas to be served." If we don't 
have anything on the PC side, then just type "Nothing Significant To Report." The key here is that we want to 
make sure 
and Mare comfortable we're tracking all fronts. 
We need a conference call tomorrow. If you haven't talked to M, call him today and let's get it set up. Check 
their availability and socialize CEOS's inclusion. I think their involvement would be good especially considering 
the fact the victim yesterday said JE asked her opinion about putting heads of adult females on child bodies and 
masturbating to the image. That's right up the CP alley and is good for an affidavit. 
You saw my effort on the taint team TDYs.

All but one of the co-conspirators has been served. The one is a British citizen and is currently out of pocket. There are 
no significant developments in the case to report other than the planned search warrant in the Virgin Islands. Victim 
and witness interviews are ongoing, CART is processing the digital media seized from his residence which is close to 
being ready for review, and SDNY is working with lawyers on co-conspirator cooperation. 
As for the search operation in the Virgin Islands, see attached tentative travel plans with personnel lists. We are 
sending RDT down tomorrow to begin working on logistics like securing lodging for the entire team, working on 
transportation to and from the airport, coordinating with CBP and the Coast Guard regarding transportation from St. 
Thomas to Epstein's island (Little St. James), etc. Also, securing transportation of vehicles that will be needed to 
conduct the search on the island, as well as food, water, supplies, etc. We are coordinating with SSRAa, 
St. 
Thomas RA (San Juan Division) regarding coordination with those entities above as well as the local authorities. 
We are sending the case agents down to St. Thomas tomorrow to swear out the warrant on Friday, and to have them 
conduct a few key interviews of employees we want with us on the island during the search. If the warrant is signed, 
we plan on having the rest of the team fly down on Sunday 8/11 on the FBI 01400 plane, arriving around 7pm Sunday 
night. We will then execute the warrant at 6am Monday morning. The island is a 70+ acre property with several small 
structures and one large house, we anticipate being able to knock the search out in 1— 3 days, depending on what we 
find. Please let me know if you have any questions.

hi, adrienne said she passed on my email to you. 
we've been trying to track the financial side of Epstein's world for a while. 
while we know your agents search his island home (little st james) on aug. 12, it's never been reported 
whether his business office in St Thomas, in the American Yacht Club was searched 
We have talked to a merchant in the marina/office complex who said he saw federal agents enter and 
search the offices of Southern Trust (Epstein's business) on Aug. 12 as well. 
we are trying to confirm this as it would appear to be a place the FBI would want to search for records, 
especially after we had a chance to review the financials for Southern Trust and Financial Trust this 
earlier company) 
we were also told by another merchant that two weeks before Epstein's arrest, large garbage bags of 
shredded papers were outside the offices of Southern Trust to be thrown out 
EFTA00037409

can you confirm the search for us on Aug. 12 or if that date is error, that the office was search by your 
agents 
thanks

Importance: Normal 
The press conference with SDNY on Monday was hosted by Safe Horizons for the purpose of raising awareness for New 
York State's Child Victims Act. Safe Horizons is a victim services non-profit organization. The press conference had 
nothing to do with the Epstein investigation, and while I have not seen the press conference nor have I read a transcript of 
what was said, I do not believe the case was discussed in any detail with the exception of one remark about Prince 
Andrew. The FBI was not involved in the decision to hold the press conference in front of Epstein's residence and I could 
not comment on why that decision was made. If any of the victims have a concern over things said during the press 
conference

Thanks, 
I understand and have reiterated what 
said to the VS. The victim she is working with stays in contact 
with the victim in Australia. The victim in her AOR wanted to know why the victims weren't notified. Can she reiterate 
response or do you prefer to have something written down that she can read off to the victim. I want to make sure 
this is messaged properly.

Thank you for the update. As I'm sure 
has told you, this was not an Epstein related press conference, nor any type 
of update for the ongoing case. It was exactly what I= had said; a question was asked about Prince Andrew and the US 
Attorney responded. 
FYSA, I have not received any calls/contact from victims or attorneys that have kept in steady contact with us on the New 
York end of things. I'll keep in touch with 
to handle anything that may come this way.

I wanted you to be aware of an email that was inadvertently sent to me; however, I instructed the VS that if she has 
questions/concerns about this IF the victims are still inquiring, it needs to be routed through 
since she is the lead 
VS on this case and 
can discuss it with you two. You need to take no action with this VS at this time, but wanted 
you to be aware.

I think you sent this to me by mistake as you were directing it to the case agent, NM, however, in my previous response 
to you, I directed that you do the following: 
Please see below from the SSA who is responsible for this case: 
I have not seen or heard the contents of the press conference but it is my understanding that it had nothing to do with the 
Epstein case. It was simply a press conference to raise awareness for human trafficking. I can't imagine who thought it 
was a good idea to do it in front of Epsteins house and I think that showed extremely poor judgment. However, I do not 
believe the case was discussed in any detail with the exception of one remark about Prince Andrew I am confident that 
the prosecution team was not aware of this press conference, and was equally as upset as we were. I mentioned the press 
conference to the SAC and the ADIC today and they were not pleased. 
Please let me know if the victims express concerns about not being notified, but don't go seeking their input on this press 
conference. 
I don't want you to add fuel to the fire. If the victims still are inquiring about it, that is a conversation that needs to be had 
with the case agent, but the questions should be coming from VS 
as this is her case.

Wanted to let you know that my victim, 
reached out to me to let me know that she and some 
of the other Epstein victims (who were unspecifed) were extremely upset that they were not notified of the press 
conference. 
She and I communicated a fair bit about it that day and she is fine now, in part, because I told her that I would 
find out what happened and try to remediate the situation so that it didn't happen again. 
I am well aware that the situation was the result of poor judgment and lack of communication on the part of the 
USAO. As such, how would you like me to frame this for the victim(s) that I am getting back to? While 
EFTA00037416

unfortunately we cannot control others' actions (and thus cannot reassure them that this won't happen again) is 
this being addressed by the higher ups??? Like, ffs people 
Frankly, I don't think it inappropriate to let them know where the breakdown occurred and let them know that 
they (or their attorneys) can provide feedback to, and take it up with, 
and his office. 
As the case agent, how would you like me to proceed? 
Many thanks.

Myself and 
are requesting travel to London, accompanied by SDNY AUSA's for the week of March 
16th. We expect to leave on the 17th and return on the 20th. The purpose of this trip is for the 
interview/proffer of a witness/co-conspirator of Jeffrey Epstein's. The time and location for this interview has 
been arranged by the witnesses attorney who has been historically been difficult about changes. Both the 
witness and her attorney reside in London and are not currently willing to travel to the US. This interview 
could prove to be vital to the indictment of another co-conspirator of Jeffrey Epstein which is expected to go 
to grand jury within a few weeks. This person was witness to and potentially participated in the sexual abuse 
of minor victims by Jeffery Epstein and his co-conspirators. For these reasons we request to travel while 
there is a temporary travel restrictions due to the corona virus. Below are the following expected expenses: 
Airfare: $696 x 2 ($1392) 
Hotel: $304 x 2 ($608) 
Parking: $70 x 2 ($140) 
Taxi: $100 x 2 ($200)

Hello there, 
The Marriott and most other hotels are still closed from the storms. The one Marriott on the island is a time share 
and fully booked next week. Sugar Bay has space for all. 
The hotel is open for gov and recovery, etc. The gym, pool, and beach are all open. The restaurant is open for 
supper. We can re-evaluate when we get there. But right now, it's the only thing with gov rate. 
We will re-evaluate our options Friday.

This isn't a call that needs to happen anytime soon, but to have prior to the indictment of Maxwell. 
and 
I spoke yesterday about having a call to touch base about victims and notifications and such. It was pretty

Hi-- 
I was speaking to Mandy earlier and she thought it may be a good idea to have a call soon 
regarding potential case updates; and a discussion on how to handle victim notifications.

Myself ands 
are requesting travel to London, accompanied by SDNY AUSA's for the week of March 
16th. We expect to leave on the 17th and return on the 20th. The purpose of this trip is for the 
interview/proffer of a witness/co-conspirator of Jeffrey Epstein's. The time and location for this interview has 
been arranged by the witnesses attorney who has been historically been difficult about changes. Both the 
witness and her attorney reside in London and are not currently willing to travel to the US. This interview 
could prove to be vital to the indictment of another co-conspirator of Jeffrey Epstein which is expected to go 
to grand jury within a few weeks. This person was witness to and potentially participated in the sexual abuse 
of minor victims by Jeffery Epstein and his co-conspirators. For these reasons we request to travel while 
there is a temporary travel restrictions due to the corona virus. Below are the following expected expenses: 
Airfare: $696 x 2 ($1392) 
Hotel: $304 x 2 ($608) 
Parking: $70 x 2 ($140) 
Taxi: $100 x 2 ($200)

I've attached the request. As I mentioned, I plan to send it over with a very brief cover letter on Tuesday, after 
discussions with the De ut Chief of Mission, the Ambassador (but only if he requests), and the Home Office. 
Also, as I mentioned, 
recommends that there are no public announcements about the delivery of 
the request until after the witness declines a voluntary interview. 
I will follow this up next week with an email explaining the process which usually follows after the Home

oke to 
early May via phone 
about sending the materials to us so we could give them to a vendor, all of which he generally said would be fine and 
asked us to memorialize it in an email to him, which we did more than five weeks ago, on May 7. Sometime after 
that I guess FBI New York prevented them from sending the materials to us, and then another month passed before 
you guys received the materials a week ago. Wanted to correct the

contacted Mabout the materials generally as well).

Thanks for getting back to us. In terms of the current status, I'm a little confused just because a couple weeks ago 
we understood that Florida FBI had located the files, and that in fact they had located them and made them 
available for OPR several weeks ago, and Florida was prepared to send them to our office right away at that time. 
Our understanding was that the materials they had located included the full case file as well as other boxes the 
case team identified when we visited back in January (that were in the possession o 
So I'm not sure 
what still needs to be located? 
And in terms of next steps, our bosses are concerned about not having a plan in place—that is, not having a 
resolution for sure on where the files are going, figuring out what we have in terms of the materials, what will 
happen when they get here, etc. I think we should be able to work that out now? We can tell anyone who needs 
to know what the files consist of since we've reviewed them in-person, and similarly we're happy to talk to 
whoever we need to in order to explain why it would be much easier logistically to have the materials sent to us 
(or even directly to the vendor), or at least to have the vendor plan approved to start immediately when the 
materials arrive. 
We're totally happy to talk directly to the ASAC and FBI legal, or if it's an issue of seniority we can ask our chiefs or 
the criminal division chief to reach out directly. I apologize if we seem pushy about these docs, but we initially 
requested them in December, so this has been a six-month long process for us and we thought we had finally 
resolved it with the Florida counsel earlier this month—and we're getting incredible pressure from our supervisors 
to have it resolved. 
Please let us know who we should be in touch with (or if someone above our heads should be in touch, who they 
should call)? And thanks again for your help.

Thanks very much again for talking with us earlier, and we wanted to get you the example cases as promised—
it's a number of cases so hopefully that's helpful. I think the ideal would be for the materials to come directly 
to us so our paralegals can manage the process with the vendor (unless the documents are already on their way 
to the New York field office), and then we can send them either to you or back to Florida once they've been 
scanned.

desire to be able to continue to get work with us). I'm not aware of any instances where that has been a 
problem. 
Please do let us know if any other info would be helpful, and we're also happy to chat with anybody who wants 
to talk with us about it, and hopefully we can finalize this week. 
thanks again

I hope all is good in NY. 
Please see attached document provided by NCA. Additionally, please advise whether any internal NSPCC investigation 
into Care Iveagh would adversely affect your investigation. 
Also, NCA has some financial intelligence regarding Epstein's 
NCA believes FBINY might 
already be aware of this information as it is a U.S. bank account, but if this would be of interest, NCA can route to you via 
FinCEN. 
Please let us know how we can coordinate with NCA on your behalf.

Wanted to quickly follow up on the below (and attached), and our call last week. From the hard drive you sent 
that contained mostly mixed files, we ultimately were able to identify seven devices that appear to have been 
conveyed in individual folders -- the following NYC numbers: 
NYC024363 
NYC024392 
NYC024328 
NYC024365 
NYC024366 
NYC024371 
NYC024383 
There are two things that are odd about this list, that we need clarification on, please. The first is, on your 
spreadsheet, it says that NYC024392 was not yet ready and hadn't been provided to us. Did we get something 
else under that number, or was the number incorrectly listed on the spreadsheet as incomplete? 
And second, I don't see any listing at all for NYC024328 on the spreadsheet -- I believe the list goes 236, 237, 
239. It's entirely possible I'm just missing it -- please let me know if so -- but if not, did you send us a device that 
wasn't previously identified on the spreadsheet? And if so, are there other devices we should be expecting that 
aren't currently listed? Or was it just a typo? Please let us know as soon as possible, since those seven folders are 
all in the process of being sent to our vendor for processing into platform-readable files and uploading. 
Also, are we still on track to receive all of the devices extracted individually on Wednesday? 
thanks,

get to you. I has to re-process, so I am not sure how long it will be as it is a large item. As far as the stuff I have 
already produced, I can re-work it to split things out, but unsure how much static it will give me. Might be fast, 
might be a pain. Unknown at this point, but I am sure we can get something moving. Any questions, let me

Hey 
I wanted to see if it would be possible to use case funds to purchase a 12TB hard drive to store digital evidence 
on for the Epstein investigation? I think this could solve some of the CART hold ups. Pricing estimate from Best 
Buy is $249.99.

Subject: E stein Claims Fund Program 
To: 
(NY) (FBI)" ca 
Cc: 
The Estate of Jeffrey Epstein has created a Claims Fund Program to compensate the victims of Mr. Epstein. If a victim was 
abused by Mr. Epstein, she is eligible to participate in the Program. Victims are eligible to participate in the Program even 
if their claim is time-barred by the statute of limitations or if they previously entered into a settlement agreement with 
EFTA00037509
--- PAGE 2 ---
Jeffrey Epstein in the past, assuming other criteria is met. There is no cap or limitation on the amount of funds available 
to the Program to compensate all eligible victims. 
This Program is different from the lawsuits that have been filed or could be filed against the Estate. The Program is 
voluntary, which means that each victim has the right to chose whether or not to participate. If the victim has a claim 
that is not barred by the statute of limitations, she can choose to file a lawsuit and litigate her case rather than participate 
in the Program. She can also choose to participate in the Program and litigate her case in Court at the same time. The 
Program and the lawsuit are independent of one another. 
The Program is run by Program Administrator Jordy Feldman. Each victim who chooses to participate in the Program will 
submit her claim (comprised of the details of her abuse and proof of her damages). Ms. Feldman will then make a 
determination as to the monetary value of her claim. Each claim will be evaluated separately, meaning the dollar 
amounts awarded to compensate each victim will differ and are made irrespective of one another. 
Ms. Feldman will run the Program independently from the Estate. This means that the Estate will not be involved in 
determining the amount of compensation awarded to each claimant. Ms. Feldman will make those determinations on her 
own without input from the Estate. The Estate will be provided with the names of the victims who submit claims to the 
Program, but they will not have access to any evidence that each victim submits to support her claim. 
After Ms. Feldman has evaluated a claim, she will issue a letter to the victim or her attorney including the amount of 
compensation that the Program is willing to pay to compensate her. At that time, the victim can either accept the amount 
of money being offered to her and sign a release precluding her from continuing any litigation or taking any further action 
against the Estate, or she can reject the amount of money offered and, if she chooses and the remedy is legally available, 
proceed with/file a lawsuit. 
By way of brief relevant background, the Estate intended to have this Program approved by the Court in the USVI on 
February 4. Shortly prior to the hearing, the Virgin Islands Attorney General filed a lien against the Estate preventing the 
Program from beginning because she did not believe that the tenants of the Program were favorable to the victims. We 
worked together with both the Estate and the USVI AG over the past few months to improve the Program so that the AG 
would allow the Program to move forward. As you know, an agreement has been reached and the Program is moving 
forward. The only reference that was made to the FBI in the Agreement is that Jordy Feldman, as Program Administrator, 
will inform claimants that counseling is available to them through FBI Victim Services or other similar entities, as would be 
available to them whether or not a Program existed. The FBI has not been obligated to do anything outside of the normal 
course of business by way of the Agreement; your tremendous work on behalf of victims has only been highlighted. 
I know that the news articles are often times inaccurate and can be confusing. Please let me know if you have any 
questions or would like clarification on anything.

AG says Epstein lawyers have agreed to revise victim 
compensation fund protocol 
• Jun 1, 2020 
Attorneys for sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's estate and the Virgin Islands government have resolved disputes 
over a proposed victims' compensation fund, and V.I. Attorney General Denise George said she "will allow the 
release of a portion of estate funds for the victims so that the program may proceed." 
George issued the written statement Friday, saying that her office has reached an "agreement in principle" for a 
victim compensation program with the estate's and victims' attorneys. 
The estate proposed the fund in November as a way for Epstein's victims to receive compensation without 
having to go to court, after Epstein died by suicide in a Manhattan jail cell on Aug. 10 while awaiting trial on 
new charges. 
In January, George filed a civil enforcement action under the territory's Criminally Influenced and Corrupt 
Organizations Act against Epstein's estate and six of his companies, claiming that Epstein and his attorneys used 
the Economic Development Commission's tax benefit program to save millions of dollars that helped fund his 
criminal sex trafficking operation. 
As pan of that action, George placed liens on the more than $600 million estate that have restricted his attorneys 
from paying settlements to victims, and argued that the terms of the compensation fund are illegal and help 
protect others who conspired with Epstein to abuse dozens of women over the last two decades. 
V.I. Superior Court Judge Carolyn Hermon-Purcell has said she cannot move forward with probate until George 
and Epstein's attorneys resolved their differences, and George lifts the liens. 
EFTA00037512
--- PAGE 3 ---
George said in the statement Friday that she's now willing to do that, and "the Attorney General's Office, 
working closely with Epstein's victims and their counsel, have now reached an agreement upon the terms of the 
fund, which include a set of reforms that provide a process that will be more fair, credible, and victim-oriented." 
George said she's always supported the existence of such a fund, which "would allow victims to avoid the 
publicity and trauma of a trial and provide them, promptly, with a measure of justice and closure," according to 
the statement. "The victim compensation fund as it stands now, is a substantial improvement from the original 
victims' claim fund proposed by the estate." 
According to George, the victim compensation fund now includes: 
• Involvement of victim advocate Marci Hamilton, CEO of Child USA and the country's preeminent expert and 
advocate on child sexual abuse issues. This will help ensure that the decisions of the fund administrator are fully 
informed by and sensitive to the unique experiences and needs of survivors of trafficking and sexual abuse. 
• Dedicated funding to ensure that victims who have not yet come forward or who are not satisfied with the 
claims process or award can opt-out without sacrificing the chance of a judgment or recovery. 
• Protections to ensure that information shared by victims in the claims process is not provided to the estate and, 
potentially, used against the claimant or other victims. 
• Access to counseling and referral services through the FBI Victim Services program and Child USA. 
• Approval of the program's administrative budget by the Probate Court and monthly reporting to the Attorney 
General's Office and the Probate Court on the number and value of claim awards. 
"The attorney general opposed the estate's initial demand that, in order to obtain funds under the program, 
victims be required to sign broad releases to protect other individuals who sexually abused them. With that broad 
release in place, the Fund could not ensure a fundamentally fair and legally sufficient process for victims who 
choose to participate," according to the statement. "The parties now agree, and the program administrator has 
committed, that no information obtained solely through the program by the estate will be disclosed publicly or 
used by the estate in defending itself from any claim, regardless of forum." 
The estate "has agreed that there is no assertion that the attorney general's release of compensation program 
funds does not act as a waiver of any ability by the government to object to the program's administrative 
expenses, including those paid with these initial funds," according to the statement. 
"I continue to admire the tremendous bravery and strength of the women who have come forward to work with 
my office on this process," George said. "I'm hopeful the agreement will receive final approval, so these women 
are able to receive the help they need. My office will forcefully continue its work to hold accountable Epstein's 
criminal enterprise through the Government's CICO lawsuit and send a clear message that the USVI is not, and 
will not, be a safe haven for sex traffickers or sexual abuse."

Hi 
-
yes this is regarding the civil case. I will forward the information I receive soon as I get it. The civil 
suit has been pressing the estate to let victims be eligible for compensation/ restitution. My understanding is the 
AG in St. Thomas recently ruled in the victims favor. Will let you know soon as I have the specific information.

AG says Epstein lawyers have agreed to revise victim 
compensation fund protocol 
• Jun 1, 2020 
Attorneys for sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's estate and the Virgin Islands government have resolved disputes 
over a proposed victims' compensation fund, and V.I. Attorney General Denise George said she "will allow the 
release of a portion of estate funds for the victims so that the program may proceed." 
George issued the written statement Friday, saying that her office has reached an "agreement in principle" for a 
victim compensation program with the estate's and victims' attorneys. 
The estate proposed the fund in November as a way for Epstein's victims to receive compensation without 
having to go to court, after Epstein died by suicide in a Manhattan jail cell on Aug. 10 while awaiting trial on 
new charges. 
In January, George filed a civil enforcement action under the territory's Criminally Influenced and Corrupt 
Organizations Act against Epstein's estate and six of his companies, claiming that Epstein and his attorneys used 
the Economic Development Commission's tax benefit program to save millions of dollars that helped fund his 
criminal sex trafficking operation. 
As part of that action, George placed liens on the more than $600 million estate that have restricted his attorneys 
from paying settlements to victims, and argued that the terms of the compensation fund are illegal and help 
protect others who conspired with Epstein to abuse dozens of women over the last two decades. 
V.I. Superior Court Judge Carolyn Hermon-Purcell has said she cannot move forward with probate until George 
and Epstein's attorneys resolved their differences, and George lifts the liens. 
George said in the statement Friday that she's now willing to do that, and "the Attorney General's Office, 
working closely with Epstein's victims and their counsel, have now reached an agreement upon the terms of the 
fund, which include a set of reforms that provide a process that will be more fair, credible, and victim-oriented." 
George said she's always supported the existence of such a fund, which "would allow victims to avoid the 
publicity and trauma of a trial and provide them, promptly, with a measure of justice and closure," according to 
EFTA00037527
--- PAGE 3 ---
the statement. "The victim compensation fund as it stands now, is a substantial improvement from the original 
victims' claim fund proposed by the estate." 
According to George, the victim compensation fund now includes: 
• Involvement of victim advocate 
and the country's preeminent expert and 
advocate on child sexual abuse issues. This will help ensure that the decisions of the fund administrator are fully 
informed by and sensitive to the unique experiences and needs of survivors of trafficking and sexual abuse. 
• Dedicated funding to ensure that victims who have not yet come forward or who are not satisfied with the 
claims process or award can opt-out without sacrificing the chance of a judgment or recovery. 
• Protections to ensure that information shared by victims in the claims process is not provided to the estate and, 
potentially, used against the claimant or other victims. 
• Access to counseling and referral services through the FBI Victim Services program and Child USA. 
• Approval of the program's administrative budget by the Probate Court and monthly reporting to the Attorney 
General's Office and the Probate Court on the number and value of claim awards. 
"The attorney general opposed the estate's initial demand that, in order to obtain funds under the program, 
victims be required to sign broad releases to protect other individuals who sexually abused them. With that broad 
release in place, the Fund could not ensure a fundamentally fair and legally sufficient process for victims who 
choose to participate," according to the statement. "The parties now agree, and the program administrator has 
committed, that no information obtained solely through the program by the estate will be disclosed publicly or 
used by the estate in defending itself from any claim, regardless of forum." 
The estate "has agreed that there is no assertion that the attorney general's release of compensation program 
funds does not act as a waiver of any ability by the government to object to the program's administrative 
expenses, including those paid with these initial funds," according to the statement. 
"I continue to admire the tremendous bravery and strength of the women who have come forward to work with 
my office on this process," George said. "I'm hopeful the agreement will receive final approval, so these women 
are able to receive the help they need. My office will forcefully continue its work to hold accountable Epstein's 
criminal enterprise through the Government's CICO lawsuit and send a clear message that the USVI is not, and 
will not, be a safe haven for sex traffickers or sexual abuse."

I hope all is good in NY. 
Please see attached document provided by NCA. Additionally, please advise whether any internal NSPCC investigation 
into Care Iveagh would adversely affect your investigation. 
Also, NCA has some financial intelligence regarding Epstein's 
NCA believes FBINY might 
already be aware of this information as it is a U.S. bank account, but if this would be of interest, NCA can route to you via 
FinCEN. 
Please let us know how we can coordinate with NCA on your behalf. 
Thanks,

After much engagement with HQ over the past 48 hours, and our efforts to both consolidate and limit the 
reporting requirements, HQ is now requesting updates in a conference call to be held daily at 1530. You 
should all receive the bridge line information tomorrow. Trust me, nothing you're thinking right now hasn't 
already been communicated to the highest levels. IMO, this is largely driven by DOI. Is it inconvenient? Yes. 
Regardless, we'll need to support the calls because those you all deal with in CID are in the exact same 
position as you. We should support each other and push through. 
Based on all my calls with HQ, here are some of my thoughts on how we should go forward: 
Many questions I'm receiving are driven by media reporting (e.g. Maxwell, NM residence search, etc.). If you 
see sustained reporting on one aspect, get ahead of it. For example...media has been all over the location 
and role of Maxwell as a co-conspirator. I advised that based on the volume and quality of evidence we have, 
the team is currently focused on charges for a different co-conspirator. However, we're engaged with Counsel 
for all co-conspirators. Kill the rumor before it gets legs in the minds of senior leadership. 
With regard to interviews or other investigative techniques, stay general unless we have significant 
information. You could say, "we conducted interviews of 14 MCC Corrections Officers and continued with the 
financial analysis but don't have anything signficant to report." Only give names of an interviewee if there 
was something significant. 
If we don't have significant results to report, it's ok to say so. Be mindful that most, if not all, of what you say 
will be pushed to the seventh floor. 
- Tuesday is a big day with the hearing so be prepared to talk it on Monday and beyond. You can provide 
the approximate number of victims expected to attend and any efforts we have in making that happen 
(coordinating transportation, etc.). On Tuesday you'll give the read out of the hearing. In your reporting over 
the next few days/weeks, stay focused on the investigation of the co-conspirators and stay tight with SDNY on 
conversations they're having with Counsel and the direction we're headed towards charges. 
and on Wednesday 
- I've continually expressed to HQ how C-19 and C-2 are tight on the 
drug/sex case. You guys can speak together about that case. Clearly we're focused on analysis of the phones 
as well as the nature and timing of likely charges. 
- I talked to 
and know that you guys have a couple big interviews to do that will determine if the 
PC case has any legs or if gets shut down. I would focus on advising of the timing of those interviews.

Number:

Address: 
• 
called on 7/15/19 and she stated she met Epstein through 
at Epstein's residence in NY. 
She was El at the time. Caller said she welcomes a follow up by 
This is the lead information: 
[Caller stated when she was 
went to Epstein's townhouse in Manhattan, NY. Caller's friends, 
had visited Epstein and told Caller about how it was easy money 
Once they walked in, there was a massage 
parlor to the right, and a secretary desk right in front of them. 
went into the massage parlor room, 
where Epstein was already naked with a towel over him. Epstein told them to undress, and they undressed to their bras 
and panties. Epstein, who was facing upwards, advised Caller to straddle him while she was massaging his abdomen. 
Epstein then grabbed Caller by the hips and started moving her in an up and down motion. At this point Epstein's towel 
was off, but Calle rwas still wearing her underwear. 
Caller's and Epstein's genitals were rubbing against each other. Epstein then directed Caller to massage his testicles, while 
simultaneously he had his fingers in 
panties. Caller was unsure if Epstein penetrated 
but he was at the 
very least fondling her. Epstein continued to have Caller go up and down until eventually he ejaculated. Epstein then 
thanked them, he left the room, and Caller and Leann got dressed. When they walked out, the secretary handed them 
each an envelope. Caller believes there was between $250 and $300 in the envelope. Caller remembers the money was in 
big bills. 
Caller stopped speaking with =, 
was never close with 
and is still friends with 
on social media. Caller 
did not know the name of the secretary but described her as being a middle aged Caucasian woman, with glasses and 
brunette hair.] 
Let me know if you need anything else!

Hey guys, 
Just a heads up when your liaison 
runs Maxwell though the TECS system we get a notification 
email that someone at JFK is running her. Just please give us a heads up if your having someone else run her 
name so there's no confusion that she may be leaving the country or there is some other investigation going 
on. Her name has hit 3 times in the past month on TECS. 
Thanks!

No problem, we will start working on what we can today. I've CC'd 
for assistance with some of these 
requests. 
, would you be able to give us a hand with items 2-3 on this list as requested by the AUSA's. I've 
performed an updated Accurint check on Maxwell search for any properties she owns with negative results. 
Hoping maybe you can come up with something in your searches. Thanks!

Subject: GM investigation 
Hi 
and 
In connection with the Maxwell investigation, I know this is a travel week, but if at all possible, are you able to assist with 
the following? It would be great to get some of these in motion this week: 
1) Are you able to spend some time reviewing the message pads seized from Epstein's residence, to search for any 
messages left by (or regarding) any of the individuals relating to the GM case? In particular, it would be helpful to 
know if there are messages relating to: 
2) I recognize that we do not have a complete picture of Maxwell's current finances. I don't think it makes sense to 
request additional financial information, but it would be helpful to have a snapshot of what we already know 
about her current assets. In addition, it would be helpful to know if there are any significant transfers from 
Epstein's account to Maxwell since 2005. Along the same line, a check for more recent alerts in FinCEN would be 
helpful. 
3) On the topic of assets, can you tell us what properties Maxwell currently owns? 
4) Could you please send us the current tracking document for the hotline? It would be helpful for us to check 
through the leads regarding Maxwell. 
5) I think we emailed about this last month, but can you let us know how you know that she has UK and French 
citizenship? 
6) Could you please send us the notes from the 
interview? 
Thanks in advance, and sorry to pile on, I know everyone is busy.

Attachments: Travel_Doc_for Kevin_Maxwell.pdf 
Good afternoon, 
I've attached an inspection record for Kevin Maxwell as reference. His last listed flight (2/29/2020) was 
INBOUND to Boston, however he is listed as not being on board. His last 5 flights have also been listed as not 
being on board. Based on the inspection record being dated on 3/16/2020 it is unclear if he is in the US currently. 
It was noted regarding COVID-19 he has a "travel history with a nexus to Great Britain". The document does not 
specify if he was in the US trying to leave or trying to come to the US again in March. 
Thanks, 
Kimberly

Please call when you get this information. 
I have attached Registration information for N331JE and N722JE. N722JE is the entire aircraft registration file. N331JE is 
just the section that appeared to contain all relevant information to your case. I can give you the entire file if you think 
there is more that might be applicable, and certified copies of the entire files can be obtained if they need to be used in 
court. In my experience, sending the entire aircraft registration file from the start usually is daunting for the investigators, 
and leads to tons of questions just trying to figure out what might be relevant. Sometimes aircraft files are 300 pages or 
more, and that can be frustrating when maybe only 20 were relevant to the SUBJECT. 
I have also attached the LLC Documents for Hyperion Air LLC which is the registered owner for both N331JE and N722JE. 
I have attached the Airman File for the SUBJECT, which is encrypted due to PII. I will send the password in a follow-on e-
mail. I looked at the medical file, but I believe the information contained therein has limited value to your investigation. I 
have created a separate encrypted document with only the information that may be helpful, so that you can evaluate 
potentially relevant information while maintaining medical privacy. If the information in the airman file or the document I 
created turns out to be critical evidence for your case, then certified copies of the airman and/or medical file can be 
obtained at a later date. 
As I mentioned previously, I want to clarify some details regarding the helicopters. What I found appeared to be slightly 
different from what was included in the original e-mail to me below.

I have not yet been able to identify the serial number for N491GM which should lead to the registration documents. If you 
know who the aircraft was sold to, or what registration number it currently uses, I would be able to obtain those 
documents. 
Finally, does this surname have any relevance to your case (potential pilot of one of the aircraft)? VAN HEURCK

: ircra in o 
It was nice talking with you yesterday. Thanks for your assistance with this. Please see the below email of aircraft 
information. 
Below are the aircrafts we believe Maxwell has/had been using. The helicopter we know that she personally piloted, while 
the jets we know her to be a passenger. You'll notice some of the aircrafts will be associated with Jeffrey Epstein, as she 
traveled with him frequently. Any information you are able to provide would be helpful. If there is additional passenger 
manifests for each of these aircrafts we'd like to know that as well. I know we discussed that sometimes that's not 
available. As you can imagine, this case is high profile, so I appreciate any discretion you can make on your part. 
Please let me know if I left something out that would be able to assist you in any way. 
Thanks avain

Hey guys, 
Just a heads up when your liaison 
runs Maxwell though the TECS system we get a notification 
email that someone at JFK is running her. Just please give us a heads up if your having someone else run her 
name so there's no confusion that she may be leaving the country or there is some other investigation going 
on. Her name has hit 3 times in the past month on TECS.

Hi 
and 
In connection with the Maxwell investigation, I know this is a travel week, but if at all possible, are you able to assist with 
the following? It would be great to get some of these in motion this week: 
1) Are you able to spend some time reviewing the message pads seized from Epstein's residence, to search for any 
messages left by (or regarding) any of the individuals relating to the GM case? In particular, it would be helpful to 
know if there are messages relating to: 
2) I recognize that we do not have a complete picture of Maxwell's current finances. I don't think it makes sense to 
request additional financial information, but it would be helpful to have a snapshot of what we already know 
about her current assets. In addition, it would be helpful to know if there are any significant transfers from 
Epstein's account to Maxwell since 2005. Along the same line, a check for more recent alerts in FinCEN would be 
helpful. 
3) On the topic of assets, can you tell us what properties Maxwell currently owns? 
4) Could you please send us the current tracking document for the hotline? It would be helpful for us to check 
through the leads regarding Maxwell. 
5) I think we emailed about this last month, but can you let us know how you know that she has UK and French 
citizenship? 
6) Could you please send us the notes from the 
interview? 
Thanks in advance, and sorry to pile on, I know everyone is busy.

maybe around 3:30 or a little later?

images/videos into the designated folders. In each of these categories, there are multiple devices; please be sure to only 
click on the device you are working on. I have bookmarked folders in different devices to keep the location of items found 
organized by device. I've split up the devices below. This is how they are labeled in the system. Let's keep in touch as you

All, 
Attached please find the review protocol for the image and video files from Epstein's devices. The protocol asks that all 
reviewers read the warrant and supporting affidavit, which are both attached here as well. I am also attaching a copy of 
the Maxwell indictment, which contains a photograph of Epstein and Maxwell.

Once the USAO and FBI review teams are assembled, please let me know when would be a good time for me to have a 
call with them to talk through the review and answer any questions. 
In the first instance, we would ask that the FBI team review the following devices: 
• NYC024363 
• NYC024394 
• NYC024326 
• NYC024368

Depending on how quickly the FBI and USAO teams move through the review, we may reassign some devices between the 
teams. 
Thanks very much

Squad C-20 is requesting assistance from two agents for the Maxwell investigation. They are looking for 2 volunteers to 
help out one day next week, possibly Wednesday or Thursday. They have to show some discovery to Maxwell and her 
defense team at MDC. It is digital evidence so a laptop and hard drive would have to be shown to them at MDC. It could 
potentially be several hours waiting while Maxwell and her team review the materials. Please let me know if you are able

I am following the case against Ghislaine Maxwell with interest. 
I understand that the many 'friends' of Epstein accused of abusing minors in court documents released in the 
Ghislaine Maxwell proceedings will all get an opportunity to defend themselves. In other words deny all 
wrongdoing. 
I do not know if any accusations have been made about Nigel Oakes? He certainly runs in the same circles as 
Trump and enjoys protection from within the Royal family. 
He abused me when I was a child in the UK. In front of my sisters. 
If any young woman have named him directly then I can save them from being accused of lying. Nigel Oakes is 
a pedophile and a particularly bad one from my own experience. 
EFTA00037679

I have tried to ascertain whether Nigel Oakes is on the Lolita Express flight logs but have not been able to 
download this data. 
Rich pedophiles stick together and Nigel Oakes could easily know Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell 
socially and in business.

I keep thinking that someone is going to be contacting me about the Jeff Epstein case, and the connection 
between his case/death and that of Jeanne Palfrey, the DC Madam, and her death, which I also believe was a 
murder, and yet no one is. Maybe what's obvious to me isn't so obvious to other people, so I thought I'd reach 
out to you to make contact now that you've gotten ahold of Ms. Maxwell. Jeanne Palfrey tried desperately 
to get the names of her clients published in her lawsuit because her case was not what it appeared to be. Not 
according to the story she told me anyway as someone who spoke to her almost daily for the last couple of 
years of her life, and up to just a few hours before she was found dead. I believe she was murdered because 
of the great effort many people were putting forth to keep the names in her phone logs quiet, as well as what 
she was trying to say about her case that was being concealed in the media despite all the noise. Because she 
wasn't getting her story told her way, that's why she had plans to publish her own book, her own documentary, 
etc., using money she was supposed to have been awarded by Larry Flynt she was due to receive before she 
was found dead. If her case was suicide, then the things that have been happening to me after her death to 
harass me, and keep me out of the media talking about her story I doubt would have been as aggressive as 
they were. Including the so called fact there was an "investigation" into her murder - when I had texts and 
emails from her again on an almost daily basis for those last few years yet not one detective on her case, nor 
has one single reporter, ever asked me to see any of these nor asked me anything about her side of the story or 
her death despite the fact I was her only best friend, she gave me a copy of her logs, and that I was the only 
one who heard her side of the story before her death. She had been arranging to hold a press conference to 
release names, and also again tell her story about why she was REALLY arrested at the airport as she was 
trying to leave the country, when she was calling me frantic because she was being followed all day the day 
before she was found dead. Her own mother told me she was scared whoever murdered her daughter would 
"come back and shut her up" if she didn't go along with the whole "suicide" cover story, so she begged me to 
keep quiet also about her true feelings. Jeanne was called upon to supply women to the very men over the 
same period of time as this case involving Epstein, and further, she was arrested and murdered during the 
same time period that there were many people trying to keep Epstein from even facing charges. There is a 
LOT of evidence in her phone logs, and that's probably why ABC lied about what was in them until we 
proved they were lying. Even now, most of the names that were in those logs have not come to light. For all 
we know, Ms. Maxwell might have been just as forced to do what she was doing for Epstein and his friends as 
Jeanne was. Jeanne believed Brandy Britton was murdered also to keep her quiet about this same circle of 
men. There is honestly every possibility that Dennis Hof might have even been murdered, as well as Joe 
Conforte. Joe Conforte is missing, which means his body is in pieces somewhere. Joe was in contact with 
just about everyone who was involved in the sex industry there was in the world. So was Dennis. Dennis' 
death also stank to high heaven, especially when you see how his pilot met a strange end just weeks after 
Dennis did. Dennis was being harassed also, and was scared for his life which was why he was hiding out in 
Crystal on his birthday. He had told me he was not getting his voice heard in the media either, just as Jeanne's 
wasn't, and I wasn't, and that's one of the reasons why he ran for office. He felt if he ran for office then the 
major media couldn't shut him up - but then he is found dead practically the day after he wins the election? 
If his death was properly investigated then please answer me as to why Heidi Fliess admitted to giving him an 
edible the night before, yet the sheriff refused to take a sample of that edible when she was there? Why was 
my home attacked just a few weeks after Hors death by four Metro officers without a warrant? I mean they 
spent 90 minutes trying to tear my door off the hinges to get at me without a warrant or probable cause, and 
when a reporter contacted them asking why they were there - they ran. There is a lot more to this story Ms. 
Strauss, and there are answers in Jeanne's phone logs. Hopefully her death will not be in vein if you'll take a 
careful look at those records. I think there was also something in Dennis Hofs records as well worth 
checking out to be honest. Remember, the legal age for sex in Nevada is 16 years of age. Thank you for your 
work on this case.

Hey-
Could you add SOS 
to CART to review JE evidence items. She has been working with us on this case and 
I'd like her to have access to help review items. 
She had prior CAIR access for previous JOCs but she does not believe it's current. Could you help with this? 
Thanks!

Hi everyone, 
Thank you all for your help! Please see below regarding the Image/video file review. Please note that we need to have 
this completed by next Friday. We have ten devices to review at this time. I hope to have each of you set up with access 
to CAIR today and you'll be able to review this from your desk. I will sit down with each of you to help you navigate the 
system and the devices. I've already bookmarked the folders for the devices so all you will have to do is put the 
images/videos into the designated folders. In each of these categories, there are multiple devices; please be sure to only 
click on the device you are working on. I have bookmarked folders in different devices to keep the location of items found 
organized by device. I've split up the devices below. This is how they are labeled in the system. Let's keep in touch as you 
finish each device so we know when each device is complete.

[EXTERNAL EMAIL]  Epstein Image ideo File Review Protocol 
All, 
Attached please find the review protocol for the image and video files from Epstein's devices. The protocol asks that all 
reviewers read the warrant and supporting affidavit, which are both attached here as well. I am also attaching a copy of 
the Maxwell indictment, which contains a photograph of Epstein and Maxwell. 
Once the USAO and FBI review teams are assembled, please let me know when would be a good time for me to have a 
call with them to talk through the review and answer any questions. 
In the first instance, we would ask that the FBI team review the following devices: 
• NYC024363 
• NYC024394 
• NYC024326 
• NYC024368 
• NYC024390 
• NYC024334 
• NYC027910 
• NYC024323 
• NYC024355 
• NYC027908 
Depending on how quickly the FBI and USAO teams move through the review, we may reassign some devices between the 
teams. 
Thanks very much

While there are quite a few account number changes, the production includes three account relationships. Please note 
that despite the fact that the account numbers change, they are in same account. 
1. ELLMAX LLC/GMAXWELL - The last statement for this account is September 2016. 
2. G MAXWELL - This is her current account (last six digits are. 
3. THEODORE W WAITT - Maxwell had a sub account under this relationship. The September 2010 is the last

As requested please see the summary of some of the findings contributing to the likelihood of 
being associated with GHISILAINE. 
Mark — please kindly jump in if you understand any of this to be incorrect of have info to add. 
1. 
of NYO informed me of a social media post generally detailing the concept that 
GHISILAINE's sister, 
formed an LLC with SCOTT BORGERSON. The social media post 
deatiled the fact that GHISLAINE lived with BORGERSON until 2019. The social media post also 
detailed an LLC named "ANGARA, LLC". 
2. 
of NYO also informed me of a significant amount of money (I believe approximately 20 
million dollars) was sent from an account known to be associated with GHISLAINE to an entity called 
"ANGARA", potentailly ANGARA TRUST. 
3. Open source records viewed re ardin 
Bradford NH indicated the owner to 
be GRANITE REALTY LLC of 
Boston, MA 
4. Upon further inspection it was found that the Massachusetts division of cor orations records for 
ANGARA, LLC are associated with an entity located at 
Boston MA and an 
individual named ADAM GHANDER. The entity was also associated with NUTTER, MCLELLEN & FISH 
LLP. 
5. Said social media post also detailed that ADAM GHANDER is the registered owner of TIDEWOOD LLC 
who purchased a mansion in Massachusetts where GHISLAINE had been staying since leaving NY. 
6. Upon further in spection it was found that corporation records associated with TIDEWOOD LLC are 
associated with ADAM GHANDER and 
. The entity was also associated with 
NUTTER, MCLELLEN & FISH LLP. 
7. Open source records confirmed TIDEWOOD LLC was the owner of an address also associated with 
SCOTT BORGERSON. 
It is the aggregate of all of these common entities in corporation filings, fragmented open source reporting 
coupled with known historical telephone communications from GHISILANE to NUTTER, MCCLENNEN & FISH 
LLP that contribute to the high likelihood that 
is affiliated with GHISILAINE.

To Whom it May Concern: 
We are in receipt of Amazon's responses to the attached grand jury subpoena (the "Subpoena"), which were submitted 
several weeks past the return due date. 
We note with concern that the Subpoena responses list more than 300 descriptions of responsive materials as 
"REDACTED." Please immediately produce either a complete response to the Subpoena without the redaction of non-
privileged responsive materials, or provide a legal basis for your refusal to do so, so that we may seek court intervention 
as necessary. 
We further note that Amazon has explicitly reserved objections including that the information and/or records requested 
are unusually voluminous in nature and that compliance would cause an undue burden for Amazon. Please advise 
immediately whether Amazon is in fact exercising any of these objections in its response to this Subpoena specifically; 
that is, whether Amazon has failed to produce responsive materials based on volume or burden. Please also advise 
whether Amazon has refused to provide any responsive materials for any reason, other than the "REDACTED" materials as 
described above. 
Finally, we note that the Subpoena requested any and all records associated with nine email addresses, and the response 
appears to include materials in connection with just two email addresses. Please confirm that Amazon comprehensively 
reviewed its records for each of the other seven email accounts and found no responsive materials. Similarly, the 
Subpoena requested account notes and logs, including any customer service communications or other correspondence. 
No such records were produced. Please confirm that Amazon comprehensively reviewed its records for any such 
materials and that none were found. 
If it is useful to discuss these issues via phone, I can be reached at 212-637-2415 and my colleague Alison Moe can be 
reached at 212-637-2225. IF YOU CALL AND LEAVE A MESSAGE PLEASE PROVIDE A RETURN PHONE NUMBER AT WHICH 
WE MAY REACH YOU. 
thank you,

Subject: overdue subpoena compliance: Amazon Ref. No. CRIM1031692 2019 DS 
Good afternoon, 
Amazon's response to the attached grand jury subpoena is overdue by several weeks. The FBI has emailed and left 
messages with your legal department several times over the past weeks without a response. 
Please respond promptly to resolve Amazon's non-compliance. Otherwise we will initiate contempt proceedings 
regarding your failure to comply with valid legal process. 
Sincerely, 
EFTA00037712

Hi M, 
As per our telephone conversation earlier, I can confirm that I made contact with 
via her mobile on Friday 
16th August 2019. At that time, she confirmed that she was willing to cooperate in the capacity as a witness but she 
wanted to know if a lawyer could be provided and if a list of questions could be made available in advance. 
I then received two emails from 
on Friday 16th August 2019; in the first email she asked if it would be possible for 
her to have a senior community support officer with her at the proposed meeting with the FBI. In the second email 
stated that she did not need a lawyer. She explained that she got very uncomfortable as she has never been part 
of an investigation before and this case has been very ugly. She just wants to assist to the best of her abilities. If there 
would be a lawyer in the room, then that would be great and if not, then she was fine with that too. 
Today, Monday 19th August 2019 I received a telephone call from 
via her mobile. She advised me that she was 
no longer willing to assist the FBI for a number of reasons; Jeffrey Epstein is dead, she has to think about her own 
safety, there is no added value for the FBI speaking to her and she has concerns over confidentiality, fearing that her 
name will land up on Twitter, like others involved.

Contact has been made and is amenable to be interviewed. However, she asked for three things, two of which require 
your input, the third related to location of the proposed interview and the MET has offered their space to which she was 
agreeable. Her questions are as follows: 
1. Will an attorney be provided for her as she doesn't have the finances to hire her own 
2. Can she have a list of questions beforehand 
Let me know your thoughts on how you want to proceed.

I could not pull the 1998 Deed on line, but clearly, L.S.J LLC (Grantor) first received the title on 04/27/1998.

Hi 
If you look at the Quitclaim Deed dated 12/23/2011, see the below paragraph. The "Grantor" in 2011 is L.S.J 
LLC (Epstein). 
I could not pull the 1998 Deed on line, but clearly, L.S.J LLC (Grantor) first received the title on 04/27/1998. 
Being rho• same premises conveyed to Grantor by Warranty Deed dated April 27, 1998 and recorded 
May IS, 1998 in Book 49 
Page 494 Doc. No. 1988 and entered in \tax 52, Page 141 in ihe Office

This is interesting. The mansion was the home of a school until Leslie Wexner bought it in 1989 — at least according to a 
number of public reports. He remodeled it, and it was featured (as Wexner's house) in Architectural Digest in 1995. As 
of 1996, Epstein told the New York Times that the house was his. 
But it doesn't look like there's any record of the property changing ownership between 1989 and 2012, and the sale in 
1989 is to "Nine East 71st Street Corporation." Then 13 years later, that corporation, with Epstein as the president, 
transfers title to another Epstein entity. So did he own it that entire time, rather than Wexner, as had been 
advertised?? Or did Wexner own it through a corporation for which Epstein was the president until 2012? 
Can we pull the equivalent documents to these for the 1989 title transfer?

Hi 
I have a question about the locations where the assaults occurred. 
Did any assaults happen on Great St Jim , aka "Great St James Island"? 
This island was acquired on January 18th and January 21st, 2016, in two separate deeds by "Great St Jim LLC", 
which I believe is an Epstein entity.

Hey all, 
I wanted to send a follow-up email about the device review. See below on who is covering what device. Happy to talk 
through and sit down with those of you I haven't. Everyone should be set up by end of day today to have access to the 
case. The AUSAs have asked that you read through the attachments to be familiar with it. They would also like to set up a 
call sometime later today to touch base with all of you about the review. Is there a time everyone could get on a call, 
maybe around 3:30 or a little later? 
Let me know.

Hi everyone, 
Thank you all for your help! Please see below regarding the Image/video file review. Please note that we need to have 
this completed by next Friday. We have ten devices to review at this time. I hope to have each of you set up with access 
to CAIR today and you'll be able to review this from your desk. I will sit down with each of you to help you navigate the 
system and the devices. I've already bookmarked the folders for the devices so all you will have to do is put the 
images/videos into the designated folders. In each of these categories, there are multiple devices; please be sure to only 
click on the device you are working on. I have bookmarked folders in different devices to keep the location of items found 
organized by device. I've split up the devices below. This is how they are labeled in the system. Let's keep in touch as you 
finish each device so we know when each device is complete.

Attached please find the review protocol for the image and video files from Epstein's devices. The protocol asks that all 
reviewers read the warrant and supporting affidavit, which are both attached here as well. I am also attaching a copy of 
the Maxwell indictment, which contains a photograph of Epstein and Maxwell. 
Once the USAO and FBI review teams are assembled, please let me know when would be a good time for me to have a 
call with them to talk through the review and answer any questions. 
In the first instance, we would ask that the FBI team review the following devices: 
• NYC024363 
• NYC024394 
• NYC024326 
• NYC024368 
• NYC024390 
• NYC024334 
• NYC027910 
• NYC024323 
• NYC024355 
• NYC027908 
Depending on how quickly the FBI and USAO teams move through the review, we may reassign some devices between the 
teams. 
Thanks very much,

None of the 911 calls were relevant. But here are some additional reports I pulled from that DAS search. 
One contains information for an employee of 9 E 71 Street and the second is the property manager of the 
location.

Much appreciated. Two quick questions: 
1) Are you able to pull the supporting sprint reports for the 911 calls reported in the DAS report, or do we need to 
subpoena NYPD communications? 
2) Are you able to run a DAS search with Epstein's phone number (212-533-3739) as well? Thanks. 
Thanks!

It looks like the subscriber records for the 
number start in November 2005, and the messages we looked at 
with the 
number are from October 2005. Looking at the

Could you please let me know who the service provider was in 10105? Thanks.

Hi 
Hope you're doing well. In connection with the Epstein investigation, we were wondering if you could possibly 
send us the search warrant affidavit and order for the Epstein residence. We understand that it was executed by 
local authorities before the case was brought to the FBI, but we understand you have a copy in the files, and we 
can't seem to locate it in the materials we've reviewed. If you could please email it to us, that would be a big 
help. 
Thanks in advance for your help, we really appreciate it.

----------------------------------------
SITUATION 
• 
It is anticipated that on July 2, 2019, Jeffrey Epstein will be indicted on two counts of 18 USC 1591, Sex 
Trafficking of Children and Conspiracy to engage in human trafficking. 
• 
In conjunction with the arrest of Epstein, a lis pendens will be filed on Epstein's Manhattan residence 
(reportedly the largest private residence in Manhattan, spanning an entire city block) as the initial step 
toward seizure. 
BACKGROUND 
• 
In 2005, the West Palm Beach Police Department, and then the FBI, initiated an investigation of Jeffrey 
Epstein after parents of a victim reported to law enforcement that Epstein had abused their daughter 
between 2002 and 2005. Those investigations spanned approximately two years and included, among 
other things, interviews with approximately 35 victims; a search warrant executed on Epstein's Florida 
residence; and detailed analysis of various phone and flight records. 
• 
In 2007, after attorneys representing Epstein met with Alex Acosta, United States Attorney for the 
Southern District of Florida, Epstein was offered a non-prosecution agreement which required Epstein to 
plead guilty in Florida state court to soliciting prostitution, which he did in 2008. He was sentenced to 
months in jail, was permitted to serve his sentence in a facility where he was released during the day 
to work, and was released from his sentence after serving approximately 13 months. 
• 
This non-prosecution agreement garnered significant media attention as Alex Acosta is currently serving 
as Secretary of Labor and the investigation was raised during his US Senate confirmation hearing. 
• 
In December 2018, SDNY approached the FBI NY to open an investigation into Epstein regarding his 
conduct in New York. 
• 
Epstein has had significant connections to New York City for many years. In addition to his residence, 
Epstein's professional career has been centered in part in New York. He was an investor in a modeling 
agency based in New York City, and during the relevant period spent significant time at his Manhattan 
mansion. As described by at least one individual (' 
), who was victimized and recruited dozens 
of other minor victims in New York City, Epstein reportedly victimized dozens of girls in New York, in 
addition to the dozens of girls he victimized in Florida. Epstein knew that 
was under the age of 
18, and he knew the other girls she was bringing were under 18. In particular, 
recalls having 
truthfully told Epstein that she was 14 years old, and recalls Epstein being upset if she brought him girls 
who looked like they were 18 or older. 
• 
Agents and SDNY AUSAs have traveled to Florida on multiple occasions to interview victims. The 
identified victims' ages ranged from approximately 14 to 17, with the majority having been 
approximately 15 or 16 when they were recruited to perform sex acts for and with Epstein. Epstein's 
conduct included masturbating in front of victims; fondling the breasts of victims; placing a vibrator on 
the genitals of victims; and directly touching the genitals of victims. Victims would have to perform 
these massages nude or partially nude. Victims were paid approximately $200 to $300 each time they 
went to Epstein's residence. Two of the victims ("MI 
and n 
were interviewed in Florida 
and both have reported the above listed conduct. Like 
estimated bringing dozens of 
girls to Epstein. Epstein's conduct reportedly occurred in locations including, but not limited to, New 
York City, Florida, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and New Mexico. 
• 
Victims in New York and Florida usually were contacted via telephone by individuals who worked for 
Epstein to arrange his "massages." In New York, one of those individuals was-; 
in Florida, the 
primary contact for the girls was 
. Additionally, and in order to maintain a steady stream of 
underage girls to perform sexual acts, Epstein and his co-conspirators also coerced others, including

--- PAGE 2 ---
some of his victims, to recruit other minor girls to engage in "massages" and sexual conduct with 
Epstein. The recruiters were paid by Epstein and co-conspirators for bringing additional minor girls to 
Epstein's properties for those purposes. 
STRATEGY 
• 
The NYO is coordinating a robust plan to interview a significant number of co-conspirators and victims in 
the hours/days following the arrest of Epstein. 
• 
Efforts are ongoing toward the seizure of Epstein's residences in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Florida 
(total value of approximately $100M). 
• 
SDNY and NYO will coordinate a press conference during which a tip line will be announced to 
encourage other victims to report their encounters with Epstein. 
• 
NYO will coordinate with VSD regarding the victim interviews.

This was from a while back, but wanted to follow up on the question of physical evidence. I've reviewed the list (I thought 
it was really difficult to read, so I reformatted it significantly, though without any substantive changes — see attached) and 
I think the answer is we should have everything transferred up here with the exception of extremely large items. 
Specifically, I think at this stage we do not need to be housing the following: 
1B2 — 31: Green massage table 
182 —43: Peach massage table 
181 —6: Beige massage table 
181 — 7: Brown massage table 
Also, for some of the entries there are numbers next to the descriptions in parentheses. For most of those, it looks like 
either the number of the type of thing or just a repeat of the sub-number of the various item numbers in the first 
column. For item number 1B2, a bunch of the entries have numbers (following the descriptions) that don't seem to be 
either of those things. Is there any significance to those numbers?? I just want to make sure there are no issues with our 
records of what exists. 
Let us know if any questions or issues — and obviously anybody please say the word if you disagree about holding off on 
bringing up the massage tables — and thanks.

I just heard that N212JE was owned by Jeffrey Epstein and is in a hangar at the Cobb County airport 
(KRYY) in Kennesaw, Georgia. 
Flight plans indicate N212JE operated on July 07, 2019 from Paris, France to Teterboro, NJ then on July 11, 
2019 it operated from 
Teterboro, NJ to Brunswick, GA (KBQK). 
It would not be unusual for this aircraft to have operated from Brunswick to Kennesaw without a flight plan. 
I attached the pertinent aircraft registration records for N212JE. 
The aircraft has been registered since March 2017 to; 
Plan D LLC 
St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Island 
The registrant was Lawrence VISOSKI, he signed as Manager 
I believe he is Lawrence Paul VISOSKI Jr. 
he is a pilot 
phone: 
I don't see EPSTEIN name on any of the paperwork. 
There is open source reporting that VISOSKI was a pilot for EPSTEIN. 
I also attached a picture of N212JE.

Hey Guys, 
Not sure if any of the information I have can be of use but I wanted to pass it along in the event that it could be. 
— SIT — worked on JEs property for a week and her Fiancé just recently quit. 
Stated 
a female named '=" 
knows all JEs secrets. JE also gave his pilots apartments on STT (Location unknown) 
but near the airport under one of his companies' names. 
works for Air Traffic Control in 
. Worked as ATC for STT from about March 2018 —April 
2019. Stated she has seen JE with underage girls getting off his jet and then flying them via his helicopter 
to his island during time frame she worked there. 
Maybe she saw other people? 
ATC on STT — stated similar things as 
above. 
EFTA00037809
--- PAGE 2 ---
can find you more people who used to / still work on the island. Remember that these people all signed 
the 1 million dollar Non-disclosure agreement (NDA) and prior to JEs death were petrified to talk with us. Maybe 
that has changed. 
Again, I was investigating his international travel. The responses from other countries stated he was traveling with 
people on his jet but I did not receive their identities. We had the MLAT requests ready to send this week but then 
Saturday happened. On March 22, 2019 Austria did confirm that JE landed with 3 females, had coffee at The Coffee 
House Landmann, then got back on his Jet and left. It is possible to get the identities of these people through the 
MUT request. If you want any of the other countries, let me know and I can send you the dates and places. 
Any questions give me a shout.

As you know the USMS investigates 18 USC 2250 charges in conjunction with the states/territories and 
tribes. We are completely reliant on the states/territories/tribes being compliant with sex offender registration 
requirements under the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA). To my knowledge the USMS has 
not been with the territorial authorities when/if they have conducted compliance checks on EPSTEIN. To better 
answer the question I will have the District's Sex Offender Investigator

Dear 
and 
I am a DCI in the Met Police in London, and have been given your contact details by DCI 
who I 
understand did some work with you back in 2021 in relation to the cases against Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine 
Maxwell. 
As you may be aware, there has been significant media reporting in the UK about (former) Prince Andrew and 
his activities both with 
and efforts he has allegedly made to get information about her through 
his protection officers. 
The UK media also appear to be in possession of certain material from the Oversight Committee, including flight 
manifests from when JE arrived in the UK with other passengers and further allegations around trafficking etc. 
I am reviewing these allegations, and wanted to enquire if you still had any active investigations in relation to 
this matter, and if your team had any involvement in the Oversight Committee hearings and any material being 
presented there. 
If it would be beneficial to arrange a meeting please let me know, or alternatively if you are no longer involved 
with this case, I would be grateful of any contact details you have for anyone currently involved in the matter. 
Kind Regards

Great. Thank you! We don't need to record them. It will be my partner and I, along with 2 AUSAs, so if the soft room 
will fit all of us that will work. We've been able to coordinate availability with the victims and it would be 10am on 
Wednesday and 9am to 4pm on Thursday. 
Thanks again,

Hi 
We can accommodate that. When you write your concurrence to travel EC, just send in the lead that you request the 
assistance of LA for meeting room space. Do you need to record these interviews? We have a soft room here that you can 
use that has recording equipment or we can find you a conference room if you prefer. Are the interviews already pre-
arranged for a set time so we can block off the rooms for you? We can arrange for you to get access to the building too so 
you won't have to be escorted. 
Let us know what you need. 
Thanks,

Hi 
My partner and I are traveling to California next week to interview victims for the Epstein investigation. I was hoping to 
ask for your assistance in using a conference room or soft room or interview room to conduct these interviews on 
Wednesday 9/18 and Thursday 9/19. I briefly spoke with Al and he said that you were the person to coordinate with. 
Would that be possible to have an available room? 
Thanks for your help with this.

I just heard that N212JE was owned by Jeffrey Epstein and is in a hangar at the Cobb County airport (KRYY) 
in Kennesaw, Georgia. 
Flight plans indicate N2 I2JE operated on July 07, 2019 from Paris, France to Teterboro, NJ then on July I1, 
2019 it operated from 
Teterboro, NJ to Brunswick, GA (KBQK). 
It would not be unusual for this aircraft to have operated from Brunswick to Kennesaw without a flight plan.

I appreciate the heads up brother. I'll make sure this gets forwarded on to the case agents. Interestingly enough, I 
remember that plane from when I was in San Juan division and use to see it on the signature ramp at St Thomas when 
we would fly over. One of the agents pointed it out to me as belonging to Epstein, back then.

I just heard that N212JE was owned by Jeffrey Epstein and is in a hangar at the Cobb County airport (KRYY) 
in Kennesaw, Georgia. 
Flight plans indicate N212JE operated on July 07, 2019 from Paris, France to Teterboro, NJ then on July 11, 
2019 it operated from 
Teterboro, NJ to Brunswick, GA (KBQK). 
EFTA00037864
--- PAGE 2 ---
It would not be unusual for this aircraft to have operated from Brunswick to Kennesaw without a flight plan. 
I attached the pertinent aircraft registration records for N212JE. 
The aircraft has been registered since March 2017 to; 
Plan D LLC 
St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Island 
The registrant was Lawrence VISOSKI, he signed as Manager 
I believe he is Lawrence Paul VISOSKI Jr. 
he is a pilot 
phone: 
I don't see EPSTEIN name on any of the paperwork. 
There is open source reporting that VISOSKI was a pilot for EPSTEIN. 
I also attached a picture of N212JE.

indictment. At the hearing, Counsel for the Government and for the deceased Defendant, 
Jeffrey Epstein, will be heard. Counsel for the victims and the victims will also be heard, if they 
wish to be. The hearing will be held in Courtroom 17B. (Signed by Judge Richard M. Berman

Hi all, 
Thanks for volunteering to help tomorrow. As of right now, if people could be on standby around 9:30/10 to help 
with victims. Some victims will be meeting at SDNY before the hearing so we may need some help corralling 
them and getting them to the courthouse without the press. I'd say for now to hang around 290 and I should have 
a better idea in the morning. 
Also, I'm sorry to ask, but please be in a suit tomorrow. This is coming from the higher ups.

Thanks for your follow up. 
This is a video of one of the buildings that was posted to You Tube by somebody named Rusty Shackleford (file 
purports to be taken 7/7, but in any event it was posted to You Tube on July 17, 2019) @ 1:50 et seq. you can 
clearly see a computer on one of the tables

--- PAGE 2 ---
Here's another video of the same room taken by drone, and posted to YT (file purports to be dated 8/3, but in 
any event it was uploaded to You Tube on August 6). @ 1:03... same room, but no computer 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxOFa2EupB8
Both videos were taken and posted prior to the publicized raid on the island on 8/13/19. 
So unless you guys can account for the movement of the computer, somebody not in law enforcement moved 
it. Obviously this raises questions of conspiracy and obstruction at a minimum. 
I want the investigation aware of this information that is in the public domain, and that is widely discussed 
among people skeptical of the Epstein prosecution and suicide.

survivors. Since launching our PSA campaign in Times Square last week to highlight the beginning of the one 
year "window" on August 14th that allows older survivors of childhood sexual abuse to file retrospective civil 
lawsuits, we have seen a spike in interest and energy around the issue. Our plan is to channel that energy and 
also reach more survivors and family members who might be looking for community and resources. The 
march will take place on Saturday, September 28th (we are still finalizing the start time for the march) and will 
proceed up Fifth Avenue from St. Patrick's Cathedral (between 50th & 51st street) to Jeffrey Epstein's former 
home on E. 77th Street. 
Please let me know if you and/or colleagues are interested in joining us on Sept. 28th. It would be great if you 
could also spread the word about the event with your supporters. 
Thanks so much, and please let me know if you have any questions or would like more information about the 
Child Victims Act, the look-back window, or anything else. You can reach me at 
kpjsafehorizon.org
With best wishes,

I appreciate the heads up brother. I'll make sure this gets forwarded on to the case agents. Interestingly enough, I 
remember that plane from when I was in San Juan division and use to see it on the signature ramp at St Thomas when 
we would fly over. One of the agents pointed it out to me as belonging to Epstein, back then.

I just heard that N212JE was owned by Jeffrey Epstein and is in a hangar at the Cobb County airport (KRYY) in

Flight plans indicate N212JE operated on July 07, 2019 from Paris, France to Teterboro, NJ then on July 11, 2019 it 
operated from 
Teterboro, NJ to Brunswick, GA (KBQK). 
It would not be unusual for this aircraft to have operated from Brunswick to Kennesaw without a flight plan. 
I attached the pertinent aircraft registration records for N212JE. 
The aircraft has been registered since March 2017 to;

• Note: the following information is necessary to evaluate human trafficking situations for 
potential rescue- which is part of our primary mission at Hope.for.Justice. We do not 
attempt to work cases that do not fit the Human Trafficking criteria of compelling someone 
to work; or, to engage in a commercial sex act through force, fraud or coercion. We work 
cases and turn them over to law enforcement and to prosecuting attorneys after we have 
gathered enough evidence to justify an arrest of the trafficker. Evidence is key, without 
corroboration of statements, cases cannot be prosecuted. 
Preliminary Questions: 
1. 
This question should be answered in detail by you: Were you trafficked by fraud, 
force, or coercion? Please explain in detail how the trafficking began and ended. 
Please take your time and answer using dates, places, others involved to the best of 
your recollection. If you cannot recall or do not wish to provide further, simply state 
this in the narrative. Provide any photos, emails, texts, or other digital information 
which involves your case.

have sex with them and any other people that they sold me to. The rape and sex

the time. I was taken to an underground location. I was blindfolded so I would not 
know exactly where I was at. It was dark, and when we went through doors. We went 
downstairs, there was also an elevator in the location. I was kept in a stall, it looked 
like a horse stall that had short walls on the sides so you could see inside. It wasn't 
really to keep me and the other little girls inside it was to make it where we could be 
viewed. Epstein would walk past each girl including myself with a lot of men following 
him, and they would judge us. He told me I was "fat and ugly". So that's what he 
called me. 
, and he said ► had to pretend it was 
him to see if I performed well. He said if I performed well I could be his girlfriend, then 
I would be allowed to be upstairs he called it. He said the girls upstairs were pretty 
and they were his girlfriends. He then raped me, and said ► was evil because I liked it. I 
couldn't make my body stop feeling, so he said I had to go to the holding place to pray 
hard enough to be able to be upstairs with the other girls. There were a lot of pictures 
of girls naked all over the walls. I had to pray hard to be like them he said. The girls 
that he said performed well enough, went with the line of all of the men and they left.

I have this sheet that I gave to M, maybe this helps? It's tough to help as I don't have access to look at the 
items till tomorrow AM. Just remember, some items had multiple hard drives in them, so some items might 
map back to the same 1B.

I attached the sheet that 
went over with you with CART numbers. I can't match up all the numbers with I B numbers-
some of the cart numbers for the island I don't even have so I'm not sure where the mix up is. Are you able to identify what 
items these are? Any info would be helpful.

Hey • 
Are you in the office today? I wanted to check in about the message pad scans; I know that they are rather large. 
I want to get them down drafted and on a disc or hard drive to get over to the AUSA's office before we proffer a 
witness next week. 
Also, do you have an estimate of the entire size of all that you scanned so I have a better idea of what device 
SDNY will need to store everything? 
Can you email me or give me a call
when you have a chance. 
Thanks,

That's not a problem at all! I'm glad that they would like to meet with us. We would be happy to sit down with 
them. We've already set aside those days in case we had people who wanted to talk with us. 
It would also be great to set up a time to discuss with you just a little bit of their background prior to going in to

Mr. 
Attached is a letter from Department of Justice Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) Director 
transmitting to you, for a sensitivity review, OPR's draft report in the Southern District of Florida's handling of the Jeffrey 
Epstein matter during 2006-2008. We've found that the draft report is too large to email, so will set it separately in two 
parts. We ask that it be treated with confidentiality. The letter is self-explanatory, but please do not hesitate to let us 
know if you have any questions.

6. Brief Synopsis of Case : 
In both NY and FL, from approximately 2002 through 2005, Jeffrey Epstein enticed and recruited dozens of minor girls, ages 14 to 
17, to engage in sex acts with him. Afterwards, Epstein paid the victims hundreds of dollars in cash. Victims were initially 
recruited to perform massages, which would turn sexual in nature. Victims would have to perform the "massages" nude or 
partially nude, and Epstein would masturbate while he asked victims to touch him and touched the victims' genitals with his 
hands and/or sex toys . Epstein encouraged his victims to recruit additional girls, then would pay both the victim and victim-
recruiter in cash. Epstein had employees who would set up the appointments. Victims in New York and Florida usually were 
contacted via telephone by individuals who worked for Epstein to arrange his "massages." 
4. Date Prepared : 
17/2/2019 
On July 2, 2019, Epstein was indicted for 18 USC 1591 (a), (b)(2), and (2) and 18 USC 371. An arrest warrant has been issued

Subject: Re: Epstein / Maxwell Case... 
Hello again, 
I just wanted to reach out to see if I should still expect someone to contact me. I know it's only been a few days 
since you've last contacted me but I've started to have second thoughts and I'm getting paranoid about my 
safety. Im sure it's just in my head but I've been targeted by him in the past so it wouldn't be that far fetched. I 
know he's dead but i didn't realize how far stretching this was until after I reached out. I just don't want to 
chicken out. 
I've seen on tv that others have come forward and I know the attorneys are busy. So I'm not even sure if they'll 
want to speak with me or they have gathered enough from the others. As I mentioned, this whole thing gives 
me a paralyzing amount of anxiety and fear... so I figured I'd email you to see if you can provide me with more 
information. 
If they don't plan on contacting me, I can go back to pretending this all never happened. If they do, lye thought 
about it and I'm willing to speak with them using whatever communication method is the safest. 
Thanks,

Subject: Epstein / Maxwell Case... 
> 
Hello, 
I've debated whether to send this email a thousand times. In fact, I've written it numerous times. Hopefully I 
will be brave enough to send it this time. 
My name is 
I was sexually assaulted when I was barely 18 years old in a NYC 
restaurant / club. At the time, I was too scared and confused and... well traumatized to do anything about it. 
EFTA00037995
--- PAGE 3 ---
My life pretty much crumbled after that. And by the time I pulled myself together, it was too late to do 
anything about it... Or at least I felt it was. I had done such a good job, eradicating anything associated with 
that part of my life and scrubbing my mind of the memories that I no longer remembered the details like the 
name of the girl that invited me along and introduced me to the person who assaulted me as well as the name 
or location of the venue. So I did nothing... 
A few months ago, I saw Epstein's face on the news and I put everything altogether... I was sexually 
assaulted by Jeffery Epstein. 
He's dead now... so I'm not really sure why I'm emailing or even bringing it up now but I just felt like I 
should let someone know. If I can be of help in anyway, I'd like to be. However, I don't really have proof 
and I can't really offer anything as far as Maxwell's case goes. She could have been there as well as I do 
remember there being a "woman" there along with numerous other "girls". I remember making a mental note 
to myself how it was weird that there that I was probably the oldest one out of the girls that were there except 
for the one woman that was sitting with the other men. 
Anyway, for now, I'd prefer to talk via email but if it makes sense, I'd be okay chatting with you in the future 
if you think it makes sense. Again, I'm not sure if I can be of any help or if it even makes sense to reach out 
anymore... but I just felt like I'd never forgive myself if I stayed silent again this time. 
Thank you. 
Sincerely, 
EFTA00037996

I received a call from the marshals this morning regarding the personal property that was transported with Maxwell, 
which includes her clothes, jewelry, credit card, and phone. We are releasing these items to defense counsel. However, 
Maxwell was also transported with security footage from the local jail where she was held, and the marshals would like 
someone to pick it up, because BOP will not keep it. Could you please pick this up from the marshals at 500 Pearl, and 
keep it in your files? If you have any questions, please feel free to call the marshal I spoke with

Hey= 
I wanted to reach out about traveling internationally. 
and I, along with 2 AUSAs from SDNY were hoping to travel to 
back in March to interview an important witness in the Epstein/Maxwell investigation, but due to Covid that was 
not possible. We spoke with her briefly today via video and she is not comfortable talking at length unless it is in person. 
What is the possibility of getting approval to travel within the next month or so? Separately, I understand we would also 
have to get IOD approval? 
Happy to chat via phone too if you have time.

Squad C-20 is requesting assistance from two agents for the Maxwell investigation. They are looking for 2 volunteers to 
help out one day next week, possibly Wednesday or Thursday. They have to show some discovery to Maxwell and her 
defense team at MDC. It is digital evidence so a laptop and hard drive would have to be shown to them at MDC. It could 
potentially be several hours waiting while Maxwell and her team review the materials. Please let me know if you are able 
to assist

a fast growing number of men in a slow rebellion revoluti0n 
whom are fed up with the perfect young gid without the brains 
and experience that prefer the older women. whom are much 
more fun to be around. not so boring as their younger sisters 
and are more healthy conscious and looking after themselves. 
better company and influence for what a man's aging bodies 
need. Great! I have something to look (onward to. I am 
appalled that it is the magazine editors. and moguls. such as 
an example represented by meryf sheep in The Devil Wears 
Prada, and the ekes of Anna Wintour, Emanuele All whom 
are much older themselves. although fearfully good at their 
jobs and brilliant but cannot have the power to put fourth their 
vision because she dreads that the men financing everything 
will make her loose her job and replace her to someone who 
wdl jump at their request Hence wo still live in a man's world. 
Anyway, back to the dream job that could have launched the 
beginning of a career f0r me. I was with Ford models. I was 
sent to a casting in NowYork, but organized through someone 
from my agency in Milano. I was to see the man who owned 
and was the financier of Victoria's Secret, La Senza. Pink, etc. 
of the Limited brands. Bost mato with the CEO and founder, 
Mr 
I was met by a very sweet and kind Ghislaine Maxwell, that I 
later came to know was the daughter of the mysteriously 
deceased media titan, whom looked al my photo portofolio 
and confirmed the casting with the LTD people. 
I saw two people and the meeting wont very well. 
Subsequently I came back to 
where season in 
was about to start and awaited me. I was chosen 
to be the next Victoria Secret model. I was 0own back to New 
York. no strings attached and put in my very own apartment 
fa a few days in Manhattan and flown on a private jet to Palm 
Beach whom I was going to meet the photographer.

I was told that I had a better body than the top models already 
in the campaign, that they had cellulite and drooping breasts. 
w.de hips. etc. that I, at least wouldn't have to be airboushed 
and photoshopped as much and would be better for the 
catwalks as one of the angels. Also. I got involved with 
intellectual conversations with the man in charge and he was 
very impressed, asking me why would I want to do modeling 
after he saw my art and dancing and that he mvrcy,c.; 
people, why didnt I come live in N.V. and study at Julliard' 
Anyway. Just before the models arrived. I was made an 
advance/ a pass. I. being very naive. didnt know how those 
industries worked. and reacted very badly and offended and 
because I didn't return the sudden 'affection'. the very next 
day I was on a flight back to 
That incident put me oft the modeling world and the whoSe 
entertainment industry so badly, that I stopped modeimg for 
two years. In my prime. (however I have been told I look 
better now than then, and am known as 'the body in the South 
african mode: ing industry). It reassured what I had heard and 
feared 
I thought I could not tell my story to anyone. Who would 
believe me? That is until a few years later I heard of a 
documentary about a BBC reporter that went undercover as a 
top photographer to Milano and exposed the industry there. 
How much abuse of power goes on. 
I am not saying that every top or super model had to go 
through sleeping with someone to get that job. But it does 
leave me wondering what most had to do to reach where they 
are now. 
And as for the man who recruited Victoria Secret models. has 
'scanty been exposed and jailed for sleeping with under aged 
girls and is dragging prince Andrew's name down with him.

I hope that is helpful and helps establish more of the horrid sex trafficking map Maxwell and Epstein 
established.

Hi all, 
We received a hit notification that our sub will be landing at Teterboro at 1720 tomorrow, 7/6/2019. I've attached a copy 
of the arrest warrant. Identifiers are below. 
Sub: Jeffrey Epstein 
DOB: 1/20/1953 
Tail 11: N212JE 
Thank you for your assistance with this. Please let me know if there is anything else you'd need. We'd like to plan to meet 
at Teterboro around 3:30pm to be there early in case of an earlier landing. 
Thanks again,

Good morning all, 
Please let me know as soon as you're aware of his pending arrival/departure from Teterboro. In dealing with 
private/charter aircraft notifications, our systems don't always identify a specific subject correctly.

Hey 
and 
Allow me to electronically introduce you to 
of FBI-NY (contact info below). Please see her below 
email. If this turns out to be an International flight, as is anticipated, this will technically be an arrest made by 
CBP, who will TOT FBI, and your role will largely be to coordinate and facilitate. 
Thanks in advance, 
P.S. I have also taking the liberty of cc'ing CBP TFO 
who is assigned to our VCMO squad. 
whatever assistance you can land is greatly appreciated, as always.

Hi MI 
It was good to chat with you on the phone. Just wanted to give you a quick overview. We are looking to indict our 
subject possibly tomorrow. He has his own plane and is a frequent flier out of Teterboro. Ideally we would like to pick 
him up when he arrives. We usually will get approximately 24 hours' notice when he flies back into the country. In the 
event that happens, I just want to do whatever coordination necessary to ensure his arrest goes as smooth as possible. We 
have his identifiers to include tail number. Please let me know what information you will need and I'm happy to provide 
it. 
Thanks for your help!

<my:Synopsis_of_Case>In both NY and FL, from approximately 2002 
through 2005, Jeffrey Epstein enticed and recruited dozens of minor girls, 
ages 14 to 17, to engage in sex acts with him. Afterwards, Epstein paid the 
victims hundreds of dollars in cash. Victims were initially recruited to 
perform massages, which would turn sexual in nature. Victims would have to 
perform the "massages" nude or partially nude, and Epstein would masturbate 
while he asked victims to touch him and touched the victims' genitals with 
his hands and/or sex toys . Epstein encouraged his victims to recruit 
additional girls, then would pay both the victim and victim-recruiter in 
cash. Epstein had employees who would set up the appointments. Victims in 
New York and Florida usually were contacted via telephone by individuals who 
worked for Epstein to arrange his "massages." 
On July 2, 2019, Epstein was indicted for 18 USC 1591 (a), (b)(2), and (2) 
and 18 USC 371. The indictment is sealed. An arrest warrant has been issued 
out of SDNY. A search warrant for Epstein's residence at 9 East 71st Street, 
New York, New York will be sworn out the day of arrest. </-

FBI DEADLY FORCE POLICY 
Law enforcement officers of the Department of Justice may use deadly force only when necessary, 
that is, when the officer has a reasonable belief that the subject of such force poses an imminent 
danger of death or serious physical injury to the officer or to another person. 
A. Deadly force may not be used solely to prevent the escape of a fleeing suspect. 
B. Firearms may not be fired solely to disable moving vehicles. 
C. If feasible, and if to do so would not increase the danger to the officer or others, a verbal 
warning to submit to the authority of the officer shall be given prior to the use of deadly force. 
D. Warning shots are not permitted. 
E. Officers will be trained in alternative methods and tactics for handling resisting subjects, 
which must be used when the use of deadly force is not authorized by this policy. 
This policy is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, 
enforceable at law or in equity, against the United States, its departments, agencies, or other 
entities, its officers or employees, or any other person.

6. Brief Synopsis of Case : 
In both NY and FL, from approximately 2002 through 2005, Jeffrey Epstein enticed and recruited dozens of minor girls, ages 14 to 
17, to engage in sex acts with him. Afterwards, Epstein paid the victims hundreds of dollars in cash. Victims were initially 
recruited to perform massages, which would turn sexual in nature. Victims would have to perform the "massages" nude or 
partially nude, and Epstein would masturbate while he asked victims to touch him and touched the victims' genitals with his 
hands and/or sex toys . Epstein encouraged his victims to recruit additional girls, then would pay both the victim and victim-
recruiter in cash. Epstein had employees who would set up the appointments. Victims in New York and Florida usually were 
contacted via telephone by individuals who worked for Epstein to arrange his "massages." 
On July 2, 2019, Epstein was indicted for 18 USC 1591 (a), (b)(2), and (2) and 18 USC 371. The indictment is sealed. An arrest 
warrant has been issued out of SDNY. A search warrant for Epstein's residence at 9 East 71st Street, New York, New York will be 
sworn out the day of arrest.

Epstein is presently out of the country. A silent hit notification with CBP has been put into effect for his return to the US. 
Epstein's expected return to the US is unknown at this time. Hit notifications are received approximately 12 to 24 hours in 
advance. In the event that Epstein returns to Teterboro Airport, CBP will detain him at the airport. Agents and NYPD detectives 
will coordinate with FBI Newark and CBP, then respond to effect the arrest of Epstein. 
Once Epstein is in custody, a search warrant for his premises in New York will be sworn out. Agents and NYPD detectives will 
knock and announce their presence at the subject premises. Upon entry, the subject premises will be secured and the search 
warrant will be executed. Teams will then break off to conduct interviews.

The attached are voicemails our office has received regarding Epstein. There are actually a few that I think merit a call 
back and might be of investigative value. Would you please handle, or pass along to whoever has been handling the FBI 
tip line? 
Thanks,

Yes it's the data we received from the carriers. I'll take a look when we receive it from our evidence unit. I don't really 
have control over the format, but I'll take a look before sending over to you.

I think those were GPS data for Maxwell's phone, is that right? If so, the blu-rays had the data in a format 
I'd never seen before, so not sure if there's a different format you can use.

Hey

Just FYI, regarding those blu rays that were not working, we are having new copies pulled and made for you. It should 
take a day or two. I'll let you know when they are complete.

Good morning,

I hope you are both well! I'm following up on 
message below. We are still having difficulty viewing the files on 
Blu-Ray discs 102, 103, and 104. I'd really appreciate it if you would be able to connect me with whomever prepared those 
Blu-Ray discs for us, so we can figure out the best way to access them.

Just looping you in - 
thinks that these files can't really be opened. Instead, the name of each zip file seems to point 
to a specific location hit, and what's inside each zip file seems to be the metadata of that hit. 
Do you happen to know the agent who provided these files? It might be best for us to reach out to them directly to 
confirm this, and possibly have them compile the data in a spreadsheet (or something like that) instead of thousands of 
individual zip files. 
Thanks so much!

I've never heard of this type of file and the internet points to something about 5G cellular networks. These may be some 
type of system file in a cellular network and not meant to be opened. I'll have to research more.

and I are having difficulty figuring out how to open these files below ( 
thinks they're GPS data for 
a cell phone). It looks like the files that should open are .3GPP1IRI files, but I'm not sure how to best view them. 
suggested Quick Time Plus, and while it did open the file, it showed only a single line of text. I'm not sure if that's the 
correct application for viewing GPS files such as these. Would you be able to point us to a specific app or converter we 
should use for this? 
Thanks so much for your help! We really appreciate it.

Sorry for all the emails. I think I figured out what these are — I'm pretty sure they are GPS data for Maxwell's cellphone. 
Would one of you please be able to figure that out? Once that's confirmed, the Blu-Ray folders 102, 103, and 104 can all

< 
Yesterday Capucci reposted the Epstein interview I did from May: 
In May, Prof Alan Dershowitz told me that he was calling on Harvard to further investigate him, so that he would be 
exonerated completely of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein. In a follow-up to the letter to President Bacow at 
Harvard, I asked his office recently whether they have any status update on that investigation Prof Dershowitz mentioned 
to me. It's a good question. 
You may have seen that Scott Bergerson (Ghislaine Maxwell's reputed husband) resigned from his tech startup. That leads 
me to believe the Maxwell deposition is likely to be unsealed. It will be interesting to see what's in there--among other 
things, perhaps more insight into the activities of various faculty members and administrators at MIT and Harvard. We'll 
see. 
If you wouldn't mind, do tell any of your colleagues who may be interested in the interview about it.

All, 
Attached please find the review protocol for the image and video files from Epstein's devices. The protocol asks that all 
reviewers read the warrant and supporting affidavit, which are both attached here as well. I am also attaching a copy of 
the Maxwell indictment, which contains a photograph of Epstein and Maxwell. 
Once the USAO and FBI review teams are assembled, please let me know when would be a good time for me to have a 
call with them to talk through the review and answer any questions. 
In the first instance, we would ask that the FBI team review the following devices: 
• NYC024363 
• NYC024394 
• NYC024326 
• NYC024368 
• NYC024390 
• NYC024334 
• NYC027910 
• NYC024323 
• NYC024355 
• NYC027908 
Depending on how quickly the FBI and USAO teams move through the review, we may reassign some devices between the 
teams. 
Thanks very much,

If you look at the Quitclaim Deed dated 12/23/2011, see the below paragraph. The "Grantor" in 2011 is L.S.J 
LLC (Epstein). 
I could not pull the 1998 Deed on line, but clearly, L.S.J LLC (Grantor) first received the title on 04/27/1998.

Did any assaults happen on Great St Jim , aka "Great St James Island"? 
This island was acquired on January 18th and January 21st, 2016, in two separate deeds by "Great St Jim 
LLC", which I believe is an Epstein entity.

Hope you're well and had a nice weekend! I am writing to confirm which devices had responsive materials (and how many 
responsive materials were on each device) for the Maxwell photo/video responsiveness review. 
The drive which you gave me on Friday contains five folders, one for each of the following devices (NYC024323, 
NYC024326, NYC024355, NYC024368, NYC027910), each of which contains confidential material. Can you please let us 
know how many highly confidential images and video files were identified for these devices? 
Additionally, can you please let us know whether the following devices (NYC024334, NYC027908, NYC024394) had any 
responsive material on them or not? These are devices that were initially assigned to the FBI to review but were not 
included on the hard drive given to us on Friday. If these devices do have responsive confidential material on them, we 
need to get that material from you ASAP, please. 
Finally, the device highlighted below (NYC024363) is the one we spoke about last week which you said would not be ready 
on Friday to provide us with the responsive materials. Please let us know when this is done and how we can best get 
these materials from you. 
In sum, we need you to please confirm the contents of all of the cells below marked with an "x" at your earliest 
convenience. Let us know if you have any questions.

Subject: [EXTERNAL EMAIL] - outstanding discovery issues 
ands ,
Following up on my conversation with 
this morning about several discovery items that are outstanding, I wanted 
to send I list of the outstanding items for discovery. I know you're aware of these and working on them, but I wanted to 
make it easier for us all to keep track of what's outstanding. If you could please send us an email at the end of today 
letting us know where we are on these, it would be extremely helpful: 
1. Locating six images of child pornography in the Florida boxes. Located. They're black and white scans of images. 
2. Putting us in touch with I contact at FBI who can help us discuss converting the grand jury audio to I readable 
format. Another agent will be looking at this tomorrow 
3. Putting us in touch with I contact at FBI who can help us discuss getting I version of the GPS/1D data from 
Maxwell's phone in I readable format. The data we have is unreadable. I figured out the problem. You received 
the raw data which is why it is unreadable. My apologies. I'll have the viewable data tomorrow for you. It is the 
IP data from the pen. 
4. Putting us in touch with the agents who are conducting the responsiveness review of the images, so that we can 
have I brief call with them to discuss the protocol. 
5. Doing I final sweep of media in the files, so we can make absolutely sure we've reviewed everything. I'm going 
through the boxes/files to find any additional media. 
When we talk at 3 today, please let us know if you have any questions about these items, happy to discuss. 
Thanks,

A few small follow-up items: 
• 
For the trip to =, 
I'm going to confirm our meeting with 
at 9:30 on October 11th in =, 
but 
let me know before I do if there are any issues with that timing. 
That should be fine for me. She is the only interview? I just need to get back to NYC that night; so 9:30 
interview should be good. 
• 
For the photo(s) of
hat were seized during search warrants, could you please pull them from evidence to 
check if there are dates on the photos? 
Yes we can pull them. May take a few days to pull out of storage. Will let you know. 
• 
I think you mentioned an analyst was looking at flight records. If it would be possible to get a summary analysis of 
Maxwell's flights, as well as 
(noting any overlap), that would be great. If possible, it would be great to 
have a rough summary sometime in the next week or so, but let us know what timeline is feasible. 
I've asked 
to help with this. We will take a look at this and see the overlap. Keep in mind this is 
only international flights. Manifests that we may have from the previous case for Epstein's flights may not 
go back to the 90's. Make take a few days to pull; but we will let you know when we have it. 
• 
On VNS stuff, could you please double check that 
are all in VNS? 
They should all be in minus
, but I will double check on all to make sure. 
• 
FYI, we've reached out to 
who told us he would send us the emails 
mentioned. We'll pass 
those along when we get them. 
That's great. Thank you. 
• 
We'll add you to the calendar invitation for the meeting with 
attorney, whenever that is rescheduled. Our 
meeting with 
attorneys is scheduled for October 8111 at 10 a.m., and you're welcome to join us for 
that. 
Thank you; that would be great. I'd be interested in hearing what they have to say. 
Thanks!

In addition to the information requested below, I have questions regarding a few particular files that I was unable to open

number of highly confidential files and how we can get the responsive materials from the remaining devices that the FBI 
was assigned to review-- NYCO24334, NYCO27908, NYCO24394, NYCO24363).

Hope you're well and had a nice weekend! I am writing to confirm which devices had responsive materials (and how many 
responsive materials were on each device) for the Maxwell photo/video responsiveness review. 
The drive which you gave me on Friday contains five folders, one for each of the following devices (NYCO24323, 
NYCO24326, NYCO24355, NYCO24368, NYCO27910), each of which contains confidential material. Can you please let us 
know how many highly confidential images and video files were identified for these devices? 
Additionally, can you please let us know whether the following devices (NYCO24334, NYCO27908, NYCO24394) had any 
responsive material on them or not? These are devices that were initially assigned to the FBI to review but were not 
included on the hard drive given to us on Friday. If these devices do have responsive confidential material on them, we 
need to get that material from you ASAP, please. 
Finally, the device highlighted below (NYCO24363) is the one we spoke about last week which you said would not be ready 
on Friday to provide us with the responsive materials. Please let us know when this is done and how we can best get

Hi 
Would you mind canvassing for C-20 assistance for Friday? Maxwell's defense is asking to review discovery materials at 
MDC on Friday. Same request as before where it would be from 8am-3pm. It is digital evidence so a laptop and hard 
drive would have to be shown to them at MDC. It could potentially be several hours waiting while Maxwell and her team 
review the materials.

Squad C-20 is requesting assistance from two agents for the Maxwell investigation. They are looking for 2 volunteers to 
help out one day next week, possibly Wednesday or Thursday. They have to show some discovery to Maxwell and her 
defense team at MDC. It is digital evidence so a laptop and hard drive would have to be shown to them at MDC. It could 
potentially be several hours waiting while Maxwell and her team review the materials. Please let me know if you are able 
to assist

Thank you all for your help! Please see below regarding the Image/video file review. Please note that we need to have 
this completed by next Friday. We have ten devices to review at this time. I hope to have each of you set up with access 
to CAIR today and you'll be able to review this from your desk. I will sit down with each of you to help you navigate the 
system and the devices. I've already bookmarked the folders for the devices so all you will have to do is put the 
images/videos into the designated folders. In each of these categories, there are multiple devices; please be sure to only 
click on the device you are working on. I have bookmarked folders in different devices to keep the location of items found 
organized by device. I've split up the devices below. This is how they are labeled in the system. Let's keep in touch as you 
finish each device so we know when each device is complete.

All, 
Attached please find the review protocol for the image and video files from Epstein's devices. The protocol asks that all 
reviewers read the warrant and supporting affidavit, which are both attached here as well. I am also attaching a copy of 
EFTA00038215
--- PAGE 3 ---
the Maxwell indictment, which contains a photograph of Epstein and Maxwell. 
Once the USAO and FBI review teams are assembled, please let me know when would be a good time for me to have a 
call with them to talk through the review and answer any questions. 
In the first instance, we would ask that the FBI team review the following devices: 
• NYC024363 
• NYC024394 
• NYC024326 
• NYC024368 
• NYC024390 
• NYC024334 
• NYC027910 
• NYC024323 
• NYC024355 
• NYC027908 
Depending on how quickly the FBI and USAO teams move through the review, we may reassign some devices between the 
teams.

Subject: Epstein case 
Hi 
— 
We have had some nonsensical Cybertipline reports for this case that have not been something that we thought to 
forward you; however, today one of my analysts is working on a CT that she feels may want to be looked at. 
I wanted to check with you to see if you want it before I have her forward it to you. The analyst listened to the phone call 
to our call center, and she said that the woman sounds normal and organized in her thoughts, but who really knows 
She has named a few other people in the tip. I wanted to pass these names by you before my analyst does any searches 
on them to see if you think it is necessary. I don't want to waste a lot of time on this if she just watched the Netflix series, 
and had a dream.. ugh 
The Reporting Party (RP) is 
These are the people she is mentioning in the report: 
Just let me know how you want us to handle. 
I hope all is well with you!

Re: The Office of Professional Responsibility's Draft Report of Investigation into the 
U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida's Resolution of Its 2006-
2008 Federal Criminal Investigation of Jeffrey Epstein and Its Interactions with 
Victims during the Investigation 
Dear Mr. 
The Office of Professional Responsibility has been investigating allegations that 
prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida improperly resolved 
a federal criminal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein by negotiating and executing a federal non-
prosecution agreement (NPA) in 2007, and into judicial criticism of the government for failing to 
consult with the victims of Epstein's crimes before the NPA was signed and by misleading them 
regarding the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed. 
OPR has completed its investigation and has drafted a report setting forth its findings and 
conclusions and the bases for them. Because of the congressional, victim, and public interest in 
the investigation, OPR plans to release its final report to Congress and expects that its report will 
be released to the public. Because the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was the investigating 
agency and some of its work and special agents are mentioned in the report, OPR is providing you 
with its draft report for a sensitivity review. 
Please advise OPR if you have objections to the public release of information contained in 
the draft report. Please note that the sourcing citations in the footnotes will be removed from the 
final report. Therefore, names that appear in those footnotes, but which are otherwise not 
identified in the text of the report, will not appear in the final report. FBI personnel are not 
identified by name in the text of the report.

OPR would appreciate receiving your comments by Monday, September 14, 2020. 
Because OPR's draft report is confidential, please share it only with those members of your staff 
needed to evaluate the re ort's im act, if an , on our office's work. If ou have an 
uestions,

through and sit down with those of you I haven't. Everyone should be set up by end of day today to have access to the 
case. The AUSAs have asked that you read through the attachments to be familiar with it. They would also like to set up a 
call sometime later today to touch base with all of you about the review. Is there a time everyone could get on a call, 
maybe around 3:30 or a little later? 
Let me know.

Hi everyone, 
Thank you all for your help! Please see below regarding the Image/video file review. Please note that we need to have 
this completed by next Friday. We have ten devices to review at this time. I hope to have each of you set up with access 
to CAIR today and you'll be able to review this from your desk. I will sit down with each of you to help you navigate the 
system and the devices. I've already bookmarked the folders for the devices so all you will have to do is put the 
images/videos into the designated folders. In each of these categories, there are multiple devices; please be sure to only 
click on the device you are working on. I have bookmarked folders in different devices to keep the location of items found 
EFTA00038272
--- PAGE 2 ---
organized by device. I've split up the devices below. This is how they are labeled in the system. Let's keep in touch as you 
finish each device so we know when each device is complete.

Subject: (EXTERNAL EMAIL) - Epstein Image/Video File Review Protocol 
All, 
Attached please find the review protocol for the image and video files from Epstein's devices. The protocol asks that all 
reviewers read the warrant and supporting affidavit, which are both attached here as well. I am also attaching a copy of 
the Maxwell indictment, which contains a photograph of Epstein and Maxwell. 
Once the USAO and FBI review teams are assembled, please let me know when would be a good time for me to have a 
call with them to talk through the review and answer any questions. 
In the first instance, we would ask that the FBI team review the following devices:

Depending on how quickly the FBI and USAO teams move through the review, we may reassign some devices between the 
teams.

Re:

Dear Ms. Strauss: 
Please be advised that I have represented 
who is currently an 
inmate at Clinton Correctional Facility. By way of background I 
is a 
former Special Agent with the FBI and a former decorated Lt. Colonel and 
helicopter pilot who served our country with honor and distinction during the 
Vietnam War.  
has informed me he believes he possesses important 
information relative to the death of Jeffrey Epstein along with information 
regarding Ghislaine Maxwell and he possesses relevant information to an 
individual named J. Doe who visited him while an inmate in prison. 
I am respectfully requesting as a former Assistant United States Attorney 
and a present practicing attorney that you utilize your good office to interview 
 who seeks to lend you assistance in this investigation. It is my 
respectful opinion that 
possesses important and vital information that can 
assist in the interest of justice. 
Thank you for your consideration in this matter. 
Respectfully submitted,

Hello again, 
This is to confirm that the invitation was sent via email this afternoon to 14 attorneys, with requests to pass on 
to their clients; 6 victims; and a family member of one of the deceased victims. I've added a column "Invite 
sent for Nov 12 meeting." 
The victims for whom column G ("Contact information") is red-highlighted have a61 yet received an invitation 
via email, either directly or through a request to their attorneys to pass it on. If you have any additional 
thoughts on how to reach those individuals for whom no phone number or mailing address is listed, we would

Hi[, 
Thank you very, very much! I am not sure if the invitations have gone out but 
can confirm. For most survivors on 
the master list, we did not have direct email addresses. For many survivors, they also had multiple attorneys (i.e. 
different attorneys mentioned on different lists) so I was not sure who the most current was.

Here you are. When we send the invitations, we send the PDF (paper) and fillable. The PDF just makes it so 
nothing can modified. I also attached the working document - I removed the meta data so no one will know

Hi there, 
Just FYI here is the latest clean versions of both documents that 
is sending through clearance. 
Can I ask what you were proposing with re a more friendly "advisory" title for the COVID poster, which is currently titled 
"Temperature Screening in Progress for Visitors." I was not sure it needed changing but if so, can you clarify how you 
wanted it to read and do you have a word version for adjusting it? 
I am not free tomorrow morning but can also be available after 2:30 PM.

Hi everyone, 
Thank you all for your help! Please see below regarding the Image/video file review. Please note that we need to have 
this completed by next Friday. We have ten devices to review at this time. I hope to have each of you set up with access 
to CAIR today and you'll be able to review this from your desk. I will sit down with each of you to help you navigate the 
system and the devices. I've already bookmarked the folders for the devices so all you will have to do is put the 
images/videos into the designated folders. In each of these categories, there are multiple devices; please be sure to only

finish each device so we know when each device is complete.

All, 
Attached please find the review protocol for the image and video files from Epstein's devices. The protocol asks that all 
reviewers read the warrant and supporting affidavit, which are both attached here as well. I am also attaching a copy of 
the Maxwell indictment, which contains a photograph of Epstein and Maxwell. 
Once the USAO and FBI review teams are assembled, please let me know when would be a good time for me to have a 
call with them to talk through the review and answer any questions.

Stages of Emotions and Treatment After Sexual Trauma 
April 18, 2018 • Contributed by Camila Williams, PhD 
There may be many emotions to sort through after experiencing sexual trauma. These emotions are 
typically painful, so it is natural to want to avoid them. The problem is, these emotions don't tend to 
go away—they fester until you allow the time and space to work through them. 
A common cycle of emotions after surviving sexual trauma is: (1) guilt and shame, (2) blame and 
anger, (3) grieving/mourning, and (4) fear and anxiety. This cycle by no means captures everyone's 
experience after a trauma but is a general outline of common reactions. Let's consider them in more 
depth. 
I. (,t IL I k\D'NII k Nil 
There can be a lot of secrecy surrounding sexual trauma. Victims who come forward are often made 
to feel like they did something wrong. Some are advised to keep their experience quiet. People often 
blame the victim by outlining things they "should" or "should nor have done. 
Survivors of sexual trauma may internalize these messages and feel guilt and shame. They may 
replay in their minds the things they could have done to prevent or escape the trauma, even if they 
couldn't have done anything differently. They may feel guilty for having not stopped the abuse and 
ashamed for having been a victim of it. 
Learning to challenge these messages is one of the first hurdles of trauma treatment. Treatment at 
this stage focuses on self-compassion, understanding, and most importantly: accepting that sexual 
trauma is never the victim's fault. 
EFTA00038303
--- PAGE 2 ---
2. BI 
NIL .\NI) \\Fait 
Along with guilt and shame come blame and anger. Many times, survivors of sexual trauma will 
blame themselves for what happened and will direct anger at themselves. They beat themselves up 
with critical, hurtful, and mean thoughts and comments. Some may even engage in self-harming 
behaviors such as cutting as a coping strategy. 
A goal at this stage of treatment is to separate responsibility from blame. Again, no matter what 
happened, it is never a person's intention to get abused! Treatment focuses on challenging the 
blame; challenging the hurtful, critical thoughts; and learning to look at things from a new 
perspective and generate healthier, more adaptive thoughts. The blame and anger then shift to the 
perpetrator, as it should. 
Unfortunately, many people become stuck at this stage, fuming in anger and unable to move 
forward. Anger can make us feel more in control. When we are angry, people listen, do what we say, 
or leave us alone. There is power in anger that makes it hard to let go of. There can also be a fear 
that if one lets go of the anger, it means it was okay that the trauma happened (of course, its not!). 
Over time, chronic anger can lead to isolation, loneliness, and depression. Treatment focuses on 
validating the anger, understanding why it's there, recognizing anger as a protective warning sign, 
and learning to manage it before it escalates into verbal or physical aggression. 
3. G1(11., 
\101 HAIM; 
Grieving can help a survivor of sexual trauma to get unstuck and begin to move forward. There may 
be many things to grieve: loss of innocence; loss of childhood; loss of feeling safe; grief over 
mistrusting others and always feeling like something is "too good to be true"; grief over loss of time 
(for school, relationships, jobs, or time spent self-medicating and in depression); and grief over "what 
could have been." Grief can make us feel helpless, powerless, vulnerable, and weak. 
It is natural to want to fast-forward through grief or, better yet, stuff it. 
Unfortunately, there are no shortcuts through grieving. 
It is natural to want to fast-forward through grief or, better yet, stuff it. Unfortunately, there are no 
shortcuts through grieving. The more you try to avoid it, the more out-of-control your emotions may 
feel. You may begin to fear crying or "losing it" when something triggers you. A common complaint 
is "overreacting" to small things. But remember, your body is not just reading to the most recent 
"small thing"; it is also reacting to all the stressful events you experienced and stuffed away. 
Unpacking, unstuffing, and letting it all out is part of the grieving process. It is especially important 
that you set up a support system and a regular schedule of self-care activities. Treatment at this 
stage focuses on helping you establish the space, time, support to grieve and mourn. Treatment also 
helps you learn how to manage intense emotions so you are the one in control, not the emotions. 
EFTA00038304
--- PAGE 3 ---
4. FEAR k\D \ XIE I 
After working through the guilt, shame, blame, and anger, and taking time to grieve and mourn, 
many survivors of sexual trauma are left with a feeling of emptiness. All those emotions that were 
stuffed away used to take up that space. Now that they are gone, many ask, "Now what?" 
This phase of treatment focuses on building a life worth living. It is important to fill that hole with 
new relationships, activities, goals, and emotions, as staying in that empty place can put you at risk 
for becoming depressed and isolated. This process may bring a new set of challenges, as people—
regardless of whether they have experienced trauma—generally hesitate to step out of their comfort 
zones to try something new. 
Trying to build a new life tends to raise many fears and anxieties. Fears that your efforts won't work, 
that others will reject you, that your most critical thoughts were true. Anxiety about going to new 
places, being out in crowds, starting relationships, and trying unfamiliar things. 
Treatment at this stage attempts to help survivors of sexual trauma learn how to face their fears; to 
set healthy boundaries; to problem-solve and work toward specific and measurable goals; and to 
manage the natural anxieties that come with trying new approaches. 
f. 
\ ( Ll SR) \ 
There is hope after sexual trauma. Recovery is possible. It takes a lot of courage to reach out for 
support, but it is the first step in learning to trust yourself and the recovery process. 
April is Sexual Assault Awareness Month. Whatever the nature and scope of your trauma, this is a 
time to remind yourself that you are not alone. Many colleges, hospitals, and groups throughout the 
country are holding walks, fairs, clothesline projects, rallies, and other events. Look one up in your 
area, discover the community you deserve, and contact a therapist if you want support.

Thanks 
for following up. I actually spoke to OVS a couple of weeks ago to make sure that her application 
was with the other Epstein victims; and they gave this to me. 
Thanks for your help.

Hello= 
Please find 
OVS Acceptance letter and assignment of case number. She is initially eligible for $9,9999.99 
worth of counseling services paid because, on the advice of her attorney, she declined to disclose any financial 
information. When/If she gets to this threshold she could provide the information then for additional compensation. 
Please let me know if I can be of further assistance.

Apologies for the confusion, I was asked to complete the application wither if there was specific language 
that needed to go in, I'm sure I could have done that if provided with the language. 
If there is a glitch, I'm sure it could be recovered especially if we keep the lines of communication open. 
Wishing you all well.

- thanks for the quick response but as I told you previously all of the ovs forms were to be submitted 
together from the FBI; that was the agreement I had with them. I am confused on why you got the form 
completed without speaking to me. OVS asked for specific language on the form. Let's hope it goes through.

Hi 
Unfortun 
this appears to be a bad case of telephone. I spoke with 
who only had wonderful things to 
say abou 
m colleague from the state police. As you know I needed to go out unexpectedly. I discussed 
options with 
before I left and the option she chose was to meet with my collegue in the state police where 
she resides and do her ovs application there. 
The "strap
 thing that was told to-was 
that at some point the therapist will have to attest that he/she is 
seeingMand that it is related to her victimization. This we all know and is common. In an effort I believe to 
provide all possible information to-advised 
that if her treatment was no longer related to her 
victimization then she could be billed for it. A therapist can theoretically state portions are victim related and 
some are not. Although technically true, unlikely. 
My colleague is capable of submitting the application directly to ovs online and was willing to meet with 
right away and get it done in the most expeditious manner. The FBI form was provided by 
and 
I forwarded it to her to complete the package. 
Since my colleague works for the state 
lice she submits volumes of ovs applications and I consider her 
extremely knowledgable 
able. Mis out this week so I can check in whether she submitted the FBI 
form with the application. 
nformed me she forwarded you a copy of her ovs application via email already. 
has her first appointment with a therapist today. 
Let me know if I can be of further assistance.

Hey 
- I apologize for reaching out with you being out; but I received calls from both 
and her 
attorney regarding the ovs claim. They said that you referred her to meet with someone else who told her some 
strange things about the counseling reimbursement. 
also told me this person is submitting the OVS claim which is needed to be submitted by me with the FBI 
form. Please let me know who this is so they do not submit the form.

Gloria, 
We will make ourselves available to meet with your new client on 10/23. Because the victim meeting is being run by the 
FBI, their victim services folks are handling travel logistics. I'm cc'ing 
, who should be able to hopefully help 
coordinate travel. Would you please provide

Hi M, 
Hope all is well. Someone we work with who does a lot of intel-gathering on john review boards saw the following post 
on a review board called TNA. "Dollar Bill" is William Mersey. We prosecuted him for a felony promoting prostitution 
conspiracy; he had a federal case as well. Don't want to waste your time and this may be complete bs, but I didn't want to

Hey guys we came across his IC page which we believe is Maxwell's and should like to Subpoena (with NDO). 
Also just FYI we received the response from Facebook on the 2 accounts we subpoenaed that we thought may 
have been Maxwell's. It doesn't appear as though neither of them are associated with her according to IP 
locations and general content on the page.

Hi 
- I am a Victim Specialist in New York and am reaching out in hopes that you can assist or guide me in the right 
direction. As you may have seen we have an open case regarding Jeffrey Epstein for trafficking charges. There is an 
identified victim who lives in 
and she is asking for counseling assistance. How would I connect her to appropriate 
referrals? I have asked her where she lives and am waiting to hear back. Any assistance is greatly appreciated. I have 
copied the Case Agent 
if you have any questions. 
Thanks in advance! And Happy Thanksgiving!

Edward, 
This is sensitive, so it will be the first and last email depending on your discretion. You can choose to 
take it or trash it but this comes from a person that has been there and seen it all, as a former staff at 
the Zorro. 
The material below was taken from Jeffrey Epstein home as my insurance in case of future litigation 
against Epstein. SORRY NO QUESTIONS. 
What is damning about Jeffrey Epstein is yet to be written. Did you know 
Here are the video footage of Jeffrey Epstein:

As you requested we checked for common or repeat IP addresses in the Maxwell cell phone pen trap with 
negative results. We did find some random IP addresses in the pen trap that come back to facebook. 
This leads us to believe she either has a facebook page, or has been accessing facebook from her phone. We 
ran all of the phone numbers we've known to be associated with Maxwell through facebooks law enforcement 
portal and found two of them to be associated with facebook accounts. Through the portal we are not able to 
view the actual account but were able to see that there at least once existed an account that was connected 
to these phone numbers.

Team, 
Just so everyone is in the loop, I got a call from David Rodgers' attorney (in response to our email requesting an 
interview). Rodgers wants to be cooperative and will come in for an interview, but he is currently on a cruise, and his 
lawyers will need to talk to/meet with him after he gets back. They think late January/early February is a good timeframe 
to aim for. 
We discussed logistics (because his attorneys are here in NYC), and they want us to fly him up, which shouldn't be a 
problem. 
We'll check in with his attorney in a week or so and let you know.

Hi Bob- hope you are doing ok! I believe you were at the meeting in Miami where it was discussed that the FBI 
Victim Assistance would pay for up to six sessions of counseling for these victims. There is now for those 
victims that reside in Florida a cap of 12 counseling sessions; but all must be approved by the case agent prior to 
any sessions. 
Please feel free to call my cell at 
if you have any further questions.

Good afternoon everyone, 
I hope you and your families are all safe. I wanted to inform you that 
requested a therapy appointment as a 
result of her victimization by Mr. Epstein. I wanted to get your approval for the 12 sessions prior to her appointment next 
week. I believe she had met and interviewed with the FBI already. If you need any further information or have any questions, 
please do not hesitate to reach out. Thank you so much for your assistance and support!

Hi 
- I spoke to the other Attorney in Florida today; and she is representing the below victims. They are 
requesting the 12 counseling sessions. 
Can you confirm they are identified victims? 
Thanks

Thank you so much for giving me a call today to discuss the therapy options for my three clients who 
were among the original plaintiffs who filed civil lawsuits against Jeffrey E stein in South Florida. As I 
mentioned, 2 are still in th
and 1 is now living in 
II three are 
in need of counseling services. 
You mentioned that you will double-check the list of known JE victims to confirm they are eligible for 
therapy assistance. I am providing  these names to you confidentiality with the understanding  that they 
will never become part of a  public record and will otherwise remain confidential due to the women's 
statuses as victims of child sexual abuse by Jeffrey Epstein. They have never been  publicly identified 
in any court records or media. 
In the event that one or more of these women has not been previously identified to the FBI, please let 
me know what information you need to determine their eligibility and I will get it to you in short order. 
I would ask that all contact about these three women be through me (or my office) rather than with the 
women directly. As we discussed on the phone, among the lingering effects for each of them is a 
fundamental distrust of anyone trying to obtain information Epstein. He was not above lying and 
trickery during the course of the lawsuits and he certainly had enough resources to buy real-looking 
EFTA00038410
--- PAGE 2 ---
fake credentials for people to pose as FBI agents, so as sad as it is, they all assume that anyone who 
contacts them has to be lying about their identities and motives. Also, as I mentioned, none of them

It is probably best for everyone that I'm the 
Please let me know what you need to get the counseling for each up and running. I will contact the 
therapist that I know in the 
area that 
was interested in seeing to see if she takes credit 
cards, and I will also do some homework on 
hat you 
mentioned. 
will definitely need some referrals or recommendations if you have them; she does 
not have any particular therapist in mind at this time. 
Thanks again. And please know that I remain committed to assisting your team with their investi ation 
in any way that I can, even if it does not involve my clients specifically. Between 
and I, we probably have the best combined institutional knowledge of the case through 2011. I will 
readily admit that 
is a much better resource for everything post-2011. But if I can assist in any 
way, please let me know.

Hi 
- it was great speaking with you today! As discussed due to Florida Crime Victims Compensation not 
being available to victims where the crime was committed in Florida; the FBI Victim Services Division has 
approved to pay up to 12 counseling sessions for these individuals. 
If you have a client that would like to utilize this assistance - please send us their name for approval prior to any 
therapy. We can not pay for sessions that were not approved prior. All requests must be approved by the Case 
Agent 
. If they have not been confirmed a victim by the FBI prior; 
must confirm that they 
are a victim in this case. 
After they are approved - we can connect with the requested therapist to coordinate payment. 
Please let me know if you have any questions. 
Stay well-

air right now. I'll keep you posted when we are likely to go forward. Thanks for your help with this.

Good morning, 
Hope you're doing well. I wanted to reach out and touch base about possible sightings of Ghislaine Maxwell in 
Manchester. I know we spoke earlier this year about it and I believe you had mentioned that a local PD had 
seen her around town. Our AUSAs are asking about those sightings and requesting more detailed info- where 
she was seen and how often/how many times and how recently that had been. Any information you could 
provide about that would be helpful. 
Thank you,

Thanks for connecting us, 
Hey 
you may remember me from around this time last year when I catalogued and scanned a bunch of Miami 
evidence for the Epstein case. I'm now out on the JFK Airport squad, and I've been talking with 
about trying to get 
more involved in the FO's human trafficking work since I'm sure a lot of it moves through the airports. I'm hoping to 
maybe establish some stronger airport tripwires for it, so any human trafficking case experience I can get now to help me 
to understand the violation better would be great. 
So if you need people to help coming up, let me know. I'd still have to run it past my supervisor, but things are pretty 
flexible out here schedule-wise. So just let me know the details if you still need people! 
Best,

Good evening, 
Sorry for my late response; I was out of the office yesterday and I shifted my schedule late today because I'm just about to 
rotate in as the duty agent, so I'm just catching up now. 
But thank you, I'll definitely reach out to 
about that training! 
And yes, I actually helped out with the Epstein case a little bit when I was on Applicants, and I'd definitely be up to help 
out again! That would be great experience since I haven't done discovery from the Agent side yet. Thanks so much for 
thinking of me! 
I also have it on my list to message

I just left 290 with the case agents on Epstein/ maxwell case. They are going to canvas for agents to help them

Good afternoon, 
Hope you've been doing well, enjoying the summer, and staying healthy! Just wanted to follow-up on the conversation we 
had earlier in the year talking about me possibly getting hooked up with the human trafficking sitils to assist them now 
that I'm out at the airport. I actually spent a day at LIRA last week and got to meet some of the 
team to discuss how I 
might be able to supplement the work of their squad, and it was great to be able to chat with them. 
Unfortunately it turns out that most of the flight-tracking tools used by the JTTF are for international flights, whereas • 
es subjects are mostly flying domestic, which is kind of a bummer since we don't have a lot of ways to track that kind of 
movement. But I'm still trying to think of ways I can use my position at the airport to be helpful, and that brought me back 
to our discussion where we touched on the idea of providing trainings to staff at the airport, to hopefully establish better 
tripwires and/or encourage staff to call the airport squad when they see something potentially suspicious. I know you said 
you've given trainings on human trafficking before and you're familiar with the kind of training that would work at the 
airport, and I'm definitely interested in pursuing this idea to hopefully put it into action once airport operations start to 
return to normal. In the meantime, I want to brush up on the topic as much as I can. Would you happen to have access to 
any Bureau-created or law enforcement-specific training materials besides what would come up on a basic Google search? 
There's certainly a lot available via open sources, but if we have any internal presentation or training materials that you 
could direct me to I would love to take a look at them. Or if you have any recommendations for open source websites or 
articles, etc. on human trafficking that you've found particularly helpful, that would be great to know. 
Thanks as always for your help and advice!

the benefits) must fill out section 2 of the claim and sign 
the claim.

Court Ordered Restitution Information 
What is restitution? 
Restitution is compensation paid to a victim by the perpetrator of a criminal offense for the losses or injuries incurred as a 
result of the criminal offense. It must be ordered by the Court at the time of sentencing, and is considered part of the sentence. 
Restitution is NOT for payment of damages for future losses, mental anguish or "pain and suffering? 
When the District Attorney's (DA) office advises the Court that you have requested restitution or when the victim impact 
statement contained in the probation investigation report (pre-sentence, pre-plea or pre-disposition report) indicates that the 
victim seeks restitution, the Court must order restitution unless the interests of justice dictate otherwise. When the judge does 
not order restitution, the judge must clearly state his/her reasons on the record. 
What can I request as restitution? 
You can ask for any expense you incur as a result of the criminal offense — even for items the OVS may not be able to 
reimburse. Restitution may include, but is not limited to, reimbursement for medical bills, counseling expenses, loss of 
earnings, funeral expenses, insurance deductibles and the replacement of stolen or damaged property. 
Who is entitled to restitution? 
Anyone who has been the victim of a criminal offense and has suffered injuries, economic losses or damages can seek 
restitution. Many times, victims who deserve restitution do not request it. This can occur because victims are not aware that 
they are entitled to restitution, or do not know what steps to take to go about receiving the restitution they deserve. 
How do I ask for restitution? 
You should contact the DA's office and advise them of the extent of your injury, your out-of-pocket losses and the amount of 
damages you are requesting. 
It Is your responsibility to give the police, DA and, upon request, the local probation department copies of the bills and 
other documents showing the extent of your injuries, your out-of-pocket losses and the amount of damages you want 
considered by the Court. Your claim for restitution will be included in any probation investigation report (pre-sentence, pre-plea 
or pre-disposition report). Be sure to: 
• 
Keep accurate records such as original receipts of any expenses you have as a direct result of the criminal offense. 
• 
Give copies of these receipts to the police. DA and local probation department. 
You need to clearly explain your need for restitution as soon as possible to the DA, the victim/witness advocate, and the 
probation department. Plea agreements can occur within days of the actual criminal offense. If this information is not provided 
before the plea agreement and sentencing, you may have to pursue the perpetrator in Civil Court. 
The DA is under an obligation to petition the Court to order restitution on your behalf. 
In all felony criminal cases, many misdemeanor criminal cases and all juvenile delinquency and persons in need of supervision 
(PINS) cases, a pre-sentence or predisposition investigation report is required. The local probation department will contact you 
about the issue of restitution as it pertains to your case. 
How Is restitution determined? 
The amount of restitution is based on proof of your out-of-pocket losses incurred as a result of the criminal offense. The 
perpetrator has a right to object to the amount of restitution. The Court may hold a hearing on the issue of restitution where the 
Court may consider the perpetrator's ability to pay. The DA's office may contact you and ask you to testify at the restitution 
hearing. If you have a concern about appearing personally in Court, you should explore alternatives with the DA assigned to 
your case. 
If the OVS has paid your bills, the Court may order that restitution payments be made to the OVS for those paid items. It is 
important that you advise the DA's Office that you filed a claim with the OVS. 
If you filed a claim with the OVS, it is important that you advise the OVS if the Court orders the perpetrator to pay restitution.

Good evening, 
Sorry for my late response; I was out of the office yesterday and I shifted my schedule late today because I'm just about to 
rotate in as the duty agent, so I'm just catching up now. 
But thank you, I'll definitely reach out to 
about that training! 
And yes, I actually helped out with the Epstein case a little bit when I was on Applicants, and I'd definitely be up to help 
out again! That would be great experience since I haven't done discovery from the Agent side yet. Thanks so much for 
thinking of me! 
I also have it on my list to message 
from I= to reach out in the same way I've done with =, 
so that 
could be very timely. Will let you know if I make some headway!

I just left 290 with the case agents on Epstein/ maxwell case. They are going to canvas for agents to help them

Good afternoon, 
Hope you've been doing well, enjoying the summer, and staying healthy! Just wanted to follow-up on the conversation we 
had earlier in the year talking about me possibly getting hooked up with the human trafficking sjads to assist them now 
that I'm out at the airport. I actually spent a day at LIRA last week and got to meet some of the 
team to discuss how I 
might be able to supplement the work of their squad, and it was great to be able to chat with them. 
Unfortunately it turns out that most of the flight-tracking tools used by the JTTF are for international flights, whereas • 
es subjects are mostly flying domestic, which is kind of a bummer since we don't have a lot of ways to track that kind of 
movement. But I'm still trying to think of ways I can use my position at the airport to be helpful, and that brought me back 
to our discussion where we touched on the idea of providing trainings to staff at the airport, to hopefully establish better 
tripwires and/or encourage staff to call the airport squad when they see something potentially suspicious. I know you said 
you've given trainings on human trafficking before and you're familiar with the kind of training that would work at the 
airport, and I'm definitely interested in pursuing this idea to hopefully put it into action once airport operations start to 
return to normal. In the meantime, I want to brush up on the topic as much as I can. Would you happen to have access to 
any Bureau-created or law enforcement-specific training materials besides what would come up on a basic Google search? 
There's certainly a lot available via open sources, but if we have any internal presentation or training materials that you 
could direct me to I would love to take a look at them. Or if you have any recommendations for open source websites or 
articles, etc. on human trafficking that you've found particularly helpful, that would be great to know. 
Thanks as always for your help and advice! 
Best,

Importance: Normal 
Can you send this request for foreign travel up the chain to the ADIC for approval? Due to travel restrictions, AD 
IOD has been granting approval for international travel directly to field division heads. CACHTU will support 
this request with funding. Summary below. 
This email is to request the foreign travel to London for two agents, accompanied by SDNY AUSA's for the 
week of March 16th, in furtherance of the Jeffrey Epstein investigation. We expect to leave on the 17th and 
return on the 20th. The u ose of this trip is to interview a crucial witness in this investigation. The witness is. 
who could prove especially crucial since it is believed this witness was the target 
subject's personal assistant and was an eyewitness to the sexual abuse of a minor, therefore this witness could 
significantly corroborate the victim's accounts. The time and location for this interview has been arranged by the 
witness' attorney who has been historically difficult about changes. Both the witness and 
attorney reside in 
London and are not currently willing to travel to the US. This interview could prove to be vital to the indictment 
of one of Jeffrey Epstein co-conspirators.

Good mornina 
I have a client who is a Florida victim and she is interested in trying to obtain FBI 
assistance with her therapy expenses. She has started sessions and the counselor has agreed to wait for 
payment. Her name is 
. Please let me know how we need to proceed. She currently 
resides in Ohio and I can assist in coordinating a time for her statement. 
Thank you!

FYI, from the Shoppers Travel travel agent 
nfortunately this only goes back to 1999, which is brutal — just a couple 
would be so helpful! Sire 
ights in 2000 and 2001 (for the enterprising searchers, don't miss 
Nis 
page 11), plus one o 
s well as various other folks we know well. Also note that they don't have 
itiner 
to of ticket issue (not date of travel).

How does that work? 
AG says Epstein lawyers have agreed to revise victim 
compensation fund protocol 
• Jun 1, 2020 
Attorneys for sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's estate and the Virgin Islands government have resolved disputes 
over a proposed victims' compensation fund, and V.I. Attorney General Denise George said she "will allow the 
release of a portion of estate funds for the victims so that the program may proceed." 
George issued the written statement Friday, saying that her office has reached an "agreement in principle" for a 
victim compensation program with the estate's and victims' attorneys. 
The estate proposed the fund in November as a way for Epstein's victims to receive compensation without 
having to go to court, after Epstein died by suicide in a Manhattan jail cell on Aug. 10 while awaiting trial on 
new charges. 
In January, George filed a civil enforcement action under the territory's Criminally Influenced and Corrupt 
Organizations Act against Epstein's estate and six of his companies, claiming that Epstein and his attorneys used 
the Economic Development Commission's tax benefit program to save millions of dollars that helped fund his 
criminal sex trafficking operation. 
As part of that action, George placed liens on the more than $600 million estate that have restricted his attorneys 
from paying settlements to victims, and argued that the terms of the compensation fund are illegal and help 
protect others who conspired with Epstein to abuse dozens of women over the last two decades. 
V.I. Superior Court Judge Carolyn Hermon-Purcell has said she cannot move forward with probate until George 
and Epstein's attorneys resolved their differences, and George lifts the liens. 
George said in the statement Friday that she's now willing to do that, and "the Attorney General's Office, 
working closely with Epstein's victims and their counsel, have now reached an agreement upon the terms of the 
fund, which include a set of reforms that provide a process that will be more fair, credible, and victim-oriented." 
George said she's always supported the existence of such a fund, which "would allow victims to avoid the 
publicity and trauma of a trial and provide them, promptly, with a measure of justice and closure," according to 
the statement. "The victim compensation fund as it stands now, is a substantial improvement from the original 
victims' claim fund proposed by the estate." 
According to George, the victim compensation fund now includes: 
• Involvement of victim advocate 
and the country's preeminent expert and 
advocate on child sexual abuse issues. This will help ensure that the decisions of the fund administrator are fully 
informed by and sensitive to the unique experiences and needs of survivors of trafficking and sexual abuse. 
• Dedicated funding to ensure that victims who have not yet come forward or who are not satisfied with the 
claims process or award can opt-out without sacrificing the chance of a judgment or recovery. 
• Protections to ensure that information shared by victims in the claims process is not provided to the estate and, 
potentially, used against the claimant or other victims. 
• Access to counseling and referral services through the FBI Victim Services program and Child USA. 
EFTA00038493
--- PAGE 4 ---
• Approval of the program's administrative budget by the Probate Court and monthly reporting to the Attorney 
General's Office and the Probate Court on the number and value of claim awards. 
"The attorney general opposed the estate's initial demand that, in order to obtain funds under the program, 
victims be required to sign broad releases to protect other individuals who sexually abused them. With that broad 
release in place, the Fund could not ensure a fundamentally fair and legally sufficient process for victims who 
choose to participate," according to the statement. "The parties now agree, and the program administrator has 
committed, that no information obtained solely through the program by the estate will be disclosed publicly or 
used by the estate in defending itself from any claim, regardless of forum." 
The estate "has agreed that there is no assertion that the attorney general's release of compensation program 
funds does not act as a waiver of any ability by the government to object to the program's administrative 
expenses, including those paid with these initial funds," according to the statement. 
"I continue to admire the tremendous bravery and strength of the women who have come forward to work with 
my office on this process," George said. "I'm hopeful the agreement will receive final approval, so these women 
are able to receive the help they need. My office will forcefully continue its work to hold accountable Epstein's 
criminal enterprise through the Government's CICO lawsuit and send a clear message that the USVI is not, and 
will not, be a safe haven for sex traffickers or sexual abuse."

We are going to be using Webex. I'm going to send the link to you as soon as I get it from the AUSA. Completely up to

I should have the link shortly.

Please let me know if you are able to assist on 4/13, 4/14 or 4/15 
Squad C-20 is requesting two or three agents to assist with Maxwell and her defense team reviewing evidence at 500 
Pearl Street from Tuesday April 13 throw 
Thursday April 15. This will be from 9:00am and continue for the entire day 
for all three days. AUSA 
will be present as well for the review. Please see below for additional info. 
• 
Maxwell and her defense team will all be present in the proffer room area on the 5th floor of the 500 Pearl Street 
courthouse for the primary review. This review will begin on April 13, 2021 and will continue every day thereafter until 
the review is complete. The logistics for this review are as follows: 
o 
The Marshals will produce Maxwell to 500 Pearl Street each morning by approximately 9:30am. Defense counsel are 
expected to arrive each morning at approximately 9:30am. We will need at least one FBI agent with a handcuff key who is 
responsible for pulling Maxwell from the Marshal cellblock and monitoring her (the same way an agent would monitor any 
proffering inmate at 500 Pearl) throughout the day. Please note that an agent will likely need to escort Maxwell to the 
bathroom dulgilie day as well. 
o 
AUSA 
has reserved three proffer moms for this review: The largest will be where the FBI can put the 
evidence for review. The second largest will be where the defense can meet privately, without any of the evidence items, to 
confer among themselves. The smallest will be a break area available for any agents and/or AUSAs who are not currently 
monitoring the evidence review or maintaining custody of Maxwell.

Hey all, 
I thought it might be easier if we were able to get on a quick call to talk a little logistics next week and answer any 
questions you have. I'm sure everyone is busy but if at least someone who is helping each day does not mind jumping on 
a call tomorrow that might be helpful. I'm not sure who has or has not pulled a prisoner from Marshal custody so we can 
go over those logistics as well on the phone. Let me know if sometime tomorrow works for you. 
Thanks!

Thank you so much for helping out next week. I don't anticipate we will need four agents for Tuesday and Thursday so if 
anyone has something else pressing feel free to bow out. I'll be sending you all another email shortly and cc'ing AUSA 
who will be present at 500 Pearl all three days. She will meet you at 500 Pearl on the designated date at 
around 9am or shortly before. Maxwell and her team will be arriving at 9:30am. The evidence unit is transporting all 
evidence to 500 Pearl and that has already been coordinated. Please make sure to have a handcuff key on you. The 
review of evidence each day will last until 4:30pm. The evidence unit will transport evidence back so none of you need to 
worry about any evidence being transported. 
SOS 
will also be present all three days and has been working this case so she is familiar with everything. 
Feel free to reach out to her as well. She is cc'd on this email. 
That's the short overview. Feel free to reach out to me on my cell with any concerns or questions. 
will be in 
touch with you all as well. Thank you all for assisting with this. This is a huge help.

Hi =I 
I am not sure about everyone else's availability today, but I know SA 
(cc'd on this email) and I are 
both doing a PSI today from 9:30am - 12:30pm and are available for a call anytime outside of that window. We 
are both doing the Thursday 4/15/21 shift. 
Let me know when works best for you and everyone else to get on a call.

I thought it might be easier if we were able to get on a quick call to talk a little logistics next week and answer 
any questions you have. I'm sure everyone is busy but if at least someone who is helping each day does not mind 
jumping on a call tomorrow that might be helpful. I'm not sure who has or has not pulled a prisoner from 
Marshal custody so we can go over those logistics as well on the phone. Let me know if sometime tomorrow 
works for you.

Hello everyone, 
Thank you so much for helping out next week. I don't anticipate we will need four agents for Tuesday and 
Thursday so if anyone has something else pressing feel free to bow out. I'll be sending you all another email 
shortly and cc'ing AUSA 
who will be present at 500 Pearl all three days. She will meet you at 
500 Pearl on the designated date at around 9am or shortly before. Maxwell and her team will be arriving at 
9:30am. The evidence unit is transporting all evidence to 500 Pearl and that has already been coordinated. Please 
make sure to have a handcuff key on you. The review of evidence each day will last until 4:30pm. The evidence 
unit will transport evidence back so none of you need to wony about any evidence being transported. 
SOS 
will also be present all three days and has been working this case so she is familiar with 
everything. Feel free to reach out to her as well. She is cc'd on this email. 
That's the short overview. Feel free to reach out to me on my cell with any concerns or questions. 
will 
be in touch with you all as well. Thank you all for assisting with this. This is a huge help.

Hi Erica - since these are all handled through USCIS we really are unable to speak on the best route. I would speak to an 
Immigration Attorney who routinely works these types of cases; they would have a better idea the number of visas 
approved each year and the timeframe. 
I could connect you someone at Legal Aid who works on these all of the time- would you like me to connect you to her?

Hey= 
I attached the three spreadsheets showing what is likely to be transported to 500 Pearl. Below is some of the logistical 
information. 
• Maxwell and her defense team will all be present in the proffer room area on the 5," floor of the 500 Pearl Street 
courthouse for the primary review. This review will begin on April 13 2021 and will continue every day thereafter 
until the review is complete. The logistics for this review are as follows: 
• The Marshals will produce Maxwell to 500 Pearl Street each morning by approximately 9:30am. Defense 
counsel are expected to arrive each morning at approximately 9:30am. 
• There are three proffer rooms for this review: The largest will be where the FBI can put the evidence for 
review. The second largest will be where the defense can meet privately, without any of the evidence 
items, to confer among themselves. The smallest will be a break area available for any agents and/or 
AUSAs who are not currently monitoring the evidence review or maintaining custody of Maxwell. 
• There are three annotated spreadsheets of the evidence in this case. Each day, the FBI will need to plan 
to produce all of the evidence with the notation "500 Pearl" in the column entitled "Plan for Review by 
Defense" in each of the three attached spreadsheets. 
• At least one agent and at least one AUSA should plan to be in the room whenever the defense is 
reviewing the evidence. The AUSA will field any questions from the defense. 
• At the end of each review day, the AUSA plans to ask the defense to identify any items that do not need to 
be brought back to 500 Pearl the next day, which will hopefully make each subsequent review day less 
burdensome for the FBI. 
• Three members of the defense team plan to travel to the Bronx warehouse to review evidence that the FBI is not 
producing to 500 Pearl Street. The logistics for that review are as follows: 
• This will be Monday, April 120. 
• For this review, the defense team will be looking to review all evidence with the notation "Bronx 
Warehouse" in the column entitled "Plan for Review by Defense" in each of the three attached 
spreadsheets. 
• At least one agent and at least one AUSA will be present to monitor the review. The AUSA will field any 
questions from the defense. 
• The defense team will bring a camera to photograph certain of the items to be reviewed. 
Thank you for assisting with this!

Hi 
Since I know you're juggling a bunch and also about to be traveling for the next two weeks, I wanted to check in on the 
status of the request for the physical evidence from the 72 case. Is that in transit? 
Thanks so much,

Our client has requested that we cancel tomorrow's meeting. She has now had to recount her interactions with 
Epstein one too many times, and since it's her understanding that it's unlikely that any of her information would 
in fact materially advance your current prosecutions, she'd prefer to forego another interview. 
Hope that's ok on your end, and of course let us know if you have any questions at all.

Hi 
time. 
— I hope all is well. I am sure you are swamped with your case, so I don't want to take up too much of your 
After we interviewed Larry Visoski in November for our case, we have been trying to coordinate with our HSI partners to 
interview our subject, in an effort to close the loop on our case. We have finally set a date and are traveling to South 
Carolina next week to interview him. (Our subject is a CBP employee who previously covered St. Thomas airport, and 
supposedly knew/socialized with Epstein). 
Just in case, I wanted to check in with you to see if there was anything in particular that you would want me to ask our 
subject while we have him, if it helps you. 
Best regards, 
Specral Agent

Hey 
I attached the three spreadsheets showing what is likely to be transported to 500 Pearl. Below is some of the logistical 
information. 
• 
Maxwell and her defense team will all be present in the proffer room area on the 51h floor of the 500 Pearl Street 
courthouse for the primary review. This review will begin on April 13 2021 and will continue every day thereafter 
until the review is complete. The logistics for this review are as follows: 
o 
The Marshals will produce Maxwell to 500 Pearl Street each morning by approximately 9:30am. Defense 
counsel are expected to arrive each morning at approximately 9:30am. 
o 
There are three proffer rooms for this review: The largest will be where the FBI can put the evidence for 
review. The second largest will be where the defense can meet privately, without any of the evidence 
items, to confer among themselves. The smallest will be a break area available for any agents and/or 
AUSAs who are not currently monitoring the evidence review or maintaining custody of Maxwell. 
o 
There are three annotated spreadsheets of the evidence in this case. Each day, the FBI will need to plan 
to produce all of the evidence with the notation "500 Pearl" in the column entitled "Plan for Review by 
Defense" in each of the three attached spreadsheets. 
o 
At least one agent and at least one AUSA should plan to be in the room whenever the defense is 
reviewing the evidence. The AUSA will field any questions from the defense. 
o 
At the end of each review day, the AUSA plans to ask the defense to identify any items that do not need to 
be brought back to 500 Pearl the next day, which will hopefully make each subsequent review day less 
burdensome for the FBI. 
• 
Three members of the defense team plan to travel to the Bronx warehouse to review evidence that the FBI is not 
producing to 500 Pearl Street. The logistics for that review are as follows: 
o 
This will be Monday, April 12th. 
o 
For this review, the defense team will be looking to review all evidence with the notation "Bronx 
Warehouse" in the column entitled "Plan for Review by Defense" in each of the three attached 
spreadsheets. 
o 
At least one agent and at least one AUSA will be present to monitor the review. The AUSA will field any 
questions from the defense. 
o 
The defense team will bring a camera to photograph certain of the items to be reviewed. 
Thank you for assisting with this! 
Feel free to reach out with any questions! 
Thanks, 
IMO

Projected Date(s) of Travel (Provide justification if extended travel): 3/17/2021-3/19/2021 
Where traveling: Durango, CO 
Case Summary: 
FBI New York, in coordination with the Southern District of New York's United States Attorney's Office, 
has been investigating the sexual exploitation and abuse of minors committed by JEFFREY EPSTEIN and 
his co-conspirators. EPSTEIN was charged and arrested with sex trafficking and conspiracy in July 
2019. In addition to EPSTEIN, co-conspirators have also been investigated, including GHISLAINE 
MAXWELL. MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and contributed to EPSTEIN's abuse of minors by recruiting, 
grooming, and abusing minors they knew to be under the age of 18. MAXWELL was charged and 
arrested in July 2020 with enticement of a minor, transportation of a minor, conspiracy to entice a 
minor, conspiracy to transport a minor, and perjury. 
Purpose of Travel (victim interview(s); witness interview(s); search warrant; arrest warrant; etc.): 
We will be meeting with a victim and to conduct an interview pertaining to her abuse by EPSTEIN and 
MAXWELL. Victim has been interviewed over video conference in the past but we hope to conduct a 
more in depth interview in person as she may be chosen as a trial witness against MAXWELL. 
Has a CAFI been consulted if interviewing minor(s)? If no, explain? N/A 
Name(s) of Personnel Traveling (If requesting more than one Agent/TFO from the field office, please 
provide justification. ex: pending state charges; multiple victims; rapport with victim(s)/witness(es); 
etc.): 
SA 
& TFOare 
expecting to interview a victim over a 1-2 day period. Due to 
the likelihood of a possible superseding indictment and eventual trial and the rapport we have 
developed with this witness, both case agents are requesting permission to travel. Victim has previously 
met with FBI victim specialist and it has been determined that she will benefit more from an in-person 
interview.

Epstein Investigation Summary & Timeline 
FBI Miami investigation: 
• 
In 2005, the West Palm Beach Police Department, and then FBI Miami, initiated an 
investigation of Epstein after parents of a victim reported to law enforcement that Epstein 
had sexually abused their daughter from 2002-2005. 
• 
Those investigations spanned approximately two years and included, among other things, 
interviews with approximately 35 victims, a search warrant executed on Epstein's Florida 
(FL) residence, and detailed analysis of various phone and flight records. 
FBI New York investigation: 
• 
On December 6, 2018, FBI NY initiated a case after Southern District of New York (SDNY) 
contacted FBI NY regarding several victims that had been sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein 
in the mid 2000's. 
• 
Beginning in at least 2002, Epstein enticed and recruited dozens of minor girls to engage in 
sex acts with him, for which he paid the victims hundreds of dollars in cash. Some of his 
victims were as young as 14. 
• 
He undertook this activity in at least two different locations, including his mansion in 
Manhattan, New York and his estate in Palm Beach, Florida. 
• 
Searches were executed at both locations and it bears noting that, contrary to some news 
reports, these searches did not reveal any cameras in any of the bedrooms or massage 
rooms at Epstein's residences. 
• 
In creating and maintaining a network of minor victims whom he abused, Epstein worked 
with others, including employees and associates who facilitated his exploitation of minors 
by, among other things, contacting victims and scheduling their sexual encounters with 
Epstein, both in New York and in Florida. 
Indictment of Epstein 
• 
From January 2019 through June 2019 multiple victim witness interviews were conducted in 
New York and Florida 
• 
The identified victims' ages ranged from approximately 14 to 17, with the majority having been 
approximately 15 or 16 when they were recruited to perform sex acts for and with Epstein. In 
addition to the sex acts, victims would have to perform massages on Epstein nude or partially 
nude. Victims were paid approximately $200 to $300 each time they went to Epstein's 
residence.

homicide who has been approved for the death penalty. Epstein was removed from his 
cell and has been medically evaluated. The Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) 
initiated an investigation per their SOPs. Per SONY, the Washington Post has made an 
inquiry of the incident. 
• 
On July 29, 2019, FBI and SDNY met with Epstein's attorneys, who, in very general terms, 
discussed the possibility of a resolution of the case, and the possibility of the defendant's 
cooperation. 
• 
On August 10, 2019, at approximately 7:30am, FBI NY was notified that Epstein committed 
suicide in his jail cell at the MCC in Manhattan, NY. NY VCT squad C-19 launched an 
investigation into the possible assault of a federal inmate. C-19 began coordinating with BOP,

I'm reattaching the master list I compiled along with all of the source documents for RIDS. While I was going 
through all of the names, I saw that there were different versions of names on the different documents. For the 
ETS list, RIDS or someone down there in Virginia should go through the lists slowly to make sure we are 
searching for all permutations of victims names so nothing accidentally gets left un-readacted.

Hello all, 
As an FYI, the Merson Law claimants, who have been sending us admin claims every other day, have filed suit in the 
District of D.C. I am not sure if you were tracking the SDNY lawsuit, but the Plaintiffs' voluntarily dismissed their lawsuit

Case 1:17-cv-03956-PGG Document 64 Filed 06/25/24 Page 1 of 20 
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
RADAR ONLINE LLC and JAMES 
ROBERTSON, 
Plaintiffs, 
-against-
FEDERAL BUREAU OF 
INVESTIGATION, 
Defendant. 
ORDER 
Civ. 3956 (PGG) 
PAUL G. GARDEPHE, U.S.D.J.: 
Plaintiffs Radar Online LLC and James Robertson bring this action under the 
Freedom of Information Act ("FOIA"), seeking records related to the FBI's investigation and 
prosecution of financier Jeffrey Epstein for child sex trafficking crimes. (
 Am. Cmplt. (Dkt. 
No. 12)) Plaintiff Radar Online is an online investigative news outlet and Plaintiff Robertson is 
one of its senior editors. (Id. ¶¶ 2-3) 
Plaintiffs submitted their FOIA request to the Federal Bureau of Investigation 
("FBI") on April 20, 2017. (Id.¶ 10) Plaintiffs received no response, and filed this action on 
May 25, 2017. (Cmplt. (Dkt. No. 1)) The Amended Complaint was filed on August 28, 2017. 
(Am. Cmplt. (Dkt. No. 12)) After an initial case management conference on September 7, 2017, 
the FBI agreed to begin producing documents at a rate of 500 pages per month. The FBI has 
now processed 11,571 responsive pages, most of which were redacted in part or withheld in full 
based on certain exemptions to disclosure under FOIA. (Second Seidel Decl. (Dkt. No. 58)1 3) 
In July 2019, Jeffrey Epstein was arrested and charged with new Federal offenses, 
at which point the FBI asserted Exemption 7(A) to FOIA — the exemption for "records or 
information compiled for law enforcement purposes[,] .. . [the disclosure of which] could

Case 1:17-cv-03956-PGG Document 64 Filed 06/25/24 Page 2 of 20 
reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings" 5 U.S.C. § 552(bX7)(A) — 
over pages that were previously processed and withheld and over all "remaining responsive 
records." (a. 1 7) 
On December 10, 2020, this Court directed the parties to file cross-motions for 
summary judgment. (Dkt. No. 26) In a September 19, 2023 order (the "Summary Judgment 
Order"), this Court granted in part and denied in part each side's cross-motion. (Summary 
Judgment Order (Dkt. No. 51)) In its Order, this Court directed the parties to file a joint letter 
addressing next steps, including a proposed schedule for the FBI's revised declarations and any 
renewed motions for summary judgment. (s., at 54) I On October 3, 2023, this Court set a 
briefing schedule for the parties' renewed cross-motions for summary judgment. (Dkt. No. 53) 
For the reasons stated below, the FBI's motion for summary judgment will be 
granted, and Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment will be denied. 
BACKGROUND'
I. 
FACTS 
In support of its renewed summary judgment motion, the FBI submitted a revised 
declaration from Maureen Comey, an Assistant United States Attorney ("AUSA") in the United 
States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York. (Third Comey Decl. (Dkt. No. 
59)1 1), and a revised declaration from Michael G. Seidel, the Section Chief of the 
Record/Information Dissemination Section ("RIDS") of the FBI's Information Management 
Division ("IMD"). (Second Seidel Decl. (Dkt. No. 58) 1 1) 
The page numbers referenced in this opinion correspond to the page numbers designated by 
this District's Electronic Case Files ("ECF") system. 
The relevant facts and procedural history are set forth in greater detail in the Summary 
Judgment Order and are only summarized below. (Summary Judgment Order (Dkt. No. 51)) 
Familiarity with the Summary Judgment Order is assumed.

Case 1:17-cv-03956-PGG Document 64 Filed 06/25/24 Page 3 of 20 
A. 
Plaintiffs' FOIA Request and the Instant Action 
Epstein was a financier who in June 2008 pleaded guilty to "a criminal charge of 
procuring prostitution of a minor," and served thirteen months of an eighteen-month sentence. 
(Second Seidel Decl. (Dkt. No. 58)1 6) On April 20, 2017, Plaintiff Robertson submitted a 
FOIA request to the FBI seeking "all documents relating to the FBI's investigation and 
prosecution" of Epstein. (First Seidel Decl., Ex. A. (FOIA Request) (Dkt. No. 50-1) at 4) 
On July 2, 2019, Epstein was indicted by a federal grand jury in this District on 
"one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking .. . [and] one count of sex trafficking." 
(Second Seidel Decl. (Dkt. No. 58)1 6 (citing United States v. Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 (RMB) 
(S.D.N.Y.), Indictment (Dkt. No. 2))) After the July 2, 2019 indictment, the FBI "began to 
categorically assert Exemption 7(A) with respect to information in the remaining documents it 
was processing .. . on the basis that release could negatively impact the then-pending 
prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein and any related investigations." (l 17) The FBI further 
"asserted Exemption 7(A) over all information that had been withheld under other exemptions 
prior to that date." atl.) 
Epstein committed suicide at the Metropolitan Correction Center in Manhattan on 
August 10, 2019, while the charges against him were pending. OA (citing United States v. 
Epstein 19 Cr. 490 (RMB), Nolle Prosequi (Dkt. No. 52))) 
B. 
The Prosecution of Ghislaine Maxwell 
On June 29, 2020, Ghislaine Maxwell was indicted by a grand jury in this District 
on "one count of conspiracy to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts"; "one count 
of enticement of a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts"; "one count of conspiracy to 
transport minors with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity"; "one count of transportation

Case 1:17-cv-03956-PGG Document 64 Filed 06/25/24 Page 4 of 20 
of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity"; "and two counts of perjury." (Third 
Comey Decl. (Dkt. No. 59) 1 6) 
On December 29, 2021, a jury found Maxwell guilty of enticing a minor to travel 
to engage in illegal sex acts, transporting minors with the intent to engage in criminal sexual

Dkt. Sheet at Dec. 29, 2021) On June 28, 2022, Maxwell was sentenced to 20 years' 
imprisonment. (Third Comey Decl. (Dkt. No. 59) 1 8; 20 Cr. 330, Judgment (Dkt. No. 696)) 
On July 7, 2022, Maxwell appealed her conviction to the Second Circuit. (Third

H. 
THE SEPTEMBER 19.2023 SUMMARY JUDGMENT ORDER 
In its September 19, 2023 Order, this Court granted the FBI summary judgment as 
to records withheld under Exemption 3 pursuant to the Child Victims' Act (Summary Judgment 
Order (Dkt. No. 51) at 26); Exemption 5 for attorney work-product privilege CA at 31-33); 
Exemptions 6 and 7(C) to protect persons from an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy (a 
at 33-42); Exemption 7(D) to protect confidential information provided by local law enforcement 
agencies (a. at 4748); and Exemption 7(E) to protect against disclosure of law enforcement 
techniques, procedures, and guidelines. 
at 48-51) 
As to Exemption 7(A), this Court found that the FBI's invocation of this 
Exemption was timely and that the requested records were compiled for law enforcement 
purposes and related to a pending or prospective law enforcement proceeding. (IS at 11-18) 
The FBI, however, "ha[d] not explicitly linked any of the document categories — whether 
Seidel's or Comey's — to the four types of potential harm cited in the 2021 Comey declaration."

(I at 21) As a result, this Court denied the FBI's motion for summary judgment without 
prejudice as to Exemption 7(A) because the FBI had not demonstrated that the disclosure of the 
requested records would interfere with pending or prospective law enforcement proceedings.

This Court also denied without prejudice the FBI's motion for summary judgment 
as to records withheld under Exemption 3 pursuant to the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Act, 
U.S.C. § 5038, which shields the arrest information and criminal history of third-party 
juveniles, and Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e), which shields matters occurring before the grand jury. (_0, 
at 26-31) 
Finally, this Court denied without prejudice the FBI's motion for summary 
judgment as to records withheld under Exemption 7(D) for the protection of information 
provided under an explicit or implicit assurance of confidentiality, and for information provided 
by foreign agencies. (Id. at 4247) 
As noted above, in the Summary Judgment Order, this Court directed the parties 
to submit a joint letter as to next steps, and to propose a "schedule for the FBI's submission of 
revised declarations, as well as any renewed motions for summary judgment." (W, at 54) After 
the parties submitted a joint letter (Dkt. No. 52), this Court issued an October 3, 2023 order 
setting a briefmg schedule for the parties' renewed cross-motions for summary judgment. (Dkt. 
No. 53)

judgment. (Dkt. Nos. 56, 61) 
DISCUSSION 
I. 
LEGAL STANDARDS 
A. 
Rule 56 standard 
Summary judgment is warranted where the moving party shows that "there is no 
genuine dispute as to any material fact" and that it "is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." 
Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). "A dispute about a `genuine issue' exists for summary judgment purposes 
where the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could decide in the non-movant's favor." 
Beyer v. County of Nassau, 524 F.3d 160, 163 (2d Cir. 2008). "When no rational jury could find 
in favor of the nonmoving party because the evidence to support its case is so slight, there is no 
genuine issue of material fact and a grant of summary judgment is proper." Gallo v. Prudential 
Residential Servs.. Ltd. P'ship, 22 F.3d 1219, 1224 (2d Cir. 1994) (citing Dister v. Cont'l Grp., 
Inc., 859 F.2d 1108, 1114 (2d Cir. 1988)). 
In deciding a summary judgment motion, the Court "`resolve[s] all ambiguities, 
and =digs] all factual inferences that could rationally be drawn, in favor of the party opposing 
summary judgment."' Spinelli v. City of New York, 579 F.3d 160, 166 (2d Cir. 2009) (quoting 
Brown v. Henderson, 257 F.3d 246, 251 (2d Cir. 2001) (internal quotation marks and citation 
omitted)). However, a 'party may not rely on mere speculation or conjecture as to the true 
nature of the facts to overcome a motion for summary judgment. . . . [M]ere conclusory 
allegations or denials ... cannot by themselves create a genuine issue of material fact where 
none would otherwise exist.'" Hicks v. Baines, 593 F.3d 159, 166 (2d Cir. 2010) (alterations in 
original) (quoting Fletcher v. Atex, Inc., 68 F.3d 1451, 1456 (2d Cir. 1995)).

"The same standard[s] appl[y] where, as here, the parties file[] cross-motions for 
summary judgment...." Morales v. Ouintel Entm't. Inc., 249 F.3d 115, 121 (2d Cir. 2001). 
"[W]hen both parties move for summary judgment, asserting the absence of any genuine issues 
of material fact, a court need not enter judgment for either party. Rather, each party's motion 
must be examined on its own merits, and in each case all reasonable inferences must be drawn 
against the party whose motion is under consideration." Id. (internal citations omitted).

Summary Judgment in FOIA Cases 
"Summary judgment is the procedural vehicle by which most FOIA actions are 
resolved." Jones-Edwards v. Appeal Bd. of Nat. Sec. Agency Cent. Sec. Agency, 352 F. Supp. 
2d 420, 423 (S.D.N.Y. 2005). "In order to prevail on a motion for summary judgment in a FOIA 
case, the defending agency has the burden of showing that [1] its search was adequate[,] and [2] 
any withheld documents fall within an exemption to the FOIA." Carney v. U.S. Dept. of Justice 
F.3d 807, 812 (2d Cir. 1994). 
A government agency may sustain its burden through "c[a]ffidavits or 
declarations [that] supply(' facts indicating that the agency has conducted a thorough search and 
[that] giv[e] reasonably detailed explanations why any withheld documents fall within an 
exemption.' Associated Press v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, 2007 WL 737476, at •3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 
7, 2007) (quoting Carney. 19 F.3d at 812); accord Garcia v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, Office of Info. 
& Privacy, 181 F. Supp. 2d 356, 366 (S.D.N.Y. 2002). m[T]he general rule in this Circuit is that 
in FOIA actions, agency affidavits alone will support a grant of summary judgment,' and Local 
Civil Rule 56.1 statements are not required." N.Y. Times Co. v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, 872 F. 
Supp. 2d 309, 314 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (quoting Ferguson v. FBI 1995 WL 329307, at •2 (S.D.N.Y.

presumed to have been made in good faith." Garcia, 181 F. Supp. 2d at 366. 
"[D]iscovery relating to the agency's search and the exemptions it claims for 
withholding records generally is unnecessary if the agency's submissions are adequate on their 
face." Carney, 19 F.3d at 812. "A district court ... may grant summary judgment in favor of an 
agency `on the basis of agency affidavits if they contain reasonable specificity of detail rather 
than merely conclusory statements, and if they are not called into question by contradictory 
evidence in the record or by evidence of agency bad faith."' Grand Cent. P'ship. Inc. v. Cuomo 
166 F.3d 473, 478 (2d Cir. 1999) (emphasis in original) (quoting Gallant v. N.L.R.B., 26 F.3d 
168, 171 (D.C. Cir. 1994)). A plaintiff may avoid summary judgment and obtain discovery 
where, "once the agency has satisfied its burden, the plaintiff ... make[s] a showing of bad faith 
on the part of the agency ... or provide[s] some tangible evidence that an exemption claimed by 
the agency should not apply." Conti v. U.S. Dept. of Homeland Sec., 2014 WL 1274517, at "10

FOIA EXEMPTION 7fAl 
The FBI again argues that all of the withheld records responsive to Plaintiffs' 
FOIA request were properly withheld under Exemption 7(A) to FOIA. (Sc..
 Def. Br. (Dkt. No. 
57) at 10-21; Second Comey Decl. (Dkt. No. 47); Third Comey Decl. (Dkt. No. 59)) Plaintiff 
responds that the FBI's declarations do not link any of the document categories to potential 
harms. (Phi Br. (Dkt. No. 62) at 3-4) According to Plaintiffs, "[w]hile [the FBI declarations] 
now divided the material at issue into a greater number of categories, [they] offerd nothing to 
substantiate how releasing records within that category will likely result in harm." U at 3

A. 
Applicable Law 
Exemption 7(A) to FOIA permits government agencies to withhold "records or 
information compiled for law enforcement purposes" where "the production of such law 
enforcement records or information ... could reasonably be expected to interfere with 
enforcement proceedings." 5 U.S.C. § 552(bX7)(A). "This exemption 'prevent[s] harm to the 
government's case in court by not allowing litigants earlier or greater access to agency 
investigatory files than they would otherwise have.' N.Y. Times Co. v. United States Dept. of 
Justice, 2016 WL 5946711, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 18, 2016) (quoting Conti, 2014 WL 1274517, 
at *22). "Mt' the exemption applies, it `will justify denial of release, not only to the objects of 
the investigation and any pending or prospective enforcement actions, but to third parties as 
well.' Stein v. U.S. Sec. & Exch. Comm'n, 2017 WL 3141903, at *11 (D.D.C. July 24, 2017) 
(quoting Kanter v. IRS, 433 F. Supp. 812, 817 (N.D. Ill. 1977)). 
In order to demonstrate that Exemption 7(A) applies, the government must show 
that (1) "the requested records were compiled for law enforcement purposes," Local 32B-32J, 
Serv. Employees Int'l Union, AFL-CIO v. Gen. Servs. Admin. 1998 WL 726000, at *7 
(S.D.N.Y. Oct. 15, 1998) (internal quotation marks omitted); (2) "a law enforcement proceeding 
is pending or prospective," Amnesty Int'l USA v. C.I.A. 728 F. Supp. 2d 479, 525 (S.D.N.Y. 
2010); and (3) "release of the information could reasonably be expected to cause some 
articulable harm." Id. 
"[A]lthough [courts] give deference to an agency's predictive judgment of the 
harm that will result from disclosure of information, it is not sufficient for the agency to simply 
assert that disclosure will interfere with enforcement proceedings; it must rather demonstrate 
how disclosure will do so." Stein, 2017 WL 3141903, at *9 (quoting Citizens for Responsibility

(emphasis in CREW I). "Ultimately, the government must `allow[ the court to trace a rational 
link between the nature of the document and the alleged likely interference."' N.Y. Times Co., 
2016 WL 5946711, at *7 (quoting Ctr. for Nat'l Sec. Studies v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, 331 F.3d 
918, 940 (D.C. Cir. 2003)). 
B. 
Interference with Law Enforcement Proceedings 
and the Applicability of Exemption 7(A) 
The FBI contends that "the records responsive to the FOIA requests withheld in 
full or in part . 
[a]ll. . . fall within the scope of Exemption 7(A)" (Third Comey Decl. (Dkt. 
No. 59)1i 11), because their "public disclosure ... could reasonably be expected to interfere with 
the pending prosecution of [Ghislaine] Maxwell." all 12) 
In previously denying the FBI summary judgment as to the applicability of 
Exemption 7(A), this Court noted that (1) the Seidel and Comey Declarations submitted in 
support of this request categorized the documents at issue inconsistently; and (2) "the FBI has 
not explicitly linked any of the document categories .. . to the four types of potential harm cited 
in the [First] Comey declaration." (Summary Judgment Order (Dkt. No. 51) at 21) 
The First Comey Declaration grouped the responsive records sought by Plaintiffs 
and withheld by the FBI into three categories: (1) "[i]nterview forms, reports and notes ... of 
interviews with individuals, including victims"; (2) "Federal Grand Jury Subpoenas and 
Subpoenaed information"; and (3) "documents provided by state and local law enforcement 
agencies, 
background information for witnesses . . . and subjects for the investigation[,] 
communications within the FBI [and between the FBI and other agencies] regarding the 
investigation[,] organizational documents, ... the sources from and techniques through which 
EFTA00038661
--- PAGE 11 ---
Case 1:17-cv-03956-PGG Document 64 Filed 06/25/24 Page 11 of 20 
such information and evidence was gathered[,] ... the methods used to analyze the information 
and evidence, ... and the focus of the investigation." (First Comey Decl. (Dkt. No. 39) ¶ 11) 
The First Seidel Declaration — on the other hand — speaks of nine "types of 
responsive recordss3 and three "functional categories of information": 
(1) "Evidentiary/Investigative Materials," including "confidential witness statements" and 
"information exchanged between the FBI and its local law enforcement partners"; 
(2) "Administrative [M]aterials," including internal agency "reporting communications" 
pertaining to an investigation, and other "standardized forms used for a variety of purposes"; and 
(3) "public source material," including news articles and court transcripts which have already 
been "released ... to Plaintiffs." (First Seidel Decl. (Dkt. No. 50) ¶¶ 58-68 (capitalization 
altered)) This Court pointed out that "[t]he document categories in the [First] Seidel 
[D]eclaration and in the [First] Comey Declaration do not match, and documents falling within 
each of the Comey categories likely span multiple categories described by Seidel." (Summary 
Judgment Order (Dkt. No. 51) at 21) 
The FBI now relies on the First Seidel Declaration's three "functional categories 
of information" — (1) Evidentiary/Investigative materials, (2) Administrative Materials, and (3) 
Public Source/Non-Investigative Harm. (First Seidel Decl. (Dkt. No. 50) ¶ 59) — and the Third 
Comey Declaration submitted in support of the FBI's instant motion adopts the same 
categorization. (See Third Comey Decl. (Dkt. No. 59) 13) With the Government's 
(1) "FD-1057 - Electronic Communication"; (2) "Interview Forms (FD-302)"; (3) 
"Handwritten Interview Notes"; (4) "State and Local Law Enforcement Documents"; 
(5) "Documents Implementing Sensitive Investigative Techniques"; (6) "Federal Grand 
Jury Subpoenas/Subpoenaed Information"; (7) "FD-340, IA Envelopes"; (8) "Other 
Investigative Documents"; and (9) "Internet Printouts." (First Seidel Decl. (Dkt. No. 50) 
¶¶ 58-68 (formatting altered)) 
EFTA00038662
--- PAGE 12 ---
Case 1:17-cv-03956-PGG Document 64 Filed 06/25/24 Page 12 of 20 
categorization of responsive documents now consistent, this Court can move on to consider 
whether the FBI has linked these document categories to potential harms and explained how 
those harms could "reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings." 5 U.S.C. 
§ 552(b)(7)(A). 
As to the harm that would result from disclosure, the FBI notes that "the Maxwell 
criminal prosecution is still pending on appeal," and "Ulf the Second Circuit grants Maxwell the 
relief she seeks, there could be a new trial." (Third Comey Decl. (Dkt. No. 59) ¶ 12) 
Accordingly, "public disclosure of the FBI's records relating to the investigation and prosecution 
of Epstein that were withheld in full or in part under Exemption 7(A) could reasonably be 
expected to interfere with the pending prosecution of Maxwell." (11) 
As discussed below, in the FBI's revised declarations filed in support of the 
instant motion, the Bureau now lists the potential harms that may arise from public disclosure, 
and does so as to each category of documents. 
The first category of documents — Evidentiary/Investigative Materials — "includes 
copies of records or evidence, analysis of that evidence, and derivative communications 
summarizing or otherwise referencing evidence." (Third Comey Decl. (Dkt. No. 59) 1 14) This 
category includes business records and "documents and evidence provided by witnesses to law 
enforcement," as well as information regarding those witnesses. ads) 
The second category of documents — Administrative Materials — consists of 
internal communications among investigators within the FBI providing updates 
regarding the status of the investigation, including witness interviews and 
discussion of evidence gathered during the investigation; communications 
between the FBI and other government agencies regarding the investigation; 
grand jury subpoenas identifying the names of witnesses and documents sought 
during the investigation; and organizational documents such as envelopes used to 
organize and store documents and other evidentiary documents, bulky exhibit 
EFTA00038663

Case 1:17-cv-03956-PGG Document 64 Filed 06/25/24 Page 13 of 20 
cover sheets, transmittal forms, and letter routing slips, some of which contain the 
names of witnesses, including victim-witnesses, and subjects of the investigation. 
(al 15) 
As for the harm that would result from disclosure of the Evidentiary/Investigative 
Materials and the Administrative Materials, the FBI states that disclosure would (1) impact 
witness testimony, (2) impact witnesses' willingness to testify, (3) prejudice the jury pool "so as 
to hinder the Government's ability to present its case in court,"4 (4) provide Maxwell with 
greater access "to the investigatory files than she would otherwise have during the criminal 
In connection with its previous summary judgment motion, the FBI described the harm that 
would result from disclosure as "impair[ing] the Government's (and the defendant's) ability to 
seat a fair and impartial jury in Maxwell." (First Comey Decl. (Dkt. No. 39)11 17-19) In 
denying the FBI's motion as to Exemption 7(A), this Court noted that "the FBI's concerns 
regarding the effects of disclosure on jury impartiality are properly raised under Exemption 7(B), 
and not under Exemption 7(A)." (Summary Judgment Order (Dkt. No. 51) at 22 n.10) 
"Exemption 7(B) applies ... when the disclosure of law enforcement records would deprive a 
person of the right to 'a fair trial or an impartial adjudication[,]' ... [and] the word `trial' means 
the ultimate determination of factual and legal claims by judge or jury in a judicial proceeding." 
Chiquita Brands Int'l Inc. v. S.E.C., 805 F.3d 289, 295 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 
5520X70)); M km Washington Post Co. v. U.S. Den't of Just., 863 F.2d 96, 101 (D.C. Cir. 
1988) ("The exemption[] ... was meant to prevent disclosures from conferring an unfair 
advantage upon one party to an adversary proceeding or leading to prejudicial publicity in 
pending cases that might inflame jurors or distort administrative judgment."). 
In connection with its current motion, the FBI states that "the harm the government is 
articulating through a risk of prejudicing the jury pool is the harm of prejudicing the 
government's ability to present its criminal case in court." (Def. Br. (Dkt. No. 57) at 17-18 
(emphasis in original)) In this regard, the Government states that because the "majority of 
records in this category ... were not admitted into evidence at Maxwell's first trial[,] ... the jury 
may wonder why those materials were absent from the trial and may suspect the government of 
trying to hide evidence from the jury, causing jurors to draw an unwarranted adverse inference 
against the government." (U. at 16 (citing Third Comey Decl. (Dkt. No. 59) ¶ 14(c))) 
Accordingly, the harm now identified by the FBI is not prejudice to the parties' right to a fair and 
impartial jury, but instead unfair prejudice to the Government in presenting its case. This type of 
potential harm is properly raised under Exemption 7(A). 
EFTA00038664

Case 1:17-cv-03956-PGG Document 64 Filed 06/25/24 Page 14 of 20 
discovery process," and (5) violate the Protective Order entered in the underlying case. (a.% 
14(a)-(e), 15(a)-(d)) 
In response, Plaintiffs renew their argument that the FBI has not linked the 
document categories to any potential harm. (Pkf. Br. (Dkt. No. 62) at 3) According to Plaintiffs, 
"the FBI insists that these are simply the kinds of documents that would tend to cause harm if 
released, without engaging the reality on the ground that the target of the investigation has seen 
millions of records and was convicted in one of the most high-profile trials in U.S. history." 0j) 
Plaintiffs also point out that "there is no new substantive factual information offered" in the 
revised declarations or the FBI's current motion for summary judgment. adj 
The standard for application of Exemption 7(A) is not whether the "target of the 
investigation has seen millions of records," however, or whether an agency has proffered 
"substantive factual information" in support of a claimed exemption. Instead, an agency "must 
explain to the court how the release of each category would interfere with enforcement 
proceedings." Tipograph v. Dept of Just., 83 F. Supp. 3d 234, 239 (D.D.C. 2015) (quoting 
Bevis v. Dep't of State 801 F.2d 1386, 1389-90 (D.C.Cir. 1986)). "The agency need not justify 
the withholding of each document with specific facts," however. Robbins Geller Rudman & 
Dowd LLP v. United States Sec. & Exch. Comm'n, 419 F. Supp. 3d 523, 530 (E.D.N.Y. 2019). 
Instead, the agency need only make a showing that "allow[s] the court to be able to `trace a 
rational link between the nature of the document and the alleged likely interference?" Id. 
(quoting N.Y. Times Co., 2016 WL 5946711, at *7). 
The FBI has met that burden here. Unlike in its previous motion ( e Summary 
Judgment Order (Dkt. No. 51) at 22-23), the FBI has described the contents of each category and 
linked specific harms that would result from the public disclosure of the documents in each 
EFTA00038665
--- PAGE 15 ---
Case 1:17-cv-03956-PGG Document 64 Filed 06/25/24 Page 15 of 20 
category. For example, the FBI has explained that public disclosure of the 
Evidentiary/Investigative Materials "could influence the testimony of witnesses by providing the 
opportunity for witnesses to shape their testimony to conform with other evidence gathered 
during the investigation, including both records and witness statements." (Third Comey Decl. 
(Dkt. No. 59) ¶ 14(a)) Disclosure of the Evidentiary/Investigative Materials could also have a 
chilling effect on witnesses because "Mhe public release of this information could lead to the 
identification and intimidation of witnesses, who may decline to cooperate with the parties and 
be disinclined to testify if their personal information is released to the public." (&l. ¶ 14(b)) 
Public disclosure could also cause unfair prejudice to the Government at a retrial, based on the 
fact that certain documents were available to the Government but not offered at the first trial. 
Finally, public disclosure would provide Maxwell with greater access to investigatory materials 
than she would otherwise have. a ¶¶ 14(c)-(e), 15(a)-(d)) 
"Ultimately, an agency's justification for invoking a FOIA exemption is sufficient 
if it appears logical or plausible." Larson v. Dev't of State 565 F.3d 857, 862 (D.C. Cir. 2009) 
(internal citation and quotations omitted). Given the information contained within each category, 
and the potential harm that could result from public disclosure — as described in the Second 
Seidel Declaration and the Third Comey Declaration — the FBI has adequately demonstrated the 
necessary logical and plausible connection between disclosure and harm. 
Plaintiffs argue, however, that 
(1) much of the evidence is already the subject of public record from the prior 
trial and other civil proceedings; (2) much of the evidence is otherwise in the 
public domain; and (3) the government makes no effort to segregate this material 
or particularize how the exposure of this material would influence witness 
testimony. 
(Pltf. Br. (Dkt. No. 62) at 3) 
EFTA00038666
--- PAGE 16 ---
Case 1:17-cv-03956-PGG Document 64 Filed 06/25/24 Page 16 of 20 
The FBI has explained, however, that the exhibits admitted at trial "represent a 
small fraction of the documents contained in [the Evidentiary/Investigative Materials] category." 
The Government further represents that it "has made available to the press upon request copies 
of all publicly admitted exhibits from the trial" and is willing to "provide a copy of those 
publicly filed exhibits to the Plaintiffs upon request." (Third Comey Decl. (Dkt. No. 59)11 14(f)) 
In connection with the instant FOIA application, the FBI has also reviewed responsive records 
"on a document-by-document basis" (Second Seidel Decl. (Mt. No. 58) at 2) and has separated 
"publicly available news reporting and other open source materials that are already accessible 
online through public sources" into a third category that "ha[s] already been produced to 
Plaintiffs." (Third Comey Decl. (Dkt. No. 59)1116) Finally, "an agency may satisfy its burden 
of proof `by grouping documents in categories and offering generic reasons for withholding the 
documents in each category.' CREW I.746 F.3d at 1098 (quoting Maydak, 218 F.3d at 765). 
Where an agency 
wishes to adopt the generic approach, [it] has a three-fold task. First, it must 
define its categories functionally. Second, it must conduct a document-by-
document review in order to assign documents to the proper category. Finally, it 
must explain to the court how the release of each category would interfere with 
enforcement proceedings. 
j4, 746 F.3d at 1098 (quoting Bevis, 801 F.2d at 1389-90). As discussed above, the FBI has 
"defined its categories fimctionally"; it has performed "a document-by-document review in order 
to assign documents to the proper category"; and it has explained how the disclosure of each 
category would interfere with enforcement proceedings. 
In connection with the harm element, the FBI has explained that the public 
disclosure of the materials at issue could influence witness testimony by "providing the 
opportunity for witnesses to shape their testimony to conform with [what is set forth in the non-
public records]." (Third Comey Decl. (Dkt. No. 59) ¶¶ 14(a), 15(a)) "Courts allow withholding 
EFTA00038667
--- PAGE 17 ---
Case 1:17-cv-03956-PGG Document 64 Filed 06/25/24 Page 17 of 20 
under Exemption 7(A) [where] . . . `[p]ublic disclosure of information could result in destruction 
of evidence, chilling and intimidation of witnesses, and revelation of the scope and nature of the 
Government's investigation.' Tipograph, 83 F. Supp. 3d at 239 (quoting Solar Sources. Inc. v. 
United States, 142 F.3d 1033, 1039 (7th Cir. 1998)). Indeed, "Exemption 7 was designed to 
prevent harm to the government's case in court by not allowing litigants earlier or greater access 
to agency investigatory files than they would otherwise have." oC nti, 2014 WL 1274517, at *22 
(citing Robbins Tire & Rubber Co., 437 U.S. at 224-25); see also New York Times, 2016 WL 
5946711, at 4'13 ("Such explanations are sufficient to establish that the withholdings conceal 
records compiled for law enforcement purposes that disclose techniques and procedures for law 
enforcement investigations, and, therefore, justify nondisclosure."). 
These paradigmatic harms are among the harms that the FBI now alleges would 
result from disclosure of the Evidentiary/Investigative Materials and the Administrative 
Materials. While the FBI previously failed to link these potential harms to each document 
category, it has now done so. There is no need for the FBI to further "particularize how the 
exposure of this material would influence witness testimony." (PItt Br. (Dkt. No. 62) at 3) 
"[T]he record establishes that the release of the requested information could reasonably be 
expected to cause articulable harm." Cui v. Fed. Bureau of Investigation 551 F. Supp. 3d 4, 24 
(E.D.N.Y. 2021) 
This Court concludes that "[t]he [revised] declarations provide[] sufficient detail 
for the Court to trace a rational link between the information contained in the records and the 
potential interference with law enforcement proceedings," id. at 24, and the FBI has thus met its 
burden for withholding disclosure of the records under Exemption 7(A). Because "Exemption 
EFTA00038668
--- PAGE 18 ---
Case 1:17-cv-03956-PGG Document 64 Filed 06/25/24 Page 18 of 20 
7(A) continues to be accerted to protect all redacted information," (Second Seidel Decl. (Dkt. No. 
58)1 8), this Court need not evaluate the applicability of the other Exemptions. 
SEGREGABILITY 
"FOIA 
. provides that [a]ny reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be 
provided to any person requesting such record after deletion of the portions which are exempt.' 
Conti, 2014 WL 1274517, at *25 (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 552(6)). "[T]he agency must provide a 
detailed justification for its decision that non-exempt material is not segregable," but "is entitled 
to a presumption that it complied with its obligation to disclose reasonably segregable material." 
Id. (citing Mead Data Cent., Inc. v. U.S. Dept. of Air Force 566 F.2d 242, 261 (D.C. Cir. 1977)). 
"[T]o justify withholding an entire document[,] the DOJ ... must demonstrate that [it] cannot 
delineate between exempt and non-exempt information therein." Avvad v. U.S. Dept. of Justice 
2002 WL 654133, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 18, 2002). 
Here, the FBI states that it has reviewed responsive records on a "document-by-
document basis" and conducted a segregability review concerning 11,571 responsive pages. 
(Second Seidel Decl. (Dkt. No. 58) at 2, 20-21). The FBI further represents that "to the extent 
there is non-exempt information contained in the records withheld under Exemption 7(A), that 
information is intertwined with exempt information and cannot reasonably be segregated without 
risking interference with the Maxwell prosecution, referencing the harms described 
[previously]." (Def. Br. (Dkt. No. 57) at 30; Third Comey Decl. (Dkt. No. 59) ¶ 17) According 
to the FBI, "[t]he media coverage of speculation and theories about Maxwell's association with 
Epstein makes the segregation of any possibly non-exempt information particularly difficult 
because providing information pertaining to Epstein without complete context can reasonably be 
EFTA00038669
--- PAGE 19 ---
Case 1:17-cv-03956-PGG Document 64 Filed 06/25/24 Page 19 of 20 
expected to contribute to the dissemination of speculation and theories about the Maxwell case." 
(Third Comey Decl. (Dkt. No. 59) ¶ 17) 
"An agency's explanation that records are exempt in their entirety is sufficient to 
satisfy its segregability obligations with respect to the documents withheld under Exemption 
7(A)." New York Times Co. v. United States Dep't of Just., 390 F. Supp. 3d 499, 519 (S.D.N.Y. 
2019); Stein v. U.S. Sec. & Exch. Comm'n 266 F. Supp. 3d 326, 353 (D.D.C. 2017) ("[T]he 
SEC has sufficiently described two categories of documents that it has withheld under 
Exemption 7(A) in their entirety, and explained that it is not possible to segregate non-exempt 
information from these documents, except as the Court has described above. This is sufficient to 
satisfy the agency's segregability obligations with respect to the documents withheld under 
Exemption 7(A)."); Dillon v. Dep't of Just., 102 F. Supp. 3d 272, 298 (D.D.C. 2015) (concluding 
that the FBI satisfied its segregability obligation under FOIA by stating that it had "carefully 
reviewed the material withheld" and explained that "segregability is not possible because [the 
records] are exempt from disclosure [in their entirety] pursuant to Exemption 7(A)" (second 
alteration in original)). This Court concludes that the FBI has satisfied its segregability burden 
with respect to the documents withheld in full under Exemption 7(A).

just now, would you please put together a photobook for us to show to trial 
witnesses with photos and fillers for the following individuals? 
. Epstein

As I mentioned to

I
think it would be ideal to get formal photos like from a license or passport from the late 1990s or 
early 2000s for each of these individuals. That way we can use the NYPD database to find fillers who appear similar.

Hi 
here. 
is in an extensive meeting 
with DCF. She has been given the 
ultimatum of the case or leaving her 
children. This new case has caused 
her to relapse and we are sending 
her to trauma therapy. She is not 
mentally able to handle the case 
and issues with her children right 
now. Maybe in a month we can try 
again. But, I am kindly asking that I 
be notified so I can prepare her. I 
apologize for any inconvenience. 
Any questions, please feel free to 
reach out to me. I am a protector of 
my children, more so when they are 
in a crisis situation.

Is this something a lawyer is needed for? Sony I have never had to do something like this. I saw the 
subpoena mentioned I could but wasn't sure if it was necessary or not.

Hello M, 
Was nice speaking with you earlier and wishing you a speedy recovery from your oral 
surgery. I will contact the prosecutors on the case and see what everyone's availability is for 
the next couple of weeks and we will go from there. If you decide that you prefer to have 
Sigrid involved that is fine just have her reach out to either myself or the prosecutors.

We have a bit of a conflict in timing on our end that I did not initially realize for next Friday. I do 
apologize but is there any chance you can speak with us earlier that morning (around 10-11am New 
York time) instead of 2pm? Are you still living in Arizona? If this is too early we can also try and 
arrange some other timing during the week if you know your work schedule better by now. I don't 
expect our conversation to be much more than an hour. 
Sony again and please let me know,

Good morning 
I apologize for the delayed response on this. By all means your attorney is welcome on this call. In 
fact if this your preference we will reschedule until he is available to be a part of it. We can do a call 
today anytime from 3PM on into the evening if that works for him. Also most anytime tomorrow works 
for us. If you or he has any questions feel free to have him call me directly by cell.

Hi 
Glad things have calmed down a bit for you. 
In general I think it's best for everyone to do this over video conference. It's the fastest and 
safest way for us to connect in these times. 
You will not require any special technology or apps to connect. If you have a smart phone or any 
computer with a camera/ webcam that will work. We will send you a secure email link which will 
open right up in your web browser. There is an option to download an app on your phone but it's 
not necessary. 
I will check with the rest of the team on connecting with you either tomorrow, Monday or 
Thursday. Mornings work best for you? How's 10 am work on any of those days?

The email says we can have a video conference for a few hours. What type of 
video/computer capability would I need? 
Would you rather I speak with Grand Jury in NYC? Do to Covid, I'd rather not come 
up. 
Can I meet with the FBI in DC instead? 
And, if it's possible to do a zoom meeting, I'll be at my computer tomorrow, Monday 
and Thursday morning. Please let me know ASAP as I have to arrange my 
schedule.

Hi 
Again I'm sorry to hear about your family issues. We also totally understand the need to 
want to do this interview in the safest possible way. 
Unfortunately you still remain an important witness to this investigation and it is becoming 
time sensitive. That being said we are issuing you the attached Grand Jury Subpoena to 
speak with us. In lieu of appearing in a Grand Jury in New York on the listed time and date 
we are still ok with you blocking off a few hours to speak with us over video conference 
sometime in near future. 
Please see attached to the subpoena your Advice of Rights.

Ok great. The prosecutors on the case will send out an email invite to you for the meeting which will 
include them, myself and another agent. There will be a link in the email with instructions how to join 
the meeting. 
In my experience it's generally easier if you have a laptop with a camera. When you open the email 
you will have the option to just click on a link which will open the meeting up in your web browser. 
If you choose to do it in your phone the link in your email may prompt you to download "cisco WebEx" 
app. 
Either way we can walk you through it on Monday. See you then.

Was nice speaking with you earlier and wishing you a speedy 
recovery from your oral surgery. I will contact the prosecutors 
on the case and see what everyone's availability is for the next 
couple of weeks and we will go from there. If you decide that 
you prefer to have Sigrid involved that is fine just have her 
reach out to either myself or the prosecutors. 
Thanks again,

I've thought about it, and I think I'd like to hear what the lawyers say before I I agree to an interview, 
and for me to ask some questions etc. 
I am available in the morning on Thursday at 6am TX time, or tomorrow morning at 11am TX time, or I 
can do a Wednesday morning time if those don't work? 
Thanks!

Hi M, 
I'm on vacation with my husband now, and think in the next couple of weeks it will be a 
problem because my first cousin (who is like a sister) is in hospice. So sad as she is so 
young. 
The last week of January should be fine. Do you you have time then?

My client has been in contact regarding the possibility of an interview to take place in London. Please

I very much look forward to hearing from you in order that we may set up a convenient time for you to

is for the next couple of weeks and we will go from there. If you decide that you prefer 
to have Sigrid involved that is fine just have her reach out to either myself or the 
prosecutors. 
Thanks again,

I apologize for the delayed response on this. By all means your attorney is 
welcome on this call. In fact if this your preference we will reschedule until he is 
available to be a part of it. We can do a call today anytime from 3PM on into the

So sorry to hear about your cousin. This interview can certainly wait until the last week of January. 
Take this time to be with her and enjoy your vacation. 
Let's schedule a date for that week and I'll send out a calendar invite. How's Tuesday the 26th in the 
afternoon work for you? Feel free to throw out another day or time if that's no good. As of now we 
are mostly available that week.

Hi M, 
I'm on vacation with my husband now, and think in the next couple of weeks it will be a 
problem because my first cousin (who is like a sister) is in hospice. So sad as she is so 
young. 
The last week of January should be fine. Do you you have time then? 
Thanks,

day to aim for. Lets try for 1PM. I will have the prosecutors send out a calendar invite

Hello 
I've spoken with the team they are going to available on Monday afternoon at 5:30 for a 
meeting with you. I know you had mentioned being in New York that day and meeting with 
us in person but as of now it will work best for our team to conduct a virtual interview. If 
you are comfortable with that we can schedule you for 5:30 PM on Monday 1/11. You

Was nice speaking with you earlier and wishing you a speedy recovery from your oral

to have Sigrid involved that is fine just have her reach out to either myself or the

Again I'm sorry to hear about your family issues. We also totally understand the need to want to do 
this interview in the safest possible way. 
Unfortunately you still remain an important witness to this investigation and it is becoming time 
sensitive. That being said we are issuing you the attached Grand Jury Subpoena to speak with us. In 
lieu of appearing in a Grand Jury in New York on the listed time and date we are still ok with you 
blocking off a few hours to speak with us over video conference sometime in near future.

Hi 
Glad things have calmed down a bit for you. 
In general I think it's best for everyone to do this over video conference. It's the fastest and 
safest way for us to connect in these times. 
You will not require any special technology or apps to connect. If you have a smart phone or any 
computer with a camera/ webcam that will work. We will send you a secure email link which will 
open right up in your web browser. There is an option to download an app on your phone but it's 
not necessary. 
I will check with the rest of the team on connecting with you either tomorrow, Monday or

Unfortunately you still remain an important witness to this investigation and it is becoming

My client has been in contact regarding the possibility of an interview to take place in London. Please 
note that my client is entitled to automatic anonymity under UK Statute as herself a victim of sexual 
assault that occurred in the UK and she does not waive her right to that anonymity. 
I very much look forward to hearing from you in order that we may set up a convenient time for you to

A call may be a good idea.

Was nice speaking with you earlier and wishing you a speedy recovery from 
your oral surgery. I will contact the prosecutors on the case and see what 
everyone's availability is for the next couple of weeks and we will go from

have her reach out to either myself or the prosecutors.

day and meeting with us in person but as of now it will work best for our team 
to conduct a virtual interview. If you are comfortable with that we can 
schedule you for 5:30 PM on Monday 1/11. You would receive email 
instructions on how to log into the secure video line from either your cell 
phone of computer. 
Please let me know and thanks again,

Hi 
Again I'm sorry to hear about your family issues. We also totally understand the need to want to do 
this interview in the safest possible way. 
Unfortunately you still remain an important witness to this investigation and it is becoming time 
sensitive. That being said we are issuing you the attached Grand Jury Subpoena to speak with us. In 
lieu of appearing in a Grand Jury in New York on the listed time and date we are still ok with you 
blocking off a few hours to speak with us over video conference sometime in near future. 
Please see attached to the subpoena your Advice of Rights. 
Thanks again,

Hello 
Was nice speaking with you earlier and wishing you a speedy recovery from your 
oral surgery. I will contact the prosecutors on the case and see what everyone's 
availability is for the next couple of weeks and we will go from there. If you decide 
that you prefer to have Sigrid involved that is fine just have her reach out to either 
myself or the prosecutors.

Hi 
Glad things have calmed down a bit for you. 
In general I think its best for everyone to do this over video conference. It's the fastest and safest 
way for us to connect in these times. 
You will not require any special technology or apps to connect. If you have a smart phone or any 
computer with a camera/ webcam that will work. We will send you a secure email link which will open 
right up in your web browser. There is an option to download an app on your phone but it's not 
necessary. 
I will check with the rest of the team on connecting with you either tomorrow, Monday or Thursday. 
Mornings work best for you? How's 10 am work on any of those days?

Good morning M, 
Things have calmed down a bit here and I have time to get back to you. 
A couple of questions: 
The email says we can have a video conference for a few hours. What type of 
video/computer capability would I need? 
Would you rather I speak with Grand Jury in NYC? Do to Covid, I'd rather not come up. 
Can I meet with the FBI in DC instead? 
And, if it's possible to do a zoom meeting, I'll be at my computer tomorrow, Monday and 
Thursday morning. Please let me know ASAP as I have to arrange my schedule. 
Thanks,

Hi 
Hope you're doing well. Do you have up-to-date copies of the tracking spreadsheets for the tipline/hotlines for Maxwell 
and Epstein that you could please send to me as soon as possible? I think the last ones we have from FBI are from last 
summer (one of which is attached) so just want to do extra due diligence on my end to make sure we have what we need 
to produce in 3500. If you could send those spreadsheets as soon as possible, that would be great.

Good Afternoon SA 
I'm a Unit Chief within the FOIA program and handle program coordination with other government

inadvertently released as part of a FAA FOIA production. Prior to FAA's inadvertent release, FAA had

Subject: [EXTERNAL EMAIL] - FOIA requests that seek historical flight data for Jeffrey Epstein aircraft 
Importance: High 
The FAA has previously received FOIA requests seeking historical flight data for aircraft owned or operated by Jeffrey 
Epstein, specifically N908JE, N909JE, N212JE, and N120JE and these are FOIA requests for which we have consulted with 
the FBI. One of those requesters, Angela Wang from Business Insider, submitted two requests in 2020 that sought the 
flight records for those four aircraft from January 1, 1990 to July 6, 2019. Both times, she was denied those records under 
exemption 7A because of the FBI's criminal investigation. Ms. Wang recently published an article (see link below) in which 
she references another FOIA request which sought all aircraft flights that are stored in the FAA Traffic Flow Management

Good Afternoon SA 
I'm a Unit Chief within the FOIA program and handle program coordination with other government 
agencies. We received the below forwarded email from FAA detailing FAA flight records that were 
inadvertently released as part of a FAA FOR production. Prior to FAA's inadvertent release, FAA had 
been withholding all Epstein flight data per our request. We wanted to make you aware of the 
situation as you are listed as case agent in the 50D investigation. Please advise if I can do anything to 
assist.

Subject: (EXTERNAL EMAIL) - FOIA requests that seek historical flight data for Jeffrey Epstein aircraft 
Importance: High 
The FAA has previously received FOIA requests seeking historical flight data for aircraft owned or operated by Jeffrey 
Epstein, specifically N9081E, N9091E, N212JE, and N120JE and these are FOIA requests for which we have consulted with 
the FBI. One of those requesters, Angela Wang from Business Insider, submitted two requests in 2020 that sought the 
flight records for those four aircraft from January 1, 1990 to July 6, 2019. Both times, she was denied those records under 
exemption 7A because of the FBI's criminal investigation. Ms. Wang recently published an article (see link below) in which 
she references another FOIA request which sought all aircraft flights that are stored in the FAA Traffic Flow Management 
System (TFMS) repository, which is where the FAA stores historical flight data. The records that were released in response 
to that FOIA request inadvertently included flights involving N9081E, N9091E, N212JE, and N120JE. We have implemented 
measures to keep flight data from being released for N908JE, N909JE, N212JE, and N120JE in response to future FOIA 
requests that seek the entire TFMS repository.

Hi Erica - since these are all handled through USCIS we really are unable to speak on the best route. I would speak to an 
Immigration Attorney who routinely works these types of cases; they would have a better idea the number of visas 
approved each year and the timeframe. 
I could connect you someone at Legal Aid who works on these all of the time- would you like me to connect you to her?

Ms.

It was brought to our attention that

our understanding, Ms. 
gave a shining picture of Ms. Maxwell, and claimed that she was only at 
Epstein's residence once in the years she worked for him. 
According to Ms. =, 
however, from 2001-2002, when she was 14-15 years old, in addition to 
Ms.

follow upon arrival. She would then see Ms.

Ms. 
dropped her lawsuit against Ms.

of her settlement with the Epstein Estate. 
I hope this information is useful.

Subject: [EXTERNAL] Maxwell 
I have issued the following statement in response to multiple press inquires: 
The conviction of Ghislaine Maxwell is a welcome confirmation of the veracity of the charges brought against her on 
behalf of the very brave young women whom she directly participated in abusing. Speaking for the women I have been 
privileged to represent over the past decade, I thank the prosecutors of the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of 
New York for their unwavering dedication to achieving justice in this case, and I express my confidence in their continued 
dedication. 
Satisfaction with Maxwell's conviction is tempered by the knowledge that other co-conspirators have yet to be held 
responsible for their involvement in Jeffrey Epstein's extraordinary criminal enterprise. Doors closed by Epstein's death 
may be opened by the very strong motivation Maxwell now has to unlock every door to which she holds a key.

Thank you so much for the praise about the case and conviction. It's been a very long 3 years for us since we opened the 
case, but we're glad it's over. We've been getting many calls of congratulations tonight, largely from victims of Maxwell 
and Epstein. It's a great end to the case and closure for everyone involved. 
Hope for a large sentence for her to come soon.

Good evening-
Regarding the list of numbers to be queried in Relativity I've completed the first 4. There are several "hits" but not all are 
exact matches and need to be sorted through. 
I organized the info in a Word Doc reflecting results under the first section US vs Epstein as "JE" and the second part with 
the search warrants as "JE SW". Each positive match has the control number and a brief description of what it consists of. 
As I continue to work on it I will send it with updated results. 
Thanks, 
EFTA00038940

Hi 
Hope you're doing well. Do you have up-to-date copies of the tracking spreadsheets for the tipline/hotlines for Maxwell 
and Epstein that you could please send to me as soon as possible? I think the last ones we have from FBI are from last 
summer (one of which is attached) so just want to do extra due diligence on my end to make sure we have what we need 
to produce in 3500. If you could send those spreadsheets as soon as possible, that would be great.

Hey ME 
and 
would like the emails for the SDNY leads in the updated Maxwell hotline spreadsheet. I've made a USAfx 
folder for them to be uploaded to, since it's probably too many to send via email: 
If you could please help us get these together as soon as possible, that would be really helpful.

Hi 
I hope you're all well! I just added you to a "Maxwell Amazon Records" folder on USAfx, linked here: 
https://usafx.box.com/s/xwzacvolpqw1929zi5b0q9lxkg9e0zh4
I uploaded two zip files — one entitled "Original Returns" and one entitled "SDNY_GM_00000966-976 (Amazon)". The 
original returns are the returns in their original format as we received them, and the SDNY folder contains the converted 
and Bates stamped versions of those original files. They are identical, but I uploaded them (a) for your reference and (b) 
because the Bates stamped versions are not password protected, making them easier to quickly review. 
Thanks very much! If you have any issues, please let me know.

Dear 
Been a while, so I hope you're well these days! I wanted to send a quick email because our office is nominating the 
Epstein / Maxwell case for a Director's Award in the category of Superior Performance by a Litigation Team. Doing a 
nomination for that award in particular allows the office to include law enforcement partners as well, so we're thrilled to 
have the full team in the application, including in recognition of your extensive efforts with victims. I've reached out to 
and M, and so also wanted to ask you if you could please either email, or give me a quick call to tell me, your: 
• DOB 
• Last four of SSN 
• Your GS scale 
• Whether you've won any DOJ or other professional awards in the past three years 
That's all! I'm reachable anytime at this email or by phone at 
. If it's possible to chat today, that would be 
great, or if not then whenever you're able.

OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell....[*** See this Opinion & Order ***]... V. Conclusion. 
For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the Defendant's Rule 29 motion because the jury's 
guilty verdicts were supported by the witness testimony and documentary evidence presented 
at trial. The Court denies the Defendant's motion based on constructive amendment or 
EFTA00038962
--- PAGE 2 ---
variance because the jury instructions, the Government's evidence at trial, and summation all 
captured the core of criminality charged in the Indictment, and the Defendant was not 
prejudiced by any alleged variance. Further, because the Government neither intentionally 
delayed its prosecution nor was the Defendant prejudiced by any delay, the Court also denies 
the Defendant's motion based on pre-indictment delay. Finally, the Court grants the 
Defendant's motion as to multiplicity. The Government concedes that Count One is 
multiplicitous with Count Three, and the Court further concludes that Count Five is 
multiplicitous with Count Three. Count Five, like Counts One and Three, charged the 
Defendant's participation in the same decade-long unlawful agreement with the Defendant's 
continuous coconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein, to groom and sexually abuse underage girls. 
Accordingly, the Court will enter judgment of conviction on Counts Three, Four, and Six. The 
Defendant's sentencing date remains scheduled for June 28, 2022. The Court previously set a 
schedule for sentencing submissions that remains in effect. Dkt. No. 656. This resolves Dkt.

Dear 
Been a while, so I hope you're well these days! I wanted to send a quick email because our office is nominating the 
Epstein / Maxwell case for a Director's Award in the category of Superior Performance by a Litigation Team. Doing a 
nomination for that award in particular allows the office to include law enforcement partners as well, so we're thrilled to 
have the full team in the application, including in recognition of your extensive efforts with victims. I've reached out to 
and M, and so also wanted to ask you if you could please either email, or give me a quick call to tell me, your: 
• DOB 
• Last four of SSN 
• Your GS scale 
• Whether you've won any DOJ or other professional awards in the past three years 
That's all! I'm reachable anytime at this email or by phone at 
. If it's possible to chat today, that would be 
great, or if not then whenever you're able. 
thanks again,

HIM, 
It's been a while and seems like things on this case worked out where some of the people who should be locked 
up are locked up. 
I'm wondering if you know of a way I could ever talk to Ghislaine who's in prison. I have questions and words, 
and while don't assume there'd be closure for me in asking her these questions and talking to her, I'm hoping it 
might do something in my heart at least. 
Do you know if or how these things would even work if possible in the first place? 
I don't have the spare cash or time to fly to NY, but even if I did, is that how one would go about talking to 
someone like that in prison? So so out of my wheelhouse of things I'd ever considered even thinking about... 
I apologize for not testifying. I was afraid and didn't want my name more associated with them than it was, and 
I'd spent a long time trying to distance myself from it all...not that that works fully but it was what I was capable 
of at the time. Still. I'm sorry. 
Thanks,

Dear Special Agent 
As you have apparently heard from AUSA 
=I, 
we represent one of the two co-executors of the 
Estate of Jeffrey Epstein. Hughes Hubbard & Reed represents the other. Recently, we have been responding to 
requests/demands for documents in connection with a settlement that the Estate entered into with the 
Government of the U.S. Virgin Islands and in response to subpoenas issued in litigations pending before the 
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The Estate is not a party to the SDNY litigation. 
As part of the Estate's document production obligations, we are reviewing approximately 1,100 videos that 
were pulled from Epstein's emails and other files. Because of the potential existence of child pornography in 
those videos, we worked out a protocol with the parties to whom we owed document production obligations, 
and that protocol gave our reviewers protection and comfort in undertaking the review. The protocol was 
EFTA00038999
--- PAGE 4 ---
submitted to the SDNY Court (Judge Jed Rakoff), who signed the "Order regarding Review of 
Videomaterials." (Attached). 
During the review yesterday, our co-counsel at Hughes Hubbard came across a video that may contain child 
pornography. Apparently the relevant video was shared with Epstein by an individual who was convicted of a 
child pornography-type offense and i•Ield 
one or two topless women. In an abundance of caution, we 
halted the review and reached out to 
. Co-counsel at Hughes Hubbard (Dan Weiner and Hilary 
McDonnell) can correct any misstatements in my description of the review since I heard the account 
secondhand. 
We would appreciate any guidance that you may have. We have been careful not to download videos to the 
respective law firms' servers, but the videos were processed (without review) by a document collection vendor. 
Thanks and we look forward to hearing from you.

Subject: [EXTERNAL EMAIL] - Epstein Estate 
Dear Special Agent 
As you have apparently heard from AUSA 
=I, 
we represent one of the two co-executors of the 
Estate of Jeffrey Epstein. Hughes Hubbard & Reed represents the other. Recently, we have been responding to 
requests/demands for documents in connection with a settlement that the Estate entered into with the 
Government of the U.S. Virgin Islands and in response to subpoenas issued in litigations pending before the 
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The Estate is not a party to the SDNY litigation. 
As part of the Estate's document production obligations, we are reviewing approximately 1,100 videos that 
were pulled from Epstein's emails and other files. Because of the potential existence of child pornography in 
those videos, we worked out a protocol with the parties to whom we owed document production obligations, 
and that protocol gave our reviewers protection and comfort in undertaking the review. The protocol was 
submitted to the SDNY Court (Judge Jed Rakoff), who signed the "Order regarding Review of 
Videomaterials." (Attached). 
During the review yesterday, our co-counsel at Hughes Hubbard came across a video that may contain child 
pornography. Apparently the relevant video was shared with Epstein by an individual who was convicted of a 
child pornography-type offense and iliad 
one or two topless women. In an abundance of caution, we 
halted the review and reached out to 
. Co-counsel at Hughes Hubbard (Dan Weiner and Hilary 
McDonnell) can correct any misstatements in my description of the review since I heard the account 
secondhand. 
We would appreciate any guidance that you may have. We have been careful not to download videos to the 
respective law firms' servers, but the videos were processed (without review) by a document collection vendor. 
Thanks and we look forward to hearing from you. 
Best, 
Daniel Ruzumna

Hi a

been non stop traveling for work. Fm in new Orleans till Friday for training. Let me call the case agent to see if 
she has a copy of the ovs/fbi form that she could send you. 
I'm out on vacation next week but when I'm at my desk I do want to go over one taste and anything else you may 
need from me. 
Thank you for all of your help with one taste too. Did you see there was an arrest made on this case?

Good AfternoorS, 
I am still in need of an FBI Verification form for the above victim. We spoke briefly about her before. You were 
able to confirm that she was a vetted victim of Epstein. If you get a chance, can you please send that over?
