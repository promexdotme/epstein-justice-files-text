Been a while since we last corresponded — we hope you're well, given the circumstances of the world. We wanted to 
reach out because we served a subpoena on Amazon on June 12, and we'd like to ask to expedite the response, at least as 
to shipping / delivery information for the relevant individual. The subpoena is attached for your reference, and it would 
be extraordinarily helpful if we could get at least that information by the end of the week (which is the deadline on the 
subpoena, though obviously we ordinarily are understanding of some additional time being necessary). Please let us 
know? And we're happy to discuss if that would be useful. 
thanks,

GHISLAINE MAXWELL CHARGED IN MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURT FOR 
CONSPIRING WITH JEFFREY EPSTEIN TO SEXUALLY ABUSE MINORS 
Maxwell is Alleged to Have Facilita- ted, Participated in Acts of Abuse 
Additionally Charged With Perjury in Connection With 2016 Depositions 
Audrey Strauss, the Acting United States Attorney- for the Southern District of New York, William F. 
Sweeney Jr., the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation ("FBI"), and Dermot Shea, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department ("NYPD"), 
announced that GHISLANE MAXWELL was arrested this morning and charged with enticing a minor to travel 
to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, 
conspiracy to commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. The Indictment 
unsealed today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 through 1997, MAXWELL and co-conspirator 
Jeffrey Epstein exploited girls as young as 14, including by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the 
purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference for young girls, 
MAXWELL played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations 
including New York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, MAXWELL made several false 
statements in sworn depositions in 2016. MAXWELL is expected to be presented this afternoon in the in federal 
court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan. 
Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated, aided, and 
participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then 
delivered them into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust. 
EFTA00017713
--- PAGE 2 ---
All the while, she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself. 
Today, after many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the 
most important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the 
law and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth into 
behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the quest for 
justice has been met with great disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. The 
example set by the women involved has been a powerful one. They persevered against the rich and connected, 
and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a subpoena - and they stood together. I have no doubt the bravery 
exhibited by the women involved here has empowered others to speak up about the crimes of which they've been 
subjected." 
NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said: "The heinous crimes these charges allege are, and always will 
be abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement 
partners, for their continuing commitment to bringing justice to the survivors of sexual assault, everywhere." 
If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, please contact 
the FBI at 1-800-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
According to the Indictment[l I unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated 
in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, 
which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies or 
taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at 
ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. 
Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to accept offers of 
financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. MAXWELL also 
normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, encouraging them to massage 
Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and 
susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between 
minor victims and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL 
was present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages 
during which a minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein 
involving a minor victim where MAXWELL was present. 
As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching 
of a victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to 
touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and 
Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as 
well as MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
EFTA00017714
--- PAGE 3 ---
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal 
sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to 
travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of 
transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, which carries a maximum sentence of 
years in prison, one count of conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual 
activity, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and two counts of perjury, each of which 
carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
The statutory maximum penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational 
purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be determined by the judge. 
Ms. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and the NYPD.

UNITED STATES ATTORNEY'S OFFICE 
Southern District of New York 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL CHARGED IN MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURT FOR 
CONSPIRING WITH JEFFREY EPSTEIN TO SEXUALLY ABUSE MINORS 
Maxwell is Alleged to Have Facilita- ted, Participated in Acts of Abuse 
Additionally Charged With Perjury in Connection With 2016 Depositions 
Audrey Strauss, the Acting United States Attorney- for the Southern District of New York, William F. 
Sweeney Jr., the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation ("FBI"), and Dermot Shea, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department ("NYPD"), 
announced that GHISLANE MAXWELL was arrested this morning and charged with enticing a minor to travel 
to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, 
conspiracy to commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. The Indictment 
unsealed today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 through 1997, MAXWELL and co-conspirator 
Jeffrey Epstein exploited girls as young as 14, including by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the 
purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference for young girls, 
MAXWELL played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations 
including New York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, MAXWELL made several false 
statements in sworn depositions in 2016. MAXWELL is expected to be presented this afternoon in the in federal 
court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan. 
Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated, aided, and 
participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then 
delivered them into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust. 
EFTA00017719
--- PAGE 2 ---
All the while, she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself. 
Today, after many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the 
most important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the 
law and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth into 
behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the quest for 
justice has been met with great disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. The 
example set by the women involved has been a powerful one. They persevered against the rich and connected, 
and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a subpoena - and they stood together. I have no doubt the bravery 
exhibited by the women involved here has empowered others to speak up about the crimes of which they've been 
subjected." 
NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said: "The heinous crimes these charges allege are, and always will 
be abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement 
partners, for their continuing commitment to bringing justice to the survivors of sexual assault, everywhere." 
If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, please contact 
the FBI at 1-800-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
According to the Indictment[l I unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated 
in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, 
which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies or 
taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at 
ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. 
Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to accept offers of 
financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. MAXWELL also 
normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, encouraging them to massage 
Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and 
susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between 
minor victims and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL 
was present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages 
during which a minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein 
involving a minor victim where MAXWELL was present. 
As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching 
of a victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to 
touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and 
Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as 
well as MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment.

delivered them into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust. 
All the while, she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself. 
Today, after many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the 
most important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the 
law and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth into 
behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the quest for 
justice has been met with great disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. The 
example set by the women involved has been a powerful one. They persevered against the rich and connected, 
and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a subpoena - and they stood together. I have no doubt the bravery 
exhibited by the women involved here has empowered others to speak up about the crimes of which they've been 
subjected." 
NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said: "The heinous crimes these charges allege are, and always will 
be abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement 
partners, for their continuing commitment to bringing justice to the survivors of sexual assault, everywhere." 
If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, please contact 
the FBI at 1-800-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
According to the Indictment[1] unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated 
in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, 
which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies or 
taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at 
ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. 
Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to accept offers of 
financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. MAXWELL also 
normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, encouraging them to massage 
Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and 
susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between 
minor victims and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL 
was present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages 
during which a minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein 
involving a minor victim where MAXWELL was present. 
As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching 
of a victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to 
touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and 
Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as 
well as MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
EFTA00017730
--- PAGE 3 ---
Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal 
sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to 
travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of 
transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, which carries a maximum sentence of 
years in prison, one count of conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual 
activity, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and two counts of perjury, each of which 
carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
The statutory maximum penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational 
purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be determined by the judge. 
Ms. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and the NYPD. 
This case is being handled by the Office's Public Corruption Unit. Assistant U.S. Attorneys 
and 
are in charge of the prosecution. 
The charges contained in the Indictment are merely accusations. The defendant is presumed innocent 
unless and until proven guilty.

spoke a bit about the case on our call on Tuesday and the truly remarkable job the team has done in bringing it. I won't 
repeat all of that, buy you should know, as you read press coverage today that already is making it seem like these charges 
were inevitable, that they were anything but, and that they are instead the result of an extraordinary amount of work and 
perseverance and creativity by 
in building a case based on conduct that I'm pretty sure is older 
than all of our paralegals. 
will be holding a press conference at 12, and while it is sadly not possible for all of us to be there to join her given 
current conditions, I hope we can all take a moment to remotely congratulate the team on a terrific accomplishment in 
bringing an extremely important case against a woman very worthy of criminal prosecution.

Gary, 
Our understanding is that U.S. Attorney Berman made a factual statement in response to a specific question that 
suggested the Duke of York either would or was cooperating, and he responded that to date he has not in fact provided 
cooperation with our investigation. That is, he corrected the record generally in a factually accurate statement; I don't 
believe this would create a misleading impression. I appreciate that you have advised us that your client has a desire to 
cooperate, and we look forward to hearing from you when he has made a determination as to whether he is in fact willing

Mr. Bloxsome, 
Thank you for your response and for confirming your representation. To respond to your question generally, in 
connection with our investigation of conduct relating to Jeffrey Epstein and certain of his associates, we wish to 
request a consensual, voluntary law enforcement interview with your client. Generally, we would expect to 
inquire about his relationship and communications with Jeffrey Epstein and his associates, as well as certain 
allegations that have arisen publicly and in our investigation to date. 
Although we recognize we separately have the ability to convey such a request through diplomatic and law 
enforcement channels, we understand we may also alternatively inquire directly with counsel, when an individual 
has legal representation. Given your representation, we are inquiring directly with counsel in the first instance. 
Certainly we can discuss our request in more detail, but we hope this will provide the information you were

We viewed this as an ad, asking that the vendor to be considered to sell services to us and not requiring any response by

FBI Florida wants us to obtain the consent of SDLF for FBI to turn over to us all the grand jury materials they have from the 
original Epstein case (we already obtained some files without them raising this issue, but now they have). Sharing grand 
jury material between different federal grand juries is specifically approved in Rule 6(e), and we have done this before 
with a letter acknowledgement, so this shouldn't be an issue. 
The question is whether we should have 
contact their crim chief on this issue (since the last contact was Lisa to the 
crim chief), or have ODAG coordinate. Let us know what you think?

What case am I using to bring witnesses into SONY. I can only bring people in for al, pretrial, trial and sometimes pre al. 
For the last three witnesses it was pre-trial. But that was when we had an open indictment. 
If you are interviewing more people in an investigation you are going to have to travel to them. 
I am not giving anyone a hard time I just need to follow the rules.

What we can do is have the Help Desk manually remove the standard VNS closing paragraphs from the letter for 
each of the registrants. We cannot remove the closing from the email notices (about five registrants have email

Following up on the below, given the development of the virus pandemic over the past week, any foreign travel for us is 
completely shut down. We certainly will plan to come to the U.K. whenever we are permitted, but in the interim this 
makes it even more valuable to get even a summary of what your client would expect to convey to us. Would it be 
possible to set up a call for later this week or sometime next week? And profound apologies for the inconvenience in 
changing plans, we certainly don't want to cause additional stress or anxiety to your client, the circumstances are just 
completely beyond our control.

Just to clarify, would it be possible for you to provide us even a very general or high-level summary of what she has told 
you? We ordinarily don't go into interviews completely blind when witnesses have counsel — and the Weinstein 
investigation had a great number of problems that we have been able to avoid. And separately, we'll of course keep you 
updated on our approval process as well.

I am afraid that an attorney proffer will not be possible. I have been working with the DA in New York on the Weinstein 
case and have simply offered up my clients to questions which has worked well. 
I am of course happy to speak over the phone but it seems to me that you are better off getting the information first hand. 
If you wish it may be sensible for you to initially have a call with my client? 
My client has made a complaint to the Met police regarding a sexual assault by Jeffrey Epstein whilst in London and in 
the employment of G Maxwell. Apart from the complaint itself, no further information has been provided to the police. 
I appreciate the issue re coronavirus of course. 
Kind regards, 
Jill

That's great, thank you for letting us know, and we'll check on that right away and get back to you as soon as possible. 
The only wrinkle, which unfortunately is completely beyond our control, is that there is now some talk of government 
international travel being prevented due to the coronavirus situation, but we'll talk to the relevant people here 
immediately. 
One thing that would be extremely helpful for us in the near-term, including in terms of getting approvals here — and we 
talked about this on the phone as well — would be to get an attorney proffer about your understanding of generally what 
information you expect your client will convey on the subjects we've spoken about? We completely understand that it's 
best to have her tell her story directly to us, but in terms of our preparation it's often very useful for both us and the 
witness for us to have had a conversation with counsel in the first instance. Would it be possible to set up a call to have 
that discussion? We could do as soon as tomorrow or Friday, or also next week. 
Thanks very much,

No problem at all, we understand this takes time, and we appreciate you getting back to us, and we're very grateful 
that your client is open to speaking with us. 
On your questions, we are certainly fine with the first two questions / requests — we're happy to meet with you and 
your client in an initial conversation, during which we can do the kind of introductions and explanations we've done 
with you (and that we do with all victim witnesses we meet), including answering any questions to the best of our 
ability, and then to take a break and have a more substantive discussion later on. 
Regarding the friend, does that individual also represent her as counsel? We aren't normally able to include 
individuals in addition to the witness and counsel in an interview—what does sometimes work is for someone who is 
providing support (a parent, friend, etc.) to be close by for any discussions, assistance, etc. anytime that a witness 
wants to speak with that person, which would of course be totally fine in this instance. Or if he represents her in his 
capacity as an attorney then he of course could be in the interview in that role (with the only caveat that we would just 
want to confirm that he himself is not separately a witness of some sort in the case). We unfortunately are not able to 
pay for third parties (including counsel) to travel in connection with witness interviews, though — if it's preferable, we 
certainly could pay for your client's travel to the U.S. for the interview, including airfare and lodging, if that makes it 
easier for the friend to be present? And we're happy to discuss any of this further by email or phone if that's useful —
I'll be at my desk for the next several hours and most of tomorrow, at 
or we could also set a time to 
chat, whatever would be helpful. 
thank you,

Hello 
Apologies for the slight delay. My client is willing to help but asks the following: 
• 
That there be a morning meeting at which introductions with a discussion as to the investigation and my clients 
involvement. I appreciate that you have explained this to me but I think further verbal clarification would assist. 
• 
In the afternoon and after a break, my client would be willing to answer questions, in so far as she can. 
• 
That a friend of hers be allowed to be present as well. However that friend is based in the US and would need 
to be flown over to London. He is a US lawyer. 
Perhaps you could let me know if this is possible? 
Kind regards, 
Jill

Jill, 
Following up on our phone call, thank you for talking with us again, and we wanted to get back to you regarding 
some of the additional follow-up questions you asked, and to describe in more detail for your client how we would 
expect to approach any discussion with your client if she were comfortable meeting with us. 
The absolute most important thing is that any discussion would be entirely voluntary, and by that we mean the 
decision to meet with us but also as to any topic or question—your client would be absolutely free to determine 
what topics she felt comfortable discussing. There is absolutely no pressure on victim witnesses to address anything 
that would make them uncomfortable at any time, and even if your client was willing to meet with us, we would tell 
EFTA00017775
--- PAGE 8 ---
her, as we do for any witness, that if any topic comes up that she wants to skip, or discuss with you privately, that is 
no problem at all. 
In fact, if you and she would prefer, we would be happy to have a meeting where we simply introduced ourselves, 
explained the status of our investigation, talked about how a discussion would proceed if your client ended up being 
comfortable with that, and answered in person any questions she. We have done that previously, where we do the 
talking rather than asking questions in an initial meeting, and that would of course be without any requirement for 
anything additional if she preferred not to. As I mentioned on the phone, we have consistently found that we are 
able to reassure individuals when we have the opportunity to meet in person so they can see directly our interest in 
approaching these discussions with great sensitivity and care. As I also mentioned on the phone, even if your client 
were willing to speak with us, there would be absolutely no need or requirement for her to talk about any assault or 
victimization she experienced. We wrote in our first email that we would primarily be interested in talking about 
topics such as the general scope of her employment, directions she received from Epstein or Maxwell, etc., and as 
always we would be guided by her comfort level. 
In terms of who would attend a meeting, we almost always work in pairs, so two prosecutors and two officers, and 
that's not to have extra people, but rather because it helps us to be as efficient as we can, and so witnesses can meet 
the people on the team. Our team is also majority female, and we always tell witnesses that if topics come up in a 
discussion that they would prefer to speak about just with women, that's fine and we can be flexible in the moment 
and are always guided by the comfort level of the victim. But I also want to stress that in terms of your client in 
particular, we don't expect to initially address issues of a very personal or sexual nature, and we certainly would tell 
you in advance if there came a time when we thought that might be important to address, and how we could 
facilitate that. Who exactly from our team would be at any meeting would depend on schedules, but we can assure 
you that every one of us has now spoken with dozens of victims in this case, and every one of us has extensive 
experience more generally working with victims and working on cases involving sex offenses. We are proud of how 
we have been able to work with victims in this case especially, given all of the circumstances, and we absolutely 
would take the same sensitive approach with your client as we have with the many other victims in this case who 
have spoken with us. 
Again, if it would be helpful even for us to just come to the U.K. and introduce ourselves and explain in person how 
our process works, and answer any questions your client has in person, we would absolutely be happy to do that 
with no obligation at all from her. We also could do that with the possibility that if she felt comfortable, we could 
just address the general subject of her employment, for example. But no obligation and no pressure. We continue 
to appreciate your and her willingness to even broach the possibility of a discussion, and we hope this is helpful. 
thank you very much,

Thanks for circling back, and we'll do our best to answer these questions. In terms of who would be in the room, the 
most likely answer is that it would be two of the prosecutors and the two law enforcement officers on the case. The 
only reason I saw "most likely" rather than having a definitive answer is that when we're interviewing in a foreign 
country, it sometimes is the case the local law enforcement also insists on having representatives present. I don't 
believe that's required in the U.K., but we can check on it and give you a definitive answer in the coming days if that's 
useful. (Also, if she preferred to be interviewed in the U.S., we certainly could guarantee that the room would be just 
the case team, and we could arrange for travel and lodging for her. Let us know if that's the case, but otherwise 
we're of course happy to travel to her.) 
Regarding access to notes, it would principally be the investigative team—so again, the prosecutors and the FBI team 
working on the case. Our respective supervisors also theoretically have access to our files, but the reports are not 
generally widely disseminated. The basic logistics are that an agent takes notes during an interview, and then types 
up those notes into a formal report (called an FBI Form 302). We don't ordinarily share notes with other entities, but 
I can also check on that to see if I can make a more specific representation with respect to your client. 
With respect to anonymity, I confess that I'm not familiar with the distinction you're referring to. In terms of our 
investigation, we don't publicly disclose the names of individuals we meet with, and we don't disclose to any other 
witnesses, for example, the identities of victims or witnesses we are meeting with. (And our policies on that don't 
change even for individuals who are in the position of your client, who have been widely publicly reported to have 
been connected to Epstein and/or his employees or associates). But if that doesn't answer your question, we're of 
course happy to discuss further. Let me know if it might be useful to have a call? Or if not, also happy to address any 
follow-up via email. 
thanks,

Ms. Greenfield, 
Thank you again for speaking with us earlier today regarding our interest in talking with your client in connection 
with our investigation into the conduct of Jeffrey Epstein. 
As requested, we wanted to briefly memorialize our current views and understandings of your client, and also to 
reiterate our interest in approaching any discussion with great care and sensitivity, particularly to avoid adding to 
her trauma or causing re-victimization. 
As we mentioned on the phone, your client is not a target of our investigation—it sounds like the analogue in the 
U.K. may be the "suspect" category—and we currently do not have reason to believe that she has committed any 
U.S. federal crime. As we discussed, our knowledge of your client specifically is somewhat limited, having never 
spoken to her—and therefore knowing about her only through other witnesses and records—but it certainly has 
been our experience that the overwhelming majority of young women and girls who were in the orbit of Jeffrey 
Epstein during the relevant periods were subject to his abuse. It does not surprise us, nor do we have any trouble 
believing, that your client was similarly a victim. I hope that is helpful in understanding the capacity in which we 
hope to speak with her. 
Separately, and as we also discussed, any discussion with our team would be entirely voluntary—and that extends 
not just to whether she would be willing to meet with us at all, but also including her ability to decline to discuss 
particular topics or even particular questions, and to talk with her counsel at any time, to take any breaks that 
would be beneficial while we're meeting, etc. 
In terms of topic areas, we would be hoping to learn about the general narrative of her interactions with Epstein 
and his other associates and employees, including Ghislaine Maxwell, whom we understand she may have worked 
directly for. That would broadly include how she came to be in contact with them, the nature and scope of her 
employment, any instructions she was given relating to other women or girls, and just generally her experiences 
and observations in interacting with them. We ordinarily would also be interested in understanding the general 
nature of the abuse she was subjected to, but I want to emphasize that we would not need to discuss with her the 
specifics if she weren't comfortable with that, and in particular we often don't even broach that subject in a first 
meeting. 
Please let us know if you have any additional questions, and in particular whether any other information from us 
would be useful, and we look forward to speaking with you again soon.

Re: 
Continued investigation into possible collaborators of Jeffrey Epstein 
Dear 
Thank you for speaking with myself and others from the New Mexico Office of the Attorney 
General last week. Pursuant to our telephone conversation, this Office is providing the enclosed 
materials related to the criminal investigation and potential prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein's 
co-conspirators. The enclosed documents include police reports, recorded witness interviews, 
correspondence amongst New Mexico State agencies, and documents related to Epstein's leasing 
of New Mexico public lands. 
As previously discussed, all conduct described in our investigation occurred prior to 2008, the 
year New Mexico enacted its human-trafficking statute. See NMSA 1978, Sections 30-52-1 to 
-2.1. Should you have any questions, require any law-enforcement assistance in New Mexico, or 
become aware of any criminal charges implicating New Mexico law not barred by New 
Mexico's statute of limitations, NMSA 1978, Section 30-1-8, I ask that you do not hesitate to 
contact me directly. 
Should further investigation reveal additional survivors of crimes occurring in New Mexico, 
know that this Office intends to work in union with the United States Attorney for the District of 
New Mexico to ensure that these brave survivors have the opportunity to see that justice is 
achieved in a court of law. Again, please contact me personally if your investigation reveals 
survivors of crimes occurring in New Mexico not mentioned in the provided investigative 
materials.

Will report that federal prosecutors and investigators are probing whether the two staffers guarding Jeffrey Epstein's unit 
the night of his death falsified records that logged how often they were checking on him. 
If the staffers are found to have falsified records, they could face criminal charges in the Southern District of New York.

I hope you are well and getting some time "off" this summer. I'm reaching out via email as it may be the most efficient

Deutsche Bank has received a third-party subpoena from the Attorney General's Office of the U.S. Virgin Islands in 
connection with a pending civil suit they have filed against Jeffrey Epstein's estate, the executors of the estate, and 
others. One of the requests is for a copy of any government subpoenas received by the Bank relating to Epstein, and a 
copy of any productions made pursuant to the subpoenas. Do we have your permission to disclose your subpoena and 
our production to you to the U.S.V.I. AG? Would you prefer us to refer the office to you directly or provide you with 
contact information? I'm happy to send you a copy of the U.S.V.I. AG subpoena if helpful in evaluating the request.

Re: 
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
The Government respectfully submits this letter in opposition to the defendant's letter of 
August 17, 2020 (the "Defense Letter"), requesting that the Court enter an order permitting the 
defendant to file under seal in certain civil cases (the "Civil Cases") discovery materials produced 
by the Government in the instant criminal case, and to refer to, but not file, additional other 
discovery materials produced by the Government in the Civil Cases. Those applications should 
be denied.' 
As an initial matter, the Government has already produced, and will continue to produce, 
substantial volumes of materials in discovery consistent with its obligations. Those include 
materials the Government obtained via search warrant, grand jury subpoenas, or other investigative 
methods available only to the Government. Indeed, the Government has already produced more 
than 165,000 pages of discovery to the defense, including the materials relevant to the Defense 
Letter. Through her most recent application, the defendant seeks permission to use, in unrelated 
civil litigation, materials produced pursuant to the protective order in this case and designated 
"Confidential" thereunder. 
As detailed herein, the Government's designation is entirely 
appropriate given that the materials—court orders and applications—have been kept under seal by 
the issuing judges, and pertain to an ongoing criminal investigation. 
' The Government has drafted this letter in a manner that avoids revealing the contents of sealed 
materials and grand jury information. Accordingly, the Government does not seek permission to 
seal or redact this submission. Because the Defense Letter repeatedly references, and attaches as 
exhibits, materials that are sealed and that would jeopardize an ongoing grand jury investigation if 
filed publicly, the Government intends to submit a separate letter, under seal, proposing redactions 
to the Defense Letter and requesting that the attachments to the Defense Letter be filed under seal.

Page 2 
In particular, the Defense Letter seeks this Court's authorization to use materials relating 
to applications the Government made seeking the modification of certain protective orders in other 
judicial proceedings. By way of background, the Government sought such modifications to permit 
compliance with criminal grand jury subpoenas (the "Subpoenas"). Those Subpoenas were issued 
to a certain recipient (the "Recipient") after the Government opened a grand jury investigation into 
Jeffrey Epstein and his possible co-conspirators. For obvious reasons and in keeping with its 
standard practice, the Government did not notify the defendant or her counsel that it had issued 
the Subpoenas. In response to receiving the Subpoenas, the Recipient advised the Government 
that it believed that certain existing protective orders precluded full compliance. Accordingly, in 
or about February 2019, the Government applied ex parte and under seal to each relevant court to 
request modification of the respective protective orders to permit compliance with the Subpoenas. 
In or about April 2019, one court ("Court-1") granted the Government's application, and permitted 
that the Government share its order—and only that order, which itself prohibited further 
dissemination—to the Recipient. 2 Subsequently, the second court ("Court-2") denied the 
Government's application. Because the relevant grand jury investigation remains ongoing, both 
Court-1 and Court-2 have ordered that the filings regarding the Subpoenas remain under seal, 
except that both have expressly permitted the Government to produce those filings to the defendant 
as part of its discovery obligations in this criminal case. The Defense Letter now seeks to use 
those discovery materials in the Civil Cases. 
At base, the defendant's application fundamentally misapprehends the nature and process 
of criminal proceedings, and it further reflects an inappropriate effort to blur the lines between the 
criminal discovery process and civil litigation. To be clear: the purpose of criminal discovery is 
to enable the defendant to defend herself in the criminal action, not to provide her with a trove of 
materials she can mine to her advantage in civil discovery. Her motion is nothing more than an 
effort to evade the directives of the protective order entered by this Court just three weeks ago. It 
should be denied for multiple reasons. 
First, and as the defendant concedes, the protective order in this case expressly provides 
that any and all discovery material produced to the defendant by the Government, regardless of 
designation, "[s]hall be used by the Defendant or her Defense Counsel solely for purposes of the 
defense of this criminal action, and not for any civil proceeding or any purpose other than the 
defense of this action." Protective Order 11 1(a), 10(a), 14(a) (emphasis added) (Dkt. 36). Indeed, 
the defendant included that same provision, word-for-word, in her own proposed protective order. 
This was not a provision about which the defendant and the Government disagreed. See 
Defendant's Proposed Protective Order ¶ 1(a) (Dkt. 29-1). Yet less than a month later, the 
defendant is asking the Court to sanction her effort to utilize materials produced by the 
In the Defense Letter, the defendant argues that the Government "must have given a copy of the 
sealed order" to the Recipient, which defense counsel suggests is inconsistent with the 
Government's statement that it rarely provides discovery material to third parties. The defendant's 
suggestion is patently incorrect. The relevant order was signed in April 2019 and was issued for 
the purpose of being provided to the Recipient. Indeed the order contained an explicit provision 
that it could be transmitted to the Recipient. Accordingly, the order was conveyed to the Recipient 
well over a year before it became "discovery" in this criminal case.

Government in discovery in this criminal case, and to which the protective order unquestionably 
applies, to litigate her Civil Cases. There is no basis to modify the Protective Order here. 
Second, there is good reason why both parties proposed, and the Court ordered, a protective 
order that prevents the defendant from using materials obtained through the process of criminal 
discovery in any of the many civil cases in which she is, or could become, a party. To allow the 
defendant to do so would permit the dissemination of a vast swath of materials, including those 
that are confidential due to witness privacy interests, personal identifying information of third 
parties, and relevance in ongoing grand jury investigations. Here, the Government was particularly 
concerned about the defendant's interests in blurring these lines because, among other reasons, her 
counsel in the criminal case are also her counsel in the Civil Cases. It would be grossly 
inappropriate for defense counsel to be permitted to sift through the criminal case discovery and 
cherry-pick materials they may believe could provide some advantage in their efforts to defend 
against accusations of abuse by victim plaintiffs, delay court-ordered disclosure of previously-
sealed materials, or any other legal effort the defendant may be undertaking at any particular time. 
And yet that is what the defendant proposes. 
Third, the specific documents at issue pertain to a parte applications made as part of an 
ongoing grand jury investigation. Those documents were filed under seal and presently remain 
under seal because the relevant judicial officers have ordered that all filings regarding those 
matters, including the discovery materials referenced in the Defense Letter, remain sealed? As 
the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York has stated publicly, the 
investigation into the conduct of the defendant in this case and other possible co-conspirators of 
Jeffrey Epstein remains active. The full scope and details of that investigation, however, have not 
been made public.' Accordingly, the materials the defendant seeks to file in the Civil Cases were 
produced under a "Confidential" designation. 
Any argument that such materials are not 
"confidential" would not only run contrary to the sealing orders entered by other courts, but also 
misapprehends the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of criminal investigations.5 See, 
The only exceptions to those sealing orders are (1) as noted above, the permission from Court-1 
to provide the April 2019 order alone to the Recipient, and, (2) pursuant to separate permissions 
the Government has obtained in connection with its discovery obligations, that the entirety of the 
record relating to the Subpoenas may be provided to the defendant as discovery in this case. The 
defendant's claim that the relevant materials were produced to the defendant in discovery without 
any application to the sealing courts, Def. Ltr. at 7, is incorrect. 
To the extent it would be useful to this Court for the Government to further elaborate on the 
nature of the ongoing grand jury investigation, the Government is prepared to file a supplemental 
letter specifically on that subject ex parte and under seal should the Court request such an 
explanation. 
Moreover, if counsel for the defendant in her Civil Cases believe that certain documents are 
improperly sealed, there is no impediment to counsel making sealed applications to Court-1 and 
Court-2, respectively, to unseal the relevant materials. Presumably they have not done so because

e.g., United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 506, 531 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) ("As a general proposition, 
courts have repeatedly recognized that materials, including even judicial documents which are 
presumptively accessible, can be kept from the public if their dissemination might 'adversely affect 
law enforcement interests.") (citing United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1050)); see also 
United States v. Park, 619 F. Supp. 2d 89, 94 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (holding that the need to "maintain 
the secrecy of the Government's investigation" outweighed the public's right of access to certain 
sentencing documents). 
Fourth, defense counsel cites not a single case to support the argument that a criminal 
defendant should be permitted to use criminal discovery materials in her civil cases. Nor is the 
Government aware of any. Though precedent on this issue appears to be somewhat sparse—
perhaps because few defendants attempt such a maneuver—see United States v. Calderon, 15 Cr. 
025, 2017 WL 6453344, at *3 (D. Conn. Dec. I, 2017) (discussing the relative lack of specific 
guidance in the context of an application to modify protective orders in criminal cases), see also 
United States v. Morales, 807 F.3d 717, 721 (5th Cir. 2015) ("[m]otions to modify protective 
orders in criminal cases appear to be infrequent"), decisions that do exist have rejected the kind of 
blurring of the line between criminal and civil proceedings that the defendant attempts here. See 
Calderon, 2017 WL 6453344, at 5-6 (denying a defendant's application for modification of a 
criminal protective order so he could use certain discovery materials in a FOIA suit); United States 
v. DeNunzio, --- F. Supp. 3d ---, 2020 WL 1495880, at *2-.3 (D. Mass. March 27, 2020) (denying 
a defendant's motion to modify two protective orders in his criminal case for the purpose of 
pursuing claims in a civil action, even following the completion of trial). 
Absent any authority upon which to rely, the defendant, in urging a contrary conclusion, 
makes various assertions and accusations, none of which warrant a different outcome. In 
particular, there is no merit or particular relevance to the defendant's argument that the 
Government secretly obtained a volume of materials relevant to its criminal case without telling 
the defendant. That is how grand jury subpoenas and investigations frequently work. Defense 
counsel's overheated rhetoric notwithstanding, there is simply nothing nefarious about the 
Government obtaining materials through grand jury subpoena process, let alone anything about 
the manner in which the Government obtained these materials that warrants the relief requested. 
Certainly to the extent the defendant asserts that her adversary in civil litigation has 
engaged in some sort of improper conduct—assertions the Government by no means intends to 
suggest agreement with—such arguments even if credited would not be a proper basis to 
circumvent the plain language of the protective order (or the existing sealing orders) in this case. 
In any event, of the materials at issue, the only document the defendant's civil adversary has access 
to is the lone April 2019 order, meaning any purported imbalance between the parties in the Civil 
Cases at this stage is significantly overstated. And to the extent the defendant may seek to make 
similar accusations against the Government or challenge the manner in which the Government 
obtained the materials at issue—a challenge that itself would not justify the relief presently 
they recognize that the materials are appropriately sealed as relating to an ongoing grand jury 
investigation.

requested—the defendant can make such arguments, and the Government can and will vigorously 
oppose them, at the appropriate stage in this case. 
Finally, to the extent the defendant contends that the relief requested is somehow necessary 
to her ability to bring issues to the attention of other courts, the Defense Letter completely fails to 
explain what legal argument she wishes to make in her Civil Cases based on the discovery 
materials she has identified or what relevance those materials have to the litigation of the Civil 
Cases. The fact that the Government issued grand jury subpoenas and obtained court authorization 
for compliance with one of those subpoenas has no conceivable relevance to disputed issues in the 
Civil Cases. To the extent the defendant argues that the requested relief is necessary to ensure that 
courts adjudicating the Civil Cases are aware of the existence of the documents at issue, the 
defendant identifies no specific reason why these materials are relevant to the issues pending in 
those cases, other than to falsely accuse the Recipient and the Government of some sort of 
malfeasance.' 
In sum, the defendant's arguments in favor of her application offer no explanation of the 
relevant legal theory the materials would support, not to mention a compelling reason for this Court 
to permit an end-run around the protective order and permit the use of criminal discovery to litigate 
a civil case. Accordingly, the application in the Defense Letter should be denied.

If anything, the Defense Letter suggests that the defendant intends to use criminal discovery 
materials to attack the Government in the Civil Cases, attacks of no discernable relevance in those 
cases and made in a forum in which the Government is not a party and would have no opportunity 
to respond.

Chris, 
I have asked our paralegal and IT staff how large a drive we will need, and I hope to have an answer for you by our 1:30 
call today. 
As for the most recent production, the hard drive contains the production prepared by our vendor, which includes 
approximately 1.2 million documents. The CD contains the final portion of the responsive images from Epstein's iPhone. 
So they were produced separately because they were prepared by different offices: the hard drive was prepared by the 
vendor, and the CD was prepared by our paralegals. 
Because we are planning to put all productions onto a single hard drive, as you requested, the files from the CD will be 
included on that new drive, so Ms. Maxwell will have those files both on a CD and on a hard drive. 
Best,

Thanks, 
We will provide another drive to load the full production. We just have to figure out how big it needs to be. If you have 
any thoughts on that, please let me know. 
Also, can you explain the difference between the hard drive and the CD? Did you just need a little more space than what 
the hard drive offered? Or is there a reason you put certain files on the CD? I note that the laptop does not contain a disk

Chris, 
I have asked MDC staff to provide Ms. Maxwell with the drive containing the November 9th discovery production and will 
follow up with them again about it. 
We can certainly make a copy of all productions to date on a single hard drive for Ms. Maxwell to review at the MDC. My 
apologies, I did not appreciate that you were requesting a full reproduction of all past discovery. My understanding was 
that the reproductions contained on the November 9th drive would address your concerns. If you would prefer to have a 
single drive containing all productions, we can certainly accommodate that request. Please let me know if you would like 
us to use one of the drives already at the MDC for this purpose, or if you would like to provide my office with a new drive. 
My understanding from the MDC is that for security purposes, the laptop will be kept in a locker to which only two 
lieutenants have access. Those two lieutenants work Monday through Friday 8:30am to 3:30pm, which is when Ms. 
Maxwell will have access to the laptop. For the remainder of the 13 hours of review time, Ms. Maxwell may review her 
discovery on the MDC computer. The laptop is being provided to allow Ms. Maxwell to open files that she could not open 
on the MDC computer. 35 hours per week should be more than sufficient to review any excel files or other file types that 
cannot be viewed on the MDC computer.

--- PAGE 3 ---
We will send someone to pick up the new production. But as we discussed, if Ms. Maxwell has to rely on the existing hard 
drives to view the discovery on the new laptop, that is not going to work. 
For one thing, Ms. Maxwell still has not received the hard drive you produced on November 9, which was supposed to 
contain replacement copies of the files on the hard drive produced on September 3 (which was broken in MDC) and the 
files in the October 2 production (see attached email). We cannot rely on a drive that has not been made available to Ms. 
Maxwell. 
Also, when we spoke about the laptop, my understanding was that if you could not load the files directly onto the laptop, 
you would create a new hard drive that contained the entire discovery production and that you would verify that the files 
on that hard drive were readable on the new laptop. That way, we would not have to rely on a patchwork of prior hard 
drives which had a lot of problems. 
To be clear, I don't think the laptop solution you have proposed will solve the problems that Ms. Maxwell has been 
experiencing and is not consistent with what we discussed. If there is no way to load the full discovery on the laptop 
itself, then please advise if you are able to create a new hard drive that contains the complete production (without the 
highly confidential materials) that can be made available to Ms. Maxwell in the MDC. 
Also, I have been informed by Ms. Maxwell, that the MDC told her today that she will only be able to use the laptop to 
review discovery from 8:30am-3:30pm on weekdays. That is only seven hours a day, as opposed to the 13 hours a day 
(plus weekends) that the BOP had agreed to before. There is no reason for this restriction. It is also not acceptable. In 
this latest production alone, there are over 2 million pages to review. Ms. Maxwell cannot possibly review that much 
material by trial if her review is restricted in this way. Please confirm that she will be able to have the full 13 hours per 
day (plus weekends) to review the discovery, as previously agreed. 
Thanks, 
Chris

This morning, I hand delivered a copy of this production and a laptop to the MDC for Ms. Maxwell. My understanding

Our IT staff, paralegal staff, and I have all confirmed that this laptop is able to open every file type contained in the

Would you be available tomorrow (11/25) afternoon to discuss, please? Apologies for the late request, but we are hoping

Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell 
Cr. 330 (AJN) 
USDC SDNY 
DOCUMENT 
ELECTRONICALLY FILED 
DOCO: 
DATE FILED: 11/24/20 
As counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell, I write in response to the government's letter, dated 
November 23, 2020 (see Dkt 74), reporting Ms. Maxwell's conditions of detention and 
confirming that she is currently in quarantine due to contact with a staff member, assigned to her 
isolation pod, who tested positive for COVID-19. 
The government recites a variety of allowances given Ms. Maxwell, including being 
permitted out of her cell three times a week during quarantine for a maximum of 30 minutes, the 
total time allotted for showering, making personal calls, and using the CorrLinks email system to 
communicate with family and counsel. However, the letter presents an incomplete picture of 
Ms. Maxwell's conditions of confinement. 
The government fails to mention a variety of issues brought to the attention of the MDC, 
including but not limited to the fact: that all email correspondence between Ms. Maxwell and 
counsel was deleted in advance of the 180-day period, when deletion is expected to occur; that 
after being administered two nasal swab tests, under threat of 21-day quarantine if she declined 
to be tested, Ms. Maxwell was ordered to remove her COVID-protection mask for an in-mouth 
inspection, further risking exposure to the virus; that Ms. Maxwell was initially quarantined 
without soap or a toothbrush; that medical and psychology staff, who checked on Ms. Maxwell 
daily pre-quarantine, have ceased doing so daily since quarantine and have neither informed her 
of results of the COVID tests nor provided information in response to her inquiry regarding what 
she should do if she becomes symptomatic. 
The letter omits the fact that while staff are not supposed to enter Ms. Maxwell's 
isolation cell during quarantine, an unidentified man entered to take photographs and a guard 
entered to search. Further, while counsel assumed that an in-person legal visit scheduled for 
Saturday, November 21, would be canceled as a result of Ms. Maxwell's quarantine status, no 
notification was provided; and a request for a substituted legal call was not accommodated.

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 76 Filed 11/24/20 Page 2 of 2 
LAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIM 
The government highlights what Ms. Maxwell is permitted but not what she is denied: 
equal treatment accorded other inmates in general population. Ms. Maxwell has spent the 
entirely of her pretrial detention in de facto solitary confinement under the most restrictive 
conditions where she is excessively and invasively searched and is monitored 24 hours per day. 
In addition to camera surveillance in her cell, a supplemental camera follows her movement 
when she is permitted to leave her isolation cell and is focused on Ms. Maxwell and counsel 
during in-person legal visits. And despite non-stop in-cell camera surveillance, Ms. Maxwell's 
sleep is disrupted every 15-minutes when she is awakened by a flashlight to ascertain whether 
she is breathing. 
Ms. Maxwell is a non-violent, exemplary pretrial detainee with no criminal history, no 
history of violence, no history of mental health issues or suicidal ideation. She is overmanaged 
under conditions more restrictive than inmates housed in 10South, the most restrictive unit in the 
MCC; or individuals convicted of terrorism and capital murder and incarcerated at FCI Florence 
ADMAX, the most restrictive facility operated by the BOP. The MDC concedes that it is unable 
to place her in general population for her safety and the security of the institution but fails to 
explain why she is deprived of all other opportunities provided to general population inmates. 
Stating that Ms. Maxwell "continues to have more time to review her discovery than any 
other inmate at the MDC, even while in quarantine" gives the unfair impression that she is being 
given a perquisite. However, given the voluminous discovery in this case, the most recent 
production alone being 1.2 million documents, the time accorded Ms. Maxwell remains 
inadequate for her to review and prepare the defense of her life. 
Due to the failure of MDC's Warden and Legal Department to respond to recurring 
problems and complaints, counsel have reached out to the government. While we appreciate any 
assistance provided by government counsel, it has done little to redress the many concerns 
regarding the disparate treatment of Ms. Maxwell. 
Rather than receive second-hand information from counsel, the defense requests that the 
Court summon Warden Heriberto Tellez to report directly to the Court and counsel on Ms. 
Maxwell's conditions of detention. 
Your consideration is greatly appreciated. 
Very truly yours,

OF JUDGE NATHAN'S INDIVIDUAL PRACTICES IN CRIMINAL CASES)

New York, New York 10007 
Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
800 Third Avenue 
New Yolk, NY 10022 
+1 212 957 7600 phone 
whwtcohensresser cool 
On behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we plan to file a Renewed Motion for 
Release on Bail (the "Motion") and respectfully request an in camera conference, with all 
counsel present, to address the appropriate procedures for the filing and consideration of the 
Motion. For the reasons explained below, we intend to request, pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 
49.1(d), that the Court permit the filing of portions of the Motion and certain supporting 
materials under seal and require that any responsive materials be filed under seal. We believe an 
in camera conference would be the most efficient form to address these issues and other 
confidentiality concerns related to the Motion. We intend to provide a full set of materials to the 
government, Pretrial Services, and the Court when the Motion is filed. We are merely requesting 
that sensitive contents of the submission be accorded confidentiality protections similar to those 
that the government routinely requires in protective orders, including the one in this case. 
In the four months since this Court denied Ms. Maxwell's request for bail and granted the 
government's motion for detention, Ms. Maxwell and her counsel have assembled substantial 
information that was not available to present at the initial hearing, as well as a comprehensive 
bail package co-signed by sureties who were unable to come forward at that time. Accordingly, 
Ms. Maxwell now seeks to renew her request for bail pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3142(0. 
Ms. Maxwell's renewed application will rely on sensitive and private information that, if 
made public, would be highly damaging to both Ms. Maxwell and third parties, including: 
• Letters from Ms. Maxwell's family members and close friends, who have agreed to 
serve as sureties to support Ms. Maxwell's renewed bail application. The letters 
contain personal details that, if made public, would invite identification and

harassment of the sureties and other third parties, including minor children. They are 
legitimately afraid that if their identities become public, they will be subjected to the 
same relentless media scrutiny and threats that Ms. Maxwell has experienced for 
more than a year, like the following sample of social media posts: 
"they need to get this bitch n string her up by her neck . . Peking monster . . . 
#GhislaineMaxwell." 
"I hope someone finds her and kills her. That would be justice. Obviously her 
lawyers know's where she is, someone should stick them up to batteries untill we 
find out where she is." 
"SHE'S HERE in Massachusetts ?! The bitch #GhislaineMaxwell who 
ftSexTrafficked young girls for #Epstein ?!?! Why the hell isn't she being brought in 
for questioning @ManchesterMAPD ?! WE DO NOT WANT HER HERE! 
#SleezyLeach She is CLOSE ENOUGH to me, I could grab her myself!" 
• 
A financial report, prepared by the accounting firm Macalvins Limited, that provides 
a summary of Ms. Maxwell's financial condition from 2015-2020 and discloses all of 
her assets, all assets held in trust, and assets held by other family members. 
• 
A discussion and analysis of certain materials produced by the government in 
discovery marked "Confidential" and their impact on the government's case against 
Ms. Maxwell, which must be filed under seal pursuant to the terms of the Protective 
Order in this case (Dkt. 36). 
Fed. R. Crim. P. 49.1(d) provides that "a court may order that a filing be made under seal 
without redaction. The court may later unseal the filing or order the person who made the filing 
to file a redacted version for the public record." While the Second Circuit has recognized a 
presumption of access under both common law and the First Amendment, it is appropriate to 
permit the filing of documents under seal if "countervailing factors" in the common law 
framework or "higher values" in the First Amendment framework so demand. Lugosch v. 
Pyramid Co. of Onandaga, 435 F.3d 110, 124 (2d Cir. 2006); see also Unites States v. Wey, 256 
F. Supp. 3d 355, 411 (S.D.N.Y. 2017) (Nathan, J.) (granting motion to seal evidentiary exhibits 
and finding that privacy interests "outweigh any public interest in disclosure, whether derived 
from the First Amendment or the common-law right of access"). 
Moreover, a lower presumption of public access applies to documents submitted in 
connection with powers that are "ancillary to the court's core role in adjudicating a case" than to 
"material introduced at trial, or in connection with dispositive motions." Brown v. Maxwell, 929 
F.3d 41, 49-50 (2d Cir. 2019) (applying lower presumption to documents submitted in 
connection with discovery and evidentiary motions than to summary judgment filings). Thus, a 
lower presumption of public access attaches the parties' pretrial bail submissions than to exhibits 
introduced at trial or in connection with a motion to dismiss.

Here, that lower presumption is far outweighed by the significant privacy interests 
implicated by the materials at issue. See United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1050 (2d Cir. 
1995) ("[t]he privacy interests of innocent third parties ... should weigh heavily in a court's 
balancing equation"). If Ms. Maxwell's sureties are publicly identified, they will be harassed 
simply for their association with and support of her. Indeed, some of Ms. Maxwell's closest 
friends and famil have alread suffered 
ificant cons -i uences. For example, 
The sureties are legitimately scared that they and their children will suffer the same 
consequences, and may not be able to come forward at all, if the Court does not allow their 
letters and their identities to be sealed. See id. at 1051 ("[C]ourts have the power to insure that 
their records are not used to gratify private spite or promote public scandal[.]"). These 
individuals are entitled to the same privacy as Ms. Maxwell's accusers, no longer minors, who 
have been permitted to remain anonymous even though many have revealed their identities. 
The presumption of public access is also outweighed by Ms. Maxwell's privacy interest 
in details regarding her financial condition, as well as the privacy interests of third parties that 
would be implicated if Ms. Maxwell's assets were publicly disclosed. See id. (personal financial 
records traditionally considered private, not public). 
Similar privacy interests led the court to permit the redaction of bail submission materials 
in United States v. Nejad ("Sadr"), Case 1:18-cr-00224-AJN (S.D.N.Y.). Like this case, Sadr 
involved a defendant with meaningful assets and a bail package with numerous co-signers. At 
the initial bail hearing, Judge Carter ordered both defense counsel and the government to redact 
attachments to their submissions because they contained "sensitive private information with 
respect to a whole series of individuals." (Id., Dkt. 21 at 25.) The privacy interests at stake here 
are significantly higher, given the documented threats against Ms. Maxwell and harassment of 
her family and friends. 
For the reasons set forth above, we believe that portions of the Motion, and certain 
materials submitted in support thereof and in opposition thereto, should be filed under seal. We 
respectfully request an in camera conference to address these issues and other confidentiality 
concerns related to the Motion. We have consulted with the government, which consents to the 
redaction and sealed filing of (1) the names and identifying information of any proposed 
cosigners, (2) any discovery materials designated confidential under the Protective Order in this 
case, and (3) any information derived from confidential discovery materials in this case. The 
government does not consent to the in camera conference.

Re: 
United States v. Chislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
The Government respectfully submits this letter in opposition to the defendant's letter of 
August 10, 2020 (the "Defense Letter" or "Def. Ltr."), requesting that the Court order the 
Government to disclose the names of certain Government witnesses 1I months prior to trial, and 
requesting that the Court intervene in the protocols and individualized inmate determinations of 
the Bureau of Prisons. Both applications should be denied. 
A. The Defendant's Demand That the Government Name Certain Trial Witnesses 
For the third time in as many weeks, the defendant and her counsel have applied to the 
Court for relief that is premature, meritless, or both. See Order dated July 23, 2020 (Dkt. 28) 
(denying the defendant's request that the Court enter an order prohibiting the Government and 
attorneys for non-parties from making extrajudicial statements "concerning this case"); Order 
dated July 30, 2020 (Dkt. 37) (denying the defendant's application for a protective order that would 
allow the defense to publicly name and identify victims). In the defendant's most recent 
application, she asks the Court to order that the Government disclose a partial witness list, in the 
form of identifying certain victims referenced in the Superseding Indictment (the "Indictment"), 
fully 11 months prior to trial. This request is at best premature given that the production of 
discovery, on the schedule agreed to by the defendant, has just begun. Moreover, the parties have 
had no discussions about—let alone asked the Court to set—a schedule for pretrial disclosures, 
including for witness lists and 3500 material. 
In the first instance, the defendant complains about the status of discovery production, 
arguing that "almost six weeks since" the arrest of the defendant, the Government is "just now 
beginning to produce Rule 16 discovery, despite confirming to the Court that discovery would 
begin as soon as the Court entered a protective order." Def. Ltr. at 2. The suggestion that the 
Government somehow delayed that initial production is nonsense. As the Court is aware, the 
EFTA00017832
--- PAGE 2 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 41 Filed 08/13/20 Page 2 of 5 
Honorable Alison J. Nathan 
August 13, 2020 
Page 2 
protective order was docketed on Friday, July 31, 2020'—the timing of which was principally the 
result of the defendant's own refusal to agree to the terms of the proposed protective order. The 
Government then promptly produced an initial discovery production totaling more than 12,000 
pages the following Wednesday, August 5, 2020. Additionally, the Government continues to 
produce discovery and earlier today made a second production, as the Government advised defense 
counsel last week it intended to do, totaling more than 150,000 pages, principally consisting of 
financial records.2 Although the Government expects to continue to produce a large amount of 
electronic discovery, the two productions already made constitute the vast majority of initial 
discovery, including search warrant applications and subpoena returns, which the Government has 
now produced more than a week in advance of its deadline of August 21, 2020, and 
approximately 11 months prior to trial. 
In sum, the Government has acted expeditiously in meeting its initial discovery obligations, 
providing more than 165,000 pages of discovery materials in less than two weeks following the 
entry of the protective order—all of which was accompanied by detailed indices describing the 
general topics and sources of the materials. 
Against this backdrop, the Defense Letter claims that over the course of just five days, 
defense counsel determined, having "expeditiously reviewed [the discovery] for high level 
content," Def. Ltr. at 2, that they cannot possibly investigate the charges against their client based 
on the materials provided thus far, and asking the Court to order the Government to provide the 
defendant with a partial witness list. That request should be denied. 
Tellingly, the defendant cites no authority that requires the relief requested at this stage in 
the litigation—i.e., prior to the completion of discovery and approximately 11 months before 
trial—nor is the Government aware of any. For example, in the lead case cited by defense counsel, 
United States v. Cannone, 528 F.2d 296, 301 (2d Cir. 1975), although the opinion acknowledged 
the ability of district courts to compel disclosure of the identity of government witnesses, the 
Second Circuit reversed for abuse of discretion the district court's decision to do so in that case 
because the defendant there, as here, had made "only an abstract, conclusory claim that such 
disclosure was necessary to its proper preparation for trial." Id. at 301-02. In United States v. 
Rueb, 00 Cr. 091 (RWS), 2001 WL 96177, at '8 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 5, 2001), while the Court ordered 
the Government to provide the defendant with its witness list, it did so one month before trial, 
following the completion of discovery production and in the context of pretrial motions. Those 
circumstances plainly are not present here. Finally, in United States v. Warme, a Western District 
of New York opinion from 2009 that has never been cited by another court, although the Court 
' The Defense Letter states that the protective order was "entered" by the Court on July 30, 2020. 
While that is the date the protective order was signed by the Court, it was posted to the docket on 
July 31, 2020. 
The Government's most recent discovery transmittal letter also included the months and years of 
birth of the three victims identified in the Indictment, to enable the defendant to evaluate whether 
she will make any motions or legal arguments—more than four months in advance of the deadline 
for any such motion—relating to the ages of the victims.

Page 3 
ordered disclosure of a certain victim identity shortly after the indictment, the Court noted that the 
Government had already confirmed to the defendant the identities of three of the four relevant 
victims, and that a fourth victim, whose identity was at issue, was the subject of a charge that failed 
to identify the date of her alleged rape or any prior encounters between the victim and the 
defendant. 2009 WL 427111, at *2. None of those facts are present here—by contrast, here, the 
Indictment particularly describes relevant time periods and events, including referring to the 
defendant's conversations with victims, interactions with victims, and specific relevant locations.' 
To the extent the defendant is arguing that she cannot identify the nature of the charges 
against her, the proper vehicle for such an argument is a motion for a bill of particulars. Any such 
motion can be made in December with all other motions and following the completion of 
discovery. While the Government anticipates opposing such a motion as baseless on the facts of 
this case, the Government respectfully submits that in any event such a motion could not be 
meaningfully evaluated at this stage, prior to the completion of discovery. See United States v. 
Mahabub, 13 Cr. 908 (AJN), 2014 WL 4243657, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 26, 2014) (denying a 
motion for a bill of particulars that sought, among other things, the "alleged victim and noting that 
"[a] bill of particulars is not required unless the charges of the indictment are so general that they 
do not advise the defendant of the specific acts of which he is accused. The government can also 
discharge its obligation to disclose this information by other means, such as by presenting evidence 
in discovery. . . . A bill of particulars is not meant to provide the details of the government's 
evidence, or to be used as an investigative tool.") (emphasis added, quotations and citations 
omitted); see also United States v. Thompson, 13 Cr. 378 (AJN), 2013 WL 6246489, at *7 
(S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3, 2013) (denying a motion for a bill of particulars and noting that such motions 
are not "a general investigative tool, a discovery device or a means to compel the government to 
disclose evidence or witnesses to be offered prior to trial") (emphasis added) (quotations and 
citation omitted); cf. United States v. Sindone, 01 Cr. 517 (MBM), 2002 WL 48604, at *2 
(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 14, 2002) (denying a motion for a bill of particulars to identify "the unnamed 
alleged victim(s)" but instructing the government to disclose the name of any victim it did not 
intend to call as a witness at trial by 14 days prior to the start of trial). 
Alternatively, to the extent defense counsel is unable to assess or comprehend the discovery 
produced by the Government, the Government is more than willing to discuss with the defense 
Defense counsel's invocation of the protective order in support of its argument, Def. Ltr. at I, 3, 
should be of little comfort. The Government is deeply concerned by the recent actions of the 
defendant's counsel who represent her in both this criminal matter as well as in certain civil 
matters, and who in a recent public filing in a civil case referred to their receipt of sealed materials 
in discovery in this case. In particular, the defendant's counsel publicly claimed in a civil filing 
that they purportedly had received "critical new information" from the criminal case that it could 
not disclose "because it is subject to a protective order in the Criminal Action," and further noting 
publicly a desire to seek modification of the protective order in this case to use such materials in 
the civil case, which the protective order expressly precludes. See Giuffre v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 
No. 15 Civ. 7433 (LAP) (Dkt. 1100). Moreover, even assuming the defendant intends to 
scrupulously adhere to the terms of the protective order, that would not change the relevant legal 
standards, which weigh heavily against granting the requested relief.

any such issues as the discovery process continues. To date, the defendant has yet to ask the 
Government a single substantive question about the discovery. The Government is also prepared 
to engage in good faith discussions with the defense about an appropriate schedule for disclosure 
of 3500 material, exhibit lists, and witness lists, all of which the Government expects to produce 
reasonably in advance of the trial date in July 2021 to permit the defense to investigate witnesses. 
But particularly given the nature of the charges, the Government's strong desire to protect the 
privacy of the alleged victims, and the lack of any legal precedent for the defendant's request, the 
Government respectfully submits that at the present time—eleven months prior to trial, nearly 
three months prior to the discovery deadline, and more than four months prior to the pretrial 
motions deadline—there is no basis for the defendant to demand the Government disclose the 
identity of its witnesses. 
B. The Defendant's Request that the Court Dictate the Conditions of Her Confinement 
The defendant's requests with respect to the conditions of her confinement at the 
Metropolitan Detention Center ("MDC") are similarly premature and unavailing, and her request 
that the Court dictate the terms of her confinement to the Bureau of Prisons ("BOP") should also 
be denied.' 
As an initial matter, the defendant's argument that she is being treated "worse" than other 
inmates is incorrect. There is no merit to her complaints about being monitored by staff, as it is 
entirely appropriate for BOP to carefully monitor any inmate, particularly a new inmate who has 
never before been incarcerated and who faces the strong likelihood of serving many years in prison. 
Additionally, like all inmates, the defendant may be subject to observation or searches of her 
person or space as appropriate.5 It is otherwise entirely unclear what specific "privileges given to 
other pretrial detainees" the defendant believes she is being denied. 
More generally, the defendant, like all pretrial inmates, is subject to an individualized 
assessment by the BOP with respect to his or her placement in a facility. Here, for reasons 
including safety, security, and the orderly functioning of the facility, BOP has made the 
determination that, at present, the defendant should not be fully integrated into the dorm-style 
accommodations of the general population. The Government understands from BOP that it will 
Once again, defense counsel has rushed to seek Court intervention on issues they have made little 
or no meaningful effort to address with the Government or, in this case, the BOP. The Government 
learned of the defendant's specific objections to her conditions of incarceration for the first time 
from the Defense Letter, and has since conferred with BOP to understand and to address the issues 
as appropriate. Moreover, as noted below, the defendant filed the instant challenge to the GOP's 
plan to permit her time to review discovery before the BOP had a chance to implement (and 
ultimately modify) that plan. 
Defense counsel claims that prison staff "constantly observe" the defendant "including her phone 
conversations with defense counsel." This is misleading. As with all inmates, the defendant is 
able to speak to her counsel behind a closed door, in an area that is visible—but not audible—to 
MDC staff. Among other reasons, this is so MDC staff can ensure that inmates do not complete 
calls with their counsel and then call other individuals on a non-recorded line.

Honorable Alison J. Nathan

continue to evaluate where the defendant should be housed within the facility and that the 
defendant will be placed into the general population if and when BOP is assured that such 
placement would not pose a threat to the orderly operation of the institution. The defendant 
identifies no basis for the Court to disturb that determination by the BOP, particularly given that, 
as detailed below, her housing assignment will not negatively affect her ability to review discovery 
in this case. 
Regarding the defendant's request in connection with access to discovery, the Government 
understands from BOP that the defendant had not even yet received her copy of the Government's 
first discovery production at the time the Defense Letter was filed—she received the materials on 
Tuesday, August II. While it is correct that GOP's initial plan was to provide three hours per day 
of access to the discovery—the same access that is granted to every other pretrial inmate, including 
those with trial dates scheduled for far earlier than July 2021-as of earlier this week, and given 
the volume of expected discovery, BOP informed the defendant that she will have the opportunity 
to access to her discovery from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. every day of the week. Although this 
arrangement will be subject to continued evaluation on an ongoing and individualized basis, and 
is subject to ordinary considerations of prison operations, BOP intends to provide that access on 
an ongoing basis to the extent it remains reasonably practicable to do so. Accordingly, this 
application should be denied as moot. 
C. Conclusion 
For the reasons set forth above, the defendants' requests, as set forth in the Defense Letter, 
should be denied.

PROFFER AGREEMENT 
With respect to the meeting o 
"Clien 
and her attorney, Jennifer Seidel, 
Esq., with Assistant United States Attorney 
to be held with the Office of the 
United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York on April 27, 2021 ("the meeting"), 
the following understandings exist: 
(1) THIS IS NOT A COOPERATION AGREEMENT. The Client has agreed to 
provide the Government with information, and to respond to questions, so that the Government 
may evaluate Client's information and responses in making prosecutive decisions. By receiving 
Client's proffer, the Government does not agree to make a motion on the Client's behalf or to enter 
into a cooperation agreement, plea agreement, immunity or non-prosecution agreement. The 
Government makes no representation about the likelihood that any such agreement will be reached 
in connection with this proffer. 
(2) In any prosecution brought against Client by this Office, except as provided below the 
Government will not offer in evidence on its case-in-chief, or in connection with any sentencing 
proceeding for the purpose of determining an appropriate sentence, any statements made by Client 
at the meeting, except (a) in a prosecution for false statements, obstruction of justice or perjury 
with respect to any acts committed or statements made during or after the meeting or testimony 
given after the meeting; or (b) if, at any time following the meeting, Client becomes a fugitive 
from justice. 
(3) Notwithstanding item (2) above: (a) the Government may use information derived 
directly or indirectly from the meeting for the purpose of obtaining leads to other evidence, which 
evidence may be used in any prosecution of Client by the Government; (b) in any prosecution 
brought against Client, the Government may use statements made by Client at the meeting and all 
evidence obtained directly or indirectly therefrom for the purpose of cross-examination should 
Client testify; and (c) the Government may also use statements made by Client at the meeting to 
rebut any evidence or arguments offered by or on behalf of Client (including arguments made or 
issues raised su
m;Dente by the District Court) at any stage of the criminal prosecution (including 
bail, all phases of trial, and sentencing) in any prosecution brought against Client 
(4) The Client understands and agrees that in the event the Client seeks to qualify for a 
reduction in sentence under Title 18, United States Code, Section 3553(f), United States 
Sentencing Guidelines, Sections 2D1.1(b)(18) or 5C1.2, or Fed. IL Crim. P. 35(b), the Office may 
offer or use at any stage of the criminal proceeding any statement made by Client during the 
meeting, and all evidence obtained directly or indirectly therefrom, to the extent such use is 
consistent with Section 402 of the First Step Act of 2018. 
(5) To the extent that the Government is entitled under this Agreement to offer in evidence 
any statements made by Client or leads obtained therefrom, Client shall assert no claim under the 
United States Constitution, any statute, Rule 410 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, or any other 
federal rule that such statements or any leads therefrom should be suppressed. It is the intent of 
this Agreement to waive all rights in the foregoing respects. 
EFTA00017844
--- PAGE 2 ---
(6) If this Office receives a request from another prosecutor's office for arms to 
information obtained pursuant to this Proffer Agreement, this Office may furnish such information 
but will do so only on the condition that the requesting office honor the provisions of this 
Agreement 
(7) It is further understood that this Agreement is limited to the statements made by Client 
at the meeting and does not apply to any oral, written or recorded statements made by Client at 
any other time. No imderstandings, promises, agreements and/or conditions have been entered 
into with respect to the meeting other than those set forth in this Agreement and none will be 
entered into unless in writing and signed by all parties. 
(8) The understandings set forth in paragraphs 1 through 7 above extend to the continuation 
of this meeting on the dates that appear below. 
(9) Client and Attorney acknowledge that they have fully discussed and understand every 
paragraph and clause in this Agreement and the consequences thereof.

Good afternoon-
In compliance with the Court's order, dated August 25th (attached), I hereby notify you 
of recent third-party interference with the "secure" Webex line used for confidentiaUprivileged communication 
between Ms. Maxwell and counsel. 
At the conclusion of yesterday afternoon's VTC session, Ms. Maxwell observed 
suspicious activity on the VTC monitor. 
She alerted MDC staff, and Case ManagerMvitnessed the activity. 
This is contrary to the Court's finding that "according to the Government and MDC Legal [Ms. Maxwell]'s 
difficulties communicating with counsel have been resolved" and contrary to "MDC's Legal assurances that [Ms. 
Maxwell]'s legal communication has not been interfered with..." 
Previously, the MDC has disputed such claims concerning interference with 
VTC communication between Ms. Maxwell and counsel. 
Now, an MDC insider bears witness to complaint by Ms. Maxwell and counsel. 
Please provide explanation for this interference and evidence of remediation 
before I report this latest problem to the Court. 
Thank you-
Bobbi

Defendant.

ELECTRONICALLY PILED 
DOC 0: 
DATE I:11.ED: 8/25/21 
20-CR-330 (AJN) 
ORDER 
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
Defendant submitted a letter on August 18 informing the Court about disruptions of 
attorney-client video teleconferences. Dkt. No. 319. After conferring with MDC Legal, the 
Government responded on August 23. Dkt. No. 326. According to the Government and MDC 
Legal, the Defendant's difficulties in communicating with her counsel via video teleconference 
have been resolved, and the Government's letter sufficiently addresses her other requests. The 
Court finds MDC Legal's assurance that Defendant's communications have not been interfered 
with, recorded, or listened to sufficient. No further application for relief was made in 
Defendant's August 24 reply. Dkt. No. 327. The Court remains confident that Ms. Maxwell is 
fully able to communicate with her defense counsel and to prepare for trial. If Defendant 
experiences further issues in communicating with her counsel, she should promptly notify the 
Court after conferring in good faith with the Government and MDC Legal. 
SO ORDERED.

Subject: RE: Aircraft info 
Please call when you get this information. 
(NY) (FBI) <
E> 
I have attached Registration information for N331JE and N722JE. N722JE is the entire aircraft registration file. N331JE is 
just the section that appeared to contain all relevant information to your case. I can give you the entire file if you think 
there is more that might be applicable, and certified copies of the entire files can be obtained if they need to be used in 
court. In my experience, sending the entire aircraft registration file from the start usually is daunting for the investigators, 
and leads to tons of questions just trying to figure out what might be relevant. Sometimes aircraft files are 300 pages or 
more, and that can be frustrating when maybe only 20 were relevant to the SUBJECT. 
I have also attached the LLC Documents for Hyperion Air LLC which is the registered owner for both N331JE and N722JE. 
I have attached the Airman File for the SUBJECT, which is encrypted due to PII. I will send the password in a follow-on e-
mail. I looked at the medical file, but I believe the information contained therein has limited value to your investigation. I 
have created a separate encrypted document with only the information that may be helpful, so that you can evaluate 
potentially relevant information while maintaining medical privacy. If the information in the airman file or the document I 
created turns out to be critical evidence for your case, then certified copies of the airman and/or medical file can be 
obtained at a later date. 
As I mentioned previously, I want to clarify some details regarding the helicopters. What I found appeared to be slightly 
different from what was included in the original e-mail to me below.

I have not yet been able to identify the serial number for N491GM which should lead to the registration documents. If you 
know who the aircraft was sold to, or what registration number it currently uses, I would be able to obtain those 
documents. 
Finally, does this surname have any relevance to your case (potential pilot of one of the aircraft)? VAN HEURCK

It was nice talking with you yesterday. Thanks for your assistance with this. Please see the below email of aircraft 
information. 
Below are the aircrafts we believe Maxwell has/had been using. The helicopter we know that she personally piloted, while 
the jets we know her to be a passenger. You'll notice some of the aircrafts will be associated with Jeffrey Epstein, as she 
traveled with him frequently. Any information you are able to provide would be helpful. If there is additional passenger 
manifests for each of these aircrafts we'd like to know that as well. I know we discussed that sometimes that's not 
available. As you can imagine, this case is high profile, so I appreciate any discretion you can make on your part. 
Please let me know if I left something out that would be able to assist you in any way.

Hi 
Unfortunately, I have class starting here in a few minutes, and grabbing those files from the docket took longer than I 
would have liked. 
Attached is where I was able to get to so far (I got through the bottom of page 5). I hope at least this was helpful. I have 
class until 9:10 tonight, so probably cannot circle back on this until tomorrow morning. Let me know if that would be 
helpful or if you need to get this done sooner. 
Sorry again for not being able to get through more of this.

There are prosecutors who would be afraid to charge a case that would require them to prove sex crimes that took place 
in 1994. If you want to find them, you'll have to go to Florida. This is the Southern District of New York. 
It is never too late for justice. Sometimes, you just have to have faith in the power of the truth and hope twelve jurors will 
do the right thing. At this trial, brave women will take the witness stand and the truth will come out: Ghislaine Maxwell 
sexually exploited underage girls. She caused unspeakable harm to vulnerable kids. It is time to hold her accountable. 
will open in the morning. Please come support. Details below. Updates to follow. 
Main courtroom: 40 Foley, courtroom 318 
Overflow courtrooms: 110, 506, 905, and 906. There is also a conference room on the first floor (room 130) that has a 
very small monitor with a live feed just for our office. 
Timing: we'll start at 8:30 a.m. with peremptory challenges, and we expect to go straight to preliminary instructions and 
opening statements. In order to get a seat, we'd recommend that you go over early.

either the prosecutors or the case agents, since we had previously contacted him, and she said she believed he had not

For context, we were in touch with Mr. 
several times in 2020 when he claimed to represent at least nine Epstein 
victims, all of which he said were unwilling to speak with us. He subsequently said one victim might be willing to speak 
with us, but then stopped responding to our requests for the complaints he had purportedly filed (but which we couldn't 
find online). I believe the last communication we had with him was the attached.

I think it's difficult to be that precise, just because we don't have great visibility into how many (and which) victims each 
lawyer represents. That said, we have consistently put every victims we're in touch with (including c/o their lawyers) into 
the victim contact list, so I think the best and most accurate number would be the 39 from VNS. I can't recall anybody 
who we spoke with who would have *not* been on the list at that time, though entirely possible that we were in touch 
with additional victims through counsel—we spoke to Brad Edwards, Robert Josefsberg, Robbie Kaplan, and Boies Schiller, 
all of whom have multiple victim clients, some of whom we don't know the identities of.

sent out 39 notices to all the victims listed in VNS. One woman wanted to come and missed her flight the evening before 
the hearing. I arranged another flight a 6:00AM the morning of the hearing and had a car waiting for her. She missed that 
flight too. I believe she was either Brad Edwards client or Singrid McCally. I don't remember her name but can get it she 
was a no show. Anyone that called and wanted to come was given a round trip ticket car service to and from the airport 
and hotel.

For the first question, the AUSAs contacted the attorneys we were aware of who represented victims to tell them that 
their clients were welcome to attend and to make a statement. I believe 
also sent out notifications, and hopefully 
she can tell us how many she sent. 
EFTA00017905
--- PAGE 2 ---
For the second question, based on my review of the transcript (attached), a total of 17 victims were present at the hearing 
and either spoke at the hearing or had someone read a statement for them. An additional 7 did not attend the hearing 
but had someone else speak for them or read a statement from them. It is possible there were others present who were 
not referenced on the record. 
I don't think we can answer the third question. I don't recall anyone off the top of my head who wanted to attend but 
was unable to, but it's possible there were some in that position.

The Petitioner in the Epstein CVRA case has filed an appeal to the 11th Circuit. One of their issues is the 
District Court's refusal to hold a hearing allowing the Epstein victims to "have their day in court." The 
Court's ruling is, in part, on the basis that a hearing held in SDNY satisfied this request. The Petitioner has 
alleged that not all of the Epstein victims who wanted to speak were able to do so at the New York hearing 
because they did not have sufficient notice and were unable to travel to NY. 
Can your office provide us some details about the following: 1) how many victims were contacted about 
making a victim impact statement; 2) how many victims were able to travel and make an in-person victim 
impact statement; and 3) how many victims indicated they wanted to make a victim impact statement but 
were unable to do so given the notice/timing of the hearing? 
Please provide as much of this information as possible today. I'm very sorry for the quick turnaround but 
the Department's response to the mandamus petition is due tomorrow. 
I really appreciate your assistance.

CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS CHARGED WITH FALSIFYING RECORDS 
ON AUGUST 9-10 AT THE METROPOLITAN CORRECTIONAL CENTER 
Defendants Allegedly Created Records Falsely Attesting to Required Checks of Inmates the 
Defendants Never Did in the Special Housing Unit on the Night Inmate Jeffrey Epstein 
Committed Suicide 
Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, 
Michael Horowitz, the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") Inspector General, and William F. 
Sweeney Jr., Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau 
of Investigation ("FBI"), announced today the unsealing of an indictment charging federal 
correctional officers TOVA NOEL and MICHAEL THOMAS with making false records and 
conspiring to make false records and to defraud the United States by impairing the lawful 
functions of the Metropolitan Correctional Center ("MCC"), a Manhattan detention facility that 
houses federal inmates. NOEL and THOMAS surrendered this morning. The case is assigned to 
Southern District of New York U.S. District Judge 
U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said: "As alleged, the defendants had a duty to ensure 
the safety and security of federal inmates in their care at the Metropolitan Correctional Center. 
Instead, they repeatedly failed to conduct mandated checks on inmates, and lied on official forms 
to hide their failures. These defendants will now be held accountable for their brazen attempt to 
shirk their responsibilities and conceal their conduct." 
DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz said: 
FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: 
EFTA00017912
--- PAGE 2 ---
According to the Indictment' filed today in Manhattan federal court: 
On August 10, 2019, NOEL and THOMAS repeatedly failed to complete mandated 
counts of prisoners under their watch in the MCC's Special Housing Unit ("SHU"). Instead, for 
substantial portions of their shifts, NOEL and THOMAS sat at their desk, browsed the intemet, 
and moved around the common area of the SHU. To conceal their failure to complete their 
duties, NOEL and THOMAS repeatedly signed false certifications attesting to having conducted 
multiple counts of inmates that they did not do. As a result of those false statements, the MCC 
believed prisoners in the SHU were being regularly monitored when, in fact, as a result of the 
defendants' conduct, no correctional officer conducted any count or round of the SHU from 
approximately 10:30 p.m. on August 9 until approximately 6:30 a.m. on August 10, at which 
time, NOEL and THOMAS discovered the body of MCC inmate Jeffrey Epstein, who had 
committed suicide while unobserved earlier that morning. 
Background on Relevant Individuals & Entities 
The MCC is a federal administrative detention facility located in Manhattan that is run by 
the Federal Bureau of Prisons. The MCC employs correctional officers, whose primary duty is 
to ensure the care, custody, and control of the inmate population of the MCC. NOEL has been 
employed as a correctional officer at the MCC since approximately 2016, and THOMAS has 
been employed as a correctional officer at the MCC since approximately 2007. Both NOEL and 
THOMAS were regularly assigned to work shifts in the SHU at the MCC. 
Correctional officers assigned to guard inmates in the SHU — and throughout the MCC —
are required to conduct institution-wide counts of inmates at regular, scheduled intervals to 
ensure that each inmate is alive and accounted for within the MCC. Two officers are required to 
complete the institutional count for each housing unit, including the SHU, and are further 
required to document their performance of the count on an official MCC form called a count slip. 
In addition to the institutional count, MCC correctional officers assigned to the SHU are required 
to complete rounds every thirty minutes to ensure that each inmate is alive and accounted for 
within his cell. Correctional officers working in the SHU are required to complete a form 
documenting the date and time of each 30-minute round in each area of the SHU. 
On July 6, 2019, Epstein was arrested and detained at the MCC on sex trafficking 
charges, and was subsequently assigned to the SHU due to risk factors for suicidality and safety 
concerns. After an apparent suicide attempt on July 23, 2019, Epstein was transferred to suicide 
watch and then psychological observation. Upon being moved back to the SHU on July 30, 
2019, the MCC took steps to guard against future suicide attempts by Epstein, including by 
assigning Epstein to the cell closest to the correctional officers' desk. Conducting the required 
institutional counts and thirty-minute rounds in the SHU were also part of the MCC's procedures 
for ensuring the safety of inmates, including Epstein. 
The Events of August 9-10, 2019 
On August 9, 2019, NOEL was assigned to work in the SHU from 4 p.m. on August 9, 
As the introductory phrase signifies, the entirety of the text of the Indictment, and the description of the Indictment 
set forth herein, constitute only allegations, and every fact described therein should be treated as an allegation. 
EFTA00017913
--- PAGE 3 ---
2019 to 8 a.m. on August 10, 2019. THOMAS was assigned to work with NOEL in the SHU 
from 12 a.m. until 8 a.m. on August 10, 2019. From 4 p.m. on August 9 to 8 a.m. on August 10, 
the officers on duty in the SHU, including NOEL and THOMAS, were responsible for 
conducting five institutional counts at 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. on August 9, and at 12 a.m., 3 a.m., 
and 5 a.m. on August 10. NOEL and THOMAS were also responsible for completing forms 
attesting to the completion of each of those counts. In fact, NOEL, and then NOEL and 
THOMAS, repeatedly failed to complete mandated counts in the SHU. Instead for substantial 
portions of their 12-8 a.m. shifts, in particular, NOEL and THOMAS sat at their desk, browsed 
the intemet, and moved around the common area of the SHU. During that time period, NOEL 
and THOMAS were the only correctional officers assigned to the SHU. Aside from two other 
officers who briefly visited the common area of the SHU, as confirmed by video surveillance, no 
one else entered the SHU, no one conducted any counts or rounds throughout the night, and no 
one entered the area in which Epstein was housed. 
To conceal their failure to complete their duties, NOEL signed false certifications 
attesting to having conducted counts of inmates at 4 p.m. and 10 p.m., and NOEL and THOMAS 
signed false certifications attesting to having conducted counts of inmates at 12 a.m., 3 a.m., and 
a.m. when, in truth and in fact, they never conducted such counts. As a result of those false 
reports, the MCC believed prisoners in the SHU were being regularly monitored and accounted 
for when, in fact, no correctional officer conducted any count or round of the SHU from 
approximately 10:30 p.m. on August 9 until approximately 6:30 a.m. on August 10, at which 
time, NOEL and THOMAS discovered the body of Epstein, who had committed suicide by 
hanging himself earlier that morning while unobserved. 
NOEL, 31, and THOMAS, 41, are each charged with one count of conspiring to defraud 
the United States by impairing, obstructing, and defeating the lawful functions of the MCC, and 
to make false records, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. NOEL is also 
charged with five counts of making false records, and THOMAS is also charged with three 
counts of making false records, each of which carries a maximum sentence of five years in 
prison. 
The statutory maximum and mandatory penalties are prescribed by Congress and are 
provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be 
determined by the judge. 
Mr. Berman praised the outstanding investigative work of DOJ OIG and the FBI. 
This case is bein handled b the Office's Public Corruption Unit. Assistant U.S. 
Attorneys 
are in charge of the prosecution. 
The charges contained in the Indictment are merely accusations. The defendants are 
presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

INTRODUCTION 
1. 
On or about August 10, 2019, TOVA NOEL and MICHAEL 
THOMAS, the defendants, in dereliction of their duties as 
correctional officers at the Metropolitan Correctional Center 
("MCC"), repeatedly failed to perform mandated counts of prisoners 
under their watch in the MCC's Special Housing Unit ("SHU"). 
Instead, for substantial portions of their shifts, NOEL and THOMAS 
sat at their desk, browsed the internet, and moved around the 
common area of the SHU. To conceal their failure to perform their 
duties, NOEL and THOMAS repeatedly signed false certifications 
attesting to having conducted multiple counts of inmates when, in 
truth and in fact, they never conducted such counts. As a result 
of those false statements, the MCC believed prisoners in the SHU 
were being regularly monitored'and accounted for when in fact, as 
a result of the defendants' conduct, no correctional officer 
conducted any count or round of the SHU from approximately 10:30 
EFTA00017915
--- PAGE 2 ---
p.m. on August 9 until approximately 6:30 a.m. on August 10, at 
which time, as alleged herein, NOEL and THOMAS discovered the body 
of an MCC inmate, Jeffrey Epstein, who had committed suicide 
overnight while unobserved. 
RELEVANT INDIVIDUALS AND ENTITIES 
2. 
The MCC is a federal administrative detention 
facility located in Manhattan that is run by the Federal Bureau of 
Prisons ("BOP"). The MCC is one of several facilities used to 
house inmates who have been charged with federal crimes in the 
Southern District of New York and are awaiting trial. 
The MCC 
employs correctional officers, whose primary duty is to ensure the 
care, custody, and control of the inmate population of the MCC. 
3. 
TOVA NOEL, the defendant, has been employed as a 
correctional officer at the MCC since approximately 2016. As of 
August 2019, NOEL's primary assignment was the SHU. On August 9, 
2019, NOEL worked a regular shift from 4 p.m. to 12 a.m. in the 
SHU, and then worked an overtime shift from 12 a.m. to 8 a.m. on 
August 10, 2019, also in the SHU. NOEL had also worked a regular 
shift in the SHU the day before, August 8, 2019, from 12 p.m. to 
p.m. 
4. 
MICHAEL THOMAS, the defendant, has been employed as 
a correctional officer at the MCC since approximately 2007. 
Beginning in approximately 2013, THOMAS was assigned to work as a 
EFTA00017916
--- PAGE 3 ---
materials handler supervisor, although THOMAS regularly worked 
overtime shifts as a correctional officer, including in the SHU. 
THOMAS worked an overtime shift in the SHU on August 10, 2019, 
from 12 a.m. to 8 a.m. THOMAS did not work his regular shift on 
August 8 or August 9, 2019, but did work an overtime shift in the 
SHU on August 9, 2019 from 12 a.m. to 8 a.m. 
5. 
As 
detailed 
herein, 
Jeffrey 
Epstein 
was 
incarcerated at the MCC between his arrest on July 6, 2019, and 
his suicide on August 10, 2019. 
Epstein was detained pending 
trial in the Southern District of New York on sex trafficking 
charges. 
THE MCC AND INSTITUTIONAL COUNTS 
6. 
The MCC, which houses approximately 750 inmates at 
any given time, assigns inmates to various housing units within 
the MCC. The SHU is a housing unit within the MCC where inmates 
are securely separated from the general inmate population to ensure 
their own safety as well as the safety of staff and other inmates. 
The SHU is located on the ninth floor of the MCC, and access to 
that floor is controlled by a locked door that can be opened 
remotely only by an officer in the MCC's centralized control center 
(the "Control Center"), which is located on the first floor of the 
MCC. Access into the SHU is also controlled by a second locked 
door to which only correctional officers assigned to the SHU have 
EFTA00017917
--- PAGE 4 ---
keys while on duty. Within the SHU, inmates are assigned to six 
separate tiers, each of which can be accessed only via a single 
locked door to which the correctional officers assigned to the SHU 
have keys while on duty. Each tier has eight cells, each of which 
can house either one or two prisoners, and each individual cell 
which is made of cement and metal - is accessed only through a 
single locked door, to which only correctional officers assigned 
to the SHU have keys while on duty. 
7. 
The BOP requires correctional officers assigned to 
guard inmates at the MCC to conduct institution-wide counts of 
inmates at regular, scheduled intervals to ensure that each inmate 
is alive and accounted for within the MCC (the "institutional 
count"). On weekdays, the MCC conducts five institutional counts 
at 4 p.m., 10 p.m., 12 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. 
Performing an 
institutional count is one of the most basic and essential aspects 
of a correctional officer's job, and the count is one of the most 
basic and essential functions of daily operation of the MCC. Two 
officers are required to perform the institutional count for each 
housing unit, including the SHU, and are further required to 
document their performance of the count on an official MCC form 
called a count slip. 
To perform the institutional count in the 
SHU, two officers must walk from tier to tier to observe and count 
each individual inmate. 
EFTA00017918
--- PAGE 5 ---
8. 
On the count slip, both correctional officers are 
required to fill in the date and time the count was performed, 
write the total number of inmates physically present in the unit 
counted, and then sign the count slip. 
Once the correctional 
officers have completed and signed the count slips, the count slips ' 
are then collected and delivered to the Control Center, where 
officers within the Control Center are responsible for comparing 
the count slips from each housing unit to the institution's inmate 
roster to ensure that each inmate is accounted for. Only after 
all the count slips are collected from each housing unit, and the 
numbers on the slips are matched to the institution's inmate 
roster, can the institutional count be deemed "cleared" or 
completed. 
If a housing unit's count slip is incorrect or 
incomplete, then the institution cannot "clear" the count. 
Instead, the count must be completely redone in that housing unit 
via a more-intensive version of the institutional count called a 
"bed book count," in which officers must compare every individual 
inmate to the institution's inmate roster. 
Records of each 
institutional count, including the count slips, are provided to a 
supervising official and retained by the MCC. 
9. In addition to the institutional count, the BOP 
requires correctional officers assigned to the SHU to walk each of 
the tiers of the SHU - which is called a "round" - every thirty 
EFTA00017919
--- PAGE 6 ---
minutes ("30-minute rounds"). 
Like the institutional counts, 
correctional officers conduct 30-minute rounds to ensure that each 
inmate is alive and accounted for within his cell. 
Correctional 
officers working in the SHU are required to complete a form, which 
is reviewed and signed by their supervisor, documenting the date 
and time of each 30-minute round in each tier of the SHU. 
EPSTEIN'S PRIOR APPARENT SUICIDE ATTEMPT 
10. On July 6, 2019, inmate Jeffrey Epstein was 
arrested and detained at the MCC on sex trafficking charges. On 
July 10, 2019, Epstein was assigned to the SHU due to, among other 
things, risk factors for suicidality and safety concerns relating 
to housing him with the MCC's general population. 
11. On July 23, 2019, while Epstein was housed in the 
SHU, MCC officers responded to an emergency call, and found Epstein 
on the floor of his cell with a strip of bedsheet around his neck. 
MICHAEL THOMAS, the defendant, was one of the MCC officers who 
responded to the incident. Epstein was subsequently transferred 
out of the SHU and was placed on suicide watch. 
Inmates placed 
on suicide watch are housed in a cell on the hospital wing floor 
of the MCC, and are watched twenty-four hours a day by a staff 
member or a specially trained inmate companion. 
12. Epstein remained on suicide watch for approximately 
twenty-four hours, and then was transferred to psychological 
EFTA00017920
--- PAGE 7 ---
observation, until July 30, 2019. 
Psychological observation is 
less restrictive than suicide watch, but inmates are still housed 
in the hospital wing of the MCC and watched twenty-four hours a 
day. 
13. On July 30, 2019, Epstein was transferred back to 
the SHU, and, at the direction of the MCC's psychological staff, 
was required to have an assigned cellmate. 
Epstein was also 
assigned to the cell closest to the correctional officers' desk in 
the common area of the SHU, which was approximately fifteen feet 
from the cell. Conducting the, required institutional counts and 
thirty-minute rounds in the SHU were also part of the MCC's 
procedures for ensuring the safety of inmates, including Epstein. 
EVENTS OF AUGUST 9-10, 2019 
14. On 
August 
9, 
2019, 
Epstein's 
cellmate 
was 
transferred out of the MCC in a routine, pre-arranged transfer at 
approximately 8 a.m. 
Despite the MCC's psychological staff's 
direction that Epstein have a cellmate, no new cellmati was 
assigned to Epstein's cell. 
15. TOVA NOEL, the defendant, was one of the assigned 
officers on duty in the SHU from 4 p.m. on August 9, 2019 to 8 
a.m. on August 10. 
From 4 p.m. to 12 a.m., two other officers 
were on duty with NOEL in the SHU: one officer was assigned to 
work from 2 p.m. to 10 p.m. ("Officer-1"), and one officer was 
EFTA00017921
--- PAGE 8 ---
assigned to work from 4 p.m. to 12 a.m. ("Officer-2"). MICHAEL 
THOMAS, the defendant, started his shift in the SHU at 12 a.m. on 
August 10. From 12 a.m. until 8 a.m. on August 10, NOEL and THOMAS 
were the only two officers on duty in the SHU. 
16. During the time period from 4 p.m. on August 9 to 
a.m. on August 10, the officers on duty in the SHU, including 
TOVA NOEL and MICHAEL THOMAS, the defendants, were responsible for 
conducting five institutional counts: 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. on August 
9; and 12 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. on August 10. NOEL, THOMAS and 
the other officers on duty were also responsible for completing 
paperwork attesting to each of those counts. While, as detailed 
herein, count slips were completed for each institutional count, 
in fact, not a single one of those institutional counts was done. 
17. TOVA NOEL, the defendant, and Officer-1 were 
responsible for conducting the 4 p.m. institutional count in the 
SHU. As video from the MCC's internal video surveillance system 
makes clear, NOEL and Officer-1 did not perform the 4 p.m. count. 
Nonetheless; NOEL and Officer-1 completed and signed a count slip 
that falsely stated that the 4 p.m. institutional count had been 
performed. 
In reliance on that falsified count slip, at 
approximately 5:03 p.m., the Control Center cleared the 4 p.m. 
count. 
EFTA00017922
--- PAGE 9 ---
18. That evening, Epstein returned to the SHU from his 
attorney visit and was escorted into his cell by TOVA NOEL, the 
defendant, and another officer at approximately 7:49 p.m. 
NOEL 
and the other officer left the tier in which Epstein was housed 
immediately thereafter. 
19. By or before 10 p.m., all inmates in the MCC were 
locked in their cells for the night. At or around that time, TOVA 
NOEL, the defendant, and Officer-2 were responsible for conducting 
the 10 p.m. institutional count in the SHU. However, video from 
the MCC's internal video surveillance system shows that NOEL and 
Officer-2 did not perform the 10 p.m. count. 
Nonetheless, NOEL 
and Officer-2 completed and signed a count slip falsely stating 
that the 10 p.m. institutional count had been performed. 
In 
reliance on that falsified count slip, at approximately 10:36 p.m., 
the Control Center cleared the 10 p.m. count. 
20. As reflected on video obtained from the MCC's 
internal video surveillance system, at approximately 10:30 p.m. on 
August 9, 2019 - after' TOVA NOEL, the defendant, had signed and 
submitted the 10 p.m. count slip and the institutional count had 
been completed - NOEL briefly walked up to, and then walked back 
from, the door to the tier in which Epstein was housed. 
As 
confirmed by the video obtained from the MCC's internal video 
surveillance system, this was the last time anyone, including any 
EFTA00017923
--- PAGE 10 ---
correctional officer, walked up to, let alone entered, the only 
entrance to the tier in which Epstein 
was housed until 
approximately 6:30 a.m. on August 10. 
21. Officer-l's shift ended at approximately 10 p.m., 
and at approximately 12 a.m., MICHAEL THOMAS, the defendant, 
replaced Officer-2, joining TOVA NOEL, the defendant, as the only 
two correctional officers on duty in the SHU. 
NOEL and THOMAS 
were responsible for conducting the 12 a.m. institutional count in 
the SHU. 
As confirmed by video from the MCC's internal video 
surveillance system, NOEL and THOMAS did not perform the 12 a.m. 
count. Nonetheless, NOEL and THOMAS completed and signed a count 
slip for the 12 a.m. count that falsely stated that the 
institutional count had been performed. 
In reliance on that 
falsified count slip, at approximately 12:49 a.m., the Control 
Center cleared the 12 a.m. count. 
22. TOVA NOEL and MICHAEL THOMAS, the defendants, were 
additionally responsible for conducting the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. 
institutional counts in the SHU. As confirmed by video from the 
MCC's internal video surveillance system, NOEL and THOMAS did not 
perform either the 3 a.m. or the 5 a.m. counts. NOEL and THOMAS 
nonetheless completed and signed count slips for both counts that 
falsely stated that they had performed the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. 
institutional counts. In reliance on those falsified count slips, 
EFTA00017924
--- PAGE 11 ---
at approximately 3:24 a.m. and 5:30 a.m., the Control Center 
cleared the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. counts, respectively. 
23. Moreover, despite the requirement that officers on 
duty in the SHU conduct and document regular, 30-minute rounds, 
TOVA NOEL and MICHAEL THOMAS, the defendants, did not perform any 
of the required 30-minute rounds during their shift between 
approximately 12 a.m. and 6:30 a.m. Nonetheless, NOEL completed 
and signed more than 75 separate 30-minute round entries falsely 
affirming that they had, in fact, conducted such rounds. 
24. During the night, instead of completing the 
required counts and rounds, TOVA NOEL and MICHAEL THOMAS, the 
defendants, were seated at the correctional officers' desk in the 
SHU common area (as noted above, approximately 15 feet from 
Epstein's cell), used the computers, and moved around the SHU 
common area. 
For a period of approximately two hours, NOEL and 
THOMAS sat at their desk without moving, and appeared to have been 
asleep. NOEL used the computer periodically throughout the night, 
including to search the internet for furniture sales and benefit 
websites. THOMAS used the computer briefly around 1 a.m., 4 a.m., 
and 6 a.m. to search for motorcycle sales and sports news. 
25. At approximately 4 a.m., the overnight supervisor 
briefly visited NOEL and THOMAS in the SHU, and conferred with 
NOEL and THOMAS, who were seated at and around the officers' desk, 
EFTA00017925
--- PAGE 12 ---
before leaving. At approximately 5:30 a.m., another correctional 
officer briefly walked through the SHU common area. 
Aside from 
those two officers, as confirmed by video surveillance, no one 
else entered the SHU, no one conducted any counts or rounds 
throughout the night, and no one entered the tier in which Epstein 
was housed. 
26. Shortly after 6 a.m. on August 10, 2019, MICHAEL 
THOMAS and TOVA NOEL, the defendants, received a delivery of 
breakfast carts into the SHU, after which time they were again the 
only officers in the SHU. Shortly after 6:30 a.m., NOEL and THOMAS 
walked up to and entered the tier in which Epstein was housed to 
serve breakfast. 
At approximately 6:33 a.m., an alarm was 
activated in the SHU. 
Epstein was alone in his cell and not 
responsive, with a noose around his neck. 
A supervisor who had 
just started his shift ("Supervisor-1") responded to the alarm 
almost immediately thereafter, and as NOEL approached the door to 
the SHU to open the door for Supervisor-1, NOEL told Supervisor-1 
that "Epstein hung himself." 
After arriving in the SHU, 
Supervisor-1 spoke with THOMAS and NOEL. 
NOEL told Supervisor-1 
"we did not complete the 3 a.m. nor 5 a.m. rounds." THOMAS stated, 
"we messed up," and "I messed up, she's not to blame, we didn't do 
any rounds." 
EFTA00017926
--- PAGE 13 ---
27. Epstein was transferred to a local hospital where 
he was declared dead shortly thereafter. The Office of the Chief 
Medical Examiner of the City of New York conducted an autopsy and 
determined that Epstein had committed suicide by hanging himself.

METROPOLITAN CORRECTIONAL CENTER 
UNITED STATES ATTORNEY'S OFFICE 
Southern District of New York 
CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS CHARGED WITH FALSIFYING RECORDS ON 
AUGUST 9TH AND 10TH AT THE METROPOLITAN CORRECTIONAL CENTER 
Defendants Allegedly Created Records Falsely Attesting to Required Checks of Inmates the Defendants Never 
Did in the Special Housing Unit on the Night Inmate Jeffiwy Epstein Committed Suicide 
Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Guido Modano, 
Special Agent in Charge of the Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General, New York Field Office 
("DOJ OIG"), and William F. Sweeney Jr., Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI"), announced today the unsealing of an indictment charging federal 
correctional officers TOVA NOEL and MICHAEL THOMAS with making false records and conspiring to make 
false records and to defraud the United States by impairing the lawful functions of the Metropolitan Correctional 
Center ("MCC"), a Manhattan detention facility that houses federal inmates. NOEL and THOMAS surrendered 
this morning. The case is assigned to Southern District of New York U.S. District Judge Analisa Tones. 
U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said: "As alleged, the defendants had a duty to ensure the safety and 
security of federal inmates in their care at the Metropolitan Correctional Center. Instead, they repeatedly failed 
EFTA00017935
--- PAGE 2 ---
to conduct mandated checks on inmates, and lied on official forms to hide their dereliction." 
DOJ OIG Special Agent in Charge Guido Modano said: "Correctional Officers swear an oath to carry out 
their duties. Completing rounds to verify inmate counts and certifying the accuracy of logs are important tasks 
to ensure the safety and security of institutions and the wellbeing of inmates. Those who shirk their duties but 
falsely state they have completed them place the institution, fellow employees, inmates, and the public at risk." 
FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Security protocols are in place to protect the public, 
fellow officers and inmates being held in the MCC. We allege these officers falsified records to create the 
appearance they were following those protocols. The security risks created by this type of behavior are 
immense. The message here is simple - citizens place their trust in those who have taken an oath to serve and 
protect the public, and when that trust is deliberately violated by public servants, who instead choose to break 
those regulations, then they will be held accountable." 
According to the Indictment[l I filed today in Manhattan federal court: 
On August 10, 2019, NOEL and THOMAS repeatedly failed to complete mandated counts of prisoners 
under their watch in the MCC's Special Housing Unit ("SHU"). Instead, for substantial portions of their shifts, 
NOEL and THOMAS sat at their desk, browsed the intemet, and moved around the common area of the SHU. 
To conceal their failure to perform their duties, NOEL and THOMAS repeatedly signed false certifications 
attesting to having conducted multiple counts of inmates that they did not do. As a result of those false 
statements, the MCC believed prisoners in the SHU were being regularly monitored when, in fact, as a result of 
the defendants' conduct, no correctional officer conducted any count or round of the SHU from approximately 
10:30 p.m. on August 9 until approximately 6:30 a.m. on August 10, at which time, NOEL and THOMAS 
discovered the body of MCC inmate Jeffrey Epstein, who had committed suicide overnight while unobserved. 
Background on Relevant Individuals & Entities 
The MCC is a federal administrative detention facility located in Manhattan that is run by the Federal 
Bureau of prisons. The MCC employs correctional officers, whose primary duty is to ensure the care, custody, 
and control of the inmate population of the MCC. NOEL has been employed as a correctional officer at the 
MCC since approximately 2016, and THOMAS has been employed as a correctional officer at the MCC since 
approximately 2007. Both NOEL and THOMAS were regularly assigned to work shifts in the SHU at the 
MCC. 
Correctional officers assigned to guard inmates in the SHU — and throughout the MCC — are required to 
conduct institution-wide counts of inmates at regular, scheduled intervals to ensure that each inmate is alive and 
accounted for within the MCC. Two officers are required to complete the institutional count for each housing 
unit, including the SHU, and are further required to document their performance of the count on an official MCC 
form called a count slip. In addition to the institutional count, MCC correctional officers assigned to the SHU 
are required to complete rounds every thirty minutes to ensure that each inmate is alive and accounted for within 
his cell. Correctional officers working in the SHU are required to complete a form documenting the date and 
time of each 30-minute round in each area of the SHU. 
On July 6, 2019, Epstein was arrested and detained at the MCC on sex trafficking charges, and was 
subsequently assigned to the SHU due to risk factors for suicidality and safety concerns. After an apparent 
suicide attempt on July 23, 2019, Epstein was transferred to suicide watch and then psychological observation. 
Upon being moved back to the SHU on July 30, 2019, the MCC took steps to guard against future suicide 
attempts by Epstein, including by assigning Epstein to the cell closest to the correctional officers' desk. 
Conducting the required institutional counts and thirty-minute rounds in the SHU were also part of the MCC's 
procedures for ensuring the safety of inmates, including Epstein. 
The Events ofAugust 9-10, 2019 
EFTA00017936
--- PAGE 3 ---
On August 9, 2019, NOEL was assigned to work in the SHU from 4:00 p.m. on August 9, 2019, to 8:00 
a.m. on August 10, 2019. THOMAS was assigned to work with NOEL in the SHU from 12:00 a.m. until 8:00 
a.m. on August 10, 2019. From 4:00 p.m. on August 9 to 8:00 a.m. on August 10, the officers on duty in the 
SHU, including NOEL and THOMAS, were responsible for conducting five institutional counts at 4:00 p.m. and 
10:00 p.m. on August 9, and at 12:00 a.m., 3:00 a.m., and 5:00 a.m. on August 10. NOEL and THOMAS were 
also responsible for completing forms attesting to the completion of each of those counts. In fact, NOEL, and 
then NOEL and THOMAS, repeatedly failed to complete mandated counts in the SHU. Instead for substantial 
portions of their 12:00-8:00 a.m. shifts, NOEL and THOMAS sat at their desk, browsed the intemet, and moved 
around the common area of the SHU. During that time period, NOEL and THOMAS were the only correctional 
officers assigned to the SHU. Aside from two other officers who briefly visited the common area of the SHU, as 
confirmed by video surveillance, no one else entered the SHU, no one conducted any counts or rounds 
throughout the night, and no one entered the area in which Epstein was housed. 
To conceal their failure to complete their duties, NOEL signed false certifications attesting to having 
conducted counts of inmates at 4:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m., and NOEL and THOMAS signed false certifications 
attesting to having conducted counts of inmates at 12:00 a.m., 3:00 a.m., and 5:00 a.m. when, in truth and in fact, 
they never conducted such counts. As a result of those false reports, the MCC believed prisoners in the SHU 
were being regularly monitored and accounted for when, in fact, no correctional officer conducted any count or 
round of the SHU from approximately 10:30 p.m. on August 9 until approximately 6:30 a.m. on August 10, at 
which time, NOEL and THOMAS discovered the body of Epstein, who had committed suicide by hanging 
himself earlier that morning while unobserved. 
NOEL, 31, and THOMAS, 41, are each charged with one count of conspiring to defraud the United 
States by impairing, obstructing, and defeating the lawful functions of the MCC, and to make false records, 
which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. NOEL is also charged with five counts of making 
false records, and THOMAS is also charged with three counts of making false records, each of which carries a 
maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
The statutory maximum and mandatory penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for 
informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendants would be determined by the judge. 
Mr. Berman praised the outstanding investigative work of the Office of the Inspector General, the FBI, 
and the New York City Police Department. 
This case is being handled by the Office's Public Corruption Unit. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Rebekah 
Donaleski and Nicolas Roos are in charge of the prosecution. 
The charges contained in the Indictment are merely accusations. The defendants are presumed innocent 
unless and until proven guilty.

It appears to us to be materials from a crazy person and, as such, does not need to be produced. That said, there's likely 
no harm in producing it to the defense. We are inclined to not produce it, but we wanted to run it by you first. Thoughts?

Technical Update: 
At 12:30 pm today I met
, the new Acting Warden of the MCC. Due to the transition of personnel at the 
MCC there has been some miscommunication between the MCC, the FBI, and the video surveillance vendor 
Nice Vision. After speaking with NYO EM and then talking with 
, the following is the plan to extract all 
relevant video surveillance from the MCC, which also allows for the MCC to maintain a video surveillance system for 
security purposes. 
As a quick background, the MCC has two (2) DVR surveillance systems which provide coverage for the entirety of 
EFTA00017950
--- PAGE 2 ---
the facility. Each system, DVR system #1 and DVR system #2, contain sixteen (16) hard drives which recorded the 
activity captured by the associated cameras. According to MCC staff, on 07/29/19, DVR system #2 had two to three 
hard drives fail causing most of that system to stop recording. Two of the three camera feeds of obvious interest 
resided on DVR system #2, meaning they were not recording at the time of the suicide on 08/10/19. Long before the 
hard drive failures and the suicide of the subject, the MCC had contracted with NiceVision to replace the antiquated 
system being utilized by the facility. NiceVision arrived at the MCC on Monday 08/12/19 to begin work on the 
installation. NiceVision has not completed the work on the system because they have not had access to the equipment 
room since FAVU arrived later that same day to export video from a camera feed on the working DVR system #1. 
After consultation with NYO CART and OTD, it has been determined the best chance for the FBI to extract and 
review video surveillance footage is to remove DVR system #2 immediately. 
This system is currently being extracted with the permission of MCC Acting Warden 
A member of NY 
CART will transport this system down to OTD today where a team from DFAS-DSAU will be waiting to receive and 
attempt a rebuild of the failed hard drives. This will be necessary in order for us to reconstitute the system later when 
we receive DVR system #1 at OTD. 
Another team from FBI FAVU is currently on-site working on exporting video from the third camera of interest 
connected to DVR system #1, which is currently operational and being utilized by the MCC. We will continue to 
export video from this camera back through at least 07/23/19, the date of the first alleged suicide attempt. Review has 
begun on this camera by C-19 and SDNY. At the same time C-19 will maintain a 24-7 presence in the equipment 
room to ensure integrity of the system and to also allow access for simultaneous work by NiceVision to complete the 
install of the new video surveillance system. NiceVision is currently once again working on the install and estimated a 
completion of the work as early as tomorrow (8/15/19). Once the new system is operational and FAVU has completed 
the download from the one known camera of interest residing on DVR system #1, we will collect it and send that 
down to OTD. We anticipate we could send down DVR system #1 down within the next two days. This will 
potentially allow us to reconstitute both systems down at OTD where we can determine what video is present. Then 
we will review the entirety of the recorded video surveillance for evidentiary purposes. 
It should be noted that the 30 day over-write in these systems were suspended for DVR system #1 and DVR system 
#2 on 08/12/19 and 08/10/19, respectively. Also of note, beside the attempt to rebuild the failed hard drives, there is a 
significant chance the hard drives pulled from DVR #2 on 08/10/19, are corrupted and/or encrypted since they were 
extracted while the system was running. We will know more about this issue once we can reconstitute the system and 
review. It is estimated the work described in this communication may take several weeks to complete. After all efforts 
have been made the possibility exists the rebuild of the hard drives and reconstitution of the systems may ultimately 
fail to produce the desired outcome.

The Honorable Kenneth M. Karas 
United States District Judge 
Southern District of New York 
300 Quarropas Street 
White Plains, NY 10601 
Re: 
United States v. Nicholas Tartaglione, S4 16 Cr. 832 (KMK) 
Dear Judge Karas: 
The Government respectfully submits this letter to provide a further update to the Court 
regarding the defense's request for video footage from outside the defendant's cell at the 
Metropolitan Correctional Center ("MCC") on July 22 — July 23, 2019. 
On or about December 
19, 2019, the Government informed the Court and defense counsel that it had confirmed with MCC 
staff that the requested video had been preserved, and that the Government was working to obtain 
a copy from MCC. As set forth in greater detail below, the Government has learned that the MCC 
inadvertently preserved video from the wrong tier within the MCC, and, as a result, video from 
outside the defendant's cell on July 22 — 23, 2019 (Le. the requested video) no longer exists. 
On or about July 23, 2019, at approximately 1:27 a.m., MCC corrections officers responded 
to the cell ("Cell-1") that the defendant shared with Jeffrey Epstein. On or about July 25, 2019, 
defense counsel requested that MCC preserve video footage from outside the defendant's cell from 
July 22, 2019 at 11:00 p.m. through July 23, 2019 at 4:00 a.m. From speaking with MCC legal 
counsel, the Government understands that in response to this request, MCC legal counsel looked 
up the defendant's cell number in the MCC computer system and thereafter requested that MCC 
staff preserve video from outside of that cell for the requested time period. An MCC staff member 
confirmed that the video had been preserved. 
On or about January 3, 2020, the MCC provided the Government with a copy of the video 
that it had preserved, which the Government then converted into a playable format. After 
reviewing the video, it appeared to the Government that the footage contained on the preserved 
video was for the correct date and time, but captured a different tier than the one where Cell-1 was 
located because the preserved video did not show corrections officers responding to any of the 
cells seen on the video. After speaking with MCC legal counsel, the Government was informed 
that the MCC computer system listed a different, incorrect cell for Tartaglione ("Cell-2"). 
Therefore, when MCC legal counsel asked that the video outside of the defendant's cell be 
preserved, the MCC preserved video outside of Cell-2 instead of Cell-1. 
EFTA00017953

January 9, 2020 
Page 2 of 2 
The Government understands from speaking with MCC legal counsel that there was a 
backup system in place that housed all video for the Special Housing Unit, including the video 
requested by defense counsel. The Government further understands from the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation that it has reviewed that backup system as part of an unrelated investigation and 
determined that the requested video no longer exists on the backup system and has not since at 
least August 2019 as a result of technical errors. 
The Government will make the video of the tier containing Cell-2 available for defense 
counsel's review at the United States Attorney's Office.

The Government respectfully submits this letter to update the Court regarding the defense's 
request for certain video footage from inside the Metropolitan Correctional Center ("MCC") on 
July 22 — July 23, 2019 (the "Video"). Earlier today, the Government confirmed with MCC staff 
that the Video was preserved by MCC staff upon defense counsel's request in July 2019, and the 
Government is in the process of obtaining a copy of the Video from the MCC. Once the 
Government obtains a copy of the Video, the Government intends to make it available for defense 
counsel's review at the United States Attorney's Office.

We just wanted to check in very briefly—we had been hopeful that we'd be able to circle back with you earlier, but our 
investigation is currently still ongoing, so at the very least we wanted to let you know that we continue to appreciate 
both your client's prior assistance and her willingness to assist in the future. Nothing in our investigation since we 
were last substantively in touch has changed our view of your client, and we hope to be able to be in touch with you in 
the coming weeks with an update. In the interim, we do continue to view her status as we've previously conveyed, 
and please let us know if any issues arise on your end. 
thank you,

Joe, 
We just wanted to check in very briefly—we had been hopeful that we'd be able to circle back with you earlier, but our 
investigation is currently still ongoing, so at the very least we wanted to let you know that we continue to appreciate 
both your client's prior assistance and her willingness to assist in the future. Nothing in our investigation since we 
were last substantively in touch has changed our view of your client, and we hope to be able to be in touch with you in 
the coming weeks with an update. In the interim, we do continue to view her status as we've previously conveyed, 
and please let us know if any issues arise on your end. 
thank you,

Southern District of New York 
New York, NY 10007 
Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
Discovery request pertaining to FOIA productions 
Dear Counsel: 
I write to request certain discovery pursuant to Fed. R. Cr. P. 16. 
Haddon, Morgan and Foreman, e c 
Laura A. Menninger 
Denver Colorado 80203 
www.hmflow.com 
Under Rule 16(a)(1)(E), I ask that you provide to us the documents produced by the FBI to 
news media, as described in Radar Online v. FBI, 17 Civ. 3956 (PGG). The FBI in New York 
released to Radar Online some 1,232 pages "relating to the FBI's investigation and 
prosecution of Jeffrey Edward Epstein." Id. at Dkt. 25, p. 1. According to a letter signed by 
your office, 181 pages were released in full and 1,051 were released with partial redactions. 
Id. at 2. Your office made these representations and therefore presumably is aware of the 
documents' existence and constructively aware that their contents relate to the FBI 
investigation and prosecution of Jeffrey Edward Epstein and relate to the investigation and 
prosecution of Ghislaine Maxwell. We perceive no legal basis for you to refuse to produce 
the records; the records have previously been released to a news media outlet, "relate to" the 
investigation and prosecution of Ms. Maxwell's alleged co-conspirator, and are in the 
government's "possession, custody, or control." 
We also request that your office detail when each batch of documents, by Bates number or 
some other identifier, were released to Radar Online. The public availability of, for example, 
witness statements and other investigative materials is relevant to this case because we believe 
there have been efforts by certain witnesses to conform their testimony to the public 
statements and police reports made by other witnesses. It is relevant and material to Ms. 
Maxwell's defense to know when the FBI made any such witness statements (even if 
redacted) or other materials available to a tabloid news organization. 
EFTA00017995
--- PAGE 2 ---
March 8, 2021 
Page 2 
Further, we request that you make inquiry of your "Prosecution Team," to include the USAO-
SDNY, FBI-New York Office, and FBI Florida Office, regarding any other FOIA requests 
that have produced documents pertaining to any investigation of Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine 
Maxwell and produce to us the documents made public through the FOIA requests, the dates 
the documents were produced and the identity of the recipient of the documents. 
Finally, in your letter to Judge Nathan of October 7, 2020, you represented that your 
"Prosecution Team ... had no involvement in the Florida Investigation." (Dkt. 63 at 4.) You 
defined your "Prosecution Team" to include not only of the USAO-SDNY but also the FBI-
New York Office. We believe that the FBI-New York Office participated in the USAO-SDFL 
investigation by, inter alia, arranging for interviews and testimony of certain New York 
witnesses between 2005 and 2010. We urge you to look again at your files to ascertain 
whether your statement to Judge Nathan was accurate and to produce any materials that reflect 
the involvement of the FBI-New York Office in the USAO-SDFL investigation. 
Given that we are rapidly approaching trial, I ask that you please provide these materials by 
the end of the week, March 15, 2021. 
Respectfully submitted.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 
Defendant. 
INSTRUCTIONS TO FOCUS GROUP 
EFTA00018008
--- PAGE 2 ---
Summary of Indictment 
The Indictment contains three counts. or "charges," against GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 
the defendant. 
Count One of the Indictment charges the defendant, with conspiring—that is, agreeing—
with others to transport a minor in interstate and foreign commerce, with intent that the minor 
engage in sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense. Count One 
relates to multiple minor victims during the time period 1994 to 2004. 
Count Two of the Indictment charges the defendant with conspiring to engage in sex 
trafficking of minors. Count Two relates to multiple minor victims during the time period 2001 
to 2004. 
Count Three of the Indictment charges the defendant with sex trafficking of minors. 
Count Three relates to Minor Victim-4, during the time period 2001 to 2004. 
EFTA00018009
--- PAGE 3 ---
Burden of Proof and Multiple Counts 
In a moment, I will describe those three counts in more detail. Before I do, however, let 
me explain that the Government has the burden of proving the defendant's guilt on each count by 
a preponderance of the evidence. That means that the Government must show that it is more 
likely than not that the defendant is guilty of each count. 
You must consider each count separately and return a separate verdict of guilty or not 
guilty for each. Whether you find the defendant guilty or not guilty as to one offense should not 
affect your verdict as to any other offense charged. 
You have no doubt heard that a defendant's guilt in a criminal case must be proved 
beyond a reasonable doubt. That is not the standard we are applying in today's exercise. As I 
said, the question for you today is whether it is more likely than not that the defendant is guilty 
of each count. 
EFTA00018010
--- PAGE 4 ---
Count One: Conspiracy to Transport Minors 
As I mentioned, Count One of the Indictment charges the defendant with conspiracy to 
transport minors between 1994 and 2004. 
In order to satisfy its burden of proof with respect to the allegation of conspiracy, the 
Government must establish each of the following elements: 
First, the existence of the conspiracy charged in the Indictment; that is, as to Count One, a 
conspiracy to transport a minor with intent that the minor engage in sexual activity for which a 
person can be charged with a criminal offense. You should know that a conspiracy just means that 
the defendant you are considering agreed with at least one other person to violate the law. 
Second, that the defendant intentionally and knowingly became a member of the 
conspiracy. That is, she knowingly participated in the conspiracy with knowledge of its object 
and with an intent to further the aims of the conspiracy. The defendant's mere presence at the 
scene of the alleged crime does not, by itself, make her a member of the conspiracy. Similarly, 
mere knowledge or acquiescence, without participation, in the unlawful plan is not sufficient. In 
other words, knowledge without agreement and participation is not sufficient. On the other 
hand, it is not necessary for the Government to show that a defendant was fully informed as to all 
the details of the conspiracy in order for you to infer knowledge on her part, and it does not 
matter whether the defendant's role in the conspiracy may have been more limited than or 
different in nature or in length of time from the roles of her co-conspirators, provided she was 
herself a participant. 
With respect to Count One, in order to sustain the charge that the defendant conspired to 
transport an individual with intent that the person engage in sexual activity for which a person can 
be charged with a criminal offense, the Government must prove that the purpose of the conspiracy 
was to transport an individual with intent that the individual engage in sexual activity for which a 
EFTA00018011
--- PAGE 5 ---
person can be charged with a criminal offense, which contains three elements: 
First, that the defendant knowingly transported an individual in interstate or foreign 
commerce. This means that the Government must prove that the defendant knew both that she 
was causing the individual to be transported, and that the individual was being transported in 
interstate commerce. The Government does not have to prove that the defendant personally 
transported the individual across a state line or international border. It is sufficient to satisfy this 
element that the defendant acted through an agent or was engaged in the making of the travel 
arrangements, such as by purchasing tickets necessary for the individual to travel as planned. 
Second, that the defendant transported the individual with the intent that the individual 
engage in any sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense. Count 
One alleges sexual activity for which a person could be charged with a crime under the criminal 
law of New York. Specifically, a person commits sexual abuse of a minor in the third degree 
when he or she subjects another person to sexual contact without the latter's consent. Under New 
York law, "sexual contact" means any touching of the sexual or other intimate parts of a person 
for the purpose of gratifying the sexual desire of either party. Also under New York law, a person 
less than seventeen years old is incapable of consent. 
Third, the individual must be less than seventeen years old, and the defendant must know 
that the individual is less than seventeen years old. 
It is not a defense to the crime of sexual abuse of a minor in the third degree that the minor 
voluntarily participated or consented. 
EFTA00018012
--- PAGE 6 ---
Count Two: Conspiracy to Commit Sex Trafficking 
Count Two charges the defendant with conspiracy to commit sex trafficking between 2001 
and 2004. 
As with Count One, in order to satisfy its burden of proof with respect to the allegation of 
conspiracy, the Government must establish the following elements: 
First, the existence of the conspiracy charged in the Indictment; that is, as to Count Two, a 
conspiracy to commit sex trafficking. 
Second, that the defendant intentionally and knowingly became a member of the 
conspiracy. That is, she knowingly participated in the conspiracy with knowledge of its object 
and with an intent to further the aims of the conspiracy. 
With respect to Count Two, in order to sustain the charge that the defendant conspired to 
commit sex trafficking, the Government must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the 
purpose of the conspiracy was to commit sex trafficking, which contains four elements: 
First The defendant knowingly recruited, enticed, harbored, transported, provided, or 
obtained a person. Those terms have their ordinary, everyday meanings. 
Second: The defendant knew that the person was under the age of eighteen years. 
Third: The defendant knew the person would be caused to engage in a commercial sex 
act. The term "commercial sex act" means "any sex act, on account of which anything of value 
is given to or received by any person." The thing of value may be money or any other tangible 
or intangible thing of value that may be given to or received by any person, regardless of whether 
the person who receives it is the person performing the commercial sex act. It is not required 
that the person actually have performed a commercial sex act, and it is not a defense that the 
person consented. 
Fourth: The defendant's acts were in or affecting interstate commerce. I instruct you 
EFTA00018013
--- PAGE 7 ---
that acts and transactions that cross state lines, or which affect the flow of money in the stream of 
commerce to any degree, however minimal, are acts and transactions affecting interstate 
commerce. For instance, it affects interstate commerce to use products that traveled in interstate 
commerce. Proof of actual travel is not required. 
EFTA00018014
--- PAGE 8 ---
Count Three: Sex Trafficking of Minor Victim-4 
Count Three charges the defendant with the sex trafficking of Minor Victim-4 between 
2001 and 2004. I have just reviewed the four elements of sex trafficking with you. In order to 
satisfy its burden of proof with respect to Count Three, the Government must establish by a 
preponderance of the evidence that the defendant committed those elements in the sex trafficking 
of Minor Victim-4. 
In addition, you may find the defendant guilty of Count Three under a them of 
liability called "aiding and abetting," which permits a defendant to be convicted of a specified 
crime if the defendant, while not herself committing the crime, assisted another person or 
persons in committing the crime. To aid or abet another to commit a crime, it is necessary that 
the Government prove that the defendant willfully and knowingly associated herself in some way 
with the crime committed by the other person and willfully and knowingly sought by some act to 
help the crime succeed.

DATE FILED: 12/8/20 
20-CR-330 (MN) 
ORDER 
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
On December 4, 2020, the Court received a letter from MDC legal counsel responding to 
the concerns that the Defendant raised in her November 24, 2020 letter. See Dkt. Nos. 75, 88; 
see also Dkt. No. 78. The Defendant responded to the MDC legal counsel's letter on December 
7, 2020, reiterating her request that the Court summon Warden Heriberto Tellez to personally 
respond to questions from the Court regarding the Defendant's conditions of confinement. See 
Dkt. No. 91. Having carefully reviewed the parties' submissions, along with the MDC legal 
counsel's December 4, 2020 letter, the Court DENIES the Defendant's request to summon the 
Warden to personally appear and respond to questions. This resolves Dkt. No. 75. 
Notwithstanding this, as originally provided in Dkt. No. 49, the Government shall 
continue to submit written status updates detailing any material changes to the conditions of Ms. 
Maxwell's confinement, with particular emphasis on her access to legal materials, including 
legal mail and email, and her ability to communicate with defense counsel. The updates shall 
also include information on the frequency of searches of the Defendant. 
The Court hereby ORDERS the Government to submit these written updates every 60 
days. Furthermore, the Government shall take all necessary steps to ensure that the Defendant

Our client has requested that we cancel tomorrow's meeting. She has now had to recount her interactions with 
Epstein one too many times, and since it's her understanding that it's unlikely that any of her information would 
in fact materially advance your current prosecutions, she'd prefer to forego another interview. 
Hope that's ok on your end, and of course let us know if you have any questions at all.

Hey 
As discussed, I reviewed all the travel records you sent. Unfortunately, the outbound travel records were not recorded in 
CBP database during that time (between 1990-2000) as they are today. In short, the TECS travel records you have for 
Maxwell and Epstein are all we have in CBP holdings so there's nothing further I can provide for that date range. However, 
if you want travel records beyond 2000 I can certainly provide that just let me know if you have a specific date range you 
looking for. 
Since 
as two different name variations (with and without the space in her surname) you were 
provided two separate TECS travel records. After reviewing both records, they are accurate and include all her travel 
crossings recorded in CBP holdings. Attached is an excel spreadsheet that includes her full travel crossings in chronological 
order for you to cross reference with the TECS records provided. Hopefully it will make it easier to review her travel rather 
than going back and forth between the two PDFs. 
If you need any additional info (visa/passport applications, travel records, etc.) or have any questions please don't hesitate 
to reach out!

Dear Judge Nathan, 
I hope this email finds you and your staff doing well. 
On June 30, 2021, the Government filed a letter directed at me, and this Court ordered that I respond by 
today. I have not entered an appearance in this proceeding and am not a member of the Southern District 
of New York, so I do not have filing privileges. Accordingly, I am emailing this responsive letter to 
Chambers and respectfully request that it be filed on the public docket. 
If the Court prefers that I have it filed it in a different fashion, please let me know. 
I am, of course, also copying government counsel and defense counsel. 
Have a nice weekend,

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 315 Filed 07/30/21 Page 1 of 3 
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
United States of America, 
—v—
Ghislaine Maxwell, 
Defendant. 
USDC SDNY 
DOCUMENT 
ELECTRONICALLY FILED 
DOC 0: 
DATE FILED:?/30/21 
20-CR-330 (AJN) 
ORDER 
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
The Government has moved for an order requiring David Markus to comply with Local 
Criminal Rule 23.1 following an op-ed that he authored opining on the merits of this pending 
case. Dkt. No. 309. 
Mr. Markus is plainly a lawyer associated with the defense in this case. His formal 
representation has involved handling at least one pre-trial issue for Ms. Maxwell—in particular, 
appeals to the Second Circuit of this Court's bail-denial determinations. Dkt. No. 173; see also 
United States v. Maxwell, Nos. 21-58-cr(L), 21-770-cr (2d Cir.). Beyond that, he has held 
himself out as Ms. Maxwell's attorney in press related to the current trial stage, including in the 
op-ed at issue in the Government's letter application, which describes him as "Maxwell's 
appellate counsel." He has also attended a proceeding in this matter and spoken on Ms. 
Maxwell's behalf to the press afterwards while identified as Ms. Maxwell's attorney. See 
Stephen Rex Brown, Ghislaine Maxwell Makes First In-Person NYC Court Appearance, N.Y. 
Daily News (Apr. 23, 2021), https://www.nydailynews.corn/new-yorkrny-ghislaine-maxwell-
arraignment-20210423-b3aza5eh7bddna7r247px2yb7e-story.html. 
Nevertheless Mr. Markus argues that he is not subject to Rule 23.1 because he does not 
currently represent Ms. Maxwell in any proceedings and has not made an appearance in this 
EFTA00018028
--- PAGE 2 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 315 Filed 07/30/21 Page 2 of 3 
Court. Dkt. No. 314. Rule 23.1 is not so superficial nor easily circumvented. Nothing in the 
rule limits its application to lawyers who have formally noticed an appearance. To the contrary, 
as the text throughout the rule makes clear, it applies to statements made by lawyers (and others) 
"associated" with "pending or imminent criminal litigation." S.D.N.Y. Local Criminal Rule 
23.1(a) (last updated Oct. 29, 2018); see also Rule 23.1(b) ("a lawyer participating in or 
associated with the investigation"); Rule 23.1(c) ("lawyer or law firm associated with the 
prosecution or defense"). An attorney need not be of record in order to be sufficiently 
"associated" with a case as to justify application of disciplinary rules regarding extrajudicial 
statements. Lawyers who have not filed a formal notice of appearance may still possess 
information that lends a perception by the public that their remarks on a pending case hold 
greater authority. See In re Hinds, 449 A.2d 483, 496 (N.J. 1982); see also People v. Buttajuoco, 
599 N.Y.S.2d 419 (Nassau Cty. Ct. 1993). 
Such is the case with Mr. Markus's role in the pending matter. As noted, Mr. Markus has 
attended a proceeding in this Court, after which he spoke to the press on Ms. Maxwell's behalf. 
He has represented Ms. Maxwell on appeals of this Court's pre-trial bail determinations. 
Moreover, Mr. Markus has identified himself as Ms. Maxwell's appellate lawyer in a published 
op-ed discussing his opinion of the merits of this case. These facts mean that the public, which 
includes potential jurors, may perceive Mr. Markus as an authoritative source of information 
regarding the pending matter and may readily consider his remarks to be accurate and reliable. 
Mr. Markus is therefore ORDERED to comply with Local Criminal Rule 23.1. 
The Government does not ask the Court to discipline Mr. Markus based on his op-ed and 
the Court declines to consider whether it violated Rule 23.1 given the potential lack of clarity 
with respect to whether Mr. Markus was bound by the rule. The Court emphasizes that the rule 
EFTA00018029
--- PAGE 3 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 315 Filed 07/30/21 Page 3 of 3 
provides illustrative examples of statements that "presumptively involve a substantial likelihood 
that their public dissemination will interfere with a fair trial or otherwise prejudice the due 
administration of justice within the meaning of the rule." S.D.N.Y. Local Criminal Rule 23(d). 
Going forward, Mr. Markus and all lawyers associated with the pending case are now 
clearly on notice that their conduct falls under the purview of Local Criminal Rule 23.1. Indeed, 
the above concerns do not apply only to Mr. Markus. This Court has previously noted that 
"counsel[,] agents for the parties and counsel for potential witnesses" must take care to "protect 
the Defendant's right to a fair trial by an impartial jury." Dkt. No. 28. This Court is cognizant 
that criminal matters heading toward trial are especially sensitive to extrajudicial statements. All 
those associated with this case must act to ensure the case is tried solely in court or else they risk 
being deemed responsible for any trial delay or for undermining the integrity of the upcoming 
trial. See S.D.N.Y. Local Criminal Rule 23.1(h). In addition to the impact it could have on this 
matter, failure to comply could also result in attorney discipline. Id. Rule 23.1(i). 
SO ORDERED.

New York, New York

As we start thinking about scheduling a next meeting with

could please let us know if there are any particular weeks that would not work for you or your client

Joe, 
We just wanted to check in very briefly—we had been hopeful that we'd be able to circle back with you earlier, 
but our investigation is currently still ongoing, so at the very least we wanted to let you know that we continue 
to appreciate both your client's prior assistance and her willingness to assist in the future. Nothing in our 
investigation since we were last substantively in touch has changed our view of your client, and we hope to be 
able to be in touch with you in the coming weeks with an update. In the interim, we do continue to view her 
status as we've previously conveyed, and please let us know if any issues arise on your end. 
thank you, 
From:

Hope the storm missed you this week, and that you and your client are doing okay.

Hi 
I just wanted to follow up re the August 14th meeting. Is it possible to schedule for early afternoon 
(anytime after 1)? I have proactive cooperation ongoing in another case involving multiple 
jurisdictions, and they are looking to meet the morning of 8/14. I understand if your schedule is 
already set, and will work around it.

As we start thinking about scheduling a next meeting with

could please let us know if there are any particular weeks that would not work for you or your 
client for a meeting in Florida (in particular, we don't want to interfere with anyone's summer

would be helpful to get a sense of your schedules, for planning purposes.

Yes, I think this document accurately describes the materials we've received, with just a note that it doesn't appear to 
include revocations, so to the extent those are intended to be shared, I think that word may need to be added.

— I've updated the sharing order application to be one to share the additional trust and will documents we have now 
received. Would you take a look when you can?

I've tried to describe the various materials we have gotten from the estate attorneys over the last two weeks. 
Would you mind taking a look (or asking a paralegal to take a look) to make sure I've accurately described/characterized 
the new stuff we're looking to share?

Just got the following update from 
(which I have conveyed ta: 
• Within the last approximately 48 hours, MDC staff has conducted temperature checks in Ms. Maxwell's cell, all of 
which revealed that the temperature in Ms. Maxwell's cell was between 71 and 74 degrees. MDC legal counsel 
noted that the target temperature for the MDC during this season is 68 degrees. MDC staff also gave Ms. Maxwell 
an extra blanket, so she now has three blankets in her isolation cell. 
• MDC staff physically entered Ms. Maxwell's cell and did not observe any smell or moisture. The unit team leader 
physically felt the papers in Ms. Maxwell's cell and observed that they felt normal and in no way damaged by 
moisture. 
• MDC staff will ensure that Ms. Maxwell is able to bring a cup and a snack with her into her isolation cell.

Good afternoon-

There are many conditions and restrictions placed upon her at the MDC

Ms. Maxwell's isolation cell.

The combination of cold, moisture, and sewage stench have made confinement 
in her cell unhealthy, unbearable, and utterly unreasonable. 
Her request for an extra blanket has been denied. 
Her request for use of her day mug for water has been denied. 
(She's been told to cup her hands to drink water from the faucet.) 
Her request to keep a snack in her cell has been denied. 
The moisture accumulating in her cell risks her health and the security 
of her legal work. 
You have known me and my reputation among your colleagues and the court. 
Trust me when I way that in my 35 years of federal criminal practice, having represented 
individuals charged and convicted of terrorism and capital murder, housed in 
MCC's 10South and FCI Florence-ADMAX (facilities I have visited), I have never witnessed 
such inappropriate and outlandish treatment of a non-violent pretrial detainee held on risk of flight. 
The mistreatment of Ghislaine Maxwell reflects negatively on your Office, the Court, 
and the BOP. The Government as a whole can and needs to do better. 
For today, we seek the bare minimum - a change of cell to a location that is safe 
from the cold, moisture, and stench, and an extra blanket to keep her warm. 
The rest will be left for another day. 
Please assist.

Enrique is generating NP reports for 1869 and 1884. 
W/r/t 1884, we are removing 169 PP emails, so there will be 1762 emails, and we are removing one PP chat (with 
Darren Indyke) so there will be 243 chats. 
W/r/t 1869, we are removing 93 PP emails, so there will be 1074 emails. 
I'll finish 1871 tomorrow.

Hi-
or 
correct me if they have a better way but I think the best way to generate the Responsive Report 
is to deselect (by removing the x in the column on the far left) all the data in the report and then go to the Tags view 
and select (by putting the x back in the column on the far left) all your tags. You then go up to the top left and choose 
the Report drop down and then choose Generate a New Report. Be sure to name it something that makes it clear that 
it is the Responsive report and you can also choose whether to create a UFDR report or a PDF. 
I'll give you an update on the other reports shortly.

I've finished the responsiveness review of the four reports that Reggie generated last week. I've tagged all of the 
responsive items in each report. What should my next step be to generate reports that only include the tagged items? 
Now that these are done, 
and I are all just waiting on the release of the remaining portions of 1872 and 
1869, as well as any content from 1B71, 1883, and 1884. As soon as you can release even just some of those reports, 
we will dive into the responsiveness review. 
To give you a sense of timing: In order to give our paralegals enough time to prepare the responsive materials for 
production in time for our 11/9 deadline, we need to finish the responsiveness review by no later than Thursday 11/5. 
So the sooner we can get anything over the wall for us to review, the better.

should not have chats and 1B69 should not have chats and should only have 1074 emails. And as always please stop 
your review and let me know if you come across anything else that you think may be privileged. Thanks!

- I've updated the sharing order application to be one to share the additional trust and will documents we have now 
received. Would you take a look when you can? 
-
I've tried to describe the various materials we have gotten from the estate attorneys over the last two weeks. 
Would you mind taking a look (or asking a paralegal to take a look) to make sure I've accurately described/characterized 
the new stuff we're looking to share? 
Thanks,

Hi everyone, 
I've attached a summary/analysis of the Epstein trust documents we received. This document incorporates the analysis of 
the trusts from 2019 I did previously. 
On the bottom, you'll see each trust has a tab and then further amendments to the trust (if any) go chronologically to the 
right. There's also key and summary tabs at the beginning of the document. 
Please let me know if you have any questions, or if you'd like me to walk you through how to use the document, in case it 
isn't clear. 
Thanks, 
p.s. I wouldn't recommend printing the document, just due to the size of the excel tables.

We've only received the additional material today; it is voluminous which means we won't be in a position 
for any meaningful conversation tomorrow. I suspect not before Friday either. Can we pencil in 3-4 pm on 
Friday and will confirm on Thursday ?

Mark — Hope you had a good weekend and just wanted to circle back on this. Realizing it is starting to get a bit late in the 
day in London, would tomorrow morning (New York time) work for a follow up call on this? Perhaps around 10am our 
time/3pm in London? If so, we can circulate another dial in. 
Thanks,

Hi 
I have spoken to Mark's business support and he is available at 4.15pm (UK time) today (ie in just 
under an hour's time). It is quite urgent so if we could speak then it would be greatly appreciated. 
If that does work please let us know what number to call you on?

Hi Mark - Thanks for reaching out. We do have an active investigation and would be happy to talk. As you likely know, 
today is a holiday in the US. Is this something we could discuss on Monday or is it more urgent than that? Thanks,

Hi—
Can you let me know, urgently, whether anyone in your office is handling the investigation into 
Jeffery Epstein, especially anything in relation to JP Morgan (he was a client of their private wealth 
division) and, if so, who, as we need to have a chat. If this is not in SDNY, do you know who is 
handling ongoing work into Mr E's world ?

In most cases, we had the agents interview the inmates without counsel after doing a Hammad memo. I've attached a 
few examples. Where the inmate is a cooperator, we worked through the attorney. There were also two instances where 
an inmate was not a cooperator but we worked through the attorney because of the nature of the defendant (both were 
EDNY death eligible inmates).

I'm working on a Rikers investigation, and 
suggested I check with you to ask: for the MCC case, were you ever 
present for an uncounseled inmate interview, or did you guys just have agents do those interviews? He wasn't sure what 
the practice was. Thanks.

Discussion: 
We are currently investigating the circumstances surrounding the August 10, 2019 suicide of Jeffrey Epstein while in the 
custody of the Bureau of Prisons ("BOP") at the Metropolitan Correctional Center ("MCC"). In particular, we are 
investigating MCC staff's (i) decision not to reassign a cellmate to Epstein on August 9, 2019, contrary to regular BOP 
practice and direct orders from the Warden; (ii) the failure of correctional officers assigned to the Special Housing Unit 
("SHU") at which Epstein was housed the night of August 9, 2019, to perform the required overnight counts and 30-
minute checks; and (iii) the falsification of records related to those count slips and 30-minute checks, in violation of Title 
18, United States Code, Section 1519. 
We are also investigating any efforts, following Epstein's death, to obstruct justice by destroying relevant records at MCC. 
In particular, we learned today that all institutional count slips for dates prior to August 10, 2019, which we requested on 
August 12, 2019, are apparently "missing." Today, we received a tip from a guard at MCC that while the guard was 
stationed at the rear gate, inmate 
brought down bales of shredded paper on Thursday and Friday of last 
week (August 15 and 16), and reported that he had been asked to shred documents by the BOP after-action team 
(although it is not clear from the tip whether 
took part in any shredding) and that "they are shredding everything." 
We would like to interview 
regarding these events.

Discussion: 
We are currently investigating the circumstances surrounding the August 10, 2019 apparent suicide of Jeffrey Epstein 
while in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons ("BOP") at the Metropolitan Correctional Center ("MCC"). In particular, we 
are investigating MCC staff's (i) decision not to reassign a cellmate to Epstein on August 9, 2019, contrary to regular BOP 
practice and direct orders from the Warden; (ii) the failure of correctional officers assigned to the Special Housing Unit 
("SHU") at which Epstein was housed the night of August 9, 2019, to perform the required overnight counts and 30-
minute checks; and (iii) the falsification of records related to those count slips and 30-minute checks, in violation of Title 
18, United States Code, Section 1519. We would like to have agents interview three inmates who were housed in the 
same area of the SHU with Epstein on August 9 and 10, 2019, in order to discuss what they saw and heard that night, 
including whether officers performed any overnight checks, or said or did anything upon discovering Epstein in his cell. 
While we anticipate interviewing other cooperating witnesses who were in the SHU that night, no cooperating witness 
was housed in the same area of the SHU as Epstein. Thus, these three inmates would be the most likely to have overheard 
or seen something of relevance. While ten other inmates were housed in the same area as Epstein and these three 
inmates, we have conferred with the AUSAs assigned to those matters and do not believe that those inmates would be 
appropriate individuals to approach, given their pending charges. 
Each of the three inmates is considered a potential witness in our investigation, and each is also currently being 
prosecuted by our Office in connection with other crimes. Investigating agents will seek to interview the inmates at MCC, 
will advise them of their Miranda rights prior to speaking with them, and will direct them not to discuss their ongoing 
criminal case. None of the investigating agents have had any involvement in the investigations of the conduct for which 
these individuals have already been charged, and they will make that clear to the inmates before trying to interview them. 
Nor do we intend to ask any of the inmates about why they are in the SHU or about facts which may implicate them in 
misconduct while housed at the MCC. Instead, our questioning will be narrowly focused on the general behavior of the 
guards while the inmates have been housed in the SHU (including whether checks are or are not regularly done) and, 
more specifically, the events on the night of August 9-10. We believe that the inmates may be more likely to cooperate 
and be forthcoming in this setting, rather than going through their attorneys. An overview of each of the inmates is set 
forth below.

and 
to 
whom the case is assigned, and they have no objection to us proceeding in this manner. 
The proposed contact is permissible under Hammad because the inmates are not represented in connection with their 
status as potential witnesses to the events of August 9 and 10, 2019. Moreover, agents will be instructed to advise the 
inmates of their Miranda rights, make clear they are not part of the investigation that gave rise to the inmates' pending 
charges, not ask any questions about their open criminal cases, and direct the inmates not to speak about their open 
criminal cases. Additionally, while there is no question that the Sixth Amendment, including its right to counsel, ordinarily 
applies at the point of indictment, none of these defendants have been indicted for the conduct about which we propose 
to question them. Nor, as noted, do we intend to question them about anything that might require them to implicate 
themselves in misconduct while being housed as a result of the crimes for which they have previously been charged. 
Accordingly, we believe the proposed contact is permissible.

Can you let me know, urgently, whether anyone in your office is handling the investigation into 
Jeffery Epstein, especially anything in relation to JP Morgan (he was a client of their private wealth 
division) and, if so, who, as we need to have a chat. If this is not in SDNY, do you know who is 
handling ongoing work into Mr E's world ?

Nude Photos of Underage Girls Seized From Jeffrey 
Epstein Mansion 
The prosecutors are seeking to detain the financier while he awaits trial on sexual trafficking charges, saying he 
is a flight risk.

 1-800-CALL FBI 
July 8, 2019 
Investigators seized nude photographs of underage girls from the Manhattan townhouse of Jeffrey Epstein 
as part of a new investigation into allegations he exploited dozens of minors for sex, prosecutors revealed 
on Monday. 
That detail was mentioned by federal prosecutors on Monday as they unsealed an indictment charging Mr. 
Epstein with sex trafficking and made an appeal to other women who may have been abused by him to 
come forward. 
"They deserve their day in court and we are proud to stand up for them by bringing this indictment," the 
United States attorney in Manhattan, Geoffrey S. Berman, said. 
Mr. Epstein, 66, is accused of engaging in sex acts with dozens of vulnerable minors, some as young as 14, 
during naked massage sessions, then paying them hundreds of dollars in cash. He also asked some of the 
EFTA00018155
--- PAGE 2 ---
girls to recruit other underage girls, the indictment said. 
"In this way, Epstein created a vast network of underage victims for him to sexually exploit in locations 
including New York and Palm Beach," the indictment said. 
Mr. Berman's decision to seek an indictment in Manhattan was an implicit rebuke to the decision by 
prosecutors in Miami in 2008 to enter an agreement with Mr. Epstein that allowed him to avoid federal 
prosecution and a possible life sentence. 
Under that deal, Mr. Epstein pleaded guilty to state prostitution charges and spent about a year in a Palm 
Beach jail. He was permitted to leave the facility six days a week to work. 
Mr. Berman made it clear his office was not bound by the agreement, which was overseen by Alexander 
Acosta, then the United States attorney in Miami who is now President Trump's secretary of labor. 
"That agreement, by its terms, only binds the Southern District of Florida," Mr. Berman said. 
The agreement has been examined in a series of reports in The Miami Herald and is being challenged in 
court. A federal judge ruled earlier this year Mr. Epstein's accusers should have been consulted about the 
deal before it was signed. 
The indictment unsealed in Manhattan on Monday said that from 2002 to 2005 Mr. Epstein and his 
employees engaged in a sex trafficking scheme, bringing underage girls to his Upper East Side mansion 
and his palatial compound in Palm Beach, Fla., to engage in sex acts with him. 
The indictment said Mr. Epstein used employees and assistants to arrange sexual rendezvous with at least 
one girl at his New York residence and two at his home in Palm Beach. 
Mr. Epstein is accused of having the girls perform nude massages, at which point he would masturbate and 
touch their genitals with his hands or with sex toys. 
The girls were paid hundreds of dollars in cash for each encounter and, once recruited, were asked to 
return to the mansion several times, where they were abused again, the indictment said. Mr. Epstein, the 
court documents read, "created a similar network of minor girls to victimize" in Florida. 
"This conduct, as alleged, went on for years and involved dozens of young girls, some as young as 14," 
Mr. Berman said. "The alleged behavior shocks the conscience." 
[Read the indictment.] 
The charges unsealed Monday by the Southern District of New York signal a prosecution that some of his 
accusers have been awaiting for years. 
Accusations of pedophilia and sexual predation have dogged Mr. Epstein for decades. And now, in the 
#MeToo era, his case has been held up as a prime example of insulated, powerful men avoiding 
accountability. 
For more than a decade, Mr. Epstein, a hedge fund manager, avoided a lengthy prison sentence, largely 
because of the agreement his lawyers struck with federal prosecutors in 2008. 
Mr. Epstein's social circle is filled with other high-profile connections, including to former President Bill Clinton, Prince 
Andrew of Britain and a host of others. 
In 2002, Mr. Trump described Mr. Epstein as "a terrific guy." 
"He's a lot of fun to be with," Mr. Trump told New York Magazine. "It is even said that he likes beautiful 
women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side." 
EFTA00018156
--- PAGE 3 ---
On Saturday, F.B.I. agents and New York Police Department officers used a crow bar to force open the wooden doors of 
Mr. Epstein's East 71st Street mansion. 
The charges unsealed Monday mirror those that federal prosecutors had prepared in Miami against Mr. 
Epstein more than a decade ago. In 2005, law enforcement officials there investigated Mr. Epstein after the 
parents of one of his accusers reported an incident to the police. 
As first reported in The Miami Herald last year, prosecutors had prepared a 53-page indictment accusing 
Mr. Epstein of being a sexual predator. But those charges were shelved in 2008 after an eleventh-hour deal 
was reached between the United States attorney's office in Miami and Mr. Epstein's lawyers. 
The plea agreement granted Mr. Epstein immunity from federal prosecution and let him plead guilty to two 
prostitution charges in state court. Federal prosecutors arranged for the plea deal to be kept secret from Mr. 
Epstein's accusers until it was finalized in court. 
In April, a federal judge ruled that prosecutors had violated the law in offering the plea agreement without 
informing Mr. Epstein's accusers. The Justice Department also opened a probe into the incident in 
February.

Hey 
Here are the documents you requested in regards to my investigation into Mr. Epstein. 
On March 15, 2019 Mr. Epstein signed the Virgin Islands sex offender registry Notification of Duty to Report Travel (IML) 
form. 
EFTA00018159
--- PAGE 2 ---
On March 22, 2019 Mr. Epstein travelled to Vienna, Austria where he and three (3) female passengers went to coffee and 
it appears this travel was not reported. 
On April 25, 2019 Mr. Epstein travelled to Morocco and it appears this travel was not reported. 
Please note if this information is made public I strongly believe it may hamper our ability to confirm this information as 
the investigation is ongoing. Especially with his resources. 
Any questions, please contact me.

Hello, 
The vendor had to break up the production into seven parts. As of right now the vendor has finished parts 1— 3 and is 
about to start on the stamping of documents for part 4. The vendor has exported part one to the hard drive and is 
currently working on exporting part to two the hard drive right now. Part three just finished about 10 minutes ago and 
the export has not started yet. You can review the productions by going to the following searches:

to stand down and that all Epstein stuff needs to go to and through us. DANY could still try to go forward with

Jeffrey Epstein Offers Mansion and Jet as Bond to 
Avoid Jail Before Trial 
Prosecutors have argued that the financier, who is accused of abusing dozens of underage girls, posed "an 
extraordinary risk of flight."

By Benjamin Weiser 
July 11, 2019 
Jeffrey Epstein, the financier facing sex-trafficking charges in New York, has been described by 
prosecutors as a man of enormous wealth: He owns a $77 million mansion on the Upper East Side, a $12 
million estate in Palm Beach, Fla., a private island in the Caribbean and a private jet, they said. 
And on Thursday, Mr. Epstein, 66, asked a federal judge to allow him to use some of his wealth to stay out 
of jail while he awaits trial, filing a detailed bail proposal with the court. 
Mr. Epstein asked the court to release him on substantial bond and pledged to put up his palatial 
Manhattan townhouse and his private jet as collateral. He also proposed he be allowed to remain under 
house arrest in his Upper East Side house, and said he would agree to electronic monitoring of his 
location. He said he would surrender his passport and ground his jet. 
In addition, his lawyers proposed that Mr. Epstein would hire private round-the-clock security guards who 
would "virtually guarantee" that he would not flee his house and would show up for court. 
A handful of superrich defendants have sought and occasionally obtained, over sharp objections from the 
government, similar bail provisions that allow them to finance a kind of personal jail rather than being 
held in a government lockup. 
Such bail packages have prompted intense debate about their fairness. The judge in Mr. Epstein's case, 
Richard M. Berman, rejected a similar proposal in 2016 from a wealthy Turkish-Iranian gold trader in a 
money laundering case. 
At the time, Judge Berman wrote that the proposal was "unreasonable because it helps to foster inequity 
and unequal treatment in favor of a very small cohort of criminal defendants who are extremely wealthy." 
Prosecutors had said on Monday after the charges were announced that they would ask to have Mr. Epstein 
held in jail until his trial. They said in court that he posed "an extraordinary risk of flight and danger," and 
that he had "nearly infinite means" and "tremendous incentives to use those means to flee prosecution." 
Judge Berman of Federal District Court in Manhattan is scheduled to take up Mr. Epstein's bail proposal at 
a hearing on Monday. 
Mr. Epstein was arrested Saturday night aboard a private jet at Teterboro Airport after arriving from Paris. 
He has been detained at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, a high-security facility in Lower Manhattan 
where accused terrorists, mobsters and, most recently, the Mexican drug lord known as El Chapo, have 
awaited trial. 
If convicted, Mr. Epstein faces up to 45 years in prison on sex-trafficking and conspiracy charges. The 
indictment unsealed on Monday by Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States attorney in Manhattan, said that 
between 2002 and 2005, Mr. Epstein recruited dozens of underage girls to engage in sex acts with him, 
after which he paid them hundreds of dollars in cash. 
The indictment also accused Mr. Epstein of encouraging some of his victims to recruit other underage girls 
that he could then abuse, and paying his "victim-recruiters" hundreds of dollars for each girl that they 
brought to him. "In so doing, Epstein maintained a steady supply of new victims to exploit," the 
indictment said.

Trump Doesn't Know About Labor 
Thank (io,i

Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta on Wednesday publicly defended his role in overseeing the prosecution of 
Jeffrey Epstein.CreditCreditAnna Moneymaker/The New York Times 
So, did you enjoy the parade for the U.S. women's soccer team? People sure did seem happy. I believe this is 
partly because the players are terrific and partly because many Americans are desperate to think about something 
other than Donald Trump. 
And, good Lord, his crack team of cabinet members. On Wednesday, Secretary of Labor Alex Acosta tried to 
hold back the outrage that's been building since people learned that, as a federal prosecutor in South Florida, he 
had brokered a very lenient punishment for Jeffrey Epstein, a rich guy who liked to have sex with underage girls. 
Explanation: It was a good deal. You know how this administration feels about good deals. 
"The Palm Beach state attorney's office was ready to let Epstein walk free," Acosta said in his calm, sort of 
toneless voice. "Our prosecutors ... presented the ultimatum." Which was that Epstein, who had molested a 
parade of teenagers, some only 14, had to serve at least a little jail time. The punishment Acosta wrangled with 
his alleged best possible efforts involved 13 months in prison, during which Epstein was free to spend most days 
at his office as long as he slept overnight in the clink. 
The victims had no idea that might be the end of the story. The case is now in the hands of federal prosecutors in 
New York who are going after Epstein on other sex-trafficking charges. (You may have noticed that over the last 
few years virtually everything that happens in this country winds up in the hands of New York prosecutors.) 
Do you think Acosta ever asked himself whether he could have fought harder? Nah. The problem was the 
victims, who were too "scared and traumatized" to be good witnesses. Asked by reporters if he had any regrets, 
he just said that was "a very hard question." 
Have you heard anybody in the Trump administration apologize for anything? Well, there was the occasion the 
secretary of health and human services said he was sorry he spent $400,000 of our tax dollars to fly around in 
specially chartered planes. But that was a long time and a whole lot of bad behavior ago. 
About Jeffrey Epstein. He sounds like one of the worst people imaginable, so we are, of course, stunned to hear 
he used to be tight with our current chief executive. "Terrific guy," Trump said in an interview with New York 
magazine in 2002. "He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and 
many of them are on the younger side." 
The palship no longer exists. "I had a falling-out with him. I haven't spoken to him in 15 years. I was not a fan of 
his, that I can tell you," said the president, who appears to have erased the lot-of-fun-to-be-with period. 
Are you shocked by any of this? Hey, early in our acquaintanceship we learned Trump is a guy who bragged 
about being so important he could get away with grabbing women by their private parts. Who was put into office 
thanks to Russian manipulation of our election. Some days you just want to sigh and talk a lot about women's 
soccer. 
Ever since the Epstein scandal arose, Trump has been defending Acosta, stressing what an "excellent" job he's 
doing. After all, the president told reporters, "our economy is so good, our unemployment numbers are at record 
lows." You might have thought he was under the impression the secretary of labor had something to do with 
boosting the economy. As opposed to things like workplace safety and collecting job statistics. 
And oh, yeah, human trafficking. Very embarrassing that Acosta is one of the people who's supposed to protect 
underage women from being sold as sex slaves. 
Hmm. Before this week, what do you think Donald Trump thought the Department of Labor did? 
A) Something about delivering babies. 
B) Something about getting good people to, you know, mow the lawn and stuff. 
C) Something. 
The president is oblivious, but otherwise almost nobody likes the job Acosta's been doing. People who care 
about workers are naturally outraged that he's been trying to water down everything from mine safety regulations 
to the rules that prohibit restaurant managers from grabbing a piece of the waiters' tips.
Trump insiders, of course, feel undermining workers' rights is supposed to be Acosta's mission. And they 
complain he's been sort of inept at it. Mick Mulvaney, the Trump Acting Chief of Staff For Life, has been trying 
to take control. Recently, Acosta's chief of staff was pushed out for a lack of, um, leadership. Or, as one former 
administration official told Politico, "There are times when he goes completely loony." 
You've got to be appalled by Acosta's failure to stand up for vulnerable children being lured into serving as sex 
playthings for a man who truly does epitomize the concept of filthy rich. 
But are you upset that Trump is too much of an ethical beanbag to get rid of him? The sad truth is that we're 
really probably better off with cabinet members too inept to accomplish anything at all.

I can certainly send you the court order on the bail determination once it's issued. If you haven't gotten it from me by 
later next week, could you please just remind me? I don't want it to get lost in the avalanche of current stuff. 
Also just to note, we obviously have no position (or request, directive, hint, nod, or wink) whatsoever regarding his

The State Department has gotten several inquires regarding Epstein's passport. He currently has one valid 
passport and Consular Affairs (CA) would like to revoke it. 
I understand he will have a bail hearing on Monday. Would you be able to send me the court order (even if he is 
remanded) so CA can revoke to the book? I assume if he is released on bail there will be a travel restriction 
imposed/surrender of his passport.

FYI : The Domestic Agencies who supply the Staff to the rich and famous, cover up crimes in order to collect 
fee's and to continue doing business. 
They send Staff for interviews knowing fine well that the client is either violent, a drunk/ drug abuser, 
physically/ verbally abusive, or even YES, a pedophile. 
MANY very rich clients ask for "Pretty Staff' and often they are sexual harassed on a daily basis in return for 
monies 
favors, etc. 
For example 
"Do this for me, and your family in the Philippines will be able to buy that house" 
These very rich families have the Staff sign "Confidentiality Clauses" and then have their lawyers scare the hell 
out of any Staff Members who dares to answer back, criticize, or threaten to go to the Police or the Press, as the 
lawyers threaten the Staff with the "Confidentiality Papers" and say things like 
"You will NEVER work 
again, and we will take your house, or apt away from you with Court costs so shut up" 
Then the same lawyers hand checks to disgruntled, or abused Domestic Workers as a pay-off to shut up and to go 
away 
and the Domestic Agencies then are told to blacklist the individual. 
This is how 5th and Park Avenue operate 
and yes, even CPW and Tribeca 
THEN to top it off the Domestic Agencies then threaten the Staff and say 
"If you dare to go to the Police, or 
the Press, or even the US Attorneys Office, we will blacklist you and no Agency will ever work with you ever 
again" 
How do you think Epstein and so many others get away with abuse for so long 999999???
It is designed that way. All are scared to talk 
and all are threatened 
one way or another. 
The US Attorneys Office could expose this, and for sure the damn will burst wide open on the likes of Seinfeld, 
Kalikow, Black, Soros, and many many more,,,,,,,,, 
The Domestic Agencies are just as guilty as the Clients who are up to no good, as they are licensed and bonded, 
and should know better. 
They cover up for the Clients, and even work with the lawyers of the rich to defend the rich from any legal cases 
against them. 
The key to all the abuse by the rich and famous in NYC is for the Domestic Employee's to feel safe to walk into 
the US Attorney's Office any time and file a complaint. 
NOT the 19th Precinct who cover up for the rich,,,,,,,,,,,, as the rich are very cunning, and offer ex Detectives 
cushy jobs as Driver/ Security when they retire from the 19th 
EFTA00018180
--- PAGE 2 ---
No, the US Attorneys Office need to have an open door for employee's of the rich and famous, so that they can 
feel safe. 
The NYPD are hired by the rich, so there is a bias 
No US Attorney ever goes to work for a Celebrity as a Security/ Driver detail 
Allow Domestic Workers a safety net to walk into your office, regardless of "Confidentiality Clauses" and you 
will hear it all 
Trust me, it's not pretty. 
Epstein is NOT alone in NYC 
The abuse is all over 
From sexual to major tax evasion. Suitcases 
of cash taken onto private planes.... and more

We'd like to identify a records custodian who could testify, in the event that it would be necessary. 
We found the attached cover letter and certification from FedEx in 2008, in case they are helpful in finding the specific

Hi 
We'd like someone to sign an affidavit for now, but we'd also like to identify someone who could testify at trial if need be. 
The trial is for Ghislaine Maxwell, scheduled to start in New York in November. 
I've attached a proposed declaration, though if FedEx has its own standard format, that will likely work too. 
Thanks,

Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 17 (c), (d), (e), and (g) (Effective 12/1/08) 
(c) Producing Documents and Objects. 
(I) In General. A subpoena may order the witness to produce any books, papers, documents, data, or other objects the subpoena 
designates. The court may direct the witness to produce the designated items in court before trial or before they are to be offered in 
evidence. When the items arrive, the court may permit the parties and their attorneys to inspect all or part of them. 
(2) Quashing or Modifying the Subpoena. On motion made promptly, the court may quash or modify the subpoena if compliance 
would be unreasonable or oppressive. 
(3) Subpoena for Personal or Confidential Information About a Victim. After a complaint, indictment, or information is filed, a 
subpoena requiring the production of personal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only by court 
order. Before entering the order and unless there are exceptional circumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that 
the victim can move to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object. 
(d) Service. A marshal, a deputy marshal, or any nonparty who is at least 18 years old may serve a subpoena. The server must deliver a copy 
of the subpoena to the witness and must tender to the witness one day's witness-attendance fee and the legal mileage allowance. The server 
need not tender the attendance fee or mileage allowance when the United States, a federal officer, or a federal agency has requested the 
subpoena. 
(e) Place of Service. 
(I) In the United States. A subpoena requiring a witness to attend a hearing or trial may be served at any place within the United 
States. 
(2) In a Foreign Country. If the witness is in a foreign country, 28 U.S.C. § 1783 governs the subpoena's service. 
(g) Contempt. The court (other than a magistrate judge) may hold in contempt a witness who, without adequate excuse, disobeys a subpoena 
issued by a federal court in that district. A magistrate judge may hold in contempt a witness who, without adequate excuse, disobeys a 
subpoena issued by that magistrate judge as provided in 28 U.S.C. § 636(e).

Independent 
Epstein Victims' Compensation Program 
PROTOCOL 
May 29, 2020 
I. 
PURPOSE AND OVERVIEW 
The Epstein Victims' Compensation Program (the "Program") is a voluntary, independent Program that 
has been established to compensate and resolve the claims of victims-survivors of sexual abuse by 
Jeffrey Epstein ("Epstein"). 
The Estate of Jeffrey Epstein (the "Estate") has retained the services of nationally recognized claims 
administration experts Kenneth R. Feinberg, Camille S. Biros and Jordana H. Feldman to design the 
Program. Ms. Feldman will also serve as the Administrator of the Program (the "Administrator"). This 
Protocol reflects input from victims-survivors, their lawyers, other potentially interested parties, and 
representatives of the Estate. 
Through the Program, the Estate wishes to acknowledge the wrongs endured by victims-survivors and 
offer them an opportunity to voluntarily resolve their individual claims for such sexual abuse. 
The Program is governed by the following non-exclusive guiding principles: 
• The Program is purely voluntary. It does not affect any rights a Claimant may have 
unless and until the Claimant accepts the offered compensation and executes a 
Release. 
A Claimant may reject the offer of compensation and may stop 
participating in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time prior to execution 
of the Release. 
• 
The Program is independent and will in no way be administered, controlled or 
overseen by the Estate. The Administrator is responsible for all decisions relating to 
the review, processing and evaluation of individual claims submitted to the 
Program. The Administrator will have final, binding and exclusive authority to 
determine Claimant eligibility and the valuation of each eligible individual claim. 
Decisions of the Administrator made pursuant to this Protocol are not subject to 
review or modification in any way by the Estate or any other party or entity. 
• 
There is no cap or limitation on the aggregate amount of funds available to 
compensate all eligible Claimants or on the amount of compensation to be made to 
each individual Claimant. Each individual claim will be evaluated separately by the 
Administrator. 
The Administrator will determine, in her sole and exclusive 
discretion, issues of eligibility and the amount of compensation and the Estate will 
pay all eligible claims based on the Administrators determination. 
I I Page 
EFTA00018200
--- PAGE 9 ---
• 
All Claimants will be treated with respect, dignity and fairness without regard to 
race, color, sexual orientation, national origin, religion, gender or disability. To 
ensure claims will be adjudicated fairly, the Administrator will manage the process 
so that all Claimants can equally access the Program's claim process. Individuals 
with disabilities will be given the opportunity to effectively communicate their 
claims and to request special process accommodations. 
The Program is available to all victims-survivors regardless of where they were harmed, when they were 
harmed, whether the claim is time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations, and whether they 
have previously filed a lawsuit against or settled with Epstein and/or the Estate. 
The exclusive claims period for filing a claim pursuant to this Protocol shall commence on the to-be-
determined Effective Date and shall conclude nine (9) months after that date ("Filing Deadline"). All 
individual claims filed with the Program must be filed within this period. 
To complement the Program's resources, the Administrator will, at her discretion and with the consent 
of the Claimant, consult with Professor Marci A. Hamilton, a nationally recognized sexual abuse expert, 
leading legal academic and advocate of victims' rights. Ms. Hamilton's role will be to further inform the 
Administrator and her staff about the dynamics of sexual abuse, common responses to sexual abuse, 
and the impact of sexual abuse on victims; to serve as a resource for the Administrator in developing or 
updating policies and procedures; to advise the Administrator regarding sensitivities involved in 
interactions with victims; and to serve as a referral source for the Administrator in providing post-
determination information to claimants who seek guidance, counseling or other services. 
The 
Administrator may, at her discretion and with the Claimant's prior written consent, request that Ms. 
Hamilton review an individual claimant file. The Administrator will determine on a case-by-case basis, in 
her discretion, the need to anonymize individual claimants' files before sharing them with Ms. Hamilton. 
As set forth above, the Administrator is solely responsible for all decisions relating to the administration 
of the Program, including the review, processing, evaluation, and determination of individual claims 
submitted to the Program. 
During the term of the Program, Ms. Hamilton will not meet or speak with a Claimant or her 
representatives concerning any aspect of the Program without the Administrator present. Ms. Hamilton 
will maintain in strict confidence and will not disclose outside the Program any information she obtains 
through her participation in the Program, including individual Claimants' submissions.

II. 
ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS 
A. Eligibility Criteria 
The persons eligible to participate in this Program are individuals who allege they were sexually abused 
by Epstein. In addition, the following criteria apply: 
• 
The claim of sexual abuse must be directed against Epstein. 
• 
An individual whose claim is time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations may 
participate in the Program provided that other eligibility criteria are met. 
• An individual who previously entered into a settlement agreement resolving a claim of sexual 
abuse against Epstein may participate in the Program provided that other eligibility criteria are 
met. 
• 
An individual who allegedly assisted Epstein in procuring other victims-survivors may 
participate in the Program where there is a credible basis to determine that the individual 
acted under duress as a result of her own sexual abuse by Epstein, provided that other 
eligibility criteria are met. 
• 
If the Claimant chooses to accept the offered compensation, the Claimant must dismiss with 
prejudice any existing lawsuits, legal actions or claims filed against the Estate or related entities 
and/or related individuals. The Claimant must provide proof of such dismissal along with or 
prior to the signed acceptance of the compensation determination offer letter and executed 
Release in order to receive payment. 
B. Legal Representatives of Claimants 
An individual may file a claim on a victim's behalf where that individual has been granted legal authority 
to act in a representative capacity pursuant to appropriate law. The "Legal Representative" of an 
individual Claimant shall mean: (1) in the case of a Claimant who is currently a minor, a parent or legal 
guardian authorized by law to serve as the minor's legal representative; (2) in the case of an 
incompetent or legally incapacitated Claimant, a person who has been duly appointed as the Claimant's 
legal representative in accordance with applicable law; (3) in the case of a deceased Claimant, a person 
who has been duly appointed to act as the personal representative of the Claimant's estate by a court of 
competent jurisdiction and is authorized to file and compromise a claim; or (4) an attorney authorized to 
represent the Claimant for purposes of pursuing a claim through this Program. 
Legal Representatives must provide proper documentation demonstrating representative capacity. Such 
proof may include a power of attorney; documentation showing the individual's appointment as 
guardian or guardian ad litem; documentation showing the individual's appointment as personal 
representative of the Claimant's estate (such as letters of administration); a copy of a retainer 
Wage 
EFTA00018202
--- PAGE 11 ---
agreement showing legal representation signed by both the Claimant and the attorney or a signed 
statement by an adult Claimant and the attorney that a licensed/admitted attorney is acting on her 
behalf. 
III. 
CLAIMS ADMINISTRATION - SUBMISSION, EVALUATION AND DETERMINATION 
A. Claims Submission Process 
Individuals who have filed a lawsuit, legal action or claim against Epstein and/or the Estate or have 
otherwise been identified as a victim of Epstein by their attorney to the Administrator on or before the 
Effective Date will be sent a Claim Form and other relevant Program information, including Instructions 
for completion and submission of the Claim Form and a copy of this Protocol. Individuals who have filed 
a lawsuit need not agree to a stay of litigation or make any other concession in any pending litigation to 
be eligible to participate in the Program. Likewise, individuals who have not yet filed a lawsuit remain 
free to file a lawsuit and engage in litigation concurrently with participation in the Program. Individuals 
must, however, dismiss with prejudice any and all existing lawsuits, legal actions and claims prior to or at 
the time of acceptance of a compensation determination offer in order to receive payment. 
Individuals who have not filed a lawsuit, legal action or claim against Epstein and/or the Estate or have 
not otherwise been identified as a victim of Epstein by their attorney to the Administrator on or before 
the Effective Date may register to participate in this Program on the Program's website at 
www.EpsteinVCP.com. To register, such individuals must complete a questionnaire setting forth their 
name, contact information, a summary description of the nature of the claim and other requested 
information. Upon registration, the Administrator will perform a preliminary review to consider if the 
individual is eligible to participate in the Program. If the Administrator deems that the individual is 
eligible to participate in the Program, she will then send that individual a Claim Form and other relevant 
Program information. 
Note: The fact that an individual is sent a Claim Form and other relevant Program information indicates 
that the Administrator has determined that such individual is eligible to participate in the Program. It 
does not indicate that the Administrator has determined that such individual is eligible to receive 
compensation. That determination is made only after a Claim Form and all required documentation has 
been submitted and evaluated by the Administrator. 
Registrations for individuals who have not filed a lawsuit, legal action or claim against Epstein and/or the 
Estate or have not otherwise been identified as a victim of Jeffrey Epstein by their attorney to the 
Administrator on or before the Effective Date will be accepted by the Administrator from the Effective 
Date through a date that is 45 days prior to the Filing Deadline ("Registration Deadline"). It is important 
to note that the Registration Deadline is separate from, and precedes, the Filing Deadline. As explained 
above, all claims must be filed by the Filing Deadline. 
4IPage 
EFTA00018203
--- PAGE 12 ---
All Claim Forms must be completed to the best of a Claimant's ability and filed no later than the Filing 
Deadline. Claim Forms should be uploaded to the Program website at www.EpsteinVCP.com, or mailed 
via overnight courier (a pre-paid courier voucher will be included with each packet) to the Administrator 
at the following address: 
Epstein Victims' Compensation Program 
Attn: Jordana H. Feldman, Administrator 
Claimants are invited to provide documentation identified in the Claim Form, and any other 
corroborating or supporting information sufficient to substantiate the claim, satisfy eligibility 
requirements, and allow the Administrator to review, process and evaluate the claim. If the claim is 
being presented by a Legal Representative, then the Legal Representative will be responsible for 
submitting the necessary documentation relating to the represented Claimant. 
Additional documentation may be requested at the discretion of the Administrator. Both the Claimant 
and the Estate will be afforded the opportunity to submit to the Administrator any information deemed 
relevant to the Administrator's evaluation and determination of the claim before the Administrator's 
final disposition of the claim. 
If a Claimant submits an incomplete or deficient claim, the Administrator will notify the Claimant, 
explain the additional information that is needed, and work with the Claimant or the Claimant's Legal 
Representative (where applicable) to assist in submitting a complete claim. 
B. Claims Evaluation and Determination 
Claims will be evaluated in the order in which they are received, with the Administrator evaluating each 
submitted individual claim in a prompt and fair manner. Claims will only be determined once all 
required documentation has been submitted to the Administrator, with due consideration granted to 
Claimant's good faith explanations for delays and/or absence of documentation. 
1. Factors Considered in Evaluating Claims 
As to each individual claim, the Administrator will determine, in her sole discretion based upon all of the 
information available, whether the allegations of sexual abuse are credible. The Administrator will 
consider appropriate factors and corroborative support, including but not limited to: 
• The level of documentation, corroboration or other circumstantial evidence regarding the 
nature and extent of the abuse, the frequency, location and other details of the abuse, and the 
age of the victim at the time of the abuse. Non-exhaustive examples of such evidence include

(ii) contemporaneous written notification or other correspondence (e.g., letters, emails) of the 
abuse by the Claimant to law enforcement authorities, parents, friends or others.

Administrator acknowledges that some Claimants may not be able to provide any 
documentation to corroborate their Claim based on the nature and circumstances of Epstein's 
conduct. If a Claimant's written and oral presentation is deemed to be credible by the 
Administrator, the Claimant may still be eligible for compensation under the Program. 
• 
Whether there exists any information and/or pertinent findings offered by the appropriate 
Office of the District Attorney, United States Attorney's Office, or other law enforcement 
agency. 
• 
Whether the Administrator finds the claims of the individual to be credible after complete 
review of all relevant documentation and other evidence provided by the Claimant and the 
Estate. 
As to each individual claim, the Administrator will determine, in her sole discretion based upon all of the 
information available, the amount of compensation that should be offered to each eligible Claimant. 
The Administrator will consider appropriate factors and corroborative support, including but not limited 
to: 
• The nature, duration and extent of the sexual abuse suffered by the Claimant. 
• 
The age of the Claimant at the time of the sexual abuse. 
• 
The nature and extent of the Claimant's physical or psychological damage resulting from the 
sexual abuse, and the effect of the sexual abuse on the Claimant. 
• 
The credibility of the claim based upon all of the facts and circumstances, supporting 
documentation and corroborating evidence. 
• Whether the Claimant previously entered into a settlement agreement with Epstein and 
received a payment pursuant to such agreement. 
The Administrator will confidentially send the Claimant a compensation determination offer letter 
including the following: (1) the Administrator's eligibility decision regarding the claim; (2) the amount of 
compensation offered; (3) a Release to be signed by the Claimant if the Claimant accepts the offered 
compensation; and (4) a Payment Option Form. The Administrator's offer shall be valid for 60 days from 
the date of the compensation determination offer letter. 
The Administrators determinations in this Program will not be binding on any potential criminal 
investigation involving Claimant's claims. 
2. Opportunities to be Heard 
The Claimant will be afforded an opportunity to be heard, either before or after the Administrator 
renders her determination. Upon request by the Claimant, the Administrator will be available to meet in 
person (as practicable in light of the COVID-19 pandemic), by video conference, or by teleconference to 
6IPage 
EFTA00018205
--- PAGE 14 ---
further discuss the claim. These meetings are completely optional and voluntary. Requests to meet 
with the Administrator should be sent by email to ClaimantServices@EosteinVCP.com and will be 
scheduled at a mutually convenient time and location. The Administrator may also request a meeting 
with a Claimant or her Legal Representative at a reasonable mutually convenient time and location, 
though the Claimant is not obligated to attend any such meeting. 
3. Release 
By submitting a claim to the Program, a Claimant is seeking to resolve all claims relating to allegations 
of sexual abuse against Epstein and/or the Estate, and related entities and individuals as set forth in the 
Release. If a Claimant chooses to accept the offer of compensation pursuant to the Program, the 
Claimant will be required to sign and execute a full Release, in a form satisfactory to the Estate, of all 
past and future claims (including Ifs pendens, writs of attachment, etc.) relating to such allegations of 
sexual abuse against the Estate, related entities and/or related individuals. A Claimant may reject the 
offer of compensation and may stop participating in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time 
prior to the execution of the Release. 
The Release will waive any rights the Claimant and her heirs, descendants, legatees or beneficiaries 
may have to assert any claims relating to allegations of sexual abuse against the Estate, related 
entities and/or related individuals, to file an individual legal action relating to such allegations, or to 
participate in any civil legal action associated with such allegations, except as a witness. However, 
the Release will not operate to preclude or limit the Claimant's ability to report and discuss 
allegations of sexual abuse with law enforcement officials or anyone else. In other words, the 
Release will not impose any rules of confidentiality on claimants, who are expressly permitted to 
discuss their allegations without restriction, should they choose. 
Before signing a Release, the Claimant must consult with an attorney selected by the Claimant. If the 
Claimant is not represented by an attorney, the Program will provide an attorney to provide free legal 
counseling to the Claimant for the sole purpose of advising the Claimant concerning the language and 
binding nature of the Release. 
No one affiliated with the Program will provide tax or legal advice to those receiving payments under 
the Program. Claimants are urged to consult with a tax advisor concerning any questions regarding 
tax liability for payments pursuant to the Program. 
4. Payments 
Upon the Claimant's acceptance of the Administrator's determination, the Administrator's receipt of 
the Claimant's executed Release and, where applicable, dismissal with prejudice of any existing 
lawsuit, legal actions or claims against the Estate or related entities and/or related individuals, the 
Administrator will initiate payment by check or electronic funds transfer to each eligible Claimant as 
directed by the Claimant. Checks will be sent to Claimants via overnight courier service. All 
Page 
EFTA00018206
--- PAGE 15 ---
payments made under the Program shall be for a Claimant's physical injuries, physical sickness and 
resulting emotional distress within the meaning of Section 104(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
C. Program Integrity 
For the purpose of protecting both the integrity of the Program and financial resources for eligible 
Claimants, the Administrator will institute all necessary measures to prevent payment of fraudulent 
claims, including taking steps to verify claims and analyze submissions for inconsistencies, 
irregularities or duplication. 
Each Claimant who signs the Claim Form at the time of submission certifies that the information 
provided in the Claim Form is true and accurate to the best of the Claimant's knowledge, and that the 
Claimant understands that false statements or claims made in connection with such submission may 
result in fines, imprisonment and/or any other remedy available by law. Claims that appear to be 
potentially fraudulent or to contain information known by the Claimant to be false when made will be 
forwarded to federal, state or local law enforcement agencies and/or the appropriate Office of the 
District Attorney and/or United States Attorney's Office for possible investigation and prosecution. 
D. Confidentiality/Privacy 
The Program is confidential.1 By filing a claim with the Program, the Claimant or her Legal 
Representative (where applicable) agrees that information submitted by the Claimant pursuant to 
the Program will be used and/or disclosed by the Administrator and her designees only for the 
following purposes: 
I) Processing and evaluating the Claimant's claim; 
2) Administering the Program and other Program-related work; and 
3) Reports to law enforcement where appropriate, related to potentially fraudulent claims. 
When documents or other information maintained or submitted by the Estate become part of a 
Claimant's file for purposes of the Program, such materials will be reviewed by the Administrator to 
assist in processing and evaluating the claim, but will otherwise remain confidential. No information 
provided by Claimants will be provided to the Estate except for the Claimant's name and the date(s) 
and location(s) of the alleged abuse, for the sole purpose of processing and evaluating the claim and, 
for purposes of the Release, the names of any other individual(s) to whom or by whom the Claimant 
alleges she was trafficked or sexually abused. The Estate has agreed that no information obtained 
solely through the Program will be disclosed publicly or used by the Estate in defending itself from any 
claim, regardless of forum. The Program's files are not available for inspection, review or copying by 
the Estate or the Claimant or her representatives during or after the Program, and all pertinent 
All parties agree that they are using the services of a third•party administrator to help reach a resolution of Individual claims 
of sexual abuse, and that this Program is entitled to confidentiality, privileges (mediation, settlement and all other pertinent 
privileges), and protection from disclosure under applicable law. 
8IPage 
EFTA00018207
--- PAGE 16 ---
mediation privileges, settlement privileges and other privileges apply. 
To protect the privacy of Claimants participating in the Program, all personal information provided by 
the Claimant during this process will be returned or destroyed within one year after the conclusion of 
the Program. 
Individual Claimants are not bound through the Program by any rules of confidentiality. Claimants may, 
at their sole and voluntary option, disclose information in their possession regarding their claim, their 
compensation and their experience with the Program. 
All confidentiality requirements are subject to law, regulation and judicial process. 
E. Reporting 
The Administrator shall, on a monthly basis, confidentially provide reports regarding the number and 
total value of claims paid each month to the Probate Court of the United States Virgin Islands and the 
Attorney General of the United States Virgin Islands. Such reports will report on an aggregate level 
only. No individual Claimant information will be published or disclosed in a way that compromises 
Claimant confidentiality.

Notice to those who use this form to request a subpoena 
Before requesting and serving a subpoena pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c), the party seeking the subpoena is advised to 
consult the rules of practice of the court in which the criminal proceeding is pending to determine whether any local rules 
or orders establish requirements in connection with the issuance of such a subpoena. If no local rules or orders govern 
practice under Rule 17(c), counsel should ask the assigned judge whether the court regulates practice under Rule 17(c) to 
1) require prior judicial approval for the issuance of the subpoena, either on notice or ex parte; 2) specify where the 
documents must be returned (e.g., to the court clerk, the chambers of the assigned judge, or counsel's office); and 3) 
require that counsel who receives produced documents provide them to opposing counsel absent a disclosure obligation 
under Fed. R. Crim. P. 16. 
Please note that Rule 17(c) (attached) provides that a subpoena for the production of certain information about a victim 
may not be issued unless first approved by separate court order.

subpoena requiring the production of personal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only by court 
order. Before entering the order and unless there are exceptional circumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that 
the victim can move to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object. 
(d) Service. A marshal, a deputy marshal, or any nonparty who is at least 18 years old may serve a subpoena. The server must deliver a copy 
of the subpoena to the witness and must tender to the witness one day's witness-attendance fee and the legal mileage allowance. The server 
need not tender the attendance fee or mileage allowance when the United States, a federal officer, or a federal agency has requested the 
subpoena. 
(e) Place of Service. 
(I) In the United States. A subpoena requiring a witness to attend a hearing or trial may be served at any place within the United 
States. 
(2) In a Foreign Country. If the witness is in a foreign country, 28 U.S.C. § 1783 governs the subpoena's service. 
(g) Contempt. The court (other than a magistrate judge) may hold in contempt a witness who, without adequate excuse, disobeys a subpoena 
issued by a federal court in that district. A magistrate judge may hold in contempt a witness who, without adequate excuse, disobeys a

U.S. Department of Justice

Southern District of New York 
The Silvio J. Mollo Building 
One Saint Andrew's Plaza 
New York. New York 10007 
April 5, 2021

The Honorable Alison J. Nathan 
United States District Judge 
Southern District of New York

New York, New York 10007 
Re: 
United Stases v. Chislaine Maxwell, S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
The Government respectfully submits this letter in connection with the Court's Order of 
March 24, 2021, regarding the defendant's application for an order authorizing a subpoena 
pursuant to Rule 17(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure for records from Boies Schiller 
Flexner LLP ("BSF"). For the reasons set forth herein, the Government respectfully requests that 
the Court (1) direct the defendant to provide the Government with a copy of the proposed subpoena 
to BSF and notice of all existing and future applications for subpoenas under Rule 17(c) returnable 
in advance of trial, and (2) direct that any productions made in response to Rule 17(c) subpoenas 
be produced to the opposing party and marked confidential under the protective order. 
I. 
Background 
As the Court is aware, the Government has produced to the defendant more than 2.7 million 
pages of discovery pursuant to the Government's various discovery obligations, including Rule 
16. The parties are also in discussions about the timing of further productions by the Government, 
including material provided pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3500 and Giglio material. 
EFTA00018236
--- PAGE 2 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 195 Filed 04/05/21 Page 2 of 11 
Page 2 
Those obligations, and not Rule 17 subpoenas, provide the avenue through which 
defendants in criminal cases obtain discovery. As the Supreme Court has explained, "[i]t was not 
intended by Rule 16 to give a limited right of discovery, and then by Rule 17 to give a right of 
discovery in the broadest terms." Bowman Dairy Co. v. United States, 341 U.S. 214, 220 (1951); 
see also United States v. Purin, 486 F.2d 1363, 1368 (2d Cir. 1973) ("A subpoena duces tecum in 
a criminal case is not intended as a means of discovery."). Unlike the rules of civil procedure—
permitting the issuance of subpoenas to seek production of documents or materials which, although 
themselves not admissible, may lead to admissible evidence—the criminal rules do not authorize 
the issuance of such broad pretrial subpoenas under Rule 17. See United States v. Cherry, 876 F. 
Supp. 547, 552 (S.D.N.Y. 1995); United States v. Gross, 24 F.R.D. 138, 141 (S.D.N.Y. 1959) 
(Rule 17(c) cannot be used "to obtain leads as to the existence of additional documentary evidence 
or to seek information relating to the defendant's case. This type of discovery, permissible under 
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, has not been authorized for criminal trials."). 
The purpose of Rule 17(c) is to "expedite the trial by providing a time and place before 
trial for the inspection of specific materials that the parties intend to offer into evidence. See 
United States v. Tagliaferro, No. 19 Cr. 472 (PAC), 2021 WL 980004, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 16, 
2021) (citing Bowman Data, Co., 341 U.S. at 220 (1951)); see also United States v. Ulbricht, 858 
F.3d 71, 109 (2d Cir. 2017) (explaining that the rule "allows parties to subpoena documents and 
objects to be introduced at criminal trials"), abrogated on other grounds as recognized by United 
States v. Chambers, 751 F. App'x 44, 46 & n.1 (2d Cir. 2018) (summary order). 
Accordingly, 
the Supreme Court has explained that, to require production of materials pursuant to Rule 17(c), 
the party seeking production must show that: 
(1) that the documents are evidentiary and relevant; (2) that they are 
not otherwise procurable reasonably in advance of trial by exercise 
EFTA00018237
--- PAGE 3 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 195 Filed 04/05/21 Page 3 of 11 
Page 3 
of due diligence; (3) that the party cannot properly prepare for trial 
without such production and inspection in advance of trial and that 
the failure to obtain such inspection may tend unreasonably to delay 
the trial; and (4) that the application is made in good faith and is not 
intended as a general "fishing expedition." 
United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 699-700 (1974) (footnote omitted); see United States v. 
Skelos, 988 F.3d 645, 661 (2d Cir. 2021) (affirming a decision to quash subpoenas through 
application of Nixon); United States v. Pena, No. 15 Cr. 551 (AIN), 2016 WL 8735699, at *1-*2 
(S.D.N.Y. Feb. 12, 2016) (applying Nixon, rather than the "more liberal standard" of United States 
v. Tucker, 249 F.R.D. 58 (S.D.N.Y. 2008), to the propriety of a Rule 17(c) subpoena). 
The Nixon test is demanding. The defendant must establish that the defense's "application 
is made in good faith and is not intended as a general `fishing expedition.' Nixon, 418 U.S. at 
700; United States v. Yian, No. 94 Cr. 719 (DLC), 1995 WL 614563, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 19, 
1995) (quashing subpoena that "call[s] for the production of the entire investigative file and is 
accurately described as a fishing expedition"); United States v. Cuthbertson, 630 F.2d 139, 144 
(3d Cir. 1980) ("[T]est for enforcement is whether the subpoena constitutes a good faith effort to 
obtain ident
ed evidence rather than a general `fishing expedition' that attempts to use the rule as 
a discovery device." (emphasis added)). Indeed, because the Rule poses such a risk of abuse and 
misuse, courts are stringent in holding those seeking to obtain documents to Rule 17(c) to their 
burden of demonstrating that the documents sought are (1) relevant, (2) admissible, (3) specifically 
identified, and (4) not otherwise procurable, and it is "insufficient" for a party to show only that 
the subpoenaed documents "are potentially relevant or may be admissible," United States v. RW 
Prof! Leasing Servs. Corp., 228 F.R.D. 158, 162 (E.D.N.Y 2005) (emphasis added). "[A] mere 
hope that the documents, if produced, may contain evidence favorable to the defendant's case will 
not suffice. Rule 17(c) requires a showing that the materials sought are currently admissible in 
EFTA00018238
--- PAGE 4 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 195 Filed 04/05/21 Page 4 of 11 
Page 4 
evidence; it cannot be used as a device to gain understanding or explanation." United States v. 
Rich, No. 83 Cr. 579 (SWK), 1984 WL 845, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 7, 1984) (internal quotation 
marks omitted) (emphasis added). Accordingly, subpoenas that call for "any" and "all" records 
"do not evince specificity" and "read[] like a discovery request, which is not permitted under Rule 
17(c)." Tagliaferro, 2021 WL 980004 at *3; see Pena, 2016 WL 8735699, at *3. And "[g]enerally 
the need for evidence to impeach witnesses is insufficient to require its production in advance of 
trial." Nixon, 418 U.S. at 701 (citations omitted); see Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(h) ("No party may 
subpoena a statement of a witness or of a prospective witness under this rule."). 
If a subpoena calls for "personal or confidential information about a victim," the subpoena 
may be served "only by court order" following "notice to the victim so that the victim can move 
to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object." Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(3). After a subpoena 
issues, "[t]he court may direct the witness to produce the designated items in court before trial or 
before they are to be offered in evidence." Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(1). "When the items arrive, the 
court may permit the parties and their attorneys to inspect all or part of them." Id. 
II. 
The Court Should Direct the Defendant to Provide Notice of Prior and Future 
Applications Under Rule 17(c) to the Government 
The Government has legitimate and cognizable interests in Rule 17(c) subpoenas issued by 
the defense. In particular, courts have routinely found that the Government has standing to move 
to quash Rule 17(c) subpoenas that target information about anticipated Government witnesses 
"based on the Government's 'interest in preventing any undue lengthening of the trial, any undue 
harassment of the witness and his family, and any prejudicial over-emphasis on the witness's 
credibility."' United States v. Ray, -- F.R.D. --, No. 20 Cr. 110 (LJL), 2020 WL 6939677, at *7 
(S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2020) (alterations omitted) (quoting United States v. Giampa, No. 92 Cr. 437 
(PKL), 1992 WL 296440, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 7, 1992)); see United States v. Becgstein, No. 16

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 195 Filed 04/05/21 Page 5 of 11 
Page 5 
Cr. 746 (PKC), 2017 WL 6887596, at *2-*3 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 28, 2017) ("Preventing the undue 
harassment of a cooperating witness is a legitimate governmental interest giving rise to standing 
in this context."); cf. United States v. Nachamie, 91 F. Supp. 2d 552, 558-60 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) 
(concluding that the Government failed to establish a legitimate interest where, among other 
things, none of the subpoenaed entities had been "publicly identified by the Government as trial 
witnesses, or as particularly vulnerable witnesses"). That is particularly true where the subpoena 
at issue seeks material that the defendants would be entitled to, if at all, as Giglio or 3500 material 
given that the Government has a cognizable interest in "controlling the timing of disclosures as 
to" witnesses who are expected to testify at trial, and for whom the Government has various 
disclosure obligations. United States v. Cole, No. 19 Cr. 869 (ER), 2021 WL 912425, at *2 
(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 10, 2021); see Bergstein, 2017 WL 6887596, at *3. Finally, the Government has 
standing to challenge subpoenas that call for its own communications. See United States v. Carton, 
Cr. 680 (CM), 2018 WL 5818107, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 19, 2018) (quashing a subpoena for 
communications with the Government).' 
The only way for the Government to vindicate those interests is with notice so that the 
Government may, as appropriate, have an opportunity to quash the subpoenas. There is no avenue, 
after a subpoena is issued and fulfilled, for the Government to protect its interests in the timing of 
disclosures about victims or the disclosure of the Government's own communications. That is 
particularly important given that a subpoena recipient may lack sufficient knowledge about the 
' The Government also has standing to challenge a Rule 17(c) subpoena at the request of a victim, 
witness or third-party impacted by the subpoena. See Ray, 2020 WL 6939677, at *7 ("Courts have 
acknowledged that the Government has standing to challenge Rule 17(c) subpoenas directed to a 
non-party when the non-party authorizes the Government to assert his or her right by request or by 
indicating its joinder in a motion to quash." (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted)).

case or motivation to move to quash an otherwise improper subpoena. 2 Accordingly, the 
Government respectfully requests notice of all subpoenas with pretrial return dates issued or sought 
to be issued under Rule 17(c).3
While, as the Court noted in its Order, Rule 17(c) subpoenas are frequently issued ex parte 
in this district, the issue is rarely litigated. See, e.g., United States v. States v. Wey, 252 F. Supp. 3d 
237, 243 (S.D.N.Y. 2017) (noting, without extended discussion, that subpoena had issued upon ex 
parte application); United States v. Earl; No. 03 Cr.0364 (NRB), 2004 WL 350725, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. 
Feb. 25, 2004) (noting that the defendant may seek subpoenas ex parte). When courts have considered 
the issue, however, many have directed that the parties should give each other notice of Rule 17(c) 
subpoenas unless a party can justify proceeding ex parte. See United States v. Skelos, No. 15 Cr. 
317 (KMW), 2018 WL 2254538, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. May 17, 2018) (explaining that courts have 
permitted ex parte requests "where a reason existed for doing so," and requiring notice "[t]o further 
reduce the risk that trial will be delayed, unless a party has a compelling reason for proceeding ex 
parte with a subpoena request"), aff'd, 988 F.3d 645 (2d Cir. 2021); United States v. St. Lawrence, 
Cr. 259 (CS), Dkt. No. 66 at 6 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 22, 2016) (requiring motions for Rule 17(c) 
subpoenas and permitting ex parte applications "if the movant can articulate a reason why it should 
be"); United States v. Boyle, No. 08 Cr. 523 (CM), 2009 WL 484436, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 24, 
2009) (requiring noticed motions for Rule 17(c) subpoenas to "assur[e] that such subpoenas are 
not abused or used for impermissible discovery," and permitting ex parte applications "where a 
For example, a financial institution may lack sufficient knowledge about the case or motivation 
to expend the resources to move to quash what appears to be a routine subpoena that broadly seeks 
financial records for a Government cooperator or lay witness to be used for impeachment purposes, 
notwithstanding the fact that such a subpoena may run afoul of the Nixon standard. 
The Government is not seeking notice of subpoenas returnable at trial.

party can demonstrate" a basis (emphasis omitted)); United States v. Weisman, 01 Cr. 529 (BSJ), 
2002 WL 1467845, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. July 8, 2002) (similar); see also United States v. Fox, 275 F. 
Supp. 2d 1006, 1012 & n.7 (D. Neb. 2003) (surveying the caselaw and adopting the "majority 
view" that Rule 17(c) "does not ordinarily permit the use of ex parte applications by the 
government or the defense for subpoenas seeking pretrial production of documents unless the sole 
purpose of seeking the documents is for use at trial," and even then, only if "there is a good trial-
related reason" and generally requiring production in the presence of the opposing party); 2 Wright 
& Miller, Fed. Prac. & Procedure § 275 (4'h ed.) ("It has been held, however, that in limited 
circumstances, both the government and a defendant may make an ex parte application for a pre-
trial subpoena duces tecum" (emphasis added)). But see Ray, 2020 WL 6939677 at *8 ("Courts 
in this District have long followed the practice of permitting both the defense and the Government 
to submit ex parte applications for Rule 17(c) subpoenas."); United States v. Reyes, 162 F.R.D. 
468, 470 (S.D.N.Y. 1995) (permitting ex parte applications because a party must "detail its trial 
strategy or witness list in order to convince a court that the subpoena satisfies the Nixon 
standards"). Notice of Rule 17(c) subpoenas is similarly appropriate in this case to prevent abuse 
and address objections expediently. And such a requirement is consistent with the plain language 
of Rule 17: while Rule 17(b) expressly provides for an ex parte procedure for indigent defendants 
seeking to subpoena a witness for trial, it makes no such provision for an application for the 
production of documents and objects pursuant to Rule 17(c).4
In Ray, the Court concluded that Rule 17(c) is simply an extension of Rules 17(a) and (b)'s 
provisions of subpoenas to witnesses, which may issue without notice. See 2020 WL 6939677, at 
*8 (quoting United States v. Florack, 838 F. Supp. 77, 79 (W.D.N.Y. 1993)). However, Rule 17(c) 
subpoenas for records are quite unlike subpoenas for trial testimony: they can be made returnable 
before trial, and Rule 17(c)'s text provides that materials obtained pursuant to such a subpoena 
may be returnable to the Court, which may in turn "permit the parties and their attorneys to inspect 
all or part of them," and subjects the subpoenas to motions to quash. Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(1)-(2)

Page 8 
Moreover, as the information currently available to the Government about the BSF 
subpoena makes plain, the Government's concerns are well founded. Indeed, the defendant has 
already sought issuance of a subpoena that appears to directly implicate the Government's interests 
by expressly and improperly seeking broad categories of victim information and communications 
with the Government. While the Government has not seen the subpoena to BSF, it also appears 
that the subpoena constitutes a fishing expedition for potential impeachment material, which 
plainly runs afoul of the Nixon test. (Letter from BSF to the Court at 2, Dkt. No. 191).5 Insofar 
as the defendant is attempting to engage in such an improper expedition in this case—or even if 
the defendant is merely pushing the limits of a Rule 17 subpoena—the Government respectfully 
submits that it should be afforded the opportunity to bring its concerns to the Court's attention. 
The Government recognizes that some information, such as portions of a defendant's 
explanation for why a particular request in a particular subpoena meets the Nixon standard, may 
reveal critical defense strategy meriting ex parte consideration by the Court. But the Government 
respectfully submits that interest can be served through specific defense requests tailored to the 
particular redaction or application at issue, rather than a default whereby the defendant is permitted 
to proceed entirely ex parte in seeking documents and materials pursuant to Rule 17(c). 
(emphasis added); see United States v. Reyes, 162 F.R.D. 468, 470 (S.D.N.Y. 1995) ("Rules 17(a) 
and 17(b), which govern the issuance of subpoenas returnable at trial, also do not provide guidance 
as to the proper procedure for obtaining a pretrial subpoena duces tecum."). These procedures are, 
at a bare minimum, in tension with proceeding azparte or under the rules that govern subpoenas 
for trial testimony. 
The Government has also not seen any response filing by the defendant, which per the Court's 
March 24, 2021 Order was to be filed on or before April 2, 2021. To the extent the defendant did 
file such a response, it was neither docketed nor provided to the Government, and as such, the 
Government is unable to address herein any arguments made by the defendant about the BSF 
subpoena.

III. 
Any Records Obtained Pursuant to a Rule 17(c) Subpoena Should Be Marked 
Confidential Under the Protective Order and Produced to the Opposing Party 
Additionally, and to the extent the defendant has issued or will issue other subpoenas a 
pane pursuant to Rule 17(c), the responsive records should be produced to the Government and 
marked confidential pursuant to the protective order. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(1). 
First, materials gathered pursuant to a Rule 17(c) subpoena by either party should be 
promptly made available to their adversary. As noted above, the text of Rule 17(c) plainly provides 
that materials obtained pursuant to a subpoena may be returned to the Court which "may permit 
the parties and their attorneys to inspect all or part of them." Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(1). Nowhere 
does the Rule provide for one party's ability to use a subpoena to secretively gather material in 
advance of trial, nor does it include a categorical exception due to concerns about defense or trial 
strategy. Indeed, because the purpose of Rule 17 is to obtain evidence for use at trial, and not to 
investigate for evidence or obtain impeachment material, disclosure of the fruits of a Rule 17(c) 
subpoena fits neatly with Rule 16's reciprocal obligations for disclosure of evidence that the 
defendant intends to introduce in her case-in-chief. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(b)(1)(A); United States 
v. St. Lawrence, 16 Cr. 259 (CS), Dkt. No. 66 at 6 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 22, 2016) ("It seems to the Court 
that because Rule 17(c) subpoenas are intended to obtain specific materials that the party expects 
to offer into evidence, Rule 16 would oblige the party to make the materials available to the other 
side anyway.").6
By contrast, to the extent the defendant has improperly obtained information through a 
Rule 17(c) subpoena, the Government should have the opportunity to move to preclude its use at 
trial. In order to permit such a motion to be made in a timely manner—and so as to avoid the 
To the extent the Government makes use of Rule 17(c) subpoenas, it similarly will promptly 
produce all material received to the defendant.

unnecessary delay and disruption that will occur if the Government only learns of the existence of 
such material during trial—the Government seeks disclosure of any records obtained in response 
to such a subpoena. At a minimum, the Court should order production of subpoena returns directly 
to the Court, so it may screen out irrelevant or improper information and determine whether any 
materials should be made available to the Government as well as the defendant. 
Second, the Court should direct that any material obtained pursuant to a Rule 17 subpoena 
be marked confidential and subject to the protective order. As noted above, the BSF subpoena 
appears to call for a substantial amount of sensitive personal information about victims. For 
instance, according to the letter from BSF, the subpoena to BSF requests the "original, complete 
copy" of a victim's diary. (Letter from BSF to the Court at 5, Dkt. No. 191). To the extent the 
defendant has obtained or will obtain sensitive information about victims or witnesses, it should 
be treated as "confidential" under the protective order much like other such information in this 
case.

Conclusion 
The Government respectfully requests that the Court order the defendant to provide notice 
to the Government of pending and future applications for Rule 17(c) subpoenas returnable in 
advance of trial, and for the Court to order that any records obtained in response to Rule 17(c) 
subpoenas be treated as confidential under the protective order and disclosed to the Government.

Good afternoon AUSAM, 
The FOLA media team advised they downloaded media from file number 31E-MM-108062, including audio and video. However, there seem to be some technical issues, 
as they are unable to listen to 48 audios located in the IA Vol 3. Per our Document Conversion Unit, this is a "codec problem," meaning there was probably some sort of 
user error from The AUSA's office when they exported the media to the disc. This issue cannot be resolved on our end. It would have to be addressed with whomever 
sent us the media. With this one exemption, the rest of the media we downloaded to OPWAN is viewable. Please see below a list with a brief description of the items.

Hi =, 
Thanks for your help with this. We spoke with 
at BOP legal this morning, and she highlighted three 
specific requirements for the laptop: 
• 
It must be disabled for all communications, including wifi/bluetooth 
• 
All games and entertainment programs must be disabled/uninstalled 
• 
All audio and video recording capabilities must be disabled 
is conferring with the Warden in the next few days to determine whether our laptop request will be approved. If 
the request is approved, we are aiming to deliver the laptop to MDC on November 16th, if at all possible. We would need 
time to load the laptop with files before it goes to MDC. 
Thanks so much,

It sure we will research one tonight and place the order tomorrow. It depends on availability and delivery. Do we have a 
copy of the data that goes with the drive? 
Also with the ever changing policies in BOP, can you confirm that they will allow her to have a laptop. Not sure the rules at 
MDC.

I hope you're doing well. Because of some discovery accessibility issues we're having in the Ghislaine Maxwell case, we 
would like to provide a clean laptop to Maxwell in MDC for discovery review purposes. The laptop need only permit 
review of standard files — word, pdf, .tif, .xls, etc. All other capabilities and programs can be disabled. I understand we 
did something similar in the Avenatti case, and we'd like to do the same here. Would that be possible? It would be a 
huge help to us if you could possibly prep and provide us with a laptop for this purpose. 
Thanks so much—

Hope you're doing well. As our team 
reviewing these materials in connection with discovery, we wanted to follow up 
with you about this project. In particular, we were hoping you could tell us how your office approached CDs that were in 
the boxes of materials from Florida. We noticed in the scans we received some documents that looked like the attached 
file — which looks like a photocopy of the CD. Were those materials downloaded by your office? If not, no worries at all, 
we have them from the primary file, but we wanted to check with you to make sure we had the complete set of 
materials you sent.

we last spoke, or if you were able to get all 29,000 to her? And we're also hoping to confirm for sure that all the

All, 
Attached is the most recent draft of the NPA brief. Apologies for the delay, I really struggled with this one. I think our 
arguments in the first half are strong, but I'm really not wild about the second half. Would very much appreciate your

Appeal from an order of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New 
York (Loretta A. Preska,Judge). 
UPON DUE CONSIDERATION WHEREOF, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, 
ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the order of the District Court be and hereby is 
AFFIRMED. 
Defendant-Appellant Ghislaine Maxwell appeals from a July 23, 2020 order unsealing certain 
litigation materials, including, and related to, Maxwell's April 2016 deposition transcript. She argues 
that the District Court abused its discretion in ordering the unsealing of the deposition materials. 
Specifically, she argues that there is a lower presumption of access to the deposition materials at 
issue in this case than to the summary judgment materials we ordered unsealed in Brown v. Atwavehc 
929 F.3d 41 (2d Cir. 2019), and that her interests outweigh the public's interests. We assume the 
parties' familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on 
appeal) 
When reviewing a district court's decision to seal a filing or maintain such a seal, "we 
examine the court's factual findings for clear error, its legal determinations de novo, and its ultimate 
decision to seal or unseal for abuse of discretion." Brown, 929 F.3d at 47 (citing Bernstein v. Bernstein 
Litowitt Berger dr Grossman LLP, 814 F.3d 132, 139 (2d Cir. 2016)). A district court abuses its 
discretion if it "(1) bases its decision on an error of law or uses the wrong legal standard; (2) bases its 
decision on a dearly erroneous factual finding; or (3) reaches a conclusion that, though not 
necessarily the product of a legal error or a clearly erroneous factual finding, cannot be located 
within the range of permissible decisions." Klipscb Grp. Inc. v. Epro E-Commerce Ltd, 880 F.3d 620, 
627 (2018) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
Although Michael Cemovich, DBA Cemovich Media, did not enter an appearance in this 
appeal, letters of his dated July 31, 2020 and September 9, 2020 are before the Court.

--- PAGE 3 ---
Case 20-2413. Document 140-1, 10/19/2020, 2955244, Page3 of 3 
We cannot conclude that the District Court abused its discretion in ordering the unsealing of 
the deposition materials. While "the presumption of public access in filings submitted in connection 
with discovery disputes or motions in Iimine is generally somewhat lower than the presumption 
applied to material introduced at trial, or in connection with dispositive motions such as motions for 
dismissal or summary judgment," the District Court correctly held that the deposition materials are 
judicial documents to which the presumption of public access attaches, and did not abuse its 
discretion in rejecting Maxwell's meritless arguments that her interests superseded the presumption 
of access. Brown, 929 F.3d at 50. The District Court's order articulated and applied the correct legal 
framework in its individualized review of the materials to be unsealed. 
CONCLUSION 
We have reviewed all of the arguments raised by Defendant-Appellant Maxwell on appeal 
and find them to be without merit We DENY the motion to consolidate this appeal with the 
pending appeal in United States a Maxwell, No. 20-3061-cr. For the foregoing reasons, we also 
AFFIRM the July 23, 2020 order of the District Court. 
In the interest of judicial economy, any further appeal in this civil case shall be referred to 
this panel. 
The mandate shall issue forthwith.

Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1079 Filed 07/29/20 Page 1 of 4 
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
VIRGINIA L. GIUFFRE, 
Plaintiff, 
-against-
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 
Defendant. 
No. 15 Civ. 7433 (LAP) 
MEMORANDUM & ORDER 
LORETTA A. PRESKA, Senior United States District Judge: 
The Court has reviewed Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell's letter 
requesting reconsideration of the Court's July 23, 2020, decision 
to unseal (1) the transcripts of Ms. Maxwell's and Doe l's 
depositions, and (2) court submissions excerpting from, quoting 
from, or summarizing the contents of the transcripts. (See dkt. 
no. 1078.) 
Ms. Maxwell's eleventh-hour request for reconsideration is 
denied. As Ms. Maxwell acknowledges in her letter, reconsideration 
is an "extraordinary remedy." In re Beacon Assocs. Litig., 818 F. 
Supp. 2d 697, 701 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (quoting In re Health Mgmt. Sys. 
Inc. Sec. Litig., 113 F. Supp. 2d 613, 614 (S.D.N.Y. 2000)). Such 
motions "are properly granted only if there is a showing of: (1) 
an intervening change in controlling law; (2) the availability of 
new evidence; or (3) a need to correct a clear error or prevent 
manifest injustice." Drapkin v. Mafco Consol. Grp., Inc., 818 F. 
Supp. 2d 678, 696 (S.D.N.Y. 2011). "A motion for reconsideration 
EFTA00018294
--- PAGE 2 ---
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1079 Filed 07/29/20 Page 2 of 4 
may not be used to advance new facts, issues or arguments not 
previously presented to the Court, nor may it be used as a vehicle 
for relitigating issues already decided by the Court." Bennett v. 
Watson Wyatt & Co., 156 F. Supp.2d 270, 271 (S.D.N.Y. 2001). 
Here, Ms. Maxwell's request for reconsideration hinges on her 
assertion that new developments, i.e., her indictment and arrest, 
provide compelling reasons for keeping the deposition transcripts 
sealed. 
(See dkt. no. 1078 at 5.) 
But, despite Ms. Maxwell's 
contention that she could not address the effect of those events 
in her objections because they occurred after the close of 
briefing, (id.), 1 this is plowed ground. Indeed, in her original 
objection to unsealing, Ms. Maxwell argued that the specter of 
ongoing 
criminal 
investigations 
into 
unknown 
individuals 
associated with Jeffrey Epstein--a group that, of course, includes 
Ms. Maxwell--loomed large over the Court-ordered unsealing 
The Court notes as a practical matter that Ms. Maxwell was 
arrested on July 2, 2020--that is, three weeks prior to the Court's 
July 23 decision to unseal the materials at issue. To the extent 
that they relate to the to the Court's balancing of interests in 
the unsealing process, the issues that Ms. Maxwell raises in her 
request were surely plain the day that Ms. Maxwell was apprehended. 
Ms. Maxwell, however, did not seek to supplement her objections to 
unsealing despite ample time to do so. In fact, the Court notified 
the parties on July 21, 2020, that it would announce the unsealing 
decision with respect to Ms. Maxwell's deposition, together with 
other documents, on July 23. (See dkt. no. 1076.) Even then, Ms. 
Maxwell made no request for delay or to supplement her papers. 
Ms. Maxwell did not raise her "vastly different position," 
(Transcript of July 23 Ruling at 16:2-3), until moments after the 
Court had made its decision to unseal the relevant documents. 
EFTA00018295
--- PAGE 3 ---
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1079 Filed 07/29/20 Page 3 of 4 
process. (See dkt. no. 1057 at 5.) This argument, specifically 
Ms. Maxwell's concern that unsealing would "inappropriately 
influence potential witnesses or alleged victims," (id.), and her 
reference 
to "publicly 
reported 
statements 
by 
Plaintiff, 
Plaintiff's counsel, the United States Attorney for the Southern 
District of New York, and the Attorney General for the U.S. Virgin 
Islands" about those investigations, (id.), carried with it the 
clear implication that Ms. Maxwell could find herself subject to 
investigation and, eventually, indictment. The Court understood 
that implication as applying to Ms. Maxwell and thus has already 
considered any role that criminal charges against Ms. Maxwell might 
play in rebutting the presumption of public access to the sealed 
materials. 
Ms. Maxwell's request for reconsideration of the 
Court's July 23 ruling is accordingly denied. 
Given the Court's denial of Ms. Maxwell's request for 
reconsideration, the Court will stay the unsealing of Ms. Maxwell's 
and Doe l's deposition transcripts and any sealed or redacted order 
or paper that quotes from or discloses information from those 
deposition transcripts for two business days, i.e., through 
Friday, July 31, 2020, so that Ms. Maxwell may seek relief from 
the Court of Appeals. Any sealed materials that do not quote from 
or disclose information from those deposition transcripts shall be 
unsealed on July 30, 2020, in the manner described by the Court's 
Order dated July 28, 2020. (See dkt. no. 1077.) Ms. Maxwell's and 
EFTA00018296
--- PAGE 4 ---
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1079 Filed 07/29/20 Page 4 of 4 
Doe l's deposition transcripts and any sealed materials that quote 
or disclose information from them shall be unsealed in the manner 
prescribed by the July 28 Order on Monday, August 3, 2020, subject 
to any further stay ordered by the Court of Appeals. 
SO ORDERED.

Honorable Alison J. Nathan 
United States District Judge 
United States Courthouse 
Foley Square 
New York, NY 10007 
Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell 
S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
Counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell renew our request that the Court release the names of 
potential jurors, for attorneys' eyes only, as soon as the written questionnaires are distributed. 
Based on the Court's statement during the October 21 teleconference, it was counsel's 
understanding that juror names would be provided to counsel on the Juror Sheet to be inserted in 
the questionnaire. In responding to the Court's order regarding approval of the video to be played 
to prospective jurors, the government importuned the Court to deny counsel the opportunity to 
properly vet jurors at this critical state of the proceeding. Not knowing the names of the 
potential jurors will prevent the parties from conducting necessary background research on the 
jurors in advance of voir dire so that they may evaluate potential challenges and strikes. Due to 
the large number of potential jurors (600), waiting until voir dire to release the names of the 
jurors will make it virtually impossible for the parties to conduct any meaningful research to 
uncover issues that may require follow-up questions, lead to additional cause challenges, or 
enable the parties to exercise their peremptory challenges in an informed manner. 
Recently, in Sines, et at v. Kessler, et at, 17-CV-72 (KNM) (W.D. Va.), the civil case 
brought against the organizers of the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, the United 
EFTA00018373

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 407 Filed 11/03/21 Page 2 of 7 
LAW OFFICES OF OOOBI C.STERNHEIM 
States District Court for the Western District of Virginia ordered a semi-anonymous jury (jurors 
were publicly referred to by number only) and released the names of all potential jurors to 
counsel, plus all pro se defendants (including Richard Spencer and Christopher Cantwell), who 
are allegedly prominent white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and the leaders of hate groups that 
planned, promoted, and executed the violent acts in Charlottesville. (See Exhibit A, annexed.) 
The defendants in Sines included factions of the Ku Klux Klan. The concerns for juror privacy in 
Sines dwarf any conceivable concerns in this case and Sines is also the subject of extensive 
ongoing publicity. We submit that withholding the names of 600 jurors until the day of jury 
selection will deprive Ms. Maxwell of her right to be tried by a fair and impartial jury and is a 
procedure that would violate due process in this particular case.' 
"An impartial jury is one in which all of its members, not just most of them, are free of 
interest and bias." United States v. Parse, 789 F.3d 83, 111 (2d Cir. 2015). In Parse, a case 
before Judge Pauley sub nom United States v. Daugerdas, a jury convicted defendant Parse and 
three of his co-defendants of numerous financial fraud and tax evasion charges. 789 F.3d at 86. 
After trial, all defendants moved pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 33(a) for a new trial on the ground 
that one of the jurors, Juror No. I (Catherine M. Conrad), "had lied and withheld material 
information during voir dire and was biased against defendants. Judge Pauley appointed Bobbi 
C. Sternheim, Esq. to represent the juror and conducted an evidentiary hearing in which the juror 
was examined, and in a detailed thorough opinion (see United States v. Daugerdas, 867 
F.Supp.2d 445 (S.D.N.Y.2012) found it "undisputed that Conrad lied extensively during voir dire 
and concealed important information about her background" (id. at 451), her level of education, 
place of residence, criminal history, and other matters. Parse, 789 F.33 at 87-90. 
' We are unaware of any other recent high-profile case in which a written juror questionnaire was 
used and the Court withheld the names of the jurors from counsel following the completion of 
the questionnaires.

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 407 Filed 11/03/21 Page 3 of 7 
LAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C.STERNHEIM 
Judge Pauley granted a motion for a new trial as to Parse's three co-defendants but held 
that Parse had waived his right to an impartial jury because his attorneys had sat on background 
research collected before and during trial that suggested Conrad's voir dire answers were false. 
Id. at 101. On appeal, the Second Circuit "had no difficulty with the ruling of the district court in 
the present case that the jury empaneled to hear the case against these defendants was not an 
impartial jury." Id. at III. Moreover, the Second Circuit reversed Judge Pauley's ruling that 
Parse had waived his right to an impartial jury, and vacated Parse's conviction. Id. at 118. 
The result in Parse was that a three-month trial, with 41 witnesses and some 1,300 
exhibits, was undone by the falsehoods of one juror during voir dire—falsehoods that could have 
been uncovered by thorough background research and prompt action by the parties. Numerous 
bar associations have recognized that trial counsel is expected to conduct intemet research on 
potential jurors. Some bar associations have opined that professional standards of competence 
and diligence may require such research. For example, just weeks after Judge Pauley conducted 
a post-conviction evidentiary hearing in Parse, the New York City Bar Association stated the 
following in Formal Opinion 2012-2: 
Just as the intemet and social media appear to facilitate juror misconduct, the same 
tools have expanded an attorney's ability to conduct research on potential and sifting 
jurors, and clients now often expect that attorneys will conduct such research. Indeed, 
standards of competence and diligence may require doing everything reasonably 
possible to learn about the jurors who will sit in judgment on a case. 
Similarly, in 2014, the American Bar Association recognized the "strong public interest 
in identifying jurors who might be tainted by improper bias or prejudice," and therefore opined 
that it was proper for counsel to research "a juror's or potential juror's Internet presence, which 
may include postings by the juror or potential juror in advance of and during a trial. . . ." See 
Standing Committee on Ethics and Professional Responsibility, Formal Op. 466 at 1-2, Am. Bar

Assn. (2014); see also New York State Bar Association, Dec. 8, 2015 Report of the Social Media 
Committee of the Commercial and Federal Litigation Section, at 15 ("[I]t is not only permissible 
for trial counsel to conduct Internet research on prospective jurors, but [] it may even be 
expected."). 
Other courts have acknowledged that using the intemet to conduct background research 
on prospective jurors is a "rudimentary practice" during jury selection. United States v. Stone, 
No. 19-0018 (ABJ), 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 67359, at *93 (D.D.C. Apr. 16, 2020); see also 
Carino v. Muenzen, No. A-5491-0811, 2010 N.J. Super. Unpub. LEXIS 2154, at *27 (Super. Ct. 
App. Div. Aug. 30, 2010) (trial judge erred in preventing counsel from using the intemet during 
jury selection). It is so routine that a party who fails to uncover disqualifying information about 
a potential juror, despite a reasonable opportunity to do so, risks waiving the right to use that 
information in post-conviction proceedings. Stone at *90 (denying motion to vacate conviction 
and for a new trial because, inter alia, "the defense could have discovered the [foreperson's 
social media] posts as early as September 12, 2019, the day counsel received access to the 
completed juror questionnaires, including the foreperson's, which had her name printed legibly 
on the signature page."). 
Having additional time to conduct background research on each of the venirepersons is 
the best way to ensure a fair and impartial jury. Balancing the need to protect juror privacy 
against Ms. Maxwell's right to a fair and impartial jury weighs in favor of releasing the names of 
potential jurors to counsel upon the completion of their written questionnaires, not at voir dire. 
Respectfully submitted,

CASE No. 3:17-cv-00072 
ORDER 
JUDGE NORMAN K. MOON 
Upon this Court's own motion, upon notice that Plaintiffs' counsel may seek to designate 
certain non-lawyers within their list of six (6) persons to be provided electronic access to the jury 
questionnaires, and otherwise finding good cause shown, the Court hereby AMENDS Pretrial 
Order1 3, (Dkt. 1172) as follows: 
Plaintiffs, and Defendants represented by counsel collectively, may each designate no 
more than six (6) persons, which may be comprised of (1) current counsel of record or (2) third 
parties working under their direction, who are formally engaged and supervised by the attorneys 
of record, and for whom such attorneys of record will be responsible, and who will have signed 
the Court's protective order, Dkt. 167, so long as such persons include at least one attorney 
admitted to practice in the Western District of Virginia, to be provided electronic access by the 
Clerk to receive and review copies of the jury questionnaires, on a rolling basis. A list including 
names and occupations of prospective jurors, and information matching such prospective jurors 
with the questionnaires pursuant to Dkt. 1204 1 2, will also be provided to such specifically 
designated persons by Plaintiffs and represented Defendants, no more than five (5) days before 
trial. Jury questionnaires and such occupation list, and any information contained therein, are

subject to the Court's orders regarding confidentiality in Dkt. 1172 and 1204, and shall not be 
disclosed to any other person without prior authorization of Court. 
Any pro se Defendant—upon completing a declaration stating, under penalty of perjury, 
they will not disclose the contents of such questionnaires or the jury occupation list provided to 
such pro se Defendant to any other person—may review the questionnaires and jury occupation 
list onsite in the Clerk's Office. A paper copy of the completed questionnaires and the jury 
occupation list customarily made available to pro se litigants will be maintained in the Clerk's 
Office. 
If any party requests specific access to the confidential juror questionnaires in excess of 
the provisions outlined above and in Dkts. 1172 and 1204, they shall file a motion to that effect. 
In all other respects, this Court's Orders of Dkt. 1172 and 1204 shall remain unchanged and in 
force. 
It is so ORDERED. 
The Clerk of the Court is directed to send a certified copy of this Order to the parties.

'Uncontrollable' Jeffrey Epstein: 5 Takeaways 
From Judge's Bail Decision 
By Ben Weiser 
Mr. Epstein was willing to pay almost anything to stay out of jail. But the judge suggested he 
could not curb his sexual fixation with minors. 
July 19, 2019 
[What you need to know to start the day: Get New 
York Today in your Mbar" 
A federal judge on Thursday denied Jeffrey 
Epstein's request for bail pending his trial on sex-
trafficking charges in Manhattan. As a result, Mr. 
Epstein, 66, a wealthy financier who owns a private 
jet, luxury homes around the world and a private 
island in the Caribbean, will have to spend months 
in a Manhattan jail that typically holds accused 
mobsters, drug dealers and terrorists. 
The judge, Richard M. Berman of Federal District 
Court, agreed with prosecutors that Mr. Epstein was 
not only a flight risk, but posed a threat to others —
particularly teenage girls - if released. 
The judge's strong rebuke of Mr. Epstein's conduct 
and request to be allowed house arrest stood in 
sharp contrast to how the authorities in Florida had 
treated the financier in 2007. 
f 
EFTA00018384
--- PAGE 2 ---
That year, he reached a widely criticized deal that 
let him avoid federal prosecution on charges he 
sexually abused and trafficked minors. Instead, he 
pleaded guilty to state charges of soliciting a minor 
for prostitution and ended up serving 13 months in 
jail. He was allowed to leave the facility six a days 
a week,  ostensibly to work. 
Here are five takeaways from Judge Berman's 
opinion. 
Mr. Epstein was willing to pay almost any price 
to stay out of jail 
Unlike so many people charged in state and federal 
courts, affording bail was not a problem for Mr. 
Epstein. He had offered to post a gargantuan bond, 
secured by his $56 million mansion on East 71st 
Street in Manhattan and his  private jet. 
"I am authorized to say to the court," one of Mr. 
Epstein's lawyers told Judge Berman, "that 
whatever bond you want Mr. Epstein to sign —
whether it's $100 million or an amount close to the 
amount of the assets that we have provided — Mr. 
Epstein is prepared to sign it." 
Mr. Epstein provided the court with a one-page 
summary of his assets that placed their value as of 
June 30 at $559 million. 
His lawyers said he would even pay for 24-hour 
private security to assure that he did not flee. The 
government argued he was seeking special 
treatment, a "gilded cage," as one prosecutor put it 
in court. 
EFTA00018385
--- PAGE 3 ---
The judge was concerned that if released, Mr. 
Epstein would again abuse teenage girls 
Judge Berman's decision portrayed Mr. Epstein as 
sex offender who could not be trusted to curb his 
sexual fixation with teenagers. He pointed to the 
nature of Mr. Epstein's alleged crimes and his 
propensity to commit them. 
"The crimes Mr. Epstein has been charged with are 
among the most heinous in the law principally, in 
the court's view, because they involve minor girls," 
the judge wrote. 
A federal indictment charged that between 2002 and 
2005, Mr. Epstein and his employees paid dozens of 
underage girls — at least one as young as 14 years 
old — to give him massages while nude or topless 
at his residences in Manhattan and Palm Beach, 
Fla. 
During the massages, he engaged in various sex 
acts with them, the indictment said. He also used 
some of the teenagers to recruit other girls to abuse, 
paying the "victim-recruiters" hundreds of dollars 
for each girl they brought to him, the indictment 
said. 
"Mr. Epstein's alleged excessive attraction to sexual 
conduct with or in the presence of minor girls —
which is said to include his soliciting and receiving 
massages from young girls and young women 
perhaps as many as four times a day — appears 
likely to be uncontrollable," Judge Berman wrote. 
"It seems fair to say that Mr. Epstein's future 
behavior will be consistent with past behavior," the 
judge added. 
EFTA00018386
--- PAGE 4 ---
His immense wealth, private planes, 
international travel and liquid cash made Mr. 
Epstein a flight risk 
Given Mr. Epstein's wealth, the risk of flight was 
"exceptionally high," the office of Geoffrey S. 
Berman, the United States attorney in Manhattan, 
told the judge in court papers. 
Besides his New York mansion, Mr. Epstein's asset 
summary listed multi-million-dollar properties in 
New Mexico; Palm Beach; Paris and the Caribbean. 
Prosecutors have said Mr. Epstein's primary 
residence is a private island in the United States 
Virgin Islands. 
Mr. Epstein's assets also included $56 million in 
cash and more than $300 million in securities and 
other financial instruments. Prosecutors also said 
his sex registration documentation (stemming from 
his 2008 guilty plea in Florida) listed no fewer than 
motor vehicles, including seven Chevrolet 
Suburbans, a cargo van, a Range Rover, a 
Mercedes-Benz sedan, a Cadillac Escalade and a 
Hummer. 
Then there was a safe that the authorities said they 
searched in Mr. Epstein's mansion in Manhattan, in 
which they found more than $70,000 in cash, 48 
loose diamonds ranging in size from approximately 
one to 2.38 carats, and a large diamond ring. 
The judge concluded that Mr. Epstein was "a 
serious risk of flight" and "no conditions can be set 
that will reasonably assure his appearance at trial." 
The contents of Mr. Epstein's safe gave the judge 
pause 
EFTA00018387
--- PAGE 5 ---
Inside that safe the authorities also found an 
Austrian  passport bearing Mr. Epstein's photograph 
but another person's name, the judge noted. The 
judge's opinion made it clear that prosecutors and 
Mr. Epstein's lawyers disagreed sharply over the 
passport's significance. 
Prosecutors said the passport showed Mr. Epstein 
knew how to obtain false travel documents or 
assume other identities. 
Defense lawyers told the judge that Mr. Epstein, 
whom they described as "an affluent member of the 
Jewish faith,"acquired the passport in the 1980s 
"when hijackings were prevalent," in connection 
with Middle East travel. The passport expired 32 
years ago, the defense wrote, and "was for personal 
protection in the event of travel to dangerous areas, 
only to be presented to potential kidnappers, 
hijackers or terrorists should violent episodes 
occur." 
In the back and forth, prosecutors noted that the 
passport included numerous stamps showing it was 
used to enter France, Spain, Britain and Saudi 
Arabia in the 1980s. The defense said Mr. Epstein 
was given the passport by a friend, the trips were 
not his and he had never used it. 
The passport was not the only unusual item found 
inside Mr. Epstein's mansion. The authorities said 
they found hundreds and perhaps thousands of 
sexually suggestive photographs of fully or partially 
nude females, including photos that appeared to be 
of underage girls. Some of the photos were 
discovered in the locked safe. 
The judge was concerned Mr. Epstein might try 
to intimidate or buy off witnesses 
EFTA00018388
--- PAGE 6 ---
Judge Berman also made it clear he thought Mr. 
Epstein might seek to silence witnesses against him 
if he were granted pretrial release. "Mr. Epstein's 
dangerousness is considerable and includes sex 
crimes with minor girls and tampering with 
potential witnesses," the judge wrote. 
The judge highlighted the government's argument 
that Mr. Epstein had tried to influence possible 
witnesses against him when he wired $350,000 late 
last year to two  people close to him, shortly after 
the Miami Herald started publishing an exposé 
about him. The Herald's series quoted his accusers, 
described how he had sexually abused teens for 
years, and laid out the lenient plea agreement he 
had negotiated with the United States attorney in 
Miami. 
The judge also cited evidence from prosecutors that 
Mr. Epstein or his representatives had harassed or 
intimidated witnesses in civil suits. 
For instance, he quoted a Palm Beach police report 
in 2006 about a threat made to one of Mr. Epstein's 
accusers. The report said the accuser had claimed 
that one of Mr. Epstein's associates had told her that 
those who helped Mr. Epstein "will be 
compensated" and those who hurt him "will be 
dealt with." In another case, a parent of one of Mr. 
Epstein's alleged victims had reported that Mr. 
Epstein's private investigator had driven the 
parent's car off the road. 
"A court may order detention if there is a serious 
risk that the defendant will attempt to threaten, 
injure or intimidate a prospective witness or juror," 
the judge noted.

according to a law enforcement official briefed on the incident

A week after being denied bail, Jeffrey E. Epstein was found unconscious in his cell on Tuesday at a 
federal jail in Manhattan with marks on his neck, and prison officials were treating the incident as a 
possible suicide attempt, a law enforcement official who had been briefed on the matter said. 
Mr. Epstein's injuries were not serious, said the official, who requested his 
name not be published because he was not authorized to speak on the matter. 
And of course there is the WNBC report...

https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/09/bill-barr-will-not-recuse-himself-in-jeffrey-epstein-prosecution.html 
Attorney General Bill Barr 
will not recuse himself from 
Jeffrey Epstein child sex 
prosecution 
PUBLISHED 10 MIN AGO 
Attorney General William Barr will not recuse himself from involvement in the new federal criminal 
prosecution of accused child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, an official said Tuesday. 
But Barr will recuse himself from an internal Justice Department probe of current Labor Secretary's 
Alex Acosta involvement in approving a controversial no-prosecution deal with the wealthy 
financier a decade ago, an official said. 
Barr's decision to have oversight over the Epstein prosecution came on the heels of reports that he 
had recused himself from the case, which is being prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the 
Southern District of New York. 
And it came as a bevy of Democratic members of Congress and presidential candidates demanded 
that Acosta resign because of his role as then-U.S. Attorney in Miami in signing off on a deal to not 
prosecute Epstein in the mid-2000s. 
Epstein, 66, is accused of sexually abusing dozens of underage girls from 2002 to 2005 after they 
were brought to his luxurious residences on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, and in Palm Beach, 
Fla. 
EFTA00018398
--- PAGE 2 ---
Epstein was being eyed for the same alleged conduct in Florida that federal prosecutors have now 
charged him with in Manhattan. 
A Justice Department official on Tuesday said that Barr consulted with career ethics officials at the 
department, and concluded he did not have to recuse himself from the current prosecution in 
Manhattan. 
However, Barr was quoted Monday as saying he was recusing himself from the Epstein case. 
"I'm recused from that matter because one of the law firms that represented Epstein long ago was a 
firm I subsequently joined for a period of time," Barr told reporters on Monday. 
Barr joined that law firm, Kirkland & Ellis, in 2009. 
Kirkland & Ellis had represented Epstein in 2008, when he was being investigated in Florida. 
Barr's comment Monday seems to have referred — or does so now — to his continued recusal from 
the Justice Department's internal probe into the non-prosecution of Epstein as signed off by Acosta. 
"Due to his prior association with Kirkland and Ellis, the Attorney General has and will remain 
recused from any retrospective review of the resolution of the earlier [Southern District of Florida] 
matter," the Justice Department official told CNBC on Tuesday.

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 17 Filed 07/08/20 Page 1 of 18 
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
x 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
SUPERSEDING INDICTMENT 
S1 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 
Defendant. 
x 
COUNT ONE 
(Conspiracy to Entice Minors to Travel to Engage in 
Illegal Sex Acts) 
The Grand Jury charges: 
OVERVIEW 
1. 
The charges set forth herein stem from the role 
of GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, in the sexual exploitation 
and abuse of multiple minor girls by Jeffrey Epstein. In 
particular, from at least in or about 1994, up to and including 
at least in or about 1997, MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and 
contributed to Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among 
other things, helping Epstein to recruit, groom, and ultimately 
abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age 
of 18. The victims were as young as 14 years old when they were 
groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
that certain victims were in fact under the age of 18. 
2. 
As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to 
abuse minor victims, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, and 
Jeffrey Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to 
EFTA00018407
--- PAGE 2 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 17 Filed 07/08/20 Page 2 of 18 
Epstein's residences in different states, which MAXWELL knew and 
intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to 
sexual abuse. Moreover, in an effort to conceal her crimes, 
MAXWELL repeatedly lied when questioned about her conduct, 
including in relation to some of the minor victims described 
herein, when providing testimony under oath in 2016. 
FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
3. 
During the time periods charged in this 
Indictment, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, had a personal and 
professional relationship with Jeffrey Epstein and was among his 
closest associates. In particular, between in or about 1994 and 
in or about 1997, MAXWELL was in an intimate relationship with 
Epstein and also was paid by Epstein to manage his various 
properties. Over the course of their relationship, MAXWELL and 
Epstein were photographed together on multiple occasions, 
including in the below image: 
EFTA00018408

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 17 Filed 07/08/20 Page 3 of 18 
4. 
Beginning in at least 1994, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 
the defendant, enticed and groomed multiple minor girls to 
engage in sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein, through a variety of 
means and methods, including but not limited to the following: 
a. 
MAXWELL first attempted to befriend some of 
Epstein's minor victims prior to their abuse, including by 
asking the victims about their lives, their schools, and their 
families. MAXWELL and Epstein would spend time building 
friendships with minor victims by, for example, taking minor 
victims to the movies or shopping. Some of these outings would 
involve MAXWELL and Epstein spending time together with a minor 
victim, while some would involve MAXWELL or Epstein spending 
time alone with a minor victim. 
b. 
Having developed a rapport with a victim, 
MAXWELL would try to normalize sexual abuse for a minor victim 
by, among other things, discussing sexual topics, undressing in 
front of the victim, being present when a minor victim was 
undressed, and/or being present for sex acts involving the minor 
victim and Epstein. 
c. 
MAXWELL'S presence during minor victims' 
interactions with Epstein, including interactions where the 
minor victim was undressed or that involved sex acts with 
Epstein, helped put the victims at ease because an adult woman . 
was present. For example, in some instances, MAXWELL would

--- PAGE 4 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 17 Filed 07/08/20 Page 4 of 18 
massage Epstein in front of a minor victim. In other instances, 
MAXWELL encouraged minor victims to provide massages to Epstein, 
including sexualized massages during which a minor victim would 
be fully or partially nude. Many of those massages resulted in 
Epstein sexually abusing the minor victims. 
d. 
In addition, Epstein offered to help some 
minor victims by paying for travel and/or educational 
opportunities, and MAXWELL encouraged certain victims to accept 
Epstein's assistance. As a result, victims were made to feel 
indebted and believed that MAXWELL and Epstein were trying to 
help them. 
e. 
Through this process, MAXWELL and Epstein 
enticed victims to engage in sexual activity with Epstein. In 
some instances, MAXWELL was present for and participated in the 
sexual abuse of minor victims. Some such incidents occurred in 
the context of massages, which developed into sexual encounters. 
5. 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, facilitated 
Jeffrey Epstein's access to minor victims knowing that he had a 
sexual preference for underage girls and that he intended to 
engage in sexual activity with those victims. Epstein's 
resulting abuse of minor victims included, among other things, 
touching a victim's breast, touching a victim's genitals, 
placing a sex toy such as a vibrator on a victim's genitals,

directing a victim to touch Epstein while he masturbated, and 
directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. 
MAXWELL AND EPSTEIN'S VICTIMS 
6. 
Between approximately in or about 1994 and in or 
about 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, facilitated 
Jeffrey Epstein's access to minor victims by, among other 
things, inducing and enticing, and aiding and abetting the 
inducement and enticement of, multiple minor victims. Victims 
were groomed and/or abused at multiple locations, including the 
following: 
a. 
A a multi-story private residence on the 
Upper East Side of Manhattan, New York owned by Epstein (the 
"New York Residence"), which is depicted in the following 
photograph:

folloKing photograph: 
c. 
A ranch in Santa Fe, New Mexico owned by

d. 
MAXWELL's personal residence in London, 
England. 
7. 
Among the victims induced or enticed by GHISLAINE 
MAXWELL, the defendant, were minor victims identified herein as 
Minor Victim-1, Minor Victim-2, and Minor Victim-3. In 
particular, and during time periods relevant to this Indictment, 
MAXWELL engaged in the following acts, among others, with 
respect to minor victims: 
a. 
MAXWELL met Minor Victim-1 when Minor 
Victim-I was approximately 14 years old. MAXWELL subsequently 
interacted with Minor Victim-1 on multiple occasions at 
Epstein's residences, knowing that Minor Victim-1 was under the 
age of 18 at the time. During these interactions, which took 
place between approximately 1994 and 1997, MAXWELL groomed Minor 
Victim-1 to engage in sexual acts with Epstein through multiple 
means. First, MAXWELL and Epstein attempted to befriend Minor 
Victim-1, taking her to the movies and on shopping trips. 
MAXWELL also asked Minor Victim-1 about school, her classes, her 
family, and other aspects of her life. MAXWELL then sought to 
normalize inappropriate and abusive conduct by, among other 
things, undressing in front of Minor Victim-1 and being present 
when Minor Victim-1 undressed in front of Epstein. Within the 
first year after MAXWELL and Epstein met Minor Victim-1, Epstein 
began sexually abusing Minor Victim-1. MAXWELL was present for 
EFTA00018413
--- PAGE 8 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 17 Filed 07/08/20 Page 8 of 18 
and involved in some of this abuse. In particular, MAXWELL 
involved Minor Victim-1 in group sexualized massages of Epstein. 
During those group sexualized massages, MAXWELL and/or Minor 
Victim-1 would engage in sex acts with Epstein. Epstein and 
MAXWELL both encouraged Minor Victim-1 to travel to Epstein's 
residences in both New York and Florida. As a result, Minor 
Victim-1 was sexually abused by Epstein in both New York and 
Florida. Minor Victim-1 was enticed to travel across state 
lines for the purpose of sexual encounters with Epstein, and 
MAXWELL was aware that Epstein engaged in sexual activity with 
Minor Victim-1 after Minor-Victim-1 traveled to Epstein's 
properties, including in the context of a sexualized massage. 
b. 
MAXWELL interacted with Minor Victim-2 on at 
least one occasion in or about 1996 at Epstein's residence in 
New Mexico when Minor Victim-2 was under the age of 18. Minor 
Victim-2 had flown into New Mexico from out of state at 
Epstein's invitation for the purpose of being groomed for and/or 
subjected to acts of sexual abuse. MAXWELL knew that Minor 
Victim-2 was under the age of 18 at the time. While in New 
Mexico, MAXWELL and Epstein took Minor Victim-2 to a movie and 
MAXWELL took Minor Victim-2 shopping. MAXWELL also discussed 
Minor Victim-2's school, classes, and family with Minor Victim-
2. In New Mexico, MAXWELL began her efforts to groom Minor 
Victim-2 for abuse by Epstein by, among other things, providing 
EFTA00018414
--- PAGE 9 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 17 Filed 07/08/20 Page 9 of 18 
an unsolicited massage to Minor Victim-2, during which Minor 
Victim-2 was topless. MAXWELL also encouraged Minor Victim-2 to 
massage Epstein. 
c. 
MAXWELL groomed and befriended Minor 
Victim-3 in London, England between approximately 1994 and 1995, 
including during a period of time in which MAXWELL knew that 
Minor Victim-3 was under the age of 18. Among other things, 
MAXWELL discussed Minor Victim-3's life and family with Minor 
Victim-3. MAXWELL introduced Minor Victim-3 to Epstein and 
arranged for multiple interactions between Minor Victim-3 and 
Epstein. During those interactions, MAXWELL encouraged Minor 
Victim-3 to massage Epstein, knowing that Epstein would engage 
in sex acts with Minor Victim-3 during those massages. Minor 
Victim-3 provided Epstein with the requested massages, and 
during those massages, Epstein sexually abused Minor Victim-3. 
MAXWELL was aware that Epstein engaged in sexual activity with 
Minor Victim-3 on multiple occasions, including at times when 
Minor Victim-3 was under the age of 18, including in the context 
of a sexualized massage. 
MAXWELL'S EFFORTS TO CONCEAL HER CONDUCT 
8. 
In or around 2016, in the context of a deposition 
as part of civil litigation, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, 
repeatedly provided false and perjurious statements, under oath, 
regarding, among other subjects, her role in facilitating the

ATTACHMENT A 
I. Premises to be Searched—Subject Premises 
1. 
The premises to be searched (the "Subject Premises") are described as a multi-story 
single-family residence located at 9 East 71st Street, New York, New York, and include all locked 
and closed containers found therein. A photograph of the front entrance to the Subject Premises 
is included below: 
IL Items to Be Seized 
A. Evidence, Fruits, and Instrumentalities of the Subject Offenses 
This warrant authorizes the seizure of certain evidence, fruits, and instrumentalities of 
violations of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1591 (sex trafficking of minors), and 371 (sex 
trafficking conspiracy) (the "Subject Offenses") described as follows: 
The items to be seized from the Subject Premises are any computer devices and storage 
media that may contain any electronically stored information falling within the categories set forth 
in Section B of this Attachment, including, but not limited to, desktop and laptop computers, disk 
drives, modems, thumb drives, personal digital assistants, smart phones, digital cameras, scanners, 
routers, modems, and network equipment used to connect to thd Internet. In lieu of seizing any 
such computer devices or storage media, this warrant also authorizes, in the alternative, the 
copying of such devices or media for later review. 
The items to be seized from the Subject Premises also include: 
2017.08.02 
EFTA00018427
--- PAGE 4 ---
1. 
Any items or records needed to access the data stored on any seized or copied 
computer devices or storage media, including but not limited to any physical keys, encryption 
devices, or records of login credentials, passwords, private encryption keys, or similar information. 
2. 
My items or records that may facilitate a forensic examination of the computer 
devices or storage media, including any hardware or software manuals or other information 
concerning the configuration of the seized or copied computer devices or storage media. 
3. 
Any evidence concerning the identities or locations of those persons with access to, 
control over, or ownership of the seized or copied computer devices or storage media. 
B. Search and Seizure of Electronically Stored Information 
As set forth in Section A to this attachment, this warrant authorizes the search of the Subject 
Premises for any computer devices and storage media that may contain any electronically stored 
information falling within the categories set forth below: 
4. 
Any documents or communications with or regarding victims or potential victims 
of the Subject Offenses; 
5. 
Any photographs of victims or potential victims of the Subject Offenses; 
6. 
My nude, partially nude, or sexually suggestive photographs of individuals who 
appear to be teenage girls, or younger; 
7. 
Records or other items that evidence ownership, control, or use of, or access to 
devices, storage media, and related electronic equipment used to access, transmit, or store 
information relating to the Subject Offenses, including, but not limited to, sales receipts, 
warranties, bills for Internet access, handwritten notes, registry entries, configuration files, saved 
usernames and passwords, user profiles, e-mail contacts, and photographs; 
8. 
My child erotica, defined as suggestive visual depictions of nude minors that do 
not constitute child pornography as defined by 18 U.S.C. § 2256(8). 
C. Review of ESI 
Law enforcement personnel (including, in addition to law enforcement officers and agents, 
and depending on the nature of the ESI and the status of the investigation and related proceedings, 
attorneys for the government, attorney support staff, agency personnel assisting the government in 
this investigation, and outside technical experts under government control) will create a forensic 
image of the Subject Devices (if practicable) and review the ESI contained therein for information 
responsive to the warrant, that is, for the materials specified in Section B of this Attachment. 
In conducting this review, law enforcement personnel may use various techniques to 
determine which files or other ESI contain evidence or fruits of the Subject Offenses. Such 
techniques may include, for example: 
2017.08.02 
EFTA00018428
--- PAGE 5 ---
• 
surveying directories or folders and the individual files they contain (analogous to 
looking at the outside of a file cabinet for the markings it contains and opening a drawer 
believed to contain pertinent files); 
• 
conducting a file-by-file review by "opening" or reading the first few "pages" of such 
files in order to determine their precise contents (analogous to performing a cursory 
examination of each document in a file cabinet to determine its relevance); 
• 
"scanning" storage areas to discover and possibly recover recently deleted data or 
deliberately hidden files; and 
• 
performing electronic keyword searches through all electronic storage areas to 
determine the existence and location of data potentially related to the subject matter of 
the investigation6; and 
• 
reviewing metadata, system information, configuration files, registry data, and any 
other information reflecting how, when, and by whom the computer was used. 
. 
Law enforcement personnel will make reasonable efforts to search only for files, 
documents, or other electronically stored information within the categories identified in Section 
ILA of this Attachment. However, law enforcement personnel are authorized to conduct a 
complete review of all the ESI from seized devices or storage media if necessary to evaluate its 
contents and to locate all data responsive to the warrant. 
Keyword searches alone are typically inadequate to detect all relevant data. For one thing, 
keyword searches work only for text data, yet many types of files, such as images and videos, do 
not store data as searchable text. Moreover, even as to text data, there may be information properly 
subject to seizure but that is not captured by a keyword search because the information does not 
contain the keywords being searched.

Jeffrey Epstein Hoped to Seed Human Race With His DNA 
New York Times 
By James B. Stewart, Matthew Goldstein and Jessica Silver-Greenberg 
7/31/19 
Jeffrey E. Epstein, the wealthy financier who is accused of sex trafficking, had an unusual dream: He hoped to 
seed the human race with his DNA by impregnating women at his vast New Mexico ranch. 
Mr. Epstein over the years confided to scientists and others about his scheme, according to four people familiar 
with his thinking, although there is no evidence that it ever came to fruition. 
Mr. Epstein's vision reflected his longstanding fascination with what has become known as transhumanism: the 
science of improving the human population through technologies like genetic engineering and artificial 
intelligence. Critics have likened transhumanism to a modern-day version of eugenics, the discredited field of 
improving the human race through controlled breeding. 
Mr. Epstein, who was charged in July with the sexual trafficking of girls as young as 14, was a serial illusionist: 
He lied about the identities of his clients, his wealth, his financial prowess, his personal achievements. But he 
managed to use connections and charisma to cultivate valuable relationships with business and political leaders. 
Interviews with more than a dozen of his acquaintances, as well as public documents, show that he used the same 
tactics to insinuate himself into an elite scientific community, thus allowing him to pursue his interests in 
eugenics and other fringe fields like cryonics. 
Lawyers for Mr. Epstein, who has pleaded not guilty to the sex-trafficking charges, did not respond to requests 
for comment. 
Mr. Epstein attracted a glittering array of prominent scientists. They included the Nobel Prize-winning physicist 
Murray Gell-Mann, who discovered the quark; the theoretical physicist and best-selling author Stephen 
Hawking; the paleontologist and evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould; Oliver Sacks, the neurologist and 
best-selling author; George M. Church, a molecular engineer who has worked to identify genes that could be 
altered to create superior humans; and the M.I.T. theoretical physicist Frank Wilczek, a Nobel laureate. 
The lure for some of the scientists was Mr. Epstein's money. He dangled financing for their pet projects. Some of 
the scientists said that the prospect of financing blinded them to the seriousness of his sexual transgressions, and 
even led them to give credence to some of Mr. Epstein's half-baked scientific musings. 
Scientists gathered at dinner parties at Mr. Epstein's Manhattan mansion, where Dom Perignon and expensive 
wines flowed freely, even though Mr. Epstein did not drink. He hosted buffet lunches at Harvard's Program for 
Evolutionary Dynamics, which he had helped start with a $6.5 million donation. 
Others flew to conferences sponsored by Mr. Epstein in the United States Virgin Islands and were feted on his 
private island there. Once, the scientists — including Mr. Hawking — crowded on board a submarine that Mr. 
Epstein had chartered. 
The Harvard cognitive psychologist Steven Pinker said he was invited by colleagues — including Martin 
Nowak, a Harvard professor of mathematics and biology, and the theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss — to 
"salons and coffee klatsches" at which Mr. Epstein would hold court. 
While some of Mr. Pinker's peers hailed Mr. Epstein as brilliant, Mr. Pinker described him as an "intellectual 
impostor." 
EFTA00018442
--- PAGE 3 ---
"He would abruptly change the subject, A.D.D.-style, dismiss an observation with an adolescent wisecrack," Mr. 
Pinker said. 
Another scientist cultivated by Mr. Epstein, Jaron Lanier, a prolific author who is a founding father of virtual 
reality, said that Mr. Epstein's ideas did not amount to science, in that they did not lend themselves to rigorous 
proof. Mr. Lanier said Mr. Epstein had once hypothesized that atoms behaved like investors in a marketplace. 
Mr. Lanier said he had declined any funding from Mr. Epstein and that he had met with him only once after Mr. 
Epstein in 2008 pleaded guilty to charges of soliciting prostitution from a minor. 
Mr. Epstein was willing to finance research that others viewed as bizarre. He told one scientist that he was 
bankrolling efforts to identify a mysterious particle that might trigger the feeling that someone is watching you. 
At one session at Harvard, Mr. Epstein criticized efforts to reduce starvation and provide health care to the poor 
because doing so increased the risk of overpopulation, said Mr. Pinker, who was there. Mr. Pinker said he had 
rebutted the argument, citing research showing that high rates of infant mortality simply caused people to have 
more children. Mr. Epstein seemed annoyed, and a Harvard colleague later told Mr. Pinker that he had been 
"voted off the island" and was no longer welcome at Mr. Epstein's gatherings. 
Then there was Mr. Epstein's interest in eugenics. 
On multiple occasions starting in the early 2000s, Mr. Epstein told scientists and businessmen about his 
ambitions to use his New Mexico ranch as a base where women would be inseminated with his sperm and would 
give birth to his babies, according to two award-winning scientists and an adviser to large companies and 
wealthy individuals, all of whom Mr. Epstein told about it. 
It was not a secret. The adviser, for example, said he was told about the plans not only by Mr. Epstein, at a 
gathering at his Manhattan townhouse, but also by at least one prominent member of the business community. 
One of the scientists said Mr. Epstein divulged his idea in 2001 at a dinner at the same townhouse; the other 
recalled Mr. Epstein discussing it with him at a 2006 conference that he hosted in St. Thomas in the Virgin 
Islands. 
The idea struck all three as far-fetched and disturbing. There is no indication that it would have been against the 
law. 
Once, at a dinner at Mr. Epstein's mansion on Manhattan's Upper East Side, Mr. Lanier said he talked to a 
scientist who told him that Mr. Epstein's goal was to have 20 women at a time impregnated at his 33,000-square-
foot Zorro Ranch in a tiny town outside Santa Fe. Mr. Lanier said the scientist identified herself as working at 
NASA, but he did not remember her name. 
According to Mr. Lanier, the NASA scientist said Mr. Epstein had based his idea for a baby ranch on accounts of 
the Repository for Germinal Choice, which was to be stocked with the sperm of Nobel laureates who wanted to 
strengthen the human gene pool. (Only one Nobel Prize winner has acknowledged contributing sperm to it. The 
repository discontinued operations in 1999.) 
Mr. Lanier, the virtual-reality creator and author, said he had the impression that Mr. Epstein was using the 
dinner parties — where some guests were attractive women with impressive academic credentials — to screen 
candidates to bear Mr. Epstein's children. 
Mr. Epstein did not hide his interest in tinkering with genes — and in perpetuating his own DNA. 
One adherent of transhumanism said that he and Mr. Epstein discussed the financier's interest in cryonics, an 
unproven science in which people's bodies are frozen to be brought back to life in the future. Mr. Epstein told 
this person that he wanted his head and penis to be frozen. 
EFTA00018443
--- PAGE 4 ---
Southern Trust Company, Mr. Epstein's Virgin Island-incorporated business, disclosed in a local filing that it was 
engaged in DNA analysis. Calls to Southern Trust, which sponsored a science and math fair for school children 
in the Virgin Islands in 2014, were not returned. 
In 2011, a charity established by Mr. Epstein gave $20,000 to the Worldwide Transhumanist Association, which 
now operates under the name Humanity Plus. The group's website says that its goal is "to deeply influence a new 
generation of thinkers who dare to envision humanity's next steps." 
Mr. Epstein's foundation, which is now defunct, also gave $100,000 to pay the salary of Ben Goertzel, vice 
chairman of Humanity Plus, according to Mr. Goertzel's résumé. 
"I have no desire to talk about Epstein right now," Mr. Goertzel said in an email to The New York Times. "The 
stuff I'm reading about him in the papers is pretty disturbing and goes way beyond what I thought his misdoings 
and kinks were. Yecch." 
Alan M. Dershowitz, a professor emeritus of law at Harvard, recalled that at a lunch Mr. Epstein hosted in 
Cambridge, Mass., he steered the conversation toward the question of how humans could be improved 
genetically. Mr. Dershowitz said he was appalled, given the Nazis' use of eugenics to justify their genocidal 
effort to purify the Aryan race. 
Yet the lunches persisted. 
"Everyone speculated about whether these scientists were more interested in his views or more interested in his 
money," said Mr. Dershowitz, who was one of Mr. Epstein's defense lawyers in the 2008 case. 
Luminaries at Mr. Epstein's St. Thomas conference in 2006 included Mr. Hawking and the Caltech theoretical 
physicist Kip S. Thorne. One participant at that conference, which was ostensibly on the subject of gravity, 
recalled that Mr. Epstein wanted to talk about perfecting the human genome. Mr. Epstein said he was fascinated 
with how certain traits were passed on, and how that could result in superior humans. 
Mr. Epstein appears to have gained entree into the scientific community through John Brockman, a literary agent 
whose best-selling science writers include Richard Dawkins, Daniel Goleman and Jared Diamond. Mr. 
Brockman did not respond to requests for comment. 
For two decades, Mr. Brockman presided over a series of salons that matched his scientist-authors with potential 
benefactors. (The so-called "billionaires' dinners" apparently became a model for the gatherings at Mr. Epstein's 
East 71st Street townhouse, which included some of the same guests.) 
In 2004, Mr. Brockman hosted a dinner at the Indian Summer restaurant in Monterey, Calif, where Mr. Epstein 
was introduced to scientists, including Seth Lloyd, the M.I.T. physicist. Mr. Lloyd said that he found Mr. Epstein 
to be "charming" and to have "interesting ideas," although they "turned out to be quite vague." 
Also at the Indian Summer dinner, according to an account on the website of Mr. Brockman's Edge Foundation, 
were the Google founders Sergey Brim and Larry Page and Jeff Bezos, who was accompanied by his mother. 
"All the good-looking women were sitting with the physicists' table," Daniel Dubno, who was a CBS producer at 
the time and attended the dinner, was quoted as saying. Mr. Dubno told The Times that he did not recall the 
dinner or having said those words. 
Mr. Brockman was Mr. Gell-Mann's agent, and Mr. Gell-Mann, in the acknowledgments section of his 1995 
book "The Quark and the Jaguar," thanked Mr. Epstein for his financial support. 
EFTA00018444
--- PAGE 5 ---
However impressive his roster of scientific contacts, Mr. Epstein could not resist embellishing it. He claimed on 
one of his websites to have had "the privilege of sponsoring many prominent scientists," including Mr. Pinker, 
Mr. Thorne and the M.I.T. mathematician and geneticist Eric S. Lander. 
Mr. Pinker said he had never taken any financial or other support from Mr. Epstein. "Needless to say, I find 
Epstein's behavior reprehensible," he said. 
Mr. Thorne, who recently won a Nobel Prize, said he attended Mr. Epstein's 2006 conference, believing it to be 
co-sponsored by a reputable research center. Other than that, "I have had no contact with, relationship with, 
affiliation with or funding from Epstein," he said. "I unequivocally condemn his abhorrent actions involving 
minors." 
Lee McGuire, a spokesman for Mr. Lander, said he has had no relationship with Mr. Epstein. "Mr. Epstein 
appears to have made up lots of things," Mr. McGuire said, "and this seems to be among them." 
Some of Jeffrey Epstein's victims don't want new charges in South Florida 
South Florida Sun Sentinel 
By Marc Freeman 
7/30/19 
Financier Jeffrey Epstein has been branded a pervert and an abuser, but not all of his victims want to see him 
prosecuted further in South Florida. 
Some of the girls Epstein assaulted at his Palm Beach mansion before 2008 have already reached financial 
settlements with him and fear they'll lose their anonymity. Federal prosecutors — the ones who approved his 
lenient plea deal to begin with — say they fully support that position. 
Epstein faces separate federal sex trafficking charges in New York, but the debate about prosecuting him in 
South Florida will be resolved soon enough. A federal judge in West Palm Beach is considering whether to strike 
down parts of a controversial 2007 deal that gave him and unnamed co-conspirators immunity from federal 
charges. 
U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra ruled in February that Epstein's non-prosecution agreement violated the 
federal Crime Victims' Rights Act. Dozens of victims were improperly kept in the dark about it until after it had 
been finalized. 
Marra must decide how to rectify this violation 12 years later, after receiving arguments from lawyers for two of 
Epstein's victims, prosecutors and Epstein. 
The victims in the case, cited as Jane Does, say the necessary remedy is for Epstein to face what they say are 
long overdue charges in Florida. 
"To be sure, Jane Doe 1 and 2 very much appreciate the laudable efforts of the diligent prosecutors in New 
York," their lawyers wrote. "But those New York charges, important though they are, still leave Epstein's crimes 
in Florida uncharged and all of his co-conspirators at large." 
Lawyers for the U.S. government disagree. 
They concede that prosecutors back then "fell short" of treating victims properly as they reached a settlement 
with Epstein. But the attorneys now contend "the past cannot be undone" and the deal must be upheld under the 
law. 
Among their arguments is that many victims clearly want to let it go, because they are content with financial 
settlements they obtained from Epstein, and his 2008 guilty plea to two state prostitution charges. That plea 
EFTA00018445
--- PAGE 6 ---
resulted in 13 months in Palm Beach County Jail and registering as a sex offender. 
The prosecutors say they reached this position based on "conversations" with the victims and their lawyers, 
without giving a specific number. 
Attorney Spencer Kuvin of West Palm Beach said he represents one victim who met with the U.S. Attorney's 
Office in April. 
"She said she'd like to see him prosecuted and put in jail," Kuvin said. "She said, `I don't know if that's a 
realistic possibility, but that's what I want.'" 
He said it's not surprising that other victims are less inclined to participate. 
"When you have so many victims, you're going to have just as many different opinions as to how it should be 
handled," Kuvin said. "But that shouldn't stop the prosecution of a predator. One victim that wants to come 
forward ... is enough to put him away." 
The federal prosecutors explained that while some victims "would like to see Epstein prosecuted for his crimes, 
they valued anonymity above all and were not willing to speak with law enforcement or otherwise participate in 
any criminal or civil litigation due to the risk that their involvement may become known to family, friends, or the 
public." 
This is not to say there aren't many victims who are eager to see Epstein face new charges in South Florida, 
wrote Byung J. Pak, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia, and Jill E. Steinberg and Nathan P. 
Kitchens, special attorneys for the Southern District of Florida. 
But they conclude that reopening their cases against Epstein in South Florida still "exacerbates the harm to 
victims who have attempted to readjust their lives in the interim." 
Kuvin said he agrees, "It's a valid concern for some of the victims." 
Attorneys for two victims in the pending Crime Victims' Right Act litigation blasted the government's reasoning 
to leave Epstein's non-prosecution agreement in place. 
Lawyers Bradley Edwards, Paul Cassell and Jack Scarola say any South Florida victims who are not willing to 
prosecute Epstein because of privacy concerns can simply decline to do so and remain anonymous. 
The lawyers say there's no way that prosecuting Epstein for some victims would harm other victims unless the 
prosecutors somehow disclose their identities in the process. 
"The Government's argument thus boils down to a stop-us-before-we-do-something-bad claim that deserves no 
credence from the Court," wrote Edwards and his co-counsel on behalf of the two women, identified as Jane Doe 
I and Jane Doe 2. 
They also pointed out that the prosecutors weren't asserting the alleged "risk" to some victims outweighs 
obtaining justice for their clients. 
"But in any event, on closer examination, the Government's argument turns out to be vaporous," they wrote this 
month. 
Epstein's lawyers told the judge they support the South Florida prosecutors' arguments that the once-secret deal 
shouldn't be blown up to allow new charges. 
Jeffrey Epstein faces 'a million pages' of evidence: defense lawyer 
EFTA00018446
--- PAGE 7 ---
New York Post 
By Andrew Denney and Bruce Golding 
7/31/19 
Prosecutors have 1 million pages of evidence against Jeffrey Epstein, his lawyer revealed in court Monday —
without shedding any new light on the jailhouse incident that left the convicted pedophile with bruises on his 
neck. 
No marks were visible on Epstein's neck, and he never appeared to be in pain during the 15-minute hearing in 
Manhattan federal court. 
The judge overseeing the case tentatively scheduled Epstein's trial for June 2020 after a prosecutor said the child 
sex-trafficking charges against him should be resolved as "swiftly as possible." 
"We don't think any delay in this is in the public interest," Manhattan Assistant US Attorney 
said. 
Epstein's trial is expected to last four to six weeks, and the defense will have all the prosecution's evidence 
against the multimillionaire financier by Oct. 31, she said. 
Defense lawyer Martin Weinberg objected to starting the trial before September 2020, saying, "We need time to 
review a million pages of discovery." 
But Judge Richard Berman said he was blocking out time in June 2020 on the presumption that the defense 
would be ready by then. 
Weinberg didn't make any mention of the July 23 incident in which law enforcement sources have said Epstein, 
66, was found sprawled on the floor of his cell in the Metropolitan Correctional Center, where he's being held 
without bail. 
Weinberg declined to answer questions about the incident outside court. 
Epstein, who wore dark blue jail scrubs over a brown T-shirt, didn't speak during the hearing. 
He's pleaded not guilty to accusations he sexually abused dozens of underage girls - some as young as 14 — in 
his Upper East Side townhouse and his waterfront mansion in Palm Beach, Florida, between 2002 and 2005. 
Berman set a Sept. 13 deadline for defense motions in the case, and Weinberg said he planned to seek dismissal 
of a conspiracy charge on grounds of double jeopardy tied to allegations that underpinned a non-prosecution 
agreement that Epstein struck in 2008 with then-Miami US Attorney Alex Acosta. 
That deal was exposed last year in an award-winning series of stories by the Miami Herald, and controversy that 
erupted following Epstein's July 6 arrest forced Acosta to resign as President Trump's labor secretary. 
Jeffrey Epstein appears in court for first time since reported jail injuries 
The Guardian 
By Victoria Bekiempis 
7/31/19 
Financier Jeffrey Epstein looked physically healthy when he appeared in court in New York on Wednesday in his 
sex trafficking case, about a week after reportedly being found unconscious in his jail cell with neck injuries. 
He wore dark blue jail scrubs during his brief appearance in Manhattan federal criminal court on Wednesday 
morning, in a proceeding scheduled before the apparent incident behind bars last week. 
There were no signs of injuries that had been reported at the time and he appeared well and more neatly 
presented than at some previous hearings. 
EFTA00018447
--- PAGE 8 ---
The Jeffrey Epstein scandal 
His lawyers did not bring up the incident in court and refused to comment on the topic following the hearing, 
which focused on scheduling issues. 
Prosecutor 
asked for a June 2020 trial date to be set, telling the judge: "We don't think that any delay 
in this case is in the public interest." 
The Manhattan US attorney's office alleged earlier in July that Epstein "sexually exploited and abused dozens of 
minor girls" from 2002 to 2005. Some of his victims were just 14 years old, prosecutors alleged. 
The disgraced financier, who was arrested on 6 July, pleaded not guilty several weeks ago. 
Epstein has long been accused of sexually abusing underage girls. He also has purported connections to Donald 
Trump, Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew, and moved in elite circles, including for several years in a relationship 
with Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late British media tycoon Robert Maxwell. 
Epstein and the Miami US attorney's office, headed at the time by Alexander Acosta, brokered a plea deal in 
2008 that closed a federal inquiry involving at least 40 teenage girls. 
Under this arrangement, Epstein pleaded guilty to state charges, which presented far less potential jail time than 
if he had faced federal charges. The Miami Herald reporter Julie K Brown exposed the secretive nature of this 
agreement. Acosta resigned from his post as Trump's labor secretary following extensive criticism of the deal. 
Epstein has unsuccessfully requested bail while awaiting trial. The 66-year-old, who registered as a sex offender 
following the Florida case, had maintained through lawyers that he neither posed a danger nor risk of flight. 
In rejecting Epstein's request, Judge Richard Berman said, "the government has established danger to others and 
to the community by clear and convincing evidence", adding: "I doubt that any bail package can overcome a 
danger to the community." 
Epstein's lawyers are appealing against the decision, according to court filings. 
Late last week, Judge Berman also ruled in favor of prosecutors' proposed protective order, which will keep case 
materials relating to "the government's ongoing investigation of uncharged individuals" under wraps. 
Judge sets tentative date for Jeffrey Epstein's trial 
Associated Press

7/31/19 
A subdued Jeffrey Epstein listened passively in court Wednesday as a judge said he won't face trial on sex 
trafficking charges before June 2020, and more likely a few months afterward. 
There was no mention at the Manhattan federal court appearance or any visible sign of injuries after the 66-year-
old financier was found on the floor of his cell last week with neck bruises. 
Epstein's lawyer, Martin Weinberg, refused to say what might have left his client with neck bruises after the court 
hearing. 
Assistant U.S. Attorney 
urged a June trial date for the man accused of arranging to have sex with 
girls as young as age 14, saying there is "a public interest in bringing this case to trial as swiftly as possible." 
But Weinberg said the case is far from "ordinary," adding the defense team won't be ready before Labor Day 
2020. He said prosecutors delayed bringing charges that relate to alleged crimes that occurred in the early 2000s 
at Epstein's residences in Manhattan and Florida. 
EFTA00018448
--- PAGE 9 ---
U.S. District Judge Richard M. Berman said a trial projected to last four to six weeks could tentatively begin 
June 8, but he'll likely defer to defense lawyers' needs if they are not ready. 
Epstein's demeanor in court was noticeably different from previous appearances, when he was actively engaged 
with his lawyers and looking through papers. 
On Wednesday, he sat quietly, his hands folded in front of his face through much of the 20-minute proceeding. 
Occasionally, he looked toward courtroom artists and reporters seated in a jury box. 
Epstein has remained at the Metropolitan Correction Center, which is adjacent to the downtown Manhattan 
courthouse. 
He has pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking charges that carry the potential for up to 45 years in prison. 
Berman refused bail after concluding he is a danger to the community and a flight risk. Prosecutors have said 
they fear he might try to influence a growing number of witnesses who support charges that he recruited and 
abused dozens of girls in New York and Florida in the early 2000s. His lawyers had argued he should be allowed 
to stay under house arrest in his Manhattan mansion. 
His lawyers say an agreement reached with federal prosecutors a dozen years ago disallows the charges and they 
say he has committed no new crimes. 
The lawyers agreed to file written arguments about the agreement and double jeopardy claims by Sept. 13. Oral 
arguments will occur in October. 
The non-prosecution deal was reached before he pleaded guilty in state court in Florida to prostitution-related 
charges involving underage girls. Afterward, he was required to register as a sex offender and pay restitution to 
many victims. While he served a 13-month jail term, he was permitted to leave jail to work for 12 hours a day, 
six days a week. 
Epstein was arrested July 6 when he arrived at a New Jersey airport on a private jet from Paris, where he has a 
home. 
Did Jeffrey Epstein try to kill himself? He and his lawyer, back in court, aren't saying

Victims of Jeffrey Epstein share the emotional toll that sexual abuse has taken on them — even years after the 
abuse occurred. Miami Herald reporter Julie K. Brown interviewed the young women, most speaking for the first 
time about Epstein. BY EMILY MICHOT I JULIE K. BROWN 
For the first time since he was found semi-conscious in his jail cell with telltale bruise marks on his neck, 
accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein appeared in a Manhattan court room. 
Epstein — onetime friend of the rich and powerful, including current President Donald Trump and past President 
Bill Clinton — learned Wednesday that he will not face trial until at least next June. 
The multimillionaire part-time resident of Palm Beach sat subdued in front of U.S. District Court Judge Richard 
M. Berman. The 66-year-old defendant wore dark blue jail scrubs and glasses. 
His lawyer, Martin Weinberg, declined to reveal any details about the incident at the Metropolitan Correctional 
Center, which occurred July 23, including whether it was a suicide attempt, an attack by a fellow detainee or 
something else. His client is being held without bond. 
Wednesday's hearing in New York City lasted just 15 minutes. 
EFTA00018449
--- PAGE 10 ---
Epstein, a financier who owns homes around the world, including a waterfront estate in Palm Beach, was 
arrested July 6, nearly eight months after the Miami Herald published Perversion of Justice, a two-year 
investigation of a much-reviled secret plea deal in 2007-2008 that spared Epstein a sweeping federal indictment 
despite allegations of sexual abuse by nearly three dozen underage girls. 
He had just arrived from France at New Jersey's Teterboro airport on his private jet when authorities met him 
and took him into custody. 
During the early- and mid-2000s, Epstein allegedly ran what amounted to a sexual pyramid scheme, using 
recruiters to lure girls as young as 14 to his lavish Palm Beach and Manhattan mansions with the promise that 
they would receive $200 to give a man a massage. The girls have alleged that they were coerced into sex. 
The girls were paid additional money if they would recruit others girls, police and court records allege. Epstein 
had assistants schedule as many as three visits a day. 
Rather than face federal charges that could have put him away for life, Epstein pleaded guilty in state court to 
minor prostitution charges and served just a year in the county stockade — which permitted him to leave the 
lockup for his luxurious downtown West Palm Beach office for 12 hours a day, six days a week. This "work 
release" arrangement, highly unusual for a sex offender, is now under criminal investigation by order of the Palm 
Beach sheriff, Ric Bradshaw, who oversees the stockade and approved the work release. 
Although Assistant U.S. Attorney 
said it is important to move swiftly ahead with Epstein's court 
case, his defense attorney said he needs time in light of the approximately one million pages of documents that 
that comprise the evidence collected against his client. 
Labor Secretary Alex Acosta held a press conference to defend his role in handling the Jeffrey Epstein sexual 
abuse case. Acosta was a U.S. Attorney who approved the Epstein plea deal in 2008. By CSPAN 
In the meantime, Epstein will be given a chance to argue that the non-prosecution agreement, executed in 2008, 
gave him, his schedulers, his alleged madam and others immunity from federal charges and that the new charges 
constitute impermissible double jeopardy. 
In its series of articles, the Herald highlighted the role of Alexander Acosta, then-U.S. attorney for the Southern 
District of Florida, in approving the immunity agreement, including a controversial stipulation that Epstein's 
accusers not be told of the arrangement. Facing searing criticism after Epstein's arrest, Acosta resigned his post 
as President Trump's labor secretary. 
Jeffrey Epstein could face sex trafficking trial next June 
Reuters 
7/31/19 
Financier Jeffrey Epstein could go to trial on charges of sex trafficking involving dozens of underage girls as 
early as next June, though his lawyers told a court on Wednesday they may need more time. 
At a hearing in Manhattan federal court, prosecutors sought a June 2020 trial date, while a lawyer for Epstein 
asked that it wait another three months. 
The lawyer, Martin Weinberg, said Epstein and his legal team needed more time to review evidence, expected to 
total more than 1 million pages. 
U.S. District Judge Richard Berman said he would tentatively set aside time for a trial beginning June 8, but 
revisit the issue later. He said he normally allowed defendants more time to prepare if they wished. 
Assistant U.S. Attorney 
said a trial is expected to last four to six weeks. 
EFTA00018450
--- PAGE 11 ---
Prosecutors have accused Epstein of arranging for girls under the age of 18 to perform nude "massages" and 
other sex acts, and of paying some girls to recruit others. Epstein has pleaded not guilty. 
Wednesday's hearing occurred one week after Epstein was reportedly found unconscious and with neck injuries 
in his jail cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in downtown Manhattan. 
Epstein, dressed in blue jail scrubs, had no visible injuries on Wednesday. His lawyers declined to comment on 
the reports after the hearing. 
Epstein is appealing Berman's July 18 denial of his request to remain under house arrest in his $77 million 
mansion on Manhattan's Upper East Side while awaiting trial. 
The charges against Epstein focus on alleged misconduct from at least 2002 to 2005. 
They followed Epstein's 2008 guilty plea to state prostitution charges in Florida, in exchange for the Justice 
Department's agreement not to prosecute him on similar charges. 
Epstein served 13 months in jail and agreed to register as a sex offender under the 2008 agreement, which is now 
widely considered too lenient. 
His lawyers have argued this month that the agreement barred federal prosecutors in Manhattan from pursuing 
the current case over the same conduct. Weinberg said at Wednesday's hearing that they intended to file motions 
on the issue. 
U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman, whose office is overseeing the current case, has said there is no such bar. 
Epstein Lawyers Ask for a Year to Review a Million Pages 
Bloomberg 
By Chris Dolmetsch , Bob Van Voris , and Patricia Hurtado 
7/31/19 
Jeffrey Epstein's lawyers say they need at least a year to review a blizzard of documents prosecutors have 
gathered against the fund manager as they prepare to defend him against charges of sex trafficking in minors and 
conspiracy. 
Prosecutors asked a judge to schedule Epstein's trial for next June, but defense attorney Martin Weinberg said his 
team wanted to wait until September 2020, because they haven't yet begun to receive documents from the 
government. 
"We need time to receive a million pages of discovery and prepare to defend a four- to six-week trial," Weinberg 
said during a brief hearing in Manhattan on Wednesday. "We need time to assess events that occurred 14 to 17 
years ago." 
The judge set a tentative trial date of June 8 and asked the parties to keep him updated on their progress. 
Epstein, who didn't speak in court, was arrested on July 6 after stepping off his private plane in New Jersey from 
a trip to Paris. He has pleaded not guilty and said he has fully complied with the law for more than 14 years. 
Marks on Neck 
Epstein is accused of molesting teenage girls from 2002 to 2005. He pleaded guilty in 2008 to Florida state 
charges of soliciting prostitution, after striking a non-prosecution agreement with the U.S. Federal prosecutors in 
New York say they are not bound by the deal as they now pursue their own charges. 
EFTA00018451
--- PAGE 12 ---
In court Wednesday, there was no discussion of what happened to the 66-year-old Epstein last week at New 
York's Metropolitan Correctional Center, where he has been held since his arrest. People familiar with the matter 
said he was found injured and unresponsive in his cell, with marks on his neck. Authorities are investigating 
whether he was assaulted, possibly by another inmate, or whether the injuries were self-inflicted. Weinberg 
declined to respond to questions about the incident outside court. 
Also in court was Gloria Allred, the activist lawyer who has represented women accusing Roy Moore, Bill 
Cosby and President Donald Trump of sexual assault. After the hearing, she said she was representing other 
Epstein accusers who "were not in the Florida case." She said other women have approached her about their 
experiences with Epstein but were reluctant to discuss them for fear of retaliation. 
The U.S. attorney in Manhattan, Geoffrey Berman, has urged others who may be victims to come forward and 
cooperate with the government. Allred declined to say whether her clients have spoken to prosecutors. 
The case is U.S. v. Epstein, 19-cr-490, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

By News Editorial Board 
7/29/19 
The ethics specialists are right and so are the members of a special ethics panel, including both Democrats and 
Republicans, who are paying attention. Good for them. The conduct of Rep. Chris Collins, R-Clarence, exposed 
a range of issues Congress needs to treat as tumors, and cut them out. 
Collins was indicted last year on allegations of insider trading. But he was routinely smashing ethical standards —
of both formal and common sense varieties — before he was ever charged with a crime. 
A year before Collins was indicted, the Office of Congressional Ethics reported that it found "a substantial 
reason to believe" that Collins violated federal law by touting the stock of Innate Immunotherapeutics, an 
Australian biotech firm, based on inside information. 
The office also said Collins may have broken House ethics rules by persuading National Institutes of Health 
officials to meet with a staffer from that company. 
At least as troubling are the actions Collins took that were not deemed to be ethical violations. Speaking to a 
bipartisan House task force charged with drawing up new ethics rules based on Collins' arrest, ethics experts 
worried about lawmakers who sit on the boards of privately owned companies, or who serve as partners in other 
businesses or who are directors of nonprofit organizations. Collins still does all three. 
Earlier this year, in response to Collins' arrest, the House barred lawmakers from serving on the boards of 
publicly traded companies. Collins did that, too, as a board member — and leading stockholder — of Innate 
Immunotherapeutics. It's how prosecutors say he obtained the insider information that led to his arrest. 
There was more. Collins authored a provision of the 2016 "21st Century Cures Act" that sped drug approval for 
companies like Innate. Collins, with a straight face, claimed there was no conflict because Innate had no business 
before U.S. regulators. But in 2017, the company practically beamed that it had "received clearance from the 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the Company's Investigational New Drug (IND) application lodged last 
month."

The fact that Collins' role in the legislation could also have benefited other companies — and may even have been 
worthy of passage — does nothing to change the associated fact that he was pushing for legislation whose 
adoption could have lined his pockets. It was classic self-dealing. 
The drug in question was meant to treat multiple sclerosis. It failed in clinical trials in 2017 and prosecutors say 
Collins illegally spread the word to family and others who were able to sell their stock before its price collapsed 
on the bad news. 
Collins has pleaded not guilty to the charges. His trial is scheduled for February. But regardless of what a judge 
or jury ultimately decides about Collins, he has shown himself to be indifferent to the need for a member of 
Congress to conduct himself in a way that reflects well on the institution and on the voters who entrust him with 
public office. 
In that, he has shown Congress that it needs to act. It can't count on its members using good judgment, especially 
when millions of dollars are at stake. 
The good news is that it seems ready to meet that public obligation. It is considering measures that would 
prohibit lawmakers from serving as partners in limited liability corporations, joining committees that oversee 
their business interests and serving on the boards of nonprofit organizations. Staff members would also be 
barred. 
Sadly, some Republican members have defended Collins, despite the clear conflicts of interest. But the 
Republican on the ethics task force, Rep. Van Taylor of Texas, expressed no disagreement with the panel's 
Democrat, Pennsylvania Rep. Susan Wild, who said she expected to move "rather quickly" on writing new rules. 
Taylor sees the tasks as "very narrow," focused on preventing lawmakers from serving in outside positions that 
could pose conflicts. The remarkable thing is that those restrictions need to be put in writing. Thank Collins for 
that. 
Securities and Commodities Fraud 
Stewart 
Southern District Will Pursue A Retrial Of "Silver Platter" Case 
Forbes 
By Walter Pavlo 
7/30/19 
Sean Stewart was indicted on insider trading charges back in May 2015 during U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara's 
reign over the Southern District of New York. Now, over four years since his indictment, Sean can reflect back 
on a wild journey of being convicted, sentenced to 3 years prison, having that conviction overturned, being 
released from prison halfway through his term and, now, having a new date to go back to trial to face the charges 
again. 
Sean Stewart was indicted on insider trading for passing material non-public information on potential deals to his 
father, Robert, who then passed it on to his former friend and trader, Richard Cunniffe. Sean, a Yale graduate 
who had worked in investment banking at JPMorgan Chase and Perella Weinberg, mentioned some details about 
his work while talking to Robert. Sean's information made it to Cunniffe who made over a million dollars on the 
trades, sharing a small amount (less $100,000) with Robert. How much did Sean make on the trades? ZERO 
dollars. He had no idea that Cunniffe traded because he did not even know who Cunniffe was. 
It was a clear case of misappropriation where information was used without Sean's knowledge, so it was not a 
"classical" insider trading case. However, Bharara's team of U.S. attorneys was looking for cases that targeted 
EFTA00018453
--- PAGE 14 ---
wealthy Wall Street traders who seemed to have an advantage over the average trader. Sean's case was a good 
fit. 
Cunniffe was busted by the FBI and soon became a government informant, taping calls and other meetings with 
Robert. In one of those calls, Robert stated that Sean said of the information he had passed on to Cunniffe, "I 
can't believe it. I handed you this on a silver platter and you didn't invest." So the primary evidence in the case, 
the case that came to be known as the "silver platter" case, was based on a statement that was attributed to Sean. 
It's a phrase that Sean's new defense team wants to be excluded from the proceedings. 
When Robert was arrested, under duress of FBI questioning, he said nine (9) times that Sean was not in on his 
scheme with Cunniffe (here is entire tape transcript here). Robert also admitted his own role and that of 
Cunniffe's during the interrogation. When it came to trial, neither that tape nor Robert's testimony was allowed 
because of legal maneuvering by prosecutors. The video tape was suppressed and Robert did not testify due to 
threats from prosecutors that he would be charged for perjury due to his conflicting accounts. Here is what the 
jury missed from that tape: 
FBI AGENT: Tell me about the first time that Sean gave you information on a deal. 
ROBERT STEWART: Well, uh, I wouldn't characterize any of these as — 
I mean Sean would mention stuff. I 
don't think he had any idea that I would trade on any of this stuff Uh, I've never mentioned that I did, to him. 
Ummm 
AGENT: If that's true, how do you explain the comment you made to Rick [Cunniffe] that Sean got angry with 
you when he gave you this information on a silver platter and you didn't invest. 
ROBERT: Uhh, I think I was just saying that to Rick because Sean said, oh, you know, ahh, all these deals, you 
know, you — 
if you were trading you could make like millions of dollars. And I said, you know, Sean, no 
one's going to trade and make millions of dollars on this stuff. That wasn't his intention. 
Robert took the 5th but did submit an affidavit that if he were to testify he would have said Sean did not know 
about the trades by Cunniffe. 
Looking back at the trial, there was not a single email, document, or text message that suggested that Sean was a 
knowingly participated in the trading scheme. This is interesting since there were so many incriminating 
documents between Cunniffe and Robert. There were no witnesses who gave testimony on Sean's knowledge 
and intent, including Cunniffe, the cooperator, who on the stand acknowledged that he never knew Sean. 
Furtnermore, trading records and actions undertaken by Sean suggest he did not know trading had taken place. 
Last fall, the 2nd Circuit overturned Sean's conviction, something rare in most cases, especially a reversal on an 
evidentiary ruling, which suggests the 2nd Circuit felt that Sean may be innocent and the judge's mistakes 
resulted in an unfair trial. The appellate court ruled that Robert's post-arrest video interrogation should have 
been allowed. Sean was released from prison and has been in legal limbo until the SDNY decided that they 
would move to move forward with another trial on the same charges. 
Stewart will have a new judge this time around. U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain was replaced by Judge 
Rakoff, a man who seems to be on a mission to define insider trading laws himself. He also has new attorneys 
Steven M. Witzel, Lawrence Gerschwer, R. David Gallo and Leigh G. Rome of Fried Frank Harris Shriver & 
Jacobson LLP. 
If Sean is found guilty, he would face the prospect of being sentenced to prison and returning to prison to 
complete a term. On the other hand, it would not be out of the question for Judge Rakoff to give him "time 
served" in prison even if Sean is found guilty. Rakoff, not a fan of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, seems to 
be one of those judges that uses common sense in his approach to sentencing. Earlier this week, Rakoff 
EFTA00018454
--- PAGE 15 ---
sentenced a man to 14 months in prison for knowingly leaking insider information on Sherwin Williams' 
acquisition of Valspar. 
While Sean may have made some mistakes, these could have been handled by the companies he worked for and, 
at the most severe, an enforcement action by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SDNY seems intent 
on trying to interpret insider trading laws by putting on elaborate trials with the threat of putting people in prison 
for years. It is a waste of resources. 
It looks like the ghost of Bharara still haunts the SDNY. 
Thompson 
Easton man accused of stealing $7M via fake Bitcoin transactions 
Lehigh Valley Live 
By Sarah Cassi 
7/30/19 
An Easton man who headed a cryptocurrency escrow company was arrested last week on federal charges he 
allegedly stole $7 million from two companies by lying about Bitcoin transactions. 
Jon Barry Thompson, also known as J. Barry Thompson, was the principal of Volantis, which included a 
cryptocurrency escrow company called Volantis Escrow Platform LLC and a related company, Volantis Market 
Making LCC. 
The 48-year-old Thompson was arrested in Easton, and was charged with two counts each of commodities fraud 
and wire fraud. Easton police assisted in serving the arrest warrant at 6:15 a.m. Thursday at Thompson's West 
Burke Street home on College Hill. 
What happens to the money when a criminal's stash is in bitcoin? 
When a criminal's stash is in bitcoin, the stakes are now much higher in forfeiture cases with the soaring value of 
the virtual currency. 
Thompson was released after posting $500,000 bond. Messages left for comment at a phone number listed for 
Thompson and for his defense attorney, Matthew Siembieda, were not immediately returned. 
Prosecutors said Thompson stole $7 million from two companies after lying about transactions of the peer-to-
peer digital currency Bitcoin — $3 million from one company and $4 million from a second. 
Thompson offered minimized settlement default risk in cryptocurrency transactions, and claimed there was no 
risk of default, prosecutors allege. 
In June and July 2018, Thompson convinced the first company to send Volantis more than $3 million for a 
Bitcoin purchase, prosecutors allege. Thompson allegedly assured the company he had the Bitcoin in hand and 
that money could not be lost. 
Thompson took the money, but never provided the company the promised Bitcoin or returned its money, 
prosecutors said. 
Thompson allegedly gave the company a fake account statement showing he had the company's money but in 
reality sent the more than $3 million to a third-party entity purportedly in exchange for Bitcoin without first 
receiving any of the Bitcoin in hand. 
EFTA00018455
--- PAGE 16 ---
In July 2018, Thompson allegedly convinced a second company to send Volantis more than $4 million for 
Bitcoin purchases. Again, Thompson is accused of sending a substantial portion of the money to a third party 
without first receiving any Bitcoin in return, prosecutors allege. 
Thompson never gave the second company any Bitcoin and did not return its money, prosecutors said. 
"Jon Thompson induced investors to engage in cryptocurrency transactions through his company, Volantis 
Market Making, by touting a transaction structure that would eliminate any risk of loss during the purchase," 
Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said in a news release. "As his clients soon realized, however, 
Thompson's representations were false, and these cryptocurrency investors ultimately lost all of the money they 
had entrusted with him because of his lies." 
FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge Sweeney said Thompson used phrases and terminology that the victimized 
companies didn't understand, and he "allegedly preyed on their ignorance of the emerging cryptocurrency." 
"Thompson allegedly thought no one would ask where their actual money went when they trusted him to invest 
in Bitcoin," Sweeney said. 
The complaint doesn't identify the companies allegedly victimized by Thompson. 
Forbes previously reported Symphony, an Irish investment company that specializes in trading cryptocurrencies, 
gave Thompson 3.6 million Euros to purchase Bitcoin on its behalf. 
Symphony never received any Bitcoin and its money was never returned. 
In that case, the plaintiff withdrew the complaint it had brought in federal court in Pennsylvania and, instead, 
reached a private settlement with Thompson. Thompson then breached the agreement by failing to make the first 
settlement payment, Forbes reported. 
Pinto-Thomaz 
Popular Paint Brand Insider Trading Results In Prison Term: Feds 
Patch 
By Chris Dehnel 
7/30/19 
A former analyst for a major financial ratings agency is to spend more than a year in prison for an insider trading 
scheme involving his hairdresser, a jeweler and two major paint brands sold prominently in Connecticut. 
Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States Attorney for the southern district of New York, announced that Sebastian 
Pinto-Thomaz, 34, a former credit ratings analyst at Standard & Poor's, was sentenced in Manhattan federal court 
to 14 months in prison for participating in two schemes to trade on material, nonpublic information in advance of 
the Sherwin-Williams Company's acquisition of the Valspar Corporation. 
Valspar is the brand sold by Lowe's. 
Pinto-Thomaz was convicted on April 26, following a jury trial before U.S. District Judge Jed S. Rakoff, who 
also imposed Monday's sentence. 
In summarizing the case, Berman said, "As an employee of Standard & Poor's, Sebastian Pinto-Thomaz was 
privy to potentially lucrative information about business acquisition plans. Instead of protecting that information, 
EFTA00018456
--- PAGE 17 ---
as he had sworn to do, he shared it with a friend and with his hairdresser. In turn, they bet on a stock that they 
knew to be a sure thing, and raked in nearly $300,000 in profits. Pinto-Thomaz painted himself into a corner 
when he and his co-defendants exploited insider information to reap illegal profits. Now they all face time in 
prison for their misdeeds." 
When a company announces an acquisition, the acquiring company often seeks the opinion of a credit rating 
agency regarding the potential impact that the acquisition could have on the acquiring company's 
creditworthiness, Berman said. Therefore, companies often contact rating agencies before an acquisition is 
publicly announced in order to secure the rating agency's views on how a possible acquisition could impact a 
company's credit rating, he said. 
All major rating agencies offer a service — sometimes known as a Rating Evaluation Service, or RES — that 
provides the company with a rating committee decision with respect to a proposed acquisition. 
In March 2016, Standard and Poor's, a credit rating agency in New York, assigned Pinto-Thomazto work on a 
RES for the Sherwin-Williams Company in advance of its contemplated but unannounced acquisition of the 
Valspar Corporation, according to casae records. 
In connection with the assignment, Pinto-Thomaz received material, nonpublic or "inside" information the deal 
about Sherwin-Williams's planned acquisition of Valspar prior to the public announcement of the acquisition. 
S&P's written policies prohibited the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, which included the 
inside information, Berman said. 
During his tenure at S&P, Pinto-Thomaz reviewed and certified his duties of loyalty and confidentiality to S&P 
and its clients, according to case records. 
In March 2016, Pinto-Thomaz passed the inside information about the paint merger to Jeremy Millul, a friend, 
and to Abell Oujaddou, his hairdresser, so that they could "use it to make profitable trades in Valspar stock and 
options.," Berman said. 
On March 21, 2016, the first trading day after the public announcement of the acquisition, the price of Valspar 
stock increased approximately 23 percent over the prior day's close. 
Millul, a Manhattan jeweler opened a brokerage account on March 13, 2016, and shortly thereafter purchased 
480 shares of Valspar common stock, case records show. On March 18, 2016, the last trading day before the 
acquisition was publicly announced, Millul also purchased 75 out-of-the-money Valspar call options, according 
to case records. 
After the acquisition was publicly announced, Millul sold his Valspar stock and options for approximately 
$106,806 in profits, Berman said. 
Oujaddou, a Manhattan hairstylist and salon owner who has known Pinto-Thomaz for years and is a close friend 
with his mother, was given inside information during a haircut on March 8 or 9, 2016, according to case records. 
On March 10 through March 18, 2016, Oujaddou, who had never previously purchased Valspar or Sherwin-
Williams purchased 8,630 shares of Valspar stock, case records show. 
After the acquisition was publicly announced, Oujaddou sold his Valspar shares for approximately $192,080 in 
profits, according to case records. 
Following the trading, Oujaddou met Pinto-Thomaz in the paint aisle of a hardware store and paid him a 
kickback, Berman said. 
Pinto-Thomaz denied having a relationship with anyone on the list of pre-merger trading. 
EFTA00018457
--- PAGE 18 ---
In addition to his prison term, Pinto-Thomaz was sentenced to three years of supervised release and ordered to 
pay a fine of $15,000 and a forfeiture money judgment in the amount of $7,500. 
Millul and Oujaddou each previously pled guilty and were to be sentenced on July 30. 
Narcotics 
Castro 
Drug Dealer Forfeits Over $4M in Bitcoin as Part of a Guilty Plea 
All Stocks 
By Ravi Rd 
7/31/19 
According to a July 25 press release from the United States Attorney's Office of the Southern District of New 
York, the very active Bitcoin drug dealer Richard Castro has pleaded guilty of committing illicit activities such 
as money laundering and distributing three controlled substances through the dark web and encrypted emails. 
Castro was charged by the US Department of Justice (DoJ) and agreed to forfeit more than $4 million including 
cryptocurrency funds available in his seven different Bitcoin wallets. 
Castro, 36-year-old based in Windermere, Florida, operated under multiple badges, such as "Chems_usa," 
"Chemical_usa" and "Jagger109" to distribute three controlled opioid substances namely carfentanil, fentanyl, 
and phenyl fentanyl. Dream Market and AlphaBay were two of his primary market places on the dark web, 
where he sold drugs in exchange for cryptocurrency. 
The three controlled opioid substances were sold from November 2015 to 2019 by Castro and another co-
conspirator, Luis Fernandez. Fentanyl, the first of these three is considered to be significantly stronger than 
heroin while Carfentanil is believed to be 100 times stronger than fentanyl. Castro sold these substances under 
the three aforementioned monikers which ultimately used to prove that he is indeed the leader of this conspiracy. 
On Dream Market, Castro once boasted about 3,200 transactions that he had completed on various dark web 
marketplaces. Out of these 3,200 transactions, 1,800 transactions were successfully completed on AlphaBay 
alone. The conspirators apparently also received many positive reviews for the quality of synthetic opioid 
substance they were selling. 
In June 218, Castro informed his clients that he would only accept orders received by encrypted emails and 
declared the organization is getting the business off from the dark web. Customers who wanted to buy narcotics 
had to acquire the address of the encrypted email from "Chems_usa" by paying certain fees. Unfortunately for 
Castro, an undercover law enforcement officer also obtained the encrypted email and placed an order, which 
ultimately led to his arrest. 
Castro was accepting the payments in Bitcoin which were later distributed in seven different BTC wallets. 
Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said: 
"As he admitted today, for years, Richard Castro used the dark web to distribute prolific quantities of powerful 
opioids, including fentanyl and carfentanil. Castro thought he could hide behind the anonymity of the interne, 
and use online pseudonyms to deal drugs — like `Chems_usa' and `Chemical_usa.' Thanks to our law 
enforcement partners, `Chems_usa' is now in U.S. prison." 
Castro has agreed to forfeit $4,156,198.18 including the funds on those seven Bitcoin wallets.

Rochester Drug Company 
Distributor Has Been Shipping Excess Opioids to Small Towns 
Legal Reader 
By Sara E. Teller 
7/31/19 
Miami-Luken Inc., an Ohio drug wholesale distributor, and four people including two former executives have 
been charged with selling millions of pills amid the opioid epidemic despite knowing the dangers. The 
indictment charged the Springboro, Ohio-based company; Anthony Rattini, the company's former president; 
James Barlay, former compliance officer, and two pharmacists with "conspiring to distribute controlled 
substances." Prosecutors have alleged "Miami-Luken ignored obvious signs that drugs were being diverted to 
illegal users and dealers between 2011 and 2015." The company was shipping 4.9 million pills to Miller-West's 
drugstore in Oceana, W.Va., where the population is just under 1,400. 
"Miami-Luken and the executives failed to guard against the dangerous drugs it was shipping to pharmacies in 
five states from being diverted for illegal uses or to report suspicious orders to the U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration," they added. 
The distributor shipped millions of pills to desolate and rural areas of Appalachia which was hit especially hard 
by the epidemic. "Records show Miami-Luken also distributed 3.7 million hydrocodone pills from 2008 to 2011 
to a pharmacy in Kermit, West Virginia, a town of just 400 people," prosecutors said. The pharmacists charged 
were Devonna Miller-West, the owner of Oceana, West Virginia's Westside Pharmacy, and Samuel Ballengee, 
owner of Williamson, West Virginia's Tug Valley Pharmacy. 
The company was also shipping some to other "unnamed pharmacists and physicians," the indictment alleged. 
"There's a need, in my opinion, to devote sufficient charges right here and now to stop the dying," United States 
Attorney Benjamin C. Glassman said, adding investigators found "many overdose deaths that could arguably be 
linked to the conduct of people accused in the conspiracy." 
In April of this year, criminal charges were brought against Rochester Drug Co-operative. Geoffrey S. Berman, 
the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and Ray Donovan, the Special Agent in 
Charge of the New York Division of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), announced the charges. 
Rochester Drug Co-Operative is one of the 10 largest pharmaceutical distributors in the United States. Charges 
were also filed against Laurence F. Doud III, the company's former chief executive officer; and William 
Pietruszewski, the company's former chief compliance officer. The indictment was specifically for "unlawfully 
distributing oxycodone and fentanyl, and conspiring to defraud the DEA," according to court documents. 
Berman said at the time, "This prosecution is the first of its kind: executives of a pharmaceutical distributor and 
the distributor itself have been charged with drug trafficking, trafficking the same drugs that are fueling the 
opioid epidemic that is ravaging this country. Our Office will do everything in its power to combat this 
epidemic, from street-level dealers to the executives who illegally distribute drugs from their boardrooms." The 
company paid $20 million to resolve the charges. 
DEA Special Agent in Charge Ray Donovan said, "Today's charges should send shock waves throughout the 
pharmaceutical industry reminding them of their role as gatekeepers of prescription medication. The distribution 
of life-saving medication is paramount to public health; similarly, so is identifying rogue members of the 
pharmaceutical and medical fields whose diversion contributes to the record-breaking drug overdoses in 
America. DEA investigates DEA Registrants who divert controlled pharmaceutical medication into the wrong 
hands for the wrong reason. This historic investigation unveiled a criminal element of denial in RDC's 
compliance practices and holds them accountable for their egregious non-compliance according to the law."

Civil 
Life Spine 
Lawsuit against Huntley-based medical device company alleges kickback scheme 
Northwest Herald 
By Drew Zimmerman 
7/30/19 
Life Spine, a medical technology manufacturer in Huntley, is the defendant in a federal lawsuit alleging 
violations of the False Claims Act by offering lucrative incentives to surgeons in exchange for their use of Life 
Spine products. 
The suit, which was filed last week by the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Southern District of New York, alleges 
that the company entered into agreements with dozens of surgeons as a means to pay more than $7 million in 
illegal kickbacks — including consulting fees, royalties and intellectual acquisition payments - for the surgeon's 
use of Life Spine's equipment. 
The suit also alleges that these agreements, spanning an estimated seven-year period, were done with the 
knowledge, involvement and participation of Life Spine President and CEO Michael Butler and Vice President 
of Business Development Richard Greiber, who also are being charged. 
"Defendants are liable for damages based on the payment of claims submitted to Medicare and Medicaid for 
medical services and procedures involving Life Spine Products that were tainted by illegal kickbacks," the suit 
reads. 
About half of Life Spine's total domestic sales of spinal products between January 2012 and at least December 
2018, were attributable to surgeries performed by these paid surgeons, according to the suit. 
In addition to the consulting fees and royalties being paid, surgeons also were treated to dinners at high-end 
restaurants, Chicago Cubs games and other perks. 
"As alleged, Life Spine and its senior management flagrantly ignored the law by paying surgeons millions of 
dollars in fees and royalties to get them to use Life Spine products during spinal surgeries," Manhattan U.S. 
Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said in a release. "Kickbacks to doctors can alter or compromise their judgment 
about the medical care and services to provide to patients, and can increase healthcare costs." 
For the first two counts of violating the False Claims Act — which are against Life Spine, Butler and Greiber —
the plaintiff is seeking treble damages and civil penalties to the maximum amount allowed by state law. 
For the third count of unjust enrichment — which is only against Life Spine — the plaintiff is seeking damages to 
the extent allowed by law. 
The plaintiff also is seeking pre- and post-judgment interest, costs and any other relief the court deems 
appropriate. 
A statement from Life Spine said that both parties are engaged in discussions and look forward to resolving the 
matter.

Matters of Interest 
The U.S. said a California cherry-picker went to Pakistan for terrorist training. Now the case has 
collapsed. 
Washington Post 
By Meagan Flynn 
7/31/19 
It was a month after 9/11, and Osama bin Laden's face flashed across the news on Naseem Khan's TV screen. 
The FBI was sitting in his living room in Bend, Ore., and Khan sensed an opportunity. The agents had come for 
an entirely different purpose and were ready to leave — until Khan pointed at the screen and said he thought he 
could help with something else. A few years ago, he said, he saw bin Laden's second-in-command, Ayman al-
Zawahiri, one of the most wanted terrorists in the world, at a mosque in the wine-country town of Lodi, Calif. 
The agents perked up, intrigued by the possibility. Had they really just stumbled into a hot tip on al-Qaeda while 
speaking to a 28-year-old McDonald's worker and convenience store clerk? The FBI thought Khan was onto 
something — a possible "sleeper cell" of terrorism hidden in Lodi — and decided to dispatch him there as a 
confidential informant. 
Khan wouldn't find any associates of Zawahiri at the mosque in Lodi, and U.S. officials and terrorism experts 
now doubt his initial claim about Zawahiri was ever true. But Khan would find 19-year-old Hamid Hayat — who 
would soon become the face of homegrown terrorism in post-9/11 America. 
They met at the mosque, and Khan learned Hayat was taking a trip to Pakistan with family. Over and over, in 
recorded conversations, he returned to the same question: Would Hayat commit to attending a terrorist training 
camp, as he had promised? 
Now, a judge's order on Tuesday casts doubt on whether Hayat ever actually did. 
Hayat, a cherry-picker and son of an ice cream truck driver, was convicted of attending the alleged terrorist 
training camp and sentenced to 24 years in prison in 2006. Prosecutors, relying on Khan and Hayat's own 
statements, alleged that he attended the camp for three to six months sometime in 2003. The case would become 
one of the most high-profile examples of the government's fight against terrorism in the immediate aftermath of 
9/11, especially because Hayat, after hours of interrogation by FBI agents, confessed to attending the camp. 
But on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Garland E. Burrell Jr. vacated his conviction and sentence, finding that 
Hayat had inadequate defense during the 2006 trial while casting doubt on the facts of the case. Burrell 
questioned whether jurors would have convicted him had they heard evidence from witnesses in Pakistan, which 
the judge said likely would have "undermined" jurors' confidence in Hayat's confession alone. His attorneys 
have maintained the confession was coerced during an exhausting interrogation. 
Had the defense attorney actually interviewed any witnesses in Pakistan who spent significant time with Hayat 
during his trip, she would have discovered that they recalled Hayat spent most of his time playing video games 
and cricket and that the purpose of his visit was for his family to find him a wife, according to Burrell's order. 
No one identified any prolonged disappearance that would have allowed him to visit a terrorist training camp for 
three to six months as prosecutors alleged and Hayat said in the confession, Burrell noted. Burrell, who oversaw 
Hayat's original trial, found the witnesses gave consistent statements and could have provided Hayat a credible 
alibi. 
"Showing that Hayat could not have been at a jihadi training camp for the `period of months' specified in the 
indictment would have been completely consistent with the defense that Hayat's confession should not be 
EFTA00018461
--- PAGE 22 ---
credited and the government lacked other supporting evidence," a U.S. magistrate wrote in making the 
recommendation that Hayat's conviction be vacated. Burrell adopted most of the magistrate's findings of fact. 
The government has not decided yet whether to appeal the decision, a spokeswoman in the U.S. attorney's office 
in the Eastern District of California said in a statement, the Sacramento Bee reported. "We are in the process of 
reviewing the district court decision and assessing what steps, if any, should be taken and considering all our 
options," the statement said. 
Hayat, now 36, is currently being held in a federal prison in Phoenix. His attorneys are seeking his immediate 
release. 
The case against Hayat and his father, Umer, who was accused of lying to the FBI, heaped international attention 
on the Northern California town of Lodi. Seemingly overnight, the town went from the zinfandel capital of the 
world to an alleged terrorism "sleeper cell" — a claim authorities would later walk back. 
At the time he met Khan in August 2002, Hayat lived in his parents' garage and didn't have many friends, as the 
Intercept recounted in a 2016 investigation. Posing as a radical Islamist, Khan nudged Hayat into conversations 
that were anti-American and supportive of Islamic fundamentalist groups, and to his delight Hayat went along 
with it, according to recorded conversations cited in federal court documents. Hayat approved of the beheading 
of Wall Street Journal journalist Daniel Pearl by Pakistani militants. He told Khan he believed jihadists had 
attended his grandfather's religious school in Pakistan and claimed his grandfather was so politically well 
connected that the Pakistani president enlisted him in efforts to persuade the Taliban to turn over bin Laden after 
9/11. 
Then came the terrorist camps. Hayat said he had seen one in an online video — and expressed interest in going 
himself. Khan, feeding the intel to the FBI, egged him on. 
But once in Pakistan, Hayat kept making excuses, according to the judge's order. When Khan told him he was 
being "lazy," Hayat claimed the climate had changed and it got too hot outside — the terrorist camp was 
canceled, he said. Khan was starting to get mad. His nudges turned to threats. 
"God willing, when I come to Pakistan and I see you, I'm going to ... force you to, get you from your throat and 
... throw you in the madrassa," Khan said in one expletive-laden recorded conversation, as the Intercept reported. 
"I'm not going to go with that," Hayat said. 
"Oh yeah, you will go," Khan told him. "Yeah, you will go. You know what? Maybe I can't fight with you in 
America, but I can beat your a-- in Pakistan, so nobody's going to come to your rescue." 
In their last conversation, according to the Intercept, which obtained all the recordings, Hayat said he "never 
intended on going to a camp." 
Hayat denied attending a camp in his first interview with the FBI in Japan, before flying to San Francisco. He 
confessed during his second interview in California upon his return in June 2005. 
"FBI: Al Qaeda plot possibly uncovered," rang a CNN headline in June 2005, saying those involved "Trained on 
how to kill Americans." 
Months after Hayat's arrest, then-director of national intelligence, John D. Negroponte, testified in a 
congressional hearing that a "network of Islamic extremists in Lodi, Calif., for example, maintained connections 
with Pakistani militant groups, recruited United States citizens." 
But ultimately, no other terrorism cases arose from the investigation except for the one against Hayat. Two 
imams were investigated but were never criminally charged with anything. They had overstayed religious worker 
EFTA00018462

visas, authorities discovered. 
A retired FBI agent who watched Hayat's interrogation and the resulting confession told the Los Angeles Times 
it was "the sorriest interrogation, the sorriest confession, I've ever seen," believing the agents fed Hayat the 
details they wanted to hear and that Hayat repeated them so he could leave. He was barred from offering his 
testimony at trial. Burrell found that the failure to challenge the validity of the confession by presenting a false 
confession expert also contributed to his finding that Hayat had ineffective counsel. 
Khan was ultimately paid nearly $230,000 for assisting the FBI over three years. During Hayat's trial, his 
defense attorney questioned how one fast-food worker's implausible claim that he saw the world's most wanted 
terrorist in a small-town mosque could have "sparked this whole investigation with this ridiculous claim," the 
Times reported in 2006. 
Hayat's attorneys filed an appeal in 2014 and ultimately sought to interview numerous witnesses in Pakistan who 
could account for his whereabouts during the trip from 2003 to 2005. They appeared for sworn depositions on 
video in 2018. When Hayat's attorney, Dennis Riordan, asked his uncle whether he "would have known" if 
Hayat disappeared from their rural hamlet, Muhammad Anas said, "Naturally, I would have noticed," the 
Marshall Project reported then. 
The judge found that the witnesses "corroborated each other on some important points," regarding trips the 
family took throughout Pakistan and who they visited. Once or twice a month, they traveled to a hospital for his 
mother's medical treatment. 
On Tuesday, Hayat's family issued a statement applauding the judge's decision to throw out Hayat's conviction, 
the Sacramento Bee reported. 
"We have been waiting 14 long years for Hamid to be freed," the statement read. "Hamid cannot get those 14 
years of his life back, but we are relieved to see the case take such a big step forward. We miss him and hope to 
be reunited with him soon." 
Fed Cuts Interest Rates for First Time Since 2008 Crisis 
New York Times 
By Jeanna Smialek 
7/31/19 
The Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the first time in more than a decade on Wednesday as it attempted to 
guard the record-long economic expansion against mounting global risks. 
The widely expected quarter-point move, the Fed's first since it cut rates to near zero in 2008, is meant to protect 
the economy against the potentially harmful effects of a growth slowdown in China and Europe and uncertainty 
from President Trump's trade war. 
"In light of the implications of global developments for the economic outlook as well as muted inflation 
pressures, the committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate," according to the Federal 
Open Market Committee's policy statement. 
But the Fed did not indicate that this was the beginning of a rate-cutting campaign, suggesting instead that the 
cut was a minor adjustment intended to help the economy weather any challenges from slowing global growth 
and Mr. Trump's trade fights.

Catch up and prep for the week ahead with this newsletter of the most important business insights, delivered 
Sundays. 
While Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, left the door open to additional rate moves if the economy showed signs 
of sputtering, he did not indicate the central bank was poised to engage in the sort of deep cutting cycle that the 
Fed has done in the past to avert or offset recessions. 
"It's not the beginning of a long series of rate cuts - I didn't say it's just one," Mr. Powell said at a news 
conference following the Fed's two-day policy meeting. "What we're seeing is that it's appropriate to adjust 
policy to a somewhat more accommodative stance over time, and that's how we're looking at it." 
The widely expected move from the central bank was initially greeted with a shrug in financial markets, where 
investors have been factoring in a rate cut for months. But the stock market turned lower after Mr. Powell began 
his news conference at 2:30 p.m., as investors absorbed the chair's comments as indicating the Fed was unlikely 
to make additional cuts anytime soon, as investors had hoped. 
By the end of the day, the S&P 500 was down 1.1 percent. It was the benchmark index's worst decline since May 
31. 
The Fed dropped its target rate to a range between 2 percent to 2.25 percent. Officials also announced an early 
end to its efforts to shrink the Fed's balance sheet, another attempt to keep the economy moving. The central 
bank's holdings of government-backed bonds swelled during the financial crisis as it bought assets to try to 
reinvigorate growth. Policymakers have been slowly siphoning off securities to return their balance sheet to a 
more normal size, and that process was slated to end in September. It will now conclude Aug. 1. 
Why the Federal Reserve Cut Interest Rates 
The move is what's called an "insurance cut" — one that central bankers are making to keep growth chugging 
along. 
Both Eric Rosengren, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, and Esther George, the president of 
the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, voted against Wednesday's decision, preferring instead to leave rates 
unchanged. Those dissents marked the second and third of Jerome H. Powell's term as chair. 
While Fed officials said they expect economic expansion to continue and the labor market to remain strong 
"uncertainties about this outlook remain." 
Mr. Powell said the Fed's move was "intended to insure against downside risks from weak global growth and 
trade tensions." 
He said that manufacturing around the world was weakening and that Mr. Trump's trade dispute was continuing 
to spook American businesses. "The ongoing uncertainty is making some companies more cautious about their 
capital spending," he said. 
Officials did not indicate in their statement whether this cut would be followed by additional moves. The Fed's 
June economic projections suggest policymakers envision cutting rates slightly to shore up the economy, rather 
than beginning an easing cycle that will return rates to zero. 
"As the committee contemplates the future path of the target range for the federal funds rate, it will continue to 
monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain 
the expansion," the Fed said in its statement, seemingly leaving its options open. 
Mr. Powell said the committee viewed the move as a "mid-cycle adjustment to policy," suggesting that the Fed 
sees this cut as more similar to two instances in the 1990s, during which the Fed moved rates down slightly to 
get the economy through periods of uncertainty, rather than the beginning of a rate-cutting campaign. 
EFTA00018464

The Fed's rate cut carries political risks, given Mr. Trump's attacks on the central bank. Mr. Trump has been 
denouncing the Fed in speeches and on Twitter for the past year, criticizing its four 2018 rate increases and 
blaming its policies for slowing the American economy. Some onlookers may see Wednesday's move as caving 
to the president. 
The Fed operates independently of the White House. It attributed the change, which officials have been signaling 
for months and which investors fully expected, to growing economic concerns. 
"We also don't conduct monetary policy to prove our independence," Mr. Powell said. 
The central bank is trying to extend a record-long economic expansion, because officials believe that doing so 
will allow the Fed to achieve its goals of maximum employment and slow but steady inflation. The 
unemployment rate is hovering around its lowest level in 50 years, but that has yet to push wages dramatically 
higher in a way that forces companies to lift prices more quickly. 
Inflation has run shy of the Fed's 2 percent goal since the central bank formally adopted it in 2012. A little 
inflation helps to grease the wheels of a healthy economy, allowing businesses to raise wages faster and lifting 
interest rates, giving the central bank more room to cut in the event of a downturn. 
Prices picked up just 1.6 percent in the year through June, not counting volatile food and fuel costs. 
Wages are growing only moderately. An index of employment costs climbed by 2.7 percent in the second quarter 
from a year earlier, less than expected and a slowdown from earlier in 2019, according to data released on 
Wednesday. 
Global policy uncertainty has also increased, and manufacturing is slumping the world over. Growth is slowing 
in China and Europe, and Mr. Trump's trade war with China and threats of further tariffs on United States trading 
partners are stoking uncertainty and causing businesses to hold off on investment. 
Those developments threaten the economic outlook, even as growth remains solid, consumer spending is robust 
and the job market holds up for now.

Jeffrey Epstein Hoped to Seed Human Race With His DNA 
New York Times 
By James B. Stewart, Matthew Goldstein and Jessica Silver-Greenberg 
7/31/19 
Jeffrey E. Epstein, the wealthy financier who is accused of sex trafficking, had an unusual dream: He hoped to 
seed the human race with his DNA by impregnating women at his vast New Mexico ranch. 
Mr. Epstein over the years confided to scientists and others about his scheme, according to four people familiar 
with his thinking, although there is no evidence that it ever came to fruition. 
Mr. Epstein's vision reflected his longstanding fascination with what has become known as transhumanism: the 
science of improving the human population through technologies like genetic engineering and artificial 
intelligence. Critics have likened transhumanism to a modern-day version of eugenics, the discredited field of 
improving the human race through controlled breeding. 
Mr. Epstein, who was charged in July with the sexual trafficking of girls as young as 14, was a serial illusionist: 
He lied about the identities of his clients, his wealth, his financial prowess, his personal achievements. But he 
managed to use connections and charisma to cultivate valuable relationships with business and political leaders. 
Interviews with more than a dozen of his acquaintances, as well as public documents, show that he used the 
same tactics to insinuate himself into an elite scientific community, thus allowing him to pursue his interests in 
eugenics and other fringe fields like cryonics. 
Lawyers for Mr. Epstein, who has pleaded not guilty to the sex-trafficking charges, did not respond to requests 
for comment. 
Mr. Epstein attracted a glittering array of prominent scientists. They included the Nobel Prize-winning physicist 
Murray Gell-Mann, who discovered the quark; the theoretical physicist and best-selling author Stephen 
Hawking; the paleontologist and evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould; Oliver Sacks, the neurologist and 
best-selling author; George M. Church, a molecular engineer who has worked to identify genes that could be 
altered to create superior humans; and the M.I.T. theoretical physicist Frank Wilczek, a Nobel laureate. 
The lure for some of the scientists was Mr. Epstein's money. He dangled financing for their pet projects. Some 
of the scientists said that the prospect of financing blinded them to the seriousness of his sexual transgressions, 
and even led them to give credence to some of Mr. Epstein's half-baked scientific musings. 
Scientists gathered at dinner parties at Mr. Epstein's Manhattan mansion, where Dom Perignon and expensive 
wines flowed freely, even though Mr. Epstein did not drink. He hosted buffet lunches at Harvard's Program for 
Evolutionary Dynamics, which he had helped start with a $6.5 million donation.

Others flew to conferences sponsored by Mr. Epstein in the United States Virgin Islands and were feted on his 
private island there. Once, the scientists — including Mr. Hawking — crowded on board a submarine that Mr. 
Epstein had chartered. 
The Harvard cognitive psychologist Steven Pinker said he was invited by colleagues — including Martin 
Nowak, a Harvard professor of mathematics and biology, and the theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss — to 
"salons and coffee klatsches" at which Mr. Epstein would hold court. 
While some of Mr. Pinker's peers hailed Mr. Epstein as brilliant, Mr. Pinker described him as an "intellectual 
impostor." 
"He would abruptly change the subject, A.D.D.-style, dismiss an observation with an adolescent wisecrack," 
Mr. Pinker said. 
Another scientist cultivated by Mr. Epstein, Jaron Lanier, a prolific author who is a founding father of virtual 
reality, said that Mr. Epstein's ideas did not amount to science, in that they did not lend themselves to rigorous 
proof. Mr. Lanier said Mr. Epstein had once hypothesized that atoms behaved like investors in a marketplace. 
Mr. Lanier said he had declined any funding from Mr. Epstein and that he had met with him only once after Mr. 
Epstein in 2008 pleaded guilty to charges of soliciting prostitution from a minor. 
Mr. Epstein was willing to finance research that others viewed as bizarre. He told one scientist that he was 
bankrolling efforts to identify a mysterious particle that might trigger the feeling that someone is watching you. 
At one session at Harvard, Mr. Epstein criticized efforts to reduce starvation and provide health care to the poor 
because doing so increased the risk of overpopulation, said Mr. Pinker, who was there. Mr. Pinker said he had 
rebutted the argument, citing research showing that high rates of infant mortality simply caused people to have 
more children. Mr. Epstein seemed annoyed, and a Harvard colleague later told Mr. Pinker that he had been 
"voted off the island" and was no longer welcome at Mr. Epstein's gatherings. 
Then there was Mr. Epstein's interest in eugenics. 
On multiple occasions starting in the early 2000s, Mr. Epstein told scientists and businessmen about his 
ambitions to use his New Mexico ranch as a base where women would be inseminated with his sperm and 
would give birth to his babies, according to two award-winning scientists and an adviser to large companies and 
wealthy individuals, all of whom Mr. Epstein told about it. 
It was not a secret. The adviser, for example, said he was told about the plans not only by Mr. Epstein, at a 
gathering at his Manhattan townhouse, but also by at least one prominent member of the business community. 
One of the scientists said Mr. Epstein divulged his idea in 2001 at a dinner at the same townhouse; the other 
recalled Mr. Epstein discussing it with him at a 2006 conference that he hosted in St. Thomas in the Virgin 
Islands. 
The idea struck all three as far-fetched and disturbing. There is no indication that it would have been against the 
law. 
Once, at a dinner at Mr. Epstein's mansion on Manhattan's Upper East Side, Mr. Lanier said he talked to a 
scientist who told him that Mr. Epstein's goal was to have 20 women at a time impregnated at his 33,000-
EFTA00018468

square-foot Zorro Ranch in a tiny town outside Santa Fe. Mr. Lanier said the scientist identified herself as 
working at NASA, but he did not remember her name. 
According to Mr. Lanier, the NASA scientist said Mr. Epstein had based his idea for a baby ranch on accounts 
of the Repository for Germinal Choice, which was to be stocked with the sperm of Nobel laureates who wanted 
to strengthen the human gene pool. (Only one Nobel Prize winner has acknowledged contributing sperm to it. 
The repository discontinued operations in 1999.) 
Mr. Lanier, the virtual-reality creator and author, said he had the impression that Mr. Epstein was using the 
dinner parties — where some guests were attractive women with impressive academic credentials — to screen 
candidates to bear Mr. Epstein's children. 
Mr. Epstein did not hide his interest in tinkering with genes — and in perpetuating his own DNA. 
One adherent of transhumanism said that he and Mr. Epstein discussed the financier's interest in cryonics, an 
unproven science in which people's bodies are frozen to be brought back to life in the future. Mr. Epstein told 
this person that he wanted his head and penis to be frozen. 
Southern Trust Company, Mr. Epstein's Virgin Island-incorporated business, disclosed in a local filing that it 
was engaged in DNA analysis. Calls to Southern Trust, which sponsored a science and math fair for school 
children in the Virgin Islands in 2014, were not returned. 
In 2011, a charity established by Mr. Epstein gave $20,000 to the Worldwide Transhumanist Association, which 
now operates under the name Humanity Plus. The group's website says that its goal is "to deeply influence a 
new generation of thinkers who dare to envision humanity's next steps." 
Mr. Epstein's foundation, which is now defunct, also gave $100,000 to pay the salary of Ben Goertzel, vice 
chairman of Humanity Plus, according to Mr. Goertzel's résumé. 
"I have no desire to talk about Epstein right now," Mr. Goertzel said in an email to The New York Times. "The 
stuff I'm reading about him in the papers is pretty disturbing and goes way beyond what I thought his misdoings 
and kinks were. Yecch." 
Alan M. Dershowitz, a professor emeritus of law at Harvard, recalled that at a lunch Mr. Epstein hosted in 
Cambridge, Mass., he steered the conversation toward the question of how humans could be improved 
genetically. Mr. Dershowitz said he was appalled, given the Nazis' use of eugenics to justify their genocidal 
effort to purify the Aryan race. 
Yet the lunches persisted. 
"Everyone speculated about whether these scientists were more interested in his views or more interested in his 
money," said Mr. Dershowitz, who was one of Mr. Epstein's defense lawyers in the 2008 case. 
Luminaries at Mr. Epstein's St. Thomas conference in 2006 included Mr. Hawking and the Caltech theoretical 
physicist Kip S. Thorne. One participant at that conference, which was ostensibly on the subject of gravity, 
recalled that Mr. Epstein wanted to talk about perfecting the human genome. Mr. Epstein said he was fascinated 
with how certain traits were passed on, and how that could result in superior humans. 
EFTA00018469

Mr. Epstein appears to have gained entree into the scientific community through John Brockman, a literary 
agent whose best-selling science writers include Richard Dawkins, Daniel Goleman and Jared Diamond. Mr. 
Brockman did not respond to requests for comment. 
For two decades, Mr. Brockman presided over a series of salons that matched his scientist-authors with 
potential benefactors. (The so-called "billionaires' dinners" apparently became a model for the gatherings at Mr. 
Epstein's East 71st Street townhouse, which included some of the same guests.) 
In 2004, Mr. Brockman hosted a dinner at the Indian Summer restaurant in Monterey, Calif, where Mr. Epstein 
was introduced to scientists, including Seth Lloyd, the M.I.T. physicist. Mr. Lloyd said that he found Mr. 
Epstein to be "charming" and to have "interesting ideas," although they "turned out to be quite vague." 
Also at the Indian Summer dinner, according to an account on the website of Mr. Brockman's Edge Foundation, 
were the Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page and Jeff Bezos, who was accompanied by his mother. 
"All the good-looking women were sitting with the physicists' table," Daniel Dubno, who was a CBS producer 
at the time and attended the dinner, was quoted as saying. Mr. Dubno told The Times that he did not recall the 
dinner or having said those words. 
Mr. Brockman was Mr. Gell-Mann's agent, and Mr. Gell-Mann, in the acknowledgments section of his 1995 
book "The Quark and the Jaguar," thanked Mr. Epstein for his financial support. 
However impressive his roster of scientific contacts, Mr. Epstein could not resist embellishing it. He claimed on 
one of his websites to have had "the privilege of sponsoring many prominent scientists," including Mr. Pinker, 
Mr. Thome and the M.I.T. mathematician and geneticist Eric S. Lander. 
Mr. Pinker said he had never taken any financial or other support from Mr. Epstein. "Needless to say, I find 
Epstein's behavior reprehensible," he said. 
Mr. Thome, who recently won a Nobel Prize, said he attended Mr. Epstein's 2006 conference, believing it to be 
co-sponsored by a reputable research center. Other than that, "I have had no contact with, relationship with, 
affiliation with or funding from Epstein," he said. "I unequivocally condemn his abhorrent actions involving 
minors." 
Lee McGuire, a spokesman for Mr. Lander, said he has had no relationship with Mr. Epstein. "Mr. Epstein 
appears to have made up lots of things," Mr. McGuire said, "and this seems to be among them."

Some of Jeffrey Epstein's victims don't want new charges in South Florida 
South Florida Sun Sentinel 
By Marc Freeman 
7/30/19 
Financier Jeffrey Epstein has been branded a pervert and an abuser, but not all of his victims want to see him 
prosecuted further in South Florida. 
Some of the girls Epstein assaulted at his Palm Beach mansion before 2008 have already reached financial 
settlements with him and fear they'll lose their anonymity. Federal prosecutors — the ones who approved his 
lenient plea deal to begin with — say they fully support that position. 
Epstein faces separate federal sex trafficking charges in New York, but the debate about prosecuting him in 
South Florida will be resolved soon enough. A federal judge in West Palm Beach is considering whether to 
strike down parts of a controversial 2007 deal that gave him and unnamed co-conspirators immunity from 
federal charges. 
U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra ruled in February that Epstein's non-prosecution agreement violated the 
federal Crime Victims' Rights Act. Dozens of victims were improperly kept in the dark about it until after it had 
been finalized. 
Marra must decide how to rectify this violation 12 years later, after receiving arguments from lawyers for two 
of Epstein's victims, prosecutors and Epstein. 
The victims in the case, cited as Jane Does, say the necessary remedy is for Epstein to face what they say are 
long overdue charges in Florida. 
"To be sure, Jane Doe 1 and 2 very much appreciate the laudable efforts of the diligent prosecutors in New 
York," their lawyers wrote. "But those New York charges, important though they are, still leave Epstein's 
crimes in Florida uncharged and all of his co-conspirators at large." 
Lawyers for the U.S. government disagree. 
They concede that prosecutors back then "fell short" of treating victims properly as they reached a settlement 
with Epstein. But the attorneys now contend "the past cannot be undone" and the deal must be upheld under the 
law. 
Among their arguments is that many victims clearly want to let it go, because they are content with financial 
settlements they obtained from Epstein, and his 2008 guilty plea to two state prostitution charges. That plea 
resulted in 13 months in Palm Beach County Jail and registering as a sex offender. 
The prosecutors say they reached this position based on "conversations" with the victims and their lawyers, 
without giving a specific number. 
Attorney Spencer Kuvin of West Palm Beach said he represents one victim who met with the U.S. Attorney's 
Office in April. 
EFTA00018471
--- PAGE 7 ---
SDNY News Clips, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 
"She said she'd like to see him prosecuted and put in jail," Kuvin said. "She said, `I don't know if that's a 
realistic possibility, but that's what I want.'" 
He said it's not surprising that other victims are less inclined to participate. 
"When you have so many victims, you're going to have just as many different opinions as to how it should be 
handled," Kuvin said. "But that shouldn't stop the prosecution of a predator. One victim that wants to come 
forward ... is enough to put him away." 
The federal prosecutors explained that while some victims "would like to see Epstein prosecuted for his crimes, 
they valued anonymity above all and were not willing to speak with law enforcement or otherwise participate in 
any criminal or civil litigation due to the risk that their involvement may become known to family, friends, or 
the public." 
This is not to say there aren't many victims who are eager to see Epstein face new charges in South Florida, 
wrote Byung J. Pak, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia, and Jill E. Steinberg and Nathan P. 
Kitchens, special attorneys for the Southern District of Florida. 
But they conclude that reopening their cases against Epstein in South Florida still "exacerbates the harm to 
victims who have attempted to readjust their lives in the interim." 
Kuvin said he agrees, "It's a valid concern for some of the victims." 
Attorneys for two victims in the pending Crime Victims' Right Act litigation blasted the government's 
reasoning to leave Epstein's non-prosecution agreement in place. 
Lawyers Bradley Edwards, Paul Cassell and Jack Scarola say any South Florida victims who are not willing to 
prosecute Epstein because of privacy concerns can simply decline to do so and remain anonymous. 
The lawyers say there's no way that prosecuting Epstein for some victims would harm other victims unless the 
prosecutors somehow disclose their identities in the process. 
"The Government's argument thus boils down to a stop-us-before-we-do-something-bad claim that deserves no 
credence from the Court," wrote Edwards and his co-counsel on behalf of the two women, identified as Jane 
Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2. 
They also pointed out that the prosecutors weren't asserting the alleged "risk" to some victims outweighs 
obtaining justice for their clients. 
"But in any event, on closer examination, the Government's argument turns out to be vaporous," they wrote this 
month. 
Epstein's lawyers told the judge they support the South Florida prosecutors' arguments that the once-secret deal 
shouldn't be blown up to allow new charges. 
Jeffrey Epstein faces `a million pages' of evidence: defense lawyer

7/31/19 
Prosecutors have 1 million pages of evidence against Jeffrey Epstein, his lawyer revealed in court Monday —
without shedding any new light on the jailhouse incident that left the convicted pedophile with bruises on his 
neck. 
No marks were visible on Epstein's neck, and he never appeared to be in pain during the 15-minute hearing in 
Manhattan federal court. 
The judge overseeing the case tentatively scheduled Epstein's trial for June 2020 after a prosecutor said the 
child sex-trafficking charges against him should be resolved as "swiftly as possible." 
"We don't think any delay in this is in the public interest," Manhattan Assistant US Attorney 
said. 
Epstein's trial is expected to last four to six weeks, and the defense will have all the prosecution's evidence 
against the multimillionaire financier by Oct. 31, she said. 
Defense lawyer Martin Weinberg objected to starting the trial before September 2020, saying, "We need time to 
review a million pages of discovery." 
But Judge Richard Berman said he was blocking out time in June 2020 on the presumption that the defense 
would be ready by then. 
Weinberg didn't make any mention of the July 23 incident in which law enforcement sources have said Epstein, 
66, was found sprawled on the floor of his cell in the Metropolitan Correctional Center, where he's being held 
without bail. 
Weinberg declined to answer questions about the incident outside court. 
Epstein, who wore dark blue jail scrubs over a brown T-shirt, didn't speak during the hearing. 
He's pleaded not guilty to accusations he sexually abused dozens of underage girls - some as young as 14 —
in his Upper East Side townhouse and his waterfront mansion in Palm Beach, Florida, between 2002 and 2005. 
Berman set a Sept. 13 deadline for defense motions in the case, and Weinberg said he planned to seek dismissal 
of a conspiracy charge on grounds of double jeopardy tied to allegations that underpinned a non-prosecution 
agreement that Epstein struck in 2008 with then-Miami US Attorney Alex Acosta. 
That deal was exposed last year in an award-winning series of stories by the Miami Herald, and controversy that 
erupted following Epstein's July 6 arrest forced Acosta to resign as President Trump's labor secretary.

Jeffrey Epstein appears in court for first time since reported jail injuries 
The Guardian 
By Victoria Bekiempis 
7/31/19 
Financier Jeffrey Epstein looked physically healthy when he appeared in court in New York on Wednesday in 
his sex trafficking case, about a week after reportedly being found unconscious in his jail cell with neck injuries. 
He wore dark blue jail scrubs during his brief appearance in Manhattan federal criminal court on Wednesday 
morning, in a proceeding scheduled before the apparent incident behind bars last week. 
There were no signs of injuries that had been reported at the time and he appeared well and more neatly 
presented than at some previous hearings. 
The Jeffrey Epstein scandal 
His lawyers did not bring up the incident in court and refused to comment on the topic following the hearing, 
which focused on scheduling issues. 
Prosecutor 
asked for a June 2020 trial date to be set, telling the judge: "We don't think that any 
delay in this case is in the public interest." 
The Manhattan US attorney's office alleged earlier in July that Epstein "sexually exploited and abused dozens 
of minor girls" from 2002 to 2005. Some of his victims were just 14 years old, prosecutors alleged. 
The disgraced financier, who was arrested on 6 July, pleaded not guilty several weeks ago. 
Epstein has long been accused of sexually abusing underage girls. He also has purported connections to Donald 
Trump, Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew, and moved in elite circles, including for several years in a relationship 
with Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late British media tycoon Robert Maxwell. 
Epstein and the Miami US attorney's office, headed at the time by Alexander Acosta, brokered a plea deal in 
2008 that closed a federal inquiry involving at least 40 teenage girls. 
Under this arrangement, Epstein pleaded guilty to state charges, which presented far less potential jail time than 
if he had faced federal charges. The Miami Herald reporter Julie K Brown exposed the secretive nature of this 
agreement. Acosta resigned from his post as Trump's labor secretary following extensive criticism of the deal. 
Epstein has unsuccessfully requested bail while awaiting trial. The 66-year-old, who registered as a sex offender 
following the Florida case, had maintained through lawyers that he neither posed a danger nor risk of flight. 
In rejecting Epstein's request, Judge Richard Berman said, "the government has established danger to others 
and to the community by clear and convincing evidence", adding: "I doubt that any bail package can overcome 
a danger to the community."

Epstein's lawyers are appealing against the decision, according to court filings. 
Late last week, Judge Berman also ruled in favor of prosecutors' proposed protective order, which will keep 
case materials relating to "the government's ongoing investigation of uncharged individuals" under wraps.

Judge sets tentative date for Jeffrey Epstein's trial 
Associated Press 
By Larry Neumeister and Jim Mustian 
7/31/19 
A subdued Jeffrey Epstein listened passively in court Wednesday as a judge said he won't face trial on sex 
trafficking charges before June 2020, and more likely a few months afterward. 
There was no mention at the Manhattan federal court appearance or any visible sign of injuries after the 66-
year-old financier was found on the floor of his cell last week with neck bruises. 
Epstein's lawyer, Martin Weinberg, refused to say what might have left his client with neck bruises after the 
court hearing. 
Assistant U.S. Attorney 
urged a June trial date for the man accused of arranging to have sex with 
girls as young as age 14, saying there is "a public interest in bringing this case to trial as swiftly as possible." 
But Weinberg said the case is far from "ordinary," adding the defense team won't be ready before Labor Day 
2020. He said prosecutors delayed bringing charges that relate to alleged crimes that occurred in the early 2000s 
at Epstein's residences in Manhattan and Florida. 
U.S. District Judge Richard M. Berman said a trial projected to last four to six weeks could tentatively begin 
June 8, but he'll likely defer to defense lawyers' needs if they are not ready. 
Epstein's demeanor in court was noticeably different from previous appearances, when he was actively engaged 
with his lawyers and looking through papers. 
On Wednesday, he sat quietly, his hands folded in front of his face through much of the 20-minute proceeding. 
Occasionally, he looked toward courtroom artists and reporters seated in a jury box. 
Epstein has remained at the Metropolitan Correction Center, which is adjacent to the downtown Manhattan 
courthouse. 
He has pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking charges that carry the potential for up to 45 years in prison. 
Berman refused bail after concluding he is a danger to the community and a flight risk. Prosecutors have said 
they fear he might try to influence a growing number of witnesses who support charges that he recruited and 
abused dozens of girls in New York and Florida in the early 2000s. His lawyers had argued he should be 
allowed to stay under house arrest in his Manhattan mansion. 
His lawyers say an agreement reached with federal prosecutors a dozen years ago disallows the charges and 
they say he has committed no new crimes. 
EFTA00018476
--- PAGE 12 ---
SDNY News Clips, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 
The lawyers agreed to file written arguments about the agreement and double jeopardy claims by Sept. 13. Oral 
arguments will occur in October. 
The non-prosecution deal was reached before he pleaded guilty in state court in Florida to prostitution-related 
charges involving underage girls. Afterward, he was required to register as a sex offender and pay restitution to 
many victims. While he served a 13-month jail term, he was permitted to leave jail to work for 12 hours a day, 
six days a week. 
Epstein was arrested July 6 when he arrived at a New Jersey airport on a private jet from Paris, where he has a 
home.

Did Jeffrey Epstein try to kill himself? He and his lawyer, back in court, aren't saying 
Miami Herald 
By Miami Herald Staff 
7/31/19 
Victims of Jeffrey Epstein share the emotional toll that sexual abuse has taken on them — even years after the 
abuse occurred. Miami Herald reporter Julie K. Brown interviewed the young women, most speaking for the 
first time about Epstein. BY EMILY MICHOT I JULIE K. BROWN 
For the first time since he was found semi-conscious in his jail cell with telltale bruise marks on his neck, 
accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein appeared in a Manhattan court room. 
Epstein — onetime friend of the rich and powerful, including current President Donald Trump and past 
President Bill Clinton — learned Wednesday that he will not face trial until at least next June. 
The multimillionaire part-time resident of Palm Beach sat subdued in front of U.S. District Court Judge Richard 
M. Berman. The 66-year-old defendant wore dark blue jail scrubs and glasses. 
His lawyer, Martin Weinberg, declined to reveal any details about the incident at the Metropolitan Correctional 
Center, which occurred July 23, including whether it was a suicide attempt, an attack by a fellow detainee or 
something else. His client is being held without bond. 
Wednesday's hearing in New York City lasted just 15 minutes. 
Epstein, a financier who owns homes around the world, including a waterfront estate in Palm Beach, was 
arrested July 6, nearly eight months after the Miami Herald published Perversion of Justice, a two-year 
investigation of a much-reviled secret plea deal in 2007-2008 that spared Epstein a sweeping federal indictment 
despite allegations of sexual abuse by nearly three dozen underage girls. 
He had just arrived from France at New Jersey's Teterboro airport on his private jet when authorities met him 
and took him into custody. 
During the early- and mid-2000s, Epstein allegedly ran what amounted to a sexual pyramid scheme, using 
recruiters to lure girls as young as 14 to his lavish Palm Beach and Manhattan mansions with the promise that 
they would receive $200 to give a man a massage. The girls have alleged that they were coerced into sex. 
The girls were paid additional money if they would recruit others girls, police and court records allege. Epstein 
had assistants schedule as many as three visits a day. 
Rather than face federal charges that could have put him away for life, Epstein pleaded guilty in state court to 
minor prostitution charges and served just a year in the county stockade — which permitted him to leave the 
lockup for his luxurious downtown West Palm Beach office for 12 hours a day, six days a week. This "work 
release" arrangement, highly unusual for a sex offender, is now under criminal investigation by order of the 
Palm Beach sheriff, Ric Bradshaw, who oversees the stockade and approved the work release.

SDNY News Clips, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 
Although Assistant U.S. Attorney 
said it is important to move swiftly ahead with Epstein's court 
case, his defense attorney said he needs time in light of the approximately one million pages of documents that 
that comprise the evidence collected against his client. 
Labor Secretary Alex Acosta held a press conference to defend his role in handling the Jeffrey Epstein sexual 
abuse case. Acosta was a U.S. Attorney who approved the Epstein plea deal in 2008. By CSPAN 
In the meantime, Epstein will be given a chance to argue that the non-prosecution agreement, executed in 2008, 
gave him, his schedulers, his alleged madam and others immunity from federal charges and that the new 
charges constitute impermissible double jeopardy. 
In its series of articles, the Herald highlighted the role of Alexander Acosta, then-U.S. attorney for the Southern 
District of Florida, in approving the immunity agreement, including a controversial stipulation that Epstein's 
accusers not be told of the arrangement. Facing searing criticism after Epstein's arrest, Acosta resigned his post 
as President Trump's labor secretary.

Jeffrey Epstein could face sex trafficking trial next June 
Reuters 
7/31/19 
Financier Jeffrey Epstein could go to trial on charges of sex trafficking involving dozens of underage girls as 
early as next June, though his lawyers told a court on Wednesday they may need more time. 
At a hearing in Manhattan federal court, prosecutors sought a June 2020 trial date, while a lawyer for Epstein 
asked that it wait another three months. 
The lawyer, Martin Weinberg, said Epstein and his legal team needed more time to review evidence, expected 
to total more than 1 million pages. 
U.S. District Judge Richard Berman said he would tentatively set aside time for a trial beginning June 8, but 
revisit the issue later. He said he normally allowed defendants more time to prepare if they wished. 
Assistant U.S. Attorney 
said a trial is expected to last four to six weeks. 
Prosecutors have accused Epstein of arranging for girls under the age of 18 to perform nude "massages" and 
other sex acts, and of paying some girls to recruit others. Epstein has pleaded not guilty. 
Wednesday's hearing occurred one week after Epstein was reportedly found unconscious and with neck injuries 
in his jail cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in downtown Manhattan. 
Epstein, dressed in blue jail scrubs, had no visible injuries on Wednesday. His lawyers declined to comment on 
the reports after the hearing. 
Epstein is appealing Berman's July 18 denial of his request to remain under house arrest in his $77 million 
mansion on Manhattan's Upper East Side while awaiting trial. 
The charges against Epstein focus on alleged misconduct from at least 2002 to 2005. 
They followed Epstein's 2008 guilty plea to state prostitution charges in Florida, in exchange for the Justice 
Department's agreement not to prosecute him on similar charges. 
Epstein served 13 months in jail and agreed to register as a sex offender under the 2008 agreement, which is 
now widely considered too lenient. 
His lawyers have argued this month that the agreement barred federal prosecutors in Manhattan from pursuing 
the current case over the same conduct. Weinberg said at Wednesday's hearing that they intended to file 
motions on the issue. 
U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman, whose office is overseeing the current case, has said there is no such bar.

Epstein Lawyers Ask for a Year to Review a Million Pages 
Bloomberg 
By Chris Dolmetsch , Bob Van Voris , and Patricia Hurtado 
7/31/19 
Jeffrey Epstein's lawyers say they need at least a year to review a blizzard of documents prosecutors have 
gathered against the fund manager as they prepare to defend him against charges of sex trafficking in minors 
and conspiracy. 
Prosecutors asked a judge to schedule Epstein's trial for next June, but defense attorney Martin Weinberg said 
his team wanted to wait until September 2020, because they haven't yet begun to receive documents from the 
government. 
"We need time to receive a million pages of discovery and prepare to defend a four- to six-week trial," 
Weinberg said during a brief hearing in Manhattan on Wednesday. "We need time to assess events that occurred 
to 17 years ago." 
The judge set a tentative trial date of June 8 and asked the parties to keep him updated on their progress. 
Epstein, who didn't speak in court, was arrested on July 6 after stepping off his private plane in New Jersey 
from a trip to Paris. He has pleaded not guilty and said he has fully complied with the law for more than 14 
years. 
Marks on Neck 
Epstein is accused of molesting teenage girls from 2002 to 2005. He pleaded guilty in 2008 to Florida state 
charges of soliciting prostitution, after striking a non-prosecution agreement with the U.S. Federal prosecutors 
in New York say they are not bound by the deal as they now pursue their own charges. 
In court Wednesday, there was no discussion of what happened to the 66-year-old Epstein last week at New 
York's Metropolitan Correctional Center, where he has been held since his arrest. People familiar with the 
matter said he was found injured and unresponsive in his cell, with marks on his neck. Authorities are 
investigating whether he was assaulted, possibly by another inmate, or whether the injuries were self-inflicted. 
Weinberg declined to respond to questions about the incident outside court. 
Also in court was Gloria Allred, the activist lawyer who has represented women accusing Roy Moore, Bill 
Cosby and President Donald Trump of sexual assault. After the hearing, she said she was representing other 
Epstein accusers who "were not in the Florida case." She said other women have approached her about their 
experiences with Epstein but were reluctant to discuss them for fear of retaliation. 
The U.S. attorney in Manhattan, Geoffrey Berman, has urged others who may be victims to come forward and 
cooperate with the government. Allred declined to say whether her clients have spoken to prosecutors. 
The case is U.S. v. Epstein, 19-cr-490, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Collins 
Editorial: Failures of ethics 
Buffalo News 
By News Editorial Board 
7/29/19 
The ethics specialists are right and so are the members of a special ethics panel, including both Democrats and 
Republicans, who are paying attention. Good for them. The conduct of Rep. Chris Collins, R-Clarence, exposed 
a range of issues Congress needs to treat as tumors, and cut them out. 
Collins was indicted last year on allegations of insider trading. But he was routinely smashing ethical standards 
— of both formal and common sense varieties — before he was ever charged with a crime. 
A year before Collins was indicted, the Office of Congressional Ethics reported that it found "a substantial 
reason to believe" that Collins violated federal law by touting the stock of Innate Immunotherapeutics, an 
Australian biotech firm, based on inside information. 
The office also said Collins may have broken House ethics rules by persuading National Institutes of Health 
officials to meet with a staffer from that company. 
At least as troubling are the actions Collins took that were not deemed to be ethical violations. Speaking to a 
bipartisan House task force charged with drawing up new ethics rules based on Collins' arrest, ethics experts 
worried about lawmakers who sit on the boards of privately owned companies, or who serve as partners in other 
businesses or who are directors of nonprofit organizations. Collins still does all three. 
Earlier this year, in response to Collins' arrest, the House barred lawmakers from serving on the boards of 
publicly traded companies. Collins did that, too, as a board member — and leading stockholder — of Innate 
Immunotherapeutics. It's how prosecutors say he obtained the insider information that led to his arrest. 
There was more. Collins authored a provision of the 2016 "21st Century Cures Act" that sped drug approval for 
companies like Innate. Collins, with a straight face, claimed there was no conflict because Innate had no 
business before U.S. regulators. But in 2017, the company practically beamed that it had "received clearance 
from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the Company's Investigational New Drug (IND) application 
lodged last month." 
The fact that Collins' role in the legislation could also have benefited other companies — and may even have 
been worthy of passage — does nothing to change the associated fact that he was pushing for legislation whose 
adoption could have lined his pockets. It was classic self-dealing. 
The drug in question was meant to treat multiple sclerosis. It failed in clinical trials in 2017 and prosecutors say 
Collins illegally spread the word to family and others who were able to sell their stock before its price collapsed 
on the bad news. 
Collins has pleaded not guilty to the charges. His trial is scheduled for February. But regardless of what a judge 
or jury ultimately decides about Collins, he has shown himself to be indifferent to the need for a member of 
EFTA00018482
--- PAGE 18 ---
SDNY News Clips, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 
Congress to conduct himself in a way that reflects well on the institution and on the voters who entrust him with 
public office. 
In that, he has shown Congress that it needs to act. It can't count on its members using good judgment, 
especially when millions of dollars are at stake. 
The good news is that it seems ready to meet that public obligation. It is considering measures that would 
prohibit lawmakers from serving as partners in limited liability corporations, joining committees that oversee 
their business interests and serving on the boards of nonprofit organizations. Staff members would also be 
barred. 
Sadly, some Republican members have defended Collins, despite the clear conflicts of interest. But the 
Republican on the ethics task force, Rep. Van Taylor of Texas, expressed no disagreement with the panel's 
Democrat, Pennsylvania Rep. Susan Wild, who said she expected to move "rather quickly" on writing new 
rules. 
Taylor sees the tasks as "very narrow," focused on preventing lawmakers from serving in outside positions that 
could pose conflicts. The remarkable thing is that those restrictions need to be put in writing. Thank Collins for 
that.

Securities and Commodities Fraud 
Stewart 
Southern District Will Pursue A Retrial Of "Silver Platter" Case 
Forbes 
By Walter Pavlo 
7/30/19 
Sean Stewart was indicted on insider trading charges back in May 2015 during U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara's 
reign over the Southern District of New York. Now, over four years since his indictment, Sean can reflect back 
on a wild journey of being convicted, sentenced to 3 years prison, having that conviction overturned, being 
released from prison halfway through his term and, now, having a new date to go back to trial to face the 
charges again. 
Sean Stewart was indicted on insider trading for passing material non-public information on potential deals to 
his father, Robert, who then passed it on to his former friend and trader, Richard Cunniffe. Sean, a Yale 
graduate who had worked in investment banking at JPMorgan Chase and Perella Weinberg, mentioned some 
details about his work while talking to Robert. Sean's information made it to Cunniffe who made over a million 
dollars on the trades, sharing a small amount (less $100,000) with Robert. How much did Sean make on the 
trades? ZERO dollars. He had no idea that Cunniffe traded because he did not even know who Cunniffe was. 
It was a clear case of misappropriation where information was used without Sean's knowledge, so it was not a 
"classical" insider trading case. However, Bharara's team of U.S. attorneys was looking for cases that targeted 
wealthy Wall Street traders who seemed to have an advantage over the average trader. Sean's case was a good 
fit. 
Cunniffe was busted by the FBI and soon became a government informant, taping calls and other meetings with 
Robert. In one of those calls, Robert stated that Sean said of the information he had passed on to Cunniffe, "I 
can't believe it. I handed you this on a silver platter and you didn't invest." So the primary evidence in the case, 
the case that came to be known as the "silver platter" case, was based on a statement that was attributed to Sean. 
It's a phrase that Sean's new defense team wants to be excluded from the proceedings. 
When Robert was arrested, under duress of FBI questioning, he said nine (9) times that Sean was not in on his 
scheme with Cunniffe (here is entire tape transcript here). Robert also admitted his own role and that of 
Cunniffe's during the interrogation. When it came to trial, neither that tape nor Robert's testimony was allowed 
because of legal maneuvering by prosecutors. The video tape was suppressed and Robert did not testify due to 
threats from prosecutors that he would be charged for peijury due to his conflicting accounts. Here is what the 
jury missed from that tape: 
FBI AGENT: Tell me about the first time that Sean gave you information on a deal. 
ROBERT STEWART: Well, uh, I wouldn't characterize any of these as — 
I mean Sean would mention stuff. 
I don't think he had any idea that I would trade on any of this stuff. Uh, I've never mentioned that I did, to him. 
Ummm 
EFTA00018484
--- PAGE 20 ---
SDNY News Clips, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 
AGENT: If that's true, how do you explain the comment you made to Rick [Cunniffe] that Sean got angry with 
you when he gave you this information on a silver platter and you didn't invest. 
ROBERT: Uhh, I think I was just saying that to Rick because Sean said, oh, you know, ahh, all these deals, you 
know, you — 
if you were trading you could make like millions of dollars. And I said, you know, Sean, no 
one's going to trade and make millions of dollars on this stuff. That wasn't his intention. 
Robert took the 5th but did submit an affidavit that if he were to testify he would have said Sean did not know 
about the trades by Cunniffe. 
Looking back at the trial, there was not a single email, document, or text message that suggested that Sean was 
a knowingly participated in the trading scheme. This is interesting since there were so many incriminating 
documents between Cunniffe and Robert. There were no witnesses who gave testimony on Sean's knowledge 
and intent, including Cunniffe, the cooperator, who on the stand acknowledged that he never knew Sean. 
Furtnermore, trading records and actions undertaken by Sean suggest he did not know trading had taken place. 
Last fall, the 2nd Circuit overturned Sean's conviction, something rare in most cases, especially a reversal on an 
evidentiary ruling, which suggests the 2nd Circuit felt that Sean may be innocent and the judge's mistakes 
resulted in an unfair trial. The appellate court ruled that Robert's post-arrest video interrogation should have 
been allowed. Sean was released from prison and has been in legal limbo until the SDNY decided that they 
would move to move forward with another trial on the same charges. 
Stewart will have a new judge this time around. U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain was replaced by Judge 
Rakoff, a man who seems to be on a mission to define insider trading laws himself. He also has new attorneys 
Steven M. Witzel, Lawrence Gerschwer, R. David Gallo and Leigh G. Rome of Fried Frank Harris Shriver & 
Jacobson LLP. 
If Sean is found guilty, he would face the prospect of being sentenced to prison and returning to prison to 
complete a term. On the other hand, it would not be out of the question for Judge Rakoff to give him "time 
served" in prison even if Sean is found guilty. Rakoff, not a fan of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, seems to 
be one of those judges that uses common sense in his approach to sentencing. Earlier this week, Rakoff 
sentenced a man to 14 months in prison for knowingly leaking insider information on Sherwin Williams' 
acquisition of Valspar. 
While Sean may have made some mistakes, these could have been handled by the companies he worked for 
and, at the most severe, an enforcement action by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SDNY seems 
intent on trying to interpret insider trading laws by putting on elaborate trials with the threat of putting people in 
prison for years. It is a waste of resources. 
It looks like the ghost of Bharara still haunts the SDNY.

Thompson 
Easton man accused of stealing $7M via fake Bitcoin transactions 
Lehigh Valley Live 
By Sarah Cassi 
7/30/19 
An Easton man who headed a cryptocurrency escrow company was arrested last week on federal charges he 
allegedly stole $7 million from two companies by lying about Bitcoin transactions. 
Jon Barry Thompson, also known as J. Barry Thompson, was the principal of Volantis, which included a 
cryptocurrency escrow company called Volantis Escrow Platform LLC and a related company, Volantis Market 
Making LCC. 
The 48-year-old Thompson was arrested in Easton, and was charged with two counts each of commodities fraud 
and wire fraud. Easton police assisted in serving the arrest warrant at 6:15 a.m. Thursday at Thompson's West 
Burke Street home on College Hill. 
What happens to the money when a criminal's stash is in bitcoin? 
When a criminal's stash is in bitcoin, the stakes are now much higher in forfeiture cases with the soaring value 
of the virtual currency. 
Thompson was released after posting $500,000 bond. Messages left for comment at a phone number listed for 
Thompson and for his defense attorney, Matthew Siembieda, were not immediately returned. 
Prosecutors said Thompson stole $7 million from two companies after lying about transactions of the peer-to-
peer digital currency Bitcoin -- $3 million from one company and $4 million from a second. 
Thompson offered minimized settlement default risk in cryptocurrency transactions, and claimed there was no 
risk of default, prosecutors allege. 
In June and July 2018, Thompson convinced the first company to send Volantis more than $3 million for a 
Bitcoin purchase, prosecutors allege. Thompson allegedly assured the company he had the Bitcoin in hand and 
that money could not be lost. 
Thompson took the money, but never provided the company the promised Bitcoin or returned its money, 
prosecutors said. 
Thompson allegedly gave the company a fake account statement showing he had the company's money but in 
reality sent the more than $3 million to a third-party entity purportedly in exchange for Bitcoin without first 
receiving any of the Bitcoin in hand. 
In July 2018, Thompson allegedly convinced a second company to send Volantis more than $4 million for 
Bitcoin purchases. Again, Thompson is accused of sending a substantial portion of the money to a third party 
without first receiving any Bitcoin in return, prosecutors allege. 
EFTA00018486
--- PAGE 22 ---
SDNY News Clips, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 
Thompson never gave the second company any Bitcoin and did not return its money, prosecutors said. 
"Jon Thompson induced investors to engage in cryptocurrency transactions through his company, Volantis 
Market Making, by touting a transaction structure that would eliminate any risk of loss during the purchase," 
Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said in a news release. "As his clients soon realized, however, 
Thompson's representations were false, and these cryptocurrency investors ultimately lost all of the money they 
had entrusted with him because of his lies." 
FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge Sweeney said Thompson used phrases and terminology that the victimized 
companies didn't understand, and he "allegedly preyed on their ignorance of the emerging cryptocurrency." 
"Thompson allegedly thought no one would ask where their actual money went when they trusted him to invest 
in Bitcoin," Sweeney said. 
The complaint doesn't identify the companies allegedly victimized by Thompson. 
Forbes previously reported Symphony, an Irish investment company that specializes in trading 
cryptocurrencies, gave Thompson 3.6 million Euros to purchase Bitcoin on its behalf. 
Symphony never received any Bitcoin and its money was never returned. 
In that case, the plaintiff withdrew the complaint it had brought in federal court in Pennsylvania and, instead, 
reached a private settlement with Thompson. Thompson then breached the agreement by failing to make the 
first settlement payment, Forbes reported.

Pinto-Thomaz 
Popular Paint Brand Insider Trading, Results In Prison Term: Feds 
Patch 
By Chris Dehnel 
7/30/19 
A former analyst for a major financial ratings agency is to spend more than a year in prison for an insider 
trading scheme involving his hairdresser, a jeweler and two major paint brands sold prominently in Connecticut. 
Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States Attorney for the southern district of New York, announced that 
Sebastian Pinto-Thomaz, 34, a former credit ratings analyst at Standard & Poor's, was sentenced in Manhattan 
federal court to 14 months in prison for participating in two schemes to trade on material, nonpublic information 
in advance of the Sherwin-Williams Company's acquisition of the Valspar Corporation. 
Valspar is the brand sold by Lowe's. 
Pinto-Thomaz was convicted on April 26, following a jury trial before U.S. District Judge Jed S. Rakoff, who 
also imposed Monday's sentence. 
In summarizing the case, Berman said, "As an employee of Standard & Poor's, Sebastian Pinto-Thomaz was 
privy to potentially lucrative information about business acquisition plans. Instead of protecting that 
information, as he had sworn to do, he shared it with a friend and with his hairdresser. In turn, they bet on a 
stock that they knew to be a sure thing, and raked in nearly $300,000 in profits. Pinto-Thomaz painted himself 
into a corner when he and his co-defendants exploited insider information to reap illegal profits. Now they all 
face time in prison for their misdeeds." 
When a company announces an acquisition, the acquiring company often seeks the opinion of a credit rating 
agency regarding the potential impact that the acquisition could have on the acquiring company's 
creditworthiness, Berman said. Therefore, companies often contact rating agencies before an acquisition is 
publicly announced in order to secure the rating agency's views on how a possible acquisition could impact a 
company's credit rating, he said. 
All major rating agencies offer a service — sometimes known as a Rating Evaluation Service, or RES — that 
provides the company with a rating committee decision with respect to a proposed acquisition. 
In March 2016, Standard and Poor's, a credit rating agency in New York, assigned Pinto-Thomazto work on a 
RES for the Sherwin-Williams Company in advance of its contemplated but unannounced acquisition of the 
Valspar Corporation, according to casae records. 
In connection with the assignment, Pinto-Thomaz received material, nonpublic or "inside" information the deal 
about Sherwin-Williams's planned acquisition of Valspar prior to the public announcement of the acquisition. 
S&P's written policies prohibited the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, which included the 
inside information, Berman said. 
During his tenure at S&P, Pinto-Thomaz reviewed and certified his duties of loyalty and confidentiality to S&P 
and its clients, according to case records.

In March 2016, Pinto-Thomaz passed the inside information about the paint merger to Jeremy Millul, a friend, 
and to Abell Oujaddou, his hairdresser, so that they could "use it to make profitable trades in Valspar stock and 
options.," Berman said. 
On March 21, 2016, the first trading day after the public announcement of the acquisition, the price of Valspar 
stock increased approximately 23 percent over the prior day's close. 
Millul, a Manhattan jeweler opened a brokerage account on March 13, 2016, and shortly thereafter purchased 
480 shares of Valspar common stock, case records show. On March 18, 2016, the last trading day before the 
acquisition was publicly announced, Millul also purchased 75 out-of-the-money Valspar call options, according 
to case records. 
After the acquisition was publicly announced, Millul sold his Valspar stock and options for approximately 
$106,806 in profits, Berman said. 
Oujaddou, a Manhattan hairstylist and salon owner who has known Pinto-Thomaz for years and is a close friend 
with his mother, was given inside information during a haircut on March 8 or 9, 2016, according to case 
records. On March 10 through March 18, 2016, Oujaddou, who had never previously purchased Valspar or 
Sherwin-Williams purchased 8,630 shares of Valspar stock, case records show. 
After the acquisition was publicly announced, Oujaddou sold his Valspar shares for approximately $192,080 in 
profits, according to case records. 
Following the trading, Oujaddou met Pinto-Thomaz in the paint aisle of a hardware store and paid him a 
kickback, Berman said. 
Pinto-Thomaz denied having a relationship with anyone on the list of pre-merger trading. 
In addition to his prison term, Pinto-Thomaz was sentenced to three years of supervised release and ordered to 
pay a fine of $15,000 and a forfeiture money judgment in the amount of $7,500. 
Millul and Oujaddou each previously pled guilty and were to be sentenced on July 30.

Narcotics 
Castro 
Drug Dealer Forfeits Over $4M in Bitcoin as Part of a Guilt) Plea 
All Stocks 
By Ravi Rd 
7/31/19 
According to a July 25 press release from the United States Attorney's Office of the Southern District of New 
York, the very active Bitcoin drug dealer Richard Castro has pleaded guilty of committing illicit activities such 
as money laundering and distributing three controlled substances through the dark web and encrypted emails. 
Castro was charged by the US Department of Justice (DoJ) and agreed to forfeit more than $4 million including 
cryptocurrency funds available in his seven different Bitcoin wallets. 
Castro, 36-year-old based in Windermere, Florida, operated under multiple badges, such as "Chems_usa," 
"Chemical_usa" and "Jagger109" to distribute three controlled opioid substances namely carfentanil, fentanyl, 
and phenyl fentanyl. Dream Market and AlphaBay were two of his primary market places on the dark web, 
where he sold drugs in exchange for cryptocurrency. 
The three controlled opioid substances were sold from November 2015 to 2019 by Castro and another co-
conspirator, Luis Fernandez. Fentanyl, the first of these three is considered to be significantly stronger than 
heroin while Carfentanil is believed to be 100 times stronger than fentanyl. Castro sold these substances under 
the three aforementioned monikers which ultimately used to prove that he is indeed the leader of this 
conspiracy. 
On Dream Market, Castro once boasted about 3,200 transactions that he had completed on various dark web 
marketplaces. Out of these 3,200 transactions, 1,800 transactions were successfully completed on AlphaBay 
alone. The conspirators apparently also received many positive reviews for the quality of synthetic opioid 
substance they were selling. 
In June 218, Castro informed his clients that he would only accept orders received by encrypted emails and 
declared the organization is getting the business off from the dark web. Customers who wanted to buy narcotics 
had to acquire the address of the encrypted email from "Chems_usa" by paying certain fees. Unfortunately for 
Castro, an undercover law enforcement officer also obtained the encrypted email and placed an order, which 
ultimately led to his arrest. 
Castro was accepting the payments in Bitcoin which were later distributed in seven different BTC wallets. 
Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said: 
"As he admitted today, for years, Richard Castro used the dark web to distribute prolific quantities of powerful 
opioids, including fentanyl and carfentanil. Castro thought he could hide behind the anonymity of the intemet, 
and use online pseudonyms to deal drugs — like thems_usa' and `Chemical_usa.' Thanks to our law 
enforcement partners, thems_usa' is now in U.S. prison."

Rochester Drug Company 
Distributor Has Been Shipping Excess Opioids to Small Towns 
Legal Reader 
By Sara E. Teller 
7/31/19 
Miami-Luken Inc., an Ohio drug wholesale distributor, and four people including two former executives have 
been charged with selling millions of pills amid the opioid epidemic despite knowing the dangers. The 
indictment charged the Springboro, Ohio-based company; Anthony Rattini, the company's former president; 
James Barlay, former compliance officer, and two pharmacists with "conspiring to distribute controlled 
substances." Prosecutors have alleged "Miami-Luken ignored obvious signs that drugs were being diverted to 
illegal users and dealers between 2011 and 2015." The company was shipping 4.9 million pills to Miller-
West's drugstore in Oceana, W.Va., where the population is just under 1,400. 
"Miami-Luken and the executives failed to guard against the dangerous drugs it was shipping to pharmacies in 
five states from being diverted for illegal uses or to report suspicious orders to the U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration," they added. 
The distributor shipped millions of pills to desolate and rural areas of Appalachia which was hit especially hard 
by the epidemic. "Records show Miami-Luken also distributed 3.7 million hydrocodone pills from 2008 to 
2011 to a pharmacy in Kermit, West Virginia, a town of just 400 people," prosecutors said. The pharmacists 
charged were Devonna Miller-West, the owner of Oceana, West Virginia's Westside Pharmacy, and Samuel 
Ballengee, owner of Williamson, West Virginia's Tug Valley Pharmacy. 
The company was also shipping some to other "unnamed pharmacists and physicians," the indictment alleged. 
"There's a need, in my opinion, to devote sufficient charges right here and now to stop the dying," United States 
Attorney Benjamin C. Glassman said, adding investigators found "many overdose deaths that could arguably be 
linked to the conduct of people accused in the conspiracy." 
In April of this year, criminal charges were brought against Rochester Drug Co-operative. Geoffrey S. Berman, 
the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and Ray Donovan, the Special Agent in 
Charge of the New York Division of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), announced the 
charges. Rochester Drug Co-Operative is one of the 10 largest pharmaceutical distributors in the United States. 
Charges were also filed against Laurence F. Doud III, the company's former chief executive officer; and 
William Pietruszewski, the company's former chief compliance officer. The indictment was specifically for 
"unlawfully distributing oxycodone and fentanyl, and conspiring to defraud the DEA," according to court 
documents. 
Berman said at the time, "This prosecution is the first of its kind: executives of a pharmaceutical distributor and 
the distributor itself have been charged with drug trafficking, trafficking the same drugs that are fueling the 
opioid epidemic that is ravaging this country. Our Office will do everything in its power to combat this 
epidemic, from street-level dealers to the executives who illegally distribute drugs from their boardrooms." The 
company paid $20 million to resolve the charges.

DEA Special Agent in Charge Ray Donovan said, "Today's charges should send shock waves throughout the 
pharmaceutical industry reminding them of their role as gatekeepers of prescription medication. The 
distribution of life-saving medication is paramount to public health; similarly, so is identifying rogue members 
of the pharmaceutical and medical fields whose diversion contributes to the record-breaking drug overdoses in 
America. DEA investigates DEA Registrants who divert controlled pharmaceutical medication into the wrong 
hands for the wrong reason. This historic investigation unveiled a criminal element of denial in RDC's 
compliance practices and holds them accountable for their egregious non-compliance according to the law."

Civil 
Life Spine 
Lawsuit against Huntley-based medical device company alleges kickback scheme 
Northwest Herald 
By Drew Zimmerman 
7/30/19 
Life Spine, a medical technology manufacturer in Huntley, is the defendant in a federal lawsuit alleging 
violations of the False Claims Act by offering lucrative incentives to surgeons in exchange for their use of Life 
Spine products. 
The suit, which was filed last week by the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Southern District of New York, alleges 
that the company entered into agreements with dozens of surgeons as a means to pay more than $7 million in 
illegal kickbacks — including consulting fees, royalties and intellectual acquisition payments - for the surgeon's 
use of Life Spine's equipment. 
The suit also alleges that these agreements, spanning an estimated seven-year period, were done with the 
knowledge, involvement and participation of Life Spine President and CEO Michael Butler and Vice President 
of Business Development Richard Greiber, who also are being charged. 
"Defendants are liable for damages based on the payment of claims submitted to Medicare and Medicaid for 
medical services and procedures involving Life Spine Products that were tainted by illegal kickbacks," the suit 
reads. 
About half of Life Spine's total domestic sales of spinal products between January 2012 and at least December 
2018, were attributable to surgeries performed by these paid surgeons, according to the suit. 
In addition to the consulting fees and royalties being paid, surgeons also were treated to dinners at high-end 
restaurants, Chicago Cubs games and other perks. 
"As alleged, Life Spine and its senior management flagrantly ignored the law by paying surgeons millions of 
dollars in fees and royalties to get them to use Life Spine products during spinal surgeries," Manhattan U.S. 
Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said in a release. "Kickbacks to doctors can alter or compromise their judgment 
about the medical care and services to provide to patients, and can increase healthcare costs." 
For the first two counts of violating the False Claims Act — which are against Life Spine, Butler and Greiber —
the plaintiff is seeking treble damages and civil penalties to the maximum amount allowed by state law. 
For the third count of unjust enrichment — which is only against Life Spine — the plaintiff is seeking damages to 
the extent allowed by law. 
The plaintiff also is seeking pre- and post-judgment interest, costs and any other relief the court deems 
appropriate.

Matters of Interest 
The U.S. said a California cherry-picker went to Pakistan for terrorist training. Now the case has 
collapsed. 
Washington Post 
By Meagan Flynn 
7/31/19 
It was a month after 9/11, and Osama bin Laden's face flashed across the news on Naseem Khan's TV screen. 
The FBI was sitting in his living room in Bend, Ore., and Khan sensed an opportunity. The agents had come for 
an entirely different purpose and were ready to leave — until Khan pointed at the screen and said he thought he 
could help with something else. A few years ago, he said, he saw bin Laden's second-in-command, Ayman al-
Zawahiri, one of the most wanted terrorists in the world, at a mosque in the wine-country town of Lodi, Calif. 
The agents perked up, intrigued by the possibility. Had they really just stumbled into a hot tip on al-Qaeda 
while speaking to a 28-year-old McDonald's worker and convenience store clerk? The FBI thought Khan was 
onto something — a possible "sleeper cell" of terrorism hidden in Lodi — and decided to dispatch him there as 
a confidential informant. 
Khan wouldn't find any associates of Zawahiri at the mosque in Lodi, and U.S. officials and terrorism experts 
now doubt his initial claim about Zawahiri was ever true. But Khan would find 19-year-old Hamid Hayat —
who would soon become the face of homegrown terrorism in post-9111 America. 
They met at the mosque, and Khan learned Hayat was taking a trip to Pakistan with family. Over and over, in 
recorded conversations, he returned to the same question: Would Hayat commit to attending a terrorist training 
camp, as he had promised? 
Now, a judge's order on Tuesday casts doubt on whether Hayat ever actually did. 
Hayat, a cherry-picker and son of an ice cream truck driver, was convicted of attending the alleged terrorist 
training camp and sentenced to 24 years in prison in 2006. Prosecutors, relying on Khan and Hayat's own 
statements, alleged that he attended the camp for three to six months sometime in 2003. The case would become 
one of the most high-profile examples of the government's fight against terrorism in the immediate aftermath of 
9/11, especially because Hayat, after hours of interrogation by FBI agents, confessed to attending the camp. 
But on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Garland E. Burrell Jr. vacated his conviction and sentence, finding that 
Hayat had inadequate defense during the 2006 trial while casting doubt on the facts of the case. Burrell 
questioned whether jurors would have convicted him had they heard evidence from witnesses in Pakistan, 
which the judge said likely would have "undermined" jurors' confidence in Hayat's confession alone. His 
attorneys have maintained the confession was coerced during an exhausting interrogation. 
Had the defense attorney actually interviewed any witnesses in Pakistan who spent significant time with Hayat 
during his trip, she would have discovered that they recalled Hayat spent most of his time playing video games 
and cricket and that the purpose of his visit was for his family to find him a wife, according to Burrell's order. 
No one identified any prolonged disappearance that would have allowed him to visit a terrorist training camp 
for three to six months as prosecutors alleged and Hayat said in the confession, Burrell noted. Burrell, who 
EFTA00018496
--- PAGE 32 ---
SDNY News Clips, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 
oversaw Hayat's original trial, found the witnesses gave consistent statements and could have provided Hayat a 
credible alibi. 
"Showing that Hayat could not have been at a jihadi training camp for the `period of months' specified in the 
indictment would have been completely consistent with the defense that Hayat's confession should not be 
credited and the government lacked other supporting evidence," a U.S. magistrate wrote in making the 
recommendation that Hayat's conviction be vacated. Burrell adopted most of the magistrate's findings of fact. 
The government has not decided yet whether to appeal the decision, a spokeswoman in the U.S. attorney's 
office in the Eastern District of California said in a statement, the Sacramento Bee reported. "We are in the 
process of reviewing the district court decision and assessing what steps, if any, should be taken and 
considering all our options," the statement said. 
Hayat, now 36, is currently being held in a federal prison in Phoenix. His attorneys are seeking his immediate 
release. 
The case against Hayat and his father, Umer, who was accused of lying to the FBI, heaped international 
attention on the Northern California town of Lodi. Seemingly overnight, the town went from the zinfandel 
capital of the world to an alleged terrorism "sleeper cell" — a claim authorities would later walk back. 
At the time he met Khan in August 2002, Hayat lived in his parents' garage and didn't have many friends, as 
the Intercept recounted in a 2016 investigation. Posing as a radical Islamist, Khan nudged Hayat into 
conversations that were anti-American and supportive of Islamic fundamentalist groups, and to his delight 
Hayat went along with it, according to recorded conversations cited in federal court documents. Hayat approved 
of the beheading of Wall Street Journal journalist Daniel Pearl by Pakistani militants. He told Khan he believed 
jihadists had attended his grandfather's religious school in Pakistan and claimed his grandfather was so 
politically well connected that the Pakistani president enlisted him in efforts to persuade the Taliban to turn over 
bin Laden after 9/11. 
Then came the terrorist camps. Hayat said he had seen one in an online video — and expressed interest in going 
himself. Khan, feeding the intel to the FBI, egged him on. 
But once in Pakistan, Hayat kept making excuses, according to the judge's order. When Khan told him he was 
being "lazy," Hayat claimed the climate had changed and it got too hot outside — the terrorist camp was 
canceled, he said. Khan was starting to get mad. His nudges turned to threats. 
"God willing, when I come to Pakistan and I see you, I'm going to ... force you to, get you from your throat and 
... throw you in the madrassa," Khan said in one expletive-laden recorded conversation, as the Intercept 
reported. 
"I'm not going to go with that," Hayat said. 
"Oh yeah, you will go," Khan told him. "Yeah, you will go. You know what? Maybe I can't fight with you in 
America, but I can beat your a-- in Pakistan, so nobody's going to come to your rescue." 
In their last conversation, according to the Intercept, which obtained all the recordings, Hayat said he "never 
intended on going to a camp." 
EFTA00018497
--- PAGE 33 ---
SDNY News Clips, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 
Hayat denied attending a camp in his first interview with the FBI in Japan, before flying to San Francisco. He 
confessed during his second interview in California upon his return in June 2005. 
"FBI: Al Qaeda plot possibly uncovered," rang a CNN headline in June 2005, saying those involved "Trained 
on how to kill Americans." 
Months after Hayat's arrest, then-director of national intelligence, John D. Negroponte, testified in a 
congressional hearing that a "network of Islamic extremists in Lodi, Calif., for example, maintained connections 
with Pakistani militant groups, recruited United States citizens." 
But ultimately, no other terrorism cases arose from the investigation except for the one against Hayat. Two 
imams were investigated but were never criminally charged with anything. They had overstayed religious 
worker visas, authorities discovered. 
A retired FBI agent who watched Hayat's interrogation and the resulting confession told the Los Angeles Times 
it was "the sorriest interrogation, the sorriest confession, I've ever seen," believing the agents fed Hayat the 
details they wanted to hear and that Hayat repeated them so he could leave. He was barred from offering his 
testimony at trial. Burrell found that the failure to challenge the validity of the confession by presenting a false 
confession expert also contributed to his finding that Hayat had ineffective counsel. 
Khan was ultimately paid nearly $230,000 for assisting the FBI over three years. During Hayat's trial, his 
defense attorney questioned how one fast-food worker's implausible claim that he saw the world's most wanted 
terrorist in a small-town mosque could have "sparked this whole investigation with this ridiculous claim," the 
Times reported in 2006. 
Hayat's attorneys filed an appeal in 2014 and ultimately sought to interview numerous witnesses in Pakistan 
who could account for his whereabouts during the trip from 2003 to 2005. They appeared for sworn depositions 
on video in 2018. When Hayat's attorney, Dennis Riordan, asked his uncle whether he "would have known" if 
Hayat disappeared from their rural hamlet, Muhammad Anas said, "Naturally, I would have noticed," the 
Marshall Project reported then. 
The judge found that the witnesses "corroborated each other on some important points," regarding trips the 
family took throughout Pakistan and who they visited. Once or twice a month, they traveled to a hospital for his 
mother's medical treatment. 
On Tuesday, Hayat's family issued a statement applauding the judge's decision to throw out Hayat's 
conviction, the Sacramento Bee reported. 
"We have been waiting 14 long years for Hamid to be freed," the statement read. "Hamid cannot get those 14 
years of his life back, but we are relieved to see the case take such a big step forward. We miss him and hope to 
be reunited with him soon."

Fed Cuts Interest Rates for First Time Since 2008 Crisis 
New York Times 
By Jeanna Smialek 
7/31/19 
The Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the first time in more than a decade on Wednesday as it attempted to 
guard the record-long economic expansion against mounting global risks. 
The widely expected quarter-point move, the Fed's first since it cut rates to near zero in 2008, is meant to 
protect the economy against the potentially harmful effects of a growth slowdown in China and Europe and 
uncertainty from President Trump's trade war. 
"In light of the implications of global developments for the economic outlook as well as muted inflation 
pressures, the committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate," according to the Federal 
Open Market Committee's policy statement. 
But the Fed did not indicate that this was the beginning of a rate-cutting campaign, suggesting instead that the 
cut was a minor adjustment intended to help the economy weather any challenges from slowing global growth 
and Mr. Trump's trade fights.

Catch up and prep for the week ahead with this newsletter of the most important business insights, delivered 
Sundays. 
While Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, left the door open to additional rate moves if the economy showed signs 
of sputtering, he did not indicate the central bank was poised to engage in the sort of deep cutting cycle that the 
Fed has done in the past to avert or offset recessions. 
"It's not the beginning of a long series of rate cuts - I didn't say it's just one," Mr. Powell said at a news 
conference following the Fed's two-day policy meeting. "What we're seeing is that it's appropriate to adjust 
policy to a somewhat more accommodative stance over time, and that's how we're looking at it." 
The widely expected move from the central bank was initially greeted with a shrug in financial markets, where 
investors have been factoring in a rate cut for months. But the stock market turned lower after Mr. Powell began 
his news conference at 2:30 p.m., as investors absorbed the chair's comments as indicating the Fed was unlikely 
to make additional cuts anytime soon, as investors had hoped. 
By the end of the day, the S&P 500 was down 1.1 percent. It was the benchmark index's worst decline since 
May 31. 
The Fed dropped its target rate to a range between 2 percent to 2.25 percent. Officials also announced an early 
end to its efforts to shrink the Fed's balance sheet, another attempt to keep the economy moving. The central 
bank's holdings of government-backed bonds swelled during the financial crisis as it bought assets to try to 
reinvigorate growth. Policymakers have been slowly siphoning off securities to return their balance sheet to a 
more normal size, and that process was slated to end in September. It will now conclude Aug. I. 
Why the Federal Reserve Cut Interest Rates 
EFTA00018499
--- PAGE 35 ---
SDNY News Clips, Wednesday, July 31, 2019 
The move is what's called an "insurance cut" — one that central bankers are making to keep growth chugging 
along. 
Both Eric Rosengren, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, and Esther George, the president of 
the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, voted against Wednesday's decision, preferring instead to leave rates 
unchanged. Those dissents marked the second and third of Jerome H. Powell's term as chair. 
While Fed officials said they expect economic expansion to continue and the labor market to remain strong 
"uncertainties about this outlook remain." 
Mr. Powell said the Fed's move was "intended to insure against downside risks from weak global growth and 
trade tensions." 
He said that manufacturing around the world was weakening and that Mr. Trump's trade dispute was continuing 
to spook American businesses. "The ongoing uncertainty is making some companies more cautious about their 
capital spending," he said. 
Officials did not indicate in their statement whether this cut would be followed by additional moves. The Fed's 
June economic projections suggest policymakers envision cutting rates slightly to shore up the economy, rather 
than beginning an easing cycle that will return rates to zero. 
"As the committee contemplates the future path of the target range for the federal funds rate, it will continue to 
monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to 
sustain the expansion," the Fed said in its statement, seemingly leaving its options open. 
Mr. Powell said the committee viewed the move as a "mid-cycle adjustment to policy," suggesting that the Fed 
sees this cut as more similar to two instances in the 1990s, during which the Fed moved rates down slightly to 
get the economy through periods of uncertainty, rather than the beginning of a rate-cutting campaign. 
The Fed's rate cut carries political risks, given Mr. Trump's attacks on the central bank. Mr. Trump has been 
denouncing the Fed in speeches and on Twitter for the past year, criticizing its four 2018 rate increases and 
blaming its policies for slowing the American economy. Some onlookers may see Wednesday's move as caving 
to the president. 
The Fed operates independently of the White House. It attributed the change, which officials have been 
signaling for months and which investors fully expected, to growing economic concerns. 
"We also don't conduct monetary policy to prove our independence," Mr. Powell said. 
The central bank is trying to extend a record-long economic expansion, because officials believe that doing so 
will allow the Fed to achieve its goals of maximum employment and slow but steady inflation. The 
unemployment rate is hovering around its lowest level in 50 years, but that has yet to push wages dramatically 
higher in a way that forces companies to lift prices more quickly. 
Inflation has run shy of the Fed's 2 percent goal since the central bank formally adopted it in 2012. A little 
inflation helps to grease the wheels of a healthy economy, allowing businesses to raise wages faster and lifting 
interest rates, giving the central bank more room to cut in the event of a downturn.

Prices picked up just 1.6 percent in the year through June, not counting volatile food and fuel costs. 
Wages are growing only moderately. An index of employment costs climbed by 2.7 percent in the second 
quarter from a year earlier, less than expected and a slowdown from earlier in 2019, according to data released 
on Wednesday. 
Global policy uncertainty has also increased, and manufacturing is slumping the world over. Growth is slowing 
in China and Europe, and Mr. Trump's trade war with China and threats of further tariffs on United States 
trading partners are stoking uncertainty and causing businesses to hold off on investment. 
Those developments threaten the economic outlook, even as growth remains solid, consumer spending is robust 
and the job market holds up for now.

THE GOVERNMENT'S MEMORANDUM 
IN SUPPORT OF DETENTION 
For the reasons set forth herein, the Government respectfully submits that Ghislaine 
Maxwell, the defendant, poses an extreme risk of flight; that she will not be able to rebut the 
statutory presumption that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the 
appearance of the defendant as required, 18 U.S.C. § 3 I42(e)(3)(E); and that the Court should 
therefore order her detained. 
The charges in this case are unquestionably serious: the Indictment alleges that Ghislaine 
Maxwell, in partnership with Jeffrey Epstein, a serial sexual predator, exploited and abused young 
girls for years. As a result of her disturbing and callous conduct, Maxwell now faces the very real 
prospect of serving many years in prison. The strength of the Government's evidence and the 
substantial prison term the defendant would face upon conviction all create a strong incentive for 
the defendant to flee. That risk is only amplified by the defendant's extensive international ties, 
her citizenship in two foreign countries, her wealth, and her lack of meaningful ties to the United 
States. In short, Maxwell has three passports, large sums of money, extensive international 
connections, and absolutely no reason to stay in the United States and face the possibility of a 
lengthy prison sentence.

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 4 Filed 07/02/20 Page 3 of 10 
BACKGROUND 
On June 29, 2020, a federal grand jury in the Southern District of New York returned a 
sealed indictment (the "Indictment") charging the defendant with one count of conspiracy to entice 
minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; one count of enticing 
a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2422 and 2; one count of 
conspiracy to transport minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; 
one count of transporting minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2423 
and 2; and two counts of perjury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1623. 
The charges arise from a scheme to sexually abuse underage girls at Epstein's properties 
in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, between approximately 1994 and 1997. During that time, 
Maxwell had a personal and professional relationship with Epstein and was one of his closest 
associates. 
Beginning in at least 1994, the defendant enticed and groomed multiple minor girls to 
engage in sex acts with Epstein, through a variety of means and methods. In particular, she played 
a key role in Epstein's abuse of minors by helping Epstein to identify, groom, and ultimately abuse 
underage girls. As a part of their scheme, the defendant and Epstein enticed and caused minor 
victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, which the defendant knew and intended 
would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
As the Indictment details, the defendant enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in 
multiple ways. For example, she attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their 
lives, taking them to the movies or on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with 
Epstein. She put victims at ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who 
seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, 
EFTA00018507
--- PAGE 4 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 4 Filed 07/02/20 Page 4 of 10 
the defendant would encourage victims to accept Epstein's offers of financial assistance, including 
offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. The victims were as young as 14 years old when 
they were groomed and abused by Maxwell and Epstein, both of whom knew that their victims 
were minors. 
The Indictment further alleges that the defendant lied under oath to conceal her crimes. In 
2016, the defendant gave deposition testimony in connection with a civil lawsuit in the Southern 
District of New York. During the deposition, the defendant was asked questions about her role in 
facilitating the abuse of minors. The defendant repeatedly lied under oath when questioned about 
her conduct with minor girls. 
ARGUMENT 
I. 
Applicable Law 
Under the Bail Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. §§ 3141 et seq., federal courts are empowered to 
order a defendant's detention pending trial upon a determination that the defendant is either a 
danger to the community or a risk of flight. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e). A finding of risk of flight must 
be supported by a preponderance of the evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Patriarca, 948 F.2d 
789, 793 (1st Cir. 1991); United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 5 (2d Cir. 1987); United States v. 
Chimurenga, 760 F.2d 400, 405 (2d Cir. 1985). A finding of dangerousness must be supported by 
clear and convincing evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Ferranti, 66 F.3d 540, 542 (2d Cir. 
1995); Patriarca, 948 F.2d at 792; Chimurenga, 760 F.2d at 405. 
The Bail Reform Act lists four factors to be considered in the detention analysis: (1) the 
nature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person; 
(3) the history and characteristics of the defendant, including the person's "character . . . [and] 
financial resources"; and (4) the seriousness of the danger posed by the defendant's release. See 
EFTA00018508
--- PAGE 5 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 4 Filed 07/02/20 Page 5 of 10 
U.S.C. § 3142(g). Evidentiary rules do not apply at detention hearings, and the Government is 
entitled to present evidence by way of proffer, among other means. See 18 U.S.C. § 3142(0(2); 
see also United States v. LaFontaine, 210 F.3d 125, 130-31 (2d Cir. 2000) (Government entitled 
to proceed by proffer in detention hearings). 
Where a judicial officer concludes after a hearing that "no condition or combination of 
conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any 
other person and the community, such judicial officer shall order the detention of the person before 
trial." 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(1). Additionally, where, as here, a defendant is charged with 
committing an offense involving a minor victim under 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, it shall be 
presumed, subject to rebuttal, that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure 
the appearance of the defendant as required and the safety of the community. 18 U.S.C. 
§ 3142(e)(3)(E). 
II. 
Discussion 
For the reasons set forth below, the defendant presents an extreme risk of flight, and 
therefore she cannot overcome the statutory presumption in favor of detention in this case. Every 
one of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk — the nature and circumstances of the 
offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant — counsel 
strongly in favor of detention. 
A. 
The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense and the Strength of the Evidence 
The "nature and circumstances" of this offense favor detention. As the Indictment alleges, 
the defendant committed serious crimes involving the sexual exploitation of minors. See 18 U.S.C. 
§ 3142(g)(1) (specifically enumerating "whether the offense. . . involves a minor victim" as a 
factor in bail applications). Indeed, the crimes of enticing and transporting minors for illegal sex 
EFTA00018509
--- PAGE 6 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 4 Filed 07/02/20 Page 6 of 10 
acts are so serious that both crimes carry a statutory presumption that no condition or combination 
of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as required. 18 U.S.C. § 3142 
(e)(3)(E). The defendant repeatedly engaged in this conduct, targeting girls as young as 14 years 
old, for a period of years, and involving multiple minors. 
These offenses carry significant penalties, and the defendant faces up to 35 years' 
imprisonment if convicted. The possibility of a substantial sentence is a significant factor in 
assessing the risk of flight. See United States v. Moscaritolo, No. 10 Cr. 4 (JL), 2010 WL 309679, 
at *2 (D.N.H. Jan. 26, 2010) ("[T]he steeper the potential sentence, the more probable the flight 
risk is, especially considering the strong case of the government . . . .") (quoting United States v. 
Alindato—Perez, 627 F. Supp. 2d 58, 66 (D.P.R. 2009)). Here, the defendant is facing a statutory 
maximum of decades in prison. This fact alone would provide a compelling incentive for anyone 
to flee from prosecution, but the incentive to flee is especially strong for this defendant, who, at 
age 58, faces the very real prospect of spending a substantial portion of the rest of her life in prison. 
The strength of the evidence in this case underscores the risk that the defendant will become 
a fugitive. As the facts set forth in the Indictment make plain, the evidence in this case is strong. 
Multiple victims have provided detailed, credible, and corroborated information against the 
defendant. The victims are backed up contemporaneous documents, records, witness testimony, 
and other evidence. For example, flight records, diary entries, business records, and other evidence 
corroborate the victims' account of events. This will be compelling evidence of guilt at any trial 
in this case, which weighs heavily in favor of detention. 
The passage of time between the defendant's conduct and these charges does not counsel 
otherwise. As an initial matter, all of the conduct is timely charged, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3283, 
which was amended in 2003 to extend the limitations period for conduct that was timely as of the 
EFTA00018510
--- PAGE 7 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 4 Filed 07/02/20 Page 7 of 10 
date of the amendment,' to permit a prosecution at any point during the lifetime of the minor 
victim. See United States v. Chief 438 F.3d 920, 922-25 (9th Cir. 2006) (finding that because 
Congress extended the statute of limitations for sex offenses involving minors during the time the 
previous statute was still running, the extension was permissible); United States v. Pierre-Louis, 
No. 16 Cr. 541 (CM), 2018 WL 4043140, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2018) (same). Moreover, while 
the conduct alleged in the Indictment may have occurred years ago, the risk of a significant term 
of incarceration — and thus the motive to flee — is of course only very recent. 
Each of these factors — the seriousness of the allegations, the strength of the evidence, and 
the possibility of lengthy incarceration — creates an extraordinary incentive to flee. And as further 
described below, the defendant has the means and money to do so. 
B. 
The Characteristics of the Defendant 
The history and characteristics of the defendant also strongly support detention. As an 
initial matter, the defendant's extensive international ties would make it exceptionally easy for her 
to flee and live abroad. The defendant was born in France and raised in the United Kingdom, 
where she attended school. Although she became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 
2002, she also remains a citizen of the United Kingdom and France. Travel records from 
United States Customs and Border Protection ("CBP") reflect that she has engaged in frequent 
international travel, including at least fifteen international flights in the last three years to locations 
including the United Kingdom, Japan, and Qatar. In addition, CBP records reflect that, consistent 
with her citizenship status, the defendant appears to possess passports from the United States, 
France, and the United Kingdom. 
' Prior to the amendment, the statute of limitations for sexual offenses involving minors ran until 
the victim reached the age of 25, and as such, all of the relevant charges in the Indictment 
remained timely as of the 2003 amendment described above. 
EFTA00018511
--- PAGE 8 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 4 Filed 07/02/20 Page 8 of 10 
In addition, the defendant appears to have access to significant financial resources that 
would enable her flight from prosecution. Based on the Government's investigation to date, the 
Government has identified more than 15 different bank accounts held by or associated with the 
defendant from 2016 to the present, and during that same period, the total balances of those 
accounts have ranged from a total of hundreds of thousands of dollars to more than $20 
million. During the same period, the defendant engaged in transfers between her accounts of 
hundreds of thousands of dollars at a time, including at least several such significant transfers as 
recently as 2019. For example, the defendant transferred $500,000 from one of her accounts to 
another in March 2019, and transferred more than $300,000 from one of her accounts to another 
in July 2019. She has also reported, including as recently as 2019, that she holds one or more 
foreign bank accounts containing more than a million dollars. 
The defendant also appears to have reaped substantial income from a 2016 property sale. 
In particular, in 2016, the defendant appears to have sold a New York City residence for $15 
million through a limited liability company. On or about the date of the sale, amounts totaling 
more than $14 million were then deposited into an account for which the defendant was listed as 
the owner. Several days later, more than $14 million was transferred from that account into 
another account opened in the name of the defendant.2 In short, the defendant's financial resources 
appear to be substantial, and her numerous accounts and substantial money movements render her 
total financial picture opaque and indeterminate, even upon a review of bank records available to 
the Government. 
The Government additionally notes that, somewhat further back in time, in transactions occurring 
between 2007 and 2011, approximately more than $20 million was transferred from accounts 
associated with Jeffrey Epstein to accounts associated with the defendant, including amounts in 
the millions of dollars that were then subsequently transferred back to accounts associated with 
Epstein. 
EFTA00018512
--- PAGE 9 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 4 Filed 07/02/20 Page 9 of 10 
The defendant's international connections and significant financial means would present a 
clear risk of flight under normal circumstances, but in this case, the risk of flight is exacerbated by 
the transient nature of defendant's current lifestyle. In particular, the defendant has effectively 
been in hiding for approximately a year, since an indictment against Epstein was unsealed in July 
2019. Thereafter, the defendant — who had previously made many public appearances - stopped 
appearing in public entirely, instead hiding out in locations in New England. Moreover, it appears 
that she made intentional efforts to avoid detection, including moving locations at least twice, 
switching her primary phone number (which she registered under the name "G Max") and email 
address, and ordering packages for delivery with a different person listed on the shipping label. 
Most recently, the defendant appears to have been hiding on a 156-acre property acquired in an 
all-cash purchase in December 2019 (through a carefully anonymized LLC) in Bradford, New 
Hampshire, an area to which she has no other known connections. 
The defendant appears to have no ties that would motivate her to remain in the United 
States. She has no children, does not reside with any immediate family members, and does not 
appear to have any employment that would require her to remain in the United States. Nor does 
she appear to have any permanent ties to any particular location in the United States. As such, the 
Government respectfully submits that the defendant will not be able to meet her burden of 
overcoming the presumption of detention, because there are no bail conditions that could 
reasonably assure the defendant's continued appearance in this case. 
In particular, home confinement with electronic monitoring would be inadequate to 
mitigate the high risk that the defendant would flee, as she could easily remove a monitoring 
device. At best, home confinement with electronic monitoring would merely reduce her head start 
should she decide to flee. See United States v. Zarger, No. 00 Cr. 773, 2000 WL 1134364, at *1 
EFTA00018513

(E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2000) (Gleeson, J.) (rejecting defendant's application for bail in part because 
home detention with electronic monitoring "at best . . . limits a fleeing defendant's head start"); 
United States v. Benatar, No. 02 Cr. 099, 2002 WL 31410262, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 10, 2002) 
(same); see also United States v. Casteneda, No. 18 Cr. 047, 2018 WL 888744, at *9 (N.D. Cal. 
Feb. 2018) (same); United States v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp. 2d 32, 41 (D.D.C. 2005) (same). 
CONCLUSION 
As set forth above, the defendant is an extreme risk of flight. The Government respectfully 
submits that the defendant cannot meet her burden of overcoming the statutory presumption in 
favor of detention. There are no conditions of bail that would assure the defendant's presence in 
court proceedings in this case. Accordingly, any application for bail should be denied.

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 18 Filed 07/10/20 Page 5 of 26 
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 
Ghislaine Maxwell respectfully submits this Memorandum in Opposition to the 
government's July 2, 2020 Memorandum in Support of Detention ("Gov. Mem."). 
It is difficult to recall a recent case that has garnered more public attention than the 
government's prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein ("Epstein"). In July 2019, Epstein was indicted for 
offenses relating to sexual misconduct, amid overwhelming media attention focused on the 
nature of the charges and Epstein's wealth and lifestyle. On August 10, 2019, Epstein died in 
federal custody, and the media focus quickly shifted to our client—wrongly trying to substitute 
her for Epstein—even though she'd had no contact with Epstein for more than a decade, had 
never been charged with a crime or been found liable in any civil litigation, and has always 
denied any allegations of claimed misconduct. Many of these stories and online posts were 
threatening and harassing to our client and those close to her. 
But sometimes the simplest point is the most critical one: Ghislaine Maxwell is not 
Jeffrey Epstein. She was not named in the government's indictment of Epstein in 2019, despite 
the fact that the government has been investigating this case for years. Instead, the current 
indictment is based on allegations of conduct that allegedly occurred roughly twenty-five years 
ago. Ms. Maxwell vigorously denies the charges, intends to fight them, and is entitled to the 
presumption of innocence. Far from "hiding," she has lived in the United States since 1991, has 
litigated civil cases arising from her supposed ties to Epstein, and has not left the country even 
once since Epstein's arrest a year ago, even though she was aware of the pending, and highly 
publicized, criminal investigation. She should be treated like any other defendant who comes 
before this Court, including as to bail. Under the Bail Reform Act, case law in this Circuit and 
other circuits, as well as decisions of this Court, Ms. Maxwell should be released on bail, subject 
to the strict conditions proposed below.

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 18 Filed 07/10/20 Page 6 of 26 
Background. Ms. Maxwell, 58, is a naturalized U.S. citizen who has resided in the 
United States since 1991. She is also a citizen of France, where she was born, and of the United 
Kingdom, where she was educated and spent her childhood and formative years. Ms. Maxwell 
graduated from Oxford University. She moved to the United States in 1991, and has lived in this 
country ever since that time. Ms. Maxwell has maintained extremely close relationships with her 
six siblings and her nephews and nieces. They all stood by her in the aftermath of the July 2019 
indictment of Epstein and continue to stand by her now. She is especially close to two of her 
sisters and their children, all of whom reside in the United States. Ms. Maxwell also has 
numerous friends in the United States who themselves have children, and she is a godmother to 
many of them. Ms. Maxwell's family and friends have remained committed to her because they 
do not believe the allegations against her, which do not match the person they have known for 
decades. 
The Government's Position. The government has the burden of persuasion in showing 
that detention is warranted, and that there are no conditions or combination of conditions that 
will secure a defendant's appearance in court. In seeking to carry this burden, the government 
relies on the presumption of detention in 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(3)(E), and argues that Ms. 
Maxwell poses a flight risk because she supposedly lacks ties to the United States; is a citizen of 
the United Kingdom and France, as well as a citizen of the United States, and has passports for 
each country; has traveled internationally in the past; and has financial means. And echoing 
recent media stories, the government speculates that Ms. Maxwell was "hiding" from law 
enforcement during the pendency of the investigation, even though she has been in regular 
contact with the government, through counsel, since Epstein's arrest. Finally, the government 
argues that the nature and circumstances of the offense and the weight of the evidence warrant 
EFTA00018520
--- PAGE 7 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 18 Filed 07/10/20 Page 7 of 26 
detention. Importantly, in contrast with the bail position it took with Epstein, the government 
does not and cannot assert that Ms. Maxwell presents a danger to the community under Section 
3142(g)(4). 
Ms. Maxwell's Response. The Court should exercise its discretion to grant bail to Ms. 
Maxwell, on the strict conditions proposed below (or as modified by the Court), for two 
compelling reasons. 
First, the COVID-19 crisis and its impact on detained defendants warrants release. As 
this Court has noted, the COVID-19 pandemic represents an unprecedented health risk to 
incarcerated individuals, and COVID-19-related restrictions on attorney communications with 
pretrial detainees significantly impair a defendant's ability to prepare her defense. Simply put, 
under these circumstances, if Ms. Maxwell continues to be detained, her health will be at serious 
risk and she will not be able to receive a fair trial. (See infra Section I, pages 5 to 9). 
Second, the Court should grant bail because the government has not met its burden under 
the Bail Reform Act and controlling case law. The presumption relied on by the government 
may be rebutted, and is so here. Ms. Maxwell has strong ties to the community: she is a U.S. 
citizen and has lived in this country for almost 30 years; she ran a non-profit company based in 
the United States until the recent media frenzy about this case forced her to wind it down to 
protect her professional colleagues and their organizations; and she has very close ties with 
family members and friends in New York and the rest of the country. Nor does her conduct 
indicate that she is a flight risk: she has no prior criminal record; has spent years contesting civil 
litigation arising from her supposed ties to Epstein; and has remained in the United States from 
the time of Epstein's arrest until the present, with her counsel in regular contact with the 
government. She did not flee, but rather left the public eye, for the entirely understandable 
EFTA00018521
--- PAGE 8 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 18 Filed 07/10/20 Page 8 of 26 
purpose of protecting herself and those close to her from the crush of media and online attention 
and its very real harms—those close to her have suffered the loss of jobs, work opportunities, 
and reputational damage simply for knowing her. The government's remaining arguments—
about Ms. Maxwell's passports, citizenship, travel and financial means— also fail because they 
would require that every defendant with multiple citizenship and financial means be denied bail, 
which is simply not the law. Finally, as discussed below, the government's position regarding 
the nature and circumstances of the offense and weight of its evidence, which relates to alleged 
conduct that is roughly twenty-five years old, is not persuasive and does not alter the bail 
analysis. (See infra Section II, pages 9 to 21). 
Proposed Bail Conditions. In light of the above, we propose the following bail 
conditions, which are consistent with those that courts in this Circuit have imposed in analogous 
situations: (i) a $5 million personal recognizance bond, co-signed by six financially responsible 
people, all of whom have strong ties to Ms. Maxwell, and secured by real property in the United 
Kingdom worth over $3.75 million; (ii) travel restricted to the Southern and Eastern Districts of 
New York; (iii) surrender of all travel documents with no new applications; (iv) strict 
supervision by Pretrial Services; (v) home confinement at a residence in the Southern District of 
New York with electronic GPS monitoring; (vi) visitors limited to Ms. Maxwell's immediate 
family, close friends and counsel; (vii) travel limited to Court appearances and to counsel's 
office, except upon application to Pretrial Services and the government; and (viii) such other 
terms as the Court may deem appropriate under Section 3142. 
The Bail Reform Act does not discard the presumption of innocence; Ms. Maxwell is 
entitled to that presumption here, as she is in all aspects of this case. See 18 U.S.C. § 3142(j) 
("Nothing in this section [3142] shall be construed as modifying or limiting the presumption of 
EFTA00018522
--- PAGE 9 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 18 Filed 07/10/20 Page 9 of 26 
innocence."). The government has failed to meet its burden of establishing that Ms. Maxwell 
presents an "actual risk of flight" and must be detained under Section 3142. The strict bail 
conditions outlined above are appropriate under the circumstances and are the "least restrictive" 
set of conditions that will "reasonably assure" Ms. Maxwell's appearance in Court, without the 
health and access to counsel risks inherent in the government's request that Ms. Maxwell be 
detained pending trial. See 18 U.S.C. § 3142 (c)(I)(B). Under the controlling legal standards, 
Ms. Maxwell should be released on bail. 
ARGUMENT 
There are two compelling reasons why the Court should order Ms. Maxwell's release 
on bail pursuant to the strict conditions she has proposed: 
First, Ms. Maxwell will be at significant risk of contracting COVID-19 if she is detained, 
and she will not be able to meaningfully participate in the preparation of her defense due to the 
restrictions that have been placed on attorney visits and phone calls in light of the pandemic. 
Second, the government has failed to cany its burden under 18 U.S.C. § 3142 that no 
combination of conditions can be imposed that will reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell's presence in 
court. 
I. 
The Conditions Created by the COVID-19 Pandemic Mandate the Release of 
Ms. Maxwell. 
Impact of COVID-I 9 on the Prison Population. We submit that the conditions created by 
the COVID-19 pandemic compel Ms. Maxwell's release pursuant to appropriate bail conditions. 
Four months ago, this Court held in United States v. Stephens, 15-CR-95 (AJN), 2020 WL 
1295155 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 19, 2020), that COVID-19 is an "unprecedented and extraordinarily 
dangerous" threat that justifies release on bail. Id. at *2. In that case, the defendant, who had no 
underlying medical conditions, filed an emergency motion for reconsideration of the Court's 
EFTA00018523
--- PAGE 10 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 18 Filed 07/10/20 Page 10 of 26 
prior detention order based in part on the risks brought on by COVID-19. At the time, COVID-
had only begun to take its devastating toll on New York, and there was no known outbreak in 
the prison population. Nevertheless, the Court noted that "inmates may be at a heightened risk of 
contracting COVID-19 should an outbreak develop," and, based in part on this changed 
circumstance, ordered the defendant released. Id. 
Since the Court issued its opinion in Stephens, the COVID-19 risks to inmates have 
increased dramatically, as there have been significant outbreaks of COVID-19 in correctional 
facilities. In the last month alone, the number of prison inmates known to have COVID-19 has 
doubled to 68,000, and prison deaths tied to COVID-19 have increased by 73 percent.' Indeed, 
as of July 2, 2020, nine of the ten largest known clusters of the coronavirus in the United States 
are in federal prisons and county jails.2 As this Court noted last month, "the `inability [of] 
individuals to socially distance, shared communal spaces, and limited access to hygiene 
products' [in correctional facilities] make community spread all but unavoidable." United States 
v. Williams-Bethea, No. 18-CR-78 (AJN), 2020 WL 2848098, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. June 2, 2020) 
(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The risks are further enhanced by the possibility 
of a second wave of coronavirus cases.;
In particular, COVID-19 has begun to spread through the Metropolitan Detention Center 
(MDC), where Ms. Maxwell has been housed since the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) transferred her 
there on July 6, 2020. According to the MDC's statistics, as of April 3, 2020, two inmates and

five staff had tested positive; by June 30, 2020, those numbers had risen to 14 and 41, 
respectively.4 The increased spread among prisons means that the COVID-19 risks that were 
present in the Stephens case four months ago are far more serious for Ms. Maxwell now and 
mandate her release. 
Impact of COVID-I 9 on the Ability to Prepare the Defense. The Stephens opinion 
provides yet another independent basis that, we submit, requires Ms. Maxwell's release: if she is 
detained, her ability to meet with her attorneys and prepare for her defense will be significantly 
impaired and she will not be able to meaningfully participate in the preparation of her defense. 
In Stephens, the Court found that this factor required the defendant's release under 18 
U.S.C. § 3142(i), which provides for temporary release based on a determination that such 
release is "necessary for preparation of the person's defense." Stephens, 2020 WL 1295155 at 
*3. The Court noted that the spread of COVID-19 had compelled the BOP to suspend all in-
person visits, including legal visits, except as allowed on a case-by-case basis. Id. at *3. That 
suspension persists to this day.5 In a case such as this, which will require assessing evidence 
relating to events that occurred approximately twenty-five years ago, including documents and 
personal recollections, numerous in-person meetings between counsel and Ms. Maxwell will be 
critical to the preparation of the defense. The recent resurgence of the pandemic calls into 
question whether these meetings will ever be able to happen in advance of her trial. As in

Stephens, Ms. Maxwell's inability to meet with her attorneys while this policy is in effect 
constitutes a "compelling reason" requiring her release. Stephens, 2020 WL 1295155 at *3.6
Even speaking by phone with Ms. Maxwell presents daunting challenges due to COVID-
19-related protocols requiring at least 72 hours' notice to schedule a call, unless it is urgent, in 
which case counsel can email a request to the MDC. As counsel learned this past week, 
however, even an urgent call request does not mean the call will take place in the time required. 
At approximately 5:30 p.m. on July 6, 2020, the Court ordered us to confer with Ms. Maxwell 
about waiving her physical presence at the arraignment, initial appearance, and bail hearing, and 
ordered counsel for both sides to jointly report back by 9:00 p.m. that night with a proposed date 
and time for these proceedings. We promptly emailed the MDC to request an urgent call, 
making specific reference to the Court's Order, but were not connected with Ms. Maxwell until 
9:00 p.m. There will no doubt be other orders of the Court with no guarantees we will be able to 
reach our client in time if she is detained.' In addition, during this past week, Ms. Maxwell has 
not been able to physically review documents and has had limited access to writing materials. 
The prohibition on in-person visits means we must read to her any documents requiring her 
review, and she has virtually no ability to take notes. The age of the allegations in this case 
compound these problems. Under the current circumstances, Ms. Maxwell cannot review 
Since the Court issued its opinion in Stephens, numerous other courts in this District have ordered defendants 
released on bail, over the government's objection, due to the pandemic and its impact on the defendant's ability to 
prepare for trial. See, e.g., United States v. Carrillo-Villa, 20-MJ-3073 (SLC) (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 6, 2020) (releasing 
undocumented defendant in drug conspiracy case because of inability to meaningfully communicate with lawyer and 
risk of COVID-19); United States v. Hudson, 19-CR-496 (CM) (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 19, 2020) (releasing defendant in 
drug conspiracy, loansharking, and extortion case, whose two prior, pre-COVID-I9 bail applications were denied, 
because of inability to prepare for upcoming trial and risk of COVID-19); United States v. Chandler, 19-CR-867 
(PAC), 2020 WL 1528120, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 2020) (releasing defendant on felon in possession case, with 
prior manslaughter conviction, due to inability to prepare for trial due to COVID-19 restrictions). 
The government has recently worked with the BOP to set up a standing call between counsel and Ms. Maxwell 
each morning until the initial appearance to facilitate attorney-client communications. While we greatly appreciate 
these efforts, they are a short-term patch to a persistent problem that shows no signs of abating. Nor would it be 
appropriate, on an ongoing basis, for the prosecutors to be involved in and dictate the date and time of our 
communications with our client in connection with the preparation of our defense.

documents and other evidence from approximately twenty-five years ago and meaningfully assist 
in the preparation of her defense. These restrictions are additional "compelling reasons" 
justifying her release. See id.8
II. 
The Government Has Not Carried Its Burden Under 18 U.S.C. § 3142. 
The grave concerns raised by the current COVID-19 crisis notwithstanding, Ms. Maxwell 
must be released because she has met her limited burden of production showing that she does not 
pose a flight risk, and the government has entirely failed to demonstrate that no release condition 
or combination of conditions exist that will reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell's presence in court. 
A. 
Applicable Law 
As the Supreme Court has recognized, "[i]n our society liberty is the norm, and detention 
prior to trial or without trial is the carefully limited exception." United States v. Salerno, 481 
U.S. 739, 755 (1987). Pretrial detention is appropriate only where "no condition or combination 
of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the [defendant]." United States v. 
Sabhnani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2007) (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)). The Bail Reform Act 
provides that a court "shall order the pretrial release" of the defendant (18 U.S.C. § 3142(b)) 
(emphasis added), but may impose bail conditions if "such release will not reasonably assure the 
appearance" of the defendant in court. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(c). Where conditions are necessary, 
such release shall be "subject to the least restrictive . . . set of conditions that [the court] 
determines will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required." 18 U.S.C. § 
3142(c)(1)(B) (emphasis added). Consequently, "[u]nder this statutory scheme, `it is only a 
limited group of offenders who should be denied bail pending trial."' Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75 
(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). 
See also Letter of Sean Hecker to Hon. Margo K. Brodie (July 8, 2020), Federal Defenders of New York, Inc. v. 
Federal Bureau of Prisons, et at, No. 19 Civ. 660 (E.D.N.Y.) (Doc. No. 78) (detailing absence of in-person 
visitation, highly limited VTC and telephone call capacity, and issues pertaining to legal mail and legal documents). 
EFTA00018527
--- PAGE 14 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 18 Filed 07/10/20 Page 14 of 26 
The government bears a dual burden in seeking pre-trial detention. First, the government 
must show "by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant ... presents an actual risk of 
flight." Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75 (emphasis added). If the government is able to satisfy this 
burden, it must then "demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that no condition or 
combination of conditions could be imposed on the defendant that would reasonably assure his 
presence in court." Id. 
In determining whether there are conditions of release that will reasonably assure the 
appearance of the defendant, the court must consider (1) the nature and circumstances of the 
offense charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person; (3) the history and 
characteristics of the person; and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to any person or 
the community that would be posed by the person's release. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g). 
In this case, unlike in the Epstein case, the government does not contend that Ms. 
Maxwell poses any danger to the community, and therefore the fourth factor does not apply. 
The Bail Reform Act contains a rebuttable presumption, applicable based on certain of 
the crimes charged here, that no conditions will reasonably assure against flight. See 18 U.S.C. § 
I42(e)(3)(E). In cases where this presumption applies, the "defendant bears a limited burden of 
production—not a burden of persuasion—to rebut that presumption by coming forward with 
evidence that [she] does not pose ... a risk of flight." See United States v. English, 629 F.3d 
311, 319 (2d Cir. 2011) (quotation omitted). This rebuttable presumption can be readily 
satisfied, United States v. Conway, No. 4-11-70756 MAG (DMR), 2011 WL 3421321, at *2 
(N.D. Cal. Aug. 3, 2011), and "[a]ny evidence favorable to a defendant that comes within a 
category listed in § 3142(g) can affect the operation" of the presumption. United States v. 
Dominguez, 783 F.2d 702, 707 (7th Cir. 1986); see also United States v. Mattis, No. 20-1713, 
EFTA00018528
--- PAGE 15 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 18 Filed 07/10/20 Page 15 of 26 
2020 WL 3536277, at *4-5 (2d Cir. June 30, 2020). Although the presumption "remains a factor 
to be considered" even after the defendant has met her burden of production, "[a]t all times ... 
the government retains the ultimate burden of persuasion by ... a preponderance of the 
evidence" that the defendant poses a flight risk that cannot be addressed by any bail conditions. 
English, 629 F.3d at 319 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); see also United States 
v. Deutsch, No. I 8-CR-502 (FB), 2020 WL 3577398, at *5 (E.D.N.Y. July I, 2020). And 
regardless of the presence of the presumption or the nature of the charges alleged, "[n]othing in 
this section [3142] shall be construed as modifying or limiting the presumption of innocence." 
U.S.C. § 31420); see also United States v. Crowell, No. 06-CR-291E(F), 2006 WL 3541736, 
at *3 (W.D.N.Y. Dec. 7, 2006) (those charged with crimes involving minors "continue to enjoy 
the presumption of innocence in setting conditions of release."). 
B. 
Ms. Maxwell Has Rebutted the Presumption That She Poses a Flight 
Risk, and the Government Has Not Carried Its Burden That No 
Combination of Conditions Can Be Imposed To Reasonably Assure Her 
Presence In Court 
The government has not carried its burden of establishing that no set of conditions 
will reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell's appearance in court. As set forth below, Ms. 
Maxwell's personal history, her family and other ties to this country, and her conduct prior 
to her arrest easily rebut the presumption that she presents a risk of flight. For these same 
reasons, the government cannot establish that the strict bail conditions she proposes, which 
are consistent with a number of cases in this Circuit in which courts have ordered release, 
will not "reasonably assure" her presence in court. Accordingly, the Court should order Ms. 
Maxwell released pursuant to her proposed conditions.

1. 
Ms. Maxwell's Personal History and Characteristics 
Demonstrate That She Is Not a Flight Risk 
a. 
Ms. Maxwell Has No Prior Criminal Record, and Has 
Significant Ties to the United States and the New York Region 
Ms. Maxwell's history and characteristics do not "strongly support detention," as the 
government contends (Gov. Mem. at 6), but instead demonstrate that she is firmly rooted in 
this country and that her appearance can be reasonably assured with appropriate bail 
conditions. Ms. Maxwell has no criminal record, which includes the approximately twenty-
five-year period from the time the conduct alleged in the indictment took place to the 
present. Ms. Maxwell also has significant ties to the United States. She has lived in this 
country for almost 30 years and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2002. Ms. Maxwell 
also has strong family ties to this country. Two of her sisters, who have agreed to co-sign 
her bond, live in the United States, and they have several children who are U.S.-born 
citizens. Ms. Maxwell is very close with her sisters and maintains regular contact with 
them, as well as with her nieces and nephews. Ms. Maxwell also has numerous close 
friends and professional colleagues who reside in this country. In sum, the United States has 
been Ms. Maxwell's home for decades. 
b. 
Ms. Maxwell Has Actively Litigated Civil Cases in this District 
and Has Not Left the United States Since Epstein's 2019 Arrest 
Ms. Maxwell has never once attempted to "hide" from the government or her 
accusers, and has never shown any intent to leave the country. To the contrary, Ms. 
Maxwell has always vehemently denied that she was involved in illegal or improper conduct 
related to Epstein, and her conduct has been entirely consistent with someone who fully 
intends to remain in this country and fight any allegations brought against her. For example, 
since 2015, and continuing through today, Ms. Maxwell has actively litigated several civil 
EFTA00018530
--- PAGE 17 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 18 Filed 07/10/20 Page 17 of 26 
cases related to Epstein in the Southern District of New York and has sat for depositions in 
those cases. Similarly, throughout the course of the criminal investigation of this case, 
which has been publicly reported on for nearly a year, Ms. Maxwell has remained in the 
United States. Indeed, on July 7, 2019, the day after Epstein's arrest, Ms. Maxwell reached 
out to the prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, through counsel, and 
maintained regular contact with them right up to the point of her arrest. 
The government's broad assertion that Ms. Maxwell has engaged in "frequent 
international travel" in the last three years (Gov. Mem. at 6) obscures the critical point: she 
has not left the country even once since Epstein's arrest. Ms. Maxwell's decision to remain 
in the United States after Epstein's arrest and subsequent death in August 2019 is 
particularly significant because any incentive she may have had to flee would have been 
even more acute at that time. Within days of Epstein's death, a steady stream of press 
articles began turning the public's attention to Ms. Maxwell—wrongly substituting her for 
Epstein—and speculating that she had become the prime target of the government's 
investigation.9 Adding even more fuel to this fire, several of the women claiming to be 
victims of Epstein's abuse began publicly calling for her immediate arrest and prosecution. 
Despite the increasing risk of being criminally charged, and the media firestorm that was 
redirected toward her after Epstein's death, and despite having ample opportunity to leave 
the country, Ms. Maxwell stayed in the United States for almost an entire year until she was 
arrested. These actions weigh heavily in favor of release. See United States v. Friedman,

837 F.2d 48, 49-50 (2d Cir. 1988) (overturning district court's decision that defendant posed 
a flight risk based in part on the ground that the defendant took "no steps" to flee 
jurisdiction in three-week period between execution of search warrant at home and arrest); 
United States v. DiGiacomo, 746 F. Supp. 1176, 1179-80 (D. Mass. 1990) (concluding 
defendants did not present a flight risk because each of them "for three years knew there 
was substantial evidence of the likely charges against them and did not attempt to flee 
before indictment"). 
Indeed, the absence of any allegation by the government that Ms. Maxwell was 
taking steps to leave the country at the time of her arrest is conspicuous. The government 
has offered no proof that she was making plans to leave the country. In fact, had the 
government alerted her counsel that she was about to be arrested, we would have arranged 
for Ms. Maxwell's prompt, voluntary surrender. Instead, the government arrested Ms. 
Maxwell without warning on the day before the July 4th holiday, thus ensuring that she 
would be in federal custody on the one-year anniversary of Epstein's arrest.

Ms. Maxwell's Actions to Protect Herself From Intrusive Media 
Coverage and Death Threats Do Not Demonstrate an Intent to 
Flee 
Furthermore, the steps Ms. Maxwell took to leave the public eye after Epstein's 
arrest are not indicative of a risk of flight. The government notes that Ms. Maxwell dropped 
out of public view after Epstein's arrest, which the government seeks to portray as "hiding" 
from the law. The government further argues that she has taken several steps to avoid 
detection, including moving residences and switching her phone and email address. (Gov. 
Mem. at 8). But Ms. Maxwell did not take these steps to hide from law enforcement or 
evade prosecution. Instead, they were necessary measures that Ms. Maxwell was forced to

take to protect herself, her family members, her friends and colleagues, and their children, 
from unrelenting and intrusive media coverage, threats, and irreparable reputational harm. 
Ever since Epstein's arrest, Ms. Maxwell has been at the center of a crushing 
onslaught of press articles, television specials, and social media posts painting her in the 
most damning light possible and prejudging her guilt. The sheer volume of media reporting 
mentioning Ms. Maxwell is staggering. Since Epstein's arrest, she has been mentioned in 
literally thousands of media publications, news reports, and other online content. The media 
attention also spawned a carnival-like atmosphere of speculation about her whereabouts. In 
November 2019, the British tabloid, The Sun, even offered a £10,000 bounty for information 
about Ms. Maxwell's location. A headline reminiscent of a Wild West wanted poster read: 
"WANTED: The Sun is offering a £10,000 reward for information on Jeffrey Epstein pal 
Ghislaine Maxwell."10 And in the days leading up to her arrest, there was a deluge of media 
reports (all untrue) claiming that Ms. Maxwell was hiding out in an apartment in Paris to avoid 
questioning by the FBI." She has seen helicopters flying over her home and reporters hiding in 
the bushes. Indeed, since Ms. Maxwell's arrest on July 2, 2020, her counsel has been flooded 
with hundreds of media inquiries and solicitations from members of the public. 
The "open season" declared on Ms. Maxwell after Epstein's death has come with an 
even darker cost - she has been the target of alarming physical threats, even death threats, and 
has had to hire security guards to ensure her safety. The media feeding frenzy, which has only 
intensified in recent months, has also deeply affected her family and friends. Some of Ms. 
Maxwell's closest friends who had nothing whatsoever to do with Epstein have lost their jobs or

suffered severe professional and reputational damage simply by being associated with her. Ms. 
Maxwell therefore did what any responsible person would do — she separated herself from 
everyone she cares about and removed herself from the public eye in order to keep herself and 
her friends out of harm's way.12
Lacking any evidence required under the governing standard that Ms. Maxwell 
presents an "actual risk of flight," Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75, the government's flight risk 
argument is reduced to the following: Ms. Maxwell is a woman of means who has foreign 
citizenship and has traveled internationally in the past, and who now faces serious charges. 
But if that were sufficient, then virtually every defendant with a foreign passport and any 
meaningful amount of funds would need to be detained as a flight risk. See Hung v. United 
States 439 U.S. 1326, 1329 (1978) (to detain based on risk of flight, government must show 
more than "opportunities for flight," and instead must establish an "inclination on the part of 
[the defendant] to flee"). That is not what the Bail Reform Act requires. Indeed, courts in 
this Circuit and elsewhere commonly find that bail conditions can adequately address risk of 
flight, even where individuals have foreign citizenship and passports or otherwise substantial 
foreign connections, and financial means. See, e.g., Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 66; United States v. 
Hansen, 108 F. App'x 331 (6th Cir. 2004); United States v. Hanson, 613 F. Supp. 2d 85 (D.D.C. 
2009); United States v. Bodmer, No. 03-cr-947(SAS), 2004 WL 169790, at *2-3 (S.D.N.Y. 
Jan. 28. 2004); United States v. Karni, 298 F. Supp. 2d 129 (D.D.C. 2004); United States v. 
Kashoggi, 717 F. Supp. 1048, 1050-52 (S.D.N.Y. 1989). 
Finally, the ongoing travel restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic would 
pose a significant hurdle to Ms. Maxwell's ability to flee the United States, particularly to 
The media spotlight has also drawn out people who claim to speak for Ms. Maxwell, and even purport to have had 
direct communications with her, but who, in fact, have no ties to Ms. Maxwell whatsoever. One such person has 
even given numerous television interviews on news shows in the United Kingdom.

France and the United Kingdom.13 Notably, two weeks ago, this Court recognized in United 
States v. Abdellatif El Mokadem, No. 19-CR-646 (AJN), 2020 WL 3440515 (S.D.N.Y. June 
23, 2020) that "concerns regarding risk of flight are mitigated by the ongoing [COVID-19] 
pandemic, which has understandably curtailed travel across the country, and, indeed, around 
the world." Id. at *1. In that case, despite finding detention to be warranted on two prior 
occasions, the Court concluded that the government could no longer establish flight risk and 
ordered the defendant released pending sentencing. Id. ("Taking account of the COVID-19 
pandemic, which had not yet reached this country when the Court last considered 
Defendant's custody status, the balance now clearly and convincingly tips in Defendant's 
favor . . . ."). Consideration of this factor weighs heavily in favor of release on the proposed 
bail conditions here. 
2. 
The Nature and Circumstances of the Charges and the 
Weight of the Evidence Militate in Favor of Bail 
The Defense Has Rebutted the Presumption Relating to Certain of the Charges. The 
government relies on the statutory presumption of detention applicable to offenses involving 
minor victims. (Gov. Mem. at 4-5.) But unlike the position it took with Epstein, the 
government does not contend that Ms. Maxwell poses any danger to the community, or that 
she suffers from compulsive or addictive sexual proclivities. See United States v. Epstein, 
425 F. Supp. 3d 306, 314-15 (S.D.N.Y. 2019). Even according to the indictment, Ms. 
Maxwell's alleged participation in offenses involving minors ended in 1997. Here, the only

European Union will not open its borders to travelers from the United States, and "[t]ravelers' country of residence, 
not their nationality, will be the determining factor for their ability to travel to countries in the European Union");

England will leave mandatory 14-day quarantine restrictions in place for travelers coming from the United States). 
EFTA00018535
--- PAGE 22 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 18 Filed 07/10/20 Page 22 of 26 
applicable presumption relates to risk of flight, and, as noted, Ms. Maxwell has rebutted that 
presumption based on her ties to the United States, her decision to remain in this country 
after Epstein's arrest, and all of the other reasons discussed above. This Court should follow 
other courts in this Circuit and elsewhere that have found that defendants rebutted the 
presumption and imposed appropriately strict bail conditions in cases involving alleged 
offenses against minors. See Deutsch, 2020 WL 3577398, at *5-6; United States v. Veres, 
No. 3:20-CR-18-J-32JBT, 2020 WL 1042051, at *3-4 (M.D. Fla. Mar. 4, 2020); Conway, 
2011 WL 3421321, at *4-5. 
The Impact of the Potential Penalties Is Overstated. The government asserts that 
detention is warranted because of the potential for a long sentence in this case. (Gov. Mem. 
at 4-5.) This oversimplifies the governing standard. Although the severity of potential 
punishment is a relevant consideration, the Second Circuit "require[s] more than evidence of 
the commission of a serious crime and the fact of a potentially long sentence to support a 
finding of risk of flight." Friedman, 837 F.2d at 49-50 (district court's finding that 
defendant posed a risk of flight was clearly erroneous, despite potential for "long sentence 
of incarceration"); see also Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 65, 76-77 (reversing detention order 
where defendants agreed to significant physical and financial restrictions, despite the fact 
that they faced a "lengthy term of incarceration"). Accordingly, the asserted potential for a 
long sentence does not meet the government's burden of persuasion.14
The government relies on United States v. Alindato-Perez, 627 F. Supp. 2d 58, 66 (D.P.R. 2009), cited 
approvingly by United States v. Moscaritolo, No. 10 Cr. 4 (JL), 2010 WL 309679, at •2 (D.N.H. Jan. 26, 2010) for 
the proposition that "[t]he steeper the potential sentence, the more probable the flight risk is, especially considering 
the strong case of the government ...." (Gov. Mem. at 5.) But Alindato-Perez is easily distinguished on its facts 
from Ms. Maxwell's case. Alindato-Perez was a narcotics case that did not involve 20-year old conduct as here, but 
instead involved a conspiracy that "continu[ed] until the date of the indictment." 627 F. Supp. 2d at 60-61. The 
evidence included eleven "clearly incriminating video tapes" and testimony from various cooperating witnesses, and 
the defendant faced a 10-year mandatory minimum sentence. Id. at 61-64. These factors are not present in this case. 
EFTA00018536
--- PAGE 23 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 18 Filed 07/10/20 Page 23 of 26 
Moreover, the government overstates the potential for Ms. Maxwell to spend 
"decades in prison" if she is convicted. (Gov. Mem. at 5.) In fact, her likely total exposure 
even if she were convicted on all counts is 10 years, assuming the Court were to follow the 
traditional practice in this District and impose concurrent sentences. Although a 10-year 
sentence would be significant, it is a far cry from the government's forecast, further 
demonstrating that the government has not met its burden of showing Ms. Maxwell is an 
actual risk of flight. 
The Government's Case Is Subject to Significant Challenges. In evaluating the 
strength of the government's case, we note that Ms. Maxwell intends to mount several legal 
challenges to the indictment, including that: (i) this prosecution is barred by Epstein's 
September 24, 2007 non-prosecution agreement with the Department of Justice, which 
covers "any potential co-conspirators of Epstein"; (ii) the conspiracy, enticement of minors, 
and transporting of minors charges are time-barred and otherwise legally flawed; and (iii) 
the two perjury charges are subject to dismissal on several legal grounds." In addition, as 
we understand from the face of the indictment, the government's case is based primarily on 
the testimony of three individuals about events that allegedly occurred roughly 25 years ago 
between 1994 and 1997. It is inherently more difficult to prosecute cases relating to 
decades-old conduct. These issues further call into question the strength of the government's 
case, and provide an independent basis justifying release on bail. 
1S The defense is also considering whether the government's comments in connection with this case conform to 
Local Criminal Rule 23.1, and whether to seek appropriate relief from the Court.

3. 
The Proposed Bail Package Is More Than 
Adequate to Secure Ms. Maxwell's Presence 
For the reasons stated above, the Court should release Ms. Maxwell because the 
circumstances created by the COVID-19 pandemic will greatly increase her personal risk 
and prevent her from meaningfully participating in her defense, and because the government 
has not carried its burden under 18 U.S.C. § 3142. We respectfully submit that the proposed 
bail package represents the "least restrictive" set of conditions that will reasonably ensure Ms. 
Maxwell's presence in court. 18 U.S.C. § 3142 (c)(1)(B). 
The package includes six co-signers-Ms. Maxwell's siblings, relatives and 
friends—many of whom reside in the United States, and all of whom continue to support her 
despite the unrelenting media attacks that Ms. Maxwell and they, themselves, have suffered 
as a result of this case. Each of them has voluntarily agreed to assume responsibility for an 
extremely large bond amount of $5 million, in order to secure her appearance. The bond is 
also to be secured by real property in the United Kingdom worth roughly $3.75 million. 
The package also includes stringent travel and physical restrictions, including surrendering 
all passports and no new travel applications, travel restricted to the Southern and Eastern 
Districts of New York, and home detention with electronic GPS monitoring. Ms. Maxwell, 
for personal reasons, will continue to need security guards to protect her upon release. 
Under the circumstances, if the Court requires it, the security guards could report to Pretrial 
Services.16
In United States v. Houston!, 932 F.3d 79 (2d Cir. 2019), the Second Circuit curtailed the circumstances under 
which a court can grant pretrial release to a defendant on the condition that the defendant pays for private armed 
security guards. Houston!, nevertheless, held that a defendant may be released on such a condition if the defendant 
"is deemed to be a flight risk primarily because ofhis wealth. In other words, a defendant may be released on such a 
condition only where, but for his wealth, he would not have been detained." Id. (emphasis in original). We submit 
that a similarly situated defendant who, like Ms. Maxwell, had no prior criminal record, significant ties to the United 
States, and a demonstrated lack of intent to flee the country, as well as numerous, supportive co-signers, but who did 
EFTA00018538
--- PAGE 25 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 18 Filed 07/10/20 Page 25 of 26 
Ms. Maxwell has a number of other family members and friends who, under normal 
circumstances, would also co-sign and secure her bond. She is not relying on them in 
connection with this bail application in an effort to safeguard their privacy and protect them 
and their families from harm. 
The proposed bail conditions are consistent with those approved by courts in this 
Circuit in other high-profile cases, and should be approved here. See, e.g., United States v. 
Esposito, 309 F. Supp. 3d 24, 32 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (alleged leader of Genovese crime family 
who was charged with racketeering and extortion granted release subject to conditions), 
aff'd, 749 F. App'x 20 (2d Cir. 2018); United States v. Dreier, 596 F. Supp. 2d 831, 832 
(S.D.N.Y. 2009) (Marc Dreier, accused of "colossal criminality" and alleged to be a "high 
flight risk," granted release subject to conditions); United States v. Madoff, 586 F. Supp. 2d 
240, 243 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (Bernie Madoff, charged with "largest Ponzi scheme ever and 
alleged to be a "serious risk of flight," granted release subject to conditions). 
not have Ms. Maxwell's means, would be released on bail conditions. Accordingly, if the Court deems it necessary, 
it may impose private security guards as a condition of release.

For the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that the Court order her 
release on bail pursuant to the conditions she has proposed.

Charged Cases 
U.S. v. Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN): This summer, we charged Ghislaine Maxwell with 
conspiring to entice minors to travel for the purpose of sexual abuse in connection with helping 
Jeffrey Epstein to abuse his many victims. The case focused on three specific victims that 
traveled to be abused by Epstein, including instances in which Maxwell herself participated in 
the acts of abuse. Trial is set for this coming July. We are finishing discovery, and motions are 
scheduled for December. Motion practice could generate further press; for example, the 
defendant continues to press for the identity of the specific victims, and if she is successful, that 
would surely lead to a round of press about the victims and the details of our case. Relafiill i we 
are in plea negotiations with counsel for
 another Epstein co-conspirator. 
who scheduled hundreds of sexual massages with minors for Epstein but was also a victim of his 
sexual abuse, may plead to an obstruction of justice-related count.

Subject: update 
Good afternoon, 
I am writing because my trial which was supposed to begin today has been moved to March 3rd. I asked the Court 
(EDNY) for March 4th off so I would be able to attend the status conference for Mr. Tartaglione and I explained briefly 
that there was a Curcio issue. That application was denied. 
So, I am wondering if you will be requesting more time to continue to review material and presumably get input from 
our firm. If so, then it may make sense to adjourn the conference. If you don't need more time, then I may make 
another request or ask Judge Karas to help. I don't think there is much else that will be done next week other than 
address the Curcio issue. 
Thank you.

FYI: state authorities in New Mexico are moving forward with their own plans with respect to the Epstein property. 
Yesterday the state land commissioner revoked leases held by Cypress Inc. 
https://www.abqjournal.com/1362185/land-commissioner-voids-epsteins-nm-grazing-leases.html 
The linked news coverage quotes the New Mexico Attorney General as saying that he is conducting a criminal 
investigation at the state level "in coordination with" the SDNY. Here are a few sentences from late in the article: 
The [State] Attorney General's Office is investigating whether crimes took place on Zorro Ranch. [State Land 
Commissioner Stephanie] Garcia Richard said Wednesday her office had notified [State] Attorney General 
Hector Balderas to provide notice if any criminal activity was found to have occurred on the trust land leased by 
EFTA00018553
--- PAGE 2 ---
Epstein "because we were looking for a reason to cancel these leases and criminal activity would have given us 
the perfect reason." 
Balderas did issue a statement saying he was pleased Garcia Richard was "taking back lands that should be 
managed to best serve the State and for the benefit of New Mexico school children." Public schools are one 
beneficiary of state trust land revenue. Balderas added: "We continue to investigate this matter at the state level 
in coordination with U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York."

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 37 Filed 07/30/20 FAn I of 
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
United States of America, 
—v—
Ghislaine Maxwell, 
Defendant. 
IISDC SDNY 
DOCUMENT 
ELECTRONICALLY PILED 
DOC 0. 
DATE FILED:7/30/2020 
20-CR-330 (MN) 
MEMORANDUM 
OPINION & ORDER 
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
Both parties have asked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on 
most of the language, two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language 
allowing her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on the public 
record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein. 
Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential Government witnesses and their 
counsel from using discovery materials for any purpose other than preparing for the criminal trial 
in this action. The Government has proposed contrary language on both of these issues. For the 
following reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order. 
Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16(d)(1), "[a]t any time the court may, for 
good cause, deny, restrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relief." 
The good cause standard "requires courts to balance several interests, including whether 
dissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others . . . whether the imposition of 
the protective order would prejudice the defendant," and "the public's interest in the 
information." United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 506, 522 (S.D.N.Y. 2013). The party 
seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of showing good cause. Cl Gambale v. Deutsche 
Bank AG, 377 F.3d 133, 142 (2d Cir. 2004). 
EFTA00018562
--- PAGE 2 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 37 Filed 07/30/20 Page 2 of 3 
First, the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of showing good cause with 
regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged victims and 
witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this litigation. As a 
general matter, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific interest in protecting the 
privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that supports restricting the disclosure of 
their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknowledging that as a baseline the protective order should 
"prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense counsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or 
disseminating the identity of any alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery 
materials"); see also United States v. Corley, No. 13-cr-48, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 194426, at 
*11 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 15, 2016). The Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished for 
individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, because 
they have voluntarily chosen to identify themselves. But not all accusations or public statements 
are equal. Deciding to participate in or contribute to a criminal investigation or prosecution is a 
far different matter than simply making a public statement "relating to" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey 
Epstein, particularly since such a statement might have occurred decades ago and have no 
relevance to the charges in this case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy 
interest that must be safeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks 
undermining the protections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by 
law. In contrast, the Government's proffered language would allow Ms. Maxwell to publicly 
reference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also allows the 
Defense to "referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be relevant .. . to Potential 
Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the investigation and preparation of the 
defense case at trial." Dkt. No. 33-1, ¶ 5. This proposal adequately balances the interests at 
EFTA00018563
--- PAGE 3 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 37 Filed 07/30/20 Page 3 of 3 
stake. And as the Government's letter notes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense 
needs an exception to the protective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make 
applications to the Court on a case-by-case basis. 
Second, restrictions on the ability of potential witnesses and their counsel to use 
discovery materials for purposes other than preparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The 
request appears unprecedented despite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal 
matters that had related civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions 
including Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of 1974, and 
other policies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern 
District of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously follow. 
Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential witnesses with 
materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt. No. 33 at 6. And of 
course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to examination on the record as to 
what materials were provided or shown to them by the Government. Nothing in the Defense's 
papers explains how its unprecedented proposed restriction is somehow necessary to ensure a 
fair trial. 
For the foregoing reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, 
which will be entered on the docket. 
This resolves Dkt. No. 29. 
SO ORDERED.

I'm still having the issue. The appendix (the last 30 pages or so) is searchable, but the report (the first 370+ pages) isn't. 
So, for example, if you CTRL+F "Epstein" the first hit I get is on page 384, even though he is repeatedly referred to in the 
first 370+ pages.

United States District Court 
Southern District of New York 
United States Courthouse 
New York, New York 10007 
Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
NUN York NY 10022 
.1 212 957 7600 phone 
nvoacclaenTesser corn 
On behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we respectfully submit this letter motion 
seeking the Court's assistance with two critical issues that greatly impact Ms. Maxwell's ability 
to receive a fair trial on the schedule set by the Court. First, we request that the Court enter an 
order directing the government to disclose to defense counsel the identities of the three alleged 
victims referenced in the indictment ("Victims 1-3"), subject to the restrictions of the protective 
order entered by the Court, so that Ms. Maxwell and defense counsel can meaningfully 
investigate the alleged conduct, which is now over 25 years old. Second, we request that the 
Court enter an order directing the Bureau of Prisons ("BOP") to release Ms. Maxwell into the 
general population and provide Ms. Maxwell with increased access to the discovery materials 
while she is detained so that she can meaningfully participate in the preparation of her defense. 
1. 
Disclosure of Victim Identities 
The Court should order the government to disclose the identities of Victims 1-3 to 
defense counsel, subject to the restrictions of the protective order, because Ms. Maxwell cannot 
prepare for or receive a fair trial without this information. Moreover, the requested disclosure is 
authorized under the law in this Circuit, and is narrowly-tailored and reasonable under the 
circumstances of this case. 
Here, it is clear from the face of the indictment that the government's case is based on the 
accounts of Victims 1-3, the three individuals specifically referenced in the indictment. It is 
therefore critical for the defense to know the names of these individuals as soon as possible, so

The Honorable Alison J. Nathan

Page 2 
that we can mount an effective defense investigation and adequately prepare for trial. This is 
especially true in this case where the alleged misconduct took place on unspecified dates roughly 
years ago in multiple locations—namely, New York, Florida, New Mexico, and the United 
Kingdom—and where the central figure, Jeffrey Epstein, is alleged to have engaged in 
misconduct with dozens, if not hundreds, of alleged victims. The defense should not have to 
speculate which of these individuals are Victims 1-3 referenced in the indictment. 
It is now almost six weeks since Ms. Maxwell's arrest, and the government is just now 
beginning to produce Rule 16 discovery, despite confirming to the Court that discovery would 
begin as soon as the Court entered a protective order. Moreover, the government still has not 
confirmed to the defense the identities of Victims 1-3. Ms. Maxwell was arrested on July 2, 
2020. On July 14, 2020, during her arraignment and bail hearing, the government indicated that 
it had "begun preparing an initial production" and would be "prepared to produce a first batch of 
discovery as soon as a protective order [was] entered by the Court."' The Court entered the 
protective order on July 30, 2020. (Dkt. 36). The following day, July 31, 2020, defense counsel 
contacted the government and requested disclosure of the identities of Victims 1-3. 
The 
government refused to do so, stating that it would only disclose the identities of alleged victims 
through its production of Rule 16 discovery, or as part of its production of Jencks Act material 
closer to trial. That same day, per the government's request, the defense provided a hard drive to 
load the Rule 16 discovery. However, the government did not make its first production until 
after 2:00 p.m. on Wednesday, August 5, 2020. 
The government's initial production was a subset of non-electronic discovery materials, 
totaling nearly 13,000 pages, which the defense expeditiously reviewed for high-level content. 
Upon initial review, the materials contain certain records related to one specific individual. 
However, nothing in the production specifically identifies this individual as Victim I, 2, or 3. 
The defense should not be required to speculate whether this individual is one of the three 
alleged Victims, and if so, which one. Moreover, the initial production does not appear to 
contain any materials identifying the other two alleged Victims. Although the government has 
indicated that it will provide additional discovery on a rolling basis, if the initial production is 
any guide, it seems unlikely that later productions will sufficiently identify the remaining alleged 
Victims. Furthermore, the defense should not be forced to wait almost two additional weeks 
until August 21, 2020 (the deadline for the production of initial non-electronic discovery) or 
potentially months until November 9, 2020 (deadline for the completion of all discovery) before 
learning information that is vital to the defense. Ms. Maxwell's right to a fair trial depends on 
the defense's ability to adequately investigate the charges against her, and that investigation will 
be significantly impaired until we know for certain the names of Victims 1-3. 
July 14, 2020 Tr. at 12:14-17; see also id. at 12:25-13:3 ("Following the entry of [the] protective order . . . the 
government is prepared to make a substantial production of discovery.").

District courts have the inherent authority to compel pretrial disclosure of the identities of 
government witnesses. See United States v. Cannone, 528 F.2d 296, 301 (2d Cir. 1975). Such 
disclosure is warranted when there is a specific showing that the disclosure is material to the 
preparation of the defense and reasonable in light of the circumstances surrounding the case. See 
id. at 302; United States v. Rueb, No. 00 CR. 91 (RWS), 2001 WL 96177, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 
5, 2001) (ordering disclosure of government witness list where defendant "ha[d] met his burden 
to show a particularized need that outweighs the possible dangers of disclosure").2 
This 
principle has been applied in sex crimes cases, where the right of the defendant to prepare a 
defense can outweigh the privacy interests of alleged victims referenced in the indictment and 
warrant the disclosure of their identities. See United States v. Warme, No. 09CR19A, 2009 WL 
427111, at *2 (W.D.N.Y. Feb. 20, 2009) (ordering government to disclose identity of sex crime 
victim where "defendant's ability to adequately prepare a defense against this charge is 
significantly compromised without being advised of the identity of the alleged victim"); see also 
id. ("Absent knowing the identity of Victim 1, the defendant is precluded from investigating the 
facts surrounding the crime charged."). 
The defense's narrowly-tailored request, which only seeks the disclosure of the identity 
of Victims 1-3, and not the government's entire witness list, is also reasonable in light of the 
circumstances of this case. And because the protective order prohibits Ms. Maxwell, defense 
counsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity of any 
alleged victim or potential witness referenced in the discovery materials (Dkt. 36 ¶ 5), the 
disclosure will have no impact on the privacy interests of Victims 1-3. Nor is there any basis for 
the government to claim that there is a risk that witnesses will face intimidation or refuse to 
testify.; To the contrary, many alleged victims have already chosen to speak on the record in 
criminal proceedings in the Epstein case and in this case; to file civil suits against Mr. Epstein, 
Ms. Maxwell and others, and to provide deposition testimony and discovery in those suits; and to 
give interviews to the press and other television and film productions. Moreover, Victims 1-3 
are no longer minors, but are now adults in their late 30s or early 40s, which provides additional 
assurance that they will be willing to appear for trial. Disclosure is therefore warranted here. 
In determining whether to order pretrial disclosure of the identity of witnesses, some district courts have 
considered the following factors: (1) Did the offense alleged in the indictment involve a crime of violence? (2) 
Have the defendants been arrested or convicted for crimes involving violence? (3) Will the evidence in the case 
largely consist of testimony relating to documents (which by their nature are not easily altered)? (4) Is there a 
realistic possibility that supplying the witnesses' names prior to trial will increase the likelihood that the 
prosecution's witnesses will not appear at trial, or will be unwilling to testify at trial? (5) Does the indictment allege 
offenses occurring over an extended period of time, making preparation of the defendants' defense complex and 
difficult? (6) Do the defendants have limited funds with which to investigate and prepare their defense? Rueb, 
2001 WL 96177, at *7-8 (citation omitted). The Second Circuit, however, has not adopted these factors, nor do they 
constitute an exhaustive list of factors that the Court may consider in determining whether to disclose the identities 
of alleged victims. 
Notably, the government did not argue at the bail hearing that Ms. Maxwell posed a danger to the community. 
(See 7/14/2020 Tr. at 37:15-21).

The Honorable Alison J. Nathan

Page 4 
See Warme, 2009 WL 427111, at *2 (ordering government to disclose identity of sex crime 
victim where "the government has not demonstrated that disclosing the identity to the defendant 
would subject the victim to a significant risk, or to increase the likelihood that victim will refuse 
to appear or testify"). 
With each day that passes without knowing the identities of Victims 1-3, the defense is 
losing crucial time to conduct a meaningful investigation and prepare its defense so that Ms. 
Maxwell can receive a fair trial on the schedule set by the Court. For these reasons, we 
respectfully request the Court to order the government to disclose the identities of Victims 1-3 to 
defense counsel, consistent with the provisions of the protective order. 
2. Ms. Maxwell's Conditions of Confinement and Access to Discovery 
We also seek the Court's assistance to improve Ms. Maxwell's conditions of confinement 
at the Metropolitan Detention Center ("MDC"), and her access to the discovery in this case, so 
that she can meaningfully participate in her defense. As discussed below, Ms. Maxwell has been 
treated less favorably than a typical pretrial detainee, and this has impacted her ability to assist in 
her defense. 
It has become apparent that the GOP's treatment of Ms. Maxwell is a reaction to the 
circumstances surrounding the pretrial detention and death of Mr. Epstein. On July 6, 2019, Mr. 
Epstein was arrested and detained at the Metropolitan Correctional Center ("MCC") on sex 
trafficking charges, and was subsequently assigned to the MCC's Special Housing Unit ("SHU") 
due to risk factors for suicide and safety concerns. After an apparent suicide attempt on July 23, 
2019, Mr. Epstein was transferred to suicide watch and then psychological observation. On 
August 10, 2019, Mr. Epstein's body was discovered in his cell. Thereafter, the government 
indicted the two correctional officers who were assigned to the SHU at the time of Mr. Epstein's 
death. 
As a result of what occurred with Mr. Epstein, Ms. Maxwell is being treated worse than 
other similarly situated pretrial detainees, which significantly impacts her ability to prepare a 
defense and be ready for trial on the schedule set by the Court. Since arriving at the MDC over a 
month ago, on July 6, 2020, Ms. Maxwell has been held under uniquely onerous conditions. Ms. 
Maxwell has been confined alone in an area outside of the general population for the entire 36-
day period (40 days if we include her confinement in New Hampshire), which is over three 
weeks longer than the 14-day quarantine period required for all new arrivals to the MDC under 
current COVID-19 protocols, and there is no indication that this will change. She continues to 
be surveilled 24 hours a day by security cameras and by multiple prison guards, many of whom 
do not appear to be regular MDC personnel. These prison guards constantly observe Ms. 
Maxwell and take notes on her every activity, including her phone conversations with defense 
counsel. Until recently, Ms. Maxwell was subjected to suicide watch protocols, including being 
woken up every few hours during the night and being forced to wear special clothing, despite the 
EFTA00018575
--- PAGE 5 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 38 Filed 08/10/20 Page 5 of 6 
The Honorable Alison J. Nathan 
August 10, 2020 
Page 5 
fact that she, unlike Mr. Epstein, has never been suicidal and was never diagnosed as exhibiting 
risk factors for suicide. Her cell is searched multiple times a day and she has been forced to 
undergo numerous body scans. 
In addition, Ms. Maxwell's access to the standard prison 
resources available to other pretrial detainees in the general population has been extensively 
curtailed or eliminated altogether. 
This treatment threatens Ms. Maxwell's Sixth Amendment right to participate in her 
defense. This case will require time-consuming review of voluminous discovery materials. Ms. 
Maxwell must therefore have adequate time to review the materials, to confidentially take notes 
on them, and to discuss them with her attorneys. But there currently is no such structure in 
place. Indeed, although the government agreed that Ms. Maxwell would have access to a hard 
drive containing the discovery in the MDC, it is our understanding that the hard drive containing 
the first production has not yet been made available to Ms. Maxwell. 
Defense counsel understands that the BOP has proposed (but not yet implemented) a 
procedure that would permit Ms. Maxwell to use a computer on her floor to review discovery 
materials during the three-hour period each day that she is not confined to her cell. But there are 
two significant flaws in this proposal: 
• 
The three-hour period is specifically designated to be used by Ms. 
Maxwell for recreation, exercise, and personal hygiene, including 
showers. The BOP should not be permitted to force Ms. Maxwell to 
choose between maintenance of her physical and mental health and 
participating in her own defense. 
• 
Even if Ms. Maxwell were to forgo personal maintenance altogether, three 
hours a day is on its face an insufficient amount of time for reviewing 
documents in a complex case with voluminous document discovery, such 
as this one. As an illustration, the government's first set of production 
materials consists of nearly 13,000 pages of documents. Assuming it 
takes Ms. Maxwell an average of one minute to review each page of those 
materials, based on the BOP's proposed cap of three hours per day of 
review, Ms. Maxwell would conceivably finish reviewing this first set of 
documents at the earliest by mid-November 2020. 
This is entirely 
unworkable under the schedule set by the Court. 
Ms. Maxwell does not seek special treatment at the MDC; but she does ask that she not 
be specially disfavored in her treatment in detention, especially when it comes to preparing her 
defense to conduct that allegedly took place over 25 years ago. In light of the voluminous 
discovery that we expect to receive, Ms. Maxwell would normally be spending 40 hours a week 
or more reviewing the discovery. Ms. Maxwell should be granted a comparable amount of time

The Honorable Alison J. Nathan 
August 10, 2020 
Page 6 
to review the discovery in the MDC so that she can engage in her defense full-time. We 
therefore request that Ms. Maxwell: 
• 
Be released to the general population and be granted the privileges given 
to other pretrial detainees. 
• 
Be given significantly increased access to a computer terminal in order to 
review the discovery in this case. 
For the reasons set forth above, we respectfully submit that the Court should grant Ms. 
Maxwell's motion.

Haddon, Morgan and Foreman, P C 
Laura A. Menninger 
Denver, Colorado 80203

Dear Judge Preska: 
I write in response to the Court's Order of August 3, 2020 (Doc. 1069), the Order and 
Protocol for Unsealing Decided Motions (Doc. 1044) ("Protocol"), and to raise with the Court 
the legal effect of new information that came to the attention of counsel for Ms. Maxwell on 
Friday, August 7, 2020. 
New information: On Friday, August 7, 2020, counsel for Ms. Maxwell learned of 
critical new information that impacts both this action and U.S. v. Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) 
(the "Criminal Action"). The information implicates Ms. Maxwell's right to due process and 
fairness in this civil action and affects the Second Circuit's review of the Court's unsealing 
order of July 23, 2020. Additionally, the information implicates her rights as a criminal 
defendant guaranteed under the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Amendments. 
Counsel makes the representations about implications of the new information as an 
officer of this Court. At this time, counsel is not at liberty to disclose the information because 
it is subject to a protective order in the Criminal Action, which forbids its use "for any civil 
proceeding or any purpose other than the defense" of the criminal action absent "further order 
of the Court." Protective Order, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) at 
1(a), 18 (Exhibit A). As required by 
that Protective Order and Judge Nathan's Individual Practices in Criminal Cases, counsel 
initiated a conferral with the U.S. Attorney's Office over the weekend concerning a 
modification of the Protective Order to share the information with this Court and the Second 
Circuit. Barring agreement, Ms. Maxwell intends to seek modification of the Protective Order 
in the Criminal Action from Judge Nathan forthwith to permit sharing the information with 
this Court, ex parte and in camera if necessary, and with the Second Circuit (likewise under 
seal if necessary).

Honorable Loretta A. Preska

Page 2 
Ms. Maxwell requests a temporary stay of the unsealing process for approximately 
three weeks until the conclusion of (a) the conferral with the U.S. Attorney's Office to a 
modification of the Protective Order in the Criminal Action and, if necessary, an application 
and ruling by Judge Nathan on the issue, to permit the use of the information in this Court and 
before the Second Circuit (under seal in both courts, if necessary), (b) an application to this 
Court containing the new information in support of a request to stay the unsealing process 
until the conclusion of the Criminal Action, and (c) a ruling by this Court on the motion for 
stay. 
Streamlining of Unsealing Process: As directed by the Court, counsel for Ms. Maxwell 
conferred with plaintiff's counsel concerning various proposals to streamline the unsealing 
process. Subject to Ms. Maxwell's request to temporarily pause the process as described 
above, defense counsel has agreed to several potential modifications of the Protocol which we 
hope will ease the burden on the parties and the Court going forward, should the unsealing 
move ahead. Of note, and as Plaintiff will explain to the Court, the parties have agreed to 
notify all of the Non-Parties at once so that we can understand which Non-Parties object to the 
unsealing before deciding how to proceed with future redactions. Although this will give the 
Court and the Original Parties more information about the scope of objectors, there are 
limitations to the extent to which it will expedite the process. As counsel has made clear in 
the past, it will take significant effort by the Original Parties and their staff to put together the 
excerpts for any Non-Party who requests them because each Non-Party will be entitled to see 
his or her own information (but not that of other Non-Parties). After receiving a request from 
a Non-Party, we anticipate it will take up to a week per Non-Party to agree to the excerpts to 
send to them for review. But on balance we agree that having a sense of the number of 
participating Non-Parties will aid the Court in conducting future proceedings, we have agreed 
to Plaintiff's suggestion on that front. The parties can submit a proposed modification of the 
Protocol and Notice to the Court to reflect this agreement. 
We also have agreed, as the Court suggested, to shorten the time period for the 
Original Parties to object and to respond from 14 to 7 days. This would impact paragraphs 
2(d), 2(e) and 2(f) of the Protocol. The parties can also submit a proposed modification of the 
Protocol to the Court. The parties also agreed to leave the time for Non-Parties to object at 14 
days given some practical considerations applicable to them. 
Although the parties were able to reach some agreement, we cannot agree to all of 
Plaintiff's proposals and write separately to explain the basis for our disagreements. 
First, we carefully considered the Court's suggestion to reduce the number of pages of 
briefing to ten pages per side. Id. Our initial Objection (DE 1057) was 14 pages long; 
Plaintiff's Response was 19 pages. The Court concluded that our Objection was, in many 
respects, not specific enough. We would ask leave to at least have 15 pages to object to the 
five motions proposed below, with any response limited to the same. We will endeavor to 
keep it shorter than that, but also allow for more space to provide specifics to the Court. 
Second, we have obtained new contact information for Doe 1 from a separate civil 
suit. We believe that Doe 1 retains a right to notification and participation. We suggest

Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1100 Filed 08/10/20 Page 3 of 3 
Honorable Loretta A. Preska 
August 10, 2020 
Page 3 
providing the Notice to Doe 1 at the new address for any future pleadings that implicate his or 
her deposition, which is currently subject to the Second Circuit's stay. 
Third, to prevent against some of the errors that occurred during the last round of 
unsealings, we request that the Protocol be amended to require the Responding Original Party 
who proposes unsealing to supply with their Response a proposed unredacted set of the 
pleadings at issue, for the Court's consideration and for the Objecting Original Party or Non-
Party to have the right of reply. Preparing those redactions after the fact allows much 
ambiguity into the Court's ruling and we believe the Court's ruling should specify which 
redactions it is accepting or rejecting at the time of ruling. 
Finally, we request that the Court allow for the any objecting Non-Party or Original 
Party be given 7 days following any unseal order to apply for relief in the Second Circuit from 
the order prior to the documents being released. 
Proposed Next Set of Docket Entries for Review: 
Given the Second Circuit's stay concerning Ms. Maxwell and Doe l's deposition 
transcripts and materials that quote from them, we propose that the Court deviate from the 
Doe 1 and 2 chronology (given that Doe l's deposition is sprinkled throughout those motions) 
and instead take the following five decided motions and their related pleadings. This list 
represents the first five chronological decided motions that (a) have sealed or redacted 
materials and (b) do not have attached or quote from documents subject to the stay. They are: 
• 
— Defendant's Motion to Compel Responses to Defendant's First Set of 
Discovery Responses to Plaintiff 
• 
139 — Plaintiff's Brief in Support of the Privilege Claimed for In Camera 
Submission 
• 
155 — Defendant's Motion to Compel Non-Privileged Documents 
• 
215 - Sharon Churcher Motion to Quash Subpoena 
• 
231 — Defendant's Motion to Reopen Deposition of Plaintiff 
Counsel for Ms. Maxwell is available for a telephone conference to discuss any of the 
foregoing, should the Court desire. 
Respectfully submitted,

Assistant United States Attorney 
New York, New York 10007 
Re: Conferral Concerning Use of Discovery Materials GM_00000847-962 
Dear 
Ms. Maxwell is actively litigating issues related to disclosure of confidential material 
in ME v. Ghislaine Maxwell, No. 15 Civ. 7433 (LAP) and a related appeal in the 
United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, 20-2413. 
We intend to ask Judge Nathan for permission to refer to and attach, as exhibits, the 
above referenced discovery materials which relate to the Government's efforts to 
obtain civil litigation discovery material ("the Unsealing Materials") in two, settled, 
civil matters in which Ms. Maxwell was named a defendant. These materials would 
be disclosed to Judge Preska and designated as part of the appendix to Ms. Maxwell's 
appeal in the Second Circuit. We have no objection, at this point, to filing the 
materials under seal in both courts. 
In your letter to defense counsel dated August 5, 2020 you designated the Unsealing 
Materials as Confidential. We understand that the Unsealing Materials were filed ex 
parte and remain sealed in the miscellaneous actions. The documents, however, do 
not contain confidential information as that term is defined in paragraph 8 of the 
Protective Order entered by Judge Nathan. The Unsealing Materials are ex parte 
pleadings filed by the Government, transcripts of ex parte hearings regarding those 
pleadings, and ex parte rulings on the pleadings. As least one set of individuals 
outside this prosecution, the Boies, Schiller & Flexner lawyers cooperating with the 
Government, are aware of the Unsealing Materials. Moreover, these are the types of 
pleadings that the Second Circuit has characterized as judicial documents with a 
presumptive right of public access. See Brown v. Maxwell, 929 F.3d 41, 47 (2d Cir. 
2019). Ms. Maxwell, under paragraph 9 of the Protective Order in this case, notifies 
EFTA00018583
--- PAGE 2 ---
August 9, 2020 
Page 2 
the Government that she objects to the confidential designation and requests that the 
Government withdraw the designation. 
The relevance of these documents to the unsealing protocol currently in process 
before Judge Preska and the related appeal are readily apparent and I believe that the 
government should, in the interest of justice, agree to these requests. If that is not the 
case, I am happy to confer further about the issue as soon as possible. The Second 
Circuit Court of Appeals established an expedited briefing schedule and Judge Preska 
ordered that the parties in 15 Civ. 7433 meet regarding modification to the unsealing 
protocol by August 10, 2020. Accordingly, we will need to raise this issue with Judge 
Nathan this week. 
Please let me know your position on the matter and, if you would like to discuss the 
request further, your availability on August 10 or 11, 2020. 
Very truly yours, 
Jeffrey S. Pagliuca

Attached is a spreadsheet of all the devices we have listed in a warrant for the Epstein/Maxwell cases. Based on 
information from both of you and from 
I've compiled the FBI 1.8 number, barcode number, and CART 
number for each device. For your reference, I'm also attaching the June 2020 warrant, which includes 62 of these 
devices. The other three devices are contained in the draft warrant I sent on Friday. Would you please confirm that all of 
the numbers in this spreadsheet are accurate? 
Once you have confirmed the accuracy of this chart, we plan to provide a version of the chart to Maxwell's attorneys. 
Please feel free to give me a call if you would like to discuss.

Hi 
Hope you're doing well. As our team is reviewing these materials in connection with discovery, we wanted to follow up 
with you about this project. In particular, we were hoping you could tell us how your office approached CDs that were in 
the boxes of materials from Florida. We noticed in the scans we received some documents that looked like the attached 
file — which looks like a photocopy of the CD. Were those materials downloaded by your office? If not, no worries at all, 
we have them from the primary file, but we wanted to check with you to make sure we had the complete set of materials 
you sent. 
Thanks very much,

Hi =, 
Wanted to quickly check in to follow up on our conversations last week and earlier this week — I think you were able to 
transmit the scanned records to S 
but I'm not sure whether that was just the 16,000 pages you mentioned when we 
last spoke, or if you were able to get all 29,000 to her? And we're also hoping to confirm for sure that all the materials you 
received were definitely scanned in, and to get an index or catalog of those materials (including what media was 
included). 
Another person on our team, 
who's copied, is jumping in to coordinate on this, so if it's easier to chat via 
phone her number is 
and please let us know if anything would be helpful on our end. 
thanks again!

(USANYS)" 
In our first discovery letter to Jeffrey Epstein (attached) we made several disclosures about certain witness statements — 
M, you might remember when we discussed this way back then. In an abundance of caution, we'd like to also provide 
Maxwell with one of these statements in particular (the third in the letter). The text is copied here: 
• 
During the Palm Beach Department's investigation of the defendant in 2005, a witness ("Witness-1") 
disclosed to detectives that the defendant had paid Witness-1 to bring girls for sexualized massages, and 
that the defendant told her: "the younger the better." Witness-1 described bringing multiple girls who 
were under the age of eighteen to the defendant's residence in Florida. Witness-1 recalled bringing a girl 
who was over eighteen, and that the defendant told Witness-1 that this girl was too old. Witness-1 
remarked of the defendant: "He likes the girls that are between the ages of 18 and 20." Witness-1 is 
represented by Rita Glavin, Esq. 
For context, this witness is 
and she interacted with Epstein in the early 2000s. This statement occurred in a 
videotaped interview with Palm Beach PD. Is it okay with you if we provide this same disclosure in a letter to Maxwell (or 
a stand-alone letter, if you prefer)? Please let us know if you'd prefer that we take a different approach, and of course
and 
and I are happy to discuss if a call is easier. 
Thanks,

If you wish to inspect any of the physical evidence referenced in these materials, including 
items listed on search inventories, please let us know, and we will make arrangements for you to 
do so. 
The defendant also made oral statements when he was arrested on or about July 6, 2019. 
Notes memorializing those statements are included in this production and are marked with control 
number USAO 002273. 
The Government recognizes its obligations under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), 
and its progeny. Pursuant to those obligations, we are disclosing the information below. This 
disclosure should not be taken to indicate that the Government believes the enclosed information 
constitutes Brady material. 
Rather, we make this disclosure in an abundance of caution. 
Specifically, the Government discloses the following: 
• 
The victim identified in the Indictment as "Victim-1" received a grand jury subpoena 
from the Southern District of Florida ("SDFL") in or about 2008. However, Victim-1 
was never interviewed by law enforcement, including the West Palm Beach Police 
Department, Federal Bureau of investigation ("FBI") or SDFL in connection with their 
investigation, and Victim-1 did not testify before the grand jury in SDFL. Victim-1 was 
first interviewed by law enforcement regarding Jeffrey Epstein in or about 2019, after 
FBI agents from the New York Field Office working with this Office approached Victim-
1. The victims identified in the Indictment as "Victim-2" and "Victim-3" we both 
interviewed by law enforcement in connection with the SDFL investigation in or around 
2007. Please note that all three of these victims are currently represented by counsel. 
• 
During an interview with FBI agents in West Palm Beach, Florida in or around 2007, the 
victim identified in the Indictment as "Victim-2" stated that during her first contact with 
the defendant, she told the defendant that she had just turned eighteen, when in fact she 
was younger than eighteen at the time. In subsequent interviews, Victim-2 has told law 
enforcement that the first time she met Epstein, she told him that she was 16, when in fact 
she was younger than sixteen. Victim-2 further stated that she brought other victims to 
the defendant's residence for sexualized massages. She initially told these victims that 
they should tell the defendant that they were older than they in fact were. Over time, 
however, Victim-2 stopped telling other victims this because she came to understand that 
the defendant had a specific preference for underage girls. 
• 
During the Palm Beach Department's investigation of the defendant in 2005, a witness 
("Witness-1") disclosed to detectives that the defendant had paid Witness-1 to bring girls 
for sexualized massages, and that the defendant told her: "the younger the 
better." Witness-1 described bringing multiple girls who were under the age of eighteen 
to the defendant's residence in Florida. Witness-1 recalled bringing a girl who was over 
eighteen, and that the defendant told Witness-1 that this girl was too old. Witness-1 
remarked of the defendant: "He likes the girls that are between the ages of 18 and 20." 
Witness-1 is represented by Rita Glavin, Esq.

Government will provide material under Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 154 (1972), 
and its progeny, in a timely manner prior to trial and consistent with the schedule agreed upon by 
the parties or set by the Court. 
Disclosure by the Defendant 
In light of your request for discovery in this case, the Government hereby requests 
reciprocal discovery under Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(b). Specifically, we request that you allow 
inspection and copying of: (1) any books, or copies or portions thereof, which are in the 
defendant's possession, custody or control, and which the defendant intends to introduce as 
evidence or otherwise rely on at trial; and (2) any results or reports of physical or mental 
examinations and of scientific tests or experiments made in connection with this case, or copies 
thereof, which are in the defendant's possession or control, and which the defendant intends to 
introduce as evidence or otherwise rely on at trial or which were prepared by a witness whom the 
defendant intends to call at trial. 
The Government also requests that the defendant disclose prior statements of witnesses he 
will call to testify. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 26.2; United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225 (1975). We 
request that such material be provided on the same basis upon which we agree to supply the 
defendant with 3500 material relating to Government witnesses. 
Sentence Reduction for Acceptance of Responsibility 
This Office will oppose the additional one-point reduction under the Sentencing Guidelines 
available for defendants who plead prior to the Government's initiation of trial preparations 
pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(b), in the event your client has not entered a plea of guilty six weeks 
prior to trial. We will follow this policy whether or not suppression or other pretrial motions 
remain outstanding after this date and even if the trial date has not been announced by the Court 
six weeks in advance of the trial.

Finally, please be advised that pursuant to the policy of this Office concerning plea offers, 
no plea offer is effective unless and until made in writing and signed by authorized representatives 
of the Office. In particular, discussions regarding the pretrial disposition of a matter that are not 
reduced to writing and signed by authorized representatives of the Office cannot and do not 
constitute a "formal offer" or a "plea offer," as those terms are used in Lafier v. Cooper, 132 S. Ct. 
1376 (2012); Missouri v. Fiye, 132 S. Ct. 1399 (2012).

Good afternoon 
This case is scheduled for trial on July 12, 2021? If so, would you be able to give me a brief summary 
for Dr.Cooper to review? Once she has a chance to review it, I will be happy to schedule a conference 
call between you. 
Thanks for your kind consideration. 
Warm regards,

Good afternoon, 
My colleagues, 
and 
and I are the prosecutors in the case of United 
States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, which is scheduled to go to trial on July 12, 2020 in the Southern District 
of New York. We are reaching out because we would be interested in speaking with Dr. Cooper about 
potentially testifying at trial. Would it be possible to schedule a call with Dr. Cooper to discuss? 
Thanks very much, 
Assistant United States Attorney

Thanks a bunch. Happy to join the call if that's useful. Sounds like we'll need an okay from MDC before 
will put this 
in motion.

It sure we will research one tonight and place the order tomorrow. It depends on availability and delivery. Do we have a 
copy of the data that goes with the drive? 
Also with the ever changing policies in BOP, can you confirm that they will allow her to have a laptop. Not sure the rules 
at MDC.

Hi =,

(USANYS) 
I hope you're doing well. Because of some discovery accessibility issues we're having in the Ghislaine Maxwell case, we 
would like to provide a clean laptop to Maxwell in MDC for discovery review purposes. The laptop need only permit 
review of standard files — word, pdf, .tif, .xls, etc. All other capabilities and programs can be disabled. I understand we 
did something similar in the Avenatti case, and we'd like to do the same here. Would that be possible? It would be a 
huge help to us if you could possibly prep and provide us with a laptop for this purpose. 
Thanks so much—

The FOIA media team advised they downloaded media from file number 31E-MM-108062, including audio and video. However, there seem to be some technical issues, 
as they are unable to listen to 48 audios located in the 1A Vol 3. Per our Document Conversion Unit, this is a "codec problem," meaning there was probably some sort of 
user error from The AUSA's office when they exported the media to the disc. This issue cannot be resolved on our end. It would have to be addressed with whomever 
sent us the media. With this one exemption, the rest of the media we downloaded to OPWAN is viewable. Please see below a list with a brief description of the items. 
I'm not sure if this is all the media contained in the file though. Hope this helps. Please let me know if you have questions or need further assistance.

Hi 
Hope you're doing well. As our team is reviewing these materials in connection with discovery, we wanted to follow up with you about this project. In particular, we 
were hoping you could tell us how your office approached CDs that were in the boxes of materials from Florida. We noticed in the scans we received some documents 
that looked like the attached file — which looks like a photocopy of the CO. Were those materials downloaded by your office? If not, no worries at all, we have them 
from the primary file, but we wanted to check with you to make sure we had the complete set of materials you sent. 
Thanks very much,

Wanted to quickly check in to follow up on our conversations last week and earlier this week — I think you were able to transmit the scanned records to S
 but I'm 
not sure whether that was just the 16,000 pages you mentioned when we last spoke, or if you were able to get all 29,000 to her? And we're also hoping to confirm for

Another person on our team, S

Hey everyone: Here's the latest draft of our letter and declaration on this issue. We are still 
confirming a few things, but they shouldn't impact the substance of the Maxwell discussion. There is 
also a chance that there's a separate declaration from the MDC; if there is, it should contain the same 
substance re: Maxwell that's in the attached draft. 
Our response is due tomorrow. I'm generally around later this evening or tomorrow if there's 
anything you'd like to discuss. 
Thanks very much.

--- PAGE 2 ---
: We are in the process of finalizing our response to the Maxwell/Rivera issue. We intend to 
explain that the discovery and counsel access accommodations that have been provided to Maxwell 
and Rivera, respectively, result from the specific circumstances of their cases, the specific requests of 
their lawyers, and their individual housing circumstances. On all of these factors, there are several 
important differences, including: 
The Maxwell case has multiple times more discovery than the Rivera case. Hence, the need for 
such expanded discovery access is greater in the Maxwell case. 
At the MDC, Maxwell has a unique housing situation, as she is in protective custody outside the 
general population. She therefore has sole access to a room to use a computer and phone for 
approximately 13 hours a day. Rivera, by contrast, is housed in the general population. 
There are approximately 8o other inmates at the MCC in Rivera's unit that use the same VTC 
room for court appearances, probation interviews, and attorney meetings. By contrast, Maxwell 
shares access to the MDC VTC room with substantially fewer inmates. The MDC can therefore 
provide 15 hours of VTC meetings with her attorneys without compromising access for other 
MDC inmates. The same is not true for Rivera at the MCC. 
Going forward, even though Rivera's counsel have asked (and the Court has ordered) that Rivera 
receive three hours of laptop access each day, the MCC is now leaving the laptop with him all day long, 
and only takes it back at night to charge it. Therefore, the MCC is now providing the same amount of 
electronic discovery access to Rivera that Maxwell receives at the MDC. 
As for providing Rivera with up to 15 hours of VTC access, we will explain that doing so will 
compromise access for other inmates. If defense counsel expresses a need for additional time, the 
MCC will continue to find ways to accommodate those requests as best as they can. 
Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss this further. 
Best,

Thanks, 
Can you keep me posted on what we think will be the substance of the draft declaration when you know 
(that is, before we are submitting anything on 12/31)? And how much of this is attributable to differences between MCC 
and MDC, as well as specific differences in their housing situations?

Subject: Disparities in Counsel and Discovery Access for Ghislaine Maxwell and Justin Rivera 
All: 
I wanted to bring to your attention a recent issue that's surfaced in United States v. Rivera et al., a sex 
trafficking case pending before Judge Engelmayer. As I'll describe in more detail below, Judge 
Engelmayer has asked us to submit a declaration from the BOP explaining why the discovery and 
counsel access accommodations provided to Ghislaine Maxwell (detained at the MDC outside the 
general population) cannot be extended to Justin Rivera (detained at the MCC in the general 
population). 
Justin Rivera was charged in February 2019 with sex trafficking conspiracy. He's been detained at the 
MCC since April 2019 on consent (he's also serving a state sentence). His trial, which was originally 
scheduled for April 2019, is expected to start on February 16, 2020. In July 2020, he had new counsel 
appointed, citing an irreconcilable breakdown with his former counsel. 
Since this fall, Judge Engelmayer has become increasingly frustrated with the MCC's treatment of 
Rivera. In particular, he's cited their failure to provide Rivera with adequate accommodations to 
review discovery and meet with his lawyers, who refuse to visit Rivera at the MCC for personal health 
concerns. We have two court orders in place to address these issues: (0 a laptop order, which requires 
the MCC to provide Rivera access to a laptop for three hours per day; and (2) a videoconference order, 
which requires the MCC to make available four hours of videoconferencing each week, in addition to 
any telephone or videoconference calls obtained through the Federal Defenders. 
At the moment, there's not a concern, at least from Judge Engelmayer, that the amount of time Rivera 
has for videoconferences and electronic discovery review is insufficient for trial preparation, although 
defense counsel has stated that they may request more time in the future. However, in a letter last 
night and during a court conference this morning (transcript attached), defense counsel cited the 
accommodations that the MDC has provided to Maxwell, describing them as "strikingly different and 
far superior" to those afforded to Rivera. Defense counsel further suggested that Rivera was being 
treated differently on account of his race, gender and class. Judge Engelmayer stated that the 
disparity in access "jumped off the page" and that the optics were "terrible," and asked us to explain
the rationale for the differing treatment. After conferring with 
and 
before 
our conference, we explained our understanding that the disparity comes down to the fact that 
Maxwell and Rivera have very different housing situations, with Maxwell's situation being more 
amenable to greater access to electronic discovery review and legal visits. 
Judge Engelmayer asked us to submit a declaration, from an appropriate person at the BOP, 
explaining in more detail why the accommodations provided to Maxwell cannot be extended to Rivera. 
Based on the recent bail opposition in the Maxwell case, I believe the differences in counsel/discovery 
access are as follows: 
Accommodation 
Maxwell 
Rivera 
Review of electronic 
discovery (NB: each 
defendant has laptop access) 
hours per day/7 days per 
week (91 hours total) 
hours per day/7 days per 
week (21 hours total) 
Counsel visits (by video) 
hours per day/5 days per 
week (15 hours total) 
Four hours per week (plus an 
additional two hours 
EFTA00018661
--- PAGE 4 ---
scheduled through the 
Federal Defenders) (6 hours 
total) 
Weekend legal calls 
As needed 
Not available 
The declaration is due by December 31. Because Judge Engelmayer's request implicates at least two 
criminal cases, and potentially the ongoing civil litigation with the MCC, we wanted to make sure that 
you were all aware of this issue.  We are also happ to set up a call to discuss this further. In the 
meantime, we are working with 
to identify the appropriate declarant and draft an 
explanation for the Court.

IN THE MATTER OF THE USE OF A CELL-

CELLULAR DEVI E ASSIGNED CALL 
NUMBS 
Case No. 1:20-
Filed Under Seal — Level II 
AFFIDAVIT IN SUPPORT OF 
AN APPLICATION FOR A SEARCH WARRANT 
I,-, 
being first duly sworn, hereby depose and state as follows: 
INTRODUCTION AND AGENT BACKGROUND 
1. 
I make this affidavit in support of an application for a search warrant under Federal 
Rule of Criminal Procedure 41 to authorize law enforcement to employ an electronic investigative 
technique, which is described in Attachment B, to determine the location of the cellular device 
assigned call numbe 
(the "Target Cellular Device"), which is described in 
Attachment A. 
2. 
I am a Special Agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI"), and have 
been since 2017. I am currently assigned to investigate violations of criminal law relating to the 
sexual exploitation of children as part of an FBI Task Force. I have gained expertise in this area 
through classroom training and daily work related to these types of investigations. As part of my 
responsibilities, I have been involved in the investigation of cases involving sex trafficking, 
enticement of minors, and transportation of minors for illegal sex acts, and have participated in the 
execution of search warrants involving electronic evidence and cellular devices. 
3. 
The facts in this affidavit come from my personal observations, my training and 
experience, and information obtained from other agents and witnesses. This affidavit is intended 
EFTA00018664
--- PAGE 3 ---
to show merely that there is sufficient probable cause for the requested warrant and does not set 
forth all of my knowledge about this matter. 
4. 
One purpose of applying for this warrant is to determine with precision the Target 
Cellular Device's location. However, there is reason to believe the Target Cellular Device is 
currently located somewhere within this district. On or about June 30, 2020, United States 
Magistrate Judge Katharine H. Parker, signed a warrant for cellphone location information for the 
Target Cellular Device (the "GPS Warrant"), which is attached as Exhibit A. Pursuant to the GPS 
Warrant, the FBI has received GPS location data since approximately 10:15 p.m. on June 30, 2020 
and has also historical cell site data for the Target Cellular Device for the period June 1, 2020 to 
the present. That data shows that the Target Cellular Device is currently located in the District of 
New Hampshire and has been located in the District of New Hampshire for the last 30 days. The 
location data has allowed the FBI to identify approximately one square mile in which the Target 
Cellular Device is located, but the location data is insufficiently specific to allow the FBI to 
identify the particular building in which the Target Cellular Device is currently located. Pursuant 
to Rule 41(b)(2), law enforcement may locate the Target Cellular Device outside the district 
provided the device is within the district when the warrant is issued. 
5. 
Based on the facts set forth herein, there is probable cause to believe that 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL has violated 18 U.S.C. § 371 (conspiracy to entice minors to travel to 
engage in illegal sex acts); 18 U.S.C. § 2422 (enticement of a minor to travel to engage in illegal 
sex acts); 18 U.S.C. § 371 (conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in criminal sexual 
activity); 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a) (transportation of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual 
activity); and 18 U.S.C. § 1623 (perjury). Specifically, on June 29, 2020, a grand jury sitting in 
the Southern District of New York returned an indictment charging MAXWELL with these crimes, 
EFTA00018665
--- PAGE 4 ---
which is attached as Exhibit B. That same day, United States Magistrate Judge Lisa Margaret 
Smith signed an arrest warrant for MAXWELL, which is attached as Exhibit C. 
6. 
There is also probable cause to believe that the Target Cellular Device's location 
will assist law enforcement in arresting MAXWELL, who is a "person to be arrested" within the 
meaning of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41(c)(4). In particular, and as detailed below, 
there is probable cause to believe that MAXWELL is the primary user of the Target Cellular 
Device which remains active. The FBI does not know MAXWELL's current location and 
accordingly requires the information sought in this application in order to locate and arrest 
MAXWELL. 
7. 
Because collecting the information authorized by this warrant may fall within the 
statutory definitions of a "pen register" or a "trap and trace device," see 18 U.S.C. § 3127(3) & 
(4), this warrant is designed to comply with the Pen Register Statute as well as Rule 41. See 18 
U.S.C. §§ 3121-3127. This warrant therefore includes all the information required to be included 
in a pen register order. See 18 U.S.C. § 3123(b)(1). Consistent with the requirement for a pen 
register order, I certify that the information likely to be obtained is relevant to an ongoing criminal 
investigation by FBI. See 18 U.S.0 §§ 3122(b), 3123(b). 
8. 
Consistent with the requirement for a pen register order, I certify that the 
information likely to be obtained is relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation by FBI. See 18 
U.S.0 §§ 3122(b), 3123(b)." 
PROBABLE CAUSE 
9. 
Based on the following, I respectfully submit there is probable cause to believe that 
the Target Cellular Device's location will assist law enforcement in locating and arresting 
MAXWELL pursuant to the arrest warrant described in paragraph 5, above. 
EFTA00018666
--- PAGE 5 ---
10. 
As set forth in Exhibit A, United States Magistrate Judge Katharine H. Parker found 
on June 30, 2020 that there is probable cause to believe that the location of the Target Cellular 
Device will reveal the location of GHISLAINE MAXWELL. As set forth in paragraph 4 above, 
that same day, the FBI received location information from AT&T revealing that the Target Cellular 
Device is currently located in the District of New Hampshire and has been located in the District 
of New Hampshire for at least the last 30 days. 
II. 
Based on my review of Customs and Border Patrol records, I know that 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL is a United States citizen and that she most recently entered the United 
States in or about June of 2019. There is no record of MAXWELL leaving the United States since 
her arrival in June of 2019. 
12. 
Based on my review of court filings, I am aware that GHISLAINE MAXWELL is 
represented by counsel in multiple ongoing civil lawsuits in the United States. As recently as in 
or about June 2020, attorney Laura Menninger appeared in in the Southern District of New York 
for oral argument before United States District Judge Loretta A. Preska on MAXWELL's behalf. 
13. 
Based on my review of AT&T records, I have learned that the Target Cellular 
Device is subscribed in the name of "G Max," which appears to be a shortened version of 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL's name. 
14. 
I further know from my review of AT&T records the following: 
a. The Target Cellular Device has been in contact with a phone subscribed to 
in the name of "Laura Menninger," which I know from my review of court records is the name of 
an attorney who currently represents GHISLAINE MAXWELL in civil litigation (the "Laura 
Menninger Phone"). The most recent contact between The Target Cellular Device and the Laura 
Menninger Phone occurred within the last 30 days. 
EFTA00018667
--- PAGE 6 ---
b. The Target Cellular Device has also been in contact with a phone subscribed 
to the business "Haddon, Morgan, & Foreman," which I know from my review of court records is 
the name of a law firm that currently represents GHISLAINE MAXWELL in civil litigation (the 
"Haddon, Morgan, & Foreman Phone"). The most recent contact between The Target Cellular 
Device and the Haddon, Morgan, & Foreman Phone occurred within the last 30 days. 
c. The Target Cellular Device has also been in contact with a phone subscribed 
to in the name of "Isabel Maxwell," which I know from my review of a law enforcement database 
is the name of GHISLAINE MAXWELL's sister (the "Isabel Maxwell Phone"). The most recent 
contact between The Target Cellular Device and the Isabel Maxwell Phone occurred in or about 
May 2020. 
d. The Target Cellular Device has also been in contact with a phone subscribed 
to in the name of "Scott Borgerson," which I know from my review of bank records and Amazon 
records is the name of an individual with whom GHISLAINE MAXWELL shares a joint bank 
account and to whom MAXWELL's Amazon account has sent multiple packages within 
approximately the last year (the "Scott Borgerson Phone"). The most recent contact between The 
Target Cellular Device and the Scott Borgerson Phone occurred in or about March 2020. 
15. 
Accordingly, I respectfully submit that there is probable cause to believe that the 
location of the Target Cellular Device will reveal the location of GHISLAINE MAXWELL. 
MANNER OF EXECUTION 
16. 
In my training and experience, I have learned that cellular phones and other cellular 
devices communicate wirelessly across a network of cellular infrastructure, including towers that 
route and connect individual communications. When sending or receiving a communication, a 
EFTA00018668
--- PAGE 7 ---
cellular device broadcasts certain signals to the cellular tower that is routing its communication. 
These signals include a cellular device's unique identifiers. 
17. 
To facilitate execution of this warrant to determine the location of the Target 
Cellular Device, law enforcement may use an investigative device or devices capable of 
broadcasting signals that will be received by the Target Cellular Device or receiving signals from 
nearby cellular devices, including the Target Cellular Device. Such a device may function in 
some respects like a cellular tower, except that it will not be connected to the cellular network and 
cannot be used by a cell phone to communicate with others. The device may send a signal to the 
Target Cellular Device and nearby cellular devices and thereby prompt them to send signals that 
include the unique identifier of the device. Law enforcement may monitor the signals broadcast 
by the Target Cellular Device for non-content signal information and use that information to 
determine the Target Cellular Device's location, even if it is located inside a house, apartment, or 
other building. 
The device will not intercept the contents of the Target Cellular Device's 
communications, such as telephone calls, text messages, and other electronic communications. 
Further, the device will not collect any other data stored on the Target Cellular Device, including 
e-mails, text messages, contact lists, images, or Global Positioning System (GPS) data. 
18. 
The investigative device may interrupt cellular service of phones or other cellular 
devices within its immediate vicinity. Any service disruption to non-target devices will be brief 
and temporary, and all operations will attempt to limit the interference with such devices. In order 
to connect with the Target Cellular Device, the device may briefly exchange signals with all phones 
or other cellular devices in its vicinity to determine whether those devices' unique identifiers match 
the identifiers of the Target Cellular Device. These signals may include cell phone identifiers. 
The device will not complete a connection with cellular devices determined not to be the Target 
EFTA00018669
--- PAGE 8 ---
Cellular Device, and law enforcement will limit collection of information from devices other than 
the Target Cellular Device. To the extent that any information from a cellular device other than 
the Target Cellular Device is collected by the law enforcement device, law enforcement will delete 
that information, and law enforcement will make no investigative use of it absent further order of 
the court, other than distinguishing the Target Cellular Device from all other cellular devices. 
AUTHORIZATION REQUEST 
19. 
Based on the foregoing, I request that the Court issue the proposed search warrant, 
pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41. The proposed warrant also will function as a 
pen register order under 18 U.S.C. § 3123. 
20. 
I further request, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3103a(b) and Federal Rule of Criminal 
Procedure 41(0(3), that the Court authorize the officer executing the warrant to delay notice until 
days from the end of the period of authorized surveillance. This delay is justified because 
there is reasonable cause to believe that providing immediate notification of the warrant may have 
an adverse result, as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 2705. Providing immediate notice to the subscriber 
or user of the Target Cellular Device would seriously jeopardize the ongoing investigation, as such 
a disclosure would give that person an opportunity to destroy evidence, change patterns of 
behavior, and flee from prosecution. See 18 U.S.C. § 3103a(b)(1). There is reasonable necessity 
for the use of the technique described above, for the reasons set forth above. See 18 U.S.C. § 
3103a(b)(2). 
21. 
I further request that the Court authorize execution of the warrant at any time of 
day or night, owing to the potential need to locate the Target Cellular Device outside of daytime 
hours. 
EFTA00018670
--- PAGE 9 ---
22. 
I further request that the Court order that all papers in support of this application, 
including the affidavit and search warrant, be sealed until further order of the Court. These 
documents discuss an ongoing criminal investigation that is neither public nor known to all of the 
targets of the investigation. Accordingly, there is good cause to seal these documents because 
their premature disclosure may seriously jeopardize that investigation. 
23. 
A search warrant may not be legally necessary to compel the investigative 
technique described herein. Nevertheless, I hereby submit this warrant application out of an 
abundance of caution. 
Respectfully Submitted, 
Special Agent 
Federal Bureau of Investigation 
The affiant appeared before me by telephonic conference on this date pursuant to Fed. R.

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 
Defendant. 
X 
SEALED 
INDICTMENT 
Cr. 
Cr. 330 
COUNT ONE 
(Conspiracy to Entice Minors to Travel to Engage in 
Illegal Sex Acts) 
The Grand Jury charges: 
OVERVIEW 
1. 
The charges set forth herein stem from the role 
of GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, in the sexual exploitation 
and abuse of multiple minor girls by Jeffrey Epstein. In 
particular, from at least in or about 1994, up to and including 
at least in or about 1997, MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and 
contributed to Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among 
other things, helping Epstein to recruit, groom, and ultimately 
abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age 
of 18. The victims were as young as 14 years old when they were 
groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
that certain victims were in fact under the age of 18. 
2. 
As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to 
abuse minor victims, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, and 
Jeffrey Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to 
EFTA00018677
--- PAGE 16 ---
Epstein's residences in different states, which MAXWELL knew and 
intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to 
sexual abuse. Moreover, in an effort to conceal her crimes, 
MAXWELL repeatedly lied when questioned about her conduct, 
including in relation to some of the minor victims described 
herein, when providing testimony under oath in 2016. 
FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
3. 
During the time periods charged in this 
Indictment, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, had a personal and 
professional relationship with Jeffrey Epstein and was among his 
closest associates. In particular, between in or about 1994 and 
in or about 1997, MAXWELL was in an intimate relationship with 
Epstein and also was paid by Epstein to manage his various 
properties. Over the course of their relationship, MAXWELL and 
Epstein were photographed together on multiple occasions, 
including in the below image: 
EFTA00018678
--- PAGE 17 ---
4. 
Beginning in at least 1994, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 
the defendant, enticed and groomed multiple minor girls to 
engage in sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein, through a variety of 
means and methods, including but not limited to the following: 
a. 
MAXWELL first attempted to befriend some of 
Epstein's minor victims prior to their abuse, including by 
asking the victims about their lives, their schools, and their 
families. MAXWELL and Epstein would spend time building 
friendships with minor victims by, for example, taking minor 
victims to the movies or shopping. Some of these outings would 
involve MAXWELL and Epstein spending time together with a minor 
victim, while some would involve MAXWELL or Epstein spending 
time alone with a minor victim. 
b. 
Having developed a rapport with a victim, 
MAXWELL would try to normalize sexual abuse for a minor victim 
by, among other things, discussing sexual topics, undressing in 
front of the victim, being present when a minor victim was 
undressed, and/or being present for sex acts involving the minor 
victim and Epstein. 
c. 
MAXWELL'S presence during minor victims' 
interactions with Epstein, including interactions where the 
minor victim was undressed or that involved sex acts with 
Epstein, helped put the victims at ease because an adult woman 
was present. For example, in some instances, MAXWELL would 
EFTA00018679
--- PAGE 18 ---
massage Epstein in front of a minor victim. In other instances, 
MAXWELL encouraged minor victims to provide massages to Epstein, 
including sexualized massages during which a minor victim would 
be fully or partially nude. Many of those massages resulted in 
Epstein sexually abusing the minor victims. 
d. 
In addition, Epstein offered to help some 
minor victims by paying for travel and/or educational 
opportunities, and MAXWELL encouraged certain victims to accept 
Epstein's assistance. As a result, victims were made to feel 
indebted and believed that MAXWELL and Epstein were trying to 
help them. 
e. 
Through this process, MAXWELL and Epstein 
enticed victims to engage in sexual activity with Epstein. In 
some instances, MAXWELL was present for and participated in the 
sexual abuse of minor victims. Some such incidents occurred in 
the context of massages, which developed into sexual encounters. 
5. 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, facilitated 
Jeffrey Epstein's access to minor victims knowing that he had a 
sexual preference for underage girls and that he intended to 
engage in sexual activity with those victims. Epstein's 
resulting abuse of minor victims included, among other things, 
touching a victim's breast, touching a victim's genitals, 
placing a sex toy such as a vibrator on a victim's genitals, 
EFTA00018680
--- PAGE 19 ---
directing a victim to touch Epstein while he masturbated, and 
directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. 
MAXWELL AND EPSTEIN'S VICTIMS 
6. 
Between approximately in or about 1994 and in or 
about 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, facilitated 
Jeffrey Epstein's access to minor victims by, among other 
things, inducing and enticing, and aiding and abetting the 
inducement and enticement of, multiple minor victims. Victims 
were groomed and/or abused at multiple locations, including the 
following: 
a. 
A a multi-story private residence on the 
Upper East Side of Manhattan, New York owned by Epstein (the 
"New York Residence"), which is depicted in the following 
photograph: 
EFTA00018681
--- PAGE 20 ---
b. 
An estate in Palm Beach, Florida owned by 
Epstein (the "Palm Beach Residence"), which is depicted in the 
following photograph: 
c. 
A ranch in Santa Fe, New Mexico owned by 
Epstein (the "New Mexico Residence"), which is depicted in the 
following photograph: 
EFTA00018682
--- PAGE 21 ---
d. 
MAXWELL's personal residence in London, 
England. 
7. 
Among the victims induced or enticed by GHISLAINE 
MAXWELL, the defendant, were minor victims identified herein as 
Minor Victim-1, Minor Victim-2, and Minor Victim-3. In 
particular, and during time periods relevant to this Indictment, 
MAXWELL engaged in the following acts, among others, with 
respect to minor victims: 
a. 
MAXWELL met Minor Victim-1 when Minor 
Victim-1 was approximately 14 years old. MAXWELL subsequently 
interacted with Minor Victim-1 on multiple occasions at 
Epstein's residences, knowing that Minor Victim-1 was under the 
age of 18 at the time. During these interactions, which took 
place between approximately 1994 and 1997, MAXWELL groomed Minor 
Victim-1 to engage in sexual acts with Epstein through multiple 
means. First, MAXWELL and Epstein attempted to befriend Minor 
Victim-1, taking her to the movies and on shopping trips. 
MAXWELL also asked Minor Victim-1 about school, her classes, her 
family, and other aspects of her life. MAXWELL then sought to 
normalize inappropriate and abusive conduct by, among other 
things, undressing in front of Minor Victim-1 and being present 
when Minor Victim-1 undressed ih front of Epstein. Within the 
first year after MAXWELL and Epstein met Minor Victim-1, Epstein 
began sexually abusing Minor Victim-1. MAXWELL was present for 
EFTA00018683
--- PAGE 22 ---
and involved in some of this abuse. In particular, MAXWELL 
involved Minor Victim-1 in group sexualized massages of Epstein. 
During those group sexualized massages, MAXWELL and/or Minor 
Victim-1 would engage in sex acts with Epstein. Epstein and 
MAXWELL both encouraged Minor Victim-1 to travel to Epstein's 
residences in both New York and Florida. As a result, Minor 
Victim-1 was sexually abused by Epstein in both New York and 
Florida. Minor Victim-1 was enticed to travel across state 
lines for the purpose of sexual encounters with Epstein, and 
MAXWELL was aware that Epstein engaged in sexual activity with 
Minor Victim-1 after Minor-Victim-1 traveled to Epstein's 
properties, including in the context of a sexualized massage. 
b. 
MAXWELL interacted with Minor Victim-2 on at 
least one occasion in or about 1996 at Epstein's residence in 
New Mexico when Minor Victim-2 was under the age of 18. Minor 
Victim-2 had flown into New Mexico from out of state at 
Epstein's invitation for the purpose of being groomed for and/or 
subjected to acts of sexual abuse. MAXWELL knew that Minor 
Victim-2 was under the age of 18 at the time. While in New 
Mexico, MAXWELL and Epstein took Minor Victim-2 to a movie and 
MAXWELL took Minor Victim-2 shopping. MAXWELL also discussed 
Minor Victim-2's school, classes, and family with Minor Victim-
2. In New Mexico, MAXWELL began her efforts to groom Minor 
Victim-2 for abuse by Epstein by, among other things, providing 
EFTA00018684
--- PAGE 23 ---
an unsolicited massage to Minor Victim-2, during which Minor 
Victim-2 was topless. MAXWELL also encouraged Minor Victim-2 to 
massage Epstein. 
c. 
MAXWELL groomed and befriended Minor 
Victim-3 in London, England between approximately 1994 and 1995, 
including during a period of time in which MAXWELL knew that 
Minor Victim-3 was under the age of 18. Among other things, 
MAXWELL discussed Minor Victim-3's life and family with Minor 
Victim-3. MAXWELL introduced Minor Victim-3 to Epstein and 
arranged for multiple interactions between Minor Victim-3 and 
Epstein. During those interactions, MAXWELL encouraged Minor 
Victim-3 to massage Epstein, knowing that Epstein would engage 
in sex acts with Minor Victim-3 during those massages. Minor 
Victim-3 provided Epstein with the requested massages, and 
during those massages, Epstein sexually abused Minor Victim-3. 
MAXWELL was aware that Epstein engaged in sexual activity with 
Minor Victim-3 on multiple occasions, including at times when 
Minor Victim-3 was under the age of 18, including in the context 
of a sexualized massage. 
MAXWELL'S EFFORTS TO CONCEAL HER CONDUCT 
8. 
In or around 2016, in the context of a deposition 
as part of civil litigation, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, 
repeatedly provided false and perjurious statements, under oath, 
regarding, among other subjects, her role in facilitating the 
EFTA00018685
--- PAGE 24 ---
abuse of minor victims by Jeffrey Epstein, including some of the 
specific events and acts of abuse detailed above. 
STATUTORY ALLEGATIONS 
9. 
From at least in or about 1994, up to and 
including in or about 1997, in the Southern District of New York 
and elsewhere, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, Jeffrey 
Epstein, and others known and unknown, willfully and knowingly 
did combine, conspire, confederate, and agree together and with 
each other to commit an offense against the United States, to 
wit, enticement, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, 
Section 2422. 
10. It was a part and object of the conspiracy that 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, and others 
known and unknown, would and did knowingly persuade, induce, 
entice, and coerce one and more individuals to travel in 
interstate and foreign commerce, to engage in sexual activity 
for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense, in 
violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 2422. 
Overt Acts 
11. In furtherance of the conspiracy and to effect 
the illegal object thereof, the following overt acts, among 
others, were committed in the Southern District of New York and 
elsewhere: 
EFTA00018686
--- PAGE 25 ---

--- PAGE 2 ---
INTRODUCTION 
Ghislaine Maxwell respectfully submits this Memorandum in Support of her Third 
Motion for Release on Bail. 
As Ms. Maxwell has stated on numerous occasions and reaffirms here: she has no 
intention or desire to leave this country. She is an American citizen, has lived in United States 
for 30 years, has strong family ties and the support of friends and family residing in this country. 
She wants nothing more than to remain in the United States under whatever conditions the Court 
deems necessary so that she can effectively prepare for trial and vigorously defend against the 
25-year-old charges in the Indictment. Ms. Maxwell has already proposed an expansive and, to 
our knowledge, unprecedented set of bail conditions that would reasonably assure her 
appearance. (See Dkt. 97.) In light of the Court's denial of that application (see Dkt. 106), Ms. 
Maxwell now proposes two additional bail conditions to supplement the extraordinarily 
restrictive bail package she has already offered. 
• 
First, Ms. Maxwell will renounce her French and British citizenship to eliminate 
any opportunity for her to seek refuge in those countries, if the Court so requires. 
• 
Second, Ms. Maxwell will have her and her spouse's assets—excluding funds 
earmarked for living expenses, for legal fees and other expenses necessary to 
defend her against the criminal charges in this case and related civil lawsuits and 
for taxes—placed in a new account that will be monitored by a retired federal 
District Court judge and former United States Attorney who will function as asset 
monitor and will have co-signing authority over the account. 
The former condition goes well beyond the extradition waivers that the Court deemed 
insufficient and should satisfy any concerns the Court may have that Ms. Maxwell may try to 
seek a safe haven in France or the United Kingdom. (See id. at 11-13). As a non-citizen, Ms. 
Maxwell will not be able to avail herself of any protections against extradition that may apply to 
EFTA00018710
--- PAGE 3 ---
citizens of those countries. The latter condition will restrain Ms. Maxwell's assets so they 
cannot be used for flight or harboring her outside of the jurisdiction of this Court. This should 
satisfy the Court's concern that the proposed bond was not fully secured and left assets 
unrestrained that could be used for such purposes. (See id. at 17-18). 
In addition, since the last bail application, Ms. Maxwell has submitted twelve pretrial 
motions that raise substantial legal and factual issues that may result in the dismissal of some or 
all of the charges against her. Ms. Maxwell referenced some of these motions in her initial bail 
application (see Dkt. 18 at 19) but was not in a position to fully articulate them until she had the 
chance to review the discovery and research the legal issues in advance of the motion deadline of 
January 25. These motions significantly call into question the strength of the government's case 
against Ms. Maxwell and the underlying justification for continued detention. 
Ms. Maxwell has already been denied a fair chance in the court of public opinion. She 
has been maligned by the media, which has perpetuated a false narrative about her that has 
poisoned any open-mindedness and impartiality of a potential jury. She has been relentlessly 
attacked with vicious slurs, persistent lies, and blatant inaccuracies by spokespeople who have 
neither met nor spoken to her. She has been depicted as a cartoon-character villain in an attempt 
to turn her into a substitute replacement for Jeffrey Epstein. Yet, Ms. Maxwell is determined — 
and welcomes the opportunity — to face her accusers at trial and clear her name. The additional 
proposed bail conditions should quell any concerns that she would try to flee. The Court should 
therefore grant bail under the proposed conditions so that Ms. Maxwell can adequately prepare 
for trial. 
EFTA00018711
--- PAGE 4 ---
I. 
The Proposed Additional Bail Conditions Will Reasonably Assure Ms. Maxwell's 
Appearance in Court 
As set forth above, Ms. Maxwell now proposes two additional restrictions that eliminate 
any means or opportunity that she may have to leave the country. The Court should therefore 
reconsider its earlier ruling and grant bail under the proposed conditions. See United States v. 
Rowe, No. 02 CR. 756 LMM, 2003 WL 21196846, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. May 21, 2003) (IA] release 
order may be reconsidered even where the evidence proffered on reconsideration was known to 
the movant at the time of the original hearing."); see also United States v. Petrov, No. 15-CR-66-
LTS, 2015 WL 11022886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2015) (noting "Court's inherent authority for 
reconsideration of the Court's previous bail decision"). 
A. 
Renunciation of Foreign Citizenship 
To demonstrate her commitment to abide by her conditions of release and to provide 
further assurance to the Court that she will not attempt to leave the country, Ms. Maxwell is 
willing to formally renounce her foreign citizenships in France and the United Kingdom. Should 
the Court feel this drastic condition is necessary, the required documents will be submitted to the 
appropriate authorities. Moreover, as a standard condition of bail, all of Ms. Maxwell's 
passports will be surrendered to the government and no further application will be made. 
If the Court deems it a necessary condition of release, Ms. Maxwell will formally 
commence the procedure to renounce her foreign citizenship. The requisite paperwork is in the 
process of being completed. Renunciation of UK citizenship can be accomplished immediately 
upon granting of bail. The process of renouncing her French citizenship, while not immediate, 
may be expedited. 
Citizenship is a precious and priceless asset. Ms. Maxwell's decision to give up 
citizenship from the county of her birth and the country of her upbringing demonstrates her 
EFTA00018712

earnestness to abide by the conditions of her release and underscores that she has no intention to 
flee and reflects her deep need to communicate freely with counsel to prepare for her defense. 
Her renunciation of foreign citizenship obviates the Court's concerns about the validity of 
waivers of extradition. (See Dkt. 106 at 13). Ms. Maxwell will have no ability to contest 
extradition from France or the United Kingdom on the basis of citizenship, which removes any 
incentive the Court and government believe she may have to seek refuge in those countries. 
B. 
Restraint and Monitoring of Assets 
In denying bail, the Court noted that the bond was not fully secured, and that Ms. 
Maxwell and her spouse would still have several million dollars in unrestrained assets that could 
be used to facilitate her flight from the country. (See id. at 17-18). To assuage any concerns that 
those assets would be available to finance flight to and shelter in a foreign country, Ms. Maxwell 
has taken steps to create a monitorship that will place meaningful restraints on the assets that are 
not used to secure the bond, while still allowing Ms. Maxwell to pay for her legal defense, for 
her spouse to pay for daily living expenditures and for payment of taxes. 
1. 
New Account 
All assets of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse, with the exception of money currently held in 
escrow for legal fees and related defense expenses and the funds contained in the bank account in 
the name of Ms. Maxwell's spouse ("the Personal Account")', will be deposited in a newly 
created account ("the New Account") to be overseen by an asset monitor appointed pursuant to 
order of the Court. The New Account will contain all of Ms. Maxwell's and her spouse's 
remaining cash and other liquid assets, including any proceeds that result from the pending sale 
The Personal Account is identified as Account Ion page 9 of the Financial Report annexed to Ms. Maxwell's 
Renewed Bail Application. (See Dkt. 97, Exhibit 0.) 
EFTA00018713
--- PAGE 6 ---
of Ms. Maxwell's London house and any other assets, excluding salary, hereinafter acquired. 
The asset manager will approve the financial institution at which the New Account is created and 
must approve and co-sign any expenditure from the New Account, with the exception of 
disbursements for Ms. Maxwell's legal fees in connection with the ongoing criminal and civil 
litigation and for payment of taxes, which will not require authorization. No illiquid assets may 
be sold, conveyed or transferred without approval of the asset monitor. 
2. 
Other Assets 
The only funds that will not be included in the New Account are (I) the money currently 
held in escrow by Ms. Maxwell's attorneys, which will be used exclusively for her defense; and 
(2) the roughly $450,000 in the Personal Account which her spouse will use only for living 
expenses. The asset monitor shall regularly receive information regarding activity of the Personal 
Account, including the account balance, on a weekly basis. The asset monitor must also receive 
five-day advance notice of any check, on-line payment, or transfer of funds in any amount 
exceeding $5,000, and the reason for such payment. Ms. Maxwell's spouse agrees to be bound 
by these restrictions and reporting requirements. 
The asset monitor shall report to Pretrial Services any possible non-compliance or 
disbursement in violation of the terms and conditions specified above. 
3. 
Selected Asset Monitor 
The Honorable William S. Duffey, Jr., a retired federal District Court judge and the 
former United States Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia, has agreed to undertake the 
position of asset monitor. (Judge Duffey's bio is attached as Exhibit A.) Judge Duffey has 
extensive experience evaluating and monitoring funds held in and disbursed from financial 
EFTA00018714
--- PAGE 7 ---
accounts and will be entrusted with the authority to oversee the assets of Ms. Maxwell and her 
spouse, as described above. 
Restraining Ms. Maxwell's assets that are not used to secure the bond and placing them under 
the supervision of a former federal District Court judge eliminates any concern that such funds 
could be used to violate the terms of release. 
H. 
Ms. Maxwell's Pretrial Motions Raise Substantial Legal and Factual Issues 
That Could Result in Dismissal of Some or All of the Charges Against Her 
In addition to the new conditions proposed above, the numerous substantive pretrial 
motions now before the Court amply challenge the purported strength of the government's case. 
Ms. Maxwell's pretrial motions raise serious legal issues that could result in dismissal of 
charges, if not the entire indictment. Among the dozen submissions are motions to dismiss the 
superseding indictment for breach of the non-prosecution agreement, for pre-indictment delay, 
and for being based on improperly obtained evidence in violation of Ms. Maxwell's 
constitutional rights under the Fifth and Sixth the Amendments. Other motions seek dismissal of 
the Mann Act charges as being time-barred and the perjury charges as based on non-perjurious 
statements. These motions are substantial with a likelihood of success on the merits. These 
motions cast substantial doubt on the alleged strength of the government's case and warrant 
granting bail on the conditions proposed. 
III. 
The Court Should Grant Bail 
Under the Bail Reform Act of 1984, a defendant must be released on personal 
recognizance or unsecured personal bond unless the judicial officer determines "that such release 
will not reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required or will endanger the safety of 
any other person or the community." 18 U.S.C. § 3142(b). The enhanced bail package proposed 
by Ms. Maxwell contains financial burdens and a combination of restrictions that reasonably 
EFTA00018715
--- PAGE 8 ---
assure her appearance as required. Before preventive detention may be ordered under § 3142(e), 
the Court is obliged to determine both whether the defendant is likely to flee the jurisdiction if 
released, and whether any conditions of release will be reasonably certain to guard against this 
propensity to flee. The Court expressed concerns and denied bail without indicating what 
conditions would be reasonably certain to assure Ms. Maxwell's appearance. Ms. Maxwell is no 
danger to the community and not alleged to have been involved in ongoing criminal activity. To 
say that there are absolutely no conditions flies in the face of cases where non-United States 
citizens with no ties to the district, let alone the country, were released on lesser conditions for 
alleged criminality ongoing up to or within hours of the time of arrest, in contrast to 26-year-old 
claims alleged against Ms. Maxwell.' 
The additional conditions set forth above, which supplement the exceptional bail package 
previously proposed, are sufficient to address the hypothetical risk of flight and secure Ms. 
Maxwell's presence at trial. The financial magnitude of the proposed bonds, the collateral 
pledged to secure the bonds, the stringent requirements of home detention, the renunciation of 
foreign citizenship and monitoring of assets contained in a special account from which no funds 
can be withdrawn without the approval and signature of a retired federal District Court judge and 
former United States Attorney are conditions that amply satisfy the concerns expressed by the 
government and the Court. These cnditions are unique and unprecedented. They profoundly 
See Dkt. 97 at 34 (case-comparison chart in the Renewed Motion for Bail); cf. People v. Dominique Strauss-Kahn, 
02526/201I(S.Ct. N.Y. County). Strauss-Kahn, a French citizen with no ties to the United States, was arrested on a 
Paris-bound flight at JFK minutes before takeoff and later charged with several counts of sexual assault, including 
felony charges punishable up to 25 years imprisonment, for sexual assault and attempted rape of a Manhattan hotel 
housekeeper on the day of his arrest. The accusations were corroborated by semen containing Strauss-Kahn's DNA 
on the accuser's uniform. The New York State Supreme Court granted bail in the amount of $1 million cash, 24-
hour home detention electronic monitoring ankle bracelet, and private 24/7 security guards. After surrendering his 
French passport and posting an additional $5 million bail bond, Strauss-Kahn was placed under house arrest in a 
residence in Manhattan. See https://www.theguardian.comAvorld/20 
 may/20/dominique-strauss-kahn-new-york-
apartment. 
EFTA00018716
--- PAGE 9 ---
affirm Ms. Maxwell's earnestness in seeking bail to properly prepare her defense, not to flee. 
The Court should grant bail to Ghislaine Maxwell. 
CONCLUSION 
The proposed additional conditions of release—renunciation of foreign citizenship and 
restraint and monitoring of assets by a retired District Court judge—enhance the already 
extraordinarily restrictive bail conditions proposed in Ms. Maxwell's Renewed Motion for Bail. 
In combination, these conditions satisfy the Bail Reform Act and reasonably assure Ms. 
Maxwell's appearance at trial. To deny Ms. Maxwell bail when such extraordinary and 
restrictive conditions are available would be a miscarriage of justice.

I hereby inform you that in France, all removal proceedings and conditions are 
governed by Articles 696 et sq. of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 
Article 696-2 of said Code provides that: "The French government is able to remit to 
foreign governments upon their request any individual who is not a French citizen and who is subject to a 
lawsuit brought on behalf of the requesting State, or who is subject to a sentence passed by the Court of said 
requesting State, and who is located on the territory of the French Republic." 
Article 694-4 expressly specifies as follows: 
"Removal is not granted: 
I - When the individual claimed to have French citizenship, said citizenship having been 
assessed at the time of the offense on the basis of which removal is being 
requested." 
WHEREBY, the fact that the wanted individual is a French national constitutes an 
insuperable obstacle to his/her removal. As long as said nationality is assessed at the time the 
offense was committed, any loss of nationality subsequent to said offense has no bearing upon 
the removal proceedings and shall not supersede said assessment of nationality.

Hey,

Would you mind sending us the briefing you guys did on not identifying the victims early in Epstein/ Maxwell? 
The Justice Dept in Canada is requesting a "publication ban" which would stop defense counsel from identifying 
victims in the extradition case and asked us for a letter. Obviously the posture is different but it would be helpful 
to see what you highlighted.

does not track FOIA requests to, e.g., the FBI, that end up in litigation in the SDNY and that our Civ Div

Hope you're doing well.-am 
nd I are trying to assemble a list of every FOIA request our office has ever 
received (at any point) relating to Jeffrey Epstein and/or Ghislaine Maxwell. 
suggested that you'd be the 
best point of contact to help us figure this out. Could you please send us the following information: 
• A list of all FOIA requests our office has received; 
• For each case, whether a production was made in response to the request; and 
• Who the AUSA point of contact for the request is. 
That would be a big help. Please let us know if you need any information from us to run the search. 
Thanks very much,

Dear Judge Nathan, 
Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell, pursuant to paragraph 18 of this Court's Protective Order (Doc. 
# 36), requests that the Court enter an Order allowing her to refer to and file under seal in Giuffre 
v. Maxwell, 15-cv-5433 (LAP), and a related Second Circuit appeal, Giuffre v. Maxwell, No. 20-
2413 (the "Other Matters"), certain discovery materials produced by the government on August 
5, 2020. She also seeks to refer to (but not file) discovery materials produced by the government 
on August 13, 2020, specifically the 90,000 pages of documents received from Boies Schiller & 
Flexner, which appears to include their entire civil file from the Giuffre case. 2
Disclosure to the judicial officers in the Other Matters is necessary for fair determination of 
important issues impacting the privacy and due process rights of Ms. Maxwell and other third 
parties. The ten discrete items to be filed ("the Material") are not confidential and disclosure 
confined to the Honorable Loretta Preska and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, under seal, 
' Ms. Maxwell seeks leave to file this Letter Motion under seal because it relates and refers to 
discovery materials deemed Confidential under the terms of the Protective Order in this case. 
'Counsel for Ms. Maxwell have not conducted a document by document comparison of the 
90,000 pages with documents in their possession related to the Maxwell civil matters but presumes they 
are the same. Paragraph 16 of the Protective Order in this case exempts information obtained "from a 
source other than the government." Because Ms. Maxwell has not yet compared the two sets of 
documents she makes this request out of an abundance of caution.

will not prejudice the government? The items to be referred to (and not filed) are confidential; 
accordingly, referring to them under seal in the Other Matters will not prejudice the government. 
Relevant Facts and Procedural History 
The defamation action and its Protective Order- Giuffre v. Maxwell 
In 2015, 'alleged 
in a civil suit that Ms. Maxwell defamed her, based on a 
statement from Ms. Maxwell's attorney-hired press agent generally denying as "untrue" and 
"obvious lies'as 
allegations that Ms. Maxwell participated in a scheme causing her to be 
"sexually abused and trafficked" by Jeffrey Epstein. Given the amount of personal, confidential 
material and information sought in discovery, the district court entered a stipulated Protective 
Order protecting confidential information from public disclosure. See Giuffre v. Maxwell, 15-cv-
7433 (Doc. # 62).4 The language agreed upon, and made an order of the district court, 
specifically excluded an exception for law enforcement. Ms. Maxwell shortly thereafter 
submitted to a deposition in reliance on the Protective Order; she also was compelled to — and 
did — sit for a second deposition in July 2016. A year later and literally days before trial, the 
parties agreed to a settlement of the defamation claim and the case was dismissed. 
The Jane Doe 43 matter 
On January 26, 2017, plaintiff Jane Doe 43 sued various individuals including Ms. Maxwell. A 
Protective Order substantially similar to the Protective Order entered in Giuffre v. Maxwell was 
entered by Magistrate Judge Netburn on November 29, 2018.5 That matter was settled and 
dismissed on December 20, 2018. Jane Doe 43 also was represented by BSF, the same lawyers 
who represent 
The Materials to be filed are attached, under seal, as exhibits 1-10. Although marked by the 
government as "Confidential," the Materials are not "Confidential" as that term has been defined by the 
Second Circuit. They consist of ex pane pleadings filed by the government, ex pane transcripts, and ex 
pane rulings. Boies, Schiller & Flexner ("BSF') lawyers, cooperating with the government, are aware of 
the Material. The Second Circuit has characterized these types of documents as "judicial documents" with 
a presumptive right of public access. See Brown v. Maxwell, 929 F.3d 41, 47 (2d Cir. 2019). Ms. Maxwell 
objected to the government's Confidential designation, under paragraph 9 of the Protective Order, and 
requested that the government withdraw the designation. The Court does not need to decide the issue of 
whether the Material is confidential at this time given that Ms. Maxwell seeks only to provide the 
Material to judicial officers under seal as information necessary to fairly decide pending issues in those 
cases. 
Plaintiff originally proposed protective order language that would have allowed for a "law 
enforcement" exception. In particular, Paragraph l(a)4 of the draft proposed that "CONFIDENTIAL 
information shall not be disclosed or used for any purpose except the preparation and trial of this case and 
any related matter, including but not limited to, investigations by law enforcement." See Giuffre v. 
Maxwell, 15-cv-7433 (Doc. # 1078-4 at 4). Ms. Maxwell and her counsel rejected this proposed language 
because of her concerns that plaintiff and her lawyers were acting as either express or de facto agents of 
the government.

The motion to unseal and the first appeal 
One year after Giuffre v. Maxwell was dismissed and closed, the Miami Herald sought to reopen 
the case and to unseal every sealed filing on the district court docket. The district court denied 
the motion to unseal. The Miami Herald appealed on September 28, 2018. 
On July 3, 2019 the Second Circuit reversed Judge Sweet's ruling. Brown v. Maxwell, 929 F.3d 
41, 44-45 (2d Cir. 2019). Upon the issuance of the mandate, on August 9, 2019, it largely 
unsealed the summary judgment materials to the public and the press and remanded the case to 
the district court to conduct a particularized review of the remaining records. Id. at 53-54. 
The remand and the unsealing process. 
On July 9, the Giuffre case was assigned to the Honorable Loretta Preska who was charged with 
the difficult and time consuming task of sorting through thousands of filings, determining what 
documents were "judicial," what were not, determining the process to notify the hundreds of 
non-parties about their right to object to the disclosure of their confidential information, and 
implementing a protocol for maintaining or unsealing the sealed status of thousands of pages of 
material. Judge Preska sought input from the various Does, the lawyers for 
primarily 
Sigrid McCawley, a partner at BSF, and counsel for Ms. Maxwell. Judge Preska was obligated 
by the Brown Court first to identify what was or was not a "judicial document"; second, to 
determine the presumption of access to the document; and third, to identify and weigh numerous 
factors for or against unsealing a judicial document. Since August 2019, this process has 
consumed hundreds, if not thousands, of lawyer, court, and staff hours. 
On July 23, 2020, Judge Preska, over Ms. Maxwell's objection, ordered the unsealing of her 
April 2016 deposition transcript and the deposition transcript of John Doe 1. On July 30, 2020, 
Ms. Maxwell filed a notice of appeal to the Second Circuit and an emergency motion with the 
Second Circuit to stay the unsealing order pending appeal. See Giuffre v. Maxwell, No. 20-2413, 
Doc. # 10 (2d. Cir.) (Maxwell Emergency Motion for Stay). When Judge Preska ordered the 
unsealing of Ms. Maxwell's deposition on July 23 and denied Ms. Maxwell's motion to 
reconsider on July 30, she apparently did not know that, as described below, Chief Judge 
McMahon had already granted an ex pane request from the government to obtain Ms. Maxwell's 
deposition (among thousands of other confidential and sealed materials that were protected under 
the Protection Order from disclosures to non-parties) and that Magistrate Judge Netburn had 
denied such a request from the government. Ms. Maxwell and her attorneys did not know 
anything about the government's request for access to these materials. 
On July 31, 2020, the Second Circuit stayed Judge Preska's order unsealing Ms. Maxwell and 
John Doe 1's deposition transcripts. The Court ordered an expedited briefing schedule. Ms. 
Maxwell's opening brief is due on August 20, 2020. Oral argument is September 22, 2020. 
The Material 
The government apparently contacted BSF at some time before February 2019 while the Second 
Circuit appeal of Judge Sweet's order was pending. Based on some discussion with an as-yet 
unidentified BSF lawyer, the government served BSF with a subpoena to produce (apparently) 
all the BSF litigation files pertaining to both civil litigations. Ms. Maxwell was not served with 
EFTA00018751
--- PAGE 4 ---
The Honorable Alison J. Nathan 
August 17, 2020 
Page 4 
any subpoena. According to the government, "although [BSF] would not otherwise contest 
compliance with the Subpoena, [BSF] believe[d] that the Protective Order preclude[d] [BSF] 
from complying." See Exhibits 1 at p. 2 II 3 and 2, q 5. 
In or about February 28, 2019 the government first applied to Judge Sweet for relief. The 
government pressed its request in late March 2019 to Chief Judge McMahon and in April to 
Magistrate Judge Netburn. During these ex parte proceedings, the government made numerous 
unchallenged factual assertions. To Ms. Maxwell's knowledge, no one disclosed the pendency of 
these applications to any judicial officer associated with the appeal or the unsealing process. 
Certainly, no one -- not the government, any court, or any lawyer at BSF -- disclosed to Ms. 
Maxwell that, while the issues surrounding the unsealing of thousands of confidential documents 
were being litigated in the Second Circuit, BSF and the government were secretly working 
together to "modify" the Protective Orders so that the government could gain access to the 
materials subject to the Protective Orders. 
Over the last year, none of the filings submitted to any court involved in the sanctioned, public 
unsealing process hints at the fact that, even though Ms. Maxwell and numerous Does were 
contesting the release of the confidential information in the Second Circuit, BSF had already 
turned over (apparently) all of the confidential information to the government, as well as all of 
the discovery produced by Ms. Maxwell and numerous non-parties. Ms. Maxwell assumes that, 
to this day, Judge Preska has never been told that the government was given all the material as 
part of the Martindell-avoidance, ex pane processes in front of Judges Sweet, McMahon, and 
Netbum. 
The indictment with reference to sealed materials 
On July 2, 2020, one day after Ms. Maxwell filed her Reply concerning the unsealing of 
approximately 5,000 pages of material in the civil matter including her deposition, the 
government arrested Ms. Maxwell. On July 8, the government filed a superseding indictment 
alleging that Ms. Maxwell "assisted, facilitated, and contributed" to Epstein's abuse of minors. 
Regarding the civil action, the indictment alleges that in 2016 Ms. Maxwell made "efforts to 
conceal her conduct" by "repeatedly provid[ing] false and perjurious statements" in deposition 
testimony. Superseding Indictment, Doc. # 17 at 29 II 8. 
Ms. Maxwell first learned on August 7, 20206 how the government obtained the sealed 
transcripts. On the two applications referenced above (one before Chief Judge McMahon and the 
other before Magistrate Judge Netburn), the two SDNY courts rendered a split decision. Judge

The first batch of discovery was provided by the government to NY counsel on August 5, 2020 
in the late afternoon on a hard disk. Due to the time upload and securely transfer files, undersigned 
counsel for Ms. Maxwell (also counsel for her in the Giuffre case) only received these materials at 11:38 
a.m. on Friday, August 7, 2020.

pane application. Magistrate Judge Netburn denied the application. Both courts reached different 
results applying the same authority.' 
Counsel for Ms. Maxwell then learned, on August 14, 2020, that BSF has produced 90,000 pages 
of discovery from BSF, including their entire civil file comprised not only of sealed judicial 
documents but all of the discovery produced by Ms. Maxwell and numerous non-parties in the 
Giuffre case. As the Second Circuit has already held, much of the discovery was compelled, and 
responses provided, based on the promise of confidentiality by the Giuffre Protective Order. See 
Brown, 929 F.3d 41, n. 22 & 51. 
The pressing issue that necessitates the filing of this request concerns Ms. Maxwell's due process 
right to fairly litigate issues in the rapidly unfolding unsealing litigation and related appeal. 
These issues, in turn, impact her rights as the accused in this matter, constitutionally presumed 
innocent unless and until the government proves her guilt beyond all reasonable doubt. 
The Protective Order in this case 
The Protective Order in this case prohibits the use of the discovery materials or confidential-
designated materials "for any civil proceeding or any purpose other than the defense of this 
action" absent mutual agreement in writing between the government and defense counsel or if 
"modified by further order of the Court." Doc. # 36 at 
1(a), 10(a), 18. Ms. Maxwell agreed to 
that limitation after assurances by the government, consistent with their representation to this 
Court, that "the Government rarely provides any third party, including a witness, with any 
material they did not already possess," and therefore "concerns defense counsel raises about 
future use in civil litigation are not likely to occur." Letter of Alex Rossmiller at 6 (Doc. # 33) 
(July 28, 2020). This Court relied on that representation in its ruling that government witnesses 
should not be limited in their use of materials gained from the government in any related civil 
litigation. Memorandum Op'n & Order at 3 (July 30, 2020). Yet as described above, the 
government must have given a copy of the sealed order to BSF, BSF has now used that (or its 
omission) to their tactical advantage in the Giuffre unsealing process, and Ms. Maxwell is unable 
to respond to the judicial officers with the complete truth. 
Paragraph 18 of the Protective Order permits modification by the Court. Further, any concerns 
that the government may raise concerning their on-going grand jury investigation will be 
obviated by submission of these materials under seal in the other matters. 
The reasons this Court should grant the request 
In contravention of Martindell and its progeny, the government achieved modification of a valid 
protective order entered in connection with settled civil litigation. Knowing that significant 
issues relating to the confidences and identities of multiple deponents and other innocents were 
being actively litigated, it appears that the government worked in tandem with BSF to secretly 
obtain tens of thousands of pages of confidential information, discovery, and sealed materials. 
The controlling authority relied on by both courts to reach opposite results is Martindell v. 
International Telephone and Telegraph Corp., 594 F.2d 291, 293 (2d Cir. 1979). 
EFTA00018753
--- PAGE 6 ---
The Honorable Alison J. Nathan 
August 17, 2020 
Page 6 
There are at least three compelling reasons to modify the Protective Order. First, Judge Preska 
might well decline to unseal Ms. Maxwell's depositions if she knew how the government 
obtained it despite the Protective Order. We do not know what impact the government's 
possession of the BSF file may have on the carefully crafted unsealing process. Judge Preska has 
jurisdiction over the Protective Order entered in the Giuffre v. Maxwell case. Issues related to the 
administration of that Protective Order should be litigated in that forum. There is a compelling 
need for Ms. Maxwell to be able to advise Judge Preska about the Material so that she and the 
non-parties can fairly adjudicate the multiple issues being addressed in the unsealing process. 
Judge Preska might decide that disclosure to the government obviates the need for further 
analysis of the remaining documents. 
The partial secrecy surrounding the Material has also fundamentally undermined the fairness of 
the adversarial process. Although the grand jury subpoena and government investigation were 
known to opposing civil counsel BSF, they failed to move for a modification of the Protective 
Order as contemplated by Martindell or disclose the material fact that these items had been 
handed over to the government months ago. 
Any suggestion that BSF's obligations regarding candor to the tribunal was somehow limited by 
the Fed. R. Crim.P. 6(e) is misplaced. "The rule does not impose any obligation of secrecy on 
witnesses." Fed. R. Crim. P. 6, Advisory Committee Note to Subdivision 6(e)2. Indeed, 
Martindell expressly contemplated that an affected party would have the ability to move to quash 
any subpoena issued by a grand jury that would implicate his or her rights under a valid 
protective order. Martindell, 524 F.2d at 294. Too many questions remain unanswered 
including exactly what was said between the government and BSF, when was it said, and 
precisely what was turned over. In the Giuffre v. Maxwell litigation, certain orders entered by 
Judge Sweet restricted certain information to "attorney eyes only." Without the ability to use the 
Material in the very limited fashion proposed Ms. Maxwell she is unfairly disadvantaged in the 
process. Moreover, instead of candidly revealing the fact of the subpoena and production, the 
BSF lawyers misleadingly suggested to the courts that Ms. Maxwell's concerns about an 
investigation were fabricated. 
Second, following the revelation that the government had already obtained her deposition 
through an ex parte proceeding, Ms. Maxwell moved Judge Preska to temporarily stay the 
unsealing process. See Giuffre v. Maxwell, 15-cv-7433 (Doc. # 1100). But because of the 
Protective Order in this case, Ms. Maxwell could not inform Judge Preska of what she knew. On 
August 12, Judge Preska denied the motion to stay, finding that: "Given that Ms. Maxwell is not 
at liberty to disclose this new information because it is subject to the protective order in the 
criminal action, . . . the Court has no reasonable basis to impose a stay." See Giuffre v. Maxwell, 
15-cv-7433 (Doc. # 1103) Unless this Court modifies the Protective Order, Judge Preska will 
continue to remain in the dark, and Ms. Maxwell will be deprived of a fair opportunity to seek a 
stay of the unsealing process. The unsealing process in Giuffre is moving ahead to other 
pleadings and exhibits, which include Ms. Maxwell's July 2016 deposition, also sealed and a 
part of the indictment in this case. Without modification of this Protective Order, Ms. Maxwell 
EFTA00018754
--- PAGE 7 ---
The Honorable Alison J. Nathan 
August 17, 2020 
Page 7 
will not be able to articulate her many concerns fully and fairly about the unsealing of that 
deposition to Judge Preska. 
Further, and as this Court knows, ample Second Circuit authority supports staying a civil case 
pending the resolution of a related criminal case. See SEC v. Blaszczak, No. 17-CV-3919 (MN), 
2018 WL 301091, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 3, 2018) (granting motion to stay civil case and holding 
that "[a] district court may stay civil proceedings when related criminal proceedings are 
imminent or pending, and it will sometimes be prudential to do so" (quoting Louis Vuitton 
Ma!leder S.A. v. LY USA, Inc., 676 F.3d 83, 98 (2d Cir. 2012))). Among other things, the stay 
vindicates the Fifth Amendment and guards against witnesses learning information in the civil 
case and then "conforming" their testimony in the criminal case to what was disclosed in the 
civil case. This concern is all the more real when one law firm, BSF, is in possession of these 
sealed materials representing accusers who may be witnesses in this case. The concern becomes 
exponentially magnified when the accusers are purporting to recall and relate memories for 
events that allegedly occurred decades ago, and their credibility will be a central challenge at the 
criminal trial. 
Ms. Maxwell further anticipates the very immediate need to disclose the Materials to the Second 
Circuit Court of Appeals in connection with her appeal of Judge Preska's unsealing order, since 
the appellate opening brief due on August 20, 2020. Again, disclosure is necessary to correct the 
misleading statements of opposing counsel and to frame the issues related to the unsealing 
orders. 
Notably, the Material at issue is not accuser-related or sensitive in any regard. These ex parte 
pleadings, hearings, and rulings are already known to the BSF lawyers. These materials, absent 
sealing, would enjoy a presumptive right of public access as judicial documents. Given that the 
Material has been disclosed in this case by the government under the terms of this Court's 
Order, and without any application to the sealing courts, the government has conceded that this 
Court has the authority to authorize use of the Material under the terms of this Court's Protective 
Order. And, the government has previously agreed that the appropriate forum to consider issues 
related to the civil Protective Order is in the civil litigation, positing the opinion "that neither it 
nor this Court is well-positioned to, or should, become the arbiter of what is appropriate or 
permissible in civil cases." Doc. # 33 at 7. What Ms. Maxwell asks is that she be allowed to 
disclose, under seal, the Material so that she can advise the appropriate arbiters about 
information already known to but not disclosed by her opponent. 
The Protective Order in this case should not preclude judicial review by other Article III 
judicial officers 
The Material, as part of the court files in the United States District Court for the Southern 
District of New York, may be judicially noticed by either Judge Preska or the Second Circuit 
Court of Appeals. See FRE 201; Hong Mai Sa v. Doe, 406 F.3d 155, 158 (2d Cir. 2005) (the 
Second Circuit Court of Appeals can take judicial notice of its own files as well as those of the 
district court); In re Pruitt, 72 B.R. 436, 440 (Banks. E.D.N.Y. 1987) (a bankruptcy court may 
EFTA00018755
--- PAGE 8 ---
The Honorable Alison J. Nathan 
August 17, 2020 
Page 8 
take judicial notice of the contents of its own files proceeding and the case in which an adversary 
proceeding arose).8
The Protective Order restricts Ms. Maxwell from asking the Courts to exercise this authority or 
direct the Courts to the applicable miscellaneous actions. Given that the appellate court and 
district court are authorized to review, and are capable of reviewing, the Material it is illogical 
and unjust that Ms. Maxwell be prohibited from referencing the Material in the civil litigation. 
Conclusion 
Ms. Maxwell requests that this Court modify the Protective Order to allow her to refer to and file 
under seal in Giuffre v. Maxwell, 15-cv-5433 (LAP), and the related Second Circuit appeal, 
Giuffre v. Maxwell, No. 20-2413, the Material at issue in this letter motion.

• AUSAs reviewed scans of full Florida FBI file on Relativity. From that review, we identified handwritten notes and 
302 reflecting a single interview occurring on or about August 7, 2007 with Florida FBI agents. 
• AUSAs and paralegals reviewed scans of full SDFL file on Relativity. From that review, we identified no record of any 
additional interviews with la. 
• AUSAs conducted a keyword search of AUSA 
email inbox, which included the search terms "Jane Doe," 
a,"

From that review, we identified no record of any additional interviews with

Hi 
I do not have any travel plans during the month of August, nor does 
. September is a 
busy month with two trials set, and I will be traveling out of the country from Sept 17-30, but I 
will do everything to be as flexible as possible. 
Thanks,

Joe, 
As we start thinking about scheduling a next meeting with S 
we were wondering if you 
could please let us know if there are any particular weeks that would not work for you or your 
client for a meeting in Florida (in particular, we don't want to interfere with anyone's summer 
vacation plans).

We will of course be in touch to talk about a next meeting in more detail, but in the first instance 
it would be helpful to get a sense of your schedules, for planning purposes.

This Court has personal jurisdiction over the parties pursuant to 5 V.I.C. § 4903. 
4. 
The Virgin Islands is an unincorporated territory of the United States. It consists 
of St. Thomas, St. Croix, St. John, and Water Island, and more than 40 surrounding islands and 
Cays, some of which are privately owned. Among these privately owned islands are Little St. 
James and Great St. James. 
5. 
Jeffrey E. Epstein ("Epstein") was a resident of the Virgin Islands and he 
maintained a residence on Little St. James, which he acquired in 1998 and in 2016 he also 
purchased Great St. James. 
6. 
Epstein registered as a sex offender in the Virgin Islands in 2010. He was a Tier I 
offender under Virgin Islands law based upon his Florida conviction of procuring a minor for 
prostitution. As a Tier I offender, Epstein was required to register annually with the Virgin Islands 
Department of Justice ("VIDOJ") and give advance notice of his travel to and from the Virgin 
Islands. Epstein was also subject to random address verification by VIDOJ. 
7. 
Epstein was found dead on August 10, 2019 while in custody in New York for sex 
crimes. 
8. 
Defendant Darren K. Indyke ("Defendant Indyke") is co-executor of the Estate of 
Jeffrey E. Epstein and Administrator of The 1953 Trust. 
9. 
Defendant Richard D. Kahn ("Defendant Kahn") is co-executor of The Estate of 
Jeffrey E. Epstein and Administrator of The 1953 Trust. 
10. 
Defendant, the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein ("Estate"), created upon Epstein's death, 
is domiciled in the Virgin Islands. On August 15, 2019, Defendants Indyke and Kahn filed a 
EFTA00018780

Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1111-1 Filed 09/01/20 Page 4 of 55 
GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI's First Amended Complaint 
Page 3 of 55 
Petition for Probate and Letters Testamentary which included Epstein's last will and testament 
with the Probate Division of the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands. 
11. 
The Petition reports the value of the real and personal property in The Estate located 
in the Virgin Islands at $577,672,654.00 dollars. 
12. 
According to the Petition, the assets in the Virgin Islands thus far includes: 
a. $56.5 million in cash; 
b. $127 million in fixed income and equity investments; 
c. $195 million in hedge fund and private equity investments; and 
d. $18.5 million in planes, boats, and automobiles. 
The Estate has not yet valued his fine arts, antiques, and other valuables. 
13. 
The Estate also includes shares of various corporate entities which hold residences 
and real property used by Epstein, namely: 
a. Brownstone in New York City valued at $56 million; 
b. Ranch in New Mexico valued at $72 million; 
c. Gated home in Palm Beach, Florida, valued at $12 million; 
d. Seven units in an apartment building in Paris, valued at $8 million; and 
e. Great St. James and Little St. James, collectively valued at $86 million. 
14. 
The Estate is responsible to pay damages for the acts committed by Epstein and the 
Epstein Enterprise described below. 
15. 
Defendant The 1953 Trust ("The Trust") was created by Epstein, who "amended 
and restated" its terms only two days before his suicide. That same day, Epstein revised his Last 
Will and Testament, transferring all of his "property, real and personal. wherever situated" to The 
Trust.

GVI's First Amended Complaint 
Page 4 of 55 
16. 
The Trust also contains Epstein's financial assets and is also responsible to pay 
damages for the acts committed by Epstein and the Epstein Enterprise described below. 
Defendants Indyke and Kahn, filed a Certificate of Trust in the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands 
for The Trust on August 26, 2019. 
17. 
Epstein maintained a deliberately complex web of Virgin Islands corporations, 
limited liability companies, foundations, and other entities, not all of which are yet known to the 
Government of the Virgin Islands, through which he carried out and concealed his criminal 
conduct. 
18. 
Epstein regularly created new entities in the territory and transferred properties and 
funds between them in order to preserve and shield Epstein's assets and to facilitate and conceal 
the unlawful acts described in this Complaint. 
19. 
These entities held properties, including Little St. James and Great St. James, at 
which Epstein trafficked and sexually abused women and underage girls. Epstein owned and 
arranged for private planes, helicopters, boat and automobiles to transport victims to, from, and 
within the Virgin Islands, and provided money to pay these young women and underage girls. 
20. 
Epstein sat at the hub of this web, serving as president, member, manager, or 
director of each of the entities and, upon information and belief, directing their activities. 
21. 
Defendant, Nautilus, Inc., is a corporation established and organized under the laws 
of the Virgin Islands. It was incorporated on November 22, 20 I I . 
22. 
According to records of the Virgin Islands Recorder of Deeds, Nautilus, Inc. owns 
Little St. James, a/k/a Parcel Number 109803010100, a parcel of 3.1 million square feet valued at 
$3.2 million, with buildings and improvements valued at $4 million.

Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1111-1 Filed 09/01/20 Page 6 of 55 
GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI's First Amended Complaint 
Page 5 of 55 
23. 
Epstein was president and director of Nautilus, Inc., which corporate filings 
describe as "holding property for personal use." Defendants Indyke and Kahn are the secretary and 
treasurer of Nautilus, Inc., respectively. The Estate values Epstein's holdings of Nautilus, Inc., 
which holds title to Little St. James at $63.9 million. 
24. 
A deed recorded with the Virgin Islands Recorder of Deeds on December 30, 2011 
reflects that the property was transferred from a Delaware entity, L.S.J., LLC, to Nautilus, Inc. for 
"TEN DOLLARS ($10.00) and other good and valuable consideration." The quitclaim deed lists 
Jeffrey Epstein as the sole member of L.S.J., LLC, which it acquired Little Saint James via a 
warranty deed dated April 27, 1998. 
25. 
As described below, Epstein engaged in a pattern and practice of trafficking and 
sexually abusing young women and female children on this private, secluded island of Little St. 
James where Epstein and his associates could avoid detection of their illegal activity from Virgin 
Islands and federal law enforcement and prevent these young women and underage girls from 
leaving freely and escaping the abuse. 
26. 
Thus, Nautilus, Inc. participated in carrying out, facilitating and concealing 
Epstein's crimes, hence Little St. James became an instrumentality of those crimes. 
27. 
Defendant, Great St. Jim, LLC, is a limited liability company established and 
organized under the laws of the Virgin Islands. Great St. Jim, LLC was organized on October 26, 
2015. Great St. Jim, LLC, according to records of the Virgin Islands Recorder of Deeds, owns at 
least three properties that make up Great St. James acquired on January 28, 2016: Parcel Number 
109801010100, consisting of 3.5 million square feet and valued at $17.5 million; Parcel Number 
109801010200, consisting of 450,000 square feet of land, valued at $2.8 million; and Parcel 
Number 109801010300, 1.2 million square feet of land, valued at $2.7 million. According to a 
EFTA00018783

Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1111-1 Filed 09/01/20 Page 7 of 55 
GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI's First Amended Complaint 
Page 6 of 55 
warranty deed filed with the Virgin Islands Recorder of Deeds, Epstein, through Great St. Jim, 
LLC, acquired the last two parcels for $5 million each. 
28. 
Epstein is listed as manager and a member of Great St. Jim, LLC and the nature of 
its business is described as "holding assets." 
29. 
Upon information and belief, Epstein purchased these Great St. James properties—
the island with closest proximity to Little St. James—to further shield his conduct on Little St. 
James from view, prevent his detection by law enforcement or the public, and allow him to 
continue and conceal his criminal enterprise. Epstein's significant investment in the purchase of 
Great St. James demonstrates his intent to expand his illegal operation in the Virgin Islands for 
years to come. Thus. Great St. Jim, LLC participated in carrying out, concealing, facilitating and 
continuing Epstein's crimes, and Great St. James became an instrumentality of those crimes. 
30. 
Defendant, Poplar, Inc., is a corporation established and organized under the laws 
of the Virgin Islands. Poplar, Inc. was incorporated on November 22, 2011. Epstein was president 
and director of Poplar, Inc., and its purpose was described in corporate filings as "holding property 
for personal use.- Defendants Indyke and Kahn are secretary and treasurer of Poplar, Inc., 
respectively. 
31. 
A certificate of incumbency provided to the Department of Planning and Natural 
Resources ("DPNR") also lists Epstein as president of Poplar, Inc. and expressly authorizes the 
incorporators to conduct "transactions related to permitting matters submitted on behalf of Great 
St. Jim, LLC." 
32. 
Poplar, Inc. is listed as the signatory for the 2017 Annual Report for Great St. Jim, 
LLC, and the signature appears to be Epstein's. The Petition for Probate and Letters Testamentary

GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI's First Amended Complaint 
Page 7 of 55 
filed by The Estate lists Poplar, Inc. as holding title to Great St. James. Thus, Poplar, Inc. 
participated in carrying out, concealing, facilitating and continuing Epstein's crimes. 
33. 
Defendant, Plan D, LLC is a limited liability company established and organized 
under the laws of the Virgin Islands. In its original Articles of Organization, filed October 19, 
2012, and Annual Report filings, Epstein's pilot, Larry Visoski. was listed as Plan D, LLC's sole 
manager/member. However, the July 31, 2019 Annual Report revealed Epstein as the principal 
behind Plan D, LLC. 
34. 
Upon information and belief, Plan D, LLC owns one or more of the airplanes and 
helicopters that Epstein used to transport young women and children to and from the Virgin Islands 
to carry out the criminal pattern of activity described below. Among the airplanes owned by Plan 
D, LLC is a Gulfstream with N-number N212JE. Flight logs and travel notices indicate that 
Epstein used this plane to traffic and transport and young women and underage girls to the Virgin 
Islands. 
35. 
Defendant, Hyperion Air, LLC is a limited liability company established and 
organized under the laws of the Virgin Islands on October 19, 2012. Jeffrey Epstein is a 
manager/member of Hyperion Air, LLC, along with his pilot, Larry Visoski. The purpose of 
Hyperion Air, LLC is listed in its Annual Report as -holding assets.' 
36. 
Hyperion Air, LLC is the registered owner of a Bell helicopter with N-number 
N331JE and a Keystone helicopter with N-number N722JE. Upon information and belief, Epstein 
used these helicopters to transport young women and underage girls between St. Thomas and Little 
St. James. 
37. 
Defendant Southern Trust Company, Inc. was originally incorporated in the Virgin 
Islands on November 18, 2011 as Financial Informatics, Inc., but changed its name to Southern

Trust Company in September 2012. Southern Trust Company is a tenant at American Yacht 
Harbor in Red Hook, St. Thomas, and Epstein is a "passive investor" in IGY-AYH, d/b/a American 
Yacht Harbor. By the end of 2013, according to its corporate filings, Southern Trust Company 
has assets of $198.5 million; four years later, its assets reached $391.3 million. From 2011 until 
at least 2018, Jeffrey Epstein was the President/Director of Southern Trust Company, and 
Defendants Kahn and Indyke were Treasurer/Director and Secretary/Director, respectively. 
Epstein was the sole owner of Southern Trust Company. 
38. 
John and Jane Does represent individuals and entities whose identities or 
involvement with Epstein are currently unknown. The Government of the Virgin Islands will 
amend the Complaint to add these individuals and entities when discovered. 
39. 
The Attorney General brings this action to seek all remedies available to the 
Government of the Virgin Islands in enforcing its laws and protecting the public interest and public 
safety. These claims are distinct from, and are not intended to supplant, the claims of victims who 
were unconscionably harmed by Jeffrey Epstein and his associates. 
FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 
A. The Conduct of the "Epstein Enterprise" in the Virgin Islands 
40. 
Epstein and his associates, including Defendants, identified and recruited female 
victims, including children, and transported them to the Virgin Islands where they were abused 
and injured. Epstein, through and in association with Defendants, trafficked, raped, sexually 
assaulted and held captive underage girls and young women at his properties in the Virgin Islands. 
41. 
Epstein created a network of companies and individuals who participated in and 
conspired with him in a pattern of criminal activity related to the sex trafficking, forced labor, 
sexual assault, child abuse, and sexual servitude of these young women and children. Epstein and

Page 9 of 55 
his associates trafficked underage girls to the Virgin Islands, held them captive, and sexually 
abused them, causing them grave physical, mental, and emotional injury. 
42. 
To accomplish his illegal ends, Epstein formed an association in fact with multiple 
Defendants and others (both companies and individuals) who were willing to participate in, 
facilitate, and conceal Epstein's criminal activity in exchange for Epstein's bestowal of financial 
and other benefits, including sexual services and forced labor from victims. 
43. 
This illicit association of Epstein, Defendants, and his associates constitute what is 
referred to herein as the "Epstein Enterprise." Epstein's associates in the Epstein Enterprise, 
including, but not limited to, those named as Defendants knowingly facilitated, participated in, and 
concealed Epstein's illegal conduct. 
44. 
Epstein used his wealth and power to create the Epstein Enterprise which engaged 
in a pattern of criminal activity in the Virgin Islands by repeatedly procuring and subjecting 
underage girls and young women to unlawful sexual conduct, sex trafficking, and forced labor. 
45. 
The Epstein Enterprise engaged in a pattern of criminal activity in the Virgin 
Islands (and elsewhere) with the criminal purpose and goal of placing a steady supply of vulnerable 
female children and young women into sexual servitude in service of Epstein's desires, and those 
of his associates. The Epstein Enterprise maintained and made available young women and 
underage girls for the purpose of engaging them in forced labor and sexual activities and used 
coercion and deception to procure, abuse, and harbor its victims. 
46. 
Flight logs and other sources establish that between 2001 and 2019 the Epstein 
Enterprise transported underage girls and young women to the Virgin Islands, who were then taken 
via helicopter or private vessel to Little St. James where they were then deceptively subjected to

Page 10 of 55 
sexual servitude, forced to engage in sexual acts and coerced into commercial sexual activity and 
forced labor. 
47. 
In furtherance of its criminal activities, the Epstein Enterprise used its aircraft to 
transport the young women and underage girls to the Virgin Islands for purposes of sexual abuse 
and exploitation. 
48. 
The Epstein Enterprise facilitated and participated in the sexual molestation and 
exploitation of numerous girls between the age of 12 and 17 years old. 
49. 
On the pretext of providing modeling opportunities, careers and contracts, 
associates of the Epstein Enterprise, funded by the Epstein Enterprise, lured and recruited young 
women and underage girls to travel to locations including the Virgin Islands where, upon 
information and belief, based on the pattern and practice of the Epstein Enterprise, they were 
sexually abused and exploited. 
50. 
Associates in the Epstein Enterprise recruited both victims and abusers into the 
Epstein Enterprise, participated in sexual acts of rape and abuse of minors and witnessed Epstein 
and others engage in sexual acts with children. 
51. 
As recent as 2018, air traffic controllers and other airport personnel reported seeing 
Epstein leave his plane with young girls some of whom appeared to be between the age of 11 and 
years. 
52. 
Upon information and belief, based on Epstein's pattern of trafficking and sexually 
abusing young girls, the Epstein Enterprise trafficked and abused these girls, and others, in the 
Virgin Islands through 2018. 
53. 
When sued in civil court for committing sex trafficking and sex crimes, Epstein 
never denied engaging in sexual acts with underage females and procuring underage females for

Page 11 of 55 
prostitution, but instead consistently invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-
incrimination. 
54. 
Upon information and belief, the Epstein Enterprise kept a computerized list of 
underage girls who were in or proximate to the Virgin Islands, and able to be transported to 
Epstein's residence at Little St. James in the Virgin Islands. 
55. 
The Epstein Enterprise engaged in a pattern of criminal conduct by trafficking 
children and young women and placing them in sexual servitude and forced labor in the Virgin 
Islands. The Epstein Enterprise repeatedly violated 14 V.I.C. §§ 133 to 138, which prohibit 
trafficking and sexual abuse. The Epstein Enterprise also repeatedly violated laws against child 
abuse and neglect, including 14 V.I.C. § 505, which defines the crime of child abuse as knowingly 
or recklessly causing "a child to suffer physical, mental, or emotional injury," or causing a child 
to be placed in a situation where such injury is foreseeable, and 14 V.I.C. § 506, which applies, as 
here, where the child suffers serious physical, mental, or emotional injury as a result of that abuse. 
The harm to Epstein's victims was both fully foreseeable and deeply damaging. 
56. 
The Epstein Enterprise knowingly recruited, transported, transferred, harbored, 
received, procured, obtained, isolated, maintained, and enticed young women and girls to engage 
in forced labor (such as providing massages) and, ultimately, sexual servitude at his little St. James 
residence. 
57. 
A 15 year old victim was forced into sexual acts with Epstein and others and then 
attempted to escape by swimming off the Little St. James island. Epstein and others organized a 
search party that located her and kept her captive by, among other things, confiscating her passport. 
58. 
Another victim, who was first engaged in provide massages to Epstein, was then 
forced to perform sexual acts at Little St. James in the Virgin Islands. When she attempted to

Page 12 of 55 
escape from the "private island," Epstein and a search party found her, returned her to his house. 
and suggested physical restraint or hann if she failed to cooperate. 
59. 
The Epstein Enterprise deceptively lured underage girls and women into its sex 
trafficking ring with money and promises of employment, career opportunities and school 
assistance. The Epstein Enterprise preyed on their financial and other vulnerabilities, and 
promised victims money, shelter, gifts, employment, tuition and other items of value. For 
example, participants in the Epstein Enterprise targeted young and underage females under the 
pretext that they would be paid substantially merely to provide massages to him and others. 
However, once drawn in, victims were then pressured and coerced to engage in sexual acts. 
60. 
The Epstein Enterprise forced underage victims to recruit others to perform services 
and engage in sexual acts—a trafficking pyramid scheme. 
61. 
The Epstein Enterprise paid girls for each "meeting." with additional money if they 
brought additional girls. Epstein reportedly required three meetings per day. 
62. 
The Epstein Enterprise used the term -work" as a code for sexual abuse, and, upon 
information and belief, reportedly kept computer records of the contact information for the victims. 
63. 
Consistent with his creation and use of a complex web of entities to carry out and 
conceal the criminal trafficking enterprise in the Virgin islands, the Epstein Enterprise sometimes 
paid young women and underage girls he exploited and trafficked through his charitable 
foundations. 
64. 
Once the girls and women were recruited, participants in the Epstein Enterprise 
enforced their sexual servitude of victims by coercion, including but not limited to, confiscating 
passports, controlling and extinguishing external communications, and threatening violence. They

GVI's First Amended Complaint 
Page 13 of 55 
also made fraudulent statements to family members of victims, claiming victims were being well 
cared for and supported financially in college and other educational opportunities. 
65. 
The Epstein Enterprise transported, held, sexually abused, trafficked, and 
concealed women and children at his property in the Virgin Islands dozens of times over nearly 
two decades. 
B. The "Epstein Enterprise" Abused Privileges of Residency to Carry out its 
Criminal Scheme 
66. 
The Epstein Enterprise in 1998 acquired Little St. James in the Virgin Islands as 
the perfect hideaway and haven for trafficking young women and underage girls for sexual 
servitude, child abuse and sexual assault. Little St. James is a secluded, private island, nearly two 
miles from St. Thomas with no other residents. It can be visited only by private boat or helicopter; 
no public or commercial transportation is available to carry persons on or off the island, and no 
bridge connects the island to St. Thomas. Epstein had easy access to Little St. James from the 
private airfield on St. Thomas, only 10 minutes away by his private helicopter, but the women and 
children he trafficked, abused, and held there were not able to leave without his permission and 
assistance, as it was too far and dangerous to swim to St. Thomas. 
67. 
In 2016, upon information and belief, using a straw purchaser to hide Epstein's 
identity, the Epstein Enterprise acquired Great St. James the nearest island to Little St. James. By 
then, Epstein was a convicted sex offender. Upon information and belief, the Epstein Enterprise 
purchased the island for more than $20 million because its participants wanted to ensure that the 
island did not become a base from which others could view their activities or visitors. By acquiring 
ownership and control of Great St. James to the exclusion of others, the Epstein Enterprise created 
EFTA00018791
--- PAGE 15 ---
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1111-1 Filed 09/01/20 Page 15 of 55 
GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI's First Amended Complaint 
Page 14 of 55 
additional barriers to prevent those held involuntarily on Little St. James from escaping or 
obtaining help from others. 
68. 
Great St. James and Little St. James are environmentally sensitive locations, with 
native coral and wildlife protected by federal and territorial law and enforcement authorities. The 
Department of Planning and Natural Resources ("DPNR") regulates and monitors construction in 
the Coastal Zone to protect, maintain and manage the precious natural resources of the Virgin 
Islands. Under its authority, DPNR repeatedly issued citations and assessed thousands of dollars 
of fines for violations of the Virgin Islands construction code and environmental protection laws 
on both Little St. James and Great St. James—significant penalties to the agency and to the average 
resident of the Virgin Islands. But because of Epstein's enormous wealth, these fines had little 
effect in curbing or stopping the Epstein Enterprise's unlawful conduct or conforming its activities 
to the law. 
69. 
As a result of illegal construction activity of the Epstein Enterprise, the Virgin 
Islands has incurred, and will incur, significant expenses to remove the illegal construction or 
remediate its effects on natural resources in and around Little St. James and Great St. James. The 
extent of the potential environmental damage is unknown at this time as the illegal construction 
has not been removed or remediated. 
70. 
The Epstein Enterprise continues to attempt to prevent or limit DPNR authorities 
from conducting random inspections on the Little St. James and Great St. James necessary to 
comply with Virgin Islands law. 
71. 
The Epstein Enterprise's violation of the construction and environmental laws was 
part of a pattern of behavior in flouting the laws of the Virgin Islands and holding itself above the 
law. 
Upon information and belief, as described above, the Epstein Enterprise undertook

GVI's First Amended Complaint 
Page 15 of 55 
construction at Great St. James after 2016 to continue the scheme to carry out and conceal his 
trafficking and sexual abuse of young women and children in the Virgin Islands. These actions 
are also indicative of the Epstein Enterprise's disregard for Virgin Islands' law. The Epstein 
Enterprise used the Virgin Islands' land, resources, people, and laws for its illicit purposes. Rather 
than participating lawfully in this community, the Epstein Enterprise took advantage of the 
secluded nature of the islands in furtherance of its crimes. 
72. 
As a result of its deplorable and unlawful conduct, the Epstein Enterprise has 
subjected the Virgin Islands to public portrayals as a hiding place for human trafficking and sex 
crimes. 
C. The "Epstein Enterprise" Fraudulently Concealed its Conduct 
73. 
The Epstein Enterprise fraudulently concealed its actions to prevent detection by 
the Government of the Virgin Islands. 
74. 
The secluded properties at Little St. James and Great St. James were repeatedly 
used by the Epstein Enterprise as the locations for unlawfully soliciting, transporting, transferring, 
harboring, receiving, providing, isolating, patronizing, maintaining, deceiving, coercing, and 
sexually abusing young women and children and concealing these crimes. 
75. 
The Epstein Enterprise was able to hide the trafficking ring from law enforcement, 
despite the fact that Epstein was a registered sex offender. Given the isolation of the Little St. 
James and Great St. James and the nature of the crimes and of the victims targeted by the Epstein 
Enterprise, the activities of the Epstein Enterprise were not readily detectable. Moreover, Epstein's 
great wealth and power likely made witnesses reluctant to report their observations to the local law 
enforcement. 
EFTA00018793

Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1111-1 Filed 09/01/20 Page 17 of 55

GVI's First Amended Complaint 
Page 16 of 55 
76. 
Upon information and belief, the Epstein Enterprise prevented its employees from 
cooperating with law enforcement. Employees and others were required to sign confidentiality 
agreements that prohibited them from speaking to or sharing information with law enforcement. If 
they were contacted by law enforcement they were to notify the Epstein Enterprise and be 
represented by Epstein's counsel. 
77. 
The employees were directed not to communicate or interact with guests visiting 
Little St. James and were also directed not to disclose to anyone events that occurred on the island. 
78. 
Monitoring a sex offender with his own private islands and the resources to fly 
victims in and out on private planes and helicopters presented unique challenges and allowed the 
Epstein Enterprise to limit scrutiny by the Government of the Virgin Islands. 
79. 
Sexual Offender Registration and Community Protection Act ("SORCPA") 14 
V.I.C. § 1721, et seq. requires sex offenders to register in their resident jurisdictions and to make 
periodic in-person appearances to verify and update their registration information. 
80. 
Epstein renewed his registration each year in the Virgin Islands. In addition, 
beyond this statutory requirement, the Virgin Islands periodically visited—or attempted to visit—
Little St. James to conduct additional address verifications. 
81. 
At his last verification in July 2018, Epstein refused to permit Virgin Islands 
Department of Justice Investigators, assisted by United States Marshals, to enter Little St. James 
beyond its dock, claiming that the dock was his "front door." Instead, Epstein arranged to be met 
at his office on St. Thomas. 
82. 
Epstein also misled the Government regarding his travel plans. On March 19, 2019, 
the Virgin Islands was notified that Epstein would be traveling to France for 10 days on the private 
plane owned by Plan D, LLC. His notification form did not disclose travel to any other countries. 
EFTA00018794
--- PAGE 18 ---
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1111-1 Filed 09/01/20 Page 18 of 55 
GVI v. Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
GVI's First Amended Complaint 
Page 17 of 55 
It was later found by law enforcement authorities that Epstein also travelled to Vienna and Monaco 
during that trip. 
83. 
Similarly, the Epstein Enterprise sought to prevent DPNR from conducting routine 
site visits to inspect unpermitted and potentially damaging construction activity on Great St. James. 
The Epstein Enterprise repeatedly objected to DPNR's inspections referring to them as "invasions-
of Epstein's constitutional right to privacy in his home, which he described defined as the entire 
island. These DPNR inspections are required for all construction and Virgin Islands residents are 
required to cooperate with the inspections to assure compliance with the law throughout the 
construction phases. 
84. 
These efforts represent Epstein Enterprise's intent to conceal its unlawful activity 
on Little St. James and Great St. James. 
85. 
The Epstein Enterprise also created numerous corporations and limited liability 
companies in the Virgin Islands to help conceal its unlawful activity. Most of these companies 
were created in 2011 and 2012, soon after Epstein registered as a sex offender in the Virgin Islands. 
86. 
Epstein's pilot, Larry Visoski is identified as member or co-member in companies 
that serviced and maintained the planes that the Epstein Enterprise used to traffick young women 
and children — Freedom Air Petroleum, LLC (registered November 28, 2011 to hold assets); and 
JEGE, LLC (registered October 19, 2012 to hold assets). 
87. 
Other Epstein entities include LSJ Employees, LLC (registered October 27, 2011 
to provide services); Southern Financial, LLC (registered February 25, 2013 to provide services) 
and LSJ Emergency, LLC (registered December 2, 2015 to provide services). 
88. 
Some of these companies held considerable assets: Financial Informatics, Inc. 
(incorporated November 18, 2011, also known as Southern Trust Company, Inc.) had assets of 
EFTA00018795
--- PAGE 19 ---
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1111-1 Filed 09/01/20 Page 19 of 55

GVI's First Amended Complaint 
Page 18 of 55 
approximately $391 million in 2015; and Financial Trust Company, Inc. (incorporated November 
6, 1998) had assets of $212 million when it publicly filed its last balance sheet in 2012. 
89. 
Though often absent in the original incorporation or registration documents or 
annual filings, Epstein ultimately appeared as president, director, manager, or sole member of each 
of these companies. Upon information and belief, the purpose of this complex array of corporate 
entities—some of which may still be discovered—was to allow Epstein to shelter his assets in 
order to fund, carry out, and conceal his identity and pattern of criminal conduct. 
90. 
The Estate continues to engage in a course of conduct aimed at concealing the 
criminal activities of the Epstein Enterprise. On November 24, 2019, Epstein's Estate filed an 
Expedited Motion for Establishment of a Voluntary Claims Resolution Program in the Superior 
Court of the Virgin Islands. (-Motion"). According to the Motion, the proposed program was to 
be designed to -"establish an independent and voluntary claims resolution program for purposes of 
resolving sexual abuse claims against Jeffrey E. Epstein." (Motion, at 1). 
91. 
The program proposed by the Estate, whose executors are trustees of The 1953 
Trust and officers in at least two Epstein entities, imposes confidentiality requirements and 
requires any claimant accepting an award under the program to sacrifice any other claims against 
"any person or entity arising from or related to Mr. Epstein's conduct." (Motion, at 5). It acts to 
conceal the criminal activities of the Epstein Enterprise and shield its participants from liability 
and accountability for the injury they caused to the victims. 
92. 
Two days before his death, Epstein amended The Trust and his Last Will and 
Testament. Upon information and belief, he did so, as part of a pattern and ongoing effort to 
conceal and shield his assets from potential recovery by claimants.

Page 19 of 55 
D. The "Epstein Enterprise" Violated Numerous Virgin Islands Laws 
93. 
The pattern of criminal activity engaged in by Epstein and other participants in the 
Epstein Enterprise violated 14 V.I.C. §§ 605 and 607 of the Criminally Influenced and Corrupt 
Organizations Act ("CICO"). 
94. 
The Epstein Enterprise also violated Title 14, Chapter 3A, The Virgin Islands 
Uniform Prevention of and Remedies for Human Trafficking Act relating to Trafficking of 
Persons; Title 14, Chapter 24, relating to Child Protection and Child Abuse and Neglect; Title 14, 
Chapter 81, relating to Prostitution and Related Offenses; Title IS, Chapter 85, relating to Rape 
and Sexual Assault and other related offenses, as well as other Virgin Islands laws. 
95. 
The Epstein Enterprise violated Virgin Islands laws by engaging in the human 
trafficking of underage girls and young women and commercial sex with young women and 
underage girls by force, fraud, enticement, or coercion, which serve as predicates to the Epstein 
Enterprise's violations of CICO. 
96. 
Certain participants who recruited women and underage girls to be trafficked and 
forced into sexual servitude themselves were sexually trafficked and abused by the Epstein 
Enterprise and may be afforded the protections of 14 V.I.C. § 145. 
97. 
Specifically, Plan D, LLC knowingly and intentionally facilitated the trafficking 
scheme by flying underage girls and young women into the Virgin Islands to be delivered into 
sexual servitude. Plan D LLC repeatedly made flights from the mainland to St. Thomas with 
Epstein and underage girls and young women for the purpose of engaging in sexual activity on 
Little St. James. On some occasions, they would transport Epstein and female children by

Page 20 of 55 
helicopter to Little St. James. On other occasions, Epstein and the young women and girls would 
be transported by boat. 
98. 
Great St. Jim, LLC and Nautilus, Inc. knowingly participated in the Epstein 
Enterprise and facilitated the trafficking and sexual servitude of young women and underage girls 
by providing the secluded properties at, from, or to which Epstein and his associates were able to 
transport, transfer, receive, maintain, isolate, harbor, provide, entice, deceive, coerce, and sexually 
abuse underage girls and young women. 
99. 
The Epstein Enterprise engaged in a continuing course of unlawful conduct. 
100. 
After Epstein's suicide, the Epstein Enterprise continued to exist as each of the 
participants continued to conspire to prevent detection of the breadth and scope of the Epstein 
Enterprise's criminal wrongdoing and to prevent accountability. These conspiratorial acts are 
ongoing. 
101. 
The conduct of the Epstein Enterprise offends the core purpose of the Virgin Islands 
Uniform Prevention of and Remedies for Human Trafficking Act, 14 V.I.C. §131 et seq, and 
violates CICO, enacted to "curtail criminal activity and lessen its economic and political power in 
the Territory of the Virgin Islands by establishing new penal prohibitions and providing to law 
enforcement and the victims of criminal activity new civil sanctions and remedies." 14 V.I.C. § 
601. 
102. 
The Epstein Enterprise is an illicit enterprise within the meaning of 14 V.I.C. §§ 
604 and 605. 
103. 
The Government is entitled to recover civil penalties, damages and other remedies 
and to extinguish and recoup from the Epstein Enterprise any and all financial and other benefits, 
and any personal and real property that was used during the course of, or intended for use in the

course of the conduct or criminal activity in violation of the laws of the Virgin Islands. The 
Government is entitled to obtain through divestiture, forfeiture, or other equitable relief all 
properties and instrumentalities used by the Epstein Enterprise in the criminal pattern of trafficking 
and sexual abuse in the Virgin Islands, including but not limited to Great St. James and Little St. 
James, and all other remedies and penalties permitted by law in the interest of justice. 
E. The Epstein Enterprise Used Corporate Entities to Defraud the Government and 
Fund its Criminal Activities 
104. 
In October 2012, the Southern Trust Company applied for economic benefits from 
the Economic Development Commission ("EDC"). The EDC is a subsidiary of the Virgin Islands 
Economic Development Authority ("EDA"), a semi-autonomous governmental instrumentality 
created and governed pursuant to 29 VIC § 1101. 
105. 
In sworn testimony at a public hearing on the tax incentive application conducted 
by the EDC on November 15, 2012, Epstein and his attorney, Ericka Kellerhals, described 
Southern Trust Company as providing "cutting edge consulting services" in the area of 
"biomedical and financial informatics.-
106. 
The EDC granted Southem Trust Company a 10-year package of economic 
incentives running from February 1, 2013 until January 31, 2023 that included a 90% exemption 
from income taxes and 100% exemptions from gross receipts, excise, and withholding taxes in the 
Virgin Islands. 
107. 
Between 2013 and 2019, Southern Trust Company employed 13 different 
individuals (not including Epstein). Of those 13 individuals, II served in administrative or support 
roles: six as personal, administrative, or executive assistants, receptionists, or as a driver/helper, 
one as an office manager, one as a clerk, and three in accounting or payroll functions (though only

Page 22 of 55 
one was licensed as a certified public accountant). There was one network administrator/IT 
manager, and a second who was added in 2019. 
108. 
In fact, several of those individuals seemed to perform other personal services for 
Jeffrey Epstein. Though he was reported by Southern Trust Company to be resident of the Virgin 
Islands, the network administrator/IT manager was issued a Florida driver's license, which listed 
an address in Miami. Further, he appears, in fact, to have served as Epstein's driver and picked up 
luggage and cargo from Epstein's private planes on his behalf 
109. 
Another executive assistant lived at 301 E. 66th Street, Apartment 11B, New York, 
New York. Epstein's address book lists units various units in this building as providing "Apt. for 
models" and she is publicly identified as a model. As noted above, the Epstein Enterprise used 
modeling opportunities and contracts as a pretext for recruiting underage girls and young women 
into its sex trafficking scheme. 
110. 
During several time periods, Southern Trust Company affirmed to EDC that it had 
no employees who were non-residents, even though it employed non-residents. 
III. 
Despite having only one full-time employee working on information technology 
during the bulk of the period, Southern Trust Company reportedly generated net income of $50.3 
million in 2013, $67.5 million in 2014, $52.8 million in 2015, and $4.8 million in 2016 and $17.1 
million in 2017, with aggregate income of $117.8 million in 2014, $170.6 million in 2015, $175.3 
million in 2016 and $192.4 million in 2017, or aggregate income for the period of $656 million. 
112. 
For the period between January I, 2013 and December 31, 2017, Southern Trust 
Company received tax exemptions totaling $73.6 million. 
113. 
As of December 31, 2017, Southern Trust Company, Inc. elected to file its income 
tax as an S-corporation, which elects to pass corporate income, losses, deductions and credits

through to its sole shareholder—Jeffrey Epstein—for tax purposes. For this time period, Epstein's 
income tax exemption was $71.3 million. 
114. 
Based upon these facts, it is clear that Southern Trust Company did not perform the 
"informatics" business represented to the EDC and could not have generated the business income 
attributable to that business. Instead, upon information and belief, Southern Trust Company 
existed to secure tax benefits for Epstein, to employ individuals associated with the Epstein 
Enterprise, and to provide a source of income to support his criminal activities and properties in 
the Virgin Islands.

Notice of Allegation of 
PUNITIVE DAMAGES 
307. 
The purpose of punitive damages in the common law is to punish the defendant 
for outrageous conduct that is reckless or intentional and to deter others from engaging in such 
conduct in the future.

that it shocks the conscience and offends a civilized society.

not sufficient.

At all times material herein, Epstein and the Epstein Enterprise engaged repeatedly 
in wrongful acts which were intentional and outrageous. The Government gives notice that it 
intends to pursue the possibility of punitive damages in any jury verdict. 
PRAYER FOR RELIEF

Team, truly excellent work on this. 
and I split up our review, so I took pages 3-116 of the motion 
sections), ands reviewing the rest. Two items to note — I tried to change subsequent cites to string cites where 
caught them, but I wasn't reviewing closely for that, so make sure the paras are reviewing for that. Second, as I discussed 
with-please take a look at the redactions in her section. I tried to conform them to the general principal that 
redactions should apply to the subpoena and the ex parte proceeding, and un-redactions should apply to the description 
of the article, her brief making general allegations, and our indictment. If that's not how you are envisioning the 
redactions, happy to discuss. 
Again, fantastic work. This is a very strong brief.

Our Counsel had a further question regarding the subpoena. In the subpoena, it states the Sacramento County 
Clerk/Recorder is to appear in person to testify, and produce the requested record, at the U.S. District Court for 
the Southern District of New York. Is this a requirement, or will presentation of the record to your office 
suffice? 
Your assistance in this matter is greatly appreciated.

ORDER 
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
The Court is currently in the process of planning logistics for trial in this matter and 
requires the parties' best and current estimate of length of trial. The Court plans to have the jury 
sit 5 days a week from 9am until 5pm. Given that jury selection will be complete by November 
and opening statements will occur on November 29, the Court requests that the parties 
provide their best estimate as to when the jury is likely to begin deliberations. This will allow 
the Court to assess the likelihood that trial may continue after the Christmas holiday and 
therefore whether the jury may be required to sit some days during the week between Christmas 
and New Year's Day. Accordingly, on or before October 12, 2021, the parties are ORDERED to 
confer and submit a joint letter with their best and current estimate as to when the jury is likely to 
begin deliberations. 
SO ORDERED.

YORK 
 STATE Office of 
Victim Services 
Claim Application and 
Instructions 
How to Apply for Compensation 
Who can apply for compensation? 
Innocent victims of crime, certain relatives, dependents, 
legal guardians and eligible Good Samaritans can apply 
to the Office of Victim Services (OVS) for compensation 
of out-of-pocket expenses not covered by insurance or 
other resources. 
What kind of expenses can I get compensated 
for? 
OVS offers compensation related to personal injury, 
death and loss of essential personal property. 
The specific expenses OVS may cover include: 
• 
Medical, pharmacy and counseling expenses 
• 
Loss of Essential Personal Property (up to $500, 
including $100 for cash) 
• 
Burial or Funeral Expenses (up to $6.000) 
• 
Lost Wages or Lost Support (up to $30.000) 
(Parents or guardians of hospitalized minor children 
may be eligible for this benefit) 
• 
Transportation (court/medical) 
• 
Occupational/Vocational Rehabilitation 
• 
Security Devices and DV Shelter Costs 
• 
Crime scene clean-up (up to $2.500) 
• 
Good Samaritan property losses (up to $5,000) 
• 
Moving expenses (up to $2,500) 
How do I ask for compensation? 
Send us your completed OVS application along with 
copies of: 
• 
Police reports 
• 
Medical bills 
• 
Correspondence with insurance companies 
or benefits plan saying if they will cover your loss 
• 
Insurance cards 
• 
Receipts for essential personal property 
• 
Death certificate and funeral contract 
• 
Victim's birth certificate 
• 
Proof of age (driver's license, birth certificate etc.) 
• 
Legal guardianship papers 
What if I don't have some of the papers OVS 
needs? 
Send your application in right away. You can send the 
other documents later. 
What if my property was lost, damaged or 
destroyed because of the crime? 
If you are under 18, 60 or over, disabled or were injured, 
you may apply for benefits to replace your essential 
personal property or cash that was not covered by any 
other resource. 
Essential means necessary for your health and welfare, 
like eyeglasses and clothes. 
What if I move? 
Send OVS a signed letter right away. Tell us your new 
address and phone number. Also let us know if your 
email address changes. 
Who can sign the claim? 
Generally, the victim must sign the claim. However, if the 
victim is under 18, or is physically or mentally incapable 
of signing, then the legal guardian (the person receiving 
the benefits) must fill out section 2 of the claim and sign 
the claim. 
If the victim died, the person asking for benefits must fill out 
section 2 of the claim and sign the claim. 
Is there another way to apply? 
Yes. Visit ovs.ny.gov to access the secure Victim Service 
Portal (VSP) and file an application on line. 
Do I have to fill out the attached HIPPA form? 
Yes. Fill out one HIPAA form for each service provider.

Court Ordered Restitution Information 
What is restitution? 
Restitution is compensation paid to a victim by the perpetrator of a criminal offense for the losses or injuries incurred as a 
result of the criminal offense. It must be ordered by the Court at the time of sentencing, and is considered part of the sentence. 
Restitution is NOT for payment of damages for future losses, mental anguish or "pain and suffering." 
When the District Attorney's (DA) office advises the Court that you have requested restitution or when the victim impact 
statement contained in the probation investigation report (pre-sentence, pre-plea or pre-disposition report) indicates that the 
victim seeks restitution, the Court must order restitution unless the interests of justice dictate otherwise. When the judge does 
not order restitution, the judge must clearly state his/her reasons on the record. 
What can I request as restitution? 
You can ask for any expense you incur as a result of the criminal offense — even for items the OVS may not be able to 
reimburse. Restitution may include, but is not limited to, reimbursement for medical bills, counseling expenses, loss of 
earnings, funeral expenses, insurance deductibles and the replacement of stolen or damaged property. 
Who is entitled to restitution? 
Anyone who has been the victim of a criminal offense and has suffered injuries, economic losses or damages can seek 
restitution. Many times, victims who deserve restitution do not request it. This can occur because victims are not aware that 
they are entitled to restitution, or do not know what steps to take to go about receiving the restitution they deserve. 
How do I ask for restitution? 
You should contact the DA's office and advise them of the extent of your injury, your out-of-pocket losses and the amount of 
damages you are requesting. 
It is your responsibility to give the police, DA and, upon request, the local probation department copies of the bills and 
other documents showing the extent of your injuries, your out-of-pocket losses and the amount of damages you want 
considered by the Court. Your claim for restitution will be included in any probation investigation report (pre-sentence, pre-plea 
or pre-disposition report). Be sure to: 
• 
Keep accurate records such as original receipts of any expenses you have as a direct result of the criminal offense. 
• 
Give copies of these receipts to the police. DA and local probation department. 
You need to clearly explain your need for restitution as soon as possible to the DA, the victim/witness advocate, and the 
probation department. Plea agreements can occur within days of the actual criminal offense. If this information is not provided 
before the plea agreement and sentencing, you may have to pursue the perpetrator in Civil Court. 
The DA is under an obligation to petition the Court to order restitution on your behalf. 
In all felony criminal cases, many misdemeanor criminal cases and all juvenile delinquency and persons in need of supervision 
(PINS) cases, a pre-sentence or predisposition investigation report is required. The local probation department will contact you 
about the issue of restitution as it pertains to your case. 
How is restitution determined? 
The amount of restitution is based on proof of your out-of-pocket losses incurred as a result of the criminal offense. The 
perpetrator has a right to object to the amount of restitution. The Court may hold a hearing on the issue of restitution where the 
Court may consider the perpetrator's ability to pay. The DA's office may contact you and ask you to testify at the restitution 
hearing. If you have a concern about appearing personally in Court, you should explore alternatives with the DA assigned to 
your case. 
If the OVS has paid your bills, the Court may order that restitution payments be made to the OVS for those paid items. It is 
important that you advise the DA's Office that you filed a claim with the OVS. 
If you filed a claim with the OVS, it is important that you advise the OVS if the Court orders the perpetrator to pay restitution.

He did, but 
is the one who spoke directly with him, so he can give you the most detail. (I took 
off 
this, so he doesn't respond with the substance and create needless 3500.) The most significant takeaway I recall

I just spoke with 
who got a call from an aspiring cooperator at MCC named IM=, 
reported that another MCC inmate known as "i"—
gave him information relating to Epstein. For 
several months, 
has been desperately trying to figure out how he can cooperate, often relying on second- and 
third-hand information that's not actionable unless another inmate also cooperates. We can also talk in person next 
week about the relative quality of his information. 
I leave it to you guys to follow up with 
as you see fit. I'm sure someone on this email can make 
available 
to you, if you want, once you get a sense of what he's about. I just don't want to unilaterally sit on this.

The Judge in Epstein's Case Should Not Turn the Dismissal Into a Drama for the Victims 
NY Law Journal 
By Bruce Green and Rebecca Roiphe 
8/26/19 
Last week, Judge Richard Berman ordered a hearing on the prosecutors' decision to dismiss the indictment against 
Jeffrey Epstein, who had been charged with multiple counts of sex trafficking and assault before he committed 
suicide in a Manhattan prison. The judge announced that he intends to allow victims to speak at the hearing, which 
is scheduled for August 27th. Berman stated: "The court believes that where, as here, a defendant has died before 
any judgment has been entered against him, the public may still have an informational interest in the process by 
which the prosecutor seeks dismissal of an indictment." 
This is an odd moment for transparency in a criminal case. Normally, if a prosecutor seeks to dismiss an 
indictment for such an obviously worthy reason, the court would simply grant the request The judge would not 
schedule a hearing and he definitely would not allow the victims to speak. And if he did hold a hearing, whatever 
informational interests the victims may have would be served by affording them a chance to attend the hearing, not 
by giving them a speaking role. 
The procedural rules governing federal criminal cases do not provide for posthumous trials. If the accused dies 
before trial, the federal court has no choice but to dismiss the indictment and end the case. Indeed, if an accused is 
tried and found guilty but dies while his appeal is pending, the federal court must set the conviction aside, as if it 
had never occurred. If a party to a civil lawsuit dies, his estate may step into his shoes. But in a criminal 
prosecution, the defendant's estate cannot be asked to answer for the defendant's alleged crimes. 
And so it is odd for the judge in this case to delay the inevitable dismissal, seemingly for dramatic effect. He has no 
choice but to dismiss the charges. At the hearing he scheduled, Epstein's lawyers will not oppose the prosecution's 
motion to dismiss the indictment. It is doubtful whether Epstein's former lawyers could oppose the prosecution's 
motion even if they thought there were grounds to do so. Epstein's defense lawyers no longer have authority to 
speak on his behalf: the lawyer-client relationship ended with his death. Nor would the victims have any plausible 
grounds to ask the judge to continue the proceedings. 
People are right to be both outraged and frustrated after Epstein's suicide. He was a true villain, as both sides of 
the political divide agree: Epstein was hated by the #MeToo movement and conservatives alike. His suicide denied 
the public an accounting for his egregious crimes. It left us all without a clear sense of how this rich and powerful 
EFTA00018867
--- PAGE 2 ---
man evaded justice the first time, when he served a meager sentence, much of it on home arrest, for similar 
charges. 
That said, now that he is dead, the criminal justice system is not the place for Epstein to be called to account The 
fact that the public has an interest in learning more about the process, as Berman suggested, does not mean that 
victims have the right to speak at a criminal proceeding scheduled for no obvious purpose but to give them a 
forum. One might think that there is no harm done in giving victims a chance to express themselves in the 
scheduled hearing, but that is wrong for two reasons. 
First, the criminal justice system is designed to determine whether defendants are guilty of alleged crimes beyond a 
reasonable doubt in a fair process in which both the prosecution and defendant participate. While many people 
assume that Epstein is guilty of the crimes alleged in the indictment and worse, our courts and constitution require 
that we presume him innocent until proven otherwise. Individuals charged with crimes must be allowed a chance to 
confront their accusers and put the government to its burden. Frustrating as it is that the government will never get 
the chance to present its case in a trial against Epstein, it is important to preserve the institutional structures 
nonetheless. Faith in the outcomes of run-of-the-mill cases require as much. 
It is often important to hear from victims—for example, at a trial where the accused contests his guilt or in a 
sentencing hearing after a defendant is found guilty. But conducting a hearing on an uncontested question solely to 
give victims a chance to tell their stories would be a rare if not unprecedented use of the courtroom—one that not 
only veers from the norm but also weakens the institutional commitments that are necessary to ensure that all 
individuals accused of a crime are afforded proper protection. 
Second, this seems more like a show than a real hearing. Judge Berman isn't really trying to obtain information 
about why the government is dismissing its case. We all know why. The defendant is no longer alive. So the hearing 
would necessarily be serving a different purpose: It might serve as a kind of theater at which the public works 
through its frustration and unresolved need for retribution. It might afford a collective catharsis for the victims 
who may be allowed to tell their stories in court and for other victims of sexual assault. These are both noble goals, 
but they are outside of the criminal justice system's mandate. 
We don't necessarily have to give up the goal of a public accounting. Not entirely anyway. Prosecutors in the 
Southern District of New York have indicated that they are not done with the investigation, leaving many to 
speculate that Epstein's co-conspirators will be charged. If so, the victims will get to tell their stories, at least 
partially. In civil lawsuits and forfeiture actions, they may also have an opportunity for their day in court. But we 
should not distort the criminal justice process by importing this perceived societal need into the criminal 
courthouse when there is no proceeding in which hearing from the victims serves a legitimate criminal justice 
purpose.

people familiar with the inquiry

Investigators scrutinizing video outside Epstein's cell find some footage unusable, according to people 
familiar with the inquiry 
Washington Post 
By Carol D. Leonnig and Matt Zapotosky 
8/26/19 
At least one camera in the hallway outside the cell where authorities say registered sex offender Jeffrey Epstein 
hanged himself earlier this month had footage that is unusable, although other, clearer footage was captured in 
the area, according to three people briefed on the evidence gathered earlier this month. 
It was not immediately clear why some video footage outside Epstein's cell is too flawed for investigators to use 
or what is visible in the usable footage. The incident is being investigated by the FBI and the Justice 
Department's inspector general's office, which are attempting to determine what happened and how to assess 
whether any policies were violated or crimes committed. 
The footage is considered critical to those inquiries, and the revelation of an unusable recording is yet another of 
the apparent failures inside the Metropolitan Correctional Center, the short-staffed Bureau of Prisons facility in 
downtown Manhattan that held Epstein. 
It's unclear whether the flaw in the taping affected a limited duration of the footage or whether it was a chronic 
problem in the beleaguered Manhattan facility. 
A Bureau of Prisons spokesman declined to comment, as did spokespeople for the FBI, the Justice Department 
and the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan. 
The people who spoke about the footage did so on the condition of anonymity, citing the ongoing probe. 
Epstein, a well-connected financier, had been charged in early July with sexually abusing dozens of young girls 
in the early 2000s and ordered held without bond. The arrest brought a sense of long-awaited justice to those 
who alleged Epstein abused them and who had earlier been dismayed by a 2008 plea deal he received to resolve 
similar allegations that was widely criticized as too lenient. 
That deal allowed Epstein to plead guilty to two state charges and spend just 13 months in jail, with work release 
privileges. The new charges could have resulted in a prison term of as much as 45 years. 
But on Aug. 10, the 66-year-old was found hanging in his cell. He was taken to a hospital, where he was later 
pronounced dead. His death was ruled a suicide. 
Prosecutors have since moved to drop the charges against Epstein — although they continue to investigate those 
who might have conspired with him. A federal judge has scheduled a hearing for Tuesday to consider the matter 
and has indicated that those who say Epstein victimized them will be allowed to speak in court. 
EFTA00018870
--- PAGE 2 ---
Meanwhile, there has been intense scrutiny of the federal facility where he was held, which did not follow its 
protocol in the handling of Epstein in several ways, officials have said. 
Epstein should have been checked on every 30 minutes in the jail's special housing unit, though it had been 
several hours since the last check when he was discovered as staff members delivered breakfast. Investigators are 
exploring whether logs were falsified to indicate checks had occurred when they had not, a person familiar with 
the matter said. 
The two officers on duty when Epstein apparently hanged himself were both working overtime — one forced, 
the other voluntarily, officials have said. One did not normally work as a corrections officer, though he had in the 
past and was allowed to do so, officials have said. 
Epstein also was supposed to have a roommate, following a July 23 incident in which he was found on the floor 
of his cell with marks on his neck. Authorities suspected he had attempted suicide; Epstein said he believed he 
had been attacked. 
He was placed on suicide watch for about a week after that — meaning he was monitored 24-7. He was placed 
back in the jail's special housing unit late in the month and, for a time, had a new roommate. 
But that person was transferred the day before Epstein's death, and a new roommate was not assigned — despite 
the fact that at least eight jail officials knew Epstein was not to be left alone in his cell. 
New York's chief medical examiner, Barbara Sampson, ruled Epstein's cause of death a suicide on Aug. 16. The 
ruling came five days after the medical examiner's office conducted an autopsy and classified the cause of death 
as pending while seeking additional information. 
The pathologist's autopsy found Epstein suffered fractures in his neck bones, according to two people familiar 
with the findings. Among the breaks in Epstein's neck was the hyoid bone, which in men is near the Adam's 
apple. Such breaks can occur in those who hang themselves, according to forensics experts and studies on the 
subject. But they are typical in victims of homicide by strangulation, experts told The Post. Experts also caution 
that such a break must be viewed in the context of the findings of a full autopsy to draw a conclusion about a 
cause of death. 
The hyoid bone becomes more brittle and is easier to break as people age. Epstein was 66. 
Law enforcement officials have said they believe Epstein killed himself. 
Lawyers for Epstein and his family had questioned Sampson's ruling of suicide and the thoroughness of the 
investigation into Epstein's death. 
"The defense team fully intends to conduct its own independent and complete investigation into the 
circumstances and cause of Mr. Epstein's death including if necessary legal action to view the pivotal videos —
if they exist as they should — of the area proximate to Mr. Epstein's cell during the time period leading to his 
death," the lawyers said in an Aug. 16 statement. "We are not satisfied with the conclusions of the medical 
examiner."

The beast has been slayed. 
I organized the files out of the jumble that they were brought to us in. A few things that will probably be helpful to know: 
1. 
There were some commissary receipts/finance documents pertaining to Epstein's activity inside of prison. I didn't 
know where to put this so I left it outside of the folders but still inside MCC Recs 
2. 
In the MCC Regs folder, I put a few things: 
a. 
One file had inventory and then at the end some documents pertaining to daily key counts. I wasn't sure 
if these were different so I created a separate file for the key counts just in case (while also keeping them 
in the inventory file) 
b. 
The MCC training 06-06-19 & information file was confusing to me. It was massive and I couldn't tell 
whether or not I needed to separate anything out.

Re: 
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
Attached please find the parties' joint request to charge and proposed verdict sheet. The 
Government is docketing a redacted version today and submitting the unredacted versions to the 
Court. The redline text in the documents reflect the objections of the defense. Further detail of 
the parties' objections are contained in comment bubbles. 
The Government has proposed the only redactions in the Request to Charge. These 
proposed redactions are consistent with the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in 
Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Although the Government's 
request to charge is a judicial document subject to the common law presumption of access, the 
proposed redactions are narrowly tailored to protect the privacy interests of a third party. 
The Government is also providing under seal Exhibit A, which pertains to a defense 
comment. The defense informs the Government that this exhibit is a document from another case 
EFTA00018881

that was not itself publicly docketed and therefore is submitting Exhibit A under seal.

Re: 
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) 
Dear Counsel: 
Pursuant to Rule 16(a)(1)(G) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Government 
hereby provides notice that it may call as an expert witness at trial Dr. Lisa Rocchio, a clinical 
instructor of psychiatry and human behavior at the Alpert Medical School of Brown University. 
The Government reserves the right to call additional expert witnesses and will promptly provide 
notice if the Government elects to do so. 
I. 
Disclosure by the Government 
Dr. Lisa Rocchio is the President-Elect of the Division of Trauma Psychology of the 
American Psychological Association ("APA"). Dr. Rocchio has practiced psychology since 
earning her Ph.D. in 1995, and she is currently a clinical instructor at the Alpert Medical School 
of Brown University, where she trains psychiatric residents in treating trauma survivors. Since 
she entered private practice in 1998, Dr. Rocchio has specialized in treating patients with trauma, 
including sexual trauma in childhood and adolescence. In the last twenty-three years, Dr. Rocchio 
has treated hundreds of victims of trauma, many of whom were minor victims of sexual abuse. 
Dr. Rocchio has also received specialized training in traumatic stress, sexual abuse, and clinical 
EFTA00018883
--- PAGE 2 ---
Page 2 
and forensic psychology. She has written, presented, and taught about the assessment and 
treatment of trauma, among other topics. Since 2014, Dr. Rocchio has been on the editorial review 
board of the APA journal Trauma Psychology: Theory, Research, Practice and Policy, and she is 
a member of the APA Ethics Committee. A copy of Dr. Rocchio's curriculum vitae is being 
produced to you today bearing Bates number 3502-006.' 
Dr. Rocchio is expected to testify, based on her relevant education, training, experience, 
and research to the following: Individuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by 
perpetrators of sexual abuse. Sexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of 
manipulation or coercion in the context of an established relationship that is developed over time, 
rather than through the use of forcible rape. Minor victims are often subject to a strategic pattern 
of behaviors, often called grooming, that can take a variety of forms and function to render the 
victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure the nature of the abuse, and to build trust and attachment 
with their abuser. The relationship of trust and attachment can prevent victims from being aware 
that what they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure. Minor victims therefore may 
not identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not recognize the 
consequences of that abuse until adulthood. Repeated exploitation and abuse can increase the 
likelihood of victimization later in life and can result in long-term traumatic and psychological 
consequences, especially when it occurs in the context of complex trauma. The presence of other 
individuals can facilitate the sexual abuse of minors. Dr. Rocchio is also expected to testify that 
nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for 
a variety of reasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted 
by a number of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma. Dr. Rocchio has not 
evaluated any specific victim in this case, and the Government does not presently intend to offer 
Dr. Rocchio's testimony regarding any specific victim. 
Dr. Rocchio's expected testimony relies on her education and training on psychological 
trauma, traumatic stress, interpersonal violence, and sexual abuse. It also relies on Dr. Rocchio's 
extensive clinical experience treating individuals who suffered sexual abuse and trauma in 
childhood and adolescence, as well as Dr. Rocchio's experience conducting forensic psychological 
evaluations of people who have experienced sexual abuse and trauma. The Government is 
producing notes from the Government's interviews with Dr. Rocchio today as well. 
II. 
Request for Reciprocal Discovery and Expert Notice 
In light of your request for the foregoing notice, the Government hereby requests reciprocal 
notice under Rule 16(b)(1)(C) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure regarding any expert 
witness that the defendant intends to rely upon, including a written summary of any testimony that 
the defendant intends to use under Rules 702, 703, or 705 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, as 
well as the witness's qualifications. 
' Dr. Rocchio has previously testified in state court and has been deposed in the course of federal 
and state litigation. As a courtesy, a list of that testimony is also being produced to you today 
bearing Bates number 3502-002. 
EFTA00018884
--- PAGE 3 ---
Page 3 
Additionally, the Government reiterates its August 5, 2020 request for reciprocal discovery 
under Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(b). Specifically, we request that you allow inspection and copying of: 
(1) any books, papers, documents, data, photographs, tangible objects, buildings or places, or 
copies or portions thereof, which are in the defendant's possession, custody or control, and which 
the defendant intends to introduce as evidence or otherwise rely on at trial; and (2) any results or 
reports of physical or mental examinations and of scientific tests or experiments made in 
connection with this case, or copies thereof, which are in the defendant's possession or control, 
and which the defendant intends to introduce as evidence or otherwise rely on at trial or which 
were prepared by a witness whom the defendant intends to call at trial. 
The Government also reiterates its August 5, 2020 request that the defendant disclose prior 
statements of witnesses she will call to testify, including expert witnesses. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 
26.2; United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225 (1975). The Government requests that such material 
be provided on the same basis upon which the Government agrees to supply the defendant with 
3500 material relating to Government witnesses.

United States Attorney

An attorney representing Ghislaine Maxwell, former associate of Jeffrey Epstein, once again pressed a New York 
federal court for her release, writing in a letter Wednesday that her prison conditions "rival scenes of Dr. 
Hannibal Lecter's incarceration as portrayed in the movie, 'Silence of the Lambs."

Dear Counsel: 
Today the Government is producing additional materials, including Jencks Act and 
Giglio material, regarding witnesses who may be called to testify at trial in the above-referenced 
case. Enclosed please find an index detailing the materials included in today's production. 
The Government is also producing today certain materials relating to individuals the 
Government does not currently intend to call as witnesses at trial in the above-referenced case. 
These materials do not contain a comprehensive set of Jencks Act and Giglio materials, as the 
Government does not expect to call these individuals to testify at trial. Instead, these materials 
contain, among other things, certain witness statements. Enclosed please find an index detailing 
these materials. This production should not be taken to indicate that the Government believes it 
has any obligation to provide all of these materials; rather, we make this production as a courtesy. 
Moreover, although the Government presently does not intend to call the individuals listed in the 
enclosed index, we reserve the right to do so and will notify you should the Government determine 
that it intends to call any of these individuals at trial. 
EFTA00018889

Please note that this letter, the enclosed indices, and the enclosed materials are 
governed by the July 31, 2020 Protective Order in this case. In particular, certain materials are 
designated as "confidential" under the Protective Order. The index is itself designated as 
"confidential," because it includes information regarding records designated as 
"confidential" under the Protective Order. The Department of Justice directed this office to 
cease the dissemination of materials marked with the word "confidential" in order to avoid 
potential confusion with markings reserved for classified documents. Accordingly, in order to 
note the appropriate designation of this production under the operative Protective Order in this 
case, the materials being produced today are marked with the following label: "SUBJECT TO 
PROTECTIVE ORDER PARAGRAPHS 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, and 17." This marking directly refers to 
the specific paragraphs of the Protective Order that govern today's production. 
Additionally, please note that many of the individuals referenced in this production are 
represented by counsel, as detailed in the enclosed indices. The Government reserves its right to 
amend and supplement these disclosures.

Our joint submission is due to the Court tomorrow outlining four categories of juror numbers. We're happy to take on 
the task of compiling data for our joint submission. To that end, could you please email us your list of strikes by noon 
tomorrow? Once we receive your list, we will compile that data into a letter outlining the four categories of juror 
numbers the Court has requested, and we'll send that back to you so that you can double check the accuracy of the 
chart. We estimate that process will take a fair amount of time, which is why we'll need your data by noon tomorrow if 
you'd like us to coordinate the process.

Hi all, 
Here's a version that incorporates the Loftus section. The plan is to have a draft in the chiefs' inbox when they wake up,

they talked to a sex trafficking or human trafficking AUSA (no name yet) about the issue. The reporter believes 
that it was not raised to senior leadership at the time and it went nowhere. 
CNN doesn't plan to run something immediately but knows that another reporter has similar information, 
so if they fed their competition will go with the story, they will, too. 
Any guidance or thoughts are welcome.

Subject: Epstein Probate 
Hi 
The U.S. Virgin Islands court has recently posted on its website the petition that was filed in the Epstein probate 
proceedings seeking establishment of a victim claims fund. The petition seeks "expedited approval" from the court to 
establish the fund, though no timeline is specified. (It is attached, if of interest.) If approved, estate assets would be 
used to pay for administering the fund, and deadlines would be set for victims to file their claims if they wish to 
participate. 
There was over a week's delay between when the petition was filed with the court and when the court posted the 
petition on its public page for "cases of interest" That page is not an official case docket, though it has at least select 
filings from the probate case (though I cannot tell if all filings are being posted). It would obviously be preferable if we 
had contemporaneous access to a complete docket, but we haven't been able to find a way to access an online 
complete docket. We're inclined to call the Virgin Islands court to ask whether there's a way to access a full electronic 
docket, but we wanted to check whether you have concerns before we do so (we doubt we would need to identify 
ourselves). Let us know your thoughts. 
Relatedly, what's the status of the 6(e) order? 
Thanks,

EXPEDITED MOTION FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF 
A VOLUNTARY CLAIMS RESOLUTION PROGRAM 
COME NOW the Co-Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein (the "Estate"), 
DARREN K. INDYKE and RICHARD D. KAHN, and move this Honorable Court for an 
expedited order to establish an independent and voluntary claims resolution program (the 
"Program") for purposes of resolving sexual abuse claims against Jeffrey E. Epstein, deceased, as 
more fully described infra. As contemplated by the Co-Executors, the Program would provide all 
eligible claimants an opportunity to receive compensation and voluntarily resolve their claims of 
sexual abuse against Mr. Epstein through a confidential, non-adversarial alternative to litigation. 
To be designed and implemented by independent, nationally recognized claims administration 
experts, with input from interested parties including claimants and their representatives, the 
Program would seek to timely resolve these claims through a process that is sensitive to the 
experiences and concerns of claimants and treats them with compassion, dignity and respect. 
I. 
BACKGROUND 
As widely reported in the news media, multiple individuals have asserted or expressed their 
intent to assert claims of sexual abuse by Mr. Epstein (collectively, the "Sexual Abuse Claims"). 
To date, twelve lawsuits involving Sexual Abuse Claims have been filed in the state and federal 
courts of the State of New York, where claimants assert some of the complained-of conduct 
occurred, and which recently amended its statute of limitations to permit such claims. These 
EFTA00018905
--- PAGE 2 ---
Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
Probate No. ST.19-PB-80 
Motion for Establishment of Compensation Program 
Page 2 
lawsuits name as defendants the Estate, the Co-Executors, and various entities owned or controlled 
by Mr. Epstein prior to his death, as well as purported agents and employees of Mr. Epstein or 
those entities. 
Pursuant to this Court's order, Notice to Creditors was duly first published on 
September 18, 2019. However, only one Sexual Abuse Claim has so far been filed in the Virgin 
Islands. As noted above, claimants have named the Estate and others in various lawsuits in 
jurisdictions outside the Virgin Islands and, based on media reports and statements by various 
counsel for plaintiffs, the Co-Executors anticipate that more Sexual Abuse Claims may be filed in 
various jurisdictions including New York, Florida, New Mexico and France. 
Purpose of the Motion 
• 
The Co-Executors believe that the interests of justice require the Estate to fairly 
address and timely resolve the Sexual Abuse Claims, no matter where filed, as 
a matter of national and international importance. As much of the value to 
claimants lies in the fair and timely resolution of their claims, the Co-Executors 
request that this Court grant the instant Motion expeditiously. 
• 
Guided by independent, nationally recognized claims administration experts, 
the Co-Executors have worked diligently to begin formulating a comprehensive 
process for determination and resolution of the Sexual Abuse Claims. If 
approved by the Court, the Program would provide, to the fullest extent 
possible, victims of sexual abuse access to a confidential claims resolution 
process that does not entail the rigors and publicity of litigation. To our 
knowledge, this Court is the first probate court that has been called upon to 
approve the establishment of a mass tort-type program for achieving the fair, 
EFTA00018906
--- PAGE 3 ---
Estate offebey Epstein 
Probate No. ST-19-PB-80 
Motion for Establishment of Compensation Program 
Page 3 
independent determination and resolutions of sexual abuse claims filed by 
multiple claimants against a decedent's estate. As a matter of public policy 
alone, the urgency of this matter cannot be overstated. 
Development of the Program for evaluation and resolution of the Sexual Abuse Claims, in 
a manner designed to evaluate those claims in a confidential manner and to streamline their 
determination by the country's most experienced claims administrators — individuals who have 
designed, implemented and administered extensive mass tort programs including the September 
I th Victim Compensation Fund, the Roman Catholic Church sex-abuse scandal, the BP 
Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, the Agent Orange toxic chemical matter, and 
others — would be in the best interests of claimants, the Estate, its creditors and its beneficiaries. 
Accordingly, in order to create a mechanism for the just and efficient resolution of the Sexual 
Abuse Claims that will attract the voluntary participation of claimants, the Co-Executors request 
the Court's authorization to use the Estate's funds to retain the services of the claims administration 
experts described below, so that they may properly proceed with preparation of the Program and 
design of an appropriate protocol to establish a fair, independent claims resolution process. 
II. 
PROPOSED EPSTEIN VICTIMS' COMPENSATION PROGRAM 
As contemplated by the Co-Executors, the proposed Epstein Victims' Compensation 
Program would ultimately function as follows: 
Participation in the Program by claimants would be entirely voluntary, and would not affect 
any rights a claimant has, unless and until the claimant accepts the Program's compensation 
determination and executes a release. All claimants would be afforded an opportunity to meet 
with the Program Administrator (described below) if they so desire, and will be treated with 
compassion, dignity and respect. The planned situs of the Program would be in New York, where 
EFTA00018907
--- PAGE 4 ---
Estate of JeJj5-ey Epstein 
Probate No. ST- I9-PB-80 
Motion for Establishment of Compensation Program 
Page 4 
the majority of the Sexual Abuse Claims thus far have been filed, in order to alleviate the burden 
of requiring claimants to travel to the Virgin Islands. Proceeding in that forum would also provide 
claimants and their counsel with easier access to the Program Administrator, who is highly 
qualified and experienced with this type of claims process, and is therefore likely to reduce the 
overall costs of Program administration. The Program would be open to claimants wherever they 
are located, and would use an electronic filing system to make the process available regardless of 
the claimant's location. 
A. 
PROPOSED MECHANICS AND ADMINISTRATION OF THE 
PROGRAM 
If this Court authorizes the Co-Executors to proceed with development of the proposed 
Program, a detailed Program protocol (the "Protocol") would be designed by the claims 
administration experts, with input from the Co-Executors and those with an interest in resolution 
of the Sexual Abuse Claims (including claimants and their representatives), and submitted to the 
Court for its approval. 
A ten-point summary of the contemplated Program follows: 
1. 
Participation in the Program would be entirely voluntary. 
2. 
The Program would be available to all claimants with sexual abuse claims 
against Mr. Epstein who satisfy certain eligibility criteria, as defined in the 
Protocol. 
3. 
While strict confidentiality will be required of the Program Administrator 
and the Estate, each claimant would be free to disclose any and all 
information concerning her participation in the Program, at claimant's sole 
discretion, including information concerning the mechanics of the Program 
and the resolution of her claim. 
4. 
Claimants who elect to file a claim with the Program would be invited to 
provide documentation identified in a claim form to be developed by the 
claims administration experts, and any additional corroborating or 
supporting information to help substantiate their claim. 
EFTA00018908
--- PAGE 5 ---
Estate of Jeffrey Epstein 
Probate No. ST- 9-PB-80 
Motion for Establishment of Compensation Program 
Page 5 
5. 
All claimants would be afforded a voluntary, confidential opportunity to 
meet with the Program Administrator to provide additional information that 
may bear upon evaluation of their claims. 
6. 
Claims would be processed promptly and efficiently. Claimants would be 
notified of any deficiency that prevents processing of their claim and 
provided an opportunity to cure that deficiency. 
7. 
Once a completed claim has been submitted, the Program Administrator 
would evaluate that claim based on all available information and would 
determine whether the claimant is eligible to receive compensation and the 
amount of compensation to be paid. This independent, individual 
determination will be based on factors and criteria identified in the Protocol. 
The Estate will have no authority to reject or modify the independent 
determination of the Program Administrator. 
8. 
Upon issuance of a compensation determination by the Program 
Administrator, the claimant would have complete freedom to accept or 
reject that determination. If the claimant elects to accept the determination, 
the claimant would execute a release waiving her right to litigate any claims 
she may have against any person or entity arising from or related to Mr. 
Epstein's conduct, as set forth in the Protocol. 
Upon the Program 
Administrator's receipt of the claimant's acceptance of the compensation 
determination and an executed release, the Program Administrator would 
approve payment. The approval of any claim by the Program Administrator 
will be deemed to have the effect of a claim "examined and approved" 
within the meaning of 15 V.I.C. § 394, and, as already indicated, the Co-
Executors would have no authority to reject or modify the Program 
Administrator's determination of any compensatory award made in 
accordance with the Protocol. 
9. 
The Program Administrator will submit status reports to the Court on a 
quarterly basis to provide updated information regarding the progress of the 
Program, including the number of claims received, the number of claims 
reviewed, the number of claims approved for payment, the aggregate value 
of determinations issued, the aggregate value of determinations accepted, 
and the aggregate value of determinations issued. 
10. 
Following conclusion of the Program, the Program Administrator would 
issue a Final Report to the Court and the Co-Executors summarizing the 
Program.

Motion for Establishment of Compensation Program 
Page 6 
B. 
PROPOSED CLAIMS PROCESS FOR PROGRAM PARTICIPATION 
With respect to the timing and notice of claims, the Program would, if approved by the 
Court, establish an effective commencement date and deadline for submission of all claims. A 
claim form would be developed by the Program Administrator and disseminated to all known 
claimants identified in a confidential database. Instructions for completing the form would be 
included along with the form. The Program would operate and maintain a website that provides 
general information about the Program, including the Protocol, Frequently Asked Questions, and 
information about filing deadlines. Contact information for the Program would also be available 
on the Program website. That website would also allow claimants, directly or through their 
representatives, to register a new claim and/or upload their claim form or supporting documents to 
facilitate submission and processing of individual claims. 
C. 
PROPOSED DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND ADMINISTRATION 
OF THE PROGRAM 
To establish the Program and design and implement the Protocol, the Co-Executors 
propose engaging the services of independent, nationally recognized experts in this field: 
Jordana H. Feldman, Kenneth R. Feinberg and Camille S. Biros, whose credentials are discussed 
in Section D below. The Protocol developed by these experts, with input from the Co-Executors 
and those with an interest in resolution of the Sexual Abuse Claims (including claimants and their 
representatives), would include eligibility criteria, the methodology for determining compensatory 
damages, proof requirements and claims procedures, and timing, as follows: 
• Eligibility. Identifying the criteria to determine whether a claimant is eligible to 
receive compensation under the Program. 
• 
Determination Methodology. Defining the factors and considerations to be used to 
determine the amount of compensation to be offered to any eligible claimant. 
EFTA00018910
--- PAGE 7 ---
Estate offeffrey Epstein 
Probate No. ST-19-PB-80 
Motion for Establishment of Compensation Program 
Page 7 
• 
Proof Requirements and Claims Procedures. Determining what types of 
supporting documentation or other evidence each individual may be required to 
submit to substantiate the claim, satisfy Protocol requirements, and allow the 
Program Administrator to review, process and evaluate the claim. 
• 
Timing. Expressly stating the timeframe of the Program, including an effective 
commencement date and deadline for submission of all claims. 
In addition to leading the design and implementation of the Program, Ms. Feldman would 
serve as the Program Administrator and would administer the Program and process all claims. The 
Program Administrator would have final decision-making authority relating to the administration, 
evaluation and valuation of claims. As noted above, the approval of any claim by the Program 
Administrator will be deemed to have the effect of a claim "examined and approved" within the 
meaning of 15 V.I.C. § 394. 
D. 
CREDENTIALS OF PROGRAM ADMINISTRATOR AND DESIGNERS 
The Program Administrator and Program Designers' qualifications for participation in the 
Program are set forth below.

Camille S. Biros (Program Designer) 
• 
Ms. Biros is a nationally recognized expert in the design, 
implementation and administration of public and private 
compensation programs. 
She currently serves as Director, 
Claims Administration, at the Law Offices of Kenneth R. 
Feinberg, P.C. 
• 
Ms. Biros and Mr. Feinberg have designed and implemented the 
New York Archdiocese Independent Reconciliation and 
Compensation Program for resolution of claims of sexual abuse 
of minors by members of the clergy, as well as similar 
compensation funds for the Dioceses of Brooklyn and Rockville 
Centre, New York and for Dioceses in the states of California, 
Colorado, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Ms. Biros has served 
as the primary Administrator of these various funds. 
• 
Ms. Biros has also served as Administrator of the DuPont 
Medical Monitoring Program, Deputy Administrator of the Gulf 
Coast Claims Facility after the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill, 
Deputy Administrator of the GM Ignition Switch Compensation 
Program and Deputy Special Master of the September 11th 
Victim Compensation Fund. 
III. 
REQUEST FOR RELIEF 
In their fiduciary capacity, the Co-Executors have engaged in discussions with relevant 
parties in interest regarding the independent, fair and timely resolution of the Sexual Abuse 
Claims. It is their understanding that many existing and potential claimants would prefer to 
participate in the Program, if fairly and expeditiously administered, rather than proceeding with 
litigation. 
Furthermore, although there would be significant expense in developing and 
administering the Program, the Co-Executors anticipate that the Program would substantially 
reduce the expenses to the Estate of litigating multiple lawsuits in numerous jurisdictions, and thus 
would ultimately reduce expenses to the benefit of all parties with an interest in the Estate,

including claimants and creditors.' The expedited nature of the planned Program would also 
ensure resolution and compensation to claimants in a far more timely manner than through 
litigation. Additionally, the Protocol associated with the Program would be designed to ensure the 
proportionate restitution of approved claims for all claimants, in a manner that would provide 
similar compensation to similarly situated claimants. The Co-Executors submit that such a 
Program is in the best interests of both the claimants and the Estate because, among other things, 
it avoids the potential of disproportionate and inconsistent awards and should help to reduce the 
time, expense and burden of handling claims through the courts, which could involve years of 
litigation and appeals and consume enormous resources, along with inflicting costs attendant to 
delay and uncertainty on all affected parties. 
Rule 1 of the Virgin Islands Probate and Fiduciary Rules states that, "[w]here no procedural 
provision is included herein, procedures set forth in the Virgin Islands Rules of Civil Procedure 
may be adapted by the court as appropriate." In this regard, Rule 90 of the Virgin Islands Rules 
of Civil Procedure evinces a clear intent in favor of the use of alternative dispute resolution to 
resolve civil disputes. Thus, it is respectfully submitted that the establishment here of a voluntary 
claims resolution program is within the Court's authority and would serve the interests of justice. 
Furthermore, development and implementation of the Program, and the claims process 
contemplated therein, is within the Court's sound discretion to establish a process by which the 
rights of claimants will be fairly and efficiently ascertained and administered. See 5 V.I.C. § 1264 
I. Such lawsuits have already begun to generate substantial costs and fees for both the Estate and claimants. The 
expenses of litigation are expected to ratchet up significantly in coming months, absent implementation of the 
Program as an alternative path for resolution of the Sexual Abuse Claims.

(allowing the court to declare tights, status and other legal relations of various classes of creditors 
or other interested parties of a trust or estate). 
At this juncture, the Co-Executors seek the Court's authorization to use Estate funds to 
retain the services of the proposed Program Administrator and Program Designers   Ms. 
Feldman, Mr. Feinberg and Ms. Biros — so that they may promptly proceed with preparation of 
the Program and design of the Protocol to establish a fair, independent claims resolution process. 
Once the Protocol is developed and finalized, the Co-Executors would submit it to the Court for 
approval and would seek an order to formally commence claims resolution proceedings under the 
Program. 
Finally, the Co-Executors seek the Court's approval to submit under seal the proposed 
engagement agreement of the Program Administrator and Program Designers, as it is proprietary 
to the extent it establishes a methodology and formula for their compensation. Given the very 
small group of people sufficiently qualified to design, implement and administer the proposed 
Program and contemplated Protocol, the terms under which they are engaged would be subject to 
intense scrutiny and may have the unintended effect of distracting from the Program. The Co-
Executors will of course disclose the fees for services rendered by the Program Administrator and 
Program Designers as they are accounted for by the Estate.

Re: Autopsy Report and File for Jeffrey Epstein 
Dear Ms. Butner: 
As you are aware, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New 
York ("USAO") and the Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI") are conducting an ongoing 
criminal investigation into the events related to Mr. Epstein's August 10, 2019 suicide at the 
Metropolitan Correctional Center ("MCC") (the "Criminal Investigation"). As you are also aware, 
between August 10, 2019, and August 16, 2019, at OCME's request and in order to assist OCME 
in determining the cause and manner of Mr. Epstein's death, the USAO and FBI gave OCME 
access to certain materials and information gathering during the Criminal Investigation. 
As discussed by phone, while the OCME autopsy is now complete, the Criminal 
Investigation remains ongoing. As such, and in order to avoid compromising the Criminal 
Investigation, we request that OCME withhold from disclosure to any third party any documents, 
evidence or information made available to OCME by the USAO or FBI—including documents, 
records, or materials from the MCC—or created by OCME or within the OCME case file that 
include, reflect, or contain information made available to OCME by the USAO or FBI. We also 
request that you withhold from any disclosure the names and identifying information of any federal 
law enforcement agents or employees who were interviewed by the OCME, along with the 
substance of any statements or interviews made by those agents or employees.

Re: 
United States v. Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, No. 19 Cr. 830 
Dear Counsel: 
We write in response to your discovery request letters, dated January 29, 2020. This letter 
and the content herein is designated as "Protected Materials" pursuant to the Protective Order 
entered in this matter. 
Thomas Request. The Government refers to its prior response to this request, as stated at 
the November 25, 2019 pretrial conference. 
Noel Requests No. 1-10, 12-13. We note, at the outset, that many of these requests are 
extremely broad and pertain to information that does not appear to be relevant to the case. To the 
extent material called for by these requests is within the Government's possession and subject to 
disclosure at this time, the Government has already disclosed such information to you, including 
by letter dated January 24, 2020. To the extent these requests call for information that is not 
currently in the Government's possession or which is not subject to disclosure, you identify no 
legal basis or authority for these requests, and we are not aware of any authority requiring us to 
obtain and/or disclose this information. 
Noel Request No. II. The name of the MCC technician referenced in the Government's 
previous letter is Hughwon Daniel. 
Noel Request No. 16. 
The Government has already produced the available video 
surveillance in its possession for July 23, 2019 for the Special Housing Unit. The Government 
attaches hereto two public filings in United States v. Tartaglione, 16 Cr. 832 (KMK), which 
reference these issues. 
06.20.2018 
EFTA00018948
--- PAGE 2 ---
Page 2 
Noel Requests No. 14-5, 17-23. These requests, in general terms, call for information about 
where particular evidence may be located within the discovery produced to date. As you note, you 
seek this information to "assist in expediting the ability of the defense to be ready for trial." 
Accordingly, with respect to Noel Requests No. 14-15, 17-23, at your request and solely as a 
courtesy to aid you in your review of discovery, the Government is providing the information that 
follows. The Government's response to your requests should not be used for any other purpose, 
nor should it be construed as a representation that only these files or portions of the surveillance 
video are potentially relevant to the Government's case or any potential defense, or as a 
representation that the identified portions are the only portions of surveillance video that would be 
responsive to your requests. The Government expressly reserves the right to identify and/or offer 
at trial additional material as probative of any of the issues identified in these requests. 
Noel Request No. 14. With respect to August 9, 2019, we direct your attention to the 
following 
video 
files: 
CH0080_20190809195956;

CH0080_20190810045959; and CH0080_20190810055959. 
Noel Request No. 15.  While the Government has not conducted a review of every time 
Jeffrey Epstein was captured on MCC surveillance during the more than 30 days he was housed 
there prior to his death and does not purport to provide such an exhaustive response, as a courtesy 
and to aid in your review of the discovery, we direct your attention to the following: on August 9, 
2019 Epstein was captured leaving his cell to make a phone call at approximately 18:53:54 -
18:54:46 (CH0080_20190809175956). Epstein was escorted back to his cell at approximately 
19:49:25 — 19:49:39 (CH0080_20190809185956). 
Noel Request No. 17. We direct your attention to files CH0080_20190809145956 and 
CH0080_20190809155956, during approximately 15:45:00 — 16:15:00 on August 9, 2019. 
Noel Request No. 18. We direct your attention to files CH0080_20190809205956 and 
CH0080_20190809215956, during approximately 19:45:00 — 20:15:00 on August 9, 2019.

approximately 22:29:00 — 22:34:00.

Noel Request No. 21. The Government does not presently believe this interaction was 
captured by surveillance video. 
Noel Request No. 22. The Government refers you to the forensic examination of the 
computers used by defendants Noel and Thomas during August 9 to 10, 2019, which were 
previously produced in discovery (SDNY_00000021 - SDNY_00000075). The Government also 
06.20.2018

That's an extremely expansive question. As one example, just from our research into his trafficking-related cases, we 
identified more than 30 attorneys who have represented him (in connection with at least 20 cases in federal court alone). 
Similarly, e.g., at just Deutsche Bank he had more than 60 separate accounts. From his AmEx records, he paid for nearly 
5,000 flights for individuals (many repeating, obviously, but still) in the past ten years. Etc. 
As a threshold reference, see the attached spreadsheet, particularly the "Witnesses and CCs" and "Epstein attys" tabs. On 
bank accounts, see the attached Deutsche Bank index spreadsheet with 2,000 rows of account (and relevant individuals) 
information. On associated individuals, a useful reference may be AmEx records, particularly the "AIRLINE" tab; that 
document is much too large to send via email, but I've put a copy in the following folder that Nick you have access to: 
In terms of people who would (or would potentially be able to) send money on his behalf, I think the likeliest individuals 
would be Darren Indyke, Jeffrey Schantz, and/or 
Obviously please let us know if you intend to contact or interview anyone in his world, and of course let us know if any 
additional information would be helpful.

Hi, 
Do you folks have a list of current known associates of Epstein? Anyone, including an attorney or some other agent, who 
he might communicate with, or who would send money on his behalf? Names, phone numbers, or bank accounts would 
be helpful. Thanksl

Epstein's will is attached. Lest there be any lingering doubt in your minds about what happened, Epstein 
apparently either created or meaningfully amended his will on...August 8, 2019.

thought that we should inform the government of the following so you can

Jhonny Contreras was recently returned to the SHU in the MCC. At the 
time of Mr. Epstein's death, it is my understanding that Mr. Contreras was 
housed in a cell on the same tier and across the hall from Mr. Epstein's 
cell. Mr. Contreras did not see Mr. Epstein hang himself, but he would be 
willing to speak to investigators, in the presence of counsel, about his 
observations.

apparently no AUSA assigned yet to the FBI side, but for example I would want to let FBI and 016 know that someone is 
claiming to be at MCC and calling Epstein's associates to have them pick up the body — they'll be more likely to have 
traction with BOP than we will.

Yeah of course. In some ways I actually hope this is a hoax because if not, it's completely insane. And I just called 
but he didn't pick up. 
Separately, and speaking of the FBI investigation, defense counsel also says that they're starting to get people calling them 
who claim to have information relevant to Epstein's death, and are wondering if there is an investigative point person to 
whom they can direct any such people?

I'll call you separately in a moment, but just in case email is faster, I just received a phone call from defense counsel that a 
person close to Mr. Epstein received a phone call from an individual named 
(phonetic) who claimed to be 
an investigator with the MCC and told the individual that Mr. Epstein's body was ready to be picked up at the hospital and 
that the individual could make arrangements for retrieval of the body. 
left his phone number as 
Can you please confirm whether that individual is in fact with BOP and/or MCC? Defense counsel is understandably 
concerned that they (and others with connections with Mr. Epstein) are starting to get hoax or otherwise inaccurate 
information through phone calls and emails. And we would again respectfully but urgently request that if there is 
information like this that needs to go to representatives for Mr. Epstein, that it come to us so we can pass it along to his 
counsel with confidence that it is true and accurate. 
(Separately, if it is accurate that BOP / MCC is prepared to release Mr. Epstein's body, his defense counsel is extremely 
concerned about whether that has been enough time for a full autopsy and any other investigative steps, and we would 
want to confirm that the FBI team addressing this matter has also been informed—but that's only if this is not a hoax, 
obviously.) 
Please advise as soon as possible, as the individual is waiting to know whether they should take steps to retrieve the body.

It is frankly unbelievable to me that BOP is issuing public press releases on this before telling us basic information so that we 
can relay it to his attorneys who can relay it to his family. When can we expect to get either some sort of statement we can 
pass along to counsel as accurate and reliable or have a call with someone? 
I understand from the Marshals that they have been unsuccessful in reaching anyone with authority at BOP, and given the 
BOP press release that was just put out I assume we need to speak with someone there. Please advise. 
Thank 
you.

Please see the attached emails regarding Suicide Watch and Psychological Observation. Suicide Watch and Psychological 
Observation occur in cells on the second floor. The only difference is that while on Suicide Watch inmates are not 
permitted to have clothes in their cell. 
Some questions I just asked Lt. Doctor this morning: 
1) Are there logs slips for the head counts done at 3:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m.? If so, can we get copies? 
She is getting us those forms. 
2) Who was Epstein's last cellmate? 
. He had court on 8/9/19 and was released from 500 Pearl St. According to 
the BOP webpage he was released from custody and his location now is unknown. 
was a regular SHU 
inmate, not special trainings according to his file. 
3) Was Epstein supposed to have a cellmate? 
According to Lt. Doctor, there was not a requirement for him to have a cellmate. 
4) Who assignments cellmates? 
Any officer can assign cellmates, as long as there are no "conflicts." The only person Epstein was not permitted to 
be cellmates with was "Tartaglione", who was his cellmate during his first suicide attempt.

I can do a call this afternoon. Any time between 2:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. is best. Alternatively, I am available tomorrow 
during the same time period. Let me know which time is more convenient for you and your team. If these times don't 
work, let me know and we will work out an alternate time. 
In the meantime, we have all the materials in a secure room on our second floor in West Palm Beach. There are the case 
files and also boxes of files that were gathered for the OPR inquiry. We have an inventory of our materials and also OPR 
has their own inventory of the materials. 
When OPR was here earlier, we had a scanner on that floor dedicated for their exclusive use. They were able to scan the 
documents that they wanted and have those documents sent directly to their own DOJ accounts. I was overseas at the 
time on detail, but I was told that this worked rather well. 
A copy of our inventory is attached. 
I look forward to assisting you in this matter.

Ghislaine Maxwell moves under the Fourth Amendment, Martindell v. Intl TeL & TeL 
Corp., 594 F.2d 291 (2d Cir. 1979), and the Fifth Amendment, to suppress all evidence the 
government obtained from a grand jury subpoena it issued to Boies Schiller Flexner LLP and to 
dismiss Counts Five and Six, which are the fruits of that unlawful subpoena. 
Factual Background 
The facts relevant to this Motion are described in Maxwell's Pretrial Motion No. 3 and 
the Reply in Support Thereof. 
Argument 
I. The Government's violation of the Fourth Amendment requires suppression. 
The government does not defend the overbreadth of its subpoena, or even respond to 
Maxwell's argument. Resp. at 82-95. The government also does not deny that the subpoena 
effected both a search and a seizure under the Fourth Amendment. Id. 
Instead, the government argues that (1) Maxwell has no standing to challenge the 
subpoena; (2) the government acted in good faith; and (3) the government inevitably would have 
come to possess the 90,000-sum pages of material it obtained from Boies Schiller. 
The facts and law belie the government's claims. 
A. Maxwell has standing. 
The government's standing argument boils down to this: Maxwell cannot challenge the 
search because the material was in the possession of a third party and Maxwell lacked a 
reasonable expectation of privacy. Resp. at 84-86. This argument fails. 
Abundant authority holds that when confidential material is in the possession of a third-
party, a defendant has standing to challenge a grand jury subpoena of that material. Matter of 
Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated Feb. 18, 1988, 685 F. Supp. 49, 51 (S.D.N.Y. 1988) 
(law firm could intervene and join motion to quash grand jury subpoena issued to private 
EFTA00019002
--- PAGE 7 ---
investigation firm). "The governing rule in these circumstances is that the possessor of the 
claimed privilege or right may intervene to assert it." Id. (quoting Appeal of Hughes, 633 F.2d 
282, 288 (3d Cir. 1980)). See also US Bank Nat. Ass'n v. PHL Variable Ins. Co., No. 12 CIV. 
6811 CM JCF, 2012 WL 5395249, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 5, 2012) ("A party [has] standing to 
challenge . . . a subpoena served on a non-party ... [when] the moving party assert[s] some right 
or privilege personal to it, such as an interest in proprietary, confidential information that would 
be disclosed or an interest in maintaining a privilege that would be breached by disclosure." 
(citing cases)). In turn, in determining whether there is standing, "[c]ourts should consider 
whether the information itself is private, confidential, privileged, or highly sensitive, and not the 
form the records take." Refco Grp. Ltd., LLC v. Cantor Fitzgerald, L.P., No. 13 CIV. 1654 RA 
HBP, 2014 WL 5420225, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 24, 2014). 
In United States v. Lavender, the Second Circuit held that while a defendant could not 
file an interlocutory appeal of the district court's denial of his motion to quash a third-party 
subpoena, he was "free to raise his Fourth Amendment claims via motions to suppress...." 583 
F.2d 630, 632 (2d Cir. 1978). Since Maxwell never had notice of the subpoena to Boies Schiller, 
she is doing here exactly what Lavender allows: filing a motion to suppress. 
To be sure, if the government were right—that the mere fact of a third-party's possession 
of property eliminates a defendant's standing—then Carpenter v. United States would have 
come out differently, since the defendant's historical cell-site location information was in the 
possession of MetroPCS and Sprint. 138 S. Ct. 2206, 2212 (2018). But the United States 
Supreme Court rejected application of the third-party doctrine for two reasons, as this Court 
should here. 
EFTA00019003
--- PAGE 8 ---
First, the Court recognized that 
[t]here is a world of difference between the limited types of personal information 
addressed in Smith and Miller and the exhaustive chronicle of location information 
casually collected by wireless carriers today. The Government thus is not asking 
for a straightforward application of the third-party doctrine, but instead a significant 
extension of it to a distinct category of information. 
Id. at 2219. Second, the Court concluded that in "in no meaningful sense" did Carpenter 
voluntarily "assume the risk" of "turning over a comprehensive dossier of his physical 
movements." Id. at 2220. 
The same logic applies here. There is "world of difference between the limited types of 
personal information addressed in Smith and Miller and the exhaustive" and personal details 
about Maxwell that are contained in Boies Schiller's 90,000 pages of confidential material. 
These details include, for example, information about Maxwell's sexual partners, sexual habits, 
finances, and much, much more. 
Moreover, "in no meaningful sense" did Maxwell voluntarily share this information with 
Boies Schiller. Giuffre sued Maxwell, not the other way around. And the defamation claim (the 
only claim Giuffre ever asserted against Maxwell, who did not file a counterclaim) had nothing 
to do with much of the confidential information Maxwell was forced, over objection, to provide. 
Maxwell's motion to dismiss the perjury counts for lack of materiality and her motion for 
severance, and the replies in support thereof, explain this in more detail. Maxwell Pre-Trial Mot. 
Nos. 4 8c 5. 
But the point is this: The defamation case should have been extremely narrow, but Boies 
Schiller transformed it into something much broader—a proxy prosecution of Epstein and 
Maxwell for allegedly trafficking and abusing Giuffre, which then compelled Maxwell, over 
objection, to answer irrelevant and highly prejudicial personal questions. None of it was 
voluntary. 
EFTA00019004
--- PAGE 9 ---
In addition to the inapplicability of the third-party doctrine, the government's response 
fails to account for two other, dispositive facts proving that Maxwell has a reasonable 
expectation of privacy. First, the Protective Order by its terms affords Maxwell a reasonable 
expectation of privacy. Mot. 3, Ex. Al 3 (defining "CONFIDENTIAL" information as that 
which "implicates common law and statutory privacy interests of . . . Ghislaine Maxwell" 
(emphasis added)). What would it say to civil litigants if they could not rely on a court's promise 
of confidentiality, at least absent notice and an opportunity to object to any breach of that 
promise (which, of course, Maxwell was denied here). See Mot. 3, Ex. A, ¶ 14 (precluding 
modification of the Protective Order absent "good cause shown following notice to all parties 
and an opportunity for them to be heard"). 
Second, Martindell affords Maxwell a reasonable expectation of privacy. Martindell, 594 
F.2d at 294. In Martindell, the Second Circuit held that "the proper procedure" to obtain 
confidential material under a Protective Order, "as the Government should know, was either to 
subpoena the deposition transcripts for use in a pending proceeding such as a grand jury 
investigation or trial, in which the issue could be raised by motion to quash or modify the 
subpoena, [Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)] or to seek permissive intervention in the private action 
pursuant to [Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b)], for the purpose of obtaining vacation or modification of the 
protective order." Id. (emphasis added)). By affording Maxwell a right to notice and an 
opportunity to be heard, Martindell makes clear that, having been denied those rights when the 
subpoena was first issued, Maxwell has standing to challenge the government's conduct now. 
Id.; see Lavender, 583 F.2d at 632. 
EFTA00019005
--- PAGE 10 ---
B. There is no good faith. 
The rebuttal to government's good faith claim is simple: There can be no good faith 
when the government willfully and intentionally misleads the court into authorizing its search. 
As the United States Supreme Court held in United States v. Leon, 
Suppression . . . remains an appropriate remedy if the magistrate or judge in issuing 
a warrant was misled by information in an affidavit that the affiant knew was false 
or would have known was false except for his reckless disregard of the truth. 
468 U.S. 897, 923 (1984). 
Here, as explained in Maxwell's due process motion to suppress and the reply in support 
thereof, the government misled Chief Judge McMahon to modify the Giuffre Protective Order 
and authorize the subpoena to Boies Schiller. The good faith doctrine does not apply when the 
government acts in objective bad faith. 
C. The government's inevitable discovery doctrine fails. 
There are several reasons the government's inevitable discovery argument fails. 
First, the inevitable discovery doctrine is an exception to the Fourth Amendment's 
exclusionary rule. United States v. Stokes, 733 F.3d 438, 442-43 (2d Cir. 2013) (reversing 
district court's denial of motion to suppress, which was based on "the inevitable discovery 
doctrine, an exception to the Fourth Amendment's exclusionary rule"). The doctrine has no 
applicability when a court exercises its inherent or supervisory authority to suppress evidence 
obtained through deliberate government misconduct. The exercise of that authority is meant to 
vindicate the dignity of the Court and to deter improper governmental conduct. See United States 
v. Cortina, 630 F.2d 1207, 1216 (7th Cir. 1980) ("The need for deterrence of illegal conduct is, 
in one sense, greater here than [elsewhere], for [the government's] offense was committed within 
the sanctity of the court itself."). 
EFTA00019006
--- PAGE 11 ---
Second, the government's inevitable discovery doctrine is far too speculative. The 
"typical application" of the inevitable discovery doctrine is when "the government seeks to 
invoke the doctrine on the basis of standardized, established procedures such as those requiring 
inventory searches." Stokes, 733 F.3d at 447. The government's "inevitability analysis in this 
case," however, "is predicated on an assessment of the actions that might have been taken by 
third parties," such as Judge Preska and the Miami Herald, who are "not acting at the behest of 
the police." Id. "Such an analysis is inherently speculative." Id. 
In fact, unlike every other civil case in the Southern District of New York against 
Maxwell or Epstein's estate, the government deliberately chose not to intervene in the on-going 
unsealing process in Giuffre v. Maxwell. In the only other active SDNY case against Epstein, 
Doe v. Indyke, No. 20-cv-484-JLIC, the government intervened and moved to stay discovery, 
saying that continued discovery could threaten its case against Maxwell. 
By contrast, the government opted not to intervene and stay the unsealing in Giuffre v. 
Maxwell. The reason is obvious. Legitimately concerned about the propriety of its conduct in 
misleading Chief Judge McMahon and issuing an unconstitutionally overbroad subpoena to 
Boies Schiller, the government hoped to hedge its bets by allowing the unsealing process to 
unfold so it could make the inevitable discovery argument it now makes. This Court should not 
condone such gamesmanship.' 
Third, the government's inevitable discovery argument is far too broad. Even the 
government admits that the vast majority of material it obtained from Boies Schiller is not on the 
Giuffre v. Maxwell docket and has not been unsealed by Judge Preska. Resp. at 94. In fact, the 
government's response appears to concede that its inevitable discovery argument is limited to 
' As the government recognizes, Judge Preska recognized this possibility, but deferred to this 
Court on the question since it is presiding over the criminal case. Resp. at 94 n.41. 
EFTA00019007
--- PAGE 12 ---
Maxwell's two deposition transcripts, Resp. at 94 & n.41. And as to Count 6 in particular 
(alleging perjury in the July 2016 deposition), the government concedes, as it must, that Judge 
Preska has refused to unseal all of the testimony charged in the indictment, except one question 
and one answer. Resp. at 94 n.41. The government offers no explanation for how it inevitably 
would have obtained all 90,000 pages of material from Boies Schiller when the two deposition 
transcripts don't even total 1,000 pages. 
Fourth, the government misunderstands the burden of proof. The government tries to 
fault Maxwell for seeking "suppression of all evidence [it] obtained pursuant to the subpoena," 
calling this a "windfall." Resp. at 95. But it's the government's burden to prove the applicability 
of the inevitable discovery exception. Stokes, 733 F.3d at 444 (inevitable discovery doctrine 
applies only "if the government can prove that the evidence would have been obtained inevitably 
without the constitutional violation") (rejecting government's inevitable discovery claim). The 
government must explain why Maxwell isn't entitled to this remedy, not the other way around. 
The government has fallen far, far short of meeting its burden, if only because it offers no 
argument—on the facts or the law—for how it might have inevitably discovered more than 
89,000 pages of material that hasn't been and won't be unsealed by Judge Preska. This Court 
should have no confidence, much less a "high level of confidence, that each of the contingencies 
necessary to the legal discovery of the contested evidence would be resolved in the government's 
favor." United States v. Heath, 455 F.3d 52, 55 (2d Cir. 2006) (articulating inevitable discovery 
standard). 
The inevitable discovery doctrine does not apply. 
II. The Government's violation of Martindell requires suppression. 
The government ignores the primary argument Maxwell made in her Motion: The 
government circumvented Martindell, and deprived Maxwell of due process, by securing a 
EFTA00019008
--- PAGE 13 ---
modification of the Protective Order in an ex parte hearing (chock full of misrepresentations) 
without first providing Maxwell notice and an opportunity to be heard. Mot. No. 11, at 11-15. 
The government offers no response to this fundamental point—Martindell demands notice and 
an opportunity to be heard; Maxwell received neither. Resp. at 76—81. 
Now, in an audacious request, the government argues this Court cannot evaluate the 
propriety of Chief Judge McMahon's analysis of Martindell, because Judge McMahon is a co-
equal judge who exercised her sound discretion. Resp. at 81 & n.37. Were the government's 
unsupported argument correct, though, it would mean that Maxwell will never have an 
opportunity to challenge the subpoena under Martindell, as that case and due process require. 
The government is not right. 
This Court does not owe deference to Judge McMahon's decision, for at least three 
reasons. First, Maxwell never was given the chance to oppose the government's request, so due 
process demands that she be given that chance now. Second, Chief Judge McMahon did not 
possess all the relevant facts because the government improperly concealed them from her. To 
the contrary, the government misled Judge McMahon about its contacts with Boies Schiller and 
the origins of its investigation, facts that were central to Judge McMahon's decision to modify 
the Protective Order and authorize the subpoena. Mot. No. 3 & Reply in Support Thereof. Third, 
this Court is not tasked with deciding whether the Protective Order should be modified or even 
questioning the correctness of Judge McMahon's modification. This Court is deciding a different 
question entirely—whether the government's violation of Martindell requires suppression. 
As to remedy, the government says that no case addresses whether suppression is proper 
for a Martindell violation. Fair enough. Resp. at 81. 
EFTA00019009
--- PAGE 14 ---
But that's doubtless because that law has been clear for forty-two years that the 
government can modify a civil Protective Order and then subpoena confidential material only 
after notice to the real party in interest and an opportunity to respond. Martindell, 594 F.2d at 
294 (Martindell decided in 1979). The proper procedure for modifying a civil Protective Order at 
the government's request, in other words, is the one that affords due process. U.S. CONST. 
amend. V. 
That no case has addressed the remedy for a Manindell violation is evidence only of (1) 
the government's prior compliance with Martindell (which should, of course, be expected), or 
(2) a criminal defendant having not raised the issue before. In this case, however, (1) the 
government violated Martindell, and (2) Maxwell seeks suppression as a sanction. 
Suppression is the proper remedy for at least two reasons. First, at its heart, Martindell is 
grounded in due process principles, and the government's conduct here violated Maxwell's right 
to due process. See U.S. CONST. amend. V. The essence of due process is notice and an 
opportunity to be heard. Martindell guaranteed Maxwell notice and an opportunity to be heard, 
594 F.2d at 294, as did the Protective Order, Mot. 3, Ex. A, 1 14. But Maxwell had no idea that 
the Giuffre Protective Order had been modified behind her back until she was indicted and the 
government disclosed the 90,000 pages of material it obtained from Boies Schiller.' The 
government's due process violation warrants suppression. E.g., Raheem v. Kelly, 257 F.3d 122, 
135 (2d Cir. 2001) (suppression for due process violation). 
Second, because the government violated Martindell not only by denying Maxwell notice 
and an opportunity to be heard, but also by affirmatively misleading Chief Judge McMahon, 
To this day, Judge Preska—who is presiding over the Giuffre action since Judge Sweet's 
passing and is addressing the Protective Order on a daily basis as the parties brief what material should be 
unsealed—apparently does not know the Protective Order was modified. 
EFTA00019010
--- PAGE 15 ---
suppression is proper under this Court's inherent and supervisory authority. Mot. No. 3 & Reply 
in Support Thereof. 
III. The Government's violation of the Fifth Amendment requires suppression. 
The government offers three responses to Maxwell's Fifth Amendment argument. None 
is persuasive. 
The government's first response is to deny any state action. Resp. at 99-100. But as even 
the government admits, a private party, like Boies Schiller, is deemed to be an agent of the state 
when the government "has provided such significant encouragement, either overt or covert, that 
the choice must in law be deemed to be that of the State." Resp. at 99 (quoting United States v. 
Stein, 541 F.3d 130, 146 (2d Cir. 2008)). Here, based on the record of the government's contacts 
with Boies Schiller in the months before and after Maxwell's depositions, there is at least a 
genuine question of fact as to the government's role in encouraging Boies Schiller. 
We know that the government contemplated a perjury prosecution of Maxwell, as seen in 
the government's newly-disclosed notes from the meeting. Reply ISO Mot. to Suppress, Ex. K, p 
5. And if the government is to be believed, there was only one meeting with Boies Schiller, two 
months before Maxwell's first deposition. If the government was contemplating a perjury 
prosecution before Maxwell even testified, it stands to reason that Boies Schiller and the 
government discussed at the February 29 meeting a plan to set a perjury trap for Maxwell. 
Indeed, the contemporaneous notes of the February 29 meeting show that Boies Schiller 
promised to send the government "depositions," Reply ISO Mot. to Suppress, Ex. J, p 8, and 
David Boies later complained about his frustration that the government had not yet charged 
EFTA00019011
--- PAGE 16 ---
Maxwell with perjury.; There are compelling reasons, therefore, to think the government and 
Boles Schiller collaborated and that Boies Schiller's conduct was in part at the government's 
behest. 
The record in the Giuffre case preceding the first deposition supports this conclusion as 
well. Based on Giuffre's claim of an ongoing investigation, Maxwell requested, prior to her 
deposition, that Giuffre disclose any alleged "on-going criminal investigation by law 
enforcement" or alternatively to stay the action pending completion of any such investigation. 
Ex. A. In part, Maxwell needed information concerning any such investigation to assess "the 
impact on any 5th Amendment privilege." Ex. A, p 3. The district court declined to afford Ms. 
Maxwell the requested relief. Ex. B. 
The day before Maxwell's April 2016 deposition, however, Judge Sweet ordered that 
"[a]ny materials that [Giuffre] has with respect to any criminal investigations will be turned over 
[by Giuffre] except for any statements made by [Giuffre] to law enforcement authority." Ex. B, p 
21. Maxwell had in fact served a discovery request on Boies Schiller for any such documents, yet 
Giuffre produced no such materials, and the deposition proceeded as scheduled the next day. 
In reliance on the Protective Order, which included no exception for any law enforcement 
need or subpoena and based on Giuffre's failure to disclose any "ongoing criminal 
investigation," Maxwell did not assert her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination 
during that deposition and testified truthfully. 
As explained in Maxwell's Pretrial Motion No. 3 and the Reply in Support Thereof, the 
government has now disclosed several documents "with respect to any criminal investigations" 
Stephen Rex Brown, Manhattan federal prosecutors declined to pursue Jeffrey Epstein and 
Ghislaine Maxwell case in 2016, New York Daily News (Oct. 13, 2020), 
https://www.nydailynews.corninew-yorlany-jeffrey-epstein-maxwell-case-20201013-
jinzh17zdrzdgrbbs7yc6binszu-stoty.html.
EFTA00019012
--- PAGE 17 ---
that Giuffre possessed in February and March 2016. Under Judge Sweet's pre-deposition order, 
Giuffre should have turned these documents over to Maxwell before the April 2016 deposition. 
Giuffre's failure to turn the documents over, despite Judge Sweet's order, is compelling evidence 
that Boies Schiller was acting as an agent of the state for Fifth Amendment purposes when 
deposing Maxwell. At the very least, the possibility cannot be dismissed out of hand, and an 
evidentiary hearing is appropriate. 
The government's second argument is that Maxwell waived her Fifth Amendment right. 
Resp. at 100. Not so. A waiver is valid only if it is knowingly made. United States v. Taylor, 745 
F.3d 15, 23 (2d Cir. 2014). And "'knowing' means with full awareness of the nature of the right 
being abandoned and the consequences of abandoning it." Id. 
Here, Maxwell did not knowingly waive her Fifth Amendment right. She declined to 
invoke it based on the protections afforded to her by the Protective Order, and on the 
understanding that the government was not actively investigating her. That understanding, as it 
turned out, was incorrect, but it was a misunderstanding deliberately encouraged by Boies 
Schiller with cooperation from the government. If Boies Schiller had disclosed that material 
Judge Sweet ordered them to disclose, Maxwell would have invoked her Fifth Amendment right 
and avoided the perjury trap the government and Boies Schiller set for her. 
It is for this reason that the government fails in its attempt to distinguish United States v. 
Oshatz, 700 F. Supp. 696 (S.D.N.Y. 1988). Resp. at 102. The government says that the logic of 
Oshatz does not apply because the defendant there had already been indicted whereas here, 
Maxwell was deposed "over two years before the Government opened its investigation." Resp. at 
100; id. at 102 (noting that the defendant in Oshatz "had already been indicted at the time of his 
deposition in a civil case for almost seven months"). Of course, this argument depends on the 
EFTA00019013
--- PAGE 18 ---
government's claim that its investigation of Maxwell did not start until 2018. But based on the 
discovery provided to Maxwell in response to her Pretrial Motion No. 3, we know the 
investigation actually began as early as 2016, when two months before Maxwell's first 
deposition, Boies Schiller met with the government and pressed an investigation for, among 
other things, per hay. This Court should adhere to Oshatz and, as the court there granted the 
motion to quash, here it should grant the motion to suppress. 
The government's final argument is a red herring. Resp. at 103. Maxwell's argument is 
not, and has never been, that a Protective Order cannot be modified. Maxwell agrees that, under 
Martindell, and after notice to the real party in interest and an opportunity to be heard, 
modification of a Protective Order is appropriate if the government can show "improvidence in 
the grant of a Rule 26(c) protective order or some extraordinary circumstance or compelling 
need." 594 F.2d at 296. Here, Maxwell was never given notice and an opportunity to be heard, 
and Chief Judge McMahon's finding of "extraordinary circumstances" was fatally tainted by the 
government's misrepresentations to her about the origins of its investigation. 
IV. The Court should hold an evidentiary hearing. 
Because there are genuine disputes of material fact, and for the reasons given in 
Maxwell's Pretrial Motion No. 3 and the Reply in Support Thereof, this Court should hold an 
evidentiary hearing. 
CONCLUSION 
For these reasons, as well as those given in the Motion, this Court should: (1) suppress all 
evidence the Government obtained from Boies Schiller and any other evidence derived 
therefrom; or (2) suppress the April and July 2016 depositions and all evidence derived 
therefrom; and (3) dismiss Counts Five and Six. Maxwell requests an evidentiary hearing on this 
Motion.

Hi

> 
Just want to put an issue on your radar. As you may recall, we paid a vendor to scan the SDFL Epstein file in October, and 
we are hopeful that it will be loaded into Relativity by the end of March (the delay was unfortunate, but we're hopeful 
PAE can make it happen soon). In order to meet pretrial disclosure deadlines, we need to review the file (which we 
understand to be 30k documents) to determine what has already been produced. We have recruited 4 paralegals and an 
intern in PC to help conduct this review, and have requested an additional 3-4 paralegals from Darcy to assist. The 
deadline is the end of April, so the team has about a month to complete the review. 
Happy to discuss any further if you have any questions. 
Thanks very much,

Thanks for your email. In accordance with Judge Nathan's order, we are writing to confer regarding Exhibit 11 and your 
cover letter dated March 9, 2021. Attached please find proposed redactions to Exhibit 11. We do not believe any 
redactions are necessary to your cover letter. 
We intend to the file the brief with the redactions as set forth in Judge Nathan's March 18, 2021 order, attached here for 
your convenience. We note that the redactions contained on pages 118 to 119 redact quotations from and references to 
a document that you filed under seal (Exhibit H). We understand that the quoted portions of that document are also 
under seal on the civil docket before Judge Preska. Given those facts, we wanted to double check with you to see 
whether you in fact want those redactions removed. We will defer to you on whether these should be redacted. 
Best,

Per Judge Nathan's order, we need to meet and confer today about proposed redactions to Exhibit 11 of your opposition

Please let us know what works for you.

I apologize about not getting back with you. I thought the other attorney that filed the response was going to do so. 
Regardless, the response included everything that Interlochen has. They only keep tuition payment information for 7 
years and nothing in their files reflects any payments by Epstein or Epstein entities.

Jeff and George, 
Thank you both very much for your assistance in response to our subpoenas seeking records from Interlochen. In 
reviewing the documents you produced in response to the attached subpoena, a follow-up question arose. Would 
you please confirm that your production included all records of any tuition payments that Epstein (or his entities) 
made for any students at Interlochen? 
Our team is also happy to discuss this inquiry over the phone if that would be useful. I am starting a trial tomorrow 
and will have limited availability this week, but my colleagues 
and 
(both cc'd) should be 
able to coordinate with you as needed.

The melding of our respective questionnaires has posed difficulties. 
For purposes of today's conferral, attached is your version of the questionnaire with slight edits in track change. 
Also attached is draft of our (far more robust) proposed questionnaire in Word (formatting to be corrected.) 
Our proposed questionnaire incorporates portions of your proposed voir dire, which would be redundant if 
covered by a written questionnaire. 
We are working on a more inclusive version of proposed voir dire questions for this afternoon's conferral.

Hi =I 
I hope you had a nice weekend, and thanks again for the call last week. I've attached the FedEx records for which we are 
ooking for a records custodian. According to a log, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida sent 
FedEx a subpoena in February 2008, and the FedEx point of contact was Tracy Ferrara. If we find any front matter, like an 
internal tracking number, we'll let you know. 
Thanks again for your assistance with this. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Hi 
Thank for your help with this inquiry. We're not sure whether this would have been the same account number during the 
time period we're looking at, but the account number we have 
More broadly, we are searching for any 
accounts or data associated with Ghislaine Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein.

We'd like to identify a records custodian who could testify, in the event that it would be necessary. 
We found the attached cover letter and certification from FedEx in 2008, in case they are helpful in finding the specific

We'd like someone to sign an affidavit for now, but we'd also like to identify someone who could testify at trial if need be. 
The trial is for Ghislaine Maxwell, scheduled to start in New York in November. 
I've attached a proposed declaration, though if FedEx has its own standard format, that will likely work too.

Good afternoon, 
p_.,usdoLgoi>
I am writing because my trial which was supposed to begin today has been moved to March 3rd. I asked the Court 
(EDNY) for March 4th off so I would be able to attend the status conference for Mr. Tartaglione and I explained briefly 
that there was a Curcio issue. That application was denied. 
So, I am wondering if you will be requesting more time to continue to review material and presumably get input from 
our firm. If so, then it may make sense to adjourn the conference. If you don't need more time, then I may make 
another request or ask Judge Karas to help. I don't think there is much else that will be done next week other than 
address the Curcio issue. 
Thank you.

Have we gotten anything yet from JPMC? Any indication of why they ended their relationship with him in 2013? 
As I'm sure you've seen, NYT has a piece up on the relationship which suggests executives at JPMC overruled compliance 
efforts to kick him out back in 2008-09 but the article doesn't suggest any financial misconduct or even red flags in his 
JPMC accounts, just the fact of his prior conviction.

Mr. Epstein's family has asked me to send to you and Adam Johnson at the MCC a request for the preservation of any 
and all documents, records, reports, videos, pictures, physical evidence, electronic communication data, tape recordings, 
logs, notes, papers, emails and any and all other forms of information that would be in the possession of the MCC, its 
Warden, their legal counsel, the USMS, the FBI, the Inspector General, the USAO for the SDNY or any other federal or 
relevant state or city agency that relate to Jeffrey Epstein's imprisonment/detention since July 6, 2019 and that relate 
particularly but not exclusively to the July 23, 2019 occurrence which was investigated as an attempted suicide by the 
MCC and the events relating to his death on August 10, 2019. The request encompasses but is not limited to any videos of 
the 9th floor area in the proximity of his cell during the evening of August 9 through the time Mr. Epstein was taken out of 
his cell for the last time on August 10, 2019, or videos of the cell itself during that time period, records of the identities of 
(i.e. MCC employees or independent contractors or anyone else) who were on duty from midnight through 8 AM on 
August 10, 2019 or otherwise had access to the 9th floor unit where Mr. Epstein was incarcerated during this time period, 
records of any observations of Mr. Epstein on August 9-10, 2019, any and all photographs of Mr. Epstein or his cell taken 
on August 10, 2019, any and all electronic or tape recordings or records of any internal communications within the MCC or 
any external communciations by MCC staff on August 9 and August 10, 2019, records of any mental health interviews or 
assessements of Mr. Epstein at anytime during his detention, records of any decision to put him on or take Mr Epstein off 
suicide watch, photos of his cell taken on or before August 9 or on or after August 10, 2019, memoranda of interviews with 
any prisoners who were in Mr. Epstein's SHU unit on the 9th floor on or about July 23 or on August 9-10, 2019 relating to 
Mr. Epstein, the same request for interview memoranda of any MCC employee or independent contractor or any other 
person in the MCC midnight-8 AM August 10, 2019, any and all medical and EMS and hospital records from July 23 
and/or August 10, 2019, and the future pathology and toxicology and medical examiner's reports. Additionally, we would 
request the preservation of any note or notes found in Mr. Epstein's cell on August 10, 2019, any ligature or other physical 
evidence related to his cause of death, any bedding, any medication or vitamins, any log showing who entered or were 
present in the MCC for the 12 hour period before 6:30 AM on August 10, 2019, as well as a list of inmates who were in Mr. 
Epstein's unit during the evening of August 9 and the morning of August 10, 2019. We would in addition to the 
preservation request ask for the production of all of the above. We would receive and retain in subject any information 
received in response to this request subject to the terms and conditions of our Protective Order. In short, the family requests 
a preservation and production of any and all records and documents relevant to his detention, treatment, and death. I will 
send an identical request to Mr Johnson (as well as to Mark Epstein's personal counsel

ago, attached is a press release just sent to us (and I believe also issued publicly) some minutes ago. It represents 
all the information we have from BOP so far, but of course if we are successful in our continuing efforts to get 
additional information we will pass it along immediately. 
Separately, we can tell you that the reports that an FBI investigation into the death has been initiated are 
accurate, and I fully expect that investigation to be extremely rigorous. 
As always please don't hesitate to reach out to us directly at any time if that would be useful. 
thank you, 
EFTA00019068

Subject: US v Epstein 
Date: Mon, 12 Aug 2019 12:54:55 +0000 
in 
first if the emails regarding Mr. Epstein's death and our preservation/production requests on behalf of his family 
should be sent to another prosecutor (Mike Miller had the name of 
but not the full name) please advise. We would 
ask you to confirm the request sent to you yesterday has been forwarded. We also request that DNA be lifted from the 
ligatures and/or bed stripping found in Mr Epstein's MCC cell on August 10, 2019. 
Separately, since the attorney client privilege survives death, we are still requesting a taint review in the event any review 
at all of his emails from the seizures at Teterboro on Aug 6 or from his NYC residence are to be undertaken. If you provide 
me with the name of the taint attorney when selected, I will provide a list of attorneys. 
Lastly, is it the Government's intention to move to dismiss the Indictment against Mr. Epstein and if so will that occur 
today? 
Thanks, Marty

Hi Audrey, 
Attorney 
The Maxwell team would like to send the attached "friendly subpoena" to 
attorney 
During our interviews in Florida, 
informed me that he has a copy of the settlement agreement between 
and 
Epstein, which resolved 
2009 civil suit against Epstein. MI is willing to provide us with a copy of the 
agreement, but he indicated that he believes he needs a subpoena before he can do so. His firm has already provided us 
with copies of all other court filings and deposition transcripts from the civil case voluntarily. The settlement agreement 
resolving the case is relevant to our ongoing investigation into Maxwell's participation in the abuse of 
and other 
underage girls. 
Thanks, 
EFTA00019080

government officials in an effort to overturn a $350 million import tax

Hi=, 
We just received the below and attached regarding discovery in the Maxwell case. Many of these questions relate to

and a 
— 
We write to raise a few issues concerning the discovery. Below is the list of items. Please let me know if you are free for a 
call to discuss. 
1. On our last call, we asked you if we could send our client a hard drive containing the discovery that we had created 
(without the highly confidential items). You had said you would check to see if you could facilitate this. We have 
not heard back from you. Are you able to send Ms. Maxwell the hard drive? 
2. The last two productions you sent to Ms. Maxwell on disks. As you know, she cannot read disks on her laptop and 
must use the prison computer. But the prison computer cannot read some of the files. We can include these files 
on our hard drive to send to Ms. Maxwell. Otherwise, you will need to produce them on a hard drive. Please 
advise which way you would like to proceed. 
3. A number of the emails in the discovery — over 109,000 — were produced without their attachments (see tab 1 of 
the attached Excel file). Instead, the attachments appear as slip-sheets (see example attached). Please provide the 
missing attachments, if they exist. 
4. A number of electronic documents — over 110,000 — that were extracted from one of Epstein's devices, as identified 
by a CART number, have metadata that indicates a "date created" or "date last modified" date in July 2020 or 
afterwards (see tab 2 of the attached Excel file). We request that you produce a metadata overlay with the original 
metadata for these files. 
5. A number of photographs — over 6500 — were produced in native format, but do not have a CART number and have 
"date created" and/or "date last modified" dates after July 2019 (see tab 3 of the attached Excel file). Please 
provide the CART number for these photographs or specify which device they came from. Also, we request that 
you produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files. 
6. A number of the audio/visual files — over 460 — have similar metadata issues (see tab 4 of the attached Excel file). 
These fall into the following buckets: 
a. SDNY GM SUPP: these have CART numbers, but were produced without metadata load files and have 
"date created" and "date last modified" dates in September-November 2020, after the date the device was 
seized. We request that you produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files. 
EFTA00019093
--- PAGE 3 ---
b. SDNY005 (October 20 2020 production): these are a few videos from the SDFL or PBPD investigations that 
were produced in native form without metadata load files. They have Sept-Oct 2020 dates. We request that 
you produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files. 
c. SDNY011 (November 9 2020 production): these were produced in native form with load files, but do not 
reference a CART number and have Sept 2020 dates. We request that you provide a CART number for these 
files or indicate their source. Also, we request that you produce a metadata overlay with the original 
metadata for these files. 
7. There is a gap between 11/18 and 12/18 production numbers (SDNY_GM_02742044 to 2742183). Was that 
intentional or are we missing those documents? 
Please let us know your responses as soon as possible.

v. 
DARREN K. INDYKE and RICHARD D.

ESTATE OF JEFFREY E. EPSTEIN, 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, an individual, 
Defendants. 
Case No. 
COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES 
DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL 
PlaintiffJane Doe ("Doe" or "Plaintiff") alleges as follows: 
INTRODUCTION 
1. 
This case arises out of years of sexual abuse and exploitation of a young girl by 
notorious pedophile and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein ("Epstein"). It all started in 1994 
when 13-year-old Jane Doe met Epstein and Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell ("Maxwell") at a 
summer camp in Michigan. Jane Doe was their first known victim and was subsequently abused 
by Epstein and Maxwell for years as a young girl, suffering unimaginable physical and 
psychological trauma and distress. Despite that, Jane Doe has persevered and survived to tell her 
story, to hold her perpetrators accountable and to seek justice for the atrocities committed against 
her. 
2. 
Throughout his life, Epstein systematically perpetrated acts of molestation. 
exploitation, assault and rape on hundreds of young girls. Epstein's system of abuse was 
facilitated in large part by his co-conspirator and accomplice, Maxwell, who helped supply him 
with a steady stream of young and vulnerable girls—many of whom were fatherless, like Jane 
Doe, and came from struggling families. 
COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES 
EFTA00019101
--- PAGE 2 ---
3. 
This system, which took years to develop, all started with them exploiting and 
abusing Jane Doe who they used as a guinea pig to refine their criminal enterprise and widen their 
network of additional sexual abuse victims. 
THE PARTIES 
4. 
Plaintiff Jane Doe is a citizen of the State of California. At all times relevant to this 
suit, Doe was a minor child living in Florida and New York and who was sexually abused while 
she was a minor by Defendants in New York. 
5. 
Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell is domiciled in the State of New York. 
6. 
Defendant Darren K. Indyke is sued in his capacity as an appointed executor of the 
Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein. 
7. 
Defendant Richard D. Kahn is sued in his capacity as an appointed executor of the 
Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein. 
JURISDICTION AND VENUE 
8. 
Plaintiff is domiciled in California. 
9. 
Jeffrey Epstein was a citizen of the United States domiciled in the U.S. Virgin 
Islands at the time of his death. As the legal representatives of the Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, 
Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn are deemed citizens of the U.S. Virgin Islands. The matter 
in controversy exceeds the sum of $75,000, and therefore jurisdiction in this Court is proper. 28 
U.S.C. § 1332(c)(2). 
10. 
Ghislaine Maxwell is domiciled in New York. 
I I. 
A substantial part of the events giving rise to these causes of action occurred in the 
Southern District of New York, thus venue in this district is proper. 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2). 
JURY DEMAND 
12. 
Plaintiff hereby demands a trial by jury on all of her claims in this action. 
FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 
Epstein and Maxwell's Abuse of Doe 
13. 
In the summer of 1994, Jane Doe met Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell at 
Interlochen Arts Camp in Michigan when she was only 13-years-old. Doe was there as a student 
COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES 
EFTA00019102
--- PAGE 3 ---
in the voice program. Doe was sitting alone on a bench between classes when Epstein and 
Maxwell approached her. Epstein bragged to her about being a patron of the arts and giving 
scholarships to talented young artists like Doe. Epstein and Maxwell probed her at length about 
her background, family situation and where she lived. As Doe got up to leave, Epstein requested 
her mother's phone number back in Florida. She was alarmed by his request, but also feared that 
she could not refuse the older man's request so she complied and provided him with the phone 
number. 
14. 
Several weeks later, once Doe had returned from Michigan to Florida, Epstein 
called Doe's home. Epstein first spoke with Doe's mother about how he mentors young kids and 
provides scholarships for the arts. He requested to speak to Doe and invited her and her mother to 
his mansion in Palm Beach. He sent a driver across town to pick them up. 
15. 
Over the course of the next several months, Epstein and Maxwell attempted to 
groom and mentor 13-year-old Jan Doe. Epstein gave himself the name of Doe's "godfather" 
while Maxwell acted like an older sister to her. They took her to movies, went shopping with her 
and lounged around Epstein's estate with her. Epstein and Maxwell then started to make sexual 
references when they were with her. For instance, Maxwell told Doe that having sex with ex-
boyfriends was easy because once you slept with them "they've been grandfathered in and you 
could go back and fuck them whenever you wanted." Epstein also started to slowly display his 
pedophilic ways when shopping with Doe and Maxwell. Instead of Doe picking out clothes she 
wanted to wear, Epstein insisted that she pick out and wear little children's cotton underwear. 
Also, after nearly every visit with Epstein and Maxwell, Epstein sent Doe home with two or three 
one-hundred-dollar bills to give her mother since "she's having a hard time and struggling as a 
widow." 
16. 
While these visits made Doe extremely uncomfortable, Epstein and Maxwell made 
her feel she could not refuse them. During this time, Epstein started to pay for voice lessons for 
Doe and insisted that Doe could not advance her career in any way without him. When Doe 
expressed hesitation about spending time with Epstein and Maxwell or acquiescing to their 
desires, Epstein and Maxwell would threaten Doe, and scold her for being "ungrateful". 
COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES 
EFTA00019103
--- PAGE 4 ---
17. 
During one of Doe's encounters with Epstein, he took her to Mar-a-Lago where he 
introduced her to its owner, Donald J. Trump. Introducing 14-year-old Doe to Donald J. Trump, 
Epstein elbowed Trump playfully asking him, referring to Doe, "This is a good one, right?" 
Trump smiled and nodded in agreement. They both chuckled and Doe felt uncomfortable, but, at 
the time, was too young to understand why. 
18. 
Towards the end of 1994, Epstein invited Doe into his pool house, where he 
grabbed her, put her on his lap and started masturbating. Epstein told her that was what to expect 
from photographers who were soon going to be take modeling pictures of her. However, when 
Doe was ultimately photographed by these professional photographers, they did no such thing.
19. 
Over the next few years, the sexual abuse escalated. On a regular basis, Epstein 
would digitally penetrate Doe, force Doe to perform sexual acts on him and apply vibrators on 
different parts of Doe's body. The abuse occurred at Epstein's home in Palm Beach, Florida, 
Epstein's townhouse on 9 East 71st Street in New York City, and Epstein's ranch in New Mexico. 
When travelling to these places, Doe often flew with Epstein and Maxwell in Epstein's private jet. 
20. 
In 1996, when Doe was 16-years-old, Epstein moved Doe to New York City. At 
first, Epstein put Doe up in his apartment on 65th Street and 2nd Avenue. After a few months. 
Epstein co-signed the lease for Doe and Doe's mother for an apartment. Additionally, Epstein paid 
her tuition at a private high school in Manhattan as well. 
21. 
Once Epstein had secured Doe in New York and made her and her family 
completely dependent on him financially (including, for the roof over their heads), Epstein's abuse 
of Doe continued to escalate. 
22. 
In 1997, while at Epstein's townhouse on 9 East 71st Street in the City of New 
York, Epstein asked 17-year-old Doe if she had a boyfriend. Doe replied that she did not. Epstein 
responded that when she did have a boyfriend she would want the sex to be "good" and that she 
should "get it over with already," meaning lose her virginity. Despite Doe's resistance, Epstein 
then pushed Doe down onto her stomach and raped her. From that point forward for several years 
in New York, Epstein raped Doe on multiple occasions.

During Doe's time in New York, Maxwell also regularly facilitated Epstein's abuse 
of Doe and was frequently present when it occurred. 
24. 
In 1999, Doe moved to Los Angeles to start a career. Upon moving to Los Angeles 
and being physically away from Epstein and Maxwell, Doe finally felt like she could escape 
Epstein's abuse and stopped returning his frequent calls where he would threaten and berate her for 
not appreciating him. 
25. 
Despite Doe's physical escape from Epstein and Maxwell, the years of abuse and 
exploitation perpetrated against her by them cause her immeasurable pain and suffering every day. 
Epstein's Death and Will 
26. 
In July 2019, Epstein was indicted by the Unites States Attorney's Office for the 
Southern District of New York. 
27. 
On August 10, 2019, Epstein was found dead in his jail cell at the Metropolitan 
Correctional Center, where he was being held pending trial. Upon information and belief, New, 
York City's medical examiner concluded Epstein died by suicide. 
28. 
On August 15, 2019, Epstein's last will and testament (the "Will") was filed in the 
Probate Division of the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands. 
29. 
The Will indicated that it was executed by Epstein on August 8, 2019 at the 
Metropolitan Correctional Center. The Will was accompanied by affidavits from Darren K. 
Indyke and Richard D. Kahn attesting to their "Oath of Willingness to Serve as Executor and 
Appointment of Local Counsel." Mr. Indyke and Mr. Kahn also filed a Petition for Probate and for 
Letters Testamentary in the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands. 
30. 
The Will's first article directs Epstein's executors "to pay from my estate all 
expenses of my last illness, my funeral and burial expenses, the administration expenses of my 
estate and all of my debts duly proven and allowed against my estate." The Will further directs 
that "after the payments and distributions provided in Article FIRST," Epstein "give[s] all of my 
property, real and personal, wherever situated...to the then acting Trustees of The 1953 Trust."

EFTA00019105
--- PAGE 6 ---
I 
31. 
On August 26, 2019, Defendant Darren K. Indyke filed a Certificate of Trust with 
the Superior Court for the Virgin Islands, confirming that he and Defendant Richard D. Kahn are 
the two Trustees of The 1953 Trust. 
32. 
On September 6, 2019, Magistrate Judge Carolyn P. Hermon-Percell of the 
Superior Court of the Virgin Islands ordered that Epstein's will be admitted to probate and 
authorized Mr. Indyke and Mr. Kahn to administer the estate. 
FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION 
(Sexual Assault) 
33. 
Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs and re-alleges them as 
if set forth fully herein. 
34. 
On numerous occasions over several years, Epstein, with Maxwell's assistance, 
made violent sexual demands on Plaintiff while placing his hands on her body in a position of 
dominance and control and while touching Plaintiff in violent and invasive ways. 
35. 
These demands, often made when young Plaintiff was alone with Epstein or with 
only Epstein and Maxwell, were intended to frighten Plaintiff into submitting to his sexual 
demands and placed Plaintiff in apprehension of harm. 
36. 
This conduct caused Plaintiff serious and persistent harm and contributed to 
injuries that Plaintiff continues to suffer. 
37. 
This cause of action is timely under the Child Victims Act, N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 214-g 
(McKinney 2019), because it arises out of conduct perpetrated against Plaintiff when she was 
under the age of 18 that constitutes a sexual offense as defined in Article One Hundred Thirty of 
the New York Penal Law ("Article 130"). See N.Y. P.L. § 130.52; N.Y. P.L. § 130.55. 
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION 
(Sexual Battery) 
38. 
Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs and re-alleges them as 
if set forth fully herein. 
39. 
On numerous occasions over several years, Epstein raped Doe. 
COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES 
EFTA00019106
--- PAGE 7 ---
40. 
On numerous occasions over several years, Epstein digitally penetrated Doe with 
his fingers, tongue and foreign objects. 
41. 
On numerous occasions over several years, Epstein made otherwise unwanted, 
unlawful, harmful, and offensive physical contact with Plaintiff's body. 
42. 
This conduct caused Plaintiff serious and persistent harm and contributed to 
injuries that Plaintiff continues to suffer. 
43. 
This cause of action is timely under the Child Victims Act, N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 214-g 
(McKinney 2019), because it arises out of conduct perpetrated against Plaintiff when she was 
under the age of 18 that constitutes a sexual offense as defined in Article One Hundred Thirty of 
the New York Penal Law ("Article 130"). See N.Y. P.L. § 130.52; N.Y. P.L. § 130.55. 
THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION 
(Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress) 
44. 
Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs and re-alleges them as 
if set forth fully herein. 
45. 
Epstein and Maxwell's campaign of sexual abuse against a teenaged Plaintiff was 
extreme and outrageous conduct that shocks the conscience. 
46. 
Epstein and Maxwell's serial sexual assaults, committed during the course of a 
methodical plan of recruitment, enticement, and attack, inflicted severe pain and anguish upon 
Plaintiff 
47. 
Epstein and Maxwell directed this conduct at Plaintiff and knew that it would cause 
severe and lasting emotional distress. Indeed, the conduct caused Plaintiff severe and lasting 
emotional distress and serious injuries to her mental health. 
48. 
This cause of action is timely under the Child Victims Act, N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 214-g 
(McKinney 2019), because it arises out of conduct perpetrated against Plaintiff when she was 
under the age of 18 that constitutes a sexual offense as defined in Article One Hundred Thirty of 
the New York Penal Law ("Article 130"). See N.Y. P.L. § 130.52; N.Y. P.L. § 130.55. 
FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION 
(Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress) 
COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES 
EFTA00019107
--- PAGE 8 ---
49. 
Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs and re-alleges them as 
if set forth fully herein. 
50. 
Epstein and Maxwell coaxed Plaintiff, then a teenaged girl, into Epstein's home for 
a period of several years. They worked hard to groom her. Once under their supervision and 
influence, Epstein and Maxwell proceeded methodically to sexually abuse Plaintiff. 
51. 
Epstein and Maxwell's conduct was extreme and outrageous, breached a duty owed 
directly to Plaintiff, endangered her physical safety, and caused severe and lasting emotional 
distress and serious injuries to Plaintiff's mental health. 
52. 
This cause of action is timely under the Child Victims Act, N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 214-g 
(McKinney 2019), because it arises out of conduct perpetrated against Plaintiff when she was 
under the age of 18 that constitutes a sexual offense as defined in Article One Hundred Thirty of 
the New York Penal Law ("Article 130"). See N.Y. P.L. § 130.52; N.Y. P.L. § 130.55. 
FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION 
(False Imprisonment) 
53. 
Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs and re-alleges them as 
if set forth fully herein. 
54. 
Defendants, in perpetrating the above-described non-consensual sexual assaults. 
did, by use of threat and/or physical force, willfully and intentionally confine, detain, imprison 
and/or restrain Plaintiff without lawful authority to do so, against her will, and without her 
consent. 
55. 
Plaintiff was aware of, and suffered the extreme effects of, the Defendants' 
unlawful confinement. 
56. 
As a consequence of Defendants' false imprisonment of Plaintiff, she sustained 
conscious pain and suffering, Plaintiff's health was impaired, Plaintiff suffered great mental 
distress, shock, fright and humiliation, and Plaintiff's reputation and character were injured. 
57. 
As a consequence of the conduct of Defendants, Plaintiff has incurred severe 
psychological trauma and damage, has suffered great humiliation, loss of esteem, mental anguish 
and suffering.

FYI, I am merely forwarding this email sent to me but directed to you. It isn't from a journalist, so far as I can tell, but 
rather from an Epstein/Andrew/others conspiracy theorist. The gentleman is asking you to make a public statement 
about Andrew and the investigation that addresses two points: 
• 
"The first would be to make an unequivocal statement to the press that the Prince IS now a target of your 
investigation due to his obfuscation and blatant stonewalling." 
• 
". . .this is the second thing I'd like to see you do, to ask your Attorney General why he has dismissed the idea of 
extradition out of hand?" 
From:

Subject: FOR THE ATTENTION OF GEOFFREY BERMAN 
FOR THE ATTENTION OF GEOFFREY BERMAN 
Dear 
May I offer my congratulations on the way in which your office has been handling the Prince Andrew 
Affair this past week? 
My thinking is that it must have been rather interesting, even for a grown man, to learn just how low 
and dirty and 
tricky the British can sink when push comes to shove? They make Roger Stone, he who still has a 
Richard Nixon 
tattoo on his back, look like an amateur don't they? 
Everyone it the UK has hugely welcomed the news that an MLA has been sought with the Home 
Office, and most 
seem to be confident that Priti Patel dare not interfere by denying your request. The consensus 
seems to be that 
she would instantly destroy not only her career but also her life by acting to prevent someone who is 
obviously 
a child-abuser and paedophile from facing justice when the entire English-speaking world has branded 
him a liar 
after the car-crash interview. 
However I am not so certain. Looking at the tactics they have employed this past week, of 
trying to blame you 
for all of Prince Andrew's ills when you are in the middle of trying to conduct a professional 
investigation into 
EFTA00019112
--- PAGE 2 ---
something as serious as child sex slavery; my thinking is that they are willing to use every 
dirty trick in the book 
to keep the pervert Prince out of the FBI's clutches. The UK Tory Party has always been 
an instrument designed 
primarily to maintain the status quo in this country, with priority always given to 
perpetuation of the monarchy. 
It would not be beyond the Eton/Westminster old boys to find some way of using Priti Patel 
without her even 
being aware of it. ( she's not all that bright ) Mark my words, this is what I expect will 
happen next; and I am 
a man who told the world that Jeffrey Epstein would never make it to trial barely 48 hours 
before his life was ended. 
So there are two things I am now hopeful you might do. The first would be to make an 
unequivocal statement to 
the press that the Prince IS now a target of your investigation due to his obfuscation and 
blatant stonewalling. 
Many are they on your side of the pond who have said, quite rightly, that an innocent man 
does not deflect or hide. 
And it is for this reason that everyone in Britain now feels that Prince Andrew really should 
be extradited. The reaction 
to the latest headline from the Sun newspaper has made this abundantly clear. Everyone 
is saying that if he were 
a Plumber or a Bus Driver he would be in handcuffs on a flight bound for New York right 
now. So don't you think it 
is high time, and this is the second thing I'd like to see you do, to ask your Attorney General 
why he has dismissed the idea of extradition out of hand? Is it not a slap in the face of 
Democracy to accord Prince Andrew special privileges 
simply because of his royal status? 
What does General William Barr want the world to think? That perhaps there may be 
people in high places in 
America who are guilty along with Prince Andrew? And this after Donald Trump himself 
was filmed next to their 
close mutual friend Jeffrey Epstein yelling "oh yeah, she looks hot!". 
Journalists all over the globe have been saying the whole world has been watching this 
affair unfold as if they had 
telescopic eyeballs. If the United States law system does not interrogate this wicked man 
under oath very soon the 
world will have to conclude that the American ruling class is controlled by Paedophiles in 
exactly the same way as the 
British ruling class. And that the kind of corruption we have seen in Hollywood which led to 
the death of children like Heather O'Rourke is endemic throughout the higher echelons of 
the entire Anglo/American establishment. 
EFTA00019113
--- PAGE 3 ---
Is this what you want the world to think? Does your Attorney General want the world to 
think that he must be 
a child abuser as well? 
You are now aware that the British Royal family are nothing but gangsters, every bit as 
willing as were the Chicago 
mob of the 1930's to silence anyone who becomes inconvenient. So please think about 
this very carefully... 
Supposing during the course of your investigation you uncover the inconvenient truth that 
both Donald Trump and 
your Attorney General ARE involved with the international paedophile network? and that 
your own country truly is 
being run by gangsters? 
What then? 
kind regards

Good morning-
As a result of my email to you on Sunday and your intervention with the MDC, Ms. Maxwell is permitted use of 
a mug for water and possession of commissary snacks in her isolation cell. 
However, the information provided to you regarding moisture and temperature conflicts with our information. I 
am told that moisture in her cell has degraded envelopes and paperwork and the temperature check was 
conducted outside her cell. 
I request that Ms. Maxwell be moved to an interior cell. This relocation would eliminate exposure to moisture 
and cold air seeping through exterior concrete walls. Further, it would assist in safeguarding Ms. Maxwell from 
impending cold temperatures and the detrimental effect of wind, rain and snow. 
Your continued assistance is needed and greatly appreciated.

As we've discussed, this isn't a plea offer, and we don't intend to issue a plea offer before notifying and consulting

All, 
'Kathleen E. Cassidy'

Following up on your questions about 18 U.S.C. § 1510, we wanted to let you know that it is our 
understanding that Section 1510 requires proof that the defendant knew the relevant law enforcement 
official was in fact a federal law enforcement official. See United States v. Escalera, 957 F.3d 122, 131 n.11 
(2d Cir. 2020) (citing United States v. Grande, 620 F.2d 1026,1036-37 (4th Cir. 1980) ("We read this legislative 
history to articulate a congressional intention that one may be found to have violated § 1510 only upon 
proof beyond a reasonable doubt, inter alia, that the person who was intimidated, threatened, or harmed 
was about to communicate information to another known by the accused to be a federal criminal 
investigator.")). By contrast, as we have discussed, Section 1512(b)(3) has no such requirement. If you have a 
different view of that issue or if there are any authorities you would like us to review, we'd be happy to look 
more closely at the issue. 
Please let us know if you have any questions, or if a call would be useful to discuss.

Hi all, 
Following up on our conversation last week, we wanted to send you two cases that we believe bear directly 
on the question you raised regarding Section 1512(b)(3). We're happy to discuss further when we speak 
tomorrow, but we wanted to send these to you in advance in case that's useful.

Thank you both very much for your assistance in response to our subpoenas seeking records from Interlochen. In 
reviewing the documents you produced in response to the attached subpoena, a follow-up question arose. Would you 
please confirm that your production included all records of any tuition payments that Epstein (or his entities) made for 
any students at Interlochen?

See below for the update from PAE. The good news is that they're getting this back to us on a rolling basis, and it looks 
like we'll have at least some of this stuff in time to produce it by 11/9. The bad news is it does not seem like we'll have all 
of it by that date. It does seem like we'll have greater clarity by early next week. 
I confess, I don't feel like I fully understand all of the steps in this process or why it takes as long as it does, but I'm happy 
to go back to. with additional questions if that would be helpful. I'm also happy to ask that he set up a call with us and

Some of the data is being sent to use today by FedEX. However, there is a ton of stuff still being processed. That stuff is 
still being imaged. Then it gets marked. Then copied to us. I have spoken to 
He thinks it is not possible to 
meet the November 9 date. He thinks the next step might be done on Tuesday, and then a better estimate of completion 
might be possible.

Good afternoon-
I write to request immediate assistance for Ghislaine Maxwell. 
There are many conditions and restrictions placed upon her at the MDC 
that are of great complaint, but of immediate concern are conditions within 
Ms. Maxwell's isolation cell. 
The combination of cold, moisture, and sewage stench have made confinement 
in her cell unhealthy, unbearable, and utterly unreasonable. 
Her request for an extra blanket has been denied. 
Her request for use of her day mug for water has been denied. 
(She's been told to cup her hands to drink water from the faucet.) 
Her request to keep a snack in her cell has been denied. 
The moisture accumulating in her cell risks her health and the security 
of her legal work. 
You have known me and my reputation among your colleagues and the court. 
Trust me when I way that in my 35 years of federal criminal practice, having represented 
individuals charged and convicted of terrorism and capital murder, housed in 
MCC's 10South and FCI Florence-ADMAX (facilities I have visited), I have never witnessed 
such inappropriate and outlandish treatment of a non-violent pretrial detainee held on risk of flight. 
The mistreatment of Ghislaine Maxwell reflects negatively on your Office, the Court, 
and the BOP. The Government as a whole can and needs to do better. 
For today, we seek the bare minimum - a change of cell to a location that is safe 
from the cold, moisture, and stench, and an extra blanket to keep her warm. 
The rest will be left for another day. 
Please assist. 
Thank you-

I apologize about not getting back with you. I thought the other attorney that filed the response was going to do so. 
Regardless, the response included everything that Interlochen has. They only keep tuition payment information for 7 
years and nothing in their files reflects any payments by Epstein or Epstein entities.

Thank you both very much for your assistance in response to our subpoenas seeking records from Interlochen. In 
reviewing the documents you produced in response to the attached subpoena, a follow-up question arose. Would you 
please confirm that your production included all records of any tuition payments that Epstein (or his entities) made for 
any students at Interlochen?

Greetings Janey, grossly corrupt SEC et al. 
The fraud on the SDNY courts perpetrated by the grossly corrupt SEC is staggering. Like me, Dan Kamensky 
never had a chance going up against the Mogilevich Bag Man Milken flunkie degenerate crew. 
Phat Leon Black: Apollo as I have previously stated: very high on the SEC/Dal "Do Not Investigate List". Milken's 
"right hand man at Drexel". Black, his family/Apollo controlled the ONLY Epstein SEC disclosed money

In 2002 the SEC brought a complaint against ESWW: Fraud. With money laundering flags too numerous to 
count. But, in typical SEC Cover up mode: no AML complaint.

So, Black, his family, and Apollo KNEW ESWW was an OTCM money laundering shell when it "invested" along

The SEC kept ESWW up and running for 13 years AFTER it filed its complaint while Black/his

even revoked. Rather: voluntarily withdrawn.

One of these things is not like the others: Dan Kamensky is NOT on the Milken et al SECIDoJ "Do not

degenerates. ESWW: a money laundering OTCM shell. Leon Black? His family? Apollo? Epstein? Yes SDNY 
and grossly corrupt SEC: Junk is junk. Milken is the nexus of ALL of it. Obviously, Pm not in the inner circle 
either Mr Kamensky. I blew the whistle on a massive, SEC facilitated fraud on the public that is very much 
ongoing. The SEC has KNOWINGLY used the SDNY courts to perpetuate this massive fraud prosecuting some 
while corruptly and criminally obstructing prosecution of KNOWN criminals. AND screwing those who blow 
the whistle and dare challenge: Dan Kamensky and Chris Dilorio.

Good afternoon, 
After calling 1-800-648-8411 for general conference information, the young lady there suggested that I email you as the 
conference coordinator. 
I am a special agent with the Miami Division/West Palm Beach Office of the FBI. The phone number below, 561-833-7517, 
is the main office number in West Palm Beach, and Miami's office number is 305-944-9101. (The switchboard operators at 
either number can verify my identity.) 
I am trying to locate the financial and /or investment conference that two individuals attended in New Orleans between 
approximately 1998-2000 and what hotels your conference would have used during those time periods. I believe your 
conference may be the one I am looking for. 
I am trying to determine if the following two individuals attended the New Orleans Investment Conference between 1998-
2000; 
1. Jeffrey Epstein 
2. 
Any information or assistance you could provide would be greatly appreciated. 
Thank you,

Ms. Thonn, 
Thank you for the information below on the hotels. I realize records from 12 or 13 years ago may be difficult to track 
down. I appreciate you checking into to this. 
I have two other quick questions, if you wouldn't mind. 
Is your conference always held the same time of year? I see this year it's in late October. Also, what hotels did the 
conference use in 2001? 
Thank you again and have a good weekend,

Good morning, Ms. MM. For the moment I can verify for you which hotel was utilized for the Conferences 
listed below. Regarding these two individuals participating, however, I'll have to get back with you. We've 
transitioned through several computer databases since then and all of our paper records were destroyed at our 
storage facility several years ago. I'll do some checking and get back with you hopefully early next week.

Adele, 
Thanks again for looking through your records and helping with this. 
After finding information about your conference online, it seemed to be the type of event/conference that I was looking 
for, but I knew that it could be a shot in the dark. 
The convention and visitors bureau will be my next call.

Good morning, 
I wanted to follow-up with you to let you know that we have not been able to find any 
information on the two individuals below. 
I will tell you that the convention business in New Orleans is very busy. Our event is held here every year, but is 
very small in comparison to many other meetings and conventions that are held here on a non-regular basis. If 
there's a possibility that they could have attended another event that was in the city, you may want to contact the 
New Orleans Convention & Visitors Bureau (www.neworleanscvb.com) to see what other events may have 
occurred during that time. I do not know how far their records go back, but having worked in hotels in the city, I 
know that they publish lists to its members of meetings taking place in the city. 
Sony we couldn't be of more help.

Hello Agent 
IMPORTANT. I am writing a book and producing a documentary on a significant child trafficking case and understand you 
have been assigned to this particular case. 
Jeffrey Epstein will most likely leave the country (right after he completes house arrest on 7/21/10), for good. He does not 
have to remain in the US since he does not NEED TO EVER work, or represent clients. He knows he CANNOT and has no 
interest in soliciting new clients. He has made enough money ($2 billion assets according to last income tax return), to 
personally manage his wealth and thereby save the 2% fee usually paid to an investment banker who manages large 
portfolios. 
Epstein will be free in 2 months and continue to damage vulnerable and underage girls in other countries. 
He doesn't ever NEED to work. 
Question: Why hasn't the FBI not contacted attorney Robert Josefsberg in Miami in order to speak with victim 
in Australia? THIS IS STEP 1 if the FBI is truly interested in arresting him on child sex trafficking charges. 
is Jane Doe 102 in case # 09-80656. She was trafficked and prostituted and now lives with her husband and 
babyin Australia. He settled last year with her for pennies (in comparison to what he's worth), and she now has a gag order. 
I 
is key witness since she was on his plane many times being paid to perform sexual activities with heads of state, 
leading businessmen, royalty, politicians and celebrities. 
Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter and if you have any questions you may reach me via email or telephone

Hi 
I received a telephone message fro 
She has contacted us in the 
past an is currently making several calls to the FBI regarding Jeffrey Epstein. In her calls to the FBI, she claims 
that she is doing a documentary and writing a book regarding human trafficking and about Epstein's use of a 
modeling agency to assist him in trafficking underage girls into the United States to use in sexual conduct. 
A few years ago, FBI tried to get documentation from her "source" regarding these allegations, but the "source" 
didn't appear for interviews and never provided documentation. Sarnoff recently began calling FBI Miami to 
again make these allegations. It is my understanding that FBI has told Samoff that if her "source" wants to come 
forward with evidence and be interviewed, FBI is more than willing to listen, but Sarnoff is dissatisfied with that 
response. 
Obviously I haven't called 
ack, but I assume that she is calling us for the same reason. If so, can 
you direct her to 
at t e BI? 
Thank you!

Thank you for calling me today. I am confused about certain legal issues. When I ask erl 
 his 
morning why Jeffrey Epstein was not charged with child sex trafficking given the 2000 TVPA federal laws, she 
EFTA00019173
--- PAGE 2 ---
did not want to respond. It s an important question that merits a substantial answer. 
In light of the arguments surrounding the case I would like to know: 
I. Why was Jeffrey Epstein allowed to plead guilty to a single count of solicitation of minors to engage in 
prostitution? 
2. In light of the 5 trafficking offenses outlined on pages 1 & 2 of the NPA signed 10/29/07, why was Epstein 
given a twelve (12) months and six (6) months in a county jail (he served only 13 months), for all charges 
without adjudication or sentencing, and without probation or community control? 
3. Unlike any other registered sex offender in the U.S. prison system today why didn't he serve time in a State 
penitentiary? Why was Epstein placed in a solitary cell at the West Palm Beach Stockade and only part time? 
Why was he allowed to go to "work" outside of prison for 13 months during the entire day? 
4. Why didn't Epstein like all other registered sex offenders in the U.S. have an attached electronic monitor 
during his house confinement? 
5. Why was prosecution for the offenses deferred in favor of prosecution by the State of Florida? 
6. In the ADDENDUM to the NPA (7A-C), Epstein is given the right to select and approve independent third 
party counselors for the victims. Why? 
7.According to the NPA signed by MV there are 5 federal trafficking offenses. Why were they dismissed or 
deferred? 
8. Why is Epstein given the right to contest damages up to an amount agreed to between the victims and Epstein? 
9. Esptein's signature on NPA "is not to be construed as an admission of civil or criminal liability or a waiver 
of..." Please explain. Why? 
10. What was the "gain time" Epstein earned during his period of incarceration? 
11. Why would the NPA not be part of a public record? And why would the US have to provide notice to Epstein 
before making disclosure under a FOIA request? 
12. Why was the Federal Grand Jury investigation suspended? 
13. Wh the the US a 
e not to institute an criminal ch 
es a ainst his co cons irators Ghislaine Maxwell, 
n light of the evidence? 
14. Why are the grand jury subpoenas going to be withdrawn at the completion of the terms of the NPA? given 
that he is a registered sex offender and that most probably he will commit the crimes shortly after his release next 
month (this assumption based on empirical and medical data obtained from registered sex offenders), there 
seems to be no protection mechanism for the victims in place? 
15. Why was JE allowed to choose the attorney's for the victims and put a cap on their restitution? 
16. Why was the Federal investigation stopped by the USAG? 
17. Why hasn't Epstein been rearrested given the 11+ parole violations reported to the parole board since his 
home confinement including weekly trips to NY and helicpter ride to travel only 9 miles? 
Sincerely,

Thanks for the advanced notice, we should definitely discuss, particularly since there are rules about press contacts in our 
pending case that we're mindful of. 2:15 p.m. works for us. On timing, do you have a sense of when you anticipate this

As an FYI, I am really calling to get the contact information for your PIO since there will be reporting in our local news and 
my USA wants to make a statement, but we want to run this by you all and your PIO first. As for time, does 2:15pm ET 
work for you all? If so, I can get a conference line set up for that time.

Well done on the new indictment against Ms. Maxwell. We were pleased to see that conduct in New Mexico formed the 
basis of one of your overt acts. I know that you all are very busy, but if you a moment for a brief call to discuss the 
impact, if any, of the new indictment on seizure/forfeiture of Epstein's NM property, I would appreciate it. As you are

Yes, a call on 9/12 at 1:30 MT / 3:30 ET will work for us, thanks very much. 
As a preview in response t 
email, we spoke with the New Mexico AG's office back in July 2019. In essence, 
they agreed to cease any i 
gau n nto sex trafficking and share whatever they had gathered to date regarding sex 
trafficking activity with our office. We agreed that they were free to proceed with whatever other investigations 
(unrelated to sex trafficking) they may have concerning Epstein and told them that at the conclusion of our case, we 
would pass along any information we may have gathered about state crimes that were committed in their jurisdiction. 
We have not communicated with anyone from the New Mexico AG's office since that conversation in July 2019.

FYI: state authorities in New Mexico are moving forward with their own plans with respect to the Epstein property. 
Yesterday the state land commissioner revoked leases held by Cypress Inc. 
https://www.abqjournal.com/1362185/land-commissioner-voids-epsteins-nm-grazing-leases.html 
The linked news coverage quotes the New Mexico Attorney General as saying that he is conducting a criminal 
investigation at the state level "in coordination with" the SDNY. Here are a few sentences from late in the article: 
EFTA00019190
--- PAGE 9 ---
The [State] Attorney General's Office is investigating whether crimes took place on Zorro Ranch. [State Land 
Commissioner Stephanie] Garcia Richard said Wednesday her office had notified [State] Attorney General 
Hector Balderas to provide notice if any criminal activity was found to have occurred on the trust land leased 
by Epstein "because we were looking for a reason to cancel these leases and criminal activity would have given 
us the perfect reason." 
Balderas did issue a statement saying he was pleased Garcia Richard was "taking back lands that should be 
managed to best serve the State and for the benefit of New Mexico school children." Public schools are one 
beneficiary of state trust land revenue. Balderas added: "We continue to investigate this matter at the state level 
in coordination with U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York."

Thanks very much, Glen. Let's plan for 1pm on Thursday, 11/12. I will circulate a WebEx invitation shortly. 
We expect to ask Mr. 
about his interactions with 
the U.S. Customs and Border Protection 
employee who worked in Saint Thomas and who had Mr. 
listed as a contact in his phone. I expect we will ask for 
an approximate timeline of when Mr. 
met and interacted with 
the nature of those interactions, and any 
interactions 
may have had with Epstein (to the best of Mr. 
knowledge). 
Best, 
Assistant United States Attorney

Sorry for the delay. Looks like we can do between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. on Tuesday, 11/10, or any time on Thursday, 11/12. 
Let us know if anything in that range will work. 
So as to make sure Mr. 
is prepared, can you give us an overview of what you expect to cover? 
Thanks,

As I believe we mentioned when we last spoke, we would like to schedule time for a second interview with Mr. 
via 
WebEx. Are there any days the week of November 9th when your team and Mr. 
would be available? We would 
expect this proffer to be much shorter than our first, and certainly no more than two hours at most.

Thanks for sending the WebEx invitation for Wednesday's meeting to me. For whatever reason, the system is not 
permitting me to forward the invite, so I would ask that you separately invite those copied on this e-mail: Dan, Danielle

The Maxwell Laptop is ready to be picked up in room 307. We removed all the laptops electronic communication, so it 
has no Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or Ethernet connection capabilities. We tested access to the production data with the backup 
BOP production and works fine. We placed a sticker on the laptop with the password. 
Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks so much, 
Is the laptop large enough to save any of Maxwell's discovery on it? Or would doing so just slow 
it down? I ask because her attorneys requested that we load her discovery onto the laptop if possible.

Dear 
Enclosed is a laptop for Ghislaine Maxwell, an inmate at the Metropolitan Detention 
Center. We are providing this laptop to Ms. Maxwell for the sole purpose of reviewing discovery 
materials in connection with the above-captioned case. The laptop has been reviewed by support 
staff at our Office, who have informed us that they have successfully modified the laptop to meet 
the specifications you have requested. In particular, we have been informed that: 
• 
The laptop contains a microphone and camera, which have both been disabled. As a result, 
the laptop has no recording capabilities. 
• 
The laptop does not contain any programs for games. 
• 
Communication capabilities have been disabled. In particular, the laptop has no Wi-Fi, 
Bluetooth, or Ethernet connection capabilities.

Lawsuit Claims Epstein Trafficked Girls in 
Caribbean Until 2018 
The attorney general of the Virgin Islands says Mr. Epstein and his associates used a database to 
track victims as young as 11 years old.

By Ali Watkins 
Jan. 15, 2020Updated 2:41 p.m. ET 
New evidence shows Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused and trafficked hundreds of young women and 
girls on his private Caribbean island, some as recently as 2018, significantly expanding the scope of 
his alleged conduct, a top law enforcement official said in a lawsuit filed on Wednesday. 
Mr. Epstein, a wealthy financier who died by suicide in a Manhattan jail last year, was bringing girls 
as young as 11 and 12 to his secluded estate in the Virgin Islands, known as Little Saint James, and 
kept a computerized database to track the availability and movements of women and girls, the 
lawsuit said. 
The lawsuit, which was filed by Denise N. George, the attorney general of the Virgin Islands, 
broadened the dimensions of the wrongdoing in which Mr. Epstein was said to have engaged. He had 
been charged by Manhattan prosecutors in July with sexually exploiting dozens of women and girls in 
New York and Florida, but they did not point to any actions beyond 2005. 
In August, Mr. Epstein hanged himself at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, where he was being 
held awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking and conspiracy charges. Prison guards had not checked 
on him for hours on the night he died, and the circumstances surrounding his death are now the 
subject of at least three federal investigations.
In the weeks before Mr. Epstein killed himself, he and his lawyers vigorously denied the criminal 
charges. His lawyers had previously said he had been law-abiding since his 2008 conviction in 
Florida for solicitation. 
The suit was filed against Mr. Epstein's estate and seeks the forfeiture of Little Saint James and Mr. 
Epstein's second private island, Great Saint James, as well as the dissolution of numerous shell 
EFTA00019224
--- PAGE 3 ---
companies he established in the territory that officials have said acted as fronts for his sex trafficking 
enterprise. 
As part of its policies, the government of the Virgin Islands could take any assets recovered from Mr. 
Epstein's estate and consider disbursing them to women and girls who were victimized by him in the 
region, Ms. George said. 
The new accusations — which draw both from independent investigations by Ms. George's office and 
court documents from cases across the country — argue that Mr. Epstein ran a decades-long sex 
trafficking scheme that had a primary nexus in the Virgin Islands.

--- PAGE 5 ---
"Epstein clearly used the Virgin Islands and his residence in the U.S. Virgin Islands at Little Saint 
James as a way to be able to conceal and to be able to expand his activity here," Ms. George said. 
The suit underscores the legal complications of reckoning with such wide-reaching crimes as those 
Mr. Epstein is said to have committed. Ms. George's suit is the first filed against the estate by a 
government entity, but it joins a field of similar claims filed by more than a dozen women. 
It remains unclear how Mr. Epstein's assets, which are valued at about $500 million, could be 
allocated. 
"We don't have a long history of figuring out what to do in cases of human trafficking," said Bridgette 
Can, the director of the Human Trafficking Clinic at the University of Michigan Law School, who 
consulted with Ms. George's team on the case. "I think this litigation and the courts are just trying to 
come up with the best, imperfect solution." 
Mr. Epstein's executor, Darren K. Indyke, could not immediately be reached for comment. 
Ms. George said she believed the case could chip away at the region's reputation as a notorious haven 
for the rich and powerful. 
"We will not remain complacent, and we will enforce our laws whatever way we can," Ms. George 
said. "It doesn't matter the social status of the person. It's that the laws apply equally."

The court documents said that Mr. Epstein operated with impunity for years at Little Saint James 
and Great Saint James, which he obtained through a straw purchaser in 2016. 
As recently as July 2018, Mr. Epstein refused to permit an investigator from the Virgin Island's 
Department of Justice to enter Little Saint James, claiming the island's dock was his "front door," 
according to the lawsuit. The investigator was doing routine monitoring of Mr. Epstein because he 
was a registered sex offender. 
Mr. Epstein's victims included aspiring models from South America, according to court documents. 
EFTA00019227
--- PAGE 6 ---
Mr. Epstein used a ring of associates to rotate the women and girls in and out of sexual servitude, 
using fraudulent modeling visas to transport them across state lines and international borders, the 
lawsuit said. He tracked their availability and proximity using the database, court documents said. 
The suit also said air traffic controllers in the Virgin Islands observed Mr. Epstein leaving his private 
plane in 2018 with girls who looked as young as 11. 
In one undated incident detailed in the lawsuit, a 15-year-old girl attempted to swim off Mr. Epstein's 
island and escape after she was forced to engage in sex acts with Mr. Epstein and others. The girl was 
found, and held captive on the island after he confiscated her passport, the suit said. 
Prosecutors in New York have said their investigation has continued and anyone who helped Mr. 
Epstein could face criminal charges.
In addition, the lawsuit said, Mr. Epstein embarked on several illegal construction projects at Great 
Saint James, which caused damage to native coral and wildlife. 
Continue reading  the main story 
The more than a dozen women who have filed lawsuits against Mr. Epstein's estate in New York City 
since his death have accused him of exploiting and sexually abusing them when they were young 
women and girls, according to court documents. Many are seeking financial compensation. 
The lawsuit in the Virgin Islands appears to be the first filed against the estate in that jurisdiction. 
Mr. Epstein maintained his legal permanent residence — and his estate — there. He hastily filed his 
will in a Virgin Islands court just days before he killed himself. 
Ms. George's lawsuit also seeks to head off an effort by Mr. Epstein's executor, Mr. Indyke, to turn 
Mr. Epstein's vast wealth into a victim's compensatory fund. Mr. Indyke's proposal, which is 
currently being litigated in a separate Virgin Islands case, imposes confidentiality on any claimants, 
Ms. George said. 
"The estate continues to engage in a course of conduct aimed at concealing the criminal activities of 
the Epstein enterprise," the lawsuit said. 
In a statement when that fund was first announced, Mr. Indyke said it would give victims "the 
opportunity to obtain appropriate compensation and to be heard and treated with compassion, 
dignity and respect."

Hi •

The BOP would like to convene a Board of Inquiry (relevant Program Statement attached) that would review operations 
generally at MCC New York. Among other issues, it will look at local policy and procedures related to special housing, review 
camera operations, and review training and staffing issues. This will not, of course, be a misconduct investigation. Should the 
Board come across anything that appears to be new misconduct allegations, they will be reported consistent with normal 
misconduct reporting requirements. 
We are mindful of the on-going criminal investigation, and are aware that administrative charges may also arise connected to 
the criminal case. We will studiously avoid creating any sort of conflict with that case. Please let me know if you have 
additional questions or would like to discuss. Thanks in advance.

Hey guys, 
CNN is pursuing a story about how 
2015/2016 to raise questions about the Epstein plea deal in Florida. 
talked to a sex trafficking or human trafficking AUSA (no name yet) 
was not raised to senior leadership at the time and it went nowhere. 
CNN doesn't plan to run something immediately but knows 
if they fed their competition will go with the story, they will, too. 
Any guidance or thoughts are welcome.

Jeffrey Epstein's scandal of 
secrecy points to a creeping rot 
in the American justice system 
When rich people are credibly accused of crimes, does the public have a right to 
know? Should multimillionaires be allowed to silence their accusers with cash? 
According to superlawyer David Boies, "dozens" of women who could give 
testimony about being  sexually assaulted as girls by mysterious financier Jeffrey 
Epstein are silenced by settlements they reached with their alleged assailant. The 
exact number is yet another secret in this least transparent of criminal cases. 
"Three dozen or eight dozen, I don't know, but there are dozens," Boies told me 
recently. He himself represents two alleged Epstein victims bound by "non-
disclosure agreements" (NDAs). 
Because Epstein can afford to buy silence, he may succeed in shuttering the 
window of accountability pried open in a South Florida court back in February. 
U.S. District Judge Kenneth A. Marra ruled that federal prosecutors — led by the 
EFTA00019249
--- PAGE 2 ---
current labor secretary, Alexander Acosta — broke the law by entering a secret 
sweetheart deal to allow Epstein to serve a cushy sentence without facing evidence 
that he assaulted more than 3o underage girls in Palm Beach. 
That ruling may prove hollow, however, if the alleged victims are now gagged by 
their settlements with Epstein. What a galling next chapter that would be in this 
appalling story. 
Epstein, whose enormous and unexplained wealth attracted a circle of friends that 
included Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, actor Kevin Spacey and Britain's Prince 
Andrew, travels from mansion to mansion while poor men accused of lesser 
crimes rot in prison. 
This scandal of secrecy points to a creeping rot in the American justice system. 
Too many cases involving potential felonies are resolved through civil settlements 
that include ironclad NDAs. Once the money changes hands, witnesses can no 
longer testify to crimes; indeed, penalties for telling the truth after a settlement 
often run to the millions of dollars — ruinous for most crime victims. It's a short 
step removed from silencing witnesses with cement shoes. 
"It is a classic case of rich man's justice," said Boies. Add the fact that wealthy 
predators often target victims in financial need. That was allegedly Epstein's M.O. 
as he sent recruiters into working-class neighborhoods in search of teenagers to 
give him "massages." The rich exploit the poverty of their victims to extract 
promises of silence — backed by the force of law because the NDAs are binding 
contracts. 
What's needed is a simple change to the law, Boies contends: "Simply say that 
agreements to conceal evidence of a crime are not enforceable." 
The Epstein case is particularly creepy but not unique. The #MeToo movement 
has revealed the pernicious misuse of NDAs to enable crime. Powerful men such 
as producer Harvey Weinstein  and television executive Leslie Moonves reportedly 
made use of the agreements to hide evidence of sexual assault or harassment. This 
secrecy in turn allowed offenders to target additional victims. 
That's where the public interest comes in. Crime is not just a matter between an 
offender and a victim; crime is also an offense against the public order. The public 
EFTA00019250
--- PAGE 3 ---
has an important stake in punishing past crimes and preventing future offenses. 
Purchased secrecy interferes with those aims. 
Some attorneys say NDAs are the only protection the rich and famous have 
against unfounded accusations. But that doesn't bear much scrutiny. A person 
who might falsely claim to be a victim has more to fear from sunlight than from 
secrecy. And anyone who pays hush money to cover up false allegations is only 
encouraging more extortion. 
I am beginning to worry that the fresh breeze of openness that appeared to be 
blowing through the stink of the Epstein case might be smothered by secrecy. 
Attorneys for Epstein's Palm Beach accusers are losing confidence that their 
clients will ever tell their stories in court. 
Meanwhile, a panel of appeals court judges in New York has gone silent in a 
related matter. British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, an Epstein friend and 
confidante, is battling to keep details of her settlement with an Epstein accuser 
sealed from public view. In a March hearing at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
2nd Circuit, Judge Jose A. Cabranes openly scoffed at Maxwell's attorney as he 
argued for secrecy. Yet here we are on the cusp of summer, and the court has not 
been heard from. When will a ray of sunshine pierce the cloud of money? 
If anything good can come out of this miserable case, maybe this is it: Lawmakers 
can seize this outrageous moment to outlaw the silencing of witnesses through 
NDAs. The agreements have their place in civil matters, but not to mask evidence 
of crimes. The legal system, meanwhile, can do the right thing. Open the Maxwell 
files. Then launch a full-fledged investigation of Epstein's conduct in New York, 
New Mexico and the Virgin Islands: places where the tainted South Florida 
agreement cannot protect him.

The seven reproduced items will consist of one Excel file and six PDFs, so they'll be small enough to email to defense

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 
The only issue before the Court is whether conditions exist that can reasonably assure 
Ms. Maxwell's appearance during this case. On this renewed application, Ms. Maxwell has put 
before the Court a significant bail package, supported by detailed submissions, which warrant 
her release on strict conditions. She and her spouse have committed to signing a bond in the full 
amount of their net worth, regardless of the ownership of the underlying assets. She has 
proffered seven additional sureties, consisting of her family and close friends, many of whom are 
U.S. citizens and long-time residents, who have come forward at great personal risk and have 
pledged meaningful assets. The government does not challenge the good faith and bona fides of 
these proposed sureties. She has provided a detailed report from a respected accounting firm, 
which was further reviewed by a former IRS special agent, setting forth a statement of her 
financial condition, supported by voluminous documentation. The government does not 
challenge the report's findings, nor its underlying documentation. She has agreed, in writing, to 
give up any right she has or could have to contest extradition and submit to all other standard 
travel restrictions. And she has noted that a key representation made by the government at the 
initial bail hearing as to the strength of its evidence is simply not accurate --
and there is no "significant contemporaneous documentary 
evidence" that corroborates its case. 
With regard to any other defendant, this record would readily support release on strict 
bail conditions, perhaps even on consent. But this is Ghislaine Maxwell, the apparent substitute 
for Jeffrey Epstein. So, instead, in its response the government urges the Court to disregard the 
significant additional evidence proffered to the Court and further argues that a defendant cannot 
be eligible for bail (apparently on any conditions), unless she can provide an absolute guarantee 
against all risks. But this is not the legal standard. United States v. Orta, 760 F.2d 887, 888 n.4, 
EFTA00019295
--- PAGE 6 ---
892-93 (8th Cir. 1985) ("The legal standard required by the [Bail Reform] Act is one of reasonable 
assurances, not absolute guarantees."). Under, the Bail Reform Act, a defendant must be released 
unless there are "no conditions" that would reasonably assure her presence. Here, the proposed 
package satisfies the actual governing standard, and the Court should grant bail. 
ARGUMENT 
I. 
The Government Concedes that Its Case Relies Almost Exclusively on the 
Testimony of Three Witnesses 
In evaluating the strength of the government's case in its prior ruling, the Court relied on 
the government's proffer that the testimony of the three accusers would be corroborated by 
"significant contemporaneous documentary evidence." (Tr. 82 (emphasis added)). The 
government now expressly retreats from this position. It is abundantly clear from the 
government's response that it has no "significant contemporaneous documentary evidence"—in 
fact, it has virtually no documentary corroboration at all—and that its case against Ms. Maxwell 
is based almost exclusively on the recollections of the three accusers, who remain unidentified, 
concerning events that took place over 25 years ago. Moreover, the government offers no 
specificity about when within the four-year period of the charged conspiracy the alleged 
incidents of abuse took place. This, alone, is grounds for the Court to reconsider its prior ruling. 
The few examples of documentary corroboration referenced by the government—which 
are the same examples that the government touted at the initial bail hearing—pertain to Epstein, 
not Ms. Maxwell. The government concedes that 
(Gov. Mem. at 11 (emphasis added)). The 
government further states that 
(Id. 
(emphasis added)). The strength of the government's case against Jeffrey Epstein is not at issue 
EFTA00019296
--- PAGE 7 ---
here. Whether or not the accusers' recollections as to Epstein are corroborated is irrelevant to 
the strength of the evidence against Ms. Maxwell. 
The only purported corroboration that pertains in any way to Ms. Maxwell is of marginal 
value. The government references 
■ 
(Id. at 11). But even the government concedes that, at best, 
It is clear that the only evidence that Ms. Maxwell allegedly "groomed" the accusers or 
knowingly facilitated or participated in Epstein's sexual abuse of minors will come solely from 
the testimony of the three accusers. The government's case against Ms. Maxwell therefore rests 
entirely on the credibility and reliability of these three witnesses.2 Moreover, the substantive 
counts (Counts Two and Four) are based on the testimony of only one witness, Minor Victim-1. 
It is also telling that the government does not even attempt to rebut the defense's assertion that it 
did not begin issuing subpoenas for documents related to Ms. Maxwell until just after the death 
of Jeffrey Epstein. This confirms that the case against Ms. Maxwell was assembled after the fact 
I The government also proffers that they will have "additional witnesses." (Gov. Mem. at 11). But these are not 
"outcry" witnesses who will corroborate a contemporaneous account of abuse from one or more of the accusers. 
Instead, they will testify only that "both [Ms. Maxwell] and Epstein knew and interacted with certain minor victims 
when those victims were minors." (Id.). Again, the fact that Ms. Maxwell may have "met and interacted with" 
someone when they were a minor proves absolutely nothing. 
One of the witnesses has submitted a letter to the Court. While the CV RA permits the right to be heard, the letter 
should be given no legal weight in the Court's bail analysis. See United States v. Turner, 367 F. Supp. 2d 319, 33 I-
(E.D.N.Y. 2005) 
EFTA00019297
--- PAGE 8 ---
as a substitute for its prosecution of Epstein.; The government's case is not what it represented 
to the Court at the initial bail hearing, which should weigh heavily in favor of granting bail.4
II. 
The Government Has Not Carried Its Burden 
A. 
The Government Asks the Court to Ignore Ms. Maxwell's Substantial 
Ties to the United States, Including Her Spouse-
The government incorrectly argues that the renewed bail application offers no new 
information and that the Court was "already aware of the defendant's friends and family in 
the United States. (Gov. Mem. at 13). The government ignores that, since the initial bail 
hearing, Ms. Maxwell's spouse has come forward as a co-signor and has submitted a 
detailed letter describing his committed relationship with Ms. Maxwell for over four years 
and the important role she has played, and continues to play, 
It also ignores that several of Ms. Maxwell's closest friends and family, many of 
whom are U.S. citizens and residents, have also come forward, at considerable personal risk, 
to support her bond with pledges of assets or letters of support. This information, which 
was not available to the Court at the time of the initial hearing, demonstrates Ms. Maxwell's 
strong ties to this country and weighs heavily in favor of bail. 
Rather than address the merits, the government attempts to dismiss the significance 
of Ms. Maxwell's relationship with her spouse, noting that Ms. Maxwell told Pretrial 
Services that she was in the process of getting a divorce and that her spouse did not step 
forward as a co-signer at the initial bail hearing. (Id. at 13-14). The government is entirely 
Moreover, the government failure to requesill.MMI 
regardless of whether it was legally obligated to 
do so. shows that the government has accept 
e accusers accounts without serious scrutiny. Given the 
ovenunent's ongoing Brach• obligations, it is unsettling that the government would simply acc 
Contrary to the government's assertion. the defense has not abandoned our legal challenges to the indictment. 
(Gov. Mem. at 10 n.1). We believe we have strong arguments that have only gotten stronger with the production of 
discovery. We will be making those arguments to the Court in our pretrial motions to be filed next month. 
EFTA00019298
--- PAGE 9 ---
mistaken. Prior to her arrest, Ms. Maxwell and her spouse had discussed the idea of getting 
a divorce as an additional way to create distance between Ms. Maxwell and her spouse to 
protect him-from 
the terrible consequences of being associated with her. 
Nevertheless, in the weeks following the initial bail hearing, 
She and her spouse therefore had no reason to continue 
discussing divorce, which neither of them wanted in the first place. Nor was there any 
reason for her spouse to refrain from stepping forward as a co-signer. In sum, the 
government has offered nothing but unsupported innuendo to suggest that Ms. Maxwell's 
relationship with her spouse 
is not a powerful tie to this country. 
The government's assertion that Ms. Maxwell must not have a close relationship 
with 
is particularly callous 
and belied by the facts. (Gov. Mem. at 14). As her spouse explains, 
(Ex. A ¶ 12). 
B. 
Ms. Maxwell Has Thoroughly Disclosed Her Finances and Pledged All of 
Her and Her Spouse's Assets in Support of Her Bond 
The government's attempts to rebut the financial condition report are unavailing. 
Significantly, the government does not contest the accuracy of the report, nor the 
voluminous supporting documentation. In fact, the government has proffered nothing that 
calls into question the report's detailed account of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse's assets for 
the last five years, which addresses one of the Court's principal reasons for denying bail. 
Rather than question the report itself, the government attempts to argue that Ms. 
Maxwell deceived the Court and Pretrial Services about her assets. (Gov. Mem. at 22-23). 
EFTA00019299
--- PAGE 10 ---
The report shows nothing of the sort. Ms. Maxwell, who was sitting in a jail cell at the time, 
was asked by Pretrial Services to estimate her assets. Accordingly, she gave her best 
estimate of the assets she held in her own name, which the government concedes she did 
with remarkable accuracy considering that she had not reviewed her financial statements.5
The government's arguments further confirm that it has lost all objectivity and will 
view at any fact involving Ms. Maxwell in the worst possible light. For example, the 
government asserts that Ms. Maxwell has demonstrated "sophistication in hiding her assets" 
and characterizes her transfers to a trust as "funneling" assets to her spouse to "hide her true 
wealth." (Id. at 24). There is nothing unusual, let alone nefarious or even particularly 
sophisticated about transferring assets into a trust or a spouse. Indeed, Ms. Maxwell fully 
disclosed these transactions on her joint tax returns. More importantly, all of the assets 
disclosed in the financial report, whether they are owned by Ms. Maxwell or her spouse, are 
included in the bond amount and are subject to forfeiture if she flees. 
The government further argues that the financial condition report shows that Ms. 
Maxwell has access to millions of dollars of "unrestrained funds" that she could use to flee 
the country and reimburse any of her sureties for the loss of their security. (Id. at 23). That 
characterization is simply untrue. First, as disclosed in the financial report, Ms. Maxwell 
has procured significant loans on the basis of a negative pledge over her London property. 
Second, the $4 million controlled by her spouse 
could only be liquidated with considerable difficulty. 
The government also faults Ms. Maxwell for not including a valuation of future 
contingent assets and income that may never materialize. (Id. at 23-24). For example,. 
Moreover, for the reasons discussed in our initial memorandum, Ms. Maxwell was reluctant to discuss anything 
about her spouse and clearly expressed her reluctance to Pretrial Services early on in the interview. 
EFTA00019300
--- PAGE 11 ---
Similarly, the financial report does not include 
a future income stream for Ms. Maxwell or her spouse because it presents only historical 
and current assets. Even so, Ms. Maxwell has no certain future income stream. Her spouse 
El and has had to liquidate his existing investments to help Ms. Maxwell. Finally, the 
reference to 
is gratuitous. Ms. Maxwell had no knowledge of 
But the larger point is this: Ms. Maxwell has proposed a substantial bail package 
with multiple co-signers and significant security. She and her spouse have pledged all of 
their assets in support of the bond. Ms. Maxwell's wealth is not a reason to deny her bail. It 
is a reason to set appropriately strict conditions that will result in significant financial 
consequences to Ms. Maxwell and her friends and family if she leaves the country. The 
proposed bail package does exactly that.°
C. 
The Government's Assertion that Ms. Maxwell Is "Adept" at Hiding and 
Therefore a Flight Risk Is Specious 
The government continues to assert the sinister narrative that Ms. Maxwell had "an 
expertise at remaining hidden," and that it would therefore be easy for her to become a fugitive. 
The government's argument that her spouse's moral suasion is diminished because Ms. Maxwell brought the 
majority of assets to the relationship is nonsensical. (Id. at 24-25). Regardless of whose money it was to begin with, 
all of the assets of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse will be forfeited if she flees and her spouse 
will be 
left with nothing. Furthermore, the government's assertion that they could not verify the spouse's financial 
information because Ms. Maxwell did not provide his current banking information is false. (Id. at 24 n.9). The 
defense provided the spouse's current banking records and only redacted the name of the bank. 
EFTA00019301
--- PAGE 12 ---
(Gov. Mem. at 20). The government suggests that purchasing a home using a trust and providing 
a pseudonym to a real estate broker are indicative of her willingness and ability to live in hiding 
and somehow forecast Ms. Maxwell's intention to flee. (Id.). These arguments are just further 
evidence that the government will frame every fact about Ms. Maxwell in the worst possible 
light. As the defense has already argued extensively in its initial brief, these steps were borne 
out of necessity to protect Ms. Maxwell and her family from harassment and physical threats. 
Moreover, they are not predictive of flight. There is simply no basis to conclude, based on the 
measures that Ms. Maxwell was forced to take to protect herself and her family, that she would 
then willingly abandon that family to become a fugitive from justice. To the contrary, she 
remained in the country precisely to remain close to them and to defend her case. 
D. 
Extradition from France or the United Kingdom Is Highly Unlikely 
The government dismisses Ms. Maxwell's willingness to waive her extradition rights as 
to France and the United Kingdom as "meaningless" because Ms. Maxwell cannot guarantee 
with absolute certainty that either country will enforce the waiver. (Gov. Mem. at 14). The 
government misses the point: Ms. Maxwell's willingness to do everything she can to eliminate 
her ability to refuse extradition to the fullest extent possible demonstrates her firm commitment 
to remain in this country to face the charges against her and, as Ms. Maxwell's French and U.K. 
experts confirm, there is every reason to believe that both authorities would consider the waiver 
as part of any extradition request. 
In an attempt to counter William Julie's expert report stating it is "highly unlikely" that 
the French government would refuse to extradite Ms. Maxwell (Def. Mem., Ex. V at 2), the 
government attaches a letter from the French Ministry of Justice ("MOJ") that references neither 
Mr. Julie's report nor Ms. Maxwell, but states generally that the French Code of Criminal 
Procedure "absolutely prohibits" the extradition of a French national. (Gov. Mem., Ex. B). But 
EFTA00019302
--- PAGE 13 ---
as Mr. Julie's accompanying rebuttal report explains (see Ex. A), the MOJ letter ignores that the 
extradition provisions in French Code of Criminal Procedure apply only in the absence of an 
international agreement providing otherwise. (Id. at 1). This rule is necessitated by the French 
Constitution, which requires that international agreements prevail over national legislation. (Id.). 
Thus, extradition of a French national to the United States is legally permissible if the extradition 
treaty between the United States and France provides for it—which it does. (Id. at 3). 
The government's reliance on a 2006 case—in which France refused to extradite a 
French national who was also a U.S. citizen—provides no precedent as to how a French court 
would rule on an extradition request regarding Ms. Maxwell because, as Mr. Julie notes, the 
United States did not challenge the refusal in the French courts. (Id. at 2-3). Nor does it 
undermine Mr. Julie's opinion that, in the unusual circumstance where a citizen of both countries 
has executed an extradition waiver and then fled to France in violation of bail conditions set by a 
U.S. court, it is "highly unlikely" that an extradition decree would not be issued. (Id. at 3). 
The government offers no rebuttal to the opinion of Ms. Maxwell's U.K. extradition 
expert, David Perry. Nor does it dispute Mr. Perry's opinion that Ms. Maxwell would be "highly 
unlikely" to successfully resist extradition from the United Kingdom, that her waiver would be 
admissible in any extradition proceeding, and that—contrary to the government's representation 
at the initial bail hearing (Tr. 27)—bail would be "extremely unlikely." (See Def. Mem. Ex. U at 
¶ 39). Mr. Perry's addendum opinion (attached as Ex. B) reiterates these points, opining that the 
waiver would be "a highly relevant factor" in the U.K. proceeding, both to the likelihood of 
extradition and to the likelihood of bail while the proceeding is pending. (Id. ¶ 3): 
Nor, as the government suggests, does the Secretary of State have general "discretion to deny extradition" after a 
court has entered a final extradition order. (See Gov. Mem. at 19). That discretion is limited to a handful of 
exceptional circumstances that would likely be inapplicable to Ms. Maxwell's case. (Id. 
4.5). 
EFTA00019303
--- PAGE 14 ---
Finally, the government's argument that Ms. Maxwell could always flee to some country 
other than the United Kingdom and France holds her—and any defendant—to an impossible 
standard, which is not the standard under the Bail Reform Act. (See Gov. Mem. at 19). By the 
government's reasoning, no defendant with financial means to travel could be granted bail, 
because there would always be a possibility that they could flee to another country (even if they 
had no ties there), and there could never be an assurance that any extradition waiver would be 
enforced. However, "Section 3142 does not seek ironclad guarantees." United States v. Chen, 
820 F. Supp. 1205, 1208 (N.D. Cal. 1992). To the extent that Ms. Maxwell's ties to France and 
the United Kingdom—where she has not lived for nearly 30 years—create a flight risk, her 
extradition waivers along with the substantial bail package proposed reasonably cure it.8
E. 
The Recent COVID Surge at MDC Further Justifies Bail 
The government suggests that the Court ignore COVID concerns because Ms. Maxwell, 
though quarantined because of contact with an officer who tested positive, did not become 
infected. This ignores the daily (sometimes multiple) inspections of Ms. Maxwell's mouth, 
which heightens her risk of contracting the deadly virus, which has now surged to 113 positive 
cases in the MDC. Further, Deputy Captain B. Houtz recently issued a memo stating that "[i]t 
has not been determined whether legal calls and legal visits will continue." As the Court is well 
aware, legal visits with Ms. Maxwell already have been suspended. Should legal calls also be 
discontinued, her constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel will be further eroded. 
CONCLUSION 
For the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that the Court order her 
release on bail pursuant to the strict conditions she has proposed. 
Any incentive Ms. Maxwell might have to flee to France has been greatly diminished by the recent arrest in France 
of Jean-Luc Brunel, who reportedly is under investigation for alleged sexual assaults by Jeffrey Epstein. See, e.g.,

Heys, 
Do you happen to recall where things stood with the Epstein estate regarding the subpoena for images and videos when 
you transitioned off the case? We want to check back in with the estate attorneys, but want to check where we left things 
before reaching out. In trying to figure out where things stand, I was looking through our past subpoenas, but couldn't 
find the subpoena to the estate covering images/videos. Do you know where I can find that?

All, 
Thanks for speaking with us yesterday. Below is the most current version of the statement of facts we 
have discussed. We want to emphasize that this is not a plea offer or a proposal, but we are passing this 
along since you've asked us to send you a draft that reflects our must recent discussions. This is not final 
from our perspective, and this may change following our conversations with victims during the conferral 
process. 
We recognize and respect that you will need to speak with your client this week. However, we do not 
want to delay notifying the victims, and, as we've discussed, we plan to issue a letter to the victims 
notifying them that we are in plea negotiations. That letter will need to go out this week. From our 
conversation, it sounds like you plan to meet with your client in the next few days, so let's plan to talk 
mid-week. 
Thanks, 
Between approximately 2001 and 2013 
worked for Jeffrey Epstein as a personal assistant. 
has been evaluated by an expert psychologist who specializes in victims of sexual trauma, who 
completed a report dated April 21, 2020 regarding 
experiences before, during, and after her 
employment with Epstein. The parties agree that the contents of the expert's report may be considered 
at sentencing, and the Government does not dispute that 
was herself a victim of sexual abuse by 
Epstein, as discussed in the expert report. 
During the period of her employment between approximately 2002 and 2005, as part of her duties to 
schedule appointments at the direction of Epstein and Maxwell, 
scheduled hundreds of 
appointments for women and girls, including dozens of minors, to massage Epstein. Over the course of 
that several year period, Epstein received approximately two to three massages per day, and during 
those massage appointments, Epstein sexually abused dozens of minor victims. The vast majority of the 
massage appointments that 
scheduled took place at Epstein's residence in Palm Beach, Florida, 
though some victims recall that 
arranged massages which took place at Epstein's residence in New 
York, New York. 
has reported that she has no recollection of scheduling massages for anyone in 
New York. 
did occasionally schedule massages to take place in Florida by phone while she was in 
New York City. When 
was first hired, she used a directory provided to her by Epstein's previous 
personal assistant and Ghislaine Maxwell to contact women and girls to massage Epstein. Over the 
ensuing years, 
would add new names to the directory when directed to do so by Epstein or 
Maxwell. 
EFTA00019317
--- PAGE 5 ---
Through the process of arranging and facilitating massage appointments for Epstein, 
met dozens 
of underage victims, who ranged in age from 14 to 17 years old. For example, when minor victims arrived 
for the appointments at Palm Beach, 
sometimes met them, walked them up to the massage room, 
and set up the massage table for the appointment. After some of the appointments, 
paid minor 
victims in cash. Epstein encouraged minor victims to bring other girls to massage him, which led to an 
increasing number of victims coming to massage Epstein at his residences. 
None of those victims told 
that they were underage. 
did know that some of those victims 
did not have their own cars, and 
arranged for a driver to pick them up and take them to their 
appointments with Epstein. Additionally, some of those victims told 
they could not attend certain 
appointment times because they were attending school. Epstein also told 
that at least one of 
those victims was studying for the SATs. 
During some of the massage appointments with minor girls that 
scheduled, Epstein sexually 
abused the minor girls by, among other things, 
In addition, the Government would be prepared to prove that 
witnessed some of the 
sexual abuse that occurred. In particular, one victim ("Victim-1") has informed law enforcement that 
was present for and participated in one massage when Victim-1 was a minor, during which Epstein 
touched Victim-l's 
Another victim ("Victim-2") has informed law enforcement that 
walked in on one instance in which Victim-2, a minor, was 
Epstein. Another victim 
("Victim-3") has informed law enforcement that 
walked in when Victim-3 was a minor and was 
in Epstein's massage room. 
has informed the U.S. Attorney's Office that she denies 
participating in any of the incidents described by Victim-1, Victim-2, and Victim-3. 
In or about 2005, 
learned that law enforcement was investigating Epstein for sex crimes involving 
minors, arising from the massage appointments, some of which 
had scheduled. After learning 
about the investigation into Epstein, at Epstein's direction, 
called multiple minor victims and 
encouraged them to "help" Epstein and conveyed that Epstein would help them if they helped him. 
encouraged them to talk to Epstein's investigator, offered that Epstein would pay for an attorney 
for them, and, in one or two cases, 
offered financial incentives to victims. 
understood that 
by asking her to make these calls, Epstein intended to dissuade the victims from speaking to law 
enforcement, and by agreeing to make the calls and take these steps, she was aiding him in this 
objective. Beginning in approximately 2006, multiple minor victims were interviewed by federal law 
enforcement officers who were conducting a criminal investigation of Epstein and his associates for sex 
trafficking of minors, among other federal offenses. During those interviews, minor victims reported to 
federal agents that Epstein paid them for sexualized massages while they were underage girls, including 
during massages that 
scheduled.

references to the "1953 Trust" apparently established on that date; note that 1953 is the year he was born.) 
In terms of other useful information, for all the cloak and dagger about who the executor was, it turns out it's his two 
main lawyers, Indyke and Kahn, who handle virtually all of his business activities (and of whom we were already well 
aware). It appears that those executors have the ability to deal with claims against the estate or its assets. 
As for where his assets actually go, it all goes to the "acting Trustees of the 1953 Trust" — i.e., nobody is named herein.

I just looped you in with 
GS of c19, which is leading investigation. They seem to be pretty on top of things 
and he shared some troubling details, which I can tell you later or you can get from agents. For now, you should be the 
USAO POC with C19; we will discuss with brass if that should remain the case.

Sorry but just related on the FBI and DOJ-OIG investigation, can we get a contact at each of those?? I know there's 
apparently no AUSA assigned yet to the FBI side, but for example I would want to let FBI and 016 know that someone is 
claiming to be at MCC and calling Epstein's associates to have them pick up the body — they'll be more likely to have 
traction with BOP than we will.

Yeah of course. In some ways I actually hope this is a hoax because if not, it's completely insane. And I just called 
but he didn't pick up. 
Separately, and speaking of the FBI investigation, defense counsel also says that they're starting to get people calling them 
who claim to have information relevant to Epstein's death, and are wondering if there is an investigative point person to 
whom they can direct any such people?

I'll call you separately in a moment, but just in case email is faster, I just received a phone call from defense counsel that a 
person close to Mr. Epstein received a phone call from an individual named

an investigator with the MCC and told the individual that Mr. Epstein's body was ready to be picked up at the hospital and 
that the individual could make arrangements for retrieval of the body. 
left his phone number as 
Can you please confirm whether that individual is in fact with BOP and/or MCC? Defense counsel is understandably 
concerned that they (and others with connections with Mr. Epstein) are starting to get hoax or otherwise inaccurate 
information through phone calls and emails. And we would again respectfully but urgently request that if there is 
information like this that needs to go to representatives for Mr. Epstein, that it come to us so we can pass it along to his 
counsel with confidence that it is true and accurate. 
(Separately, if it is accurate that BOP / MCC is prepared to release Mr. Epstein's body, his defense counsel is extremely 
concerned about whether that has been enough time for a full autopsy and any other investigative steps, and we would 
want to confirm that the FBI team addressing this matter has also been informed—but that's only if this is not a hoax, 
obviously.) 
Please advise as soon as possible, as the individual is waiting to know whether they should take steps to retrieve the body.

the information we have at this time pending the investigation. I am going into the secure perimeter to see if there is 
more information to share, but please be advised that some of what I get may be shared with your office but not further

It is frankly unbelievable to me that BOP is issuing public press releases on this before telling us basic information so that we 
can relay it to his attorneys who can relay it to his family. When can we expect to get either some sort of statement we can 
pass along to counsel as accurate and reliable or have a call with someone? 
I understand from the Marshals that they have been unsuccessful in reaching anyone with authority at BOP, and given the 
BOP press release that was just put out I assume we need to speak with someone there. Please advise. 
Thank 
you.

information in the press that we—the U.S. Attorney's Office—haven't yet received. We need to know as soon as possible 
the very basic facts, such as time and cause of death at the absolute minimum. It has now been hours since this was 
reported publicly. Please advise when we can expect to receive either a written report on those basic facts or when we can

On a related note, we are hearing that Jeffrey's autopsy may occur tomorrow morning. We would like to

asked if he was required to have a cellmate: 
o Discretionary matter; 
o Epstein was supposed to have a cellmate at all time per the warden. 
o When his cellmate was released, Epstein was in the attorney visiting area. 
o As a general practice, prior to the shift, the officers are briefed. The people in the SHU were supposed to 
be briefed down that Epstein was supposed to have a cellmate at all time. Officers have the authority to 
move cellmates. Captain was supposed to brief the Lt. who is supposed to brief down to the officers. 
Don't yet know whether the captain briefed the officers. 
We asked for follow-up materials relating the cellmate policy and whether this direction was committed to 
writing.

Summary: 
On July 23, 2019 at approximately 1:27 a.m., while making routine rounds inside the Special Housing Unit, staff 
observed inmate Epstein, Jeffrey Reg. No. MOM 
lying in the fetal position on the floor with a homemade 
fashioned noose around his neck. Inmate Epstein was breathing heavily, however appeared to be responsive. 
Inmate Epstein was directed by staff to stand and submit to restraints. Inmate Epstein would not stand on his own 
and would not comply with staff directives. Staff entered the cell and placed inmate Epstein in both hand and leg 
restraints. Inmate Epstein was searched, metal detected, placed on a gurney and escorted from the scene without 
further incident. Inmate Epstein was photographed, medically examined and determined to have sustained a circular 
line of erythema at the base of the neck and friction marks on the front of neck, and small 2cm erthema on left knee. 
Inmate Epstein was placed on suicide watch with all necessary notifications made. There were no staff injuries 
reported.

Possible Suicide Attempt 
On July 23, 2019 at approx. 1:27 a.m., a call for assistance on the Special Housing Unit 
was announced by the Control Center. Upon my arrival I was informed that an inmate 
had attempted suicide and roceeded to cell, Z05-124LAD. I observed inmate 
Epstein, Jeffrey 
lying in the fetal position on the floor of his cell wearing a 
t-shirt and boxers. He was breathing heavily and was snoring. I called out to inmate 
Epstein and observed him flicker his eyes and continue snoring. 
His neck was red 
with no abrasions. I observed no further injuries to his person. An attempt was made 
to get the inmate to stand on his own with negative results. The inmate was placed in 
hand restraints and staff was directed to retrieve the stretcher. As inmate Epstein was 
being placed on the stretcher by responding staff, he would open his eyes and observe 
staff. When staff made eye contact with him, he would hurriedly shut his eyes. The 
inmate was taken to HA-Unit, dressed in the suicide smock and placed on suicide 
watch. While awaiting the arrival of an inmate companion, inmate Epstein sat on the 
edge of the bed and began moving forward as if he was attempting to fall over head 
first. When I looked away, he straightened up. As I turned to look at him again, he 
attempted the same act. I laid him down on the bed and directed him to cease his 
action or he would be placed in restraints for his safety. At that moment, he stated, 
"Okay, I won't do it again," and gave the thumbs up. Because of his unpredictable 
behavior, the decision was made to have a staff member observe inmate Epstein. I 
left HA-Unit in order to make staff notifications. Moments later, I spoke with Officer 
R
who stated that inmate E stein was alert and had indicated that his cellmate, 
hone, Nicholas 
had attempted to kill him and had been harassing 
him. He stated that the inmate had indicated that he'd informed his attorney of this 
matter. 
I photographed and spoke with inmate Tartaglione, Nicholas 
who stated 
that he was asleep with his headphones on when he felt something ha his legs and 
said, "Jeff, what you're doing?" He didn't answer, so he got up, turned on the light and 
saw him with a string around his neck. He stated that he then called the guards and

they ran down. Upon fi....rier questioning, inmate Tartaglione ..sated that he sleeps on 
the bottom bunk, but gave it to inmate Epstein because he's old. He stated that he 
sleeps on the floor on a mattress. He stated that when he got up, he couldn't 
remember if he sat up or stood up to check on Epstein. He stated that Epstein was 
sitting on the floor leaning to the side with his eyes opened, but wasn't responding. He 
stated that the last time he saw him he was snoring really loud. 
Inmate Epstein stated that he came in from a legal visit at approx. 8:00PM and staff 
handed him a copy of the Daily News. "Nick" was on the floor reading the Daily News. 
He stated that he had given it to him. He stated that Tartaglione mentioned that he'd 
been in court all day in Westchester and was carrying on. At that point, inmate 
Tartaglione paused as if he was making the story up as he went along, and stated that 
Tartaglione stated, "These fucking niggers. This place is inhumane, I wish I could 
report it. I 
), that nigger hobbit mother fucker." He then turned to a page in 
the Daily News that had his picture on it and stated that Epstein was worth seventy 
seven million dollars. Epstein stated that he took his picture, balled it up and threw it in 
the garbage. I asked inmate Epstein what happened prior to staffs arrival. He stated 
that at approx. 1:00 AM, he'd gotten up to get a drink of water, as he gets up every 
thirty minutes. He remember walking back to his bunk and waking up with staff there 
in his cell. I asked if he'd waken up and seen staff, why didn't he respond when we 
were calling out to him? He stated that he only remembered hearing himself making a 
noise like snoring. When asked about the allegations against his cellmate, he stated 
that he was told, if he hurt him, staff wouldn't care. 
Duty medical, Dr. 
was notified and briefed. It was determined no further 
medical attention was needed. A medical assessment was not conducted at the time 
of this incident, due to the fact, there was no medical staff available after 10:00 PM. 
witill
U on the arrival of medical staff, inmate Epstein was examined and treated by, MLPI. 
for a circular line of erythema at the base of the neck, one section on the front 
marks of friction and a small erythema on his left knee.

Metropolitan Correctional Center 'accidentally released' serial bank robber days before Epstein's death 
Fox News 
By Nicole Darrah 
8/15/19 
A serial bank robber awaiting sentencing at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan was "accidentally 
released" from federal custody just days before a series of ignored protocols gave Jeffrey Epstein the opportunity 
for his apparent suicide. 
Michael Matthews, 58, was told Aug 7 he was free to leave the New York facility which, in recent days, has come 
under fire after Epstein, 66, died from an apparent suicide after being left alone in his cell for hours on Saturday —
despite recently being on suicide watch, and despite protocol requiring otherwise. 
Matthews' family told the New York Daily News that a counselor at MCC invited him to their office, where he was 
given a card to ride the subway and paperwork to sign to be released. lie knew he was awaiting sentencing, 
scheduled for Sept 20, but didn't speak up. 
Richard Donoghue, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, stated in a letter obtained by Fox News on 
Thursday that Matthews — who previously served time for bank robbery — was released, despite being held 
"pursuant to a permanent order of detention." 
EFTA00019402
--- PAGE 2 ---
He explains that Matthews was arrested in January after he failed to appear at a halfway house in Brooklyn after 
being released from a federal facility in New Jersey. He was charged with escaping custody, and was also charged in 
three bank robberies during the time he was supposed to be in the halfway house, according to prosecutors. 
"The government is currently seeking additional information about the circumstances prompting the defendant's 
pre-sentencing release, and sets forth below those facts that the government has confirmed to date," Donoghue 
wrote. 
While Matthews surrendered to officials Aug 12, his release further contributes to the scrutiny surrounding the 
MMC — which houses some of the highest-security inmates in the U.S. - 
following Epstein's death. 
Attorney General William Barr vowed on Monday a full investigation into the federal prison. He said he was 
"appalled... and frankly, angry to learn of MCC's failure to adequately secure this prisoner." 
"We are now learning of serious irregularities at this facility that are deeply concerning and demand a thorough 
investigation." 
Epstein, who was found with bruising on his neck in his cell last month, had been taken off suicide watch shortly 
before his death, according to a source familiar with the matter. Per protocol, the 66-year-old should've been 
checked on every 30 minutes, but before his death had not been physically checked on for "several hours." 
Additionally, he didn't have a cellmate on the night of his death. 
A lawyer for one of Epstein's former cellmates, Nicholas Tartaglione, a former police officer in New York who 
was charged in 2016 with the deaths of four men stemming from an alleged cocaine conspiracy, told Fox News 
earlier this week he's had several clients who have been locked up both in New York City's notorious Rikers Island 
jail and MCC, and claimed many have said they "would rather be at Bikers." 
"That gives you some idea how bad the place is," the lawyer, Bruce Barket said. "At the end of the day, the facility 
is run with a bad combination of laziness and cruelty and this is one of the results." 
He described conditions at MCC "border on inhumane," and said one day, when Tartaglione woke up, he 
discovered that while sleeping he'd rolled onto a rodent, smothering it. 
Separately, a representative from the American Federation of Government Employees/Council of Prison Locals 
decried the low staff levels at MCC, but also said the issue is a "system-wide crisis in our prison system."

Re: 
United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, 19-CRIM-00490 (S.D.N.Y.) 
Dear 
We represent Jeffrey Epstein, Reg No. 76318-054, who was previously 
incarcerated at the Metropolitan Correction Center in New York, New York (the "MCC") 
while awaiting trial on federal charges in the above-captioned case. We have been 
authorized by his estate to write pursuant to 28 C.F.R. §§ 16.21-16.26 to request 
documents and records from the U.S. Department of Justice related to Mr. Epstein. 
Specifically, we are seeking: any (i) protocols relating to the response 
to/investigation of inmate deaths within the MCC; (2) video recordings of all entrances 
and exits to the MCC; (3) entry and exit logs for the MCC; (4) video recordings of the 
hallways of the floor on which Mr. Epstein's cell was located; and (5) logs related to the 
guards on duty at the MCC (collectively, the "Requested Evidence"). The applicable 
time period for the requests is from 7:00 am on Friday, August 9, 2019 until 8:00 am on 
Saturday, August lo, 2019. As required by the regulations, we set forth below a 
summary of the relevance of the Requested Evidence. 
Mr. Epstein died in federal custody in his cell at the MCC. We are troubled by the 
circumstances of his death and by reports of irregularities at the facility. According to a 
statement issued by the Federal Bureau of Prisons: 
EFTA00019407
--- PAGE 2 ---
August 20, 2019 
Page 2 
On Saturday, August 10, 2019, at approximately 6:3o a.m., inmate Jeffrey 
Edward Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell in the Special Housing Unit 
from an apparent suicide at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New 
York, New York. Life-saving measures were initiated immediately by responding 
staff. Staff requested emergency medical services (EMS) and life-saving efforts 
continued. Mr. Epstein was transported by EMS to a local hospital for treatment 
of life-threatening injuries, and subsequently pronounced dead by hospital staff. 
The FBI is investigating the incident. 
In a separate statement, Attorney General William P. Barr indicated that "Mr. Epstein's 
death raises serious questions that must be answered." On August 12, Mr. Barr further 
stated, "We are now learning of serious irregularities at this facility that are deeply 
concerning and that demand a thorough investigation." 
Moreover, there was initial uncertainty about the cause and manner of Mr. 
Epstein's death. The New York City Office of Chief Medical Examiner ("OCME") 
declined to immediately release a determination, citing the need for "further 
information." Days later, the OCME announced that it had reached a conclusion 
following a "careful review of all investigative information." 
We intend to conduct our own investigation into the circumstances of Mr. 
Epstein's death. In order to do so, we ask that the Requested Evidence be made 
available to counsel. 
Please let us know if you would like to discuss this request.

Hey 
Here's an outline for our conversation with 
today. Of course you're in jury selection — it'd be great to get your 
thoughts before the call, but I think we can also just do it and talk after, or you can read as 
and I go through the 
introductory stuff. 
Thanks,

It is never too late for justice. Sometimes, you just have to have faith in the power of the truth and hope twelve jurors 
will do the right thing. At this trial, brave women will take the witness stand and the truth will come out: Ghislaine 
Maxwell sexually exploited underage girls. She caused unspeakable harm to vulnerable kids. It is time to hold her 
accountable. 
ill open in the morning. Please come support. Details below. Updates to follow. 
Main courtroom: 40 Foley, courtroom 318 
Overflow courtrooms: 110, 506, 905, and 906. There is also a conference room on the first floor (room 130) that has a 
very small monitor with a live feed just for our office. 
Timing: we'll start at 8:30 a.m. with peremptory challenges, and we expect to go straight to preliminary instructions and 
opening statements. In order to get a seat, we'd recommend that you go over early.

Per my previous email, if you are also interested in the summer Camp 1997 application and highschool school year 1999-
2000 application for the student in GX 742 just let me know and I can get those to you too. 
Let me know if you have any follow up questions, thanks.

General have reached an agreement in which the latter will promptly lift previously imposed liens to pay amounts 
owed for the Program and to begin funding the Program's active operations, including payment of compensation

Hi, I just called FedEx to confirm their last pick up time, and it is actually 4pm today since it is a weekend (I thought it 
was 6pm). Would it be possible for one of you to give defense counsel a call to ask if they want it sent via FedEx 
today? Would need to run it over to FedEx in like 10 minutes if so. So sorry for the firedrill, I thought since pick up 
was 6pm on the last few federal holidays it would be the same on Saturdays.

We have an additional discovery production ready to send to you. Attached please find the accompanying cover 
letter. That will be produced on a hard drive to you. In addition, a supplemental production of testifying witness and 
non-testifying witness material and exhibits are also ready to send to you. Attached please find the accompanying 
cover letter and indices. Those materials will be on the hard drive as well. We will also produce the testifying 
witness and non-testifying witness material and exhibits via USAfx. 
Please let us know if you would like to pick up the drive today or if you would like us to FedEx it (and if so, to where). 
Please let us know if you would like us to send today via FedEx a hard drive with these materials to Ms. Maxwell at 
the MDC or bring the hard drive to court on Tuesday.

Re: 
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
Dear Counsel: 
The Government expects to offer testimony from Computer Forensic Examiner 
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's ("FBI") Com uter Analysis Response Team 
("CART"). Although the Government believes that Examiner 
testimony will not require 
admission through Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, the Government nevertheless 
provides notice f Examiner 
anticipated testimony in an abundance of caution. A copy 
of Examiner 
curriculum vitae is being produced to you today bearing Bates number 3503-
001.' 
The Government anticipates that, if called as a witness, Examiner 
will testify about 
his extraction of devices seized pursuant to court-authorized search warrants; user information 
associated with certain of those devices; and documents and photographs extracted from certain 
' Examiner 
has previously testified regarding similar topics in federal court. As a courtesy, 
the Government notifies you that Examiner 
has previously testified in federal court in 
United States v. DiTomasso, 14 Cr. 160 (SAS), United States v. Hirst, 15 Cr. 643 (PKC), United 
States v. Stash', 18 Cr. 259 (PKC), and United States v. Kelly, 19 Cr. 286 (AMD) (E.D.N.Y.). 
EFTA00019459
--- PAGE 2 ---
Page 2 
of those devices. The Government further anticipates that Examiner 
will also testify that 
some of the devices on which he performed extractions were clones of device extractions that had 
previously been performed by someone else. 
The Government reserves the right to call additional expert witnesses and will promptly 
provide notice if the Government elects to do so. 
Request for Reciprocal Discovery and Expert Notice 
The Government reiterates its April 23, 2021 request for reciprocal notice under Rule 
16(b)(1)(C) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure regarding any expert witness that the 
defendant intends to rely upon, including a written summary of any testimony that the defendant 
intends to use under Rules 702, 703, or 705 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, as well as the 
witness's qualifications. 
Additionally, the Government reiterates its August 5, 2020 request for reciprocal discovery 
under Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(b). Specifically, we request that you allow inspection and copying of: 
(1) any books, papers, documents, data, photographs, tangible objects, buildings or places, or 
copies or portions thereof, which are in the defendant's possession, custody or control, and which 
the defendant intends to introduce as evidence or otherwise rely on at trial; and (2) any results or 
reports of physical or mental examinations and of scientific tests or experiments made in 
connection with this case, or copies thereof, which are in the defendant's possession or control, 
and which the defendant intends to introduce as evidence or otherwise rely on at trial or which 
were prepared by a witness whom the defendant intends to call at trial. 
The Government also reiterates its August 5, 2020 request that the defendant disclose prior 
statements of witnesses she will call to testify, including expert witnesses. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 
26.2; United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225 (1975).

In order meet the demand for the high volume of media requests we are already receiving, the following guidance is 
being provided in advance of the trial to ensure efficient communications. Please take careful note. 
UNITED STATES ATTORNEY'S OFFICE 
Southern District of New York 
PRESS GUIDANCE 
Friday, November 26, 2021 
*OFF-THE-RECORD,  AND FOR GUIDANCE ONLY: Several of the government's anticipated witnesses will be testifying in 
this trial using a pseudonym or first name. The Court granted a Government motion (attached) requesting that they 
be able to do so, because the victim witnesses are expected to describe alleged sensitive, explicit and personal events 
concerning illegal sexual abuse, sexual contact and other acts of which they have been victims. I believe most, if not 
all, news media outlets have a policy against identifying sex crime victims without their consent, and urge you to 
abide by that policy with our witnesses and respect their privacy. 
9:30 a.m. — Final pretrial conference U.S. v. Ghislaine Maxwell — the defendant is charged in connection to conspiring 
with Jeffrey Epstein to entice minors to travel to engage in criminal sexual activity — before Judge Alison Nathan 
(Courtroom 318, 40 Foley Square (overflow Courtrooms 110, 506, 905, and 906 of the Thurgood Marshall U.S. 
Courthouse]). 
EXHIBITS: Government exhibits will be provided exclusively through the SDNY file share. If you are unable to access 
this link to the file share (USAFx), you must establish an account to access the files. To establish an account, request 
access by email to me or my colleague, Jim Margolin, Cc'd here, prior to Wednesday, November 29, 2021. 
Please also note that all case filings in U.S. v. Maxwell are available in the Court's electronic filing system; we encourage 
media representatives to establish a free PACER account, if they have not done so already. Credentialing and other 
matters relating to in-person attendance for the trial are handled by the SDNY District Executive's Office.

Here is a draft letter to the Court. I'm going to send to the chiefs in 10 minutes so please let me know if you have any 
edits. 
Subject: RE: Meet and Confer 
Judge Nathan agreed with us that sections of the deposition transcripts that appear unredacted in the publicly filed 
indictment should still be redacted in your opposition because they were sealed in the defamation case. The redactions 
we are proposing refer to those sections. So the fact that the language appears in the indictment does not mean it should 
not be redacted. 
That said, to move this along, we will preserve this objection and raise it with the Court at a later time, if we choose to. 
However, we do ask that you redact "[Minor Victim-2]" at the bottom of page 134 so that it is consistent with the 
redactions ordered by Judge Nathan on the top of the same page. 
Thanks, 
Chris 
r 
Chris, 
We have confirmed that our proposed redactions to Exhibit 11 and those you circulated to Exhibit 11 are the same. As to 
your newly proposed redactions, we understand that you are requesting that we redact portions of our brief that either 
quote or generally refer to unredacted portions of your publicly filed opening brief (Dkt. 136 at pages 14 to 17) or 
language contained in the publicly filed indictment. We don't understand why you are requesting that this language now 
be sealed. Can you please explain your position? 
EFTA00019474
--- PAGE 2 ---
Thanks, 
Subject: RE: Meet and Confer 
■ 
I believe we agree on the redactions to Exhibit 11. I have attached our proposed redacted version of Exhibit 11. I have 
checked it against yours and I believe they track exactly, but maybe you could double check. We also agree that no 
redactions to the cover letter are necessary. We also confirm that you should keep the redactions on pp. 118-119. 
We also noticed that on pages 130-134 of the opposition brief there are a few quotations and other references to 
testimony in the civil case that are still sealed. In light of Judge Nathan's order, we think those should be redacted as 
well. We have attached the relevant pages. The additional redactions are noted in red boxes. 
Please let me know if you want to discuss further. 
Thanks, 
Chris 
Subject: RE: Meet and Confer 
Chris, 
Thanks for your email. In accordance with Judge Nathan's order, we are writing to confer regarding Exhibit 11 and your 
cover letter dated March 9, 2021. Attached please find proposed redactions to Exhibit 11. We do not believe any 
redactions are necessary to your cover letter. 
We intend to the file the brief with the redactions as set forth in Judge Nathan's March 18, 2021 order, attached here for 
your convenience. We note that the redactions contained on pages 118 to 119 redact quotations from and references to 
a document that you filed under seal (Exhibit H). We understand that the quoted portions of that document are also 
under seal on the civil docket before Judge Preska. Given those facts, we wanted to double check with you to see 
whether you in fact want those redactions removed. We will defer to you on whether these should be redacted. 
Best,

Hey= and 
Here is correspondence (with attachments) about the OPR investigating. On December 10, 2010, I asked U.S. Attorney 
Ferrer (S.D. Fla.) to investigate the "most suspicious criminal case I have ever encountered." That letter was forwarded to 
OPR and, on May 6, 2011, OPR declined to investigate on grounds of ongoing litigation. 
Note: We have seen a privilege log from S.D. Fla. that makes it appear that there was some correspondence between OPR 
at Main Justice and S.D. Florida in connection with my letter. That correspondence was deemed "privileged" in some way, 
so we've never seen it. But you should be able to get it. 
Of course, as you know, in about January 2019, OPR did open an investigation into the case ... prompting my February 7, 
2019 letter (attached) requesting that the victims be kept informed. I've received a response and we're going to set up a 
conference call soon.

Hi = 
— Just a heads up that the Maxwell team is going to seek your approval this morning to issue a friendly 
subpoena to counsel for Minor Victim-4, the latest victim whose abuse gives rise to the superseder, for a non-privileged 
materials related to her settlement with Epstein back in 2008 or thereabouts. As you can imagine, we think we need this 
stuff both to prepare for trial but also as potential Giglio for the witness, and her lawyer is happy to provide it to us but 
believes he needs a subpoena. 
Happy to chat further if that would be helpful, but otherwise will have the team send you an email shortly so you can 
approve.

Sorry about the delay. Interlochen doesn't have any other documents regarding tuition payment information or

Let me know if you have any other questions.

Hi Maurene — 
I'm happy to have a call. I'm available Monday all morning, Tuesday until 10:30am and Wednesday all morning. 
I apologize about not getting back with you. I thought the other attorney that filed the response was going to do so. 
Regardless, the response included everything that Interlochen has. They only keep tuition payment information for 7 
years and nothing in their files reflects any payments by Epstein or Epstein entities.

I' 
Thank you both very much for your assistance in response to our subpoenas seeking records from Interlochen. In 
reviewing the documents you produced in response to the attached subpoena, a follow-up question arose. Would 
you please confirm that your production included all records of any tuition payments that Epstein (or his entities) 
made for any students at Interlochen? 
Our team is also happy to discuss this inquiry over the phone if that would be useful. I am starting a trial tomorrow 
and will have limited availability this week, but my colleagues 
and

able to coordinate with you as needed.

In addition, could you please run database searches on 301 E. 66th Street? This is the address for a property

We'd like the PDF files in the folder uploaded but NOT the files in the subfolder (titled "Files combined and manifest"). 
We also expect to be receiving a large amount of case files in the coming weeks, and so want to get up and running, 
including agent access, so there's no delay once we receive the large batch of documents. 
With respect to anticipate review process, it's possible that at some point we might receive materials that would 
necessitate a privilege review, but not at this stage and not with respect to the materials in the linked folder. 
Please let me know if any other information would be helpful, and thanks very much.

Department of Justice 
Information Technology (IT) Security 
Rules of Behavior (ROB) for General Users 
Version 7.0 
January 3, 2014 
I. Introduction 
The Rules of Behavior (ROB) for General Users pertain to the use, security, and acceptable level of risk 
for Department of Justice (DOJ) systems. The rules highlight that taking personal responsibility for the 
security of an information system and its data is an essential part of your job. As a user of the DOJ 
Information Technology (IT) data and systems, you are the first line of defense in support of DOJ's IT 
security. 
The intent of the ROB is to acknowledge users' receipt and understanding of applicable IT security 
requirements from various Federal and DOJ policies and procedures. These requirements include, but 
are not limited to, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-130, OMB M-07-16, OMB 
M-05-08, the Privacy Act of 1974, DOJ Order 2640.2 (series), DOJ Order 2740.1 (series), and the DOJ 
IT Security Standard. 
Who is covered by these rules? 
These rules apply to all personnel (government employees and contractors) who perform general non-
privileged duties on DOJ information systems, access or use DOJ information, or provide IT services 
to DOJ — hereafter referred to as users. All users are required to review and provide signature or 
electronic verification acknowledging compliance with these rules to their respective Component IT 
Security representative. 
Certain authorized personnel may obtain limited exemptions for specific occurrences when performing 
official duties. These individuals must document situations where equipment and software limitations 
listed below prevent mission operations. In addition to this ROB, the user shall also agree to and 
provide signature or electronic verification acknowledging compliance for the Privileged User ROB. 
The system Authorizing Official (AO) will issue an exemption if the accepted risk(s) and justification 
is documented and appropriate'. 
What are the penalties for noncompliance? 
Non-compliance with requirements will be enforced through sanctions commensurate with the level of 
infraction. Actions may include a verbal or written warning, temporary suspension of system access or 
permanent revocation, reassignment to other duties, or termination, depending on the severity of the 
violation. In addition, activities that lead to or cause disclosure of classified information may result in 
criminal prosecution under the U.S. Code, Title 18, Section 798, and other applicable statutes. 
Unauthorized browsing or inspection of Federal Taxpayer Information (Internal Revenue Code Sec. 
7213A) is punishable with a fine of up to $1,000 and/or up to one year imprisonment. Unauthorized 
disclosure of Tax Return information (Internal Revenue Code Sec. 7213) is a felony punishable with a 
fine of up to $5,000 and up to five years in prison. In addition to these penalties, any Federal employee 
convicted under Sec. 7213 or Sec.7213A will be dismissed from employment. 
I For additional information on mobile device exemptions, please refer to the Department of Justice Mobile Device and Mobile 
Application Security Policy Instruction v2 (http://dojnet.doj.gov0md/irm/itsecurity/documents/FINAL-

including DOJ Orders and Standards. Use DOJ information and information systems for lawful, 
official use, and authorized purposes only. 
2. Do not generate, download, store, copy, or transmit offensive or inappropriate information 
in any medium, to include e-mail messages, documents, images, videos, and sound files. 
3. Limit distribution of e-mail to only those with a "need to know." 
4. Do not open e-mails from suspicious sources (e.g., people you don't recognize, know, or 
normally communicate with) and do not visit untrusted or inappropriate websites (unless 
authorized). Only download permissible files from known and reliable sources and use virus-
checking procedures prior to file use. 
5. Protect and safeguard all DOJ information, including personally identifiable information 
(PII), commensurate with the sensitivity and value of the data at risk. Protect and safeguard 
all DOJ information and information systems from unauthorized access, unauthorized or 
inadvertent modification, disclosure, damage, destruction, loss, theft, denial of service, 
improper sanitization, and improper use. 
6. Verify that each computer-readable data extract containing sensitive PII data has been erased 
within 90 days of origination or that its use is still required. 
7. Upon discovery of a known or suspected security incident, report the incident to your Help Desk, 
Incident Response Representative, Justice Security Operations Center, Security Manager, or 
Supervisor. 
8. Immediately report lost or stolen devices (e.g., laptop, phone, tablet, thumb drive) to your Help 
Desk, Incident Response Representative, Justice Security Operations Center, Security Manager, 
or Supervisor. 
9. Encrypt all DOJ Sensitive but Unclassified (SBU) data on authorized mobile computers, laptops, 
tablets, and removable media (e.g., removable hard drives, thumb drives, and DVDs) using 
Department-approved solutions unless a waiver or policy exemption exists. For classified 
environments, follow the procedures required for those networks for data storage and transport. 
All data is considered sensitive unless designated as non-sensitive by the Component

roles, and functions within a system or application (e.g., duties of the System Administrator 
and Information System Security Officer (ISSO) should not be combined). 
19. Do not change any configurations or settings of the operating system and security-related 
software, or circumvent and test the security controls of the system unless authorized. 
20. Do not bypass native mobile device operating system controls to gain increased privileges (i.e.,

conspiracy to commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. The Indictment 
unsealed today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 through 1997, MAXWELL and co-conspirator 
Jeffrey Epstein exploited girls as young as 14, including by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the 
purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference for young girls,

MAXWELL played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations 
including New York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, MAXWELL made several false 
statements in sworn depositions in 2016. MAXWELL is expected to be presented this afternoon in the in federal 
court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan. 
Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated, aided, and 
participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then 
delivered them into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust. 
All the while, she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself. 
Today, after many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the 
most important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the 
law and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth into 
behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the quest for 
justice has been met with great disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. The 
example set by the women involved has been a powerful one. They persevered against the rich and connected, 
and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a subpoena - and they stood together. I have no doubt the bravery 
exhibited by the women involved here has empowered others to speak up about the crimes of which they've been 
subjected." 
NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said: "The heinous crimes these charges allege are, and always will 
be abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement 
partners, for their continuing commitment to bringing justice to the survivors of sexual assault, everywhere." 
If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, please contact 
the FBI at 1-800-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
According to the Indictment[ I I unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated 
in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, 
which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies or 
taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at 
ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. 
Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to accept offers of 
financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. MAXWELL also 
normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, encouraging them to massage 
Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and 
susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between 
minor victims and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL 
was present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages 
during which a minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein 
involving a minor victim where MAXWELL was present. 
EFTA00019538
--- PAGE 3 ---
As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching 
of a victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to 
touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and 
Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as 
well as MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal 
sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to 
travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of 
transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, which carries a maximum sentence of 
years in prison, one count of conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual 
activity, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and two counts of perjury, each of which 
carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
The statutory maximum penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational 
purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be determined by the judge. 
Ms. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and the NYPD. 
This case is being handled by the Office's Public Corruption Unit. Assistant U.S. Attorneys 
and 
are in charge of the prosecution. 
The charges contained in the Indictment are merely accusations. The defendant is presumed innocent 
unless and until proven guilty.

Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal 
sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to 
travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of 
transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, which carries a maximum sentence of 
years in prison, one count of conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual 
activity, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and two counts of perjury, each of which 
carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
The statutory maximum penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational 
purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be determined by the judge. 
Ms. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and the NYPD. 
This case is being handled by the Office's Public Corruption Unit. Assistant U.S. Attorneys 
and 
are in charge of the prosecution. 
The charges contained in the Indictment are merely accusations. The defendant is presumed innocent 
unless and until proven guilty.

Hi =, 
(USANYS) 
Wanted to quickly check in to follow up on our conversations last week and earlier this week — I think you were able to 
transmit the scanned records to S 
but I'm not sure whether that was just the 16,000 pages you mentioned when we 
last spoke, or if you were able to get all 29,000 to her? And we're also hoping to confirm for sure that all the materials 
you received were definitely scanned in, and to get an index or catalog of those materials (including what media was 
included). 
Another person on our team, 
who's copied, is jumping in to coordinate on this, so if it's easier to chat via 
phone her number is 
and please let us know if anything would be helpful on our end. 
thanks again!

Hey—can we update the Epstein Universe with victim attorney information? I can't tell if that's already done, because the 
doc is checked out, but it's hard to keep them straight otherwise, and I don't want to go by memory/emails, because the 
volume of witnesses is just going to be really high. Thanks.

Hi 
In connection with this trip, could you please assist with booking the following travel? Thanks! 
• 
Hotel—same as last time, the DoubleTree in Santa Monica is fine. Checking in 12/15, checking out the next day 
• 
We do not need a conference room 
• 
Outbound flight: Sunday, 12/15, departing JFK at 11:40 am on Delta, landing at LAX at 3:01 p.m. 
• 
Inbound flight: Monday, 12/16, departing LAX at 8:32 p.m. on JetBlue, landing at JFK at 4:47 a.m. 
• 
If you could please make all flights refundable, that would be great — it's possible we'll need to rebook parts of 
this if witness availability changes or we're able to stay longer and meet with an additional witness. 
Thanks a bunch.

Again in connection with the Epstein investigation, we'd like to please request permission to travel for approximately 
three days next week for meetings and interviews in West Palm Beach, Florida. As of now we tentatively expect to fly

Unfortunately we're still trying to pin down timing for interviewing the victims, so depending on the timing it will either 
be me and

This is helpful and interesting, thanks very much for sending. Among other things, notable that Judge Failla assumes, even 
were punitive damages to be excluded, a claim "for millions upon millions of dollars." 
Separately, Robbie, I noticed near the end of the conference you mentioned, at p. 27, that: "They [the estate and/or the 
trustees?1 have identified the sole beneficiary as Mr. Epstein's brother." I'm wondering if you might have a recollection of 
what the estate has said or represented to you about that? And if you recall whether any discussion of beneficiaries was 
in connection with the will versus the trust versus the estate, etc. Just if you feel comfortable sharing any of that 
information, of course—no obligation at all. And if it's more convenient to relay in real time, rather than drafting up an 
email, please don't hesitate to give a call. No emergency or rush, but did want to ask.

know the issue. The TDY needs to be changed to Santa Monica, CA instead of Los Angeles, CA since you're 
actually staying in a hotel that's in Santa Monica, CA, which has a per diem of $248. Los Angeles, CA has a per diem of 
$181 only. I'll make the amendments and resend your Travel Authorization to Budget ASAP.

Roberta, 
I wanted to let you know that Ken, Camille and I have prepared a Draft Protocol for the Program, setting forth 
the proposed criteria and requirements for the evaluation of claims, and the claims process. As you know, the 
establishment of the Program is still pending approval by the Superior Court of the U.S. Virgin Islands. However, 
we felt that it was important for us to move forward on the proposed design of the Program and to engage you 
in the process as soon as possible. 
To that end, we have attached a copy of the Draft Protocol, for your review and consideration. We welcome an 
opportunity to meet with you to discuss any comments you may have. The comment period will run through 
January 31, 2020. 
Whenever you have a chance, please let us know if you are available to meet on any of the following dates: 
December 18, January 6, 7, 8, 10, and 16. If none of those dates work, please provide alternate dates and 
times, and we will try to coordinate schedules and set something up. 
Looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
Regards, 
Jordy, Ken and Camille

On behalf of Roberta Kaplan 
Jordy, 
Thank you for your email. We appreciate your commitment to a program that is independent of the Estate, which we also 
view as a central feature of any viable alternative to litigation. As I'm sure you can understand, however, a claims 
resolution program in which the three decision-makers were selected and hired by the Estate—and, we presume, are 
being paid by the Estate—cannot be said to be independent. In our view, there is a straightforward solution to this 
otherwise intractable problem: the program should add a fourth administrator, selected by plaintiffs, and require that all 
claims decisions are rendered unanimously.

We look forward to discussing this proposal with you. We suggest arranging a time to do so before the protocol is 
finalized, since it will be important to incorporate the input of an additional administrator into that process. We will, of 
course, also raise this with the Estate.

Thank you for your email. I hear your concerns and want to reiterate that this proposed Program is entirely voluntary and 
independent of the Estate. It in no way imposes a process or outcome on the victims, and will in no way be administered 
or controlled by the Estate. Those are signature features of the Program. 
As I mentioned in my email last week, Ken, Camille and I are in the process of drafting a claims protocol and plan to 
circulate it - in draft form — to you and your counterparts before the holidays, and welcome any input you may have at 
that time. We will provide ample time for you to review and respond to the draft protocol, and will be happy and 
available to discuss your comments before the protocol is finalized. 
We look forward to speaking with you. 
Regards, 
Jordy

Thank you for reaching out to us. We are writing back on behalf of (and copying) certain plaintiffs' counsel who 
appeared at an SDNY conference last week for sexual abuse survivors of Epstein. We intend no disrespect to 
you and your colleagues, but, candidly, we have serious concerns about the Estate's purported decision to 
impose a non-binding settlement process on our clients unilaterally. All of these women still struggle today 
because of the profound manipulation, objectification, and physical abuse to which Jeffrey Epstein subjected 
each of them. Regardless of your own significant experience and good intentions, the fact that the Estate chose 
an administrator without any participation, input, or consideration of our clients' views or wishes is 
disconcerting, particularly given the personal nature of the claims at issue. 
We are, of course, interested above all in advancing our clients' interests. As you may know, at a status 
conference last week in the Southern District, Magistrate Judge Freeman instructed counsel for the Estate and 
counsel for plaintiffs to engage in good faith discussions about any proposed claim resolution program. We 
have already directed a request for information on the proposed program to Bennet Moskowitz, and look 
forward to his response and to a productive dialogue with counsel ahead of the Jan. 10, 2019 deadline set by 
the Magistrate for an update on the status of our negotiations. Assuming that our settlement discussions with 
Defendants progress, we look forward to working with you at the appropriate time to design an effective and 
appropriate settlement program.

Subject: Epstein Victims' Compensation Program 
Roberta, 
As you know, I will be serving as co-Designer, along with Ken Feinberg and Camille Biros, and Administrator of 
the proposed Epstein Victims' Compensation Program. I wanted to reach out to you to introduce myself, as I 
understand that you represent victims who have asserted, or may assert, claims of sexual abuse against Jeffrey 
Epstein or his Estate. I also wanted to reinforce the key guiding principles of the Program and give you a sense 
of timing in the near term. 
This proposed Program is purely voluntary, non-adversarial and entirely independent of the Estate. The Estate 
will have no authority whatsoever to interfere with the administration of the Program or the evaluation of 
individual claims. 
Ken, Camille and I are in the process of drafting a proposed protocol - setting forth the proposed terms, 
conditions, and criteria that will govern the Program - and plan to circulate a draft protocol before the end of 
the year. We will be seeking your input at that time in whatever format you would like to provide it, through a 
meeting with us and/or written comments, before the protocol is finalized. 
We look forward to serving these deserving victims. 
Regards, 
EFTA00019568
