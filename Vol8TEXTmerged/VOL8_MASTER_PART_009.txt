UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 
Defendant. 
X 
SEALED 
INDICTMENT 
Cr. 
Cr. 330 
COUNT ONE 
(Conspiracy to Entice Minors to Travel to Engage in 
Illegal Sex Acts) 
The Grand Jury charges: 
OVERVIEW 
1. 
The charges set forth herein stem from the role 
of GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, in the sexual exploitation 
and abuse of multiple minor girls by Jeffrey Epstein. In 
particular, from at least in or about 1994, up to and including 
at least in or about 1997, MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and 
contributed to Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among 
other things, helping Epstein to recruit, groom, and ultimately 
abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age 
of 18. The victims were as young as 14 years old when they were 
groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
that certain victims were in fact under the age of 18. 
2. 
As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to 
abuse minor victims, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, and 
Jeffrey Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to 
EFTA00024594
--- PAGE 2 ---
Epstein's residences in different states, which MAXWELL knew and 
intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to 
sexual abuse. Moreover, in an effort to conceal her crimes, 
MAXWELL repeatedly lied when questioned about her conduct, 
including in relation to some of the minor victims described 
herein, when providing testimony under oath in 2016. 
FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
3. 
During the time periods charged in this 
Indictment, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, had a personal and 
professional relationship with Jeffrey Epstein and was among his 
closest associates. In particular, between in or about 1994 and 
in or about 1997, MAXWELL was in an intimate relationship with 
Epstein and also was paid by Epstein to manage his various 
properties. Over the course of their relationship, MAXWELL and 
Epstein were photographed together on multiple occasions, 
including in the below image: 
EFTA00024595
--- PAGE 3 ---
4. 
Beginning in at least 1994, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 
the defendant, enticed and groomed multiple minor girls to 
engage in sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein, through a variety of 
means and methods, including but not limited to the following: 
a. 
MAXWELL first attempted to befriend some of 
Epstein's minor victims prior to their abuse, including by 
asking the victims about their lives, their schools, and their 
families. MAXWELL and Epstein would spend time building 
friendships with minor victims by, for example, taking minor 
victims to the movies or shopping. Some of these outings would 
involve MAXWELL and Epstein spending time together with a minor 
victim, while some would involve MAXWELL or Epstein spending 
time alone with a minor victim. 
b. 
Having developed a rapport with a victim, 
MAXWELL would try to normalize sexual abuse for a minor victim 
by, among other things, discussing sexual topics, undressing in 
front of the victim, being present when a minor victim was 
undressed, and/or being present for sex acts involving the minor 
victim and Epstein. 
c. 
MAXWELL'S presence during minor victims' 
interactions with Epstein, including interactions where the 
minor victim was undressed or that involved sex acts with 
Epstein, helped put the victims at ease because an adult woman 
was present. For example, in some instances, MAXWELL would 
EFTA00024596
--- PAGE 4 ---
massage Epstein in front of a minor victim. In other instances, 
MAXWELL encouraged minor victims to provide massages to Epstein, 
including sexualized massages during which a minor victim would 
be fully or partially nude. Many of those massages resulted in 
Epstein sexually abusing the minor victims. 
d. 
In addition, Epstein offered to help some 
minor victims by paying for travel and/or educational 
opportunities, and MAXWELL encouraged certain victims to accept 
Epstein's assistance. As a result, victims were made to feel 
indebted and believed that MAXWELL and Epstein were trying to 
help them. 
e. 
Through this process, MAXWELL and Epstein 
enticed victims to engage in sexual activity with Epstein. In 
some instances, MAXWELL was present for and participated in the 
sexual abuse of minor victims. Some such incidents occurred in 
the context of massages, which developed into sexual encounters. 
5. 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, facilitated 
Jeffrey Epstein's access to minor victims knowing that he had a 
sexual preference for underage girls and that he intended to 
engage in sexual activity with those victims. Epstein's 
resulting abuse of minor victims included, among other things, 
touching a victim's breast, touching a victim's genitals, 
placing a sex toy such as a vibrator on a victim's genitals, 
EFTA00024597
--- PAGE 5 ---
directing a victim to touch Epstein while he masturbated, and 
directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. 
MAXWELL AND EPSTEIN'S VICTIMS 
6. 
Between approximately in or about 1994 and in or 
about 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, facilitated 
Jeffrey Epstein's access to minor victims by, among other 
things, inducing and enticing, and aiding and abetting the 
inducement and enticement of, multiple minor victims. Victims 
were groomed and/or abused at multiple locations, including the 
following: 
a. 
A a multi-story private residence on the 
Upper East Side of Manhattan, New York owned by Epstein (the 
"New York Residence"), which is depicted in the following 
photograph: 
EFTA00024598
--- PAGE 6 ---
b. 
An estate in Palm Beach, Florida owned by 
Epstein (the "Palm Beach Residence"), which is depicted in the 
following photograph: 
c. 
A ranch in Santa Fe, New Mexico owned by 
Epstein (the "New Mexico Residence"), which is depicted in the 
following photograph: 
EFTA00024599
--- PAGE 7 ---
d. 
MAXWELL's personal residence in London, 
England. 
7. 
Among the victims induced or enticed by GHISLAINE 
MAXWELL, the defendant, were minor victims identified herein as 
Minor Victim-1, Minor Victim-2, and Minor Victim-3. In 
particular, and during time periods relevant to this Indictment, 
MAXWELL engaged in the following acts, among others, with 
respect to minor victims: 
a. 
MAXWELL met Minor Victim-1 when Minor 
Victim-1 was approximately 14 years old. MAXWELL subsequently 
interacted with Minor Victim-1 on multiple occasions at 
Epstein's residences, knowing that Minor Victim-1 was under the 
age of 18 at the time. During these interactions, which took 
place between approximately 1994 and 1997, MAXWELL groomed Minor 
Victim-1 to engage in sexual acts with Epstein through multiple 
means. First, MAXWELL and Epstein attempted to befriend Minor 
Victim-1, taking her to the movies and on shopping trips. 
MAXWELL also asked Minor Victim-1 about school, her classes, her 
family, and other aspects of her life. MAXWELL then sought to 
normalize inappropriate and abusive conduct by, among other 
things, undressing in front of Minor Victim-1 and being present 
when Minor Victim-1 undressed ih front of Epstein. Within the 
first year after MAXWELL and Epstein met Minor Victim-1, Epstein 
began sexually abusing Minor Victim-1. MAXWELL was present for 
EFTA00024600
--- PAGE 8 ---
and involved in some of this abuse. In particular, MAXWELL 
involved Minor Victim-1 in group sexualized massages of Epstein. 
During those group sexualized massages, MAXWELL and/or Minor 
Victim-1 would engage in sex acts with Epstein. Epstein and 
MAXWELL both encouraged Minor Victim-1 to travel to Epstein's 
residences in both New York and Florida. As a result, Minor 
Victim-1 was sexually abused by Epstein in both New York and 
Florida. Minor Victim-1 was enticed to travel across state 
lines for the purpose of sexual encounters with Epstein, and 
MAXWELL was aware that Epstein engaged in sexual activity with 
Minor Victim-1 after Minor-Victim-1 traveled to Epstein's 
properties, including in the context of a sexualized massage. 
b. 
MAXWELL interacted with Minor Victim-2 on at 
least one occasion in or about 1996 at Epstein's residence in 
New Mexico when Minor Victim-2 was under the age of 18. Minor 
Victim-2 had flown into New Mexico from out of state at 
Epstein's invitation for the purpose of being groomed for and/or 
subjected to acts of sexual abuse. MAXWELL knew that Minor 
Victim-2 was under the age of 18 at the time. While in New 
Mexico, MAXWELL and Epstein took Minor Victim-2 to a movie and 
MAXWELL took Minor Victim-2 shopping. MAXWELL also discussed 
Minor Victim-2's school, classes, and family with Minor Victim-
2. In New Mexico, MAXWELL began her efforts to groom Minor 
Victim-2 for abuse by Epstein by, among other things, providing 
EFTA00024601
--- PAGE 9 ---
an unsolicited massage to Minor Victim-2, during which Minor 
Victim-2 was topless. MAXWELL also encouraged Minor Victim-2 to 
massage Epstein. 
c. 
MAXWELL groomed and befriended Minor 
Victim-3 in London, England between approximately 1994 and 1995, 
including during a period of time in which MAXWELL knew that 
Minor Victim-3 was under the age of 18. Among other things, 
MAXWELL discussed Minor Victim-3's life and family with Minor 
Victim-3. MAXWELL introduced Minor Victim-3 to Epstein and 
arranged for multiple interactions between Minor Victim-3 and 
Epstein. During those interactions, MAXWELL encouraged Minor 
Victim-3 to massage Epstein, knowing that Epstein would engage 
in sex acts with Minor Victim-3 during those massages. Minor 
Victim-3 provided Epstein with the requested massages, and 
during those massages, Epstein sexually abused Minor Victim-3. 
MAXWELL was aware that Epstein engaged in sexual activity with 
Minor Victim-3 on multiple occasions, including at times when 
Minor Victim-3 was under the age of 18, including in the context 
of a sexualized massage. 
MAXWELL'S EFFORTS TO CONCEAL HER CONDUCT 
8. 
In or around 2016, in the context of a deposition 
as part of civil litigation, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, 
repeatedly provided false and perjurious statements, under oath, 
regarding, among other subjects, her role in facilitating the

Good afternoon-

In our 4/22 letter, we provided specific details concerning cases and trial dates 
to justify our request for a continuance to 11/8. 
Beyond a vague statement regarding consideration of availability of witnesses and counsel, 
you have provided no specific details why the government cannot proceed to trial on 11/8. 
Starting the trial on 11/29 - besides disrupting Thanksgiving holiday plans - will push the trial 
to the end of the year and possibly into the new year, interfering with Christmas and 
New Year's plans, as COVID did last year. This will cast the defense and defense case 
in a negative light as jurors impatiently wait for the trial to conclude before Christmas, which it won't. 
Our previous email explained our reasons for firmly pressing the 11/8 trial date, 
but as an accommodation, we would consider starting on 11/15, but no later. 
For now, we will not agree to exclusion of speedy trial time beyond 11/8. 
These scheduling conflicts can be easily eliminated by consenting to bail for Ms. Maxwell. 
It is unclear why the scheduling order, which contemplated a continuance, should be altered. 
As previously discussed and raised with the Court, we need to review of 3500 material 
and exhibits before determining the need to call any experts. 
Enjoy the day.

Bobbi, 
Thanks very much for letting us know your availability. Regarding the trial date, after considering the availability of 
witnesses and counsel, we plan to propose a trial date of November 29, 2021. Could you please let us know your 
position regarding that date, so that we can include it in our letter to the Court? In addition, please let us know 
whether you consent to an exclusion of time under the Speedy Trial Act between now and the new trial date the 
Court selects. 
With respect to other scheduling matters, we intend to propose that the Court set a deadline of three months before 
trial for the Government to disclose the identities of victims referenced in the indictment; this is an earlier proposal 
than the timeframe we had originally proposed for the July trial date. We also intend to propose that the deadline 
for defense expert disclosures be set for two months before trial, given the substantial length of the adjournment. 
Please let us know your position regarding those proposed dates and we'll include it in our letter. 
Thanks very much, and hope everyone has a nice weekend--

Good afternoon-
For the reasons stated in our letter-motion of 4/22 (Dkt. 246), 
our earliest and preferred date in the fall is 11/8. 
In light of Ms. Maxwell's extended period of detention 
and its deleterious effect on her health and well-being, 
we cannot agree to a date far beyond 11/8. 
However, should you agree to her release pending trial, 
we would have greater date flexibility.

Date: Wed, 12 May 2021 01:04:17 +0000 
Today I spoke with Katya Jestin. Katya had previously indicated that she represents a wealthy, anonymous client who 
wishes to provide financial assistance to victims of Jeffrey Epstein. Katya had asked whether our office could connect her 
with attorneys who represent Epstein victims. Previously, I had told Katya I would get back to her. 
During today's call, I indicated that our team could not and would not play any role in connecting Katya's client with

Just confirming receipt. Also, I'm hopeful that we can have everything gathered by April 12th. However, I'll be out of the 
office for the next week so it might be delayed. Will that be a problem? 
In addition, and just for confirmation's sake, you are ok that we will make reasonable efforts to notify the 
parents/students of the subpoena prior to compliance with the subpoena correct?

Hi Maurene — 
I'm happy to have a call. I'm available Monday all morning, Tuesday until 10:30am and Wednesday all morning. 
I apologize about not getting back with you. I thought the other attorney that filed the response was going to do so. 
Regardless, the response included everything that Interlochen has. They only keep tuition payment information for 7 
years and nothing in their files reflects any payments by Epstein or Epstein entities.

Jeff and George, 
Thank you both very much for your assistance in response to our subpoenas seeking records from Interlochen. In 
reviewing the documents you produced in response to the attached subpoena, a follow-up question arose. Would 
you please confirm that your production included all records of any tuition payments that Epstein (or his entities) 
made for any students at Interlochen?

Joe, 
We just wanted to check in very briefly—we had been hopeful that we'd be able to circle back with you earlier, but 
our investigation is currently still ongoing, so at the very least we wanted to let you know that we continue to 
appreciate both your client's prior assistance and her willingness to assist in the future. Nothing in our 
investigation since we were last substantively in touch has changed our view of your client, and we hope to be able 
to be in touch with you in the coming weeks with an update. In the interim, we do continue to view her status as 
we've previously conveyed, and please let us know if any issues arise on your end. 
thank you,

PROFFER AGREEMENT 
With respect to the meeting of 
"Client") and her attorney, Joseph
Nascimento, Esq., with Assistant United States Attorneys 
and 
to be 
held on July 12, 2019 ("the meeting"), the following understandings exist: 
(1) THE IS NOT A COOPERATION AGREEMENT. The Client has agreed to 
provide the Government with information, and to respond to questions, so that the Government 
may evaluate Client's information and responses in making prosecutive decisions. By receiving 
Client's proffer, the Government does not agree to make a motion on the Client's behalf or to enter 
into a cooperation agreement, plea agreement, immunity or non-prosecution agreement. The 
Government makes no representation about the likelihood that any such agreement will be reached 
in connection with this proffer. 
(2) In any prosecution brought against Client by this Office, except as provided below the 
Government will not offer in evidence on its case-in-chief, or in connection with any sentencing 
proceeding for the purpose of determining an appropriate sentence, any statements made by Client 
at the meeting, except (a) in a prosecution for false statements, obstruction of justice or perjury 
with respect to any acts committed or statements made during or after the meeting or testimony 
given after the meeting; or (b) if, at any time following the meeting, Client becomes a fugitive 
from justice. 
(3) Notwithstanding item (2) above: (a) the Government may use information derived 
directly or indirectly from the meeting for the purpose of obtaining leads to other evidence, which 
evidence may be used in any prosecution of Client by the Government; (b) in any prosecution 
brought against Client, the Government may use statements made by Client at the meeting and all 
evidence obtained directly or indirectly therefrom for the purpose of cross-examination should 
Client testify; and (c) the Government may also use statements made by Client at the meeting to 
rebut any evidence or arguments offered by or on behalf of Client (including arguments made or 
issues raised sua sponte by the District Court) at any stage of the criminal prosecution (including 
bail, all phases of trial, and sentencing) in any prosecution brought against Client. 
(4) The Client understands and agrees that in the event the Client seeks to qualify for a 
reduction in sentence under Title 18, United States Code, Section 3553(f), United States 
Sentencing Guidelines, Sections 2D1.1(b)(18) or 5C1.2, or Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(b), the Office may 
offer or use at any stage of the criminal proceeding any statement made by Client during the 
meeting, and all evidence obtained directly or indirectly therefrom, to the extent such use is 
consistent with Section 402 of the First Step Act of 2018. 
(5) To the extent that the Government is entitled under this Agreement to offer in evidence 
any statements made by Client or leads obtained therefrom, Client shall assert no claim under the 
United States Constitution, any statute, Rule 410 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, or any other 
federal rule that such statements or any leads therefrom should be suppressed. It is the intent of 
this Agreement to waive all rights in the foregoing respects.

(6) If this Office receives a request from another prosecutor's office for access to 
information obtained pursuant to this Proffer Agreement, this Office may furnish such information 
but will do so only on the condition that the requesting office honor the provisions of this 
Agreement. 
(7) It is further understood that this Agreement is limited to the statements made by Client 
at the meeting and does not apply to any oral, written or recorded statements made by Client at 
any other time. No understandings, promises, agreements and/or conditions have been entered 
into with respect to the meeting other than those set forth in this Agreement and none will be

Subject: Maxwell Order on Flashlights/Sleep Disruptions 
a
FYI, Judge Nathan denied Maxwell's request to direct the MDC to stop the flashlight checks, but (reasonably) 
d the MDC to consider whether sleep disruptions can be reduced for pretrial detainees, and to ensure that 
Maxwell is only subjected to necessary security protocols. 
ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On April 29, 2021, counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell wrote to the 
Court requesting that the Court address her sleeping conditions, with particular emphasis on 
counsel's representation, unsupported by affidavit or other factual showing, that guards are 
shining a flashlight in Maxwell's eyes every 15 minutes at night. Dkt. No. 256. Defense counsel 
claims that the flashlight surveillance in Maxwell's eyes is disrupting her sleep, which in turn is 
impacting her ability to prepare for and withstand trial. The Court sought more information by 
ordering the Government to confer with legal counsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond 
to certain questions. Dkt. No. 257. In response, the Government states that MDC staff conduct 
flashlight checks of all inmates as a matter of course. Dkt. No. 270. As reported by the 
Government, inmates housed with cell mates in the Special Housing Unit are checked with 
flashlights every 30 minutes. Inmates housed with others in the general population are 
checked multiple times per night at regular intervals. The Government further reports that to 
conduct the checks, flashlights are pointed at the ceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate 
is present, breathing, and not in distress. As the Government explains, there are a number of 
neutral reasons why BOP's flashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those 
of other inmates, including that Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and the 
potential stress for inmates that can arise in high-profile cases. The MDC has determined that 
these factors necessitate more frequent safety and security checks. The Government also 
indicates that the prohibition on eye masks is a generally applicable policy, but that Maxwell, 
like other inmates, may use other noncontraband items to cover her eyes. To the extent that 
Maxwell's April 29, 2021 letter asks the Court to override BOP's determination as to the 
frequency of appropriate safety and security check procedures, that request is denied as 
factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported. Certainly nothing in the record plausibly 
establishes that current protocols interfere with Maxwell's ability to prepare for her trial and 
communicate with her lawyers. Defense counsel's May 7, 2021 letter, Dkt. No. 272, describes 
generalized grievances but makes no additional specific and supported application for relief. 
Nevertheless, the Court urges the MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pretrial 
detainees can be reduced. The Court also admonishes the MDC and the Government to 
continue to ensure that Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols that BOP 
determines are necessary for her safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable

factors, and consistent with the treatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees. The 
Government shall provide a copy of this Order to the Warden and General Counsel for the 
MDC. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 5/14/2021) (In')

A couple questions on this list. First, are you sure that NYCO24392 was provided to us? I ask because as of 7/14 (last 
Tuesday), in an email 
said we didn't have that drive yet — see the spreadsheet in the attached email — and I also 
referred to that number on Wednesday in our call as one we didn't have and CART didn't say anything different. 
The other question is, do you have any info on NYCO24328 in terms of device, serial number, etc? I ask because looking at 
the same chart that 
sent in the attached email last Tuesday, there doesn't appear to be *any* device with that 
identifier. The list goes 326, 327, 329.

M, 
Here you go. Almost everything is over at Southern once I drop off the phones. Just I laptop and 2 desktops to get to you. I has to 
re-process, so I am not sure how long it will be as it is a large item. As far as the stuff I have already produced, I can re-work it to split 
things out, but unsure how much static it will give me. Might be fast, might be a pain. Unknown at this point, but I am sure we can get 
something moving. Any questions, let me know.

It's correct that SDNY doesn't have it. I don't know who the FOIA request is directed to — whether it's just to our office or 
to FBI or DOJ as a whole. I think the office's practice on this case is to forward all FOIA inquiries to 
who is 
handling them as the main point of contact.

The Clerk of Court is directed

September 4, 2020 of Case No. 20cv00484. 
Dated: 09/09/2020 
SO ORDERED 
DEBRA FREEMAN 
United States Magistrate Judge 
Re: 
Jane Doe v. Darren It Indyke, et aL, 20 Civ. 484 (DCF) (JGK) 
Dear Judge Freeman: 
The Government respectfully submits this letter to request that the Court: (1) permit the 
Government to intervene in the above-referenced matter for the limited purpose of seeking a stay 
of the action, and (2) stay this matter in its entirety pending the resolution of the criminal 
prosecution against Ghislaine Maxwell in the matter of United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 
330 (AJN). As discussed below, the Government submits that a complete stay of this civil action 
will serve the public interest of preserving the integrity of the criminal prosecution against 
Maxwell and will conserve private, public, and judicial resources; and that those interests will 
outweigh any delay or disruption caused to the resolution of this civil action. 
On June 29, 2020, a federal grand jury in this District returned a sealed indictment (the 
"Indictment") charging Ghislaine Maxwell with one count of conspiracy to entice minors to travel 
to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; one count of enticing a minor to travel 
to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2422 and 2; one count of conspiracy to 
transport minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; one count of 
transporting minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2423 and 2; and 
two counts of perjury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1623. The charges arise from a scheme to 
sexually abuse underage girls at Jeffrey Epstein's properties in New York, Florida, and New 
Mexico, between approximately 1994 and 1997. As the Indictment details, Maxwell played a key 
role in Epstein's abuse of minors by helping Epstein to identify, groom, and ultimately abuse 
underage girls. 
' While the Government understands that letters from parties are required to be filed via ECF, the 
Government is not a party in this matter, and the ECF system does not permit non-parties to file 
letters.

Case 1:20-cv-00484-JGK-DCF Document 80 Filed 09/09/20 Page 2 of 4 
Page 2 
Over the past year, a number of plaintiffs have filed civil complaints in this District 
asserting claims arising from Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse of minor girls. Of those lawsuits, the 
above-captioned matter is the lone case in this District that has not yet been either resolved or 
stayed at this point, as far as the Government is aware. In particular, this matter appears to be the 
only remaining active civil case in this District in which claims against Ghislaine Maxwell have 
been asserted. 
This Court has the inherent power to stay civil cases in the interests of justice pending the 
completion of criminal prosecution. See Landis v. North Am. Co., 299 U.S. 248, 255 (1936); Kashi 
v. Gratsos, 790 F.2d 1050, 1057 (2d Cir. 1986). Courts routinely grant applications to stay civil 
proceedings in order to protect a pending criminal case. See, e.g., Johnson v. New York City Police 
Dep't, 01 Civ. 6570 (RCC) (JCF), 2003 WL 21664882, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. July 16, 2003); Okoli v. 
Cty. of Nassau, 15 Civ. 0701 (JS) (SIL), 2015 WL 8207496, at *24 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 7, 2015). 
The complaint in this civil action alleges that Maxwell facilitated the sexual abuse of a 
minor by Jeffrey Epstein in the 1990s. Those allegations will, by definition, touch on matters 
relating to the pending Indictment. Indeed, based on a review of the civil complaint, the 
Government understands that it is likely that should discovery in civil action go forward, multiple 
witnesses or potential witnesses at the criminal trial would be subject to deposition. Accordingly, 
there is a significant risk that proceeding with this civil matter would adversely affect the ongoing 
criminal prosecution against Maxwell. Those concerns include, among others: (i) subjecting 
potential trial witnesses in the criminal matter to depositions by civil litigants in advance of their 
testimony on similar matters in the criminal trial; (ii) subjecting the defendant to a deposition on 
matters for which she presently stands criminally charged in advance of her criminal trial; and (iii) 
the potential waste of significant judicial, government, and defense resources that would result 
from having both the civil and criminal proceeding move forward simultaneously given the 
potential of the resolution of the criminal case to impact any resolution of the civil action. 
Courts generally apply a five-factor test in determining whether to stay a civil action 
pending the resolution of a related criminal matter, considering: (i) the private interests of the 
plaintiffs in proceeding expeditiously with the civil litigation balanced against the prejudice to the 
plaintiffs if delayed; (ii) the private interests of and burden on the defendants; (iii) the interests of 
the courts; (iv) the interests of persons not parties to the civil litigation; and (v) the public interest. 
SEC v. Beacon Hill Asset Mgmt. LLC, No. 02 Civ. 8855, 2003 WL 554618, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 
27, 2003); see also SEC v. Doody IV, 186 F. Supp. 2d 379, 381 (S.D.N.Y. 2002). Here, the factors 
weigh in favor of granting a stay. 
Here, while the Government appreciates the plaintiff's interest in resolving the civil suit,2
any potential prejudice to the plaintiff is outweighed by both the public interest in the enforcement 
of criminal laws and the fact that resolution of the criminal process may result in a more efficient 
resolution of the civil suit. See generally In re Ivan F. Boesky Sec. Litig., 128 F.R.D. 47, 49 
(S.D.N.Y. 1989) ("the public interest in the criminal case is entitled to precedence over the civil 
As Maxwell also seeks a stay of this matter, it does not appear that granting the stay would cause 
any prejudice to Maxwell. 
EFTA00024725

litigant"); United States v. Hugo Key & Son, Inc., 672 F. Supp. 656, 685 (D.R.I. 1987) ("While a 
civil litigant with a private dispute has an interest in the prompt disposition of his or her claims, 
the public has a greater interest in the enforcement of the criminal law."). In particular, any 
concern regarding the potential delay of this civil suit is outweighed by the concern that Maxwell 
would seek to assert her Fifth Amendment rights rather than submit to a deposition in the civil 
action, and that depositions of other witnesses could potentially interfere with the criminal 
prosecution. See United States v. Saad, 229 F.R.D. 90, 91 (S.D.N.Y. 2005) (noting that 
invocations of the Fifth Amendment privilege can disrupt the orderly conduct of a civil case). 
Moreover, given the factual overlap between the civil and criminal cases, allowing the criminal 
matter to be resolved in the first instance may result in a narrowing of the factual and legal issues 
before this Court. See Volmar Dist, Inc. v. New York Post Co., 152 F.R.D. 36, 40 (S.D.N.Y. 
1993). Accordingly, the interests of judicial economy are better served by the stay the Government 
seeks. 
Additionally, consideration of the interests of third parties, including the public, weighs in 
favor of granting the stay. In particular, the Government is not aware of any third parties that 
would be harmed by a stay, and, to the contrary, the public interest in the enforcement of the 
criminal law will be served by a stay. Multiple third-party witnesses possess information that is 
potentially relevant to both this lawsuit and the criminal prosecution.3 Premature disclosure of the 
testimony of these witnesses could severely impair the criminal prosecution. First, such witnesses 
may be forced to testify about any efforts to assist the criminal investigation and prosecution, and 
may thereby expose facts about the investigation that would otherwise not be disclosed far in 
advance of a criminal trial and could potentially expose witnesses and/or their families to 
harassment. Moreover, permitting any discovery to proceed in this lawsuit would enable Maxwell 
to seek a preview of trial testimony in the criminal case, and would afford her with a broader array 
of discovery than she is entitled to in the criminal case. See Johnson, 2003 WL 21664882, at *2 
("[T]he civil action, if not stayed, might undermine the criminal defendant's Fifth Amendment 
privilege against self-incrimination, expand the rights of discovery beyond the limits of the state's 
criminal procedure law, expose the basis of the defense to the prosecution, or otherwise prejudice 
the criminal case."). Finally, the Government notes that Maxwell's access to information about 
the criminal matter is under the jurisdiction of the Honorable Alison J. Nathan, who has entered a 
protective order and has issued several rulings regarding the scope of discovery that Maxwell is 
In an August 25, 2020 opinion, Judge Nathan held that Maxwell is not entitled to know who the 
Government's trial witnesses are at this stage of the criminal case. United States v. Ghislaine 
Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN), Dkt. 49. Consistent with that ruling, the Government is not including 
detailed information in this letter about who those trial witnesses might be and will not engage 
with Maxwell's speculation as to who those witnesses may be. The Government respectfully 
submits that the Court need not make any findings on that score to resolve this motion, as a 
complaint concerning sexual abuse of minors by Epstein and Maxwell will inevitably implicate 
documents, witnesses, and other evidence that overlaps with the criminal matter, whether or not 
the plaintiff in this action—or the conduct she alleges—has any direct connection to the charges in 
the Indictment. If it would be useful to the Court, however, the Government is prepared to provide 
an a parte submission under seal detailing the anticipated overlap of witnesses between the 
criminal case and this case.

entitled to and the manner in which she may or may not use that information. Given that Maxwell 
is represented by the same counsel in both the criminal and civil matter, a stay is necessary to avoid 
blurring the carefully drawn boundaries between the criminal case and pending civil litigation. 
The Government recognizes that the plaintiff in this action has an interest in pursuing her 
claim against Maxwell. To that end, the Government has considered whether a partial stay—or 
some other remedy short of a complete stay of this action—would address the Government's 
concerns. However, after carefully considering the issues in this case and the pending criminal 
case, the Government respectfully submits that nothing short of a full stay of this matter would 
address the Government's concerns and preserve the public's substantial interest in avoiding 
interference with prosecution of the criminal case 
Finally, the Government notes that any stay would be no longer than necessary to 
accommodate the interests of the criminal process. At this time, the Government only seeks a stay 
until the conclusion of the criminal trial, which is scheduled to begin on July 12, 2021.

Hi =, 
Hope you're doing well. As our team is reviewing these materials in connection with discovery, we wanted to follow up 
with you about this project. In particular, we were hoping you could tell us how your office approached CDs that were in 
the boxes of materials from Florida. We noticed in the scans we received some documents that looked like the attached 
file — which looks like a photocopy of the CD. Were those materials downloaded by your office? If not, no worries at all, 
we have them from the primary file, but we wanted to check with you to make sure we had the complete set of materials 
you sent.

Totally understand about the network issues—we can relate. I do still think it will be helpful to all sit down together to 
have an in-person discussion, to make sure everybody is on the same page. Are folks available for that next week? And 
what I think would be most helpful to facilitate that would be a spreadsheet of each separate device referenced in the two 
search warrant returns, with columns for whether we've dumped the contents, whether they've been reviewed and/or 
transferred, what portions were transferred, etc. 
Something roughly like the attached, with any other categories you think would be useful — and the info on the attached is 
mostly hypothetical, obviously, just as examples. That will help us fully understand what's been reviewed, transferred, 
and received so far, and what remains. 
(Also just on the pictures, we do want copies of those as well, please including from the discs and the devices — I think FBI 
was going to do an initial screen to make sure no CP, and since I think the answer was no, we'll need to get those to be 
able to review them as well.) 
many thanks,

Sony for the delayed response. They are tearing out our old network and giving us a new one, they mandated we 
delete old stuff (about 400 TB worth). Now that they are working on replacing the network, we can do only local 
work. I should be able to give you an accounting of what is what. I can say, off the top of my head, that all 
windows based items from the NY search have been handed over as well as all loose media. The CDs from NY 
only contained pictures, no documents. There are still some Apple items from NY that need to be produced. As 
far as the Island stuff goes, the 1st item on your spreadsheet, the "kitchen" mac has been produced. Still working 
on the rest.

Following up on the below from last weekend, I'm still not sure how we're addressing this so I thought it would make 
sense for us to all schedule a (hopefully relatively brief) meeting to all get on the same page? We didn't hear back on 
EFTA00024750
--- PAGE 3 ---
which files had previously been provided, but our tech folks did their best to differentiate, and we got access to the 
materials yesterday and its well over a million documents, and we don't have any idea what we're looking at — i.e., which 
devices the materials came from, whether it's full or partial results, how many more devices we have coming, etc. 
Based on the attached search warrant returns, it looks like from the New York mansion (the PDF) there are approximately 
devices that would have storage (computers, hard drives, thumb drives, etc.) and that's not even counting at least 60+ 
CDs. And then from the Virgin Islands (the Excel spreadsheet), at least more than 25 devices, including multiple servers / 
server racks. 
So we gotta know what we've already received, what remains, anticipated schedule, etc, and I know it's a lot of moving 
pieces on all sides so wanted to loop in everybody at once. The case team will be in California this coming week from 
Tuesday through Friday, but then I think generally around the first week of March, which will hopefully be plenty of time 
to schedule a productive meeting. 
thanks all,

I'm not sure who's the exact right person to ask this, so wanted to get everybody on one email chain about it — I have the 
hard drive that 
dropped off that has new Epstein search warrant materials, but it looks like there are also old 
materials (that I think we had previously received and uploaded??) on the hard drive, and so I'm not sure what's new. 
Just generally, and 
and I talked about this last week too, but it's basically impossible for us to keep track of what 
we're getting, and what has been completed, without some kind of identification or labeling system, along with a list of 
which devices have been extracted and downloaded. 
So for example on the hard drive currently, there are 38 folders labeled "loadFiles" through "37loadFiles" with a modified 
date of 11/14/19, which I think we may have already previously received — but I'm not sure, because we haven't gotten 
any info on which folders match up to which devices, etc. And then there's another folder titled "NYC024362" that has a 
modified date of 1/27/20, so I think that may be the materials we hadn't previously received? That folder by itself has 
more than 600,000 items. 
I don't want to give 
anything that we've already previously received and uploaded, and I can't tell from the folder or 
file names whether everything on the drive is new, or whether just additional materials were saved onto it in addition to 
what we already have. =, 
are you able to give us some guidance on this? Ultimately what we really need is a 
spreadsheet of every device, whether it's been dumped (or partially dumped), and then identifying that same info —
which device, and what materials from it — are being given to us with each data transfer. Otherwise I think 
organizationally and for review purposes it will be a total disaster for us. 
We're happy to have a meeting on this if that's helpful — and thanks everybody for the assistance.

DAWN M. HUGHES, PH.D., ABPP 
CIJ ICAL A D FORE SIC PSYCHOLO 
NEW YORK STATE LICENSED PSYCIKH.OGIST 
BOARD CERTIFIED IN FORENSIC PSYCHOLOGY 
ENGAGEMENT AGREEMENT FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL EXPERT SERVICES 
In the matter of 
Service. A forensic psychological service is a psychological evaluation, consultation, or 
expert witness service that is undertaken for legal purposes. Dr. Hughes provides forensic 
psychological services to a law firm who is the client. The litigant is not Dr. Hughes' client. 
A forensic psychological evaluation typically involves face-to-face interview with the person 
to be evaluated, psychological testing, collaborative interviews with individuals deemed 
necessary by Dr. Hughes to conduct a thorough and complete evaluation, and review of 
documents and other evidence. Evaluation sessions, including testing, are arranged by 
appointment. Dr. Hughes may form and provide findings, impressions, opinions, 
conclusions, and recommendations regarding the legal issue(s) at hand. These services are 
not intended for the purpose of therapy. Dr. Hughes' findings, impressions, opinions, 
conclusions, and recommendations are based on the evaluation procedure and are 
independent. 
Confidentiality. The usual laws governing confidentiality between psychotherapist and 
patient do not apply to the relationship or information obtained during the course of the 
forensic evaluation. Information obtained in the course of the forensic evaluation will be 
shared with the individual's attorney. This policy also recognizes Dr. Hughes' use of 
professional test scoring services, and other professional consultation as deemed advisable 
by Dr. Hughes. Be aware that in certain instances the law requires Dr. Hughes to disclose 
privileged information, for example, in situations of suspected child abuse, of potential harm 
to oneself or another, and in instances where the court orders the disclosure of privileged 
information and records. 
Results. Written reports may be requested by an attorney or the court. Any results, reports, 
and copies of records shall only be prepared, written, and provided after the full evaluation is 
completed. Partial reports will not be provided. 
Fees. Dr. Hughes' usual and customary fee is $500 per hour or portion thereof for all 
forensic services including but not limited to evaluation appointments, psychological testing 
and test scoring, collateral interviews, attorney consultation, review of documents/records, 
preparation of written reports/affidavits/declarations, deposition and testimony preparation, 
and travel time (door to door). 
Court and deposition testimony are billed in full or half-day increments at the hourly rate of 
$500 — that is, $2000 per half-day (9:00 to 1:00) and $4000 per full-day (9:00 to 5:00). 
Payment is required at least 72 hours in advance. In the event that a deposition/testimony is 
EFTA00024767
--- PAGE 2 ---
cancelled, or the case settled less than 72 hours in advance, Dr. Hughes will be paid for time 
allotted for said testimony as Dr. Hughes' schedule is made far in advance. In addition, if 
opposing counsel calls for my deposition and refuses to pay according to my stated fee 
structure, the retaining attorney is responsible. Fees for photocopying and other staff-related 
activities are billed at $50 per hour. Disbursements, which will also be billed, include actual 
costs associated with psychological testing, for example, test scoring, as well as travel 
expenses and other reasonable expenses incurred. 
The financially responsible party shall be the law firm by whom Dr. Hughes is retained. The 
responsible party shall pay the fees and disbursements for all time and services provided by 
Dr. Hughes. Dr. Hughes will not accept payment from the litigant directly. If the litigant 
fails to attend the scheduled evaluation, fails to provide more than 72 hours notice of 
cancellation, or fails to cooperate with the evaluation, the financially responsible party shall 
be responsible for full payment for full time allotted for the evaluation. 
Retainer or Court Order. A retainer of $7000 is due at least 48 hours before the first 
consultation or evaluation session with Dr. Hughes and before Dr. Hughes may be identified 
to opposing counsel or to the Court as having been retained by the law firm. The first $3500 
is non-refundable. The remaining retainer shall be applied to the final billing statement, and 
Dr. Hughes shall return any unused remaining portion of the retainer to the payer. In lieu of 
a retainer, a court order or other document guaranteeing payment will be required. 
The actual final cost of forensic services varies widely depending on the amount of time 
spent by Dr. Hughes, the amount of contact with the parties and the attorneys, the amount 
of information to be read, and the degree of complexity of the matter. Dr. Hughes' fees may 
substantially exceed the initial retainer and additional retainers shall be required. Additional 
retainers and fees shall be paid promptly when requested by Dr. Hughes. 
Agreement. All agreements and contracts with Dr. Hughes are in writing. Any 
modification of the terms of this agreement must be in writing and signed by Dr. Hughes. 
Dr. Hughes, in agreeing to provide this forensic psychological service, is specifically relying 
on the responsible party's agreement to abide by all the terms of this agreement. 
An authorized representative of the law firm retaining Dr. Hughes shall signify agreement to 
this Engagement Agreement by signing below.

On July 2, 2020, the United States Attorney's Office announced the unsealing of federal felony charges against 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL on charges of enticement of a minor to engage in illegal sex acts, transportation of a minor to 
engage in illegal sex acts, conspiracy, and perjury. These crimes are alleged to have occurred in locations including, but 
not limited to, New York, Florida, New Mexico, and the United Kingdom. 
If you believe you are a victim of GHISLAINE MAXWELL, from during any time period and in any location, please contact 
the Victim / Witness specialists at the U.S. Attorney's Office listed below.

Hi Louise, 
Thanks very much. Unfortunately, there are restrictions on the types of video conferencing platforms we are permitted 
to use, but we would suggest a video conference over WebEx, which seems to work well. If that's okay with you, we can 
send a WebEx video conference link, which should not require downloading any software. All we would need to set up

Following up on the below, given the development of the virus pandemic over the past week, any foreign travel for us 
is completely shut down. We certainly will plan to come to the U.K. whenever we are permitted, but in the interim 
this makes it even more valuable to get even a summary of what your client would expect to convey to us. Would it be 
possible to set up a call for later this week or sometime next week? And profound apologies for the inconvenience in

Just to clarify, would it be possible for you to provide us even a very general or high-level summary of what she has 
told you? We ordinarily don't go into interviews completely blind when witnesses have counsel — and the Weinstein 
investigation had a great number of problems that we have been able to avoid. And separately, we'll of course keep 
you updated on our approval process as well.

I am afraid that an attorney proffer will not be possible. I have been working with the DA in New York on the Weinstein 
case and have simply offered up my clients to questions which has worked well. 
I am of course happy to speak over the phone but it seems to me that you are better off getting the information first 
hand. If you wish it may be sensible for you to initially have a call with my client? 
My client has made a complaint to the Met police regarding a sexual assault by Jeffrey Epstein whilst in London and in 
the employment of G Maxwell. Apart from the complaint itself, no further information has been provided to the police. 
I appreciate the issue re coronavirus of course. 
Kind regards, 
Jill

That's great, thank you for letting us know, and we'll check on that right away and get back to you as soon as possible. 
The only wrinkle, which unfortunately is completely beyond our control, is that there is now some talk of government 
international travel being prevented due to the coronavirus situation, but we'll talk to the relevant people here 
immediately. 
One thing that would be extremely helpful for us in the near-term, including in terms of getting approvals here — and 
we talked about this on the phone as well — would be to get an attorney proffer about your understanding of generally 
what information you expect your client will convey on the subjects we've spoken about? We completely understand 
that it's best to have her tell her story directly to us, but in terms of our preparation it's often very useful for both us 
and the witness for us to have had a conversation with counsel in the first instance. Would it be possible to set up a 
call to have that discussion? We could do as soon as tomorrow or Friday, or also next week. 
Thanks very much,

No problem at all, we understand this takes time, and we appreciate you getting back to us, and we're very grateful 
that your client is open to speaking with us. 
On your questions, we are certainly fine with the first two questions / requests — we're happy to meet with you and 
your client in an initial conversation, during which we can do the kind of introductions and explanations we've done 
with you (and that we do with all victim witnesses we meet), including answering any questions to the best of our 
ability, and then to take a break and have a more substantive discussion later on. 
Regarding the friend, does that individual also represent her as counsel? We aren't normally able to include 
individuals in addition to the witness and counsel in an interview—what does sometimes work is for someone who is 
providing support (a parent, friend, etc.) to be close by for any discussions, assistance, etc. anytime that a witness 
wants to speak with that person, which would of course be totally fine in this instance. Or if he represents her in his 
capacity as an attorney then he of course could be in the interview in that role (with the only caveat that we would 
just want to confirm that he himself is not separately a witness of some sort in the case). We unfortunately are not 
able to pay for third parties (including counsel) to travel in connection with witness interviews, though — if it's 
preferable, we certainly could pay for your client's travel to the U.S. for the interview, including airfare and lodging, if 
that makes it easier for the friend to be present? And we're happy to discuss any of this further by email or phone if 
that's useful — I'll be at my desk for the next several hours and most of tomorrow, at 
, or we could 
also set a time to chat, whatever would be helpful.

Hello
Apologies for the slight delay. My client is willing to help but asks the following: 
• 
That there be a morning meeting at which introductions with a discussion as to the investigation and my 
clients involvement. I appreciate that you have explained this to me but I think further verbal clarification 
would assist. 
• 
In the afternoon and after a break, my client would be willing to answer questions, in so far as she can. 
• 
That a friend of hers be allowed to be present as well. However that friend is based in the US and would 
need to be flown over to London. He is a US lawyer.

Following up on our phone call, thank you for talking with us again, and we wanted to get back to you regarding 
some of the additional follow-up questions you asked, and to describe in more detail for your client how we would 
expect to approach any discussion with your client if she were comfortable meeting with us. 
The absolute most important thing is that any discussion would be entirely voluntary, and by that we mean the 
decision to meet with us but also as to any topic or question—your client would be absolutely free to determine 
what topics she felt comfortable discussing. There is absolutely no pressure on victim witnesses to address 
anything that would make them uncomfortable at any time, and even if your client was willing to meet with us, we 
would tell her, as we do for any witness, that if any topic comes up that she wants to skip, or discuss with you 
privately, that is no problem at all. 
In fact, if you and she would prefer, we would be happy to have a meeting where we simply introduced ourselves, 
explained the status of our investigation, talked about how a discussion would proceed if your client ended up 
being comfortable with that, and answered in person any questions she. We have done that previously, where we 
do the talking rather than asking questions in an initial meeting, and that would of course be without any 
requirement for anything additional if she preferred not to. As I mentioned on the phone, we have consistently 
found that we are able to reassure individuals when we have the opportunity to meet in person so they can see 
directly our interest in approaching these discussions with great sensitivity and care. As I also mentioned on the 
phone, even if your client were willing to speak with us, there would be absolutely no need or requirement for her 
to talk about any assault or victimization she experienced. We wrote in our first email that we would primarily be 
interested in talking about topics such as the general scope of her employment, directions she received from 
Epstein or Maxwell, etc., and as always we would be guided by her comfort level. 
In terms of who would attend a meeting, we almost always work in pairs, so two prosecutors and two officers, and 
that's not to have extra people, but rather because it helps us to be as efficient as we can, and so witnesses can 
meet the people on the team. Our team is also majority female, and we always tell witnesses that if topics come 
up in a discussion that they would prefer to speak about just with women, that's fine and we can be flexible in the 
moment and are always guided by the comfort level of the victim. But I also want to stress that in terms of your 
client in particular, we don't expect to initially address issues of a very personal or sexual nature, and we certainly 
would tell you in advance if there came a time when we thought that might be important to address, and how we 
could facilitate that. Who exactly from our team would be at any meeting would depend on schedules, but we can 
assure you that every one of us has now spoken with dozens of victims in this case, and every one of us has 
extensive experience more generally working with victims and working on cases involving sex offenses. We are 
proud of how we have been able to work with victims in this case especially, given all of the circumstances, and we 
absolutely would take the same sensitive approach with your client as we have with the many other victims in this 
case who have spoken with us. 
Again, if it would be helpful even for us to just come to the U.K. and introduce ourselves and explain in person how 
our process works, and answer any questions your client has in person, we would absolutely be happy to do that 
with no obligation at all from her. We also could do that with the possibility that if she felt comfortable, we could 
just address the general subject of her employment, for example. But no obligation and no pressure. We continue 
to appreciate your and her willingness to even broach the possibility of a discussion, and we hope this is helpful. 
thank you very much,

Subject: RE: Epstein investigation 
•> 
Thanks for circling back, and we'll do our best to answer these questions. In terms of who would be in the room, 
the most likely answer is that it would be two of the prosecutors and the two law enforcement officers on the 
case. The only reason I saw "most likely" rather than having a definitive answer is that when we're interviewing in 
a foreign country, it sometimes is the case the local law enforcement also insists on having representatives 
present. I don't believe that's required in the U.K., but we can check on it and give you a definitive answer in the 
coming days if that's useful. (Also, if she preferred to be interviewed in the U.S., we certainly could guarantee that 
the room would be just the case team, and we could arrange for travel and lodging for her. Let us know if that's the 
case, but otherwise we're of course happy to travel to her.) 
Regarding access to notes, it would principally be the investigative team—so again, the prosecutors and the FBI 
team working on the case. Our respective supervisors also theoretically have access to our files, but the reports 
are not generally widely disseminated. The basic logistics are that an agent takes notes during an interview, and 
then types up those notes into a formal report (called an FBI Form 302). We don't ordinarily share notes with other 
entities, but I can also check on that to see if I can make a more specific representation with respect to your client. 
With respect to anonymity, I confess that I'm not familiar with the distinction you're referring to. In terms of our 
investigation, we don't publicly disclose the names of individuals we meet with, and we don't disclose to any other 
witnesses, for example, the identities of victims or witnesses we are meeting with. (And our policies on that don't 
change even for individuals who are in the position of your client, who have been widely publicly reported to have 
been connected to Epstein and/or his employees or associates). But if that doesn't answer your question, we're of 
course happy to discuss further. Let me know if it might be useful to have a call? Or if not, also happy to address 
any follow-up via email. 
thanks,

Hi 
Thanks for this. I've been asked who would be in the room and thereafter who would have access to any 
notes made. Would her permission be sought before disclosing to any other parties or officials? 
As you know there is a real difficulty in relation to her anonymity in the US versus the UK. Are you able 
to provide any comfort on this? 
Many thanks

Ms. Greenfield, 
Thank you again for speaking with us earlier today regarding our interest in talking with your client in connection 
with our investigation into the conduct of Jeffrey Epstein. 
As requested, we wanted to briefly memorialize our current views and understandings of your client, and also to 
reiterate our interest in approaching any discussion with great care and sensitivity, particularly to avoid adding to 
her trauma or causing re-victimization. 
As we mentioned on the phone, your client is not a target of our investigation—it sounds like the analogue in the 
U.K. may be the "suspect" category—and we currently do not have reason to believe that she has committed any 
U.S. federal crime. As we discussed, our knowledge of your client specifically is somewhat limited, having never 
spoken to her—and therefore knowing about her only through other witnesses and records—but it certainly has 
been our experience that the overwhelming majority of young women and girls who were in the orbit of Jeffrey 
Epstein during the relevant periods were subject to his abuse. It does not surprise us, nor do we have any trouble 
believing, that your client was similarly a victim. I hope that is helpful in understanding the capacity in which we 
hope to speak with her. 
Separately, and as we also discussed, any discussion with our team would be entirely voluntary—and that extends 
not just to whether she would be willing to meet with us at all, but also including her ability to decline to discuss 
particular topics or even particular questions, and to talk with her counsel at any time, to take any breaks that 
would be beneficial while we're meeting, etc. 
In terms of topic areas, we would be hoping to learn about the general narrative of her interactions with Epstein 
and his other associates and employees, including Ghislaine Maxwell, whom we understand she may have 
worked directly for. That would broadly include how she came to be in contact with them, the nature and scope 
of her employment, any instructions she was given relating to other women or girls, and just generally her 
experiences and observations in interacting with them. We ordinarily would also be interested in understanding 
the general nature of the abuse she was subjected to, but I want to emphasize that we would not need to discuss 
with her the specifics if she weren't comfortable with that, and in particular we often don't even broach that 
subject in a first meeting. 
Please let us know if you have any additional questions, and in particular whether any other information from us 
would be useful, and we look forward to speaking with you again soon. 
Regards,

You're welcome. 
Would 10 am work as a standing legal call through the end of this week (and Monday, if you think that's a good idea), in 
advance of the arraignment on Tuesday? However, after this, defense counsel should be required to follow the same 
protocols as all other inmates' counsel with respect to requesting legal calls. 
I also just want to make clear that defense counsel sent no requests yesterday that I am aware of, and we were able to 
facilitate a call yesterday evening following a request from your office, and today, I received one request, about mid-day, 
that we were again able to accommodate. So, I do not think it is fair at all to categorize this as defense counsel having 
difficulty scheduling legal calls.

Team, 
Checking in on the status for the motions. I'm attaching the NPA point draft, which can be folded in. Can folks let me know 
the status of pending motion points, for planning purposes? I think our deadline to get this to the chiefs is EOD today, so 
ideally we'd combine this by this afternoon and circulate quickly around the team for edits.

On October 20, 2005, at approximately 8:30 a.m., Thursday morning, I 
was advised by Captain MEMPEIthat a search warrant would be executed 
and that I was to assemble the Crime Scene Investigative Team and 
stand by the south side of the building ready to go. I designated 
Evidence Specialist 
to handle the inventory return, the 
documentation of the property receipts and the collection and bagging 
of the evidence at the scene. I further instructed CSI 
ID 
, to accompany us and perform the role of photographing the 
scene and the items that may be taken into custody by the affiant, 
Detective 
ID # 
My responsibility was to go through from the reading of the warrant to 
the final exit from the residence and perform a video recording of the 
reading of the warrant, the initial walk through of the residence 
showing the current condition and then finally a walk through of the 
residence at the time of the police exit. 
We started out towards the residence, which was located at 
and arrived at approximately 9:33 a.m. The search was 
conducted, items were collected by Evidence Specialists 400mg,

was concluded at approximately 3:05 p.m. whereupon Detective
and I were the last two officers in the house. Upon securing the 
residence we met with the gentleman who identified himself to 
Detective 
as the lawyer for the defendant and he was informed 
that the residence was secured and that copies of the inventory return 
had been left on the first floor table of the personal assistant's 
office. 
Detective

Date: Fri, 21 May 2021 17:45:41 +0000 
Hi 
We were hoping you could assist us with getting in touch with the OIG lawyer who is responsible for preparing the report 
on Epstein's suicide. We have been trying to get in touch with 
who was previously handling the 
investigation, but understand he may have left the office. The time sensitivity is that we plan to file a public letter by close 
of business today regarding reaching a deferred prosecution agreement with the two guards on duty that night who have 
been charged with falsifying records. The guards have agreed to sit for an interview with our office and DOI-OIG, and 
we'd like to state in the letter that the interviews would occur as part of an ongoing OIG investigation that we expect 
would lead to a public report. However, we don't want to make this representation unless DOJ-OIG is comfortable with it. 
I'm happy to discuss by phone if convenient. 
Thanks very much, 
Chief, Public Corruption Unit

In preparation for our call (which we can reschedule to a time following the discovery deadline), I wanted to send 
around a list of topics to discuss for potential next steps. I'm sure I've missed some items, but this is a starting point at a 
least. 
For context, I think we currently expect to call at least the following witnesses at trial:

*Records custodian from 
• 
*Records custodian from 
• 
*Court reporter(s) from 
*We haven't identified/spoken to these witnesses yet, so that's on the trial prep to-do list as well. 
The following are some potential next steps — either individuals to interview or re-interview, records to search 
for/identify, and so forth. 
• 
Relativity review of GM emails 
• 
Identify an 
employee (likely retired) who managed donor relations with Epstein/can authenticate 
documents 
• 
Identify a PBPD detective who can authenticate items recovered from search of PB house 
•

Great news — after I've reviewed, the drive going to defense today has all the required items for production! I believe we 
will be uploading NYC024318 1871 (iPhone) to this drive (and I've noted the tentative bates number for that on the index, 
attached here and updated on the shared, and in the cover letter, attached) — but other than that, we are all set. 
I've attached a (very basic) cover letter for defense, for your review and relevant additions. Since we are reproducing so 
much to MDC, I also created a unique index for the MDC drive on the shared index. I can attach that chart to defense's 
cover letter when it goes out, if that would be helpful, or I can just keep the MDC index section for our internal 
organization. 
is still working on copying the MDC drive. Hopefully we'll have an update soon. I'm happy to make any changes 
within the cover letter and/or index as necessary. Thank you all!

Hi M, 
It seems like a fair number of Epstein related calls are coming in through the main SDNY line, and we've set up a particular 
line internally for those to be forwarded to. Would it be possible to let the CSOs to know that they should transfer any 
incoming calls to the following extension, where they can leave a message? It's been set up so that those messages will 
auto-forward to our whole team. The number is 212-637-1030.

Victim Attendance at Trial. In orders dated October 14 and November 24, 2021, the S.D.N.Y. 
Court outlined procedures for public access to the trial in this matter. (Trial began on November 
29, 2021, with jury selection.) Specifically, consistent with the District's COVID-19 protocols, the 
Court will ensure public access (with COVID- 19 distancing) to the trial in the courtroom itself and 
in several overflow rooms at the courthouse with live feeds of the proceedings. Beyond the live 
feeds within the courthouse, the trial will not be further broadcast; nor will there be any telephonic 
dial-in to the proceedings. Victim access will be coordinated by the U.S. Attorney's Office Victim-
Witness Coordinator 
those persons for further information. 
Victims who wish to attend the trial may contact either one of 
COVID- I 9 Protocols. Per the S.D.N.Y. Response to COVID-19, anyone who appears at any 
S.D.N.Y. courthouse must complete a questionnaire on the date of the proceeding prior to 
entering the courthouse. All visitors must also have their temperature taken when they arrive at 
the courthouse. Only persons who meet the entry requirements established by the questionnaire 
and whose temperatures are below 100.4 degrees will be allowed to enter the courthouse. All 
visitors must wear a mask that covers the person's nose and mouth. Bandannas, gaiters, and 
masks with valves are not permitted. If a person does not have an approved mask, a screener 
will provide one. Anyone who fails to comply with the COVID-19 protocols that have been 
adopted by the Court will be required to leave the courthouse. There are no exceptions. For more

Subject: Second Circuit Bail Decision 
The Second Circuit today issued an opinion today that will affect bail motions in white collar 
cases and other cases where wealthy defendants seek to be released to home confinement 
and monitored by private security companies. Specifically, in United States v. Boustani (copy 
attached), the court held that the Bail Reform Act does not permit wealthy defendants to be 
released to "self-funded private jails" in circumstances where poorer defendants would be 
detained: 
"We now expressly hold that the Bail Reform Act does not permit a two-tiered bail 
system in which defendants of lesser means are detained pending trial while wealthy 
defendants are released to self-funded private jails. It is a fundamental principle of fairness 
that the law protects 'the interests of rich and poor criminals in equal scale, and its hand 
extends as far to each.' To interpret the Bail Reform Act as requiring district courts to permit 
EFTA00024831
--- PAGE 2 ---
wealthy defendants to employ privately funded armed guards where an otherwise similarly 
situated defendant without means would be detained would violate this core principle. Such 
a two-tiered system would 'foster inequity and unequal treatment in favor of a very small 
cohort of criminal defendants who are extremely wealthy.' 
Slip op. at 7 
The court recognized one potential exception to this principle, i.e., "where the defendant is 
deemed to be a flight risk primarily because of his wealth. In other words, a defendant may 
be released on such a condition only where, but for his wealth, he would not have been 
detained." Id. But it appears that this exception is a narrow one, since the district court in 
Boustani  cited the defendant's wealth as "one of many factors" but "did not rely primarily on 
Boustani's personal wealth in finding that he posed a flight risk." Slip op. at 9. Thus, because 
"[a] similarly situated defendant of lesser means surely would be detained pending trial, ... 
Boustani is not permitted to avoid such a result by relying on his own financial resources to 
pay for a private jail." 
I do not expect that this opinion will be the last word on this issue, but it is now the 
governing law in the Second Circuit.

Defendant-Appellant. 
JOSE A. CABRANES, Circuit Judge: 
Defendant-Appellant Jean Boustani ("Boustani") appeals from 
a March 28, 2019 order of the District Court for the Eastern District of 
New York (William F. Kuntz, II, Judge) denying Boustani's bail 
application and directing that he be detained pending trial. We 
affirmed the District Court's order by order on May 16, 2019. We write 
to explain that decision and to clarify the circumstances under which 
the Bail Reform Act permits a District Court to release a defendant 
pending trial pursuant to a condition under which the defendant 
would pay for private armed security guards. 
I. 
BACKGROUND 
Boustani is charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, in 
violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1343 and 1349; conspiracy to commit 
securities fraud, in violation of 15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b) and 78ff and 18 
U.S.C. §§ 371; and conspiracy to commit money laundering, in 
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a) and (h). 
Boustani filed an application for bail pending trial, proposing a 
set of conditions that included home confinement under the 
supervision of private armed security guards, to be paid for by 
Boustani. The Government opposed Boustani's request and argued 
that he should be detained pending trial because he was a flight risk. 
EFTA00024835
--- PAGE 4 ---
Case 19-1018, Document 61, 08/01/2019. 2621854, Page4 of 10 
The District Court denied Boustani's bail application, and Boustani 
appealed. We affirmed the District Court's order without prejudice to 
further bail applications before the District Court.' Boustani then filed 
another bail application, which the District Court again denied on 
March 28, 2019. Boustani now appeals from the District Court's order 
denying his second bail application. After oral argument on May 14, 
2019, we affirmed the District Court order by order on May 16, 2019. 
II. 
DISCUSSION 
We review a district court's order of detention for clear error 
and will reverse only where "on the entire evidence we are left with 
the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed."2
Under the Bail Reform Act, a court is required to order the 
pretrial release of a defendant on personal recognizance or after 
execution of an appearance bond "unless the judicial officer 
determines that such release will not reasonably assure the 
appearance of the person as required or will endanger the safety of 
any other person or the community."3 If the court finds that a 
defendant poses a risk of flight, it must release him "subject to the 
least restrictive further condition, or combination of conditions,

Case 19-1018, Document 61, 08/01/2019. 2621854, Page5 of 10 
that .. . will reasonably assure the appearance of the person."4 The 
court must order detention, however, if it "finds that no condition or 
combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of 
the person as required and the safety of any other person and the 
community."5 In determining whether any condition or combination 
of conditions is sufficient, a court should consider several factors, 
including: (1) the nature and circumstances of the charged offense; 
(2) the weight of the evidence; (3) the history and characteristics of 
the defendant; and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger 
posed by the defendant's release.' 
The Government bears the burden of proving by a 
preponderance of the evidence both that the defendant "presents an 
actual risk of flight" and that "no condition or combination of 
conditions could be imposed on the defendant that would reasonably 
assure his presence in court."7
We have previously recognized that, in limited circumstances, 
a court may release a defendant subject to conditions of home 
confinement in which, among other things, the defendant pays for 
private armed security guards.' In United States v. Sabhnani, we first

acknowledged that such home confinement, combined with other 
restrictive conditions, may suffice to reasonably assure the 
defendant's appearance in court. We noted in that case, however, 
that we had "no occasion to consider whether it would be contrary to 
principles of detention and release on bail to allow wealthy 
defendants to buy their way out by constructing a private jail."9 We 
observed that the defendants in that case were likely denied bail 
because of their wealth and that defendants of "lesser means . . . 
might have been granted bail in the first place."'° 
Since Sabhnani, however, we have highlighted our concerns 
regarding granting bail to defendants because of their wealth. In non-
precedential summary orders, we have observed that pretrial release 
pursuant to, inter alia, conditions such as supervision by privately 
hired security guards may not be appropriate for wealthy defendants 
when similarly situated defendants of lesser means would be 
detained." And we have noted that district courts need not routinely 
consider "the retention of self-paid private security guards," which

Case 19-1018, Document 61, 08/01/2019. 2621854, Pagel of 10 
may be best understood as "a less onerous form of detention 
available only to the wealthy."12
We now expressly hold that the Bail Reform Act does not 
permit a two-tiered bail system in which defendants of lesser means 
are detained pending trial while wealthy defendants are released to 
self-funded private jails. It is a fundamental principle of fairness that 
the law protects "the interests of rich and poor criminals in equal 
scale, and its hand extends as far to each."'3 To interpret the Bail 
Reform Act as requiring district courts to permit wealthy defendants 
to employ privately funded armed guards where an otherwise 
similarly situated defendant without means would be detained 
would violate this core principle. Such a two-tiered system would 
"foster inequity and unequal treatment in favor of a very small 
cohort of criminal defendants who are extremely wealthy."14 
That said, the private-security condition we described in 
Sabhnani may be appropriate where the defendant is deemed to be a 
flight risk primarily because of his wealth. In other words, a defendant 
may be released on such a condition only where, but for his wealth, 
he would not have been detained. By contrast, if a similarly situated 
defendant of lesser means would be detained, a wealthy defendant

cannot avoid detention by relying on his personal funds to pay for 
private detention. Such a limitation on private-security conditions 
ensures that the standards of the Bail Reform Act are applied 
equitably to all defendants. 
In the instant appeal, Boustani does not challenge the District 
Court's finding that he poses a risk of flight. Instead, he argues that 
the District Court erred in finding that no conditions or combination 
of conditions would reasonably assure his appearance in court. 
In ruling on Boustani's initial bail application, the District 
Court found that he poses a risk of flight based on several factors.15
First, the District Court noted the seriousness of the charged offenses 
and the lengthy possible sentence Boustani would face if convicted.16
Second, without drawing any conclusions about the merits of the 
case, the District Court found that the evidence against Boustani 
"appears strong."17 Third, the Court considered Boustani's personal 
characteristics, including his "alleged deceptive actions, access to 
substantial financial resources, frequent international travel, 
complete lack of ties to the United States, and extensive ties to foreign 
countries without extradition."18 Having evaluated "the totality of

the circumstances," the District Court found that "the Government 
has shown by a preponderance of the evidence" that Boustani poses 
"a serious risk of flight."19
The District Court further found that the Government had 
satisfied its burden of showing that no conditions or combination of 
conditions could reasonably assure Boustani's appearance in court. 
The District Court noted, among other considerations, that releasing 
Boustani to a privately funded jail would lead to disparate treatment 
between him and his co-defendants, who might pose flight risks for 
similar reasons but lack the financial resources available to 
Boustani.2° 
Boustani's amended bail application did not alter the District 
Court's conclusions that Boustani poses a flight risk and that no 
conditions or combination of conditions would reasonably assure his 
appearance in court. 
The District Court's findings are not clearly erroneous. It is 
clear that the District Court did not rely primarily on Boustani's 
personal wealth in finding that he posed a flight risk. Rather, his 
wealth was one of many factors the Court considered. A similarly 
situated defendant of lesser means surely would be detained pending 
trial, and Boustani is not permitted to avoid such a result by relying 
on his own financial resources to pay for a private jail.

Counsel for the MDC may 
submit any objection to 
the Defendant's request by 
May 4, 2021. 
SO ORDERED. 
We write to respectfully request the Court to issue an order to the MDC directing it to 
accept two hard drives from defense counsel that contain the non-Highly Confidential discovery in 
this case for Ms. Maxwell's use at the MDC. 
In an effort to facilitate Ms. Maxwell's review of the discovery, defense counsel have 
created a master set of two hard drives that contain a complete set of the discovery produced by 
the government so far, excluding the materials marked Highly Confidential, which Ms. Maxwell is 
not permitted to possess in the MDC pursuant to the terms of the Protective Order. The master 
drives are easier to use than her existing hard drives because they collect all of the material in one 
place and organize the documents in a more user-friendly format. For example, the November 18, 
2020 production containing roughly 2.2 million pages was produced in load file format, which 
contains images of individual pages of documents in native file format, image file format, and 
other formats. The hard drives organize these files by document, as opposed to by page, and 
eliminate duplicative file formats so that Ms. Maxwell will not have to add countless hours to her 
review. 
Defense counsel would like to send these hard drives to Ms. Maxwell for her to use in the 
MDC. We were informed by the MDC Legal Department that they are only permitted to accept 
hard drives that are loaded and certified by the U.S. Attorney's Office. We have conferred with 
the government, which has advised that it does not object to the defense making an application to 
the Court to issue an order directing the MDC to accept the hard drives. The government 
requested, however, that the Court allow MDC legal counsel the opportunity to note their 
objections to the Court.

Accordingly, we respectfully request that the Court issue an order directing the MDC to 
accept the master hard drives either from defense counsel or from the government. We will send a 
copy of this letter to the MDC Legal Department so that they can note any objections they may 
have. 
Thank you for your attention to this matter.

might be able to get copies from you of the materials you obtained, including the 500,000+ emails and the 15-20,000

Following are some numbers you requested. 
1. 
Total number of email files obtained for the 5 subjects 4 approximately 516,000. 
This does not count attachments (e.g., correspondence, drafts, final documents, press report, etc.) as 
separate files. 
Note that for subjects who left the USAO during the pendency of the Epstein case, there are fewer, 
and that the line AUSA (who remained involved with the CVRA litigation until mid-2019) accounts for 
the vast majority of the files. 
2. 
It is our best ballpark estimate that we determined approximately 3,000 unique emails were directly relevant 
to OPR's investigation, but we certainly considered a larger universe. 
3. 
Our best (most useful) collection of scanned-in USAO hard copy documents is from the CVRA litigation, and 
includes both the production to petitioners (3,754 pages), and a separate collection of privileged 
documents/records (about 15,267 pages) that were submitted to the court (and that remained privileged). 
We also have hundreds of pages of other case documents in both hard copy format and electronically, but 
they are largely duplicative of these two sets and are difficult to quantify. 
We hope this is helpful.

Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1079 Filed 07/29/20 Page 1 of 4 
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
VIRGINIA L. GIUFFRE, 
Plaintiff, 
-against-
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 
Defendant. 
No. 15 Civ. 7433 (LAP) 
MEMORANDUM & ORDER 
LORETTA A. PRESKA, Senior United States District Judge: 
The Court has reviewed Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell's letter 
requesting reconsideration of the Court's July 23, 2020, decision 
to unseal (1) the transcripts of Ms. Maxwell's and Doe l's 
depositions, and (2) court submissions excerpting from, quoting 
from, or summarizing the contents of the transcripts. (See dkt. 
no. 1078.) 
Ms. Maxwell's eleventh-hour request for reconsideration is 
denied. As Ms. Maxwell acknowledges in her letter, reconsideration 
is an "extraordinary remedy." In re Beacon Assocs. Litig., 818 F. 
Supp. 2d 697, 701 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (quoting In re Health Mgmt. Sys. 
Inc. Sec. Litig., 113 F. Supp. 2d 613, 614 (S.D.N.Y. 2000)). Such 
motions "are properly granted only if there is a showing of: (1) 
an intervening change in controlling law; (2) the availability of 
new evidence; or (3) a need to correct a clear error or prevent 
manifest injustice." Drapkin v. Mafco Consol. Grp., Inc., 818 F. 
Supp. 2d 678, 696 (S.D.N.Y. 2011). "A motion for reconsideration 
EFTA00024875
--- PAGE 2 ---
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1079 Filed 07/29/20 Page 2 of 4 
may not be used to advance new facts, issues or arguments not 
previously presented to the Court, nor may it be used as a vehicle 
for relitigating issues already decided by the Court." Bennett v. 
Watson Wyatt & Co., 156 F. Supp.2d 270, 271 (S.D.N.Y. 2001). 
Here, Ms. Maxwell's request for reconsideration hinges on her 
assertion that new developments, i.e., her indictment and arrest, 
provide compelling reasons for keeping the deposition transcripts 
sealed. 
(See dkt. no. 1078 at 5.) 
But, despite Ms. Maxwell's 
contention that she could not address the effect of those events 
in her objections because they occurred after the close of 
briefing, (id.), 1 this is plowed ground. Indeed, in her original 
objection to unsealing, Ms. Maxwell argued that the specter of 
ongoing 
criminal 
investigations 
into 
unknown 
individuals 
associated with Jeffrey Epstein--a group that, of course, includes 
Ms. Maxwell--loomed large over the Court-ordered unsealing 
The Court notes as a practical matter that Ms. Maxwell was 
arrested on July 2, 2020--that is, three weeks prior to the Court's 
July 23 decision to unseal the materials at issue. To the extent 
that they relate to the to the Court's balancing of interests in 
the unsealing process, the issues that Ms. Maxwell raises in her 
request were surely plain the day that Ms. Maxwell was apprehended. 
Ms. Maxwell, however, did not seek to supplement her objections to 
unsealing despite ample time to do so. In fact, the Court notified 
the parties on July 21, 2020, that it would announce the unsealing 
decision with respect to Ms. Maxwell's deposition, together with 
other documents, on July 23. (See dkt. no. 1076.) Even then, Ms. 
Maxwell made no request for delay or to supplement her papers. 
Ms. Maxwell did not raise her "vastly different position," 
(Transcript of July 23 Ruling at 16:2-3), until moments after the 
Court had made its decision to unseal the relevant documents. 
EFTA00024876
--- PAGE 3 ---
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1079 Filed 07/29/20 Page 3 of 4 
process. (See dkt. no. 1057 at 5.) This argument, specifically 
Ms. Maxwell's concern that unsealing would "inappropriately 
influence potential witnesses or alleged victims," (id.), and her 
reference 
to "publicly 
reported 
statements 
by 
Plaintiff, 
Plaintiff's counsel, 
District of New York, 
Islands" about those 
the United States Attorney for the Southern 
and the Attorney General for the U.S. Virgin 
investigations, (id.), carried with it the 
clear implication that Ms. Maxwell could find herself subject to 
investigation and, eventually, indictment. The Court understood 
that implication as applying to Ms. Maxwell and thus has already 
considered any role that criminal charges against Ms. Maxwell might 
play in rebutting the presumption of public access to the sealed 
materials. 
Ms. Maxwell's request for reconsideration of the 
Court's July 23 ruling is accordingly denied. 
Given the Court's denial of Ms. Maxwell's request for 
reconsideration, the Court will stay the unsealing of Ms. Maxwell's 
and Doe l's deposition transcripts and any sealed or redacted order 
or paper that quotes from or discloses information from those 
deposition transcripts for two business days, i.e., through 
Friday, July 31, 2020, so that Ms. Maxwell may seek relief from 
the Court of Appeals. Any sealed materials that do not quote from 
or disclose 
unsealed on 
Order dated 
information from those deposition transcripts shall be 
July 30, 2020, in the manner described by the Court's 
July 28, 2020. (See dkt. no. 1077.) Ms. Maxwell's and

I apologize about not getting back with you. I thought the other attorney that filed the response was going to do so. 
Regardless, the response included everything that Interlochen has. They only keep tuition payment information for 7 
years and nothing in their files reflects any payments by Epstein or Epstein entities.

Thank you both very much for your assistance in response to our subpoenas seeking records from Interlochen. In 
reviewing the documents you produced in response to the attached subpoena, a follow-up question arose. Would 
you please confirm that your production included all records of any tuition payments that Epstein (or his entities) 
made for any students at Interlochen? 
Our team is also happy to discuss this inquiry over the phone if that would be useful. I am starting a trial tomorrow 
and will have limited availability this week, but my colleagues 
and

able to coordinate with you as needed.

Good afternoon Bobbi: 
We have receive your concerns and will be looking in to these matters. 
All concerns will be properly addressed as needed. 
Best, 
>>> BOBBI C STERNHEIM ‹
> 1/6/2021 2:38 AM >>> 
Counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell learned that she has been issued a 
disciplinary charge. Please provide a copy of the Incident Report. 
Members of the same team who physically mistreated and threatened Ms. 
Maxwell on Sunday now claim that she is not tidy (See email below.) 
The basis of the charge is unclear - because Ms. Maxwell has not 
deviated from her routine of the past 7 months. But the fact that it 
comes after Ms. Maxwell and counsel made complaints 
about staff is concerning, disturbing, and questionable. 
The policy of rotating in staff from other institutions has contributed 
to lack of consistency and clarity in the management of Ms. Maxwell. One 
team tells her one thing which is then contradicted by another team. 
One team tells her she can't keep books in her locker; another team 
tells her to put books in her locker. One team tells her to keep a set 
of clothes in her isolation cell; another team faults her for doing so. 
Ms. Maxwell's request for guidance is met with a terse response: "Read 
the A&O handbook." 
Ms. Maxwell cannot ask other inmates for help and is at the mercy of 
guards who appear to delight is their power over her. The present team 
was particularly harsh during a previous rotation and seem to have 
increased their contempt for Ms. Maxwell. 
Ms. Maxwell- and counsel- are concerned for her safety while in the 
custody of the present team. 
In lieu of an opportunity for Ms. Maxwell to be moved to another unit, 
and the unlikelihood that she would be 
transferred to the MCC as a result of Epstein's death while BOP was 
"asleep" on the watch, we are requesting that the present team be 
removed from guarding Ms. Maxwell. 
Issues still remain concerning Ms. Maxwell's meals.She still is not 
receiving items on the menu. 
Yesterday, she received the same meal for lunch and dinner. Tuesday 
morning she was given an inedible black and rotting banana. Over the 
weekend she was given bologna, despite being on a non-flesh diet. The 
guard informed her that the meat had not been refrigerated and 
recommended that she not eat it. 
The MDC's inability to provide proper nutrition is reoccurring and 
EFTA00024888
--- PAGE 2 ---
problematic. 
The problems keep escalating, giving rise to the belief that Ms. 
Maxwell is being targeted and victimized. I urge you to address and 
correct these problems. The failure to do so will 
result in a request for court intervention.

Before circulating this shortly, just wanted to check to see if any other orders or info worth including have 
happened between Wednesday and today? Thanks! 
UNITED STATES ATTORNEY'S OFFICE 
Southern District of New York 
PRESS GUIDANCE 
Friday, November 26, 2021 
*ADDITIONAL OFF-THE-RECORD GUIDANCE: Please note the Court has ruled that several of the 
government's witnesses, who are not alleged victims themselves, may testify under pseudonyms because the 
disclosure of their identities would ostensibly reveal the identities of the alleged victims. I believe most, if not 
all, news media outlets have a policy against identifying sex crime victims without their consent, and again 
urge you to abide by that policy with our witnesses and respect their privacy. 
If convicted, Ghislaine Maxwell faces the following statutory maximum penalties; however, her sentence would 
ultimately be at the sole discretion of the judge: 
■ Count One: conspiracy to entice a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which 
carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; 
■ Count Two: enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a 
maximum sentence of five years in prison; 
■ Count Three: conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal 
sexual activity, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison; 
EFTA00024892
--- PAGE 2 ---
• Count Four: transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, 
which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison; 
• Count Five: conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors, which carries a statutory 
maximum of 40 years in prison; and 
• Count Six: sex trafficking of minors, which carries a statutory maximum of five years in 
prison. 
A trial logistics order from Judge Nathan is also attached. 
UNITED STATES ATTORNEY'S OFFICE 
Southern District of New York 
PRESS GUIDANCE 
Tuesday, November 23, 2021 
*OFF-THE-RECORD,  AND FOR GUIDANCE ONLY: Several of the government's anticipated witnesses 
will be testifying in this trial using a pseudonym or first name. The Court granted a Government motion 
/attacked/ requesting that they be able to do so, because the victim witnesses are expected to describe alleged 
sensitive, explicit and personal events concerning illegal sexual abuse, sexual contact and other acts of which 
they have been victims. I believe most, if not all, news media outlets have a policy against identifying sex 
crime victims without their consent, and urge you to abide by that policy with our witnesses and respect their 
privacy. 
9:30 a.m. — Final pretrial conference U.S. v. Ghislaine Maxwell — the defendant is charged in connection to 
conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein to entice minors to travel to engage in criminal sexual activity — before Judge 
Alison Nathan (Courtroom 318, 40 Foley Square [overflow Courtrooms 110, 506, 905, and 906 of the Thurgood 
Marshall U.S. Courthouse]). 
EXHIBITS: Government exhibits will be provided exclusively through the SDNY file share. If you are unable 
to access this link to the file share (USAFx), you must establish an account to access the files. To establish an 
account, request access by email to me or my colleague, Jim Margolin, Cc'd here, prior to Monday, November 
29, 2021. 
Please also note that all case filings in U.S. v. Maxwell are available in the Court's electronic filing system; we 
encourage media representatives to establish a free PACER account, if they have not done so already. 
Credentialing and other matters relating to in-person attendance for the trial are handled by the SDNY District

do the right thing. At this trial, brave women will take the witness stand and the truth will come out: Ghislaine Maxwell

Would you mind adding these emails to

Also, one of the emails has some attachments that we should produce in Rule 16 if we haven't already. Would you mind 
de-duping or having someone de-dupe them? We're not sure if we already received these from Interlochen.

Regarding the list of numbers to be queried in Relativity I've completed the first 4. There are several "hits" but not all are 
exact matches and need to be sorted through. 
I organized the info in a Word Doc reflecting results under the first section US vs Epstein as "JE" and the second part with 
the search warrants as "JE SW". Each positive match has the control number and a brief description of what it consists of. 
As I continue to work on it I will send it with updated results.

Good afternoon-
In our 4/22 letter, we provided specific details concerning cases and trial dates 
to justify our request for a continuance to 11/8. 
Beyond a vague statement regarding consideration of availability of witnesses and counsel, 
you have provided no specific details why the government cannot proceed to trial on 11/8. 
Starting the trial on 11/29 - besides disrupting Thanksgiving holiday plans - will push the trial 
to the end of the year and possibly into the new year, interfering with Christmas and 
New Year's plans, as COVID did last year. This will cast the defense and defense case 
in a negative light as jurors impatiently wait for the trial to conclude before Christmas, which it won't. 
Our previous email explained our reasons for firmly pressing the 11/8 trial date, 
but as an accommodation, we would consider starting on 11/15, but no later. 
For now, we will not agree to exclusion of speedy trial time beyond 11/8. 
These scheduling conflicts can be easily eliminated by consenting to bail for Ms. Maxwell. 
It is unclear why the scheduling order, which contemplated a continuance, should be altered. 
As previously discussed and raised with the Court, we need to review of 3500 material 
and exhibits before determining the need to call any experts. 
Enjoy the day.

Thanks very much for letting us know your availability. Regarding the trial date, after considering the availability of 
witnesses and counsel, we plan to propose a trial date of November 29, 2021. Could you please let us know your 
position regarding that date, so that we can include it in our letter to the Court? In addition, please let us know 
whether you consent to an exclusion of time under the Speedy Trial Act between now and the new trial date the 
Court selects. 
With respect to other scheduling matters, we intend to propose that the Court set a deadline of three months before 
trial for the Government to disclose the identities of victims referenced in the indictment; this is an earlier proposal 
than the timeframe we had originally proposed for the July trial date. We also intend to propose that the deadline 
for defense expert disclosures be set for two months before trial, given the substantial length of the adjournment. 
Please let us know your position regarding those proposed dates and we'll include it in our letter. 
Thanks very much, and hope everyone has a nice weekend--

Thanks for your response. Your April 22, 2021 letter does not address the defense's availability for trial dates after 
November 8th, and it would be helpful to get a complete picture of available dates throughout the balance of 
2021 in order to provide the Court with comprehensive information. We're still in the process of conferring with

Following up on this actually, I just spoke with 
who is requesting courtroom connect for 
(and he did for NCAA 
also). He said that getting courtroom connect is not going to happen without a signed order from the judge. He 
recommended getting it submitted sooner rather than later to leave time for logistics to be worked out. Would it be 
possible to submit a proposed order and request to Judge Nathan soon, tonight or tomorrow? I've drafted one (attached) 
using the language • used in his, which I forwarded below. Let me know what you think or if you need anything from me, 
thanks.

FYI, I am going to check in with 
tomorrow about the procedure for courtroom connect internet (I flagged it for 
her yesterday but forgot to check in this afternoon), but it looks like we will need to send a letter and proposed order to 
the judge to approve it before coordinating with the tech folks who install and make it happen. If this is in fact what we 
need to do, which I'll again check with 
about tomorrow, I think we should try and send such a letter/proposed 
order tomorrow (to ideally get it approved as soon as possible and a tech check scheduled for before Thanksgiving).

Honorable Alison J. Nathan 
United States District Judge 
United States Courthouse 
Foley Square 
New York, NY 10007 
Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell 
S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
USDC SONY 
DOCUMENT 
ELECTRONICALLY FILED 
DOC 0: 
DATE FILED: 4/29/21 
During oral argument of Ghislaine Maxwell's bail appeal before the Circuit, Ms. 
Maxwell's appellate counsel expressed concern that she was improperly deprived of sleep while 
detained in the MDC, an issue that has been raised in filings before this Court. In its brief denial 
of her appeal, the Circuit stated: "To the extent Appellant seeks relief specific to her sleeping 
conditions, such request should be addressed to the District Court." See Exhibit A. We press our 
concerns regarding disruption of Ms. Maxwell's sleep and the deleterious effect sleep 
deprivation is having on her health, well-being, and ability to prepare for and withstand trial. 
Ms. Maxwell continues to be disrupted throughout the night by guards shining a 
flash/strobe light into her cell, claiming that her breathing must be checked. The myth that Ms. 
Maxwell's conditions of confinement are related to her being a suicide risk was laid to rest 
during the oral argument: There is nothing to support that contrived claim. In fact, Ms. Maxwell 
is classified with the standard CC1-Mh designation: inmate with no significant mental health 
care. (See Dkt. 159 at 3.) 
Contrary to the report that Ms. Maxwell "wears an eye mask when she sleeps" (Dkt. 196 
at 4), an item neither available for purchase through MDC commissary nor provided to her, she 
resorts to using a sock or towel to cover her eyes in an awkward attempt to shield them from 
disrupting illumination every 15 minutes. Last night, she was confronted by MDC staff due a 
visible bruise over her left eye. The "black eye" is depicted in Exhibit B. Despite 24/7 camera 
surveillance (except when guards elect to exert authority in an intimidating way off-camera, as 
they did in Saturday's bathroom incident), no guard addressed the bruise until Ms. Maxwell, who 
has no mirror, caught a reflection of her aching eye in the glean of a nail clipper. At that point, 
MDC staff confronted Ms. Maxwell regarding the source of the bruise, threatening to place her 
in the SHU if she did not reveal how she got it. While Ms. Maxwell is unaware of the cause of 
the bruise, as reported to medical and psych staff, she has grown increasingly reluctant to report 
information to the guards for fear of retaliation, discipline, and punitive chores. However, there 
is concern that the bruise may be related to the need for Ms. Maxwell to shield her eyes from the 
lights projected into her cell throughout the night. 
EFTA00024928
--- PAGE 2 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 256 Filed 04/29/21 Page 2 of 4 
LAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIM 
The MDC routinely places inmates in the SHU if they have engaged in physical 
altercation with other inmates or to protect inmates who are the subject of abuse. It would be 
ironic if the MDC follows through with its threat to place Ms. Maxwell in the SHU: It would 
signal that Ms. Maxwell needs protection from the very staff so intent on protecting her, since 
she has no contact with anyone but staff. 
As suggested by the Circuit, we ask the Court to address Ms. Maxwell's sleeping 
conditions by directing the MDC to cease 15-minute light surveillance of Ms. Maxwell or 
justify the need for the disruptive flashlight surveillance. 
Very truly yours, 
ga 
C. cle.m444t. 
BOBBI C. STERNHEIM 
Encs. 
cc: All counsel of record 
By May 5, 2021, the Government is ORDERED to 
confer with MDC legal counsel and provide the 
Court responses to the following questions: 
1. Is Ms. Maxwell being subjected to flashlight 
surveillance every 15 minutes at night? Or 
any other atypical flashlight surveillance? 
2. If so, what is the basis for doing so? 
3. And if so, can she be provided with 
appropriate eye covering? 
The Government is further ORDERED to share its 
response with defense counsel before filing it on 
ECF so that defense counsel can indicate whether 
they believe any private medical information needs 
to be redacted before public filing. 
SO ORDERED.

Glen, 
We will be joined by two FBI agents who are focusing on the CBP topics that we have previously discussed. I expect one 
of those agents will take the lead on questioning Mr. 
The topics we expect to cover include: 
• The identities of any CBP employees Mr. 
recalls interacting with Jeffrey Epstein in the Virgin Islands. 
• Any steps Mr. 
recalls any CBP employees in the Virgin Islands taking to help Epstein and those traveling with 
Epstein to enter the country, including any steps that allowed Epstein or those traveling with him to avoid 
processing that travelers would normally undergo. 
• Any favors Mr. 
recalls Epstein doing for CBP employees in the Virgin Islands, such as trips to Epstein's island.

Thanks very much, Glen. Let's plan for 1pm on Thursday, 11/12. I will circulate a WebEx invitation shortly. 
We expect to ask Mr. 
about his interactions with 
employee who worked in Saint Thomas and who had Mr. 
listed as a contact in his phone. I expect we will ask for 
an approximate timeline of when Mr. 
met and interacted with 
the nature of those interactions, and any 
interactions 
may have had with Epstein (to the best of Mr. 
knowledge).

WebEx. Are there any days the week of November 9th when your team and Mr.

Thanks for sending the WebEx invitation for Wednesday's meeting to me. For whatever reason, the system is not 
permitting me to forward the invite, so I would ask that you separately invite those copied on this e-mail: Dan, Danielle 
and Mr 
but also Josh Morrissey who is in our IT group and will make sure we are good to go for our meeting. 
Thanks,

We will be joined by two FBI agents who are focusing on the CBP to
 that we have previously discussed. I 
expect one of those agents will take the lead on questioning Mr. 
. The topics we expect to cover include: 
* The identities of.viCBP employees Mr. 
recalls interacting with Jeffrey Epstein in the Virgin Islands. 
* Any steps Mr. 
recalls any CBP employees in the Virgin Islands taking to help Epstein and those 
traveling with Epstein to enter the country, including any steps that allowed Epstein or those traveling with him 
to avoid processin that ravelers would normally undergo. 
* Any favors Mr. 
recalls Epstein doing for CBP employees in the Virgin Islands, such as trips to 
Epstein's island. 
Thanks,

Sony for the delay. Looks like we can do between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. on Tuesday, 11/10, or any time on 
Thursday, 11/12. Let us know if anything in that range will work. 
So as to make sure Mr. 
is prepared, can you give us an overview of what you expect to cover? 
Thanks,

Glen, 
As I believe we mentioned when we last spoke, we would like to schedule time for a second interview with Mr. 
via WebEx. Are there any days the week of November 9th when your team and Mr. 
would be 
available? We would expect this proffer to be much shorter than our first, and certainly no more than two hours 
at most. 
Thanks,

Subject: Wednesday's WebEx 
Thanks for sending the WebEx invitation for Wednesday's meeting to me. For whatever reason, the system is not 
permitting me to forward the invite, so I would ask that you separately invite those copied on this e-mail: Dan, 
Danielle and Mr. 
but also Josh Morrissey who is in our IT group and will make sure we are good to go 
for our meeting. 
Thanks, 
Glen

--- PAGE 3 ---
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 
The defendant has notified the Government that she plans to call six additional experts. 
One of them, Dr. Ryan Hall, 
and drafted a lengthy report, containing largely a recitation of hearsay, attributing some but not all 
o 
Another, Bennett 
Gershman, is a purported expert on prosecutorial misconduct. Neither of these issues is relevant 
at trial. and both experts should be precluded. 
The defendant has failed to provide adequate notice as to the four remaining experts. 
Instead of describing those experts' opinions and the bases for them, as required by Rule 16, the 
notice identifies topics on which the experts might testify. The Government is therefore not able 
to interpose a Dauber: challenge at this time.' The Court should require the defense to provide 
supplemental expert notice forthwith or preclude these witnesses from testifying. 
I. 
APPLICABLE LAW 
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16(b)(1)(C) provides that where, as here, the 
Government has provided expert notice and requested reciprocal notice from the defense, the 
defendant "must . . . give to the government a written summary of any [expert] testimony that 
the defendant intends to use ... as evidence at trial." Such summary must "describe the witness's 
opinions, the bases and reasons for those opinions, and the witness's qualifications." Fed. R. 
As described below, however, insofar as two of these witnesses will testify as fact witnesses 
related to computer forensics and financial records, the Government does not object to their 
testimony on Dauber: grounds. 
EFTA00024956
--- PAGE 4 ---
Crim. P. 16(b)(1)(C). 
As the 1993 amendments to Rule 16 note, the Rule is meant to "minimize surprise that 
often results from unexpected expert testimony, reduce the need for continuances, and to provide 
the opponent with a fair opportunity to test the merit of the expert's testimony through focused 
cross-examination." Id. 1993 Amend. Accordingly, the Rule requires the defense to provide 
(1) "notice of the expert's qualifications which in turn will permit the requesting party to 
determine whether in fact the witness is an expert within the definition of Federal Rule of 
Evidence 702;" (2) a "summary of the expected testimony," which "pennit[s] more complete 
pretrial preparation by the requesting party;" and (3) "a summary of the bases of the expert's 
opinion." Id. 
The content of the expert notice must actually "summarize the experts' opinions." 
United States v. Ulbricht, 858 F.3d 71, 115 (2d Cir. 2017), abrogated on other grounds by 
Carpenter v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 2206 (2018). "Merely identifying the general topics about 
which the expert will testify is insufficient; rather, the summary must reveal the expert's actual 
opinions." United States v. Valle, No. 12 Cr. 847 (PGG), 2013 WL 440687, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. 
Feb. 2, 2013); see Ulbricht, 858 F.3d at 115 (calling "plainly inadequate" a disclosure that 
"listed general and in some cases extremely broad topics on which the experts might opine"). 
The notice then must describe the bases and reasons for those opinions. "[A] general description 
of possible bases does not meet the requirements of Rule 16(b)(1)(C)." United States v. Tuzman, 
2017 WL 6527261, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 18, 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted). 
"Merely asserting that [an expert] will provide [an] opinion based on some unspecified method 
. .. based on data from unspecified sources, does not suffice." United States v. Ulbricht, No. 14 
EFTA00024957
--- PAGE 5 ---
Cr. 68 (KBF), 2015 WL 413318, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 1, 2015), aff'd, Ulbricht, 858 F.3d 71. A 
district court has "broad discretion" over the remedy for failure to comply with Rule 16, 
including "ordering the exclusion of evidence." Ulbricht, 858 F.3d at 115 (internal quotation 
marks omitted). 
As the Court is well aware, a properly noticed expert witness may then testify if such 
testimony complies with Federal Rule of Evidence 702. Accordingly, before admitting expert 
testimony, the Court must conclude that (1) the witness is qualified to be an expert, (2) the 
proposed expert testimony is reliable, and (3) the proposed testimony is relevant. See Dauber! 
v. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 592 (1993); Nimely v. City of New York, 414 F.3d 
381, 396 n.11 (2d Cir. 2005). "Expert testimony which does not relate to any issue in the case 
is not relevant and, ergo, non-helpful." Daubers, 509 U.S. at 591 (internal quotation marks 
omitted). The party that proffers the testimony bears the burden of showing that it is admissible 
by a preponderance of the evidence. See id. at 592 & n.10 (citing Bout-Oily v. United States, 
483 U.S. 171, 175-76 (1987)). 
Rules 401 and 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence state that relevant evidence is 
admissible when it tends to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence more or less 
probable than it would be without the evidence, but it may be excluded if its probative value is 
substantially outweighed by, among other things, the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the 
issues, and misleading the jury. "Expert evidence can be both powerful and quite misleading 
because of the difficulty in evaluating it. Because of this risk, the judge in weighing possible 
prejudice against probative force under Rule 403 . .. exercises more control over experts than over 
lay witnesses." Daubers, 509 U.S. at 595 (quoting authority omitted). Among other things, the 
EFTA00024958
--- PAGE 6 ---
Court "must consider whether an expert's proposed testimony would usurp the province of the 
judge to instruct on the law, or of the jury to make factual determinations." Island Intel!. Prop. 
LLC v. Deutsche Bank AG, No. 09 Civ. 2675 (KBF), 2012 WL 526722, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 14, 
2012) (citations omitted). 
II. 
THE COURT SHOULD PRECLUDE THE TESTIMONY OF DR. RYAN HALL 
Dr. Ryan Hall is a psychiatrist who frequently testifies as an expert witness. 
. According to the notice 
provided by the defendant, Dr. Hall "will offer the opinions and diagnoses contained in hisM 
report, the bases for those opinions, and the significance of the diagnoses and opinions." (Ex. A, 
Def. Expert Notice, at 12).2
This Court should exclude Dr. Hall's testimony. As disclosed, his expert opinion= 
have no relevance, because none bears on the facts of this case or Minor Victim-4's 
credibility. Any basis for those opinions is therefore also irrelevant. Similarly, absent some as-
yet-undisclosed relevance, the "significance" of Dr. Hall's opinio 
have no bearing 
here: Because none of those opinions bear on the facts of this case or a witness's credibility, their 
introduction would sent 0111 
Dr. Hall's proffered fact testimony should also be 
The Government has attached, and moves to file, the same redacted version of the defendant's 
expert notice attached to its previous filings (See Dkt. Nos. 418 and 424). 
EFTA00024959
--- PAGE 7 ---
excluded. Much of it would constitute hearsay, and the small portion that may not would run afoul 
of other rules of evidence. 
A. Dr. Hall's Opinions 
Are Irrelevant 
The Government moves to redact portions of this brief and seal Exhibit B, which is Dr. Hall's 
evaluation of Minor Victim-4, in accordance with the three-part test articulated by the Second 
Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Although this brief 
and the attached exhibit are judicial documents subject to the common law presumption of access, 
because this brief discusses apsychiatric evaluation of Minor Victim-4 contained in Exhibit B, 
consisting throughout o 
these 
redactions and sealing requests are narrowly tailored to protect her privacy interest. 
EFTA00024960
--- PAGE 8 ---
Dr. Hall's conclusion on this issue should thus be excluded 
to avoid "confusing the issues," as well as causing "undue delay," and "wasting time." Fed. R. 
Evid. 403; see United States v. Blum, 62 F.3d 63, 68 (2d Cir. 1995) (assessing whether evidence 
would result in "confusing the issues" under Rule 403 by asking whether it would bear upon, or 
distract from, "the central issue" of the defendant's "guilt or innocence"); United States v. 
Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 313 (2d Cir. 2006) (upholding preclusion of evidence that would have 
necessitated a "mini-trial").

--- PAGE 14 ---
B. The Bases of Dr. Hall's Opinions Are Not Independently Admissible 
According to the defendant's expert notice, she also seeks to elicit the "bases" for the 
opinions in Dr. Haleeport. 
Because those opinions themselves should not be admitted for 
the reasons just discussed, there is no ground to admit their basis. 
To start, all the summarized information about Minor Victim-4's past is hearsay or 
otherwise inadmissible. Dr. Hall was obviously not a percipient witness to any of the conduct 
discussed in his report, and instead derived his understanding of Minor Victim-4's past from out-
of-court statements by Minor Victim-4 and othe 
EFTA00024967
--- PAGE 15 ---
In any event, no information about the bases of Dr. Hall's opinions can satisfy the 
requirements of Rule 703. Pursuant to that Rule, although an expert may rely on hearsay in 
forming his opinion, the "expert may not, however, simply transmit that hearsay to the jury." 
United States v. Mejia, 545 F.3d 179, 197 (2d Cir. 2008). Instead, "if facts or data would otherwise 
be inadmissible, the proponent of the opinion may disclose them to the jury only if their probative 
value in helping the jury evaluate the opinion substantially outweighs their prejudicial effect." See 
Fed. R. Evid. 703. Here, the probative value of relaying the hearsay would be essentially nil:. 
EFTA00024968
--- PAGE 16 ---
C. Any Undisclosed Significance of Dr. Hall's Opinions Is Inadmissible 
In addition to testifying abou 
As discussed above, to the extent his 
2009 report discloses the significance of his opinions, for purposes of this case they have none, 
because nothing in the report concerns the elements of or defenses to the charged offenses, or 
Minor Victim-4's ability to testify accurately. (See supra at 5 to 11). And to the extent Dr. Hall 
would testify about any undisclosed significance to his opinions, the failure to disclose that 
testimony itself renders it inadmissible. 
The party proposing to call an expert must provide "a written summary of any testimony 
that the defendant intends to use." Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(b)(1)(C). The Rule requires that the expert 
disclose what his testimony will be, not just the topics about which he will testify. See United 
States v. Valle, No. 12 Cr. 847 (PGG), 2013 WL 440687, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 2, 2013) ("Merely 
EFTA00024969
--- PAGE 17 ---
identifying the general topics about which the expert will testify is insufficient; rather, the 
summary must reveal the expert's actual opinions."); United States v. Duvall, 272 F.3d 825, 828 
(7th Cir. 2001) ("The Rule requires a summary of the expected testimony, not a list of topics."). 
"Proper expert disclosures are not a mere technicality with which compliance may be made or 
not—they are required by Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure" and the 
requirements "do not only apply to one side and not the other." United States v. Ulbricht, No. 14 
Cr. 
Such a belated disclosure may require a Daubert 
hearing to test the reliability of Dr. Hall's heretofore unrevealed analysis on this question. But as 
the record now stands, because Dr. Hall's expert opinions are irrelevant without the addition of 
some undisclosed significance, his testimony should be excluded. See Ulbricht, 2015 WL 413318, 
at *5 (collecting cases concerning the exclusion of expert testimony for insufficient notice).8
D. Dr. Hall's Fact Testimony Is Inadmissible 
The defendant's disclosure states that, in addition to providing his expert opinions and their 
basis, Dr. Hall would testify about 
g 
To the extent the defendant is aware of additional conclusions Dr. Hall would offer, those 
should be disclosed immediately—both because without such disclosures his opinions have no 
apparent relevance, and because even the current disclosures are vague yet disclosed relatively 
close to trial. See, e.g., Valle, 2013 WL 440687, at *6 (ordering rapid supplemental disclosure). 
EFTA00024970
--- PAGE 18 ---
If Dr. Hall had some admissible substantive 
testimony, the Government would not object to a foundational account of how he evaluated Minor 
Victim-4. The defendant has not, however, identified any admissible substantive testimony from 
Dr. 
This Court has discretion, after careful consideration of alternatives, to exclude Dr. Hall's 
testimony based solely on the inadequacy of the defendant's disclosures and the lateness of any 
supplemental disclosures. See Ulbricht, 858 F. 3d at 116-17 (affirming district court's exclusion 
of two defense experts on those grounds). 
EFTA00024971
--- PAGE 19 ---
EFTA00024972
--- PAGE 20 ---
It remains theoretically possible that Dr. Hall's interview with Minor Victim-4 will become 
relevant for impeaching her with a prior inconsistent statement. At present, however, the 
Government does not expect that Minor Victim-4's testimony will be contradicted by statements 
she made to Dr. Hall. And to be clear, Minor Victim-4's expected testimony about the defendant's 
involvement in Epstein's scheme is not inconsistent with the fact that Minor Victim-4 did not 
describe those instances to Dr. Hall. "It is well settled that for two statements to be inconsistent, 
they need not be diametrically opposed. Nevertheless, the statements must be inconsistent." 
United States v. Tizaska, 111 F.3d 1019, 1024-25 (2d Cir. 1997) (citations and internal quotation 
marks omitted). In Tnaska, the Circuit explained that a witness's statement on one occasion that 
his son was willing to give away certain guns was not inconsistent with the witness's statement on 
another occasion that his son was obsessed with different guns, or guns in general. Id. Similarly, 
that Minor Victim-4 described to Dr. Hall certain aspects of Epstein's abuse that did not involve 
the defendant is not inconsistent with describing other aspects that did involve the defendant. 
In addition, the defendant does not need Dr. Hall's testimony to inform the jury that Minor 
Victim-4 has not always disclosed the defendant's role in Epstein's abuse. Minor Victim-4 also 
failed to mention the full extent of the defendant's role during her first FBI interview. Because 
the Government believes that in this interview—unlike the Hall interview—Minor Victim-4 was 
asked questions that would have referenced the defendant in a complete answer, the Government 
EFTA00024973
--- PAGE 21 ---
expects to elicit the failure to mention her on direct, and does not object to reasonable cross 
examination on the subject. 
It may nonetheless be that after Minor Victim-4 testifies the defendant will be able to argue 
that some statement made to Dr. Hall satisfies the multiple prerequisites for introducing extrinsic 
evidence of a prior inconsistent statement. See generally United States v. Ghailani, 761 F. Supp. 
2d 114, 117-19 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (discussing requirements). 10 As the Court has noted, any 
argument on that score must await the presentation of evidence. (See Nov. II, 2021 Sealed Tr., at 
194). But at present, the defendant has identified no relevant fact testimony that Dr. Hall could 
offer. Because his expert testimony is similarly inadmissible, he should be excluded as a witness 
absent further developments at trial. 
To be clear, although Dr. Hall could conceivably testify as to his recollection of some prior 
inconsistent statement by Minor Victim-4, the rough transcript of his interview with her cannot 
become admissible as extrinsic evidence of Minor Victim-4's statements regardless how she 
testifies. That label—"rough transcript"—comes from the document itself. (3505-035, at 1). And 
it is i uite obviousl rou h. The document contains numerous errors, includin on material oints. 
Because the rough transcript is not a verbatim transcnpt, rt cannot be offered as extrinsic 
evidence of prior inconsistent statements. See United States v. illmonte, 956 F.2d 27, 29 (2d Cir. 
1992) (per curiam) ("[A] 'third party's characterization' of a witness's statement does not 
constitute a prior statement of that witness unless the witness has subscribed to that 
characterization."); United States v. Leonardi, 623 F.2d 746, 757 (2d Cir. 1980) (FBI notes offered 
to impeach not attributable to witness because "a witness may not be charged with a third party's 
characterization of his statements unless the witness has subscribed to them"); see also Ghailani, 
761 F. Supp. 2d at 117-18, 120 (excluding testimony about prior witness interviews offered as 
prior inconsistent statements due to, among other things, concerns about translation errors).

III. 
THE COURT SHOULD PRECLUDE THE TESTIMONY OF BENNETT 
GERSHMAN 
The defense proposes to call Bennett Gershman, a professor of law at Pace University, for 
the following testimony: 
We expect Professor Gershman to provide testimony on best 
practices to ensure the integrity of any prosecution, focusing on 
investigation, witness preparation, media contact, neutrality, 
obligations to provide accurate information, and relationship 
with crime victims, their counsel, and case-related civil 
litigation. 
(Ex. A at 12). 
This testimony should be precluded as irrelevant. At the conference on November 1, 2021, 
the Court precluded "affirmative evidence by the defense that goes to the thoroughness of the 
investigation," (11/01/21 Tr. at 17:15-17), including "evidence of the public outcry and scrutiny 
that preceded the decision to charge the defendant," (id. at 21:1-9), as well as evidence regarding 
"why and when the government conducted the investigation," including any defense evidence that 
the Government "has a legally improper motive for prosecuting [the defendant] or somehow [is] 
fabricating evidence or suborning perjury or the like," (id. at 23:2-6). The Court reaffirmed the 
settled law in this Circuit that "the government is not on trial." (Id. at 23:10-11 (quoting United 
States v. Knox, 687 F. App'x 51 (2d Cir. 2017))). To the extent evidence similar to this evidence 
is permissible, the Court concluded that it was permitted only as "relevant cross-examination of 
the government's witnesses." (Id. at 27:19-29:24). 
Gershman's proposed testimony is relevant only to the defense theories that the Court has 
precluded. This testimony invites the jury to conclude that either the New York investigation or 
Florida investigation—or both—lacked "integrity." (Ex. A at 12). Whether that supposed lack of 
EFTA00024975
--- PAGE 23 ---
"integrity" goes to an argument about thoroughness, or an argument about motive and the 
corruption of evidence, the Court has already ruled that the defense may not offer affirmative 
evidence of that point to the jury. 
Even if this testimony was not plainly barred by the Court's prior ruling, it should still be 
precluded for inadequate notice. The expert notice for this witness provides only general topics of 
discussion and not Gershman's opinions, and it does not identify the bases for his testimony—
which are independent reasons to preclude Gershman or to require supplemental notice. It is likely 
that such information would demonstrate the unreliability or further irrelevance of Gershman's 
testimony. In a recent case, however, Gershman attempted to offer precisely the sort of testimony 
that this Court has already excluded. See US. Securities and Exchange Comm'n v. Collector's 
Coffee Inc., -- F. Supp. 3d --, 19 Civ. 4355 (VM) (GWG), 2021 WL 3418829, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. 
Aug. 5, 2021) (excluding Gershman's testimony in a civil case that, inter alio, "the SEC 
improperly obtained an ex parte order from the Court," and "the SEC's lawyers have `engaged in 
a pattern of irregular, overzealous, unethical, and unlawful conduct' throughout this litigation"). 
The Court should not permit expert testimony on those subjects. 
IV. 
BEFORE THE DEFENDANT'S REMAINING WITNESSES OFFER EXPERT 
TESTIMONY, THE DEFENDANT SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE 
SUPPLEMENTAL NOTICE 
The defense provided brief notice of four additional experts: Robert Kelso, who would 
testify about computer forensics; 
who would testify about financial records; and two 
forensic document specialists. The defendant's expert notice is not clear regarding these witness's 
expected testimony and the bases for that testimony. Insofar as Kelso and 
will testify as 
fact witnesses, the Government does not object to that testimony. If they are expected to testify as 
EFTA00024976
--- PAGE 24 ---
experts, however, and before any testimony by the forensic document specialists, the defense must 
say more about these witnesses' opinions and the bases for them. The Government is not able to 
take a position on the reliability or relevance of those opinions from the face of the expert notice. 
Given the proximity to trial, any additional delay to provide sufficient notice should be closely 
scrutinized by the Court, and entirely precluded if notice is not provided forthwith. 
A. Robert Kelso and 
The defendant anticipates calling Robert Kelso, a computer forensics specialist, to testify 
about: 
the user data associated with certain devices seized and 
searched by the government's team in this case, documents 
and photographs extracted from certain of those devices, and 
the metadata associated with certain documents and 
photographs. He may also testify generally about computer 
forensic principles associated with the creation of documents, 
storage and retrieval of digital documents and photographs, 
including the limits to the information that can be gleaned 
from the metadata. Mr. Kelso may testify in rebuttal to an 
testimony offered by the government through 
As trial preparation proceeds, the defense will update the 
topics for Mr. Kelso if any arise. 
(Ex. A at 12-13). 
Similarly, the defendant anticipates == 
a financial investigator, to testify about: 
his review of certain financial records aided 
by the 
government in discovery. Specifically, Mr. IMIN will discuss 
various transfers of funds that are reflected in the financial 
records and explain the information contained in the financial 
records regarding those transfers. 
(Id. at 13). 
To the extent Kelso and 
are expected to summarize evidence otherwise in the record, 
that testimony is not expert testimony, and therefore its admission is not precluded by Rule 702. 
EFTA00024977
--- PAGE 25 ---
See United States v. Lebedev, 932 F.3d 40, 50 (2d Cir. 2019) (concluding that "an account and 
litigation consultant" who "summar[ized] . . . the relevant financial records" was not an expert 
witness). The Government has similarly provided expert notice in an abundance of caution for 
an FBI computer forensic examiner who will testify as a fact witness about his 
extraction of devices seized pursuant to court authorized search warrants and evidence recovered 
from those devices.' 
To the extent Kelso and 
would testify based on their "scientific, technical, or other 
specialized knowledge," however, that testimony is expert testimony. Id. (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 
702(a)). And any such testimony is not reflected in the expert notice. These expert notices provide 
lists of "general and in some cases extremely broad topics," which is "plainly inadequate" under 
Rule 16. Ulbricht, 858 F.3d at 115. For instance, the notice for Kelso states that he will testify 
"generally about computer forensic principles associated with the creation of documents," and 
testify "about user data associated with certain devices seized and searched by the government's 
team in this case." (Ex. A at 12). It also states that the defense may "update the topics for Mr. 
Kelso" before trial. (Id. at 13 (emphasis added)). Similarly, 
will "discuss various transfers 
of funds that are reflected in the financial records and explain the information contained in the 
financial records." (Id.). These lists of topics do not permit the Government to identify Kelso and 
opinions, determine whether the proffered experts are in fact expert on those subjects, and 
litigate the reliability and relevance of those opinions. 
The Government also pointed to four other cases in this District and the Eastern District in which 
testified, including United States v. Kelly, 19 Cr. 286 (AMD) (E.D.N.Y.). 
EFTA00024978
--- PAGE 26 ---
Accordingly, the Court should preclude expert testimony from Kelso and 
unless and 
until the defense to provides supplemental expert notice forthwith. 12 If the defense does so, the 
Government should have an opportunity at that time to litigate its admissibility. And if the defense 
does not do so, those witnesses should be limited to purely factual testimony. See Lebedev, 932 
F.3d at 50 (affirming a limiting instruction clarifying that the witness was not providing an expert 
opinion). 
B. Forensic Document Specialists 
Finally, the defendant has identified two forensic document specialists who she may call 
as expert witnesses. Gerald LaPorte is a "Forensic Chemist and Document Dating Specialist," and 
Jennifer Naso is a "Forensic Document Examiner." (Ex. A at 13-14). Regarding their expert 
opinions, the defendant writes: 
Defendant anticipates the receipt of documents produced by 
the government and documents received pursuant to defense 
subpoena included but not limited to journal pages by witness 
[Minor Victim-2]. These documents may require analysis 
regarding the dates of creation, completeness, alteration and 
manipulation. When these documents are disclosed, 
Defendant will seek to have them analyzed and present 
testimony on the analysis as needed. 
(Id. at 13-14). 
This notice also does not provide the experts' "opinions" or "the bases and reasons for 
those opinions." Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(b)(1)(C). It does not even identify the set of documents 
Similarly, absent additional expert notice, Kelso and 
should be required to limit their 
testimony to facts in the record. Experts—but not other witnesses—may rely on facts or data that 
are not admissible, and may disclose them to the jury in certain circumstances. See Fed. R. Evid. 
703, 705. 
EFTA00024979
--- PAGE 27 ---
purportedly awaited or topics of testimony, besides documents that "may require analysis," leading 
to whatever testimony is "needed." (Ex. A at 13-14). This is plainly inadequate under the rules, 
and the Government cannot litigate the qualifications, reliability, or relevance of unknown 
testimony about unidentified documents at this time. 
Of course, the Court has the option of permitting the defense to clarify this notice mid-trial 
whenever the defense receives and reviews the documents they have in mind. Doing so, however, 
would almost certainly lead to mid-trial Dauber! briefing, possibly a mid-trial Daubert hearing, 
and late-breaking rebuttal expert notice by the Government. 
The better course is to require the defense to identify, immediately, the documents they 
expect to be the subject of forensic analysis and the precise forensic methodology that these experts 
will use to analyze those documents. That may—depending on the details—permit some Daubert 
litigation to occur now, because the Government may be able to agree with, or challenge, the notion 
that these experts are qualified to use the methodology, that the methodology is reliable, or that 
the document is relevant. See, e.g., Jennifer L. Mnookin, "Scripting Expertise: The History of 
Handwriting Identification Evidence and the Judicial Construction of Reliability," 87 Va. L. Rev. 
1723, 1726-27 (2001) (describing "major pretrial battles being waged over the admissibility of . . . 
expert evidence in handwriting identification"). 13
Here too, the Court should order the defendant to provide additional expert notice of the 
methodology these experts intend to use, and the precise documents they expect to examine. Such 
It would of course defeat the purpose of an order along these lines if the defendant gives expert 
notice of numerous document examination methodologies, requiring extensive Daubert litigation 
that may stretch into trial and would far exceed the scope any actual testimony that may be 
presented at trial. 
EFTA00024980
--- PAGE 28 ---
an order will likely permit the Government to interpose a Daubert challenge now. Absent rapid 
supplemental notice along these lines, the Court should preclude the forensic document specialists. 
CONCLUSION 
For the reasons set forth above, the Government respectfully requests that the Court 
preclude the testimony of Dr. Ryan Hall and Bennett Gershman; preclude any expert testimony 
(as opposed to fact testimony) by Robert Kelso or 
and preclude any testimony at all 
from the forensic document specialists, unless and until the defendant provides supplemental 
expert notice, which the Court should order the defense to provide forthwith.

We are requesting that this legal mail be given to Ms. Maxwell immediately. 
She must have them by tomorrow, Friday, for review over the weekend. 
I received no response to the email regarding these documents (see below). 
The courtesy of a response to today's email is appreciated. 
Thank you-

Good morning-
On Thursday, 12/14, we are express mailing time-sensitive documents for next-day delivery for review by 
Ms. Maxwell. We need to discuss these documents with Ms. Maxwell on Tuesday 12/19, in order to comply 
with a court-ordered filing deadline. We understand that legal calls are suspended on holidays (Monday, 
1/18, is Martin Luther King Day). 
To ensure that Ms. Maxwell receives the documents on Friday for review over the weekend, we are 
requesting permission to send them to the attention of the Legal Department for prompt delivery to Ms. 
Maxwell. 
Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
In addition, we are requesting that Ms. Maxwell be given access to the laptop 
computer provided by the government for use over the weekend. 
The MDC computers are not capable of opening discovery documents provided by the government, 
which is why the laptop has been provided. Without access to a computer that allows her 
to review discovery, Ms. Maxwell is effectively denied the ability to assist in her defense. 
Your assistance is greatly appreciated.

Hi 
The Florida State Attorney, Dave Aronberg, left me the attached message. I'm assuming this relates to the 
Epstein case (though it's possible, given the timing of the call today, that it relates to WBTW). Since this is the 
State Attorney himself, I wanted to check with you before calling back to see if you'd prefer to speak with him. 
Thanks,

Just confirming receipt. Also, I'm hopeful that we can have everything gathered by April 12th. However, I'll be out of the 
office for the next week so it might be delayed. Will that be a problem? 
In addition, and just for confirmation's sake, you are ok that we will make reasonable efforts to notify the 
parents/students of the subpoena prior to compliance with the subpoena correct?

I apologize about not getting back with you. I thought the other attorney that filed the response was going to do so. 
Regardless, the response included everything that Interlochen has. They only keep tuition payment information for 7 
years and nothing in their files reflects any payments by Epstein or Epstein entities.

Jeff and George, 
Thank you both very much for your assistance in response to our subpoenas seeking records from Interlochen. In 
reviewing the documents you produced in response to the attached subpoena, a follow-up question arose. Would 
you please confirm that your production included all records of any tuition payments that Epstein (or his entities) 
made for any students at Interlochen? 
Our team is also happy to discuss this inquiry over the phone if that would be useful. I am starting a trial tomorrow

Re: 
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) 
Dear Counsel: 
Today the Government is producing additional materials, including Jencks Act and 
Giglio material, regarding witnesses who may be called to testify at trial in the above-referenced 
case. Enclosed please find an index detailing the materials included in today's production. 
The Government is also producing today certain materials relating to individuals the 
Government does not currently intend to call as witnesses at trial in the above-referenced case. 
These materials do not contain a comprehensive set of Jencks Act and Giglio materials, as the 
Government does not expect to call these individuals to testify at trial. Instead, these materials 
contain, among other things, certain witness statements. Enclosed please find an index detailing 
these materials. Please note that the records stamped 3501.507 through 3501.516 were previously 
produced to you on October 11, 2021 with a different stamp (3501.450 through 3501.459), which 
was inadvertently used for two sets of witnesses. The Government is reproducing the materials to 
avoid any confusion. This production should not be taken to indicate that the Government believes 
it has any obligation to provide all of these materials; rather, we make this production as a courtesy. 
Moreover, although the Government presently does not intend to call the individuals listed in the 
EFTA00025035
--- PAGE 2 ---
Page 2 
enclosed index, we reserve the right to do so and will notify you should the Government determine 
that it intends to call any of these individuals at trial. 
Please note that this letter, the enclosed indices, and the enclosed materials are 
governed by the July 31, 2020 Protective Order in this case. In particular, the entire production 
is designated as "confidential" under the Protective Order. The index is itself designated as 
"confidential," because it includes information regarding records designated as 
"confidential" under the Protective Order. The Department of Justice directed this office to 
cease the dissemination of materials marked with the word "confidential" in order to avoid 
potential confusion with markings reserved for classified documents. Accordingly, in order to 
note the appropriate designation of this production under the operative Protective Order in this 
case, the materials being produced today are marked with the following label: "SUBJECT TO 
PROTECTIVE ORDER PARAGRAPHS 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, and 17." This marking directly refers to 
the specific paragraphs of the Protective Order that govern today's production. 
Additionally, please note that many of the individuals referenced in this production are 
represented by counsel, as detailed in the enclosed indices. The Government reserves its right to 
amend and supplement these disclosures. 
Very truly yours, 
DAMIAN WILLIAMS

Hi Chris, 
I think the answer is yes, but just to make sure: we'd file the Government's proposal on Wednesday, you'd file whatever 
redline you like on November 3. It also occurs to us that, since your redline will presumably contain new 
proposals/objections to ours and would not include our views, we'd want to file a short reply on November 5 or 8. 
We'd consent to that option and, if you like, would join your motion for that schedule.

I just want to clarify the redline option. If we did the redline option, would you file the government's RTC (without 
defense comment) on Oct. 27 and then we would file the joint RTC (i.e., our redline of your RTCs) on Nov. 3? And you 
would consent to that option?

Hi Chris, 
We had another idea that might facilitate things. We know Judge Nathan asked for a joint RTC, but what about asking 
Judge Nathan to let us file separate ones? We would also be comfortable setting a deadline for the defense RTC (or a 
defense redline of ours) on November 3. 
If you were to make a request to file separate RTCs, with your deadline on November 3, we would join that request. 
Thanks,

Given all of the other things we have going on this week, the defense would like a little more time to submit the joint 
requests to charge. We plan to ask the Court for an extension until Monday, Nov. 1. Does the government consent to that 
request?

Dear Judge Nathan:

Neo: Vail NY ICC22 
.1 212 057 76X, Ocri, 
:Ave, cat-nsns.....ta con 
We respectfully submit this letter to request a one-week extension until November 3, 2021, 
to file the joint proposed jury charge and verdict sheet, which are currently due on October 27, 
2021. See 8/27/2021 Order (Dkt. 330). The government consents to this request. 
On October 20, 2021, the government provided the defense with its proposed jury charge. 
Because of the press of other deadlines in this case—including the motions in limine responses 
and replies, and the Rule 412 briefing—the defense requests an additional week to provide its 
counterproposals to the government and to submit the final proposed jury charge to the Court. 
The government and the defense have met and conferred and agreed that the defense will 
send the government a redlined version of the government's proposed jury charge containing the 
defense's counterproposals by November 1, 2021. The parties will submit the final joint proposed 
request to charge and verdict sheet, with the areas of continued disagreement shown in redline, on 
November 3, 2021. We respectfully request that the Court approve this revised schedule. 
Sincerely, 
Is/ Christian Everdell

I'm happy to have a call. I'm available Monday all morning, Tuesday until 10:30am and Wednesday all morning. 
I apologize about not getting back with you. I thought the other attorney that filed the response was going to do so. 
Regardless, the response included everything that Interlochen has. They only keep tuition payment information for 7 
years and nothing in their files reflects any payments by Epstein or Epstein entities. 
Thanks,

Hi Jeff, 
No, I don't think you responded. Totally understandable given everything that has gone on in the last month. I'd still

Jeff and George, 
ye 
Thank you both very much for your assistance in response to our subpoenas seeking records from Interlochen. In 
reviewing the documents you produced in response to the attached subpoena, a follow-up question arose. Would 
you please confirm that your production included all records of any tuition payments that Epstein (or his entities) 
made for any students at Interlochen? 
Our team is also happy to discuss this inquiry over the phone if that would be useful. I am starting a trial tomorrow 
and will have limited availability this week, but my colleagues 
and 
(both cc'd) should be 
able to coordinate with you as needed.

Hi Mr. 
As I discussed with Ms. ever

All, 
Thanks for the call this afternoon, it was helpful to work through the mechanics of filing redactions this afternoon. As we 
discussed, we're sending you versions of the following documents, with redactions applied: (1) the Government's motion 
in limine, (2) the defendant's opposition, and (3) the Government's reply. 
Please let us know if you would like us to add any redactions to these versions, and we'll get them filed. With respect to 
Exhibits: 
• We are attaching a proposed redacted version of Government exhibit A. 
• Only defense exhibits E and G can be filed publicly without redactions. 
• All other defense exhibits to the defense opposition should be filed under seal.

Re: 
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) 
Dear Counsel: 
Pursuant to Judge Nathan's Order of September 3, 2021 (Dkt. No. 335), the Government 
writes to inform you that it may refer at trial to the following individuals as co-conspirators of the 
defendant, including for the purpose of Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E): 
• 
Jeffre E 'stein 
The Government has produced all co-conspirator statements which it intends to offer at 
trial pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E) in the Government's production today or in its previous 
productions. To the extent the Government learns of additional co-conspirator statements as it 
continues to prepare for trial, it will produce those statements in connection with its ongoing 
obligation to produce Jencks Act material. 
EFTA00025067
--- PAGE 3 ---
Page 2 
Please be advised that the above list is limited to the individuals the Government may refer 
to as co-conspirators at trial. While the Government makes no representations as to whether it 
views other individuals as potential or actual co-conspirators of the defendant, it does not intend 
to refer to any other individuals as co-conspirators at trial. The above list is also not intended to 
reflect a complete list of individuals who may be referenced at trial. That information is contained 
in the Government's Jencks Act production(s). 
Please note that this letter and the information contained herein is governed by the July 31, 
2020 Protective Order in this case. This letter is itself designated as "confidential" under the 
Protective Order.

Counsel, 
A supplemental production of non-testifying witness material is now ready to produce. Attached please find the cover 
letter and index accompanying this production. Because the production contains audio and video files, it is too large to 
produce via USAfx. Would you please provide our office with two drives (128 GB should be more than sufficient) for us to 
load with one copy for you and one copy to be sent to Ms. Maxwell at the MDC? 
One thing to note: as indicated in the cover letter, DM has recently directed our office to cease production of materials 
marked with the word "confidential" in order to avoid confusion with markings reserved for classified documents. 
Accordingly, we have noted the appropriate designation for this production by using the label, "SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE 
ORDER PARAGRAPHS 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, and 17," which references the relevant paragraphs in the Protective Order governing 
confidential materials. Please let us know if you have any objection to this marking or would like to discuss.

Hey.. 
As discussed, I reviewed all the travel records you sent. Unfortunately, the outbound travel records were not recorded in 
CBP database during that time (between 1990-2000) as they are today. In short, the TECS travel records you have for 
Maxwell and Epstein are all we have in CBP holdings so there's nothing further I can provide for that date range. 
However, if you want travel records beyond 2000 I can certainly provide that just let me know if you have a specific date 
range you looking for. 
EFTA00025076
--- PAGE 3 ---
Since 
has two different name variations (with and without the space in her surname) you were 
provided two separate TECS travel records. After reviewing both records, they are accurate and include all her travel 
crossings recorded in CBP holdings. Attached is an excel spreadsheet that includes her full travel crossings in 
chronological order for you to cross reference with the TECS records provided. Hopefully it will make it easier to review 
her travel rather than going back and forth between the two PDFs. 
If you need any additional info (visa/passport applications, travel records, etc.) or have any questions please don't 
hesitate to reach out!

Hi 
Hope you're both well! 
I'm working with colleagues in London about a story that DOJ had passed information to the UK FCA about Jes 
Staley's relationship with Epstein. 
You might have seen this morning that Barclays disclosed the UK's FCA and PRA are investigating Staley's 
statements about his links to Epstein. 
I wanted to check if there was any steer or background you could give me on the information DOJ passed to the 
UK authorities? And also if you had any comment?

Thanks very much, 
. In my searches, I'm still seeing the 6:44pm American flight, but looks like it's now landing at 
12:25 AM. Do you see that? 
If not, is it possible the flight is only available non-refundable? If that's the case, then I suppose we should hold off 
booking until we have final confirmation on the schedule from our agents.

I was in the midst of making your travel reservations, but I'm unable to see the return flight from PNS — LGA 
departing at 6:44pm on 2/19, arriving at 12:03am on 2/20 that you requested in the attached email below. I assume that 
it's no longer available. 
The latest flight returning to LGA is leaving at 4:06pm, which I assume is too early. The latest return flight time I found 
that's fully refundable is departing PNS at 5:53pm, arriving in JFK at 1:24am on 2/20/20. Let me know if this flight is okay 
to book and I'll reserve it ASAP. Thanks.

Hi

Would you please help us book travel to Pensacola, FL and back for next week? I'd like refundable tickets for the following 
flights, please: 
• 
Tuesday 2/18 American Airlines flight from WA to PNS, departing 5:00 PM, arriving 9:03 PM (layover in DCA) 
• 
Wednesday 2/19 American Airlines flight from PNS to WA, departing 6:44 PM, arriving 12:03 AM (layover in CLT) 
Please make sure the tickets are refundable just in case we need to move things around. We are still waiting to hear back 
from the agents about where exactly we should be staying for the hotel, so we'd like to just book the flights for now, and 
I'll let you know when we have a more precise location for the hotel.

Similar to prior requests in connection with the Epstein investigation (2018R01618), but with an added international 
element, we'd like to please request permission for the team to travel next week for an interview near Stockholm, 
Sweden, next week on January 29th and/or 30th. We expect to be traveling, respectively, some combination of the 27th

formal applications. Also similar to prior trips, we'd like to request approval to get a conference room for one of those 
days at a hotel for the interview itself. 
Also based on our discussion earlier we'll be mindful of looking for domestic (or domestic-flagged) carrier flights, as well 
as the costs of any alternatives, in looking at possible specific bookings. Thanks as always for your help and input on 
that.

Response to Follow Up Questions from 2/13/20 Attorney Proffer 
Dear Counsel: 
Below please find our reply, in no particular order, to your follow-up questions 
from the 2/13/20 attorney proffer. As we discussed, the same terms covering 
the attorney proffer govern these communications as well. 
Who told 
to keep to herself, not ask questions and not to fraternize 
with those she encountered through her work with JE? 
When. was first hired, Ms. Maxwell told her not to fraternize with any of JE's 
business associates, friends, etc. It was Epstein who reprimanded -for 
breaking this rule when she appeared at the party, the details of which were 
set forth on 2/13. So, it was both Maxwell and Epstein who directed M not to 
fraternize and to stick to business 
Qualifications for the job. Did she replace anyone? Who trained her? 
Were massages already on the agenda when =took over? 
Prior to working for JE, 
a
had managed an office supply company for 9 years 
and then worked in the men's department at Nordstrom's selling clothes. This 
was a commission-based job and she did quite well. • 
placed her resume on 
Monster.com looking for a job in event planning. The headhunter Epstein had 
hired contacted M, not to work for Epstein, but for a job with the NY Knicks as 
an event planner. Unfortunately, as a result of a large snowstorm LG could not 
get into the City from NJ and missed the Knicks opportunity (the position had 
been filled by the time she finally met with Russell, the headhunter.) Once 
Russell interviewed =, he asked if she had time to go meet with someone who 
she could "event plan" for. 
interviewed with Maxwell and then with 
Epstein and hired. - 
had not heard of JE prior to that time. 
was trained 
by JE's then assistant, 
. 
and others told • 
that massages were 
a part of JE's
 --just part of his normal day. Akin to someone going daily 
to the gym. 
remained in the company as a receptionist
er Mums hired 
and later became Ms. Maxwell's assistant after 
Mvas 
given no explicit instructions regarding massage appointments by
Massage appointments were to be handled like any other appointments. 
does not recall anything specific being discussed about the women. Massage 
appointments were a part of a normal day and were usually a daily occurrence. 
Note: Correction to my proffer. 
generally made 1-2 appointments for 
massages a day. I misstated that JE had 4 or more daily. 
does not know if 
massages were being scheduled after hours after she left for home. Massages 
EFTA00025091
--- PAGE 2 ---
were at times cancelled and rescheduled if JE got busy. 
also 
scheduled massages. 
After JE pleaded guilty in FL, did 
schedule massages? 
was not asked to make massage appointments after his plea, and, to her 
memory, the word `massage' was not used again. 
Does Eremember the names of people who she scheduled massages 
with? Is there a list of names? When JE called to schedule a massage, if 
a person was a repeat masseuse, did JE just say call X? If the person was 
not available, did 1. ask the person if she had the name of a third party 
to do a massage? Who else made massage appointments? 
Names of the masseuses were usually by first name. JE provided Ma name 
and a phone number. Once the name of any new contact was given, ).vas 
directed to always add the name and phone number to her company directory 
maintained on the computer. At times, masseuse(s) would have the same 
name, so for example, JE referred to X as Little X or Big X. 
does not recall 
any names since there many names and the masseuses would come and go. If 
a person particular erson requested by JE was not available =would inform 
JE. JE might ask 
to call a different individual. At times, JE directed 
to 
ask X (if she was unavailable) if she had a friend who was available. When 
was away from the job for vacation, pregnancy, maternity leave, etc., 
, 
(before she left in 
approximate)
 made all appointments, business, and otherwise. After 
the birth of 
son in Dec. 2004, she was on maternity leave for 3 months. 
Upon her return, she worked only 3 days a week for several years. 
DidEever work out of the mansion? Did.. have a workspace or office 
there? Does Elknow who worked out of the house? 
=worked out of the Villard House at the Helmsley exclusively from day one 
until they moved the office to the 66th Street apartments around 2009. • 
worked out of the Palm Beach office twice in 2009 for approximate) one day 
each visit. The offices moved to 575 Lexington Ave around 2010. Wfi worked 
from the mansion from approximately 2012 (not sure) onward, but only when 
Epstein was in NY. Her office was on the first floor at the very front of the 
mansion. When Mr. Epstein was not in NY, she worked from home, which 
occurred over 50% of the time. 
Mr. Epstein had staff at the mansion. Maid, Houseman, Engineer, Chef, other 
maids. 
EFTA00025092
--- PAGE 3 ---
During the time of JE's previous case, did anyone ask El to get rid of 
anything or is she aware of any other type of obstruction (even if it was 
not apparent at the time)? 
M was never asked to get rid of anything. They did upgrade the antiquated PC 
computer system over to Mac around 2009 and converted from BlackBerry 
phones to Apple iPhones. 
Once they moved into the office at 575 Lexington Ave, at some point (she does 
not recall exactly when) old storage boxes with folders arrived from storage and 
were shredded by an "office helper" 
, who did odds and ends type of jobs 
for Epstein. At one time she was cleaning the apartments and the offices 
located at the apartment building at 301 East 66th- =does not know what 
was in the folders and was told it was time to get rid of very old files not worth 
paying to store. 
What was 
M
I
impression of MIMI) 
Maxwell? Did she discuss if 
she had had a relationship with Mr. Epstein? Ever say she was abused? 
Did she seem intimidated by him? Scared? 
was hired as Epstein's traveling assistant sometime around 2002 3. El 
thought 
was nice, responsible, organized and professional. 
ver 
discussed having a relationship with Epstein or being abused by him. 
sure 
there were times 
felt intimidated or scared if she made an error, but it 
was not discussed. Mr. Epstein was very demanding and could be very intense 
to everyone he worked with. 
thought both 
and Maxwell were professional and treated her with 
respect. They both were busy people, and =recalls that Maxwell was building 
her brownstone when aras 
first hired. 
didn't interact with her very 
much, and she believes that Maxwell was intimidated and scared of Epstein at 
times. = 
had no social relationship with either of them. 
Did 
schedule massages for JE at locations other than NY? 
Sometimes in FL. 
DidM keep a directory/database of people I called for JE? 
Yes. They had a directory but it was a directory of everyone JE knew. IN did 
not have a separate directory or database for just masseuses. As far as she 
can recall, everyone in the office had access to the directory and could add to it 
as well. 
When JE told =to schedule a massage, what was the time frame for the 
appointment? (i.e. that day? Next week?) 
EFTA00025093
--- PAGE 4 ---
Mostly that day. Sometimes the next day.
At any time during the FL investigation, did 
receive a subpoena? Was 
there any discussion with JE about it? 
did receive a subpoena. She only knows it was handled and was not 
involved with the FL case/investigation. JE had one conversation with 
about the case as relayed in the proffer. JE asked her if she knew about 
e 
case, and she replied she didn't need to know. JE said that someone was trying 
to blackmail him and apologized for the disruption it was causing to the office. 
JE also said that it was embarrassing. 
Were there any discussions with JE about future payments to a 
(i.e. in 
his will, if she left, retirement or otherwise)? 
No. 
Were there any conversations with JE or Maxwell re civil suits? Did they 
ever ask 
E
l
to be dishonest in replying? How was she advised by JE or 
others? Aware of any obstructive conduct? 
did not have any conversations with JE or Maxwell re civil suits. They 
never asked her to be dishonest, and never advised by him or others about the 
suit, and she is not aware of any obstructive conduct. 
What were the logistics of international and other flight travel 
arrangements? What travel agencies etc. were used? 
Travel was booked through a travel agency and on-line bookings for both 
international and domestic flights. (Shoppers Travel when she was first hired 
then Amex Centurion. Other agencies may have been used also but she cannot 
recall the names. Online services could be Orbitz, Travelocity, Google, etc. 
Epstein wanted the best pricing but also wanted exact times for flights to 
depart/land.) 
Many times, people flew with Mr. Epstein on his private plane. Prior to JE's 
plea, most travel was done by other administrator in the office or by 
may have booked a trip from time to time but usually was too busy to do 
so. After JE returned to the office around 2011, 
still booked 
travel. Once 
was married and left, Epstein had 
and 
sometimes illbooking travel. Aii
mately in 2016 (?) Epstein asked • 
to 
take over travel because he felt 
was incompetent when it came to 
finding the best pricing for good flights. Epstein told the 
wanted to hire a 
new person to take over handling all the travel, but he never found anyone. 
EFTA00025094
--- PAGE 5 ---
When did 
leave JE's employ? 
resigned end of July 2019. She felt betrayed and disgusted once the 
indictment came out. 
Before the arrest, was she already planning to leave? 
considered leaving after the arrest in 2010. She perused websites and 
interviewed with a high-end staffing agency. After considering what was 
available, she realized her job offered a lifestyle flexibility that she could not 
replicate anywhere else. Epstein was still communicating with the same 
businesspeople, scientists, politicians etc., and she simply gave him the benefit 
of the doubt that he had done his time, etc. JE continued to claim it was all 
blackmail. Working from home, being a good mother and wife were and are 
the most important aspects in of her life. This job allowed her both a 
challenging, interesting job and still be an attentive mom and wife. 
What was 
reaction to the charges? 
As discussed in the proffer, she felt used, and realized that despite what JE 
said to her about the previous case, she realized that the allegations were likely 
real and she felt betrayed. She had mixed emotions given the time she spent 
there.Mfelt that Epstein kept her in front of a curtain, a façade. She was a 
real executive assistant with real executive functions, but he used her to 
conceal his personal problems and predilections. 
Was Never the subject of JE's abuse in any way? 
No.
Did. ever observe JE acting inappropriately with women? Employees 
or others? 
No.
Impression of JE's business? How did he make money? 
Epstein was a money manager. He managed Les Wexner's money and possibly 
other client's money. Mhought he made money just on his own money by 
interest and trading. 
Was Mrepresented in any way in the FL case where named in the non-
prosecution provision? 
She met with Nate Dershowitz once, but does not recall any specific questions 
from him. She did not know she was in the non-prosecution agreement. 
EFTA00025095
--- PAGE 6 ---
How much time did 
spend at the Palm Beach residence? 
None.
Did LG ever visit other properties, New Mexico ranch, Little St. James 
Island, Great St. James island or the Paris residence? 
never went to the ranch in New Mexico. As stated in the proffer, in or about 
2002, when le and her husband went to London for vacation, Epstein 
suggested they go to Paris while abroad and stay in a guest room of his Paris 
apartment around. nand her husband also visited Little St. James island 
and had lunch there on a trip to Tortola for a wedding around 2002/3). Post 
2014, 
went to Little St. James island on two other occasions- to view 
construction work. Epstein was hoping 
could help by following up with 
contractors and staff, organization and keeping things on schedule.= flew in, 
spent a few hours with ".M," the island manager, then went back to St. 
Thomas to a hotel to have dinner and slept there. Mwas up early the next 
day to fly home. =wanted to fly in/out same day but it is not possible with 
any of the airlines flight schedules). On her second trip, she visited Great St. 
James as well to view construction. She never went to the Palm Beach 
residence - only to the Palm Beach office on two or so occasions to work - for 
quick one-night trip. 
Clearing up a few points: 
2001-2009 (or 2008 when they), cash was always kept in the office in the 
accounting department while they worked out of the Villard house. Money 
would be messengered from the office in envelopes prior to Epstein's plea.
do not recall much, if any, messengering of money after he went to jail. 
Parenthetically, Epstein liked to use messengers and Fed Ex for everything, 
buying a book online, for example, he wanted to spend the money to expedite 
the delivery. He didn't want to wait for anything and had the money to pay for 
the fastest service available.) Money would be messengered per Epstein's 
directive to do so. =relayed to the accounting department that 1' amount 
should be messengered to X. Sometimes she would set up the messenger and 
sometimes the rece tionist would set up the messenger. Either an address 
would be given to 
by Epstein. Alternatively,. or the receptionist, would 
need to call X and ask where to messenger the envelope. ,does not recall 
any masseuse or other persons ever coming to the office to pick up an envelope 
of money. There was never any discussion of prostitution or anything sexual 
that she heard. No one she saw appeared to be underage. 
After 2011, 
had an office at Mr. Epstein's mansion because he no longer 
had a recognizable 'office address' to work from. The office at 575 Lexington 
was like a We Work environment - lots of small businesses working out of small 
EFTA00025096
--- PAGE 7 ---
offices. Epstein did not want to hold his meetings from the We Work 
atmosphere and wanted all his appointments to come see him at his mansion. 
office was located at the front of the mansion. Generally, when someone 
entered the residence, he/she passed her office. When a visitor came to meet 
with Epstein, he would either go straight back to see him from the front door to 
the dining room where he held his meetings or he would wait in 
ffice 
until JE was ready/available to meet with them. Due to where 
desk was 
situated, if someone went straight back to the dining room, 
d not see 
them.

I think this is helpful timing, since you have our naming and tracking systems up and running— we just got three emails 
with a bunch of new 302s for the Epstein case. I believe they should all be interview 302s, but let us know if there are 
other random reports as well. We got three emails with 302s attached, this is the first and I'll also send the other two —
could you please save each of the files into the correct witness folder, keeping the same naming convention, and update 
the Interview Tracker spreadsheet as you go? 
And then let us know when that's complete, and I'll look through and we can figure out what remains outstanding. Please 
let us know if any questions at all, either up front or as you go through, and thanks as always.

Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF Document 1 Filed 11/21/19 Page 1 of 13 
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
x 
Plaintiff, 
Case No. 19 Civ. 10788 
COMPLAINT 
-against- 
AND JURY DEMAND 
DARREN K. INDYKE and RICHARD D. KAHN, 
as EXECUTORS OF THE ESTATE OF JEFFREY E. 
EPSTEIN, 
Defendants. 
x 
Plaintiff 
by and through her attorneys, Cuti Hecker Wang LLP and 
Allred, Maroko & Goldberg, for her Complaint alleges as follows: 
NATURE OF THE ACTION 
1. 
When Plaintiff 
was just seventeen years old, living on her 
own and working full-time to support herself, Jeffrey Epstein preyed open her, manipulated her 
to be completely dependent on him, and sexually abused her. 
2. 
Epstein was presented to 
as someone who had learned about her 
challenging circumstances and had the resources and interest to assist her — including by helping 
her to attend college and study abroad to see the world. 
was introduced to Epstein by her 
sister, but 
was unaware that Epstein had been manipulating and sexually abusing her sister, 
as Epstein's total power and control over 
sister made it impossible for her to say 
anything about it. 
3. 
During their early interactions, Epstein led 
to believe that he would 
help her achieve her dream of becoming a translator, and he arranged for 
to study abroad 
in Spain. 
gave up her job and her apartment in anticipation of this life-changing 
opportunity, leaving her completely dependent on Epstein and his continuing generosity. 
EFTA00025109
--- PAGE 2 ---
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF Document 1 Filed 11/21/19 Page 2 of 13 
4. 
Epstein exploited this power over seventeen-year-old 
to sexually 
abuse her repeatedly. Ultimately, he raped and sexually assaulted her frequently and in a variety 
of places and settings, including by trafficking 
to his homes in New York, New Mexico, 
Florida, the Virgin Islands, and France. He treated her like an object for his sexual gratification. 
5. 
These assaults caused 
to feel completely intimidated and fearful. 
She froze up and began to cry, able to think only about trying to survive. 
6. 
Epstein continued to exert total control over 
life for two more 
years, trafficking her around the country and the world and sexually abusing her on a frequent 
basis. During this time, 
felt deep despair and isolation, and developed a severe and self-
destructive eating disorder. Still within his power and control, 
confided in Epstein about 
her disorder, mistakenly believing that she could trust him. Rather than help her, Epstein cast 
her out within hours of her admission, sending her back to a place where she no longer had a 
home, a job or any resources or support. 
7. 
Epstein's abuse destroyed 
life. She sank into alcoholism and 
other self-harm, unable to trust others but not understanding why. 
8. 
At the same time, like so many childhood sex abuse victims, she did not 
comprehend how it had undone her or her life, or how it impacted her. 
9. 
Now a working mother of three, 
is still just beginning to 
understand the depth of the injuries from the sexual assaults that Epstein inflicted on her 
beginning when she was seventeen. She feels the toll of Epstein's abuse every day. She feels 
dysfunctional, on-edge, overwhelmed, and like she is on the verge of a psychological 
breakdown. She has difficulty sleeping and often has flashbacks to Epstein's abuse. 
10. 
Epstein died in August 2019, before 
or the countless other 
girls he preyed upon could obtain a modicum of justice.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 
29. 
When Plaintiff 
was seventeen years old, Jeffrey Epstein 
preyed upon her, manipulating her to be completely dependent on him and then sexually 
assaulting and raping her on numerous occasions. Epstein continued this pattern of manipulation 
and frequent sexual assault for years, leaving 
with deep emotional wounds that she is 
still just beginning to grapple with. 
30. 
By age seventeen, 
had already lived through tremendously 
challenging circumstances. At eleven years old, she was homeless for a year, staying with 
various friends and seeing her mother only about once a week. At fifteen, 
began working 
in order to support herself. At sixteen, 
living situation was again unstable, and she 
moved to Los Angeles to live with her older sister. 
31. 
initially tried to go to school in Los Angeles, but was unable to 
continue due to the need to work full-time to support herself. 
lived with her sister and 
worked at a hair salon, eventually getting her GED. By the time 
met Epstein, she had 
already been living on her own and working full-time for a year-and-a-half. 
32. 
sister — who is five years older than her — had previously met 
Epstein and traveled with him. 
sister described Epstein to her as a generous wealthy 
person, and reported that he often helped make it possible for people to attend college. 
sister reported that Epstein had heard 
story and that he wanted to help. 
33. 
Unbeknownst to = 
Epstein had been manipulating and sexually 
abusing her sister. 
had no idea that her sister had been involved in any type of sexual 
interactions with Epstein. Epstein's power and control of 
sister made it impossible for 
her to say anything.

Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF Document 1 Filed 11/21/19 Page 6 of 13 
34. 
met Epstein for the first time in 2002, when she was seventeen years 
old. Epstein was visiting Los Angeles, and 
drove with her sister to meet him at the Hotel 
Bel-Air. 
35. 
During that first meeting, Epstein lay on a bed in his spacious hotel suite, 
fully clothed. He asked 
sister to massage his feet, then encouraged 
to join her. 
Afterwards, Epstein took them shopping, and insisted on buying several items for 
36. 
After that meeting, Epstein kept in touch with 
through frequent 
phone calls. Epstein veered the conversation toward 
career goals and how Epstein could 
help her achieve them. He purported to want to help her and guide her to a better life. 
37. 
Epstein offered to send 
to school to learn hairdressing, but 
made clear that this was not what she wanted to do in the long term. 
explained that she 
had a passion for languages and for people, and that her dream was to be a translator. 
38. 
Epstein claimed that he wanted to help 
study to become a translator. 
He suggested that he would pay for 
to study in Spain for a semester. Soon after, Epstein 
helped her to obtain a letter of recommendation from her high school counselor and helped her 
get accepted to study at the University of Madrid. 
39. 
was over the moon, feeling her dreams were coming true. Epstein 
made sure she felt that it was all his doing. 
40. 
prepared for this exciting opportunity to study abroad and pursue 
her dream career. She gave notice at her hairdressing job and gave up her apartment in Los 
Angeles, preparing to move to Spain. 
41. 
Before 
left for her school program, however, Epstein began what 
would become a long pattern of using her as his sexual object.

Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF Document 1 Filed 11/21/19 Page 7 of 13 
42. 
In approximately the summer of 2002, Epstein flew 
and her sister to 
his ranch in New Mexico. 
felt no reason to be wary of Epstein. He had been kind in their 
first meeting and had acted with generosity towards her. 
43. 
When 
got to Epstein's ranch, Epstein's close associates Ghislaine 
Maxwell and 
were there. Maxwell asked 
questions about herself and took 
her horseback riding. 
invited 
to go swimming. 
44. 
After 
swam, Epstein asked her to go into a massage room along with 
began massaging Epstein, and 
innocently joined in, as she had when her 
sister massaged Epstein's feet the first time. 
45. 
At that point, Epstein began fondling 
and took off 
shirt. 
became very uncomfortable, as the massage had quickly and unexpectedly turned into a 
sexual encounter. Epstein reached inside 
bathing suit and fondled her genitals. 
began crying, but Epstein continued to grope her as he masturbated to completion. 
46. 
felt extremely vulnerable. Epstein had arranged the circumstances 
to ensure that 
was completely at his mercy. 
had given up her job and her apartment 
in order to travel to Spain at Epstein's expense. If Epstein decided to rethink his generosity at 
any point, 
would have had nothing, and would have been left homeless and jobless once 
again, after being brought so close to her dream. Even though Epstein had preyed upon her and 
sexually assaulted her, 
understood she had no choice but to submit to him. His power over 
her was all-encompassing. 
47. 
Epstein viciously exploited this power dynamic. In the summer and fall of 
2002, he flew seventeen-year-old 
to his homes in New York, Florida, and the U.S. Virgin 
Islands, sexually assaulting her in each of those locations. 
48. 
In or around December 2002, Epstein flew 
to stay at his townhouse 
EFTA00025115
--- PAGE 8 ---
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF Document 1 Filed 11/21/19 Page 8 of 13 
located at 9 East 71st Street in Manhattan. While they were in the dining room of the townhouse, 
Epstein without warning stuck his hand down 
pants and fondled her genitals. It was as if 
she were his toy. 
49. 
In or around that same month, at Epstein's home in Florida, Epstein crept 
into 
bedroom while she was sleeping and raped her. 
50. 
Also around that same month, at the private island Epstein owned in the 
Virgin Islands, Epstein ordered 
to massage him, then proceeded to sexually assault her in 
the massage room. 
51. 
finally traveled to Spain to study in or around the end of 2002. 
52. 
In early 2003, when 
was still seventeen years old, Epstein flew her 
from Madrid to Paris. At his home in Paris, Epstein again crept into 
bedroom while she 
slept and raped her. 
53. 
When Epstein inflicted these sexual assaults on M, she felt completely 
intimidated and fearful. All she could think about was trying to survive. Her body froze up, and 
she began crying. 
54. 
After 
semester in Madrid, she had no home and no job. Instead, 
Epstein brought her to live a nomadic lifestyle in his close orbit. 
traveled around the 
country with Epstein and his entourage, which generally included Maxwell, =, 
and others. 
Virtually every few days, Epstein would bring 
to a different home of his, including his 
Manhattan townhouse and throughout the country, where he continued to sexually assault her on 
a frequent basis. Epstein regularly used his private planes to traffic 
into various locations 
for his sexual abuse of her. 
55. 
Epstein had power over every aspect of 
life, and he had groomed 
to be completely dependent on him and completely submissive to him. Epstein treated 
EFTA00025116
--- PAGE 9 ---
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF Document 1 Filed 11/21/19 Page 9 of 13 
as a sexual object, using her body for his sexual gratification frequently and at his whim. 
56. 
Eventually, by approximately 2004, Epstein arranged for 
to live in 
an apartment at 301 East 66th Street in Manhattan, just blocks from his townhouse, when she 
was in New York. 
57. 
This pattern — of Epstein exercising total control over 
life and 
using her as a sexual object whenever he desired — continued throughout 2003 and 2004. Epstein 
arranged for 
to study abroad two more times, apparently when he grew bored with having 
her around. Each time, 
lived in this nomadic orbit with Epstein both before and after 
traveling to attend school. 
58. 
Epstein also tried to introduce 
to his "friends" and essentially offer 
her as a sexual object to them. In one instance, Epstein had 
spend time with a well-known 
Hollywood producer, who then demanded and attempted to engage in abusive sexual behavior. 
barely escaped. 
59. 
By 2004, 
felt deep despair and isolation. There was no one she 
could talk to about what Epstein was doing to her. Instead, Epstein had ensured that she thought 
he was the only person in her life whom she could trust. 
60. 
developed a severe eating disorder, for the first time, in or around 
2004. After she had struggled with the disorder for six months or a year, it became too much to 
bear. She confided in Epstein about the eating disorder, still manipulated into thinking he was 
someone she could trust. 
61. 
Instead, from the moment Epstein learned of 
self-destructive 
behavior, he immediately cast her out. Literally within hours of 
anxiously confessing to 
Epstein that she did not know why, but had a compulsive need to binge and purge, he threw her 
out. He instructed her to pack up her belongings and arranged for her to be flown to Arizona. 
EFTA00025117
--- PAGE 10 ---
Case 1:19-cv-10788-GHW-DCF Document 1 Filed 11/21/19 Page 10 of 13 
62. 
But there was nothing left for her in Arizona. She still had no idea what 
had happened to her and felt it was all her fault. 
63. 
Epstein's abuse destroyed 
life. After being cast out by him after 
two years of a lavish, if abusive, lifestyle, she sank into alcoholism and other self-harm, unable 
to trust others but not understanding why. 
64. 
is now a working mother raising three children. She is still 
struggling to put her life back together. 
65. 
is still in the nascent stages of understanding the deep and 
lasting injuries that Epstein's pattern of abuse has caused her, but she feels the effects every day. 
She feels dysfunctional, on-edge, and constantly overwhelmed. She has difficulty sleeping. She 
often has flashbacks to Epstein's sexual assaults. She feels like she is on the verge of a 
psychological breakdown. 
66. 
This action is timely under the law of each jurisdiction whose law might 
be determined to govern 
claims or aspects thereof, including without limitation 
New York, New Mexico, Florida, and the Virgin Islands. 
67. 
still has not disclosed her abuse to a licensed medical or 
mental health care provider in the context of receiving health care from the provider. 
68. 
is still just beginning to process and understand the full extent 
of the injuries that Epstein's abuse had caused her and the connection between Epstein's abuse 
and the emotional and psychological injuries she had experienced. 
69. 
This action is timely under New York law because it falls within New 
York CPLR 214-g and is brought during the one-year time period set forth in that section. The 
claims brought herein allege intentional and negligent acts and/or omissions for physical, 
psychological, and other injury suffered as a result of conduct that would constitute sexual

offenses as defined in Article 130 of the New York Penal Law, and such acts and/or omissions 
were committed against

Sigrid, 
That works for us, thanks very much — we'll plan for 2:00 on the 4th. 
And the street address is 1 St. Andrews Plaza, though for purposes of using Google Maps, it's often easier to get directions 
to 5 Centre Street — if you let her know the building is through an archway and just to the left of a very large outdoor red 
sculpture. And of course she should feel free to calm us if she needs any assistance with directions or transportation. 
Thanks,

Sigrid, 
Thank you again for speaking with us this afternoon, we appreciate it. As discussed, we wanted to follow up with you 
via email about a possible meeting with Ms. 
—it sounded like it might be convenient to do a meeting next 
week while you're in New York, if that would work for her? If so, if you could give us the dates and time ranges that 
might be possible, we can coordinate on scheduling on our end as well. And of course as always we're happy to address 
any questions that you or she might have in advance. 
thanks very much,

Subject: Epstein - Subpoena Tracker 
As a follow up to our conversation, I have attached a copy of my subpoena tracker. The tracker only includes 
subpoenas that were served by the FBI. As an example, the Epstein Deutsche Bank production is not included 
in this list. 
If you are missing any productions, please have 
contact me and I will provide it to him. 
You mentioned that is it is possible to set up a Dal virtual drive that we can share. That sounds great.

Hey 
Both myself and 
were pulled this week to assist with the riots and looting currently happening in 
Manhattan. Hopefully this does not go on for too long. When we return to the office we will be sure to fill in 
those blanks for you and hopefully, once again get back on track.

Hi~ands 
Any chance you'd be able to help fill in the attached chart with the specific location in the NY mansion where each device 
was recovered (similar to the chart you sent me for the USVI devices), please? Once I get that, I can put together the 
revised warrant.

Date: Tue, 26 Oct 2021 23:49:21 +0000 
Hi=, 
Defense counsel has requested that we schedule an evidence inspection this week with the defendant present. We'd very 
much appreciate it if the marshals could produce the defendant to a proffer room this week at 
. Our 
understanding from 
copied here, is that the marshals have been producing defendants for meetings of this 
type. A CSO and a case agent will be present for the meeting. 
Could you please let us know what dates this week would work for the meeting? We are scheduling this with defense 
attorneys who are flying in from out of state, so would appreciate if you could let us know what dates work this week. 
Thanks very much, 
Assistant United States Attorney

During my in-person visit yesterday with Ms. Maxwell, the HEPA filters were not operating in the visiting 
room that I have been required 
to use, even when more than one attorney is present. The officers told me to use the larger, corner room. 
Previous requests to use this more ample corner room have been denied because the officers' claim 
the camera cannot be positioned. Yesterday, the officers simply and easily positioned the camera focused on the 
corner room. 
I am requesting that future in-person visits be conducted in the larger corner room. 
The previous reason for denying that request appears invalid.

Defense counsel has requested that we schedule an evidence inspection this week with the defendant present. We'd very 
much appreciate it if the marshals could produce the defendant to a proffer room this week at 500 Pearl Street. Our 
understanding from Eric Blachman, copied here, is that the marshals have been producing defendants for meetings of this 
type. A CSO and a case agent will be present for the meeting. 
Could you please let us know what dates this week would work for the meeting? We are scheduling this with defense 
attorneys who are flying in from out of state, so would appreciate if you could let us know what dates work this week. 
Thanks very much,

A. Public Corruption Unit 
The Public Corruption Unit, consisting of about 20 AUSAs, including two supervisors, had 
a busy year focusing on both traditional corruption offenses and other abuses of power by-both 
local and national in scope. The Unit charged numerous law enforcement and correctional officers 
in the New York City area with various abuses of power, including an excessive force prosecution 
involving a mentally disturbed homeless victim, and multiple federal correctional officers, 
including one who has since pled guilty to sexually assaulting numerous female inmates under his 
watch. The Unit also brought charges of national significance, including campaign finance and 
related charges against Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, among others; extortion and fraud charges 
against attorney Michael Avenatti, and sex trafficking charges against former financier Jeffrey 
Epstein. 
At the local level, the Unit successfully prosecuted both local and federal officials, 
including a former NYPD Detective who used his position to facilitate a scheme to steal tens of 
thousands of dollars from dozens of New York victims. U.S. v. Bonanno, 18 Cr. 427 (PGG). 
Another police officer, Robert Espinel, became the final defendant to plead guilty in the unit's 
multi-case prosecution of officials at the NYPD's gun licensing division for accepting bribes to 
approve and expedite gun licenses. U.S. v. Robert Espinel, 17 Cr. 398 (ER). The Unit also brought 
charges against a sitting Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice for obstructing a federal investigation 
into fraud and corruption at the Municipal Credit Unit ("MCU") whose board she chaired. U.S. v. 
Ash, 19 Cr. 780 (LAK). Finally, the Unit brought charges against three federal correctional officers 
at the MCC, one for abusing his position to sexually assault numerous female inmates under his 
watch over a multi-year period, U.S. v. Akparanta, 19 Cr. 363 (LGS), and two for falsifying records 
intended to conceal their failure to conduct routine rounds and checks on the night Jeffrey Epstein, 
then an inmate at the MCC, committed suicide. U.S. v. Noel et at, 19 Cr. 830 (AT). 
At the national level, the unit brought campaign finance and related charges against four 
defendants, including Lev Pamas and Igor Fruman, based on their participation in a scheme to 
funnel money to political candidates and committees in the hope of gaining access and influence, 
including with respect to their efforts to cause the removal of the then-U.S. Ambassador to 
Ukraine. US. v. Panics, 19 Cr. 725 (JPO). The unit also charged Stephen Calk, the CEO and 
Chairman of the Federal Savings Bank in Chicago. with bank bribery in connection with financing 
he provided to Paul Manafort with the intent of securing a position within the Trump 
administration. U.S v. Calk, 19 Cr. 366 (LGS). The unit also successfully prosecuted the operator 
of a fraudulent political action committee ("PAC") for defrauding tens of thousands of victims into 
making what they believed to be political or cause-specific contributions under false pretenses, 
obtaining over $1.5 million in restitution and forfeiture for victims at sentencing. U.S. v. Tierney, 
Cr. 804 (JMF). In addition, the unit charged a second individual with 
wire fraud in connection with his efforts to steal money from individuals who thought they were 
donating to prominent political figures such as Bernie Sanders and Beto O'Rourke. U.S. v. 
DuPont, 19 Cr. 791 (ER). Finally, the unit charged and secured a guilty plea from Natalie 
Mayflower Sours Edwards. a previous high level official at the Financial Crimes Enforcement 
Network of the Treasury Department, with the unauthorized leaking of suspicious activity reports. 
U.S. v. Edwards, 19 Cr. 64 (GWR).

The Unit's work in 2019 extended beyond the traditional realm of public officials. In early 
2019, the Unit brought novel extortion charges against attorney Michael Avenatti for attempting 
to extort tens of millions of dollars from the athletic apparel company, Nike. U.S. v. Avenatti, 19 
Cr. 373 (PGG). Avenatti was also charged in a separate scheme to defraud his former client 
Stephanie Clifford ailda "Stormy Daniels," who had been the recipient of hush money payments 
in connection with the unit's earlier prosecution of Michael Cohen U.S. v. Avenatti, 19 Cr. 374 
(JMF). In July 2019, the unit brought sex trafficking charges against the former financier Jeffrey 
Epstein who over a multi-year period abused dozens of minor victims in New York, Florida and 
other locations. U.S. v. Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 (RMB). While Epstein committed suicide while 
awaiting trial, at a unique hearing held in connection with the entry of an order of nolle prosequi, 
dozens of Epstein's victims were afforded an opportunity to address the Court and publicly 
confront their abuser. Finally, in 2019, the Unit successfully completed its prosecution of three 
cases stemming from corruption in the world of college basketball, including trying to verdict 
bribery charges against two defendants for making cash payments to university coaches. U.S. v. 
Evans, 17 Cr. 684 (ER), US. v. Person, 17 Cr. 683 (LAP).

Judge Nathan - 
Pursuant to this Court's Order of April 20, 2021 (Dkt. 221), attached please find counsel's Letter Motion for an 
Adjournment of the trial. 
Counsel for Ms. Maxwell request redaction of their other clients' names and case numbers from this Letter Motion 
pursuant to Rule of Professional Conduct 1.6 which prohibits lawyers from revealing confidential information related to a 
client even where that information is publicly available. See In Re. Anonymous, 654 N.E. 2.d. 1128 (Ind. 1995) (lawyer 
violated Rule 1.6 by disclosing information relating to representation of client, even though information "was readily 
available from public sources and not confidential in nature"); In re Bryan, 61 P.3d 641 (Kan. 2003) (lawyer violated Rule 
1.6 by disclosing, in court documents, existence of defamation suit against former client); State ex rel. Okla. Bor Ass'n v. 
McGee, 48 P.3d 787, 791 (Okla. 2002) (a lawyer's duty of confidentiality attaches "to all information relating to the 
representation, whatever its source"). 
Upon direction of the Court, counsel will file either the redacted or unredacted version of this letter on the public docket.

Thank you! The issue with production 11 is that defense counsel has expressed difficulty reviewing the metadata on the 
images contained in the production. In particular, the FBI created the attached spreadsheet, which listed the metadata 
the FBI was able to extract from the images, but defense counsel has indicated they have no way of knowing which bates 
numbered image in the production corresponds with which row in the spreadsheet. I'm hoping there's something in the 
production we can point them to that will help them match up each bates number with each row in the spreadsheet.

Attached is a draft of the factual statement, just so that you can better understand the 
facts that we are presenting. 
We feel that given 
abuse, and given the fact that we see her basically as a 
cog in Epstein's wheel, acting entirely at his direction and doing what she did at a time 
that she herself was a very vulnerable victim, a non-pros would be the appropriate 
disposition. But we want to discuss this with you before we finalize this and make a 
submission. 
Thanks, Susan

John, 
Wanted to get back to you regarding your letter of March 9, 2020, which we received via the Eastern District U.S. 
Attorney's Office, and your follow-up call this week, both of which we appreciate. We did receive the letter, and in the 
first instance it would be helpful to know the name and contact info of the person who's the source of this information 
(assuming it is someone other than you) — we ordinarily pass this kind of information to the FBI for initial response, but it's 
not clear from the letter whom they would be in touch with to follow up. It would also be helpful to know, if you're 
aware, whether there is any allegation that the relevant interns were underage. 
thanks very much, 
M

crimes, respectively. The investigation arises from conduct alleged to have occurred from in or 
about the 1990s. In parallel, we are considering filing civil forfeiture actions against Epstein 
properties used by Epstein and Maxwell to facilitate their criminal conduct, which are 
collectively worth in excess of $100 million. 
Epstein is alleged to have engaged in a years-long pattern of enticing minor girls to 
engage in sex acts, aided and abetted and facilitated by Maxwell. Epstein undertook this conduct 
in at least New York, Florida, the U.S. Virgin Islands, New Mexico, and certain cities abroad. 
We estimate that there are at least 50 victims who were abused by Epstein in New York, 
Florida and elsewhere, and who currently live throughout the United States and abroad, and 
several whose abuse was facilitated by Maxwell. Significant investigative costs include 
significant travel to interview victims and witnesses, and data hosting and discovery support 
relating from voluminous records obtained from dozens of devices obtained via search warrants, 
among other discovery costs.

Hi 
I just had a quick question about how to mark a couple of these documents. For some reason USPV00341820-26 were 
blank. I tried clicking image and extracted text and those didn't help. Also, for the documents USVP00341831-51, skipping 
some here and there, they said "Browser does not support this multimedia format". I marked all of these "For further 
review", is this how you want them marked or do you want me to change that to something else? 
Thank you,

Thanks—I think it would help to even more expressly note that the document is not comprehensive (for example, this 
spreadsheet doesn't list the yearbooks, so it sounds like it's missing more recent evidence). Proposed addition below. 
To my knowledge, that is the only excel spreadsheet in our possession that indexes physical evidence related to this case, 
but this is not a comprehensive document. The discovery productions also included search warrant returns listing the 
physical items seized by the FBI's New York Office during the 2019 searches of Jeffrey Epstein's residences in New York and 
the U.S Virgin Islands, but they are not contained in a spreadsheet. 
As a courtesy, I have asked the FBI whether it would be possible to provide us with a similar excel index reflecting the 
physical evidence seized by the FBI's New York Office, though it may take some time to complete such an index.

In advance of our call tomorrow, I wanted to send a copy of the attached index of physical items in FBI custody from the 
FBI-Miami office, which we previously produced to you as part of our August 21, 2020 discovery production. Also 
included in that August 21, 2020 production were scans of numerous items listed on the index. Those scans can be found

not include every physical item currently in the FBI's custody related to this case. For example, the August 20, 2020

Hi M, 
Thanks very much for chatting this afternoon. To recap: 
• By tomorrow: Please check to see whether it would be possible to prepare all of the "HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL" 
nude/partially nude images and videos from the search of Epstein's devices for Maxwell and her counsel to review 
at 500 Pearl by next Wednesday or Thursday. If that is not feasible, please let me know how much time you need 
to prepare those materials for review. 
• Please confirm that the only categories of "HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL" nude/partially nude images in our custody that 
have not been produced to the defense are (1) the images seized from Epstein's NY and USVI residences, which 
were already loaded onto a laptop and brought by the FBI to the MDC for Maxwell to review, and (2) the images 
and videos seized from Epstein's devices. 
• Attached is the inventory you all provided us detailing the physical evidence items from the FBI-Florida 
investigation. Please confirm that no items from the Florida case are missing from this index. 
• Please provide us with a similar inventory of all physical evidence items in FBI-NY custody gathered during our 
investigation. 
• Please work with 
to figure out the logistics of how to allow defense counsel and (where possible) Maxwell 
at 500 Pearl Street to review the physical items in the FBI's custody.

Counsel, 
In advance of our call tomorrow, I wanted to send a copy of the attached index of physical items in FBI custody from the 
FBI-Miami office, which we previously produced to you as part of our August 21, 2020 discovery production. Also 
included in that August 21, 2020 production were scans of numerous items listed on the index. Those scans can be found 
within Bates range SDNY_GM_00172218-SDNY_GM_00173007. It may be useful to reference some of those items during 
our conversation tomorrow, so I wanted to make sure you were aware of them.

On the plus side, it would appear that all of these are recent and pertain (in general terms) to the 
Epstein investigation we all did and that you are intimately familiar with. Do we have a way of compiling a list of the 
requests made to Civ Div and handled by them? They must have a FOIA coordinator or something like that...

FYI...is list has about sixteen cases. I've askeclMto check his records to see if there are more. When we have the 
full list, 
and I will check in with you to see where we should go from here. Two things to note for now: 
• One of these FOIA requests is from Boies Schiller, and the log notes that BSF has made multiple requests, 
including to other districts. 
• This list only includes FOIA requests directed to our office. It does not include FOIA lawsuits our civil division has 
handled, based on FOIA requests to other governmental components (for example, the Radar Online case 
referenced in Maxwell's letter).

That would be a big help. Please let us know if you need any information from us to run the search.

U.S. Department of Justice 
United States Attorney 
Southern District of New York 
June 7, 2021 
BY ECF 
The Honorable Alison J. Nathan 
United States District Court 
Southern District of New York 
United States Courthouse 
Re: 
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
The Government respectfully submits this letter to provide an update regarding the 
defendant's conditions of confinement at the Metropolitan Detention Center ("MDC") pursuant to 
the Court's Order dated December 8, 2020. (Dkt. No. 92). This update is based on information 
provided to the Government by MDC legal counsel regarding the conditions of the defendant's 
confinement over the last two months. 
The defendant continues to receive more time to review discovery than any other inmate 
at the MDC. Specifically, the defendant is permitted to review her discovery thirteen hours per 
day, seven days per week. During the entirety of that time, the defendant still has access to both a 
desktop computer provided by the MDC and a laptop computer provided by the Government on 
which to review discovery. Also during those thirteen hours per day, the defendant may use the 
MDC desktop computer to send and receive emails with her attorneys. This discovery review 
takes place in a day room that is separate from the defendant's assigned cell. Accordingly, the 
defendant continues to be permitted out of her cell from 7am to 8pm every day. While in the day 
room, the defendant continues to have exclusive access to the MDC desktop computer, the laptop, 
a television, a phone on which to place social or attorney calls, and a shower. The defendant is 
EFTA00025219
--- PAGE 2 ---
Page 2 
also permitted outdoor recreation every day. although she has the option of declining such 
recreation time if she wishes. 
The defendant also continues to receive as much, if not more, time as any other MDC 
inmate to communicate with her attorneys. Currently, the defendant receives five hours of video-
teleconference ("VTC") calls with her counsel every weekday, for a total of 25 hours of attorney 
VTC calls per week. All of these VTC calls take place in a room where the defendant is alone and 
where no MDC staff can hear her communications with counsel. During these VTC calls, MDC 
staff place a camera approximately 30 feet away from the door to the room where the defendant 
conducts the VTC calls. The camera has a full view of the door to the VTC room, but the camera 
does not capture any sound from the defendant's VTC calls with her attorneys. The defendant is 
also permitted to use the phone in the day room to place phone calls to her attorneys as needed. 
In addition, the defendant receives in-person visits from her attorneys as needed on 
weekends. These meetings take place in a room where the defendant is alone with her counsel and 
where no MDC staff can hear the defendant's communications with counsel. During these visits, 
MDC staff place a camera approximately 30 feet away from the door to the attorney visit room. 
The camera has a full view of the door to the attorney visit room, but the camera does not capture 
any sound from the defendant's meetings with her counsel. 
Like any other inmate, the defendant is patted down by MDC staff whenever she is moved 
to a different part of the facility. As part of every pat-down search, the defendant is required to 
open her mouth briefly so that MDC staff can confirm she has not hidden contraband in her mouth. 
These pat-down and mouth searches continue to be consistent with MDC's policy that all inmates 
be searched whenever they move to a different location within the jail facility. Also like all other 
inmates, after each in-person visit she receives, the defendant is strip searched. 
EFTA00025220
--- PAGE 3 ---
Page 3 
After any in-person visit the defendant receives, MDC staff conduct a body scan of the 
defendant, which is a non-invasive machine scan, to check for any secreted contraband. MDC 
staff also search the defendant's cell for contraband approximately once per day. Finally, as 
discussed in detail in the Government's May 5, 2021 letter (Dkt. No. 270), MDC staff conduct 
wellness checks on the defendant every fifteen minutes at night to confirm that the defendant is 
breathing. The MDC continues to be of the view that all of these searches are necessary for the 
safety of the institution and the defendant, including for the reasons detailed in the Government's 
May 5, 2021 letter. 
MDC medical staff and psychology staff continue to monitor the defendant daily. Most 
recently, MDC medical staff weighed the defendant on June 3, 2021 and found that she weighs 
approximately 138 pounds. MDC medical staff continue to assess that the defendant is physically 
healthy. 
Should the Court have any questions or require any additional details regarding this topic, 
the Government will promptly provide additional information. 
Respectfully submitted, 
United States Attorney

Good afternoon 
and 
I hope this email finds you well. I have attached the draft interview questions for 
for your review. This is still a draft 
and will certainly be edited prior to the interview. However, I wanted to give you both enough time to review the 
questions so that you were able to make any edits and/or suggestions that you feel appropriate prior to the interview. I 
only ask that you make your edits in track changes so that I am clear on what it is you have changed. I have also attached 
the forms which we, as Dal OIG agents, are required to provide to all employees at the start of their Subject interview. 
Per our conversation, it is my understanding that we will be utilizing the Voluntary Interview Form, but I also wanted to 
provide you with the Compelled Interview Form, in case you wanted to compare the two to be certain we are all of the 
same understanding. Finally, we received guidance that we are required to record the interviews, so please let me know if 
you know (or believe) this to be a problem so that we may address the issue prior to the interview(s). 
Thanks very much in advance. I hope you're both having a nice day.

We just found out yesterday that we're being sent to Florida for an FBI-arranged meeting with victims in the Epstein case, 
so again in connection with that investigation (2018R01618), I'd like to please request permission to travel on Monday to 
Florida and back. Unfortunately because of scheduling I expect I'll need to fly down and back both on Monday (and back 
in time to make an afternoon flight to Tennessee for a separate work obligation), but it's possible 
may need to go if 
we can't get the scheduling. In any event, we're requesting approval for travel for one person for either zero nights or one 
night, and no need for a conference room for this trip. 
thanks very much,

In our call today with counsel for the respective Trustees of the Epstein estate, they asked that we convey a request to 
meet with =, 
and anyone else she would want to include in such a meeting, to discuss the Trustees' interest in 
resolving the Government's potential civil forfeiture claims against the estate. They said they appreciated our (the line 
assistants') willingness to hear their regular updates, but that they understand we're not in a position to negotiate, or 
even to provide feedback on the proposed plan for the fund, and so they'd like the opportunity to elevate that discussion 
and convey why they believe it would be in all parties' interests, including the victims, to engage in meaningful discussions 
about a possible resolution. When you've spoken with =, 
could you please let us know whether she's willing to meet 
with them? And we can convey the response, unless you and/or she would prefer to do so directly. If she is willing to 
meet with them, they were hoping to put a date and time on the calendar as soon as is convenient for her after the 
holiday. 
thanks,

Without conceding that these materials constitute discoverable materials pursuant to Rule

Attorney's Eyes' Only 
The Government recognizes its obligations under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), 
and its progeny. The Government wishes to bring your attention to the following statements, 
which could constitute Brady material: 
• 
Inmate-4 stated that on the night of August 9, 2019, the corrections officers 
performed "a few rounds that night" but Inmate-4 could not recall what time. 
• 
Inmate-5 stated that Noel came by "around 10 to do the count" on the evening of 
August 9, 2019. 
• 
Inmate-7 stated that on the evening of August 9, 2019, the corrections officers "did 
[a] count around 1 0ish but not after that." Inmate-7 further stated that Inmate-7 
was not really awake for the 3:00 a.m. count on August 10, 2019, "but hear[d] [the] 
gate open." 
This range excludes SDNY_00007661-SDNY_00007665, which the court has directed the 
Government to wtihhold.

• 
Inmate-11 stated that on the evening of August 9, 2019 into the morning of August 
10, 2019, the "last check was made sometime between 12:30Am — 1:00AM. The 
male black stayed by the door and the female black walked through the tier but did 
not walk all the way in." 
In addition, materials from Inmate-2 include a statement which could constitute Brady, however, 
the Court has directed the Government to withhold these materials from production due to pending 
ex parse litigation. The Government will produce these materials if and when the Court orders 
their production. Beyond the above materials, to date, the Government is unaware of any other 
Brady material regarding your client, but will provide timely disclosure if any such material comes 
to light. The Government will provide material under Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 154 
(1972), and its progeny, to the extent it has not already been produced, in a timely manner prior to 
trial. 
II. 
Materials Not Disclosed 
In addition to the materials identified above, the Government is in possession of additional 
records that are not discovery materials under Rule 16(a). Nonetheless, in an abundance of caution, 
the Government is providing the following inventory of those materials that have not been 
produced: 
• 
Financial records produced by Bank of America for accounts in the names of 
• 
Financial records produced by Citibank for accounts in the names of-
and
•

If at any time you believe that any of the foregoing materials should be produced as Rule 
16(a) materials, please promptly notify the Government. 
III. 
Disclosure by the Defendant 
In light of your request for the foregoing discovery, the Government hereby requests 
reciprocal discovery under Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(b). Specifically, we request that you allow 
inspection and copying of: (1) any books, or copies or portions thereof, which are in the 
defendant's possession, custody or control, and which the defendant intends to introduce as 
evidence or otherwise rely on at trial; and (2) any results or reports of physical or mental 
examinations and of scientific tests or experiments made in connection with this case, or copies 
thereof, which are in the defendant's possession or control, and which the defendant intends to 
introduce as evidence or otherwise rely on at trial or which were prepared by a witness whom the 
defendant intends to call at trial. 
The Government also requests that the defendant disclose prior statements of witnesses he 
will call to testify. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 26.2; United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225 (1975). We 
request that such material be provided on the same basis upon which we agree to supply the 
defendant with 3500 material relating to Government witnesses. 
We also wish to remind you that Fed. R. Crim. P. 12.3(a) requires you to provide the 
Government with written notice if the defendant intends to claim a defense of actual or believed 
exercise of public authority on behalf of a law enforcement or Federal intelligence agency at the 
time of the alleged crime. 
The Government requests a response to our Rule 12.3 demand within the time period 
allowed by the Court for the filing of motions. 
IV. 
Sentence Reduction for Acceptance of Responsibility 
Please contact us at your earliest convenience concerning the possible disposition of this 
matter or any further discovery which you may request. This Office will oppose the additional 
one-point reduction under the Sentencing Guidelines available for defendants who plead prior to 
the Government's initiation of trial preparations pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1(b), in the event your 
client has not entered a plea of guilty four weeks prior to trial. We will follow this policy whether 
or not suppression or other pretrial motions remain outstanding after this date and even if the trial 
date has not been announced by the Court four weeks in advance of the trial.

Please be advised, however, that pursuant to the policy of the Office concerning plea offers, 
no plea offer is effective unless and until made in writing and signed by authorized representatives 
of the Office. In particular, discussions regarding the pretrial disposition of a matter that are not 
reduced to writing and signed by authorized representatives of the Office cannot and do not 
constitute a "formal offer" or a "plea offer," as those terms are used in Lafier v. Cooper, 132 S.Ct. 
1376 (2012); Missouri v. Frye, 132 S.Ct. 1399 (2012).

Unfortunately this is still incorrect. First, it has the nightly lodging costs listed as $248 when in fact it was $247 — see the 
invoice, which is attached again. (Or please let me know if I'm supposed to be reimbursed for the maximum daily 
allowance rather than the actual cost.) Also it still does not include the tax.

Good afternoon all, 
Alex, an Accounting Department representative just contacted me regarding the transient occupancy tax you were 
charged for your stay at Doubletree by Hilton Santa Monica, but unfortunately since you used your personal card to pay 
for the hotel, they are not authorized to remove the taxes from your bill. Sorry for the inconvenience. Let me know if you 
have further questions regarding your travel voucher for this trip.

Subject: RE: Final Voucher 10810414(1) prepared by a travel arranger is pending your review 
Date: Wed, 20 Nov 2019 17:40:03 +0000 
Hi Darlene, Please advise the AUSA re: if the hotel will refund the tax. Thanks 
Subject: RE: Final Voucher 10810414(1) prepared by a travel arranger is pending your review 
Unfortunately this is still incorrect. First, it has the nightly lodging costs listed as $248 when in fact it was $247 — see the 
invoice, which is attached again. (Or please let me know if I'm supposed to be reimbursed for the maximum daily 
allowance rather than the actual cost.) Also it still does not include the tax. 
Please let me know when it is corrected and I will review it again.

Good morning 
I wanted to follow up on a press release from your office from earlier this week entitled, " Acting U.S. 
Attorney Announces Charges Against Correctional Officer Who Demanded Bribe In The Form Of Sex From 
A Female Prison Visitor." 
The press release lists DOI OIG as a supporting law enforcement agency at the end of the release. 
However, I spoke with our Special Agent in Charge in New York and we believe we should have been listed 
as an announcing agency. Our contributions to this case were significant, and we'd ask that for future 
press releases, you include our SAC as an announcing official. Please feel free to reach out with any 
questions, I'm at 202-579-7511. 
Thank you.

stuff from 41 items. I have another 8 left. They are all Macs and have been problematic. I will beat on it again 
tomorrow. I was able to do the exports with 5 machines. I will be down to 2 for the remaining Mac stuff. Will

Good evening-
You failed to provide any update concerning the whereabouts of Ms. Maxwell's legal mail that I had placed in the legal 
mailbox on 10/2. 
However, on Friday afternoon, I was informed by Ms. Maxwell and Unit Manager 
that the envelope had 
been located and affixed to it 
was a bar-code type sticker, not generated by the MDC, but of the type issued by the U.S. Post Office. 
I had placed the envelope in the legal mailbox. It did not have postage. If, for some questionable reason, it had been 
handled by the U.S . Postal Service 
(which is highly unlikely and, if so, deliberately caused by the MDC), the Post Office would have returned it to my office 
address (at the return address on the envelope), 
not deliver it to the MDC without postage. 
This suggests some type of foul play on the part of the MDC, or at least some type of cover-up. 
I am informed that the Warden is aware of this. Today, I received the envelope from Unit Manager 
Today, Christian Everdell, Esq. and I had a scheduled legal visit with Ms. Maxwell. 
Rather than permitting us to use a somewhat larger room, we were required to use a room for two. 
This completely defeated the purpose of COVID protective measures. The plastic partition did not shield 
Mr. Everdell and there was little or no table surface for him to use. The room was unnecessarily cramped 
when a larger room was available. My request to use a larger room was denied. The officer claimed the team could not 
position the camera 
to focus on the larger room. This response was bogus. I requested to see the Warden, but that request was never 
honored. 
Further, defense counsel at large have heard about the current electricity issues affecting water, toilet flushing, and meals. 
Ms. Maxwell received a bologna sandwich despite being on no-flesh (vegetarian) diet. 
This is yet another blunder on the part of the MDC which needs to be immediately corrected. 
I will not waste my energy requesting a response because even if forthcoming it will likely be insufficient. 
These matters will be brought to the Court's attention, so you can start preparing excuses for consideration by Judge 
Nathan. 
Enjoy your holiday.

Thanks for letting us know. And sorry you have to receive these emails. I think this is certainly better handled by 
the court than us as we have no control over theses issues. Since 
was copied I'm sure she is 
handling up her chain. Does anyone have any other thoughts? Happy to discuss if you'd like.

Re: 
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
Dear Counsel: 
Today the Government is producing materials, including Jencks Act and Giglio 
material, regarding the witnesses who may be called to testify at trial in the above-referenced case. 
Enclosed please find an index detailing the materials included in today's production. 
The Government notes that the records stamped 3522-004 reflect tha 
testified in the grand jury in connection with the investigation conducted by the Pam eac 
tate s 
Attorney's Office, but the clerk of court has c 
Government that the audio files are 
unplayable and, therefore, there is no record o 
nd jury testimony. 
The Government is also producing today certain materials relating to individuals the 
Government does not currently intend to call as witnesses at trial in the above-referenced case. 
These materials do not contain a comprehensive set of Jencks Act and Giglio materials, as the 
Government does not expect to call these individuals to testify at trial. Instead, these materials 
contain, among other things, certain witness statements. Enclosed please find an index detailing 
these materials. This production should not be taken to indicate that the Government believes it 
EFTA00025287
--- PAGE 2 ---
Page 2 
has any obligation to provide all of these materials; rather, we make this production as a courtesy. 
Moreover, although the Government presently does not intend to call the individuals listed in the 
enclosed index, we reserve the right to do so and will notify you should the Government determine 
that it intends to call any of these individuals at trial. 
miii 
The Govern 
' 
highlight for you a particular portion of statements made 
by non-testifying witness 
about Minor Victim-4. In particul 
viously 
stated to law enforcement in 
t 
sum an substance, that Minor Victim-4 introduced 
o Jeffrey 
M
i and instructed
 to tell Epstein that 
was 18 years old. These statements by 
are contained in the Government's non-testy prig witness productions, including in the first 
such production dated April 12, 2021 (see, e.g., 3501.149-023 at I; 3501.149-026 at 9; and 
3501.149-024 between approximately timestamp 04:20 and timestamp 07:30). 
Please note that this letter, the enclosed indices, and the enclosed materials are 
governed by the July 31, 2020 Protective Order in this case. In particular, the entire production 
is designated as "confidential" under the Protective Order. The index is itself designated as 
"confidential," because it includes information regarding records designated as 
"confidential" under the Protective Order. The Department of Justice directed this office to 
cease the dissemination of materials marked with the word "confidential" in order to avoid 
potential confusion with markings reserved for classified documents. Accordingly, in order to 
note the appropriate designation of this production under the operative Protective Order in this 
case, the materials being produced today are marked with the following label: "SUBJECT TO 
PROTECTIVE ORDER PARAGRAPHS 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, and 17." This marking directly refers to 
the specific paragraphs of the Protective Order that govern today's production. 
Additionally, please note that many of the individuals referenced in this production are 
represented by counsel, as detailed in the enclosed indices. The Government reserves its right to 
amend and supplement these disclosures. 
The Government also writes to notify you of the following matters regarding certain 
witnesses that the Government may call to testify at trial in the above-referenced case:

Hi Sigrid, 
We wanted to follow up in connection with 
— our supervisors have asked us to do an additional interview with her, 
both to follow up on some specific aspects of her recollection but also do basically go through her experiences again. As 
I'm sure you know, we have no doubts whatsoever, at all, about her candor and truthfulness in our previous interview, 
which also was broadly consistent with what she has said in other interviews, but we are nevertheless hoping she might 
be willing to speak with us sometime in the next week or two? Obviously due to the current situation we would plan to 
do it via phone, and we would be happy to chat about logistics with you if that would be helpful, or to answer any

questions at all. And if 
is willing to speak with us again, we're happy to work around her schedule, including talking 
during an evening or weekend if that's easier for her than during the day—whatever you and she would prefer. 
Please let us know if any questions, or if it would be useful to chat, and thanks very much.

asked her to take a copy of the front and back of the journal book which she did. Hope this helps. Please let 
me know if you need anything else: 
"The shortest page and the one that is the hardest to read is the first entry from 12/95. It is written in colored 
pencil and is fading. There are then two pages from 01/07/1996 where I talk about the highlights of my NY

movies with him."

Hi Sigrid, 
follow-up request 
Hope you had a wonderful holida season and very happy New Year. We wanted to follow up on a request we 
made after interviewing 
a few months ago. During her interview, 
referred to several 
entries in her journal that had helped refresh her recollection of the events involving Epstein and Maxwell. As 
we mentioned at the end of the interview, it would be very helpful to our investigation if we could review 
those journal entries, as well as any other records or documents 
may have that relate to her experiences 
with Epstein and Maxwell. 
Would

have) to assist in our investigation? 
Happy to have a call to discuss if that would be helpful.

I unfortunately was on trial during the previous interview, but I think somewhat less time than how long it went last time. 
Ordinarily we try not to go longer than about 90 minutes in any event, so I think if she is able to block out that amount of 
time, that would be great — and we'll try to be as efficient as possible and hopefully take less than that. If that sounds 
alright?

that works for them, and we hope to be able to confirm with you in the next couple hours. 
thanks,

Hello 
— 
said she has time tomorrow if that would work for you team. She is in Texas so an hour behind us. I 
would like to be on the call as well. Would it work to do something tomorrow at 11:00 EST? Let me know. If that does not 
work I can try to get other times.

I unfortunately was on trial during the previous interview, but I think somewhat less time than how long it went last time. 
Ordinarily we try not to go longer than about 90 minutes in any event, so I think if she is able to block out that amount of 
time, that would be great — and we'll try to be as efficient as possible and hopefully take less than that. If that sounds 
alright?

I am sure

and find a time that works. How much time do you think she should allot for the interview — just so she can plan?

Hi Sigrid, 
We wanted to follow up in connection with 
— our supervisors have asked us to do an additional interview with her, 
both to follow up on some specific aspects of her recollection but also do basically go through her experiences again. As 
I'm sure you know, we have no doubts whatsoever, at all, about her candor and truthfulness in our previous interview, 
which also was broadly consistent with what she has said in other interviews, but we are nevertheless hoping she might 
be willing to speak with us sometime in the next week or two? Obviously due to the current situation we would plan to 
do it via phone, and we would be happy to chat about logistics with you if that would be helpful, or to answer any 
questions at all. And if 
is willing to speak with us again, we're happy to work around her schedule, including talking 
during an evening or weekend if that's easier for her than during the day—whatever you and she would prefer. 
Please let us know if any questions, or if it would be useful to chat, and thanks very much.

Hello — attached are the pages 
sent me to provide to you. Here is a bit of an explanation and I also 
asked her to take a copy of the front and back of the journal book which she did. Hope this helps. Please let 
me know if you need anything else: 
"The shortest page and the one that is the hardest to read is the first entry from 12/95. It is written in colored 
pencil and is fading. There are then two pages from 01/07/1996 where I talk about the highlights of my NY 
trip and going to Epstein's house and then the next entry from 01/25/1996 is where I talk about going to the 
movies with him."

time period when she was with Epstein/Maxwell. I will ask her about the journal ASAP and will get back to

Hi Sigrid, 
Hope you had a wonderful holida season and very happy New Year. We wanted to follow up on a request we 
made after interviewing 
a few months ago. During her interview, 
referred to several 
entries in her journal that had helped refresh her recollection of the events involving Epstein and Maxwell. As 
we mentioned at the end of the interview, it would be very helpful to our investigation if we could review 
those journal entries, as well as any other records or documents 
may have that relate to her experiences 
with Epstein and Maxwell. 
Would 
be willing to share with us any relevant journal entries (or any other relevant documents she may 
have) to assist in our investigation? 
Happy to have a call to discuss if that would be helpful. 
Thank you,

Tomorrow morning would actually be fine — we'll send you a calendar invite for 11:00 a.m. Eastern time, including a 
conference line number, and we'll plan to talk with you then. And just as a heads up, not that I particularly expect this will 
be necessary, but similar to how we always tell witnesses that if they want to talk with their counsel privately during an in-
person meeting, we'll let her know that the same thing holds true for over the phone as well, that you two can always 
have a side call at any point! And otherwise I think it will be the usual awkwardness of phone but hopefully not too bad.

Hi Sigrid, 
We wanted to follow up in connection with 
— our supervisors have asked us to do an additional interview with her, 
both to follow up on some specific aspects of her recollection but also do basically go through her experiences again. As 
I'm sure you know, we have no doubts whatsoever, at all, about her candor and truthfulness in our previous interview, 
which also was broadly consistent with what she has said in other interviews, but we are nevertheless hoping she might 
be willing to speak with us sometime in the next week or two? Obviously due to the current situation we would plan to 
do it via phone, and we would be happy to chat about logistics with you if that would be helpful, or to answer any 
questions at all. And if 
is willing to speak with us again, we're happy to work around her schedule, including talking 
during an evening or weekend if that's easier for her than during the day—whatever you and she would prefer. 
Please let us know if any questions, or if it would be useful to chat, and thanks very much.

Let me follow up with 
about her journal. I know she shared some pictures with you from around the 
time period when she was with Epstein/Maxwell. I will ask her about the journal ASAP and will get back to 
you and will check with her to see if she has anything else that might be helpful to the investigation.

Hi Sigrid, 
follow-up request 
Hope you had a wonderful holida season and very happy New Year. We wanted to follow up on a request we 
made after interviewing 
a few months ago. During her interview, 
referred to several 
entries in her journal that had helped refresh her recollection of the events involving Epstein and Maxwell. As 
we mentioned at the end of the interview, it would be very helpful to our investigation if we could review 
those journal entries, as well as any other records or documents 
may have that relate to her experiences 
with Epstein and Maxwell. 
Would 
be willing to share with us any relevant journal entries (or any other relevant documents she may 
have) to assist in our investigation? 
Happy to have a call to discuss if that would be helpful. 
Thank

We just found out yesterday that we're being sent to Florida for an FBI-arranged meeting with victims in the Epstein case, 
so again in connection with that investigation (2018R01618), I'd like to please request permission to travel on Monday to 
Florida and back. Unfortunately because of scheduling I expect I'll need to fly down and back both on Monday (and back 
in time to make an afternoon flight to Tennessee for a separate work obligation), but it's possible 
may need to go if 
we can't get the scheduling. In any event, we're requesting approval for travel for one person for either zero nights or one 
night, and no need for a conference room for this trip. 
thanks very much,

The taint team here apparently received materials from the search of the New York house but it's way fewer 
documents than we would have expected. Can you please let us know exactly how many electronic devices (phones, 
computers, hard drives, thumb drives, and/or discs) were sent to CART for processing, and how many were in fact 
processed and sent back to us? Or if it's easier to just put us in touch with the CART people directly, that's fine too. 
My understanding was that they were processing the materials in the attached, which appears to list approximately 
computers and/or electronic storage devices seized along with an additional approximately 55 CDs.

We have a number of meetings today—I believe we could do a call anytime up until 2:30 pm, and then likely not 
again until approximately 8 pm or later, but both subject to confirmation with the team. We're also relatively free 
tomorrow. Could you give us a sense of the topic and the urgency?

Thank you for your prompt response. We will advise our client accordingly. 
As for scheduling, can we plan for August 28 with the hope that your trial will be over by then (or perhaps will 
be in jury deliberations such lam 
et
 a meeting)? If it turns out that your trial isn't over by then, 
perhaps we can still meet with 
and 
that day. Please let us know if that would work. 
Many thanks,

First, and most importantly, to the extent your client or any of her family, friends, loved ones, etc., feel 
threatened by any communications or other actions, they should not hesitate to immediately report that to 
authorities, whether local police, the local FBI office, and/or any other appropriate law enforcement. If your 
client or anyone else believes at any time that they may be in imminent danger, they should immediately call 
911. Their reporting threats to authorities will not interfere with or otherwise impact our investigation and we in 
no way want to impede any legal steps they wish to take to ensure their safety. Please let us know if you have 
any questions about this at all, as we do not want there to be any confusion or miscommunication about the 
importance of individuals being able to ensure their safety. 
Regarding a follow-up meeting, I unfortunately have a short trial starting August 26. Would it be possible to 
meet sometime this coming week, rather than the following? I expect we also could make ourselves available on 
a weekend day if that would be helpful, or we could set a time later in the week of the 26th. Or if none of that 
works, please let us know and we'll further confer internally about options. 
thank you,

Thanks for your time on the phone yesterday. Please let us know if you are available to meet on Monday, 
August 26, or Tuesday, August 27, to continue our discussions and attorney proffer. 
Also, I know you had limited time yesterday (and apologies for going over my initial estimate for the call), but 
one of the thhgs I ad intended to share with you are some of the threatening communications that have been 
received by 
husband. Attached is an example of a recent one. We don't want to do anything that may 
impact your ongoing investigation, so defer to you as to what should be done with respect to this. 
Thanks and we look forward to hearing from you as to your availability for a meeting. 
Best,

Following up on the below and our brief conversation this afternoon, you're absolutely correct that I had said 
we'd send transcripts of the court proceedings thus far; they are attached. 
EFTA00025370
--- PAGE 17 ---
You also had asked about additional information about written or otherwise recorded messages from (or in 
connection with, or referencing) victims. While we're not currently in a position to provide additional detail 
about those particular records (in terms of identifying information on those records themselves), we can give you 
related information that is more specific and I think may be more helpful. Separate from the messages, we have 
contemporaneous telephone records, including records from a cell phone that was registered to your client, in her 
name -- those cell phone records reflect numerous phone contacts with multiple girls who were underage at the 
time of the calls.

Following up on our conversations last week and esterda , and in response to our email, we are available to 
meet with ou and 
next week 
As we covered on the phone yesterday, you should feel free to reach out to any of us on the team if you have any 
questions as you meet with your client, and thank you in advance for copying all of our team on email 
communications, as we also discussed. I think I also said that we would send you the docket numbers of the 
primary civil cases, which are 15 Civ. 7433 (RWS) (SDNY), 17 Civ. 616 (JGK) (SDNY), and 08 Civ. 80736 
(SDFL) (the CVRA litigation). I believe there are also a number of docketed civil cases involving Mr. Epstein in 
federal court in Florida, and there may also be additional state cases. 
Separately, I don't recall if I said we would send this, but in case it is useful for your consideration, attached is an 
example of our standard proffer agreement. 
In terms of scheduling, next week we are available at 2:30 on Monday; anytime on Tuesday except for 12:30 to 
1:30; and at either 9:30 a.m. or 5:00 p.m. on Wednesday, due to a court conference and other meetings during the 
day. 
Please let us know if we're forgetting anything or if any additional information would be useful, and we look 
forward to being in touch soon.

Hey, so unfortunately the open-source website that tracked private planes (even those that paid to be de-listed on public 
trackers, such as your target jet) is currently down as of just a couple days ago: 
https://adsbexchange.com/flight-data-sql-archive/ 
If it comes back up, may be of use, otherwise you may have to rely on international flight records. 
And pros memo attached, as promised — again, don't hesitate to be in touch if anything else would be useful, whether in 
the near term or further along in your investigation. Good luck!

Subject: NY Judge Rips 'Terrible' Conditions At NYC Federal Jails - Law360 
Date: Wed, 06 May 2020 11:46:16 +0000 
NY Judge Rips 'Terrible' Conditions At NYC Federal Jails 
By Stewart Bishop 
Share us on: 
Law360, New York (May 5, 2020, 9:12 PM 
EDT) -- A New York federal judge on Tuesday 
derided the "unfortunate, terrible" conditions 
at New York City's two main federal jails, both 
before and after the coronavirus pandemic, 
during a hearing where he sentenced an 
admitted fraudster who tried to steal $2.5 
million from a law firm to time served. 
U.S. District Judge Richard M. Berman 
criticized the "deficient system" at the 
Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn 
and said he "has serious doubts" about the 
ability of the Metropolitan Correctional Center 
in Manhattan to safely and properly house its 
detainees. 
Judge Berman, who presided over the 
criminal sex trafficking case against Jeffrey 
Epstein until his suicide at the MCC in 
August, said he was very disappointed that to 
his knowledge, U.S. Attorney General William 
Barr has not conducted a thorough 
assessment and investigation of the Bureau 
of Prisons nationwide, something he said 
Barr pledged to do around the time of 
Epstein's suicide. 
https://www.law360.corn/articles/1270636/ny-judge-
rips-terrible-conditions-at-nyc-federal-jails 
EFTA00025383
--- PAGE 2 ---
In particular, Judge Berman said as far as he 
knows, there have been no serious reviews 
forthcoming of the poor living conditions at 
either the MCC or the MDC — which he said 
are dirty and infested with drugs and violence 
— conditions that have been many times 
compounded by the coronavirus outbreak. 
"It is an outrage I have to say, and I'm very 
disappointed the Attorney General has not 
followed through on making a thorough 
investigation of conditions that those of us in 
the business, as it were, are all too familiar 
with," Judge Berman said. "And more 
importantly has not implemented appropriate 
changes." 
A spokesman for the U.S. Department of 
Justice in Washington, D.C., did not 
immediately respond to a request for 
comment. 
The judge's remarks came at the sentencing 
via video and audio conference of Terrance 
Morgan, who pled guilty to bank fraud 
conspiracy in October for his role in a scheme 
to steal $2.5 million from an unnamed law 
firm's bank account. 
Morgan, a citizen of Liberia and U.S. resident, 
already served about 14 months in custody 
with the Bureau of Prisons — including at the 
MDC — Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement and local authorities. 
An attorney for Morgan, Sam Schmidt, said 
he was pleased with Judge Berman's 
EFTA00025384
--- PAGE 3 ---
decision. 
"It is gratifying to hear that Judge Berman 
fully understands what our clients are going 
through in the Bureau of Prisons at this time, 
especially in MCC and MDC," Schmidt said. 
While Judge Berman didn't explicitly tie 
Morgan's sentence of time served, three 
months of home confinement and four years 
of supervised release to the conditions at the 
MDC, and the dangers of the coronavirus to 
inmates, it appeared to be a major factor. The 
judge also said while he doesn't disagree that 
Morgan's crime was a serious one, he said 
the goals of general and specific deterrence 
have been met, and the term of incarceration 
he has already served is adequate. 
The judge also appeared to give some 
amount of weight to an April 30 report by 
Homer Venters, a physician and 
epidemiologist, who toured the 1,700-inmate 
facility recently to observe the jail's response 
to COVID-19. 
In the report, which was filed in a proposed 
class action brought by medically vulnerable 
inmates seeking release from the prison 
because of the coronavirus, Venters 
excoriated the medical care at MDC in his 
expert report. 
Venters, who previously served as the chief 
medical officer for New York City's jails, cited 
an array of problems including faulty virus 
screening, ignored and discarded sick-call 
requests, inept medical care and a "gross 
EFTA00025385
--- PAGE 4 ---
deviation" from Centers for Disease 
Controland Prevention and correctional 
health care standards. 
"I have to say it's a very serious document. It 
is not surprising to me. I've personally 
become acutely aware of the deficiencies at 
the ... MDC," Judge Berman said, citing a 
well-known incident in January 2019 when a 
fire took out the jail's power and heat. 
Inmates were left in frigid conditions for a 
week and denied meetings with their 
attorneys or any other visits. 
That incident led to an ongoing lawsuit by the 
Federal Defenders of New York against the 
BOP over attorneys' access to clients in the 
MDC. That case is currently in mediation, 
which includes the MCC as well. 
Judge Berman said Venters' report requires 
that there be a response from the BOP to the 
criticisms in the document. 
"Such a response is long overdue," Judge 
Berman said. "It was long overdue when 
Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide, long 
before then." 
The government is represented by Dina 
McLeod and Robert B. Sobelman of the U.S. 
Attorney's Office for the Southern District of 
New York. 
Morgan is represented by Sam A. Schmidt. 
The case is U.S. v. Morgan et al., case 
number 1:19-cr-00209, in the U.S. District

We're glad that information is helpful, and we appreciate you checking in with us on this — thank you. We do not believe 
that asking victims about their past contacts with the USAO-SDFL and FBI-MIA in or about 2005-2008 would present any 
issues for our office, we would just respectfully ask that any such discussions avoid addressing the substance of the 
underlying criminal scheme (including the victims' personal experiences and interactions with Epstein or his associates). 
And if those topics unavoidably arise despite not having been raised by OPR, we'd ask that you please let us know so we 
can incorporate any such witness statements as 3500 material as appropriate and required. But please let us know if that 
poses any issues on your end.

Thank you, M. This is sufficient; no need for you to do anything further. 
I want to assure you that in reaching out to and possibly interviewing the victims regarding their past contacts with the 
USAO-SDFL and FBI-MIA, OPR wishes to in no way interfere with anything your office may be doing currently or 
anticipates doing in the future. Please confirm that our doing so does not present any issues for your office. If you have 
any concerns in that regard, please let me know so we can discuss the matter. I hope I might hear back from you by 
midday Wednesday if possible.

Thanks for following up, and as discussed we are able to advise OPR regarding the individuals on your list whom we 
understand to be represented by counsel. I'm happy to speak with you via phone at your convenience, but in the first 
instance, because the overwhelming majority of the individuals on your list are represented by counsel, attached is a 
spreadsheet with the relevant information. The spreadsheet represents our best and current understanding—it is of 
course possible that individuals have changed their counsel very recently, but this should hopefully at least get you 
started. 
As reflected in the spreadsheet, of the 32 individuals you listed, 22 are represented by Brad Edwards, of Edwards Pottinger 
LLC; two are represented by Jack Scarola, of Searcy Law; one is represented by Sigrid McCawley, of Boies Schiller; one is 
represented by Rita Glavin, of Seward & Kissel LLP, and one is represented by Gloria Allred, of Allred, Maroko & Goldberg. 
Of the remaining five, four we have been unable to connect with (at least at the AUSA level), and one we believe is 
deceased. The contact information for the attorneys is the following: 
Brad Edwards 
Jack Scarola 
Sigrid McCawley 
Rita Glavin 
Gloria Allred 
Please let me know if it would be helpful to chat, and thanks as always.

Former Jeffrey Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell suffered a pair of courtroom setbacks Thursday morning, 
losing a bid to gag federal prosecutors and lawyers for witnesses in her sex trafficking case, and failing to 
convince a judge in a defamation suit to keep a trove of documents under seal.

I have a recollection that when we were interviewing employees at the MCC, one or more individuals told us there was 
a sign posted in the SHU that said to do your checks on Epstein. If memory serves, we never recovered the document.

As a baseball season like no other begins, 
escaping coronavirus proves impossible 
A reporter approached Sen. Mitt Romney in the Capitol on Wednesday 
afternoon to ask: "Do you have confidence in the president's handling of 
this crisis right now?" 
"Which? There are so many crises going on," replied Romney (R-Utah). 
"I'm not sure which."

The 2012 GOP presidential nominee was not trying to be flip and lamented 
President Trump's response to the novel coronavirus when the reporter 
clarified. But our nation faces cascading crises: the worst civil unrest since 
EFTA00025443
--- PAGE 2 ---
1968, the worst economic upheaval since 1933 and the worst public health 
emergency since 1918. This morning's jobs report shows another 1.4 
million workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, the 18th 
straight week that more than a million Americans have filed claims. 
Other ongoing crises get less attention because of the contagion, but that 
does not mean they have been solved. There is an opioid crisis causing 
deaths of despair, the climate crisis that imperils the future of the planet, a 
looming sovereign debt crisis that most political leaders seem nonchalant 
about, rising great-power conflict with China, including a new space race, 
and fresh complications overnight in Afghanistan as America struggles to 
exit her longest war.

It's time to remove hurdles to cancer care. 
Congress addressed the affordability of Covid-19 testing and treatment. Cancer care 
needs the same. It's time to reduce out-of-pocket costs and ensure cost-sharing 
assistance benefits cancer patients. 
Professional sports offer a comfortable getaway from the challenges of life 
and the burdens of reality. For a few hours, and a few bucks, you can go to 
the ballpark and escape. That has always been part of the joy that comes 
with the price of admission. 
On this Opening Day of the Major League Baseball season, delayed by 
nearly four months because of the coronavirus, such escapism is 
impossible. Largely, this is because no one is safe from covid-19. To wit, the 
Kansas City Royals revealed Wednesday that Hunter Dozier, who hit 26 
home runs last season, tested positive and will be placed on the injured list. 
EFTA00025444

This abridged 6o-game season, instead of the usual 162, will not be 
baseball as we know it; it might better be described as covidball. First off, 
there will be no spectators allowed in the stands, so all of us will be 
watching on television and fake crowd noise will be piped into the 
ballparks. 
There is supposed to be social distancing — and mask wearing — in the 
dugout. Players have been told not to give high-fives. Or spit. Or chew 
sunflower seeds. Coaches have been told they are not allowed to touch their 
faces. 
iti 
Tradition-bound Major League Baseball has made rule changes that would 
have been considered sacrilege not long ago, including introducing 
designated hitters in the National League and starting extra innings with 
an automatic runner on second base. 
Historically and culturally, baseball has been far less political and polarized 
than professional football and basketball. Players have tended to be less 
outspoken than their counterparts in other sports. (I touched on this in 
2017 after completing a personal quest to watch games at all 3o major 
league stadiums.) 
But times are changing. The sport has not been immune to the national 
reckoning on racial injustice. San Francisco Giants manager Gabe Kapler 
and several of his players knelt during the national anthem earlier this 
week before an exhibition game, provoking an attack by Trump. "Looking 
forward to live sports," he tweeted on Tuesday, "but any time I witness a 
player kneeling during the National Anthem, a sign of great disrespect for 
our Country and our Flag, the game is over for me!" 
EFTA00025445
--- PAGE 4 ---
In a show of solidarity, "Black Lives Matter" will be stenciled on several 
mounds across the league this weekend, including in Washington. The 
league has also given players the option to wear patches on their jerseys 
that use the phrase. 
The topsy-turvy process that got us to Opening Day has itself been a 
metaphor for the country's broader struggle to control the virus. Baseball is 
the first of the big four sports to play a regular season game since March. 
The United States has lagged Europe and Asia in restarting professional 
sports. Players are being tested regularly now, but there have been long 
delays in turning around results — just like for the rest of society — that 
limit the values of the tests.

So often, it has felt like America just cannot catch a break these past few 
months. It is perhaps apt that the forecast calls for scattered 
thunderstorms to linger in Washington into the evening before tapering off 
after sunset.

Tony Fauci, the government's top infectious-disease expert, will throw the 
ceremonial first pitch of the first game at 7 p.m. Eastern in Washington as 
the Nationals take on the New York Yankees. ESPN will broadcast it live. In 
a video released Wednesday by the Nationals, the 79-year-old Fauci said he 
was nervous about getting the ball past home plate. Washington star Ryan 
Zimmerman told him not to worry. "If you bounce it, there's nobody there 
to boo you," he quipped.

I will never forget flying to Houston last October to watch the Nationals 
win in the World Series with my dad. But it feels hard to believe that 
incredible playoff run was just nine months ago. It feels like nine years. 
The season opener is a doubleheader: The Dodgers will play the Giants 
tonight in Los Angeles after the Nationals-Yankees game. But San 
Francisco's star catcher Buster Posey will not play. He has opted to sit out 
the season because he and his wife adopted identical twin girls who were 
born prematurely, and he doesn't want to put them at risk. Among the 
dozen or so other stars skipping this season are Zimmerman, Atlanta's 
Nick Markakis, Los Angeles's David Price and Colorado's Ian Desmond. 
The members of my fantasy baseball league normally gather in the 
basement of a Capitol Hill bar for an annual draft. This year, we gathered 
virtually to respect social distancing protocols. We also waited to hold our 
draft until late last night because so many players kept announcing that 
they wouldn't play this season. None of us wanted to pay for pitchers and 
hitters who will not generate any stats for our teams. 
(For those who care about the game, the roster for "The 2O2s" includes 
Gerrit Cole, Francisco Lindor, Clayton Kershaw, Nelson Cruz, Javier Baez, 
Jose Altuve, Matt Olson, Eddie Rosario and Kyle Schwarber. Picking Cole 
as one of my staffing pitchers creates a somewhat awkward dynamic 
tonight because I will be cheering for the Nationals as the new Yankees ace 
starts against them. So it goes.) 
Everything comes with some risks amid the pandemic. The first road game 
for the Nationals will be against the Toronto Blue Jays. But no one knows 
where that game will take place because Canada is not allowing its sole 
MLB team to play in the country. On Wednesday, the state of Pennsylvania 
told the Blue Jays that they will not be allowed to play their home games 
this season at PNC Park in Pittsburgh, as they had hoped to do.

Anecdotal evidence is mounting that you can get covid-19 
twice, but doctors remain unsure. 
EFTA00025448
--- PAGE 7 ---
"When Sophie Cunningham, a guard for the WNBA's Phoenix Mercury, 
returned to training last week after a bout with covid-19, she ... said she 
believed she had been infected twice — once in March and then again in 
June or July," Carolyn Johnson and Ariana Eunjung Cha report. "Daniel 
Griffin, an infectious diseases doctor and researcher at Columbia 
University Medical Center, said that with every virus — including 
chickenpox, for which antibodies are supposed to last a lifetime — there are 
cases of people who become sick again after recovering from the initial 
illness. When it comes to Ebola, American doctor Ian Crozier was declared 
free of the virus but then doctors found it lurking in his eye. In HIV/AIDS, 
a baby in Mississippi born to an HIV-positive mother was thought to be 
cured but then the virus reemerged 27 months after therapy was stopped. 
So in a world where 14.5 million people have had the coronavirus, a small 
number with resurgent sickness should not be cause for alarm.... 
"At the University of Pennsylvania, there was the pregnant woman infected 
in March who was fine for two months and then became so sick during 
childbirth she had to be put on a ventilator. At Cleveland Clinic, there was a 
patient with very mild symptoms in February — just a loss of smell and 
taste — who was well for two months, but then needed to be hospitalized in 
early May and was confirmed to have the virus again. And at ProHealth 
Care in Long Island, there was a man infected at the end of March who was 
never sick enough to be hospitalized. He showed up again in July, this time 
very ill. 'He thought he had an immunity shield, so he took care of his son 
when he got covid,' Griffin said. Two weeks later, he was in the ER' The 
man, who had a very high antibody response the first time and donated his 
plasma so it could be used to treat other coronavirus patients, had barely 
any when doctors recently tested his blood in the hospital." 
There are conflicting explanations for what's going on. "For severe acute 
respiratory syndrome, or SARS, and Middle East respiratory syndrome 
(MERS), the antibodies seem to last for a year or longer. But other 
coronaviruses, such as the four that cause the common cold, act differently. 
EFTA00025449
--- PAGE 8 ---
People seem to be able to get them each season, over and over again," 
Carolyn and Ariana report. "Last week, a British study posted to a preprint 
server added to the body of evidence that virus-fighting antibodies drop off 
steeply two to three months after infection ... It was quickly followed by 
another study, also not peer-reviewed, of antibodies in nearly 20,000 New 
Yorkers with mild or moderate covid-19 symptoms. After retesting 120 of 
those people three months later, researchers at Mount Sinai Health System 
found virus-fighting antibodies were largely stable and had even increased 
in people that started with lower levels right after their infections." 
The Senate GOP scrapped Trump's demand for a payroll 
tax cut. 
Senate Republicans have cast aside one of Trump's key demands in their 
emerging coronavirus stimulus package, refusing to include a payroll tax 
cut in their opening offer to Democrats, which Senate Majority Leader 
Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is aiming to announce later today. "The 
development came amid a frantic GOP effort to try and salvage other parts 
of the package, though the entire process remained fluid and there was 
confusion among Republican aides about when a deal might be reached," 
per Erica Werner, Seung Min Kim and Jeff Stein.

evidence that hiring for white-collar jobs has stalled and did not bode 
well for a short-term recovery," Jena McGregor reports.

are worth more than $100 million. They're contingent on the vaccine 
making it to a Phase 2 trial, which is said to be imminent. (Hamza 
Shaban) 
The U.S. will soon surpass 4 million confirmed cases. 
"Trump painted a wishful view Wednesday of the U.S. response to the 
coronavirus pandemic, in which existing treatments can almost cure 
patients flooding hospitals, all schools will safely reopen this fall, and the 
country's soaring cases are confined to a handful of states," William Wan 
and Jacqueline Dupree report. "The rosy assessment he issued at a White 
House news briefing ... was undermined by the alarming reality that on 
Wednesday, almost every metric showed just how badly America is losing 
its fight against the virus. The number of daily deaths on 
Wednesday surpassed 1,10o, the first time that mark had been reached 
since May 29. And total deaths in the United States since the start of the 
pandemic increased to more than 140,000. California on Wednesday 
passed New York in the number of total confirmed coronavirus cases ... 
"With transmission rapidly spiking in many areas, governors in 
Indiana, Minnesota and Ohio joined the growing number of 
states mandating face coverings statewide. More than 3o states 
require people to wear masks. ... [Trump] declined to press for a 
nationwide mandate for masks, despite the near-universal urgings of 
public health experts.... On Wednesday, an influential model created by 
the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation ... said wider mask-wearing 
by Americans had caused the institute to revise projections on how many 
people will die of covid-19 by Nov. 1. Earlier, it had forecast 224,50o deaths 
by that date. Now, it estimates 219,90o deaths by Nov. 1 — a decrease of 
about 5,000 deaths. If 95 percent of Americans wore masks when leaving 
their homes, that number would drop further to 185,900, IHME 
researchers said."

A Texas county is storing bodies in trucks because so 
many residents are dying. 
"Texas, which reported 197 deaths and 10,893 hospitalizations, has been 
one of the states hardest hit by the resurgent coronavirus. Hidalgo County, 
at the southern tip of the state on the U.S. border with Mexico, has seen 
cases rise 6o percent in the last week ... with deaths doubling to more than 
36o," Reuters reports. "Crematoriums in the Hidalgo area have a wait list 
of two weeks ... forcing the county to use five refrigerated trucks that can 
hold 50 bodies each. Hidalgo's top medical official, Dr. Ivan Melendez, 
partly blamed (Republican Gov. Greg) Abbott's move to override local 
officials for the spike in coronavirus infections, which he said has jammed 
the local medical system at every level." 
Banks face a unique coronavirus problem: Robbers in 
masks. 
Financial regulators and banks fear masks could double as handy disguises 
for would-be bank robbers, and there have been a few mask-involved 
attempted robberies. "In one case, a man walked into a Houston bank with 
a bandanna covering his face and handed a teller a note: 'I didn't get a 
stimulus or that iok loan. I lost my business to Covid so please make this 
easy and comply,' Renae Merle reports. "Another would-be robber in 
Florida, entered a Wells Fargo branch wearing sunglasses, gloves and a 
white cone-like mask over his face. He approached a teller's window 
demanding money, according to the arrest warrant. But the bank employee 
had trouble hearing the robber's demands — through the mask. 'The male 
got upset and repeated himself several times' and eventually left empty-
handed, according to the arrest warrant.... Despite the robbery attempt, 
Wells Fargo began requiring customers to wear masks July 13. They are 
also required by Bank of America. JPMorgan Chase said its employees are 
required to wear masks but they would comply with local ordinances when 
it comes to their customers."

D.C. imposed one of the most stringent mask requirements 
in the country. 
"Mayor Muriel E. Bowser said her order requires people older than 2 to 
wear a mask when they leave the house and are likely to come into contact 
with others. It's one of the strictest mask ordinances in the country — and 
came on the same day the city recorded 102 new coronavirus cases, the 
highest daily number since early June," Julie Zauzmer, Ovetta Wiggins, 
Dana Hedgpeth and Rachel Chason report. "John Falcicchio, the mayor's 
chief of staff, said D.C. police will be empowered to fine people not wearing 
a mask, although the city expects such fines to be limited. As the city's case 
counts rise, Health Director LaQuandra Nesbitt said Wednesday that an 
increasing proportion of those newly diagnosed infections involve younger 
people." 
• The virus could push 250,000 into hunger in the D.C. region,

Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler got tear-gassed by federal 
agents. 
EFTA00025454

"Wheeler choked on tear gas late Wednesday as he stood outside the 
federal courthouse in downtown Portland, where federal agents set off 
explosives and fired chemicals into a crowd of hundreds," Marissa Lang 
reports. "The Democratic mayor ... had strapped on lab goggles to help 
protect his eyes, but still, the mayor said, his face burned and eyes watered. 
`It's hard to breathe — it's a little harder to breathe than I thought,' 
Wheeler told The Washington Post while a man with a leaf blower turned 
the nozzle on the mayor to clear away any gas still hanging in the air. 'This 
is abhorrent. This is beneath us.' As Wheeler stood at the fence, he was 
heckled and insulted. ... For hours before Wheeler's brush with chemical 
irritants, the mayor made a contentious and, at times, tense attempt to talk 
with protesters. On the wall of the justice center behind him, activists had 
displayed a list of demands. The last demand on the list, which included 
defunding the Portland Police Bureau by 5o percent and expelling federal 
forces from the city, was for Wheeler to resign. ... After nearly an hour, 
Wheeler had enough. A thick cloud of gas hung over the place where he 
stood as he and two security officers pushed through the crowd and away 
from the federal building." 
The House voted to remove Confederate statues from the 
Capitol. 
The chamber also voted to "replace the bust of Roger B. Taney, the U.S. 
chief justice who wrote the Supreme Court decision that said people of 
African descent are not U.S. citizens," Felicia Sonmez and Donna Cassata 
report. "The vote was 305 to 113 for the bill that would replace the bust of 
Taney, which sits outside the old Supreme Court chamber on the first floor 
of the Capitol, with one of Thurgood Marshall, the first black member of 
the Supreme Court. ... Democrats were unified in backing the measure; all 
the no votes came from Republicans, who were divided with 72 GOP 
lawmakers voting for the bill and 113 opposed." 
• The GOP-controlled Senate is poised to defy Trump's veto threat and

generals. The name changes are included in the $740 billion military 
spending bill, a final version of which the Senate has yet to pass. But 
the chamber voted yesterday to end the debate period for 
amendments without taking up a measure from Sen. Josh Hawley (R-
Mo.) that sought to strip the legislation's requirement to rename the 
bases. (Karoun Demirjian) 
• George Washington University will consider retiring the school's 
"Colonials" moniker and renaming the campus's community center.

president credited with expanding the school but also known for being 
a segregationist who resisted admitting black students. (Lauren 
Lumpkin) 
Trump announced a surge of federal law enforcement into 
Chicago and Albuquerque. 
"Appearing at an event with top federal law enforcement officials and the 
family members of crime victims, Trump delivered fiery talking points that 
took direct aim at those who have advocated redirecting funding from law 
enforcement to other endeavors. He blamed the recent increases in 
violence in some cities on leaders who have endorsed such steps and said 
he planned to increase federal law enforcement's presence to reduce 
crime," Matt Zapotosky reports. "Soon after he finished speaking, 
Chicago's mayor accused Trump of seeking to distract from his handling of 
the coronavirus pandemic.... The deployments, at least at first, will be 
focused in Chicago and Albuquerque, where Attorney General William P. 
Barr said the Justice Department will roll out a program it launched earlier 
this month in Kansas City, Mo., to increase the number of agents from the 
FBI, the U.S. Marshals Service, the Drug Enforcement Administration and 
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The program 
was named `Operation Legend' to honor 4-year-old LeGend Taliferro, who 
was shot and killed in Kansas City last month." 
• Barr falsely claimed that federal agents have already arrested 200 
people in K.C. as part of "Operation Legend." A Justice Department

last year and included state and FBI arrests in other joint operations.

• Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner (D) said he's prepared to 
arrest federal agents if they bring the tactics they've used in Portland 
to his city. "Anyone, including federal law enforcement, who 
unlawfully assaults and kidnaps people will face criminal charges 
from my office," he said. (Bloomberg News) 
• The number of people trying to buy guns who are not legally allowed 
to own them has more than doubled this spring, according to internal 
FBI data. A year ago, in March, the FBI's National Instant Criminal 
Background Check System ran background checks on 823,273 
attempted gun buys, blocking about 9,500 people from buying guns. 
This March, the system processed more than 1.4 million background 
checks and blocked 23,692 gun sales. (Politico)

• A Canadian court said sending asylum seekers back to the U.S. 
violates their rights. The court "threw out a long-standing deal that

The elections 
EFTA00025457
--- PAGE 16 ---
At least 76 percent of American voters can cast ballots by 
mail this fall. 
"As of now, nearly i8o million Americans who are eligible to vote would be 
able to cast a ballot by mail. Of those, 22 million live in states that will 
accept fear of the coronavirus as an excuse to vote absentee, or have 
switched to become 'no excuse' states," Kate Rabinowitz and Brittany 
Renee Mayes report. "Thirty-four states and the District of Columbia 
already allowed anyone to vote absentee. But many of these places are 
making the process easier. California will start proactively mailing ballots 
to registered voters, joining universal vote-by-mail states such as Colorado. 
Many states will send every registered voter an absentee-ballot application. 
These types of statewide expansions affect another 63 million eligible 
voters. In some states like Nebraska, individual counties are planning to 
send mail-in voting applications in the absence of a statewide directive. For 
voters in nine states — Connecticut, New York, Indiana, Kentucky, 
Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Texas and West Virginia — in-
person voting remains the only option unless they can provide an approved 
reason not related to fear of the coronavirus. Traditional absentee excuses 
include military deployments or illness." 
Republican lawmakers are privately having conversations 
about what happens if Trump refuses to relinquish power. 
"Most legal experts said it is hard to envision that Trump would actually try 
to remain in office after a clear defeat by Biden, considering the uproar that 
would follow," Elise Viebeck and Robert Costa report. "But his 
unwillingness to commit to a smooth transition of power has forced 
academics and political leaders — including, privately, some GOP 
lawmakers — to contemplate possible scenarios.... Among the possibilities: 
Trump could claim victory before the vote in key states is fully counted — a 
process that could take days or even weeks this year because of the 
expected avalanche of absentee ballots. He could also spend weeks refusing 
to concede amid a legal war over which votes are valid and should be 
EFTA00025458
--- PAGE 17 ---
included in the tally ... Or he could simply refuse to leave on Jan. 2O. ... 
This year, the president has attacked the security of voting by mail at least 
5o times ... There is no evidence that mail voting leads to the kind of 
massive fraud Trump has described.... 
"In GOP circles, private talk about Trump's assertions veers 
from alarm to shrugging off his comments as simply incendiary 
political salvos. One moderate Republican House member, who spoke 
on the condition of anonymity to comment candidly and avoid Trump's 
wrath, said he expects Trump to `leave quickly' if it is a blowout defeat. But 
he said he worries about a narrow election and whether Trump would go to 
extreme lengths to `protect his personal brand."It's something we'd all 
rather not think about, but it's there,' he said. The president is being 
backed by a bustling Republican operation in 15 states to monitor voting 
locations and ensure a heavy GOP presence at polling sites. Trump's 
reelection campaign and the RNC are working together to 
recruit 50,000 volunteers to serve as `poll watchers,' according to 
advisers to both groups, with $2o million set aside for courtroom fights ... 
Democrats and voting rights advocates, meanwhile, are mustering their 
own legal effort to make it easier to cast ballots by mail, filing more than 5o 
lawsuits in 25 states." 
• A new Quinnipiac University poll finds Biden leading Trump by one 
point in Texas, 45 percent to 44 percent. Voters there say they like 
Trump better, but they're seriously considering breaking for the 
former vice president. (Aaron Blake) 
• Biden claimed that Trump is America's "first" racist president. That's 
not correct: A dozen presidents owned slaves. Others like Woodrow 
Wilson used racist language. And many others, think Andrew 
Jackson, enacted racist policies. Trump's spokeswoman also insists 
that he is not racist. (Colby Itkowitz and John Wagner) 
Trump keeps bragging about passing a cognitive test, but it 
doesn't mean what he thinks it does. 
EFTA00025459
--- PAGE 18 ---
"In another Fox News interview [last night], Trump couldn't resist 
revisiting what he said was the hardest part of the test — repeating five 
words, in order. Trump said he was first asked to repeat a set of words — 
'person,"woman,"man,"camera,"TV,' he said, offering a hypothetical 
example — and then, later in the assessment after some time had elapsed, 
he was again asked whether he remembered those same words, in order," 
Ashley Parker and William Wan report. "'And they say... 'Go back to that 
question, and repeat them. Can you do it?" Trump said, mimicking the 
doctors administering the exam. `And you go, `Person, woman, man, 
camera, TV.' They say, 'That's amazing. How did you do that?' I do it 
because I have, like, a good memory, because I'm cognitively there.' ... 
Experts say the president's fixation on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment 
... is particularly puzzling because the test is normally administered 
only if someone is concerned that they or their loved ones may 
be experiencing dementia or other cognitive decline. Getting a perfect 
score — as Trump has repeatedly claimed he did — merely signifies that the 
test-taker probably does not have a cognitive impairment as measured by 
the exam." 
Senate primaries are exposing growing fissures inside the 
GOP. 
The Senate Leadership Fund formally took a side Wednesday in a 
contested GOP primary for a candidate to succeed retiring Kansas Sen. Pat 
Roberts (R). The super PAC's aim is to stifle the chances of former Kansas 
secretary of state Kris Kobach. Kobach choked in a very winnable 
governor's race two years ago. SLF, which is closely aligned with 
McConnell and run by his former chief of staff, will launch a $1.2 million 
ad campaign promoting Rep. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) in the primary. The 
primary in Tennessee to replace retiring Sen. Lamar Alexander is also 
becoming nastier: The Trump-endorsed candidate, former U.S. 
ambassador to Japan Bill Hagerty, launched attack ads this week against

endorsed. (Seung Min Kim and Rachael Bade) 
Trump's company applied to trademark the word "telerally." 
Then Trump held one. 
In an application to the trademark office, a subsidiary of the organization 
said the word will be used for "organizing events in the field of politics and 
political campaigning." The trademark application could mark a shift in the 
company's business model, which has always stayed one step away from 
politics and doesn't market itself as a political company. By filing it, 
trademark experts said, the company is saying it intends to enter this 
business soon. (David Fahrenthold and Colby Itkowitz) 
Following weeks of erratic behavior by Kanye West, his 
wife addressed his bipolar disorder. 
Kim Kardashian West issued a statement requesting "compassion and 
empathy" from the public, as the rapper claims that he's running for 
president. "We as a society talk about giving grace to the issue of mental 
health as a whole," the reality TV star wrote, "however we should also give 
it to the individuals who are living with it in times when they need it most." 
West held what was billed as a campaign rally in North Charleston, S.C., on 
Sunday, during which he attacked abolitionist Harriet Tubman and 
revealed that he and Kardashian had seriously considered terminating 
their first pregnancy. "For the following two nights, West sent — and, in 
most cases, deleted — tweets detailing a strained relationship with his 
family," Sonia Rao reports. "He also stated that Kardashian tried to get him 
medical attention and, later on, claimed he has been trying to divorce her."

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 49 Filed 08/25/20 Page 1 of 4 
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
United States of America, 
—v—
Ghislaine Maxwell, 
Defendant. 
USDC SDNY 
DOCUMENT 
ELECTRONICALLY FILED 
DOC 0: 
DATE FILED: 8/25/20 
20-CR-330 (MN) 
MEMORANDUM 
OPINION AND ORDER 
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
On August 10, 2020, the Defendant filed a letter motion related to two issues. Dkt. No. 
38. First, the Defendant seeks an order directing the Government to disclose to defense counsel 
immediately the identities of the three alleged victims referenced in the indictment. Second, the 
Defendant seeks an order directing the Bureau of Prisons ("BOP") to release the Defendant into 
the general population and to provide her with increased access to the discovery materials. For 
the reasons that follow, Defendant's requests are DENIED without prejudice. 
I. 
The Disclosure of Alleged Victims' Identities 
The Defendant first seeks an order directing the Government to disclose to defense 
counsel immediately the identities of the three alleged victims referenced in the indictment. Dkt. 
No. 38 at I. Her request is premature. Production of discovery, which may itself identify 
alleged victims and relevant witnesses to the defense, has just begun. Moreover, the parties have 
not yet engaged in discussions regarding an appropriate schedule for pretrial disclosures, 
including witness lists and § 3500 material. The Court is mindful of the factors pointed to by the 
Defendant—in particular the fact that charges in this matter relate to conduct that allegedly took 
place many years ago—and anticipates that such a schedule would require the disclosure of 
EFTA00025464
--- PAGE 2 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 49 Filed 08/25/20 Page 2 of 4 
alleged victims and witnesses substantially in advance of trial. But that alone does not justify 
such relief at this very early stage. Following the close of discovery, the parties should meet and 
confer on an appropriate schedule in light of all relevant factors. If the parties are unable to 
reach agreement as to a pretrial disclosure schedule, the Defendant may renew her request. The 
denial is therefore without prejudice. 
II. 
The Defendant's Conditions of Confinement 
In her August 10, 2020 letter motion, the Defendant also sought "an order directing 
[BOP] to release Ms. Maxwell into the general population and provide Ms. Maxwell with 
increased access to the discovery materials while she is detained so that she can meaningfully 
participate in the preparation of her defense." Dkt. No. 38 at 1. The Government responded that 
the BOP has modified the conditions of Ms. Maxwell's confinement so that she has access to 
discovery materials thirteen hours a day, seven days a week. Dkt. No. 41 at 5. The Defendant's 
reply credited the GOP's change in policy but nonetheless asked the Court to "confirm these 
changes in an order to the BOP" and "that the Court order the BOP to grant Ms. Maxwell the 
same privileges given to other detainees." Dkt. No. 42 at 4-5. 
The Court denies this request. The BOP is providing the Defendant with conditions that 
allow her access to discovery materials so that she can meaningfully participate in the 
preparation of her defense. Further action by the Court as this juncture is therefore unnecessary. 
Should facts on the ground change such that the Defendant is not being provided sufficient 
access to her legal materials, defense counsel may seek intervention by the Court. 
The Defendant also requests that the Court order BOP that Ms. Maxwell "be monitored 
in the same manner as other pretrial detainees and that the Court order the BOP to grant Ms. 
EFTA00025465
--- PAGE 3 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 49 Filed 08/25/20 Page 3 of 4 
Maxwell the same privileges given to other detainees." Dkt. No. 42 at 5. In a footnote, the 
defense clarifies that "[a]s long as Ms. Maxwell is monitored in the same manner, and receives 
the same privileges as other pretrial detainees, it is not necessary to move her to the general 
population." Dkt. No. 42 at 5 n.4. 
The Court sees no basis for granting the Defendant's request for an order directed to 
BOP. First, the Government has assured the Court that "[a]s with all inmates, the defendant is 
able to speak to her counsel behind a closed door, in an area that is visible—but not audible—to 
MDC staff," thereby ensuring that Ms. Maxwell's ability to communicate with her counsel is in 
no way interfered. Dkt. No. 41 at 4 n.5. And as to the more general implementation of 
surveillance procedures, the Court credits GOP's duty to ensure the safety and security of the 
Defendant as justifying the measures BOP has adopted. See Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 547 
(1979) ("Prison administrators ... should be accorded wide-ranging deference in the adoption 
and execution of policies and practices that in their judgment are needed to preserve internal 
order and discipline and to maintain institutional security."). Nor does the Defendant provide 
any basis for the Court to conclude that the level of surveillance is punitive. Dkt. No. 42 at 5. 
Though pretrial detainees "may not be punished prior to an adjudication of guilt in accordance 
with due process of law," Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 535, it does not follow that surveillance measures 
are punitive just because the Defendant deems them "onerous." Dkt. No. 42 at 4. The 
Defendant has provided the Court with no evidence, and no reason to believe, that the 
surveillance measures are motivated by improper purposes. 
As a result, Defendant's request is denied. To ensure that Ms. Maxwell is able to 
continue to adequately participate in her defense, however, the Court hereby ORDERS the 
Government to provide written status updates every 90 days detailing any material changes to the 
EFTA00025466
--- PAGE 4 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 49 Filed 08/25/20 Page 4 of 4 
conditions of Ms. Maxwell's confinement, with particular emphasis on her access to legal 
materials and ability to communicate with defense counsel. 
III. 
Conclusion 
For the reasons stated above, Defendant's requests contained in Dkt. No. 38 are DENIED 
without prejudice. Following the close of discovery, the parties shall meet and confer on an 
appropriate schedule for pre-trial disclosures, including the disclosure of § 3500 material, exhibit 
lists, and witness lists, taking into account all relevant factors. The Government is hereby 
ORDERED to submit written status updates every 90 days detailing any material changes to the 
conditions of Ms. Maxwell's confinement, with particular emphasis on her access to legal 
materials and ability to communicate with defense counsel. 
SO ORDERED.

Just to be clear. The US Attorney's Office (or it's contractors) are not "processing" anything. You are taking files 
that I will be extracting from processed evidence and putting them into an E-Discovery tool (Relativity) to do a 
taint review. 
Relativity is NOT a forensic tool. It is incapable of dealing with many things that are found forensically on a 
computer like free space, slack space, and system files to name a few. When we started this, and you insisted 
you do the taint review in Relativity, I warned you that it was adding months worth of work on top of what 
was already done, and that Relativity was incapable of viewing everything. You insisted we do it this way. So 
now 
and I have come up with a way to fit this round peg into this square hole. We will get it done. 
Sorry it has taken so long, but we are talking about terabytes worth of data over multiple forms of digital 
evidence. Phones, tablets, loose media, cameras, DVRs, servers, laptops, and desktop computers. We have 
gotten past encryption on multiple devices. When we review devices on such large cases, we usually do it 
piece by piece as things are processed, I was unaware that you didn't want to review as things were 
processed, that you wanted to do it "all at once", so that added to the delay. Sorry for that. Just a 
differentiation of methodology I suppose. 
and I feel confident that the method we have come up with will be more consistent and preserve the 
attribution of files to devices and links of e-mails to attachments that the load file generation that I did a while 
back was lacking.

Okay, so just to check, you both think that there is not a need to do a test run? You're both comfortable with just 
basically sending us copies of everything? I don't totally understand why we couldn't have done that eight months ago, 
but regardless of the passage of time, I want to make sure we understand so we can report to our supervisors. I assume 
that means that we (at the U.S. Attorney's Office and through contractors) will therefore need to do all the processing 
ourselves, correct? And thanks again to you both.

make sure it transfers correctly, before sending over literally everything — is that still the plan?

waiting on that list to be able to do an updated search warrant on all of those devices. Please let us know the current

Following up on this from a month ago — I know we're living in a different world than what existed four weeks ago, but 
are you at all able to assist while working remotely? This has been pending for almost two months and we still don't 
have a very basic list of each device or item that was seized and searched, or for which of those we've received 
materials. We're happy to have a call if that would be useful, but as a first step the most basic thing we're looking for is 
the info in the template spreadsheet we sent earlier (that's also attached).

Unfortunately I don't think this is very helpful to us. Did you take a look at the example spreadsheet I sent on 2/24? The 
excel file you sent has descriptions that don't match up to the items listed in the search warrant returns (that we sent on 
2/23), and we don't have the 1B or CART numbers to be able to cross-reference. We also can't tell what you mean by 
"loose media" without a specific comparison to what was seized, we don't know which items you're referring to as 
"Windows machines," and we can't tell whether the entirety of any particular item has been transferred, or just partial. 
For example, it looks like we have gotten very, very few image files, which is surprising. 
We have also encountered some very significant problems in trying to review the more than 1 million documents we 
recently received: 
The data we've received has no way to put any emails and attachments together. So if an email says, "see the 
attached flight records," for example, we have no way of linking that up with the records themselves. Not only is 
that a big problem for us in review, it's going to be a huge problem for producing the documents to defense 
counsel. 
The load file has no link to the native file, so when we load the data to the database, there's no way to have the 
native files show up in the database. Because many of the files are too large to open in the viewer, it effectively 
means that there are many files that are completely invisible to us. 
- 
Related, the control numbers in the load file don't match up to the native files. So we have two sets of 
numbers and no way to match up anything—that is, even if we were to try to go hunt down every individual 
large file in the native files, it would be impossible. 
So the data that we most recently got, we need to get in a form that addresses those issues, and we likely will need to 
get a similar reproduction of the data we received a couple months ago. Otherwise we're sifting through more than a 
million documents without much rhyme or reason. 
I've re-attached the spreadsheet we sent last week — I think that's a good place to start in terms of our necessary record-
keeping, and we need that info at the very least, as well as anything else you think would be useful. Also attaching the 
SW returns for reference. And again, we're happy to meet up anytime and hash all this out in person if that's useful.

Here is a listing of what I have already handed over in load files to the US Attorney's Office for taint review. Some points 
of clarification: There were 9 IDE hard drives found in the Manhattan apartment, they turned out to be 3 copies of 3 
drives (9 drives in total) from a July 2007 search on one of his properties. I only processed 3 (as they were all copies). All 
the loose media from the NY apartment is included. All the Windows machines from the NY apartment are included. 
Only 2 Macs from NY and 1 from the Island are included. 
I will have to more closely coordinate with whoever is loading up Relativity with the remaining Macs as the tool 
they have to be processed with does not easily re-name the load files.

Totally understand about the network issues—we can relate. I do still think it will be helpful to all sit down together to 
have an in-person discussion, to make sure everybody is on the same page. Are folks available for that next week? And 
what I think would be most helpful to facilitate that would be a spreadsheet of each separate device referenced in the 
two search warrant returns, with columns for whether we've dumped the contents, whether they've been reviewed 
and/or transferred, what portions were transferred, etc. 
Something roughly like the attached, with any other categories you think would be useful — and the info on the attached 
is mostly hypothetical, obviously, just as examples. That will help us fully understand what's been reviewed, transferred,

FBI was going to do an initial screen to make sure no CP, and since I think the answer was no, we'll need to get those to 
be able to review them as well.)

Sony for the delayed response. They are tearing out our old network and giving us a new one, they mandated 
we delete old stuff (about 400 TB worth). Now that they are working on replacing the network, we can do only 
local work. I should be able to give you an accounting of what is what. I can say, off the top of my head, that all 
windows based items from the NY search have been handed over as well as all loose media. The CDs from NY 
only contained pictures, no documents. There are still some Apple items from NY that need to be produced. As 
far as the Island stuff goes, the 1st item on your spreadsheet, the "kitchen" mac has been produced. Still 
working on the rest.

Team, 
Following up on the below from last weekend, I'm still not sure how we're addressing this so I thought it would make 
sense for us to all schedule a (hopefully relatively brief) meeting to all get on the same page? We didn't hear back on 
which files had previously been provided, but our tech folks did their best to differentiate, and we got access to the 
materials yesterday and its well over a million documents, and we don't have any idea what we're looking at — i.e., 
which devices the materials came from, whether it's full or partial results, how many more devices we have coming, etc. 
Based on the attached search warrant returns, it looks like from the New York mansion (the PDF) there are 
approximately 40 devices that would have storage (computers, hard drives, thumb drives, etc.) and that's not even 
counting at least 60+ CDs. And then from the Virgin Islands (the Excel spreadsheet), at least more than 25 devices, 
including multiple servers / server racks. 
So we gotta know what we've already received, what remains, anticipated schedule, etc, and I know it's a lot of moving 
pieces on all sides so wanted to loop in everybody at once. The case team will be in California this coming week from 
Tuesday through Friday, but then I think generally around the first week of March, which will hopefully be plenty of time 
to schedule a productive meeting. 
thanks all,

I'm not sure who's the exact right person to ask this, so wanted to get everybody on one email chain about it — I have 
the hard drive that 
dropped off that has new Epstein search warrant materials, but it looks like there are also old 
materials (that I think we had previously received and uploaded??) on the hard drive, and so I'm not sure what's new. 
Just generally, and 
and I talked about this last week too, but it's basically impossible for us to keep track of what 
we're getting, and what has been completed, without some kind of identification or labeling system, along with a list of 
which devices have been extracted and downloaded. 
So for example on the hard drive currently, there are 38 folders labeled "loadFiles" through "37loadFiles" with a 
modified date of 11/14/19, which I think we may have already previously received — but I'm not sure, because we 
haven't gotten any info on which folders match up to which devices, etc. And then there's another folder titled 
"NYCO24362" that has a modified date of 1/27/20, so I think that may be the materials we hadn't previously received? 
That folder by itself has more than 600,000 items. 
EFTA00025490
--- PAGE 10 ---
I don't want to give 
anything that we've already previously received and uploaded, and I can't tell from the folder 
or file names whether everything on the drive is new, or whether just additional materials were saved onto it in addition 
to what we already have. =, 
are you able to give us some guidance on this? Ultimately what we really need is a 
spreadsheet of every device, whether it's been dumped (or partially dumped), and then identifying that same info —
which device, and what materials from it — are being given to us with each data transfer. Otherwise I think 
organizationally and for review purposes it will be a total disaster for us. 
We're happy to have a meeting on this if that's helpful — and thanks everybody for the assistance.

I unfortunately was on trial during the previous interview, but I think somewhat less time than how long it went last time. 
Ordinarily we try not to go longer than about 90 minutes in any event, so I think if she is able to block out that amount of

Hi Sigrid, 
We wanted to follow up in connection with 
— our supervisors have asked us to do an additional interview with her, 
both to follow up on some specific aspects of her recollection but also do basically go through her experiences again. As 
I'm sure you know, we have no doubts whatsoever, at all, about her candor and truthfulness in our previous interview, 
which also was broadly consistent with what she has said in other interviews, but we are nevertheless hoping she might 
be willing to speak with us sometime in the next week or two? Obviously due to the current situation we would plan to 
do it via phone, and we would be happy to chat about logistics with you if that would be helpful, or to answer any 
questions at all. And if 
is willing to speak with us again, we're happy to work around her schedule, including talking 
during an evening or weekend if that's easier for her than during the day—whatever you and she would prefer. 
Please let us know if any questions, or if it would be useful to chat, and thanks very much.

Hi Sigrid, 
Hope you had a wonderful holida season and very happy New Year. We wanted to follow up on a request we 
made after interviewing 
a few months ago. During her interview, 
referred to several 
entries in her journal that had helped refresh her recollection of the events involving Epstein and Maxwell. As 
we mentioned at the end of the interview, it would be very helpful to our investigation if we could review 
those journal entries, as well as any other records or documents 
may have that relate to her experiences 
with Epstein and Maxwell. 
Would 
be willing to share with us any relevant journal entries (or any other relevant documents she may 
have) to assist in our investigation? 
Happy to have a call to discuss if that would be helpful. 
Thank you,

Hi=, 
Another relatively quiet week for the PCU. 
NYCHA. On Monday we have the NYCHA meeting with the Brass. The team circulated the relevant materials by 
email earlier this week. 
Robert Adams Arrest. At some point next week we expect to arrest Robert Adams, a guard at MCC who we 
indicted yesterday with bribery in connection with an incident last year when he caught a woman smuggling in 
contraband, and told her she wouldn't get in trouble if she went to a motel and had sex with him, which she did. 
The FBI is working on the details and exact timing of the arrest; we are exploring whether an arrest at MCC or a 
voluntary surrender would be appropriate. (If the name sounds familiar, Adams was working in the SAMS unit the 
night of Epstein's suicide, and we interviewed him and got him appointed counsel in connection with that 
investigation; this charge spun out of that). We plan to do a press release. 
Have a nice weekend!

So there does appear to be a Marius Fortelni, originally from Austria, currently living in Southampton, NY — see: 
http://forteproperties.us/about us.htm 
http://www.mariusfortelni.com/ 
Notably—given the "residence" entry on the passport—according to Mr. Fortelni's website he resided for a time in Saudi 
Arabia. If it's possible, could we determine Marius Fortelni's birthday, and see if it matches up with the 
date 
on the passport? And then try to contact him and ask if he has any reason to know why a passport from his native 
country with his name on it would have Jeffrey Epstein's photograph on it and be in a safe in Epstein's mansion?? Given 
the time pressure I think it's totally fine to call him if you want, but completely defer to y'all. 
Thank you!!

Hi, 
We're working on a story in which we speak to several former federal prosecutors and US Attorneys about the potential 
next steps in the Epstein investigation, particularly as it pertains to Prince Andrew's unwillingness to cooperate. 
One of the things that has come up from multiple people is how unusual it is for Geoffrey Berman to have spoken 
publicly about this matter, not once, but twice. 
Per one former US Attorney: "It's an unusual move because generally speaking, there is a rule, there's guidance in the 
U.S. attorney's manual that comes from the attorney general that indicates that they are not to comment." 
Full disclosure, in most, if not all cases, the people I spoke with said they would likely have done the same thing. 
That said, would you or US Atty Berman like to provide any statement or comment to be induded in the story? 
We are on deadline for 4 p.m. Monday. Thank you in advance, I hope to hear from you before then.

Hi M, 
Just checking in—BOP currently has a deadline of June 25 to produce documents without any redactions based on Noel in 
the Epstein FOIA. Is everything on track in Noel for that date to still work? As in, all interviews or any other processes that 
could support 7(A) withholdings will be wrapped up by June 25, right?

I hope you're well! I'm helping out with the responsiveness review for WBTW and I've been looking through Steve 
Bannon's iPhone 7 on Cellebrite. As I was going through the images from that phone, I found an image of Trump and 
Ghislaine Maxwell on Bannon's phone (see screenshot from Cellebrite, attached). I discussed with Sunny and we wanted 
to flag this for you, in case it was of any importance to you, since you are on both cases. 
Please let me know if you'd like anything further done with this. Thanks so much!

Yeah, that doesn't sound right. CART did this once last winter, but screwed it up, and we couldn't use it in the format they 
made for us — the FBI can, so it is possible what she is hearing is that her team has access to some number of these 
devices. But we have nothing. And I have personally been on calls with the SSA and the CART folks since early April 
about fixing this problem, and they always promise to do so quickly, and tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow...

As expected, FBI is pretty resistant to using a vendor. I explained to 
that we just can't mess around with this 
anymore. She is going to get updated information about status and we will talk again later today (her team told her that 
we have been provided with roughly 30 of 52 devices, so obviously our information is not matching up).

Pretty sure it's everything. The estimate references 57 devices, as noted below, I think we're now up to 62, but we're into 
one of them, so really 61. We can get an updated estimate for the 61 if that would be helpful, but given how much 
business the PC unit gives 
he should be good to us on that...

Yes, there are a total of 62 devices which can be divided into three main buckets based on how/where we obtained them, 
the second and third of which are by far and away the biggest: 
• 
Phone and 1 iPad seized from Epstein at the time of his arrest on July 6, 2019. The FBI first delivered copies of 
the extractions from these devices last week. We were able to review the iPad, but we have not been able to 
open the iPhone data. IS THIS AN FBI TRANSMISSION ISSUE WITH THE IPHONE DATA, OR IS IT THAT IT WAS UN-
OPENABLE? 
• 
electronic devices seized from the New York residence on July 11, 2019. These include multiple hard drives, 
multiple computers, multiple USB drives, and multiple iPads. We currently have extractions from/access to none 
of them.

On this issue of the Epstein devices, the team got an estimate from BRG that seems reasonable in terms of both cost

you're around or early next week if that's better. Thanks

Following up on the below, I think we've given this our absolute best efforts with FBI — they are now well over a 
month later than their estimate from April on when we would get the New York materials, they're also past their 
estimate of getting us the New York materials from just this Monday, and we don't have anything close to an 
estimate on the USVI materials, which constitute the overwhelming majority of the data and are vastly more 
voluminous than the New York devices. We have kept pushing the timeline back for this option, hoping that CART 
will finalize, but I think at this point we should have a vendor do it. 
Attached is an estimate we got from BRG, which would get everything to us in under a month, and in Relativity-
friendly format, in a range of $85-135K. BRG has done this for our office multiple times in the past and are very 
effective and efficient, and they get the materials we need. And most importantly, they estimate they can do it all in 
less than a month. May we have approval to seek funding for this? The estimate is attached. Thanks very much.

You are getting both NY and USVI. The biggest stumbling block are the newer Mac items that are in APFS 
(there are a bunch from the Island,) so it is difficult to estimate how long those will take until I see how 
many items I have to export.

I am in the process ofAtoorting the materials (documents, spreadsheets, emails, etc) for your review as per 
my discussions with =. 
Most of the NY stuff is done, just Mac items left. This might take a few days as 
item in particular has over 500,000 emails. We will be able to provide discovery once Defense Council 
has provided drives for us to copy items over to. This goes quicker as there is no processing involved. I'll let 
you know when everything is complete.

Unfortunately, recent events and our staffing levels have conspired to put a kink in just about everything. If 
we can't make heads or tails of the stuff I've already produced, we'll do it again. They have told us that our 
staffing levels will be steadily increasing over the next few weeks, but I'm going to have to push back my

Thanks for this, it's a helpful start. In terms of being able to write our search warrant, one additional piece of 
information we need is the serial number, or some other specific identifier, ideally for each device but at least for any 
device that there is more than one of the same thing. So for example, we need to be able to somehow differentiate 
the following devices —
The two Dell power edge T310 hard drives (NYCO24323 and NYCO24324) 
The two Sony Vaio laptop / Fujitsu hdd (NYCO24336 and NYCO24337) 
the following loose storage devices: 
o Micro SD card (NYCO24339) 
o Flash Drive (generic) (NYCO24340) 
o Thumbdrive (Emtec) (NYCO24341) 
o hard drive (loose) (NYCO24342) 
o verbatim thumbdrive (NYCO24343) 
The four San Disk cruzer-thumbdrives (NYCO24344-47) 
The three Seagate IDE hard drives (NYCO24348-50) 
The camera SD card (NYCO24351) 
I think the rest of the devices are either specifically distinguishable and/or have an S/N listed. (By comparison, the 
USVI spreadsheet we have lists an s/n for about 20 of the 25(ish) devices. 
The other thing we're looking for is the location in the house (and ideally specific location) for each device, which the 
USVI list also has — is that info available? 
The list also has just five devices as still pending to be transferred to us, and I think it's right that the plan is to 
reproduce all the materials so that we can get them in searchable format, but just wanted to confirm? Currently, we 
aren't able to match any of the prior productions to specific devices — so if we're able to match them up by Bates

Here is The listing of all the evidence gathered in NY that I have. I added some columns to guide you to the 
unique numbers CART NY uses fro their evidence. The template wasn't a slam dunk over, so I did what I 
could to convey the information. If you are confused by anything, please let me know. In the column for 
approximate size, it is in GB, totaled at the bottom and converted to TB. In the materials contained column, 
I put what load file group the data was transferred over in (Mac, Windows, Loose Media, IDE, or Blacklight) 
If there is no entry in that column, that data has yet to be transferred. There are 2 Macs and a DVR you 
don't have as well as an iPhone and an iPad. IF the descriptions are a bit light, let me know and I'll do what 
I can to beef them up. I will get you the Island stuff tomorrow.

Respectfully, I think there are some miscommunications here — all we have asked is to receive the materials in a 
format such that we can view them using a system we have access to. We're not able to get web-enabled access 
through any FBI tool, so we asked for the materials to be transferred in a loadable format so we could put them on 
Relativity, which both we and the agents can access. We're required to have the files in a format that we can 
produce them to defense counsel. I've done that in many other cases and it hasn't previously been an issue. My 
understanding from =I is that the best way to do it now is just for us (the U.S. Attorney's Office) to get the original 
files, which our vendor will process—by which I just mean converting into file formats that are loadable onto 
Relativity. It doesn't really have anything to do with the taint review—we have to have access to the docs in our 
systems for discovery purposes. 
And we were happy to get the materials as they were processed, but when we received the 1.1 million documents 
earlier this year, they were in a format that wasn't usable for the reasons described in the email I sent on March 9. 
Again, I understand from =that the best way forward is to just get copies of the materials in their original 
formats, which I understand will be segregated and designated by device. That should work for us! I was just trying 
to understand the approach, as well as the timeline. 
thanks,

Just to be clear. The US Attorney's Office (or it's contractors) are not "processing" anything. You are taking 
files that I will be extracting from processed evidence and putting them into an E-Discovery tool (Relativity) 
to do a taint review. 
Relativity is NOT a forensic tool. It is incapable of dealing with many things that are found forensically on a 
computer like free space, slack space, and system files to name a few. When we started this, and you 
insisted you do the taint review in Relativity, I warned you that it was adding months worth of work on top 
of what was already done, and that Relativity was incapable of viewing everything. You insisted we do it 
this way. So now 
and I have come up with a way to fit this round peg into this square hole. We will get 
it done. 
Sorry it has taken so long, but we are talking about terabytes worth of data over multiple forms of digital 
evidence. Phones, tablets, loose media, cameras, DVRs, servers, laptops, and desktop computers. We have 
gotten past encryption on multiple devices. When we review devices on such large cases, we usually do it 
piece by piece as things are processed, I was unaware that you didn't want to review as things were 
processed, that you wanted to do it "all at once", so that added to the delay. Sorry for that. Just a 
differentiation of methodology I suppose. 
and I feel confident that the method we have come up with will be more consistent and preserve the 
attribution of files to devices and links of e-mails to attachments that the load file generation that I did a 
while back was lacking.

Okay, so just to check, you both think that there is not a need to do a test run? You're both comfortable with just 
basically sending us copies of everything? I don't totally understand why we couldn't have done that eight months 
ago, but regardless of the passage of time, I want to make sure we understand so we can report to our supervisors. I 
assume that means that we (at the U.S. Attorney's Office and through contractors) will therefore need to do all the 
processing ourselves, correct? And thanks again to you both.

is the info in the template spreadsheet we sent earlier (that's also attached).

Unfortunately I don't think this is very helpful to us. Did you take a look at the example spreadsheet I sent on 2/24? 
The excel file you sent has descriptions that don't match up to the items listed in the search warrant returns (that we 
sent on 2/23), and we don't have the 1B or CART numbers to be able to cross-reference. We also can't tell what you 
mean by "loose media" without a specific comparison to what was seized, we don't know which items you're 
referring to as "Windows machines," and we can't tell whether the entirety of any particular item has been 
transferred, or just partial. For example, it looks like we have gotten very, very few image files, which is surprising. 
We have also encountered some very significant problems in trying to review the more than 1 million documents we 
recently received: 
The data we've received has no way to put any emails and attachments together. So if an email says, "see 
the attached flight records," for example, we have no way of linking that up with the records themselves. 
Not only is that a big problem for us in review, it's going to be a huge problem for producing the documents 
to defense counsel. 
The load file has no link to the native file, so when we load the data to the database, there's no way to have 
the native files show up in the database. Because many of the files are too large to open in the viewer, it 
effectively means that there are many files that are completely invisible to us. 
Related, the control numbers in the load file don't match up to the native files. So we have two sets of 
numbers and no way to match up anything—that is, even if we were to try to go hunt down every individual 
large file in the native files, it would be impossible. 
So the data that we most recently got, we need to get in a form that addresses those issues, and we likely will need 
to get a similar reproduction of the data we received a couple months ago. Otherwise we're sifting through more 
than a million documents without much rhyme or reason. 
I've re-attached the spreadsheet we sent last week — I think that's a good place to start in terms of our necessary 
record-keeping, and we need that info at the very least, as well as anything else you think would be useful. Also 
attaching the SW returns for reference. And again, we're happy to meet up anytime and hash all this out in person if 
that's useful.

Here is a listing of what I have already handed over in load files to the US Attorney's Office for taint review. Some 
points of clarification: There were 9 IDE hard drives found in the Manhattan apartment, they turned out to be 3 
copies of 3 drives (9 drives in total) from a July 2007 search on one of his properties. I only processed 3 (as they were 
all copies). All the loose media from the NY apartment is included. All the Windows machines from the NY apartment 
are included. Only 2 Macs from NY and 1 from the Island are included. 
I will have to more closely coordinate with whoever is loading up Relativity with the remaining Macs as the 
tool they have to be processed with does not easily re-name the load files.

Totally understand about the network issues—we can relate. I do still think it will be helpful to all sit down together 
to have an in-person discussion, to make sure everybody is on the same page. Are folks available for that next 
week? And what I think would be most helpful to facilitate that would be a spreadsheet of each separate device 
referenced in the two search warrant returns, with columns for whether we've dumped the contents, whether 
they've been reviewed and/or transferred, what portions were transferred, etc. 
Something roughly like the attached, with any other categories you think would be useful — and the info on the 
attached is mostly hypothetical, obviously, just as examples. That will help us fully understand what's been reviewed, 
transferred, and received so far, and what remains. 
(Also just on the pictures, we do want copies of those as well, please including from the discs and the devices — I 
think FBI was going to do an initial screen to make sure no CP, and since I think the answer was no, we'll need to get 
those to be able to review them as well.)

Sorry for the delayed response. They are tearing out our old network and giving us a new one, they 
mandated we delete old stuff (about 400 TB worth). Now that they are working on replacing the network, 
we can do only local work. I should be able to give you an accounting of what is what. I can say, off the top 
of my head, that all windows based items from the NY search have been handed over as well as all loose 
media. The CDs from NY only contained pictures, no documents. There are still some Apple items from NY 
that need to be produced. As far as the Island stuff goes, the 1st item on your spreadsheet, the "kitchen" mac 
has been produced. Still working on the rest.

Following up on the below from last weekend, I'm still not sure how we're addressing this so I thought it would make 
sense for us to all schedule a (hopefully relatively brief) meeting to all get on the same page? We didn't hear back on 
which files had previously been provided, but our tech folks did their best to differentiate, and we got access to the 
materials yesterday and its well over a million documents, and we don't have any idea what we're looking at — i.e., 
EFTA00026421
--- PAGE 18 ---
which devices the materials came from, whether it's full or partial results, how many more devices we have coming, 
etc. 
Based on the attached search warrant returns, it looks like from the New York mansion (the PDF) there are 
approximately 40 devices that would have storage (computers, hard drives, thumb drives, etc.) and that's not even 
counting at least 60+ CDs. And then from the Virgin Islands (the Excel spreadsheet), at least more than 25 devices, 
including multiple servers / server racks. 
So we gotta know what we've already received, what remains, anticipated schedule, etc, and I know it's a lot of 
moving pieces on all sides so wanted to loop in everybody at once. The case team will be in California this coming 
week from Tuesday through Friday, but then I think generally around the first week of March, which will hopefully be 
plenty of time to schedule a productive meeting. 
thanks all,

I'm not sure who's the exact right person to ask this, so wanted to get everybody on one email chain about it — I have 
the hard drive that 
dropped off that has new Epstein search warrant materials, but it looks like there are also 
old materials (that I think we had previously received and uploaded??) on the hard drive, and so I'm not sure what's 
new. 
Just generally, and 
and I talked about this last week too, but it's basically impossible for us to keep track of 
what we're getting, and what has been completed, without some kind of identification or labeling system, along with 
a list of which devices have been extracted and downloaded. 
So for example on the hard drive currently, there are 38 folders labeled "loadFiles" through "37loadFiles" with a 
modified date of 11/14/19, which I think we may have already previously received — but I'm not sure, because we 
haven't gotten any info on which folders match up to which devices, etc. And then there's another folder titled 
"NYC024362" that has a modified date of 1/27/20, so I think that may be the materials we hadn't previously 
received? That folder by itself has more than 600,000 items. 
I don't want to give 
anything that we've already previously received and uploaded, and I can't tell from the 
folder or file names whether everything on the drive is new, or whether just additional materials were saved onto it 
in addition to what we already have. =, 
are you able to give us some guidance on this? Ultimately what we 
really need is a spreadsheet of every device, whether it's been dumped (or partially dumped), and then identifying 
that same info — which device, and what materials from it — are being given to us with each data transfer. Otherwise 
I think organizationally and for review purposes it will be a total disaster for us. 
We're happy to have a meeting on this if that's helpful — and thanks everybody for the assistance.

Subject: PPP puzzle 
Date: Tue, 07 Jul 2020 11:09:20 +0000 
Bloomberg 
Good morning. Here's what you need to know to start your day. 
• Venture capital firms deny seeking PPP loans. 
• The Fed's Bostic warns the recovery is stalling. 
• Ghislaine Maxwell arrives in New York for hearing. 
Five Things You Need to Know 
A handful of venture capital firms said they didn't seek bailouts or get 
money even though yesterday's list of PPP recipients showed otherwise. 
Index Ventures and Foundation Capital, both listed as having been 
approved for more than $1 million, are among those saying they never 
applied for funding. Andreessen Horowitz's loan in question went to a 
portfolio company for which it's the beneficial owner. 
The list also included: Companies with ties to President Trump, more 
than 88,000 loans for religious organizations, a number of investment firms 
and some nonprofit groups that advocate against such massive 
government spending. Chinese companies including conglomerate HNA 
and affiliates of a state-owned defense giant were among recipients. Jacob 
Gottlieb, whose $8 billion hedge fund shut amid an insider trading 
scandal also appeared. And agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting 
companies got at least $6.4 billion. 
Virus latest: Novavax got a $1.6 billion U.S. award for vaccine 
development. Shares jumped 27% premarket. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance 
Bottoms said she tested positive. Texas cases rose 2.7%, pushing total 
infections above 200,000. Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro underwent another test 
after showing symptoms. The Australian state of Victoria announced a six-
week lockdown across metropolitan Melbourne. Follow the developments 
with our Virus Update. 
EFTA00026424
--- PAGE 2 ---
Europe's economy will be hit more than previously estimated this year 
and take longer to recover, the European Commission said. It sees euro-
area GDP slumping 8.7%, a percentage point deeper than it predicted in 
May, with risks high and mainly to the downside. Forecasts for France, 
Italy and Spain were lowered to contractions of more than 10%, while 
Germany was upgraded a tad to -6.3%. 
U.S. futures fell with shares in Europe and Asia. Treasuries and the dollar 
rose. Oil and gold declined. The Aussie slipped after Melbourne was 
locked down. All Stoxx Europe 600 industry groups declined and Bayer 
slid after its plan for handling future Roundup cancer claims hit a snag. In 
Asia, Chinese stocks powered ahead for a sixth day. 
Map of the Day 
Keystone XL hit a roadblock. The Supreme Court voted to bar U.S. 
construction on the oil-sands pipe, dealing a blow to Trump's bid to 
proceed and to Canadian producers wanting to move more oil across the 
border. Most work will be delayed to next year, unless Joe Biden wins the 
election that is. He's vowed to veto the project.

What to Keep an Eye On 
The U.S. rebound is at risk of stalling because of the Sun Belt infection 
spike, Fed official Raphael Bostic said. High-frequency data showed a 
EFTA00026425
--- PAGE 3 ---
leveling off of business openings and mobility, the Atlanta Fed chief told 
the FT. The trajectory will be "a bit bumpier than it might otherwise." 
The U.S. may ban TikTok. Michael Pompeo told Fox he's looking at a ban 
on Chinese social media apps, specifically TikTok. The company 
will remove its app from Hong Kong stores in coming days, the first 
internet service to exit the city after China enacted new national security 
laws. Its pullout may benefit Beijing by removing a forum pro-democracy 
protesters use to post videos. 
Tech industry concerns overshadowed Samsung's profit beat. Operating 
profit of 8.1 trillion won ($6.8 billion) beat consensus for 6.2 trillion won. 
Shares fell as the figures were helped by a one-time gain in the display 
business, which some analysts estimated was more than 1 trillion won in 
compensation from Apple for fewer-than-promised display orders, 
suggesting weakness in the sector. 
Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Sundar Pichai and Tim Cook will testify to 
Congress on July 27 The appearances before a panel investigating 
competition in the tech industry may be virtual. It's Bezos's first time to 
testify. Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg are set to meet 
today, after major advertisers boycotted Facebook for not doing enough to 
combat racism and voter suppression. 
civil rights leaders 
Opinion 
China's future credibility will be determined by how it treats Hong Kong, 
Bloomberg Opinion's editors write. Beijing may have imposed the national 
security law because its believes Western rivals are in disarray, or to 
distract from its weakened economy. Nations should oppose 
China's attempts to assert territorial claims by force, weaken international 
institutions and advance goals through intimidation. 
This may be the time for investors who want to save the Brazilian 
Amazon, writes Clara Ferreira Marques for Bloomberg Opinion. They can 
support green incentives or threaten to divest with the promise to reinvest 
if behavior improves. Investors can't dictate government action, but they 
can point to portfolio risk and cause plenty of pain. Money talks. 
What Everybody's Talking About 
EFTA00026426
--- PAGE 4 ---
The woman who called the police on a Black man watching birds in 
Central Park in May was charged with falsely reporting an incident, a 
misdemeanor. Amy Cooper, who's White, accused the bird watcher, 
Christian Cooper (no relation), of threatening to attack her after he asked 
her to keep her dog on a leash. A video of the encounter was posted to 
Facebook, where it went viral. 
Ghislaine Maxwell, who's being held in a federal jail in New York, is likely 
to be formally charged and enter a plea on July 14. District Judge Alison 
Nathan proposed the hearing be held by videoconference. The former 
Jeffrey Epstein associate agreed to the remote hearing and the date in a 
letter to the judge. 
By the Way 
The Kansas City Chiefs locked in the NFL's most dynamic player for 
another decade. Quarterback Patrick Mahomes agreed to a 10-year 
extension worth up to $503 million, the AP reported. Mahomes, 24, took 
the Chiefs to their first Super Bowl title in 50 years. It's the richest contract 
in professional sports history, surpassing Mike Trout's $426.5 million deal 
with the Angels.

With apologies for bothering you with this, we have hit just a complete brick wall with the FBI Information Management 
Division person we're interacting with, attempting to get a copy of their scans of the FBI case file — the below emails are 
the first and then most recent email communications we've had with her, but in between are at least a dozen other 
unreturned emails and phone calls since January, from both me and 
is perfectly pleasant when we're able to 
connect with her, but everything is always a "few days" from being done, which then turns into weeks on end. 
I'd like to enlist the help of someone with more influence than we seem to have at the line level—I'm happy to call the 
DAAG who offered to help if we had any logistical issues, or alternatively the only other person I can identify online as 
having supervisory authority at IMD is 
whom I'm happy to contact, but he's an Assistant Director, so it 
would be jumping many layers of command. So wanted to check with you on what you think would be most appropriate 
in terms of elevating? 
Happy to discuss in person if that's useful, and thanks very much for the help.

Wanted to quickly check in to follow up on our conversations last week and earlier this week — I think you were able to 
transmit the scanned records to S 
but I'm not sure whether that was just the 16,000 pages you mentioned when we 
last spoke, or if you were able to get all 29,000 to her? And we're also hoping to confirm for sure that all the materials 
you received were definitely scanned in, and to get an index or catalog of those materials (including what media was 
included). 
Another person on our team, 
Kurland, who's copied, is jumping in to coordinate on this, so if it's easier to chat via 
phone her number is 
and please let us know if anything would be helpful on our end.

Following up on our Brass meeting just now, It's that time of year when we need to do forfeiture funding requests. These 
are basically short write-ups of cases that may involve forfeiture and are also likely to incur significant investigative costs 
(e.g., traveling to Florida a dozen times, hiring a vendor retaining an expert). Could you guys do a super quick Epstein 
write up this afternoon and send it back to me (unfortunately need to get these done today— sorry for the short notice)? 
I've attached a blank form and a go-by (you'll see just how short these can be). 
Also, notwithstanding what the form says, please do NOT email it down to DC — please send it back to me. 
Thanks,

crimes, respectively. The investigation arises from conduct alleged to have occurred from in or 
about the 1990s through at least in or about 2007. 
Epstein is alleged to have engaged in a years-long pattern of enticing minor girls to 
engage in sex acts, starting with massages and escalating to acts including sexual intercourse, 
often in exchange for money. He has undertaken this conduct in at least New York, Florida, the 
U.S. Virgin Islands, New Mexico, and certain cities abroad. Esptain was assisted by individuals, 
including employees, girlfriends and friends, in the recruitment and enticement of the minors, 
and he paid certain minors to recruit additional underage girls. 
We estimate that there are at least 50 victims who were abused in New York, Florida and 
elsewhere, and who currently live throughout the United States and abroad. Significant 
investigative costs include frequent travel to interview victims and witnesses, and hiring a vendor 
to process voluminous paper records and media, among other costs.

I received your email after hours yesterday and just haven't had a chance to respond yet. 
Your client came in close contact with a staff member who tested positive. Out of an abundance of caution and for the 
safety of Ms. Maxwell, staff, visitors and other inmates, MDC Brooklyn has placed Ms Maxwell in quarantine status. She as 
you are aware was tested into quarantine and will be tested out in approximately 14 days. Once all the tests are negative 
she will be placed out of quarantine. Her legal calls and discovery will continue. She will be unable to have in person legal 
visits to protect visitors from potential exposure.

Yes, that sounds about right to me. As I recall, there were not a lot of emails between Epstein and Maxwell, and the 
majority of the Maxwell emails came from just one of the thumb drives in the New York residence.

ood morning and welcome to Notes on the News. 
It's Tuesday, Jan. 26. Here's what you should 
know today: Leon Black is stepping down, Moderna is 
testing a vaccine booster shot as new virus strains 
spread and Dominion Voting is suing Rudy Giuliani 
for $1.3 billion. 
Let us know what you think by replying to this email.

1. Apollo's Leon Black will exit following probe. The fund's chief executive 
will cede his role by July 31 after an independent report found he had made a larger-
than-expected $148 million payment to Jeffrey Epstein for legitimate advice. Black 
wasn't involved in the disgraced financier's criminal activities, the report said. 
2. Senate confirms Janet Yellen as treasury secretary. The former Fed 
chairwoman will spearhead President Biden's push for a $1.9 trillion economic relief 
package, which provides for another round of direct stimulus payments, extended 
and enhanced jobless benefits, funding for schools and first responders and the 
creation of a nationwide vaccination program. 
3. Article of impeachment sent to the Senate for second Trump trial. The 
case is expected to highlight the rifts within the GOP over former President Donald 
EFTA00026469
--- PAGE 4 ---
Trump's legacy and his future influence over the party. However, many aides were 
skeptical that 17 Republican senators would join all Democrats and vote to convict 
him. 
4. Amazon continues its U.S. expansion. The tech giant is planning to add 
3,000 employees in the Boston area, one of a number of expansions of technology 
jobs in major American cities. The jobs will include roles in technology and software 
development. 
5. Saved stimulus checks are expected to help spur an economic 
recovery. Many households have boosted their savings during the pandemic, and 
the pent-up demand for services like travel and dining is expected to propel 
economic growth once vaccines become widespread. 
E WSJ NEWS EXCLUSIVE 
6. Business Insider's pandemic strategy paid off. Many business leaders 
responded to the Covid-19 crisis with a flurry of activity and strategy shifts, but the 
business-news site chose to do nothing  and let the storm  pass. It generated 3096 
revenue growth in 2020, benefiting from a burgeoning subscription business and a 
form of automated advertising. 
7. Judge approves $17 million fund for Harvey Weinstein victims. Women 
who have accused the former Hollywood producer of sexual misconduct are expected 
on average to receive hundreds of thousands of dollars under the deal.

13% 
The approximate share of the U.K.'s gross domestic product that comes 
from recreation, culture and hospitality spending—a higher amount than any other 
CT-7 economy. As the pandemic hammered in-person businesses last year, the U.IC's 
economy shrank more than all other CT-7 nations—the U.S., France, Germany, Italy, 
Canada and Japan. 
19.2% — The rate at which National Football League teams have attempted a 
fourth-down conversion this season, the highest frequency since at least 1991. In the 
NFL, such conversion attempts used to be rare, but the increased use of data 
analytics in the league has seen teams increasingly realize that it can sometimes be a 
savvy move. The Kansas City Chiefs and the New England Patriots both recently 
advanced to the Super Bowl by using that tactic.

GameStop's stock is reaching new heights. Prompted in part by a popular 
Reddit forum, individual investors are buying up the videogame retailer's stock, 
facing off with those on Wall Street who were holding short positions. The rally 
resulted in a short squeeze, which is when rising prices prompt investors to buy back 
shares they had sold short to cut their losses, pushing the stock higher still. At its 
peak on Monday, GameStop's share price surged as much as 145% to hit $159.18.

Dominion Voting Systems is suing Rudy Giuliani for $1.3 billion. 
EFTA00026473
--- PAGE 8 ---
The election-equipment maker claims in a defamation lawsuit that former President 
Trump's personal lawyer and his allies spread false allegations against the company 
that "foreseeably went viral and deceived millions of people into believing that 
Dominion had stolen their votes and fixed the election." Dominion's voting machines 
are used by more than 40% of U.S. voters. Since November, Trump allies, right-wing 
media personalities and others have targeted the company with unsubstantiated 
allegations that it rigged the vote, and the company says its employees have received 
death threats. Giuliani, who led Trump's legal team during his string of failed court 
challenges to states' vote counts, was among the highest-profile promoters of 
allegations against Dominion. He said the lawsuit was "another act of intimidation 
by the hate-filled left-wing to wipe out and censor the exercise of free speech." 
The pandemic has prevented many refugees from resettling. 
Nearly 1.5 million refugees were in urgent need of resettlement through the United 
Nations last year, but just 22,70 people had the chance, according to the U.N. 
Restrictions on international travel meant that refugees who had already waited 
years for asylum requests to be granted were forced to wait months for national 
borders to reopen to them. Last year saw the lowest number of refugees resettled 
since at least 2003, and those entering the U.S. fell to the lowest level in the 40-year 
history of its refugee program after the Trump administration capped admittances. 
Moderna is developing a vaccine booster shot for the South African 
coronavirus strain. 
The drugmaker said its Covid-19 vaccine appeared to protect against emerging 
variants of the coronavirus in lab tests. As a precaution, however, it is working to see 
whether a booster shot improves immune responses and the company said it could 
develop a new vaccine targeting the strain first identified in South Africa. A variant 
that also appears to be more deadly has been identified in the U.K. and the U.S. The 
new strains appear to spread more easily, and if existing vaccines do produce a 
weaker immune response, the virus could continue to mutate significantly as 
countries inoculate more of their populations. The South African variant hasn't been 
identified in the U.S., and to curb the spread of new strains, Biden restricted travel 
from South Africa and re-established a ban on most travel into the U.S. from Europe, 
the U.K. and Brazil.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
United States of America, 
—v—
Ghislaine Maxwell, 
Defendant. 
USDC SONY 
DOCUMENT 
ELECTRONICALLY PILED 
DOC M: 
DATE FILED:10/22/21 
20-CR-330 (MN) 
ORDER 
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
For the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's conference, the Court will implement 
the following procedures for jury selection: 
• 
A screening questionnaire will be administered on November 4, 5, and 12. 
• 
The Clerk's Office will create a corresponding list of names and randomly assigned juror 
numbers. The list will be provided to counsel and the Court for use throughout jury 
selection. Jurors will be identified on the questionnaire and in court throughout the 
process by their assigned number only. 
• 
Completed questionnaires will be copied and distributed to defense counsel by the U.S. 
Attorney's Office. 
• 
After reviewing the completed questionnaires, counsel must confer in good faith and 
jointly submit four lists: (1) prospective jurors that both sides agree should proceed to 
voir dire; (2) prospective jurors that both sides agree should be excused; (3) prospective 
jurors that the defense, but not the Government believes should be excused; and (4) 
prospective jurors that the Government, but not the defense believes should be excused. 
EFTA00026484
--- PAGE 2 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 364 Filed 10/22/21 Page 2 of 3 
o Lists for questionnaires completed on November 4 and 5 will be due to the Court 
via email by November 7. 
o Lists for questionnaires completed on November 12 will be due to the Court via 
email by November 13. 
o If necessary, there will be an in-person conference on November 15 at 9:30 a.m. 
to resolve any disputes. 
• 
Voir dire will proceed on November 16-19. The Court will conduct one-on-one voir dire 
with each prospective juror in the presence of the parties and with public access to the 
proceeding. At the conference, both sides indicated the potential need for additional 
procedures during voir dire under certain circumstances. See Transcript at 10-11. As 
the Court indicated, it will consider proposed narrowly tailored measures that may be 
necessary during voir dire on a case-by-case basis. See id. at 12. 
• 
The Court will decide in due course whether the exercise of peremptory strikes will 
proceed on November 19 or November 29. 
The Court implements these procedures taking into account the significant publicity this case has 
garnered, the nature of the charges, and the District's COVID-19 protocols. These procedures are 
carefully balanced and tailored to ensure the safety of the parties and prospective jurors in light 
of the continuing pandemic; to ensure juror candor, impartiality, and privacy; and to ensure the 
First Amendment right to public access of criminal proceedings. 
Also for the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's conference, the request to seal the 
parties' proposed questionnaire and voir dire and the Court's draft questionnaire and voir dire 
until after jury selection is completed is denied. Although the Court has and will continue to 
implement tailored measures to ensure a fair trial despite significant media interest, see Dkt. Nos.

28, 81, 95, 99, 101, 232, 241, 284, 301, 315, the defense did not justify sealing the entirety of the 
proposed and draft questionnaires and voir dire. See Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 
F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). The Court's planned individual voir dire process is designed to 
carefully probe the prior exposure to and the potential influence of any pre-trial media. As noted 
at the conference, the parties may continue to propose for the Court's consideration, any 
appropriate and tailored procedures in light of the specific factors related to this case and 
upcoming trial.

Information

Cell hones 
Assigned Call Numbers 
and 
USAO Reference 
No. 2018R01618 
APPLICATION 
Mag. 6770
Application for Warrants and Orders 
for Cellphone Location and Pen Register Information 
The United States of America, by its attorney, 
Acting United States 
Attorney for the Southern District of New York, 
Assistant United States 
Attorney, of counsel, respectfully requests that the Court issue the accompanying proposed 
Warrants and Orders for prospective and historical location information and pen register 
information for two cellphones. As grounds for this Application the Government relies on the 
following facts and authorities. 
I. Introduction 
I. I am an Assistant United States Attorney in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern 
District of New York. This Application is submitted in conjunction with the accompanying 
affidavit of a law enforcement agent ("Agent Affidavit"), to be sworn before this Court, and 
incorporated by reference herein. I make this Application based on information and belief, 
including the Agent Affidavit, my review of other documents in the case, and information received 
from investigative personnel. 
2. The Investigating Agency, Target Cellphones, Subscribers, Target Subject, Service 
Providers, Subject Offenses, Successor Service Provider, and Successor Cellphone referenced in 
this Application are as specified in the Agent Affidavit. 
2019.07.24 
EFTA00026494
--- PAGE 2 ---
II. Legal Authority 
A. Prospective Location Information 
3. The Government seeks to obtain both precision location information and cell site data 
for the Target Cellphones on a prospective basis (the "Prospective Location Information") for a 
period of 45 days from the date of this order — the same period of time for which a warrant for a 
tracking device may be granted under Rule 41(e)(2)(C). It bears noting, however, that while the 
Prospective Location Information may permit "tracking" the user of the phone in the colloquial 
sense, this is not an application for a warrant for a "tracking device" as defined in Fed. R. Crim. 
P. 41(a)(2)(E) and 18 U.S.C. § 3117(b). Those provisions only apply where an agent is seeking to 
physically install a tracking device on a given object. 
Instead, the Prospective Location 
Information will be obtained by requiring the Service Provider to provide the information. 
4. The authority for this application is found in 18 U.S.C. § 2703(c)(1), which authorizes 
a court of competent jurisdiction to require any electronic communication service provider (which 
includes a cellular telephone service provider') to disclose any "record or other information 
pertaining to a subscriber other than the "contents of communications," when the government 
obtains, inter cilia, a warrant under the applicable procedures of Rule 41. See 18 U.S.C. § 
2703(cX1)(A). Because data concerning a subscriber's location, such as precision location 
information and cell site data, constitutes "information pertaining to a subscribe?' that does not 
include the "contents of communications," that data is among the types of information available 
See 18 U.S.C. § 2711(1) (incorporating by cross-reference statutory definitions set forth in 18 
U.S.C. § 2510); 18 U.S.C. § 2510(15) (defining "electronic communication service" as "any 
service which provides to users thereof the ability to send or receive wire or electronic 
communications"). 
2019.07.24 
EFTA00026495
--- PAGE 3 ---
under § 2703(c)(1)(A).2 Further, as specified in 18 U.S.C. § 2711(3), this Court is a court of 
competent jurisdiction under the Stored Communications Act because it has jurisdiction over the 
Subject Offenses. 
5. The Government's request for cell site data also implicates the pen register statute, 
because such data constitutes signaling information used by the Service Providers to route 
communications to and from the Target Cellphones. In order to collect such data, a valid pen 
register order is required.3 Accordingly, I hereby certify pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3122 that such 
signaling information is relevant to an ongoing investigation being conducted by the Investigating 
Agency into suspected violations of the Subject Offenses by the Target Subject. 
B. Historical Location Information 
6. The Government also seeks historical cell site data for the Target Cellphones for the 
period from June I, 2020 to the present (the "Historical Location Information"). Because such 
data—like "Prospective Location Information"—constitutes information concerning a subscriber, 
the Court is authorized to order the Service Providers to provide this data pursuant to a warrant 
See In re Application, 460 F. Supp. 2d 448, 459-60 & n. 55 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (Kaplan, J.) 
(cellphone location information falls within § 2703(c)(1)); accord, e.g., United States v. Caraballo, 
963 F. Supp. 2d 341, 361 (D.Vt. 2013); In re Order, 632 F. Supp. 2d 202, 207 (E.D.N.Y. 2008); 
In re Application, 405 F. Supp. 2d 435, 444-45 (S.D.N.Y. 2005). But see In re Application, 849 
F. Supp. 2d 526, 574 (D.Md. 2011) (rejecting view that cellular location data falls within the scope 
of the SCA and finding that phone must be treated as "tracking device" for purposes of Rule 41 
where used to collect location data); In re Application, 2009 WL 159187, at *5-'1'6 (S.D.N.Y. 
Jan.13, 2009) (McMahon, J.) (same). 
See 18 U.S.C. § 3121 (prohibiting use of pen register or trap and trace device without an order 
under the pen register statute); 3127(3) & (4) (defining pen register and trap and trace device to 
include devices or processes that record, inter alio, signaling information). Although cell site data 
constitutes "signaling" information within the meaning of the pen register statute, a separate statute 
precludes the Government from relying "solely" on the authority provided by the pen register 
statute to ascertain a subscriber's location. 47 U.S.C. § 1002(a). Here, the Government seeks to 
obtain such data pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2703(c) as well as the pen register statute, rather than 
"solely" under the latter statute. See In re Application, 460 F. Supp. 2d at 456-59. 
2019.07.24 
EFTA00026496
--- PAGE 4 ---
application under 18 U.S.C. § 2703(c), under the applicable procedures of Rule 41. See 18 U.S.C. 
§ 2703(c)(1)(A). I respectfully submit that the same probable cause supporting the Government's 
request for a warrant to obtain the Prospective Location Information requested above also supports 
the issuance of a warrant under § 2703(c) for the requested Historical Location Information. In 
addition, the Government seeks toll records for the same period as the Historical Location 
Information. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2703(d), I respectfully submit that the Agent Affidavit offers 
specific and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the toll 
record information sought is relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation. 
C. Pen Register Information 
7. Finally, the Government seeks an order pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §§ 3121-26 authorizing 
the use of a pen register on the Target Cellphones for a period of 45 days from the date of this 
order. Specifically, the Government seeks an order directing the Service Providers to furnish any 
information, facilities, and technical assistance necessary to operate, unobtrusively and with 
minimum disruption of service, a pen register and trap and trace device to capture all dialing, 
routing, addressing, or signaling information associated with each call transmitted to or from the 
Target Cellphones, as specified further in the proposed Warrants and Orders (the "Pen Register 
Information").4
The Government is also not seeking authorization to obtain post-cut-through dialed digits 
("PCTDD"), or digits that are dialed after a telephone call from the Target Cellphones has been 
connected. Pursuant to the attached Order, if possible, the Service Provider will forward only pre-
cut-through-dialed digits to the Investigating Agency. 
However, if the Service Providers' 
technical capabilities require it to forward all dialed digits, including PCTDD, to the Investigating 
Agency, the Investigating Agency will only decode and forward to the agents assigned to the 
investigation the numbers that are dialed before the call is cut through. 
2019.07.24 
EFTA00026497
--- PAGE 5 ---
8. I hereby certify pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3122 that the Pen Register Information is 
relevant to an ongoing investigation being conducted by the Investigating Agency into suspected 
violations of the Subject Offenses by the Target Subject. 
D. Sealing and Non-Disclosure Order to Service Providers 
9. When the Government obtains records or information under § 2703(c), it is not required 
to notify the subscriber or customer. 18 U.S.C. § 2703(c)(3). Additionally, the Government may 
obtain an order precluding the Service Providers from notifying the subscriber or any other third-
party of the warrant or order obtained, for such period as the Court deems appropriate, where there 
is reason to believe that such notification will result in endangering the life or physical safety of 
an individual, flight from prosecution, destruction of or tampering with evidence, or intimidation 
of potential witnesses, or will otherwise seriously jeopardize the investigation. 18 U.S.C. 
§ 2705(b). 
10. Further, 18 U.S.C. § 3I23(d) provides that an order directing installation of a pen 
register or trap and trace device shall direct the pertinent service provider "not to disclose the 
existence of the pen register or trap and trace device or the existence of the investigation to the 
listed subscriber, or to any other person unless or until otherwise ordered by the Court." 
II. Accordingly, as explained further in the Agent Affidavit, in light of the confidential 
nature of the continuing criminal investigation and the adverse consequences expected in the event 
of premature notification, the Government respectfully requests that the Court direct the Service 
Providers not to notify the Subscribers or any other person of the Warrants and Orders sought 
herein for a period of one year, subject to extension upon application to the Court, if necessary. 
12. For similar reasons, I respectfully request that the proposed Warrants and Orders, this 
Application, and the accompanying Agent Affidavit, be maintained under seal until the Court 
orders otherwise, except that the Government be permitted without further order of this Court to 
2019.07.24

--- PAGE 6 ---
serve these Warrants and Orders on the Service Providers; provide copies of the Warrants and 
Orders or the supporting Application and Agent Affidavit as need be to personnel assisting the 
Government in the investigation and prosecution of this matter; and disclose these materials as 
necessary to comply with discovery and disclosure obligations in any prosecutions related to this 
matter. 
III. Prior Requests 
13. Except as may be set forth above, no prior request for the relief requested herein has 
been made.

Agent Affidavit in Support of Warrants and Orders 
for Cellphone Location and Pen Register Information 
STATE OF NEW YORK 
) 
) ss. 
COUNTY OF NEW YORK ) 
being duly sworn, deposes and states: 
1. Introduction 
I. I have been a Special Agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI" or 
"Investigating Agency") since 2017. As such, I am a "federal law enforcement officer within the 
meaning of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41(a)(2)(C), that is, a government agent engaged 
in enforcing the criminal laws and duly authorized by the Attorney General to request a search 
warrant. I am currently assigned to investigate violations of criminal law relating to the sexual 
exploitation of children as part of an FBI Task Force. I have gained expertise in this area through 
classroom training and daily work related to these types of investigations. As part of my 
responsibilities, I have been involved in the investigation of cases involving sex trafficking, 
enticement of minors, and transportation of minors for illegal sex acts, and have participated in the 
execution of search warrants involving electronic evidence. 
2. Requested Information. I respectfully submit this Affidavit pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 
§§ 2703(c) and (c)(1)(A) and the applicable procedures of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41; 
2019.07.24 
EFTA00026500
--- PAGE 8 ---
U.S.C. §§ 2703(d) & 2705; and 18 U.S.C. §§ 3121-3126, in support of two warrants and orders 
for prospective location information, historical location information, toll records, and pen register 
information, for the Target Cellphones identified below (collectively, the "Requested 
Information"). 
3. Basis for Knowledge. This Affidavit is based upon my participation in the 
investigation, my examination of reports and records, and my conversations with other law 
enforcement agents and other individuals, as well as my training and experience. Because this 
Affidavit is being submitted for the limited purpose of obtaining the Requested Information, it 
does not include all the facts that I have learned during the course of this investigation. Where the 
contents of documents and the actions, statements, and conversations of others are reported herein, 
they are reported in substance and in part, except where otherwise indicated. In addition, unless 
otherwise indicated, statements by others referenced in this Affidavit were not necessarily made 
to me, but may have been provided to me by someone else to whom I have spoken or whose report 
I have read (and who in turn may have had either direct or indirect knowledge of the statement). 
Similarly, unless otherwise indicated, information in this Affidavit resulting from surveillance 
does not necessarily set forth my personal observations, but may have been provided to me by 
other law enforcement agents who observed the events, and to whom I have spoken or whose 
report I have read. 
4. Target Cellphones, Subscribers, Target Subject, and Service Providers. The 
Target Cellphones referenced in this Affidavit are the cellphone assigned call number 
("Target Cellphone-1") and the cellphone assigned call number 
("Target 
Cellphone-2," and collectively with Target Cellphone-1, the "Target Cellphones"). As further 
discussed below, Target Cellphone-1 is subscribed to in the name of "Terramar Project, Inc." 
2019.07.24 
EFTA00026501
--- PAGE 9 ---
("Subscriber-1"), and Target Cellphone-2 is subscribed to in the name of "G Max" ("Subscriber-
2," and collectively with Subscriber-I, the "Subscribers"). GHISLAINE MAXWELL is believed 
to use the Target Cellphones and is a Target Subject of this investigation. T-Mobile is the Service 
Provider for Target Cellphone-1, and AT&T is the Service Provider for Target Cellphone-2. 
5. Precision Location Capability. 
Cellphone service providers have technical 
capabilities that allow them to collect at least two kinds of information about the locations of the 
cellphones to which they provide service: (a) precision location information, also known as E-911 
Phase II data, GPS data, or latitude-longitude data, and (b) cell site data, also known as 
"tower/face" or "tower/sector" information. Precision location information provides relatively 
precise location information about a cellphone, which a provider can typically collect either via 
GPS tracking technology built into the phone or by triangulating the device's signal as received 
by the provider's nearby cell towers. Cell site data, by contrast, reflects only the cell tower and 
sector thereof utilized in routing any communication to and from the cellphone, as well as the 
approximate range of the cellphone from the tower during the communication (sometimes referred 
to as "per-call measurement" ("PCM") or "round-trip time" ("RTT") data). Because cell towers 
are often a half-mile or more apart, even in urban areas, and can be ten or more miles apart in rural 
areas, cell site data is typically less precise than precision location information. Based on my 
training and experience, I know that the Service Providers have the technical ability to collect 
precision location information from any cellphone on its network, including by initiating a signal 
on the Service Providers' network to determine the phone's location. I further know that cell site 
2019.07.24 
EFTA00026502
--- PAGE 10 ---
data is routinely collected by the Service Providers in the course of routing calls placed to or from 
any cellphone on their network.' 
6. Successor Service Provider. Because it is possible that the Target Subject may change 
cellphone service provider during the course of this investigation, it is requested that the warrant 
and investigative order requested apply without need for further order to any Successor Service 
Provider who may provide service to the Target Cellphones during the time frames at issue herein. 
II. Facts Establishing Probable Cause 
7. Although I understand that probable cause is not necessary to obtain all of the 
Requested Information, I respectfully submit that probable cause exists to believe that the 
Requested Information will lead to the location of a person, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, to be 
arrested for the crimes of conspiracy to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in 
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; enticement of a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in 
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2422; conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in criminal 
sexual activity, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; transporting a minor with intent to engage in 
criminal sexual activity, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a); and perjury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 
§ 1623 (the "Subject Offenses"). 
8. On June 29, 2020, a grand jury in the Southern District of New York returned an 
indictment charging GHISLAINE MAXWELL with the Subject Offenses. The Indictment 
charging MAXWELL is attached as Exhibit A hereto (the "Indictment"). That same day, United 
States Magistrate Judge Lisa Margaret Smith signed a warrant for MAXWELL's arrest, which is 
attached as Exhibit B hereto (the "Arrest Warrant"). 
' Toll records are sometimes necessary or helpful in order to obtain or interpret historical cell site 
data and are therefore also requested herein. 
2019.07.24 
EFTA00026503
--- PAGE 11 ---
9. In light of these pending charges in the Indictment and the issuance of the Arrest 
Warrant, GHISLAINE MAXWELL is subject to arrest for the Subject Offenses. 
10. Based on my review of T-Mobile records, I have learned that Target Cellphone-1 is 
subscribed in the name of "Terramar Project, Inc." Based on my review of publicly available 
videos and related information, I know that GHISLAINE MAXWELL has given multiple public 
addresses in her capacity as the founder and president of an organization known as the TerraMar 
Project, a non-profit organization that, as noted, was founded and run by MAXWELL and devoted 
to ocean protection. 
II. As set forth in Paragraph 3 of Exhibit A, MAXWELL was a close associate and 
employee of Jeffrey Epstein's. Additionally, as set forth in Paragraphs 1 through 19 of Exhibit A, 
MAXWELL is charged with committing four of the Subject Offenses together with Epstein. I 
know from my participation in this investigation that on or about July 6, 2019, Epstein was arrested 
by the FBI on federal sex trafficking charges. During that arrest, the FBI seized an iPhone from 
Epstein's possession (the "Epstein Phone"). Pursuant to a judicially authorized search warrant, 
the FBI subsequently searched the contents of the Epstein Phone. Among other things, that search 
revealed that the phone number associated with Target Cellphone-1 was saved as a contact in the 
Epstein Phone under the name "Ghislaine." 
12. I further know from my review of T-Mobile records the following: 
a. Target Cellphone-1 has been active within the last 30 days. 
b. Target Cellphone-1 has been in contact with a phone subscribed to in the name 
of "Joshua Perry," which I know from my review of a law enforcement database is the name of 
the husband of a former employee of Jeffrey Epstein (the "Joshua Perry Phone"). The most recent 
contact between Target Cellphone-1 and the Joshua Perry Phone occurred in or about May 2020. 
2019.07.24 
EFTA00026504
--- PAGE 12 ---
c. Target Cellphone-1 has also been in contact with a phone subscribed to the 
business "Haddon, Morgan, & Foreman," which I know from my review of court records is the 
name of a law firm that currently represents GHISLAINE MAXWELL in civil litigation (the 
"Haddon, Morgan, & Foreman Phone"). The most recent contact between Target Cellphone-1 and 
the Haddon, Morgan, & Foreman Phone occurred in or about February 2020. 
d. Target Cellphone-1 has also been in contact with a phone subscribed to in the 
name of "Isabel Maxwell," which I know from my review of a law enforcement database is the 
name of GHISLAINE MAXWELL's sister (the "Isabel Maxwell Phone"). The most recent 
contact between Target Cellphone-1 and the Isabel Maxwell Phone occurred in or about August 
2019. 
e. Target Cellphone-1 has also been in contact with a phone subscribed to in the 
name of "Laura Menninger," which I know from my review of court records is the name of an 
attorney who currently represents GHISLAINE MAXWELL in civil litigation (the "Laura 
Menninger Phone"). 
The most recent contact between Target Cellphone-I and the Laura 
Menninger Phone occurred in or about August 2019. 
f. Target Cellphone-1 has also been in contact with a phone subscribed to in the 
name of "Scott Borgerson," which I know from my review of bank records and Amazon records 
is the name of an individual with whom GHISLAINE MAXWELL shares a joint bank account 
and to whom MAXWELL's Amazon account has sent multiple packages within approximately 
the last year (the "Scott Borgerson Phone"). The most recent contact between Target Cellphone-1 
and the Scott Borgerson Phone occurred in or about August 2019. 
13. Accordingly, I respectfully submit there is probable cause to believe that the location 
of Target Cellphone-1 will reveal the location of GHISLAINE MAXWELL.

--- PAGE 13 ---
14. Based on my review of AT&T records, I have learned that Target Cellphone-2 is 
subscribed in the name of "G Max," which appears to be a shortened version of GHISLAINE 
MAXWELL's name. I further know from my review of AT&T records that Target Cellphone-2 
has been active within the last 30 days. In particular, within the last 30 days, Target Cellphone-2 
has been in contact with the Isabel Maxwell Phone, the Laura Menninger Phone, the Haddon, 
Morgan, & Foreman Phone, and the Scott Borgerson Phone. 
15. Accordingly, I respectfully submit that there is probable cause to believe that the 
location of Target Cellphone-2 will reveal the location of GHISLAINE MAXWELL. 
III. Request for Warrants and Orders 
16. Based on the foregoing, I respectfully request that the Court require the Service 
Providers to provide the Requested Information as specified further in the Warrants and Orders 
proposed herewith, including prospective precision location and cell site data for a period of 45 
days from the date of this Order, historical cell site data and toll records for the period from June 
I, 2020 through the date of this Order, and pen register information for a period of 45 days from 
the date of this Order. 
1. 
Nondisclosure. The scope of this ongoing criminal investigation and existence of 
the Indictment and Arrest Warrant are not publicly known. As a result, premature public disclosure 
of this affidavit or the requested Warrants and Orders could alert GHISLAINE MAXWELL that 
she is under investigation and subject to arrest, causing her to destroy evidence, flee from 
prosecution, or otherwise seriously jeopardize the investigation. Specifically: 
a. As evidenced by the charges alleged in the Indictment, MAXWELL is known 
to have participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Alerting her to the existence and scope of 
the investigation may lead her to intimidate witnesses. See 18 U.S.C. § 2705(b)(1),(4). 
2019.07.24 
EFTA00026506
--- PAGE 14 ---
b. Additionally, the Target Subject is at liberty in the community. Premature 
disclosure of the existence of this application and the charges contained in the Indictment could 
result in the Target Subject fleeing from prosecution if she were made aware of the pending charges 
before arrest. See 18 U.S.C. § 2705(b)(2). 
17. Accordingly, there is reason to believe that, were the Service Providers to notify the 
subscribers or others of the existence of the warrant, the investigation would be seriously 
jeopardized. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2705(b), I therefore respectfully request that the Service 
Providers be directed not to notify the subscribers or others of the existence of the Warrants and 
Orders for a period of one year, and that the Warrants and Orders and all supporting papers be 
maintained under seal until the Court orders otherwise, as specified in the Application submitted 
in conjunction with this Affidavit.

Upon the Application and Agent Affidavit submitted by the Government in this matter: 
I. Findings 
The Court hereby finds: 
1. The Target Cellphone (the "Target Cellphone") that is the subject of this Order is 
assigned call number 
is subscribed to in the name of "Terramar Project, Inc." (the 
"Subscribe?), and is currently serviced by the Service Provider. 
2. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2703(c)(1)(A) and the applicable provisions of Rule 41 of the 
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Government's application sets forth probable cause to 
believe that the prospective and historical location information for the Target Cellphone will reveal 
the location of a person to be arrested for suspected violations of 18 U.S.C. §§ 371, 2422, 2423(a), 
and 1623 ("the Subject Offenses"). 
3. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2703(d), the Government's application also sets forth specific 
and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the toll records for 
the Target Cellphone are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation.

Agency of GHISLAINE MAXWELL and others unknown in connection with suspected violations 
of the Subject Offenses. 
5. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2705(b), there is reason to believe that notification of the 
existence of this Warrant and Order will result in flight from prosecution, and/or intimidation of 
potential witnesses, or otherwise will seriously jeopardize an ongoing investigation.

Dear Judge Parker, 
Attached for the Court's consideration, please find an amended application and amended affidavit in support of a second 
warrant and order. As detailed in the amended application and amended affidavit, this afternoon, 
realized 
that she had inadvertently included two errors in the affidavit submitted to Your Honor yesterday. Accordingly, the 
Government respectfully submits these amended materials and requests the issuance of a second warrant and order. 
If at all possible, we would be extremely grateful if the agent could please swear out this warrant today. I can be reached 
at 
and the agent can be available at any time convenient for the Court. We apologize for the error and the 
inconvenience. 
Respectfully submitted, 
Assistant United States Attorney

On 4/14/2016, three checks ($3,609,665.75, $9,031,636.31 and $1,561,387.91) totaling $14,202,689.97 were deposited 
into the UBS account titled 116 East 65th Street LLC (Y123962). UBS documents reflect that Ghislaine Maxwell is the 
owner of that account. On 4/20/16, $14,194,596.46 was transferred from UBS 116 East 65th Street account to the UBS 
account titled Ghislaine Maxwell (Y123575). 
In November of 2016, the amount of $14,250,000 was transferred from Maxwell accounts to the Angara Trust account at 
UBS.

Ed, 
Just a heads up that we are unsealing an indictment this morning against Ghislane Maxwell, an associate of Jeffrey 
Epstein, charging her with facilitating his abuse of minors. She was arrested in New Hampshire this morning, so the 
presentment will not be in SDNY. She will not appear in SDNY today. Let me know if you have any issues.

One question I had meant to ask in our call but forgot, on a separate subject — we had briefly discussed in late February 
our request for photographs and videos in the possession of the estate, and my recollection is that with respect to videos, 
the estate and trustees were not aware of being in possession of any historical surveillance-type videos (and in particular 
that any such surveillance video is regularly over-written, and so would not currently exist for any time before, for 
example, Epstein's suicide), and that separately the estate and trustees were not aware of being in possession of other 
physical video recordings. 
My recollection is that with respect to photographs, that there were some photographs in the properties that had not 
been the subject of physical search warrants, i.e., the Florida and New Mexico residences. I think we had discussed that 
EFTA00026530
--- PAGE 2 ---
the most efficient step, in the first instance, would be for us to receive digital photos of those physical photographs, to 
whatever extent they exist, but that doing so was not immediately possible at the time of our conversation in late 
February due to the estate's then-inability to retain or engage anyone to do that. 
In the first instance, please let me know if I am getting any of that wrong, and second, understanding that the 
circumstances of the pandemic may have affected this in the interim, we've been asked to again check with you about 
whether there is anyone currently working at (or reasonably able to go to) those properties who could convey 
photographs of any physical photos at those locations? If you could please let us know any sense of possibility / timing on 
that last outstanding request.

Southern District of New York 
United States Courthouse 
300 Quarropas Sower 
White Plains. New York 1060! 
January 8, 2020 
BY ECF 
The Honorable Kenneth M. Karas 
United States District Judge 
Southern District of New York 
300 Quarropas Street 
White Plains, NY 10601 
Re: 
United States v. Nicholas Tartaglione, S4 16 Cr. 832 (KMK) 
Dear Judge Karas: 
The Government respectfully submits this letter to provide a further update to the Court 
regarding the defense's request for video footage from outside the defendant's cell at the 
Metropolitan Correctional Center ("MCC") on July 22 — July 23, 2019 (the "Requested Video"). 
On or about December 19, 2019, the Government informed the Court and defense counsel that it 
had confirmed with MCC staff that the Requested Video had been preserved, and that the 
Government was working to obtain a copy from MCC. As set forth in greater detail below, the 
Government has learned that the MCC inadvertently preserved video from the wrong tier within 
the MCC, and, as a result, video from outside the defendant's cell on July 22 — 23, 2019 no longer 
exists. 
On or about July 23, 2019, at approximately 1:27 a.m., MCC corrections officers responded 
to the cell ("Cell-1") that the defendant shared with Jeffrey Epstein. On or about July 25, 2019, 
defense counsel requested that MCC preserve video footage from outside the defendant's cell from 
July 22, 2019 at 11:00 p.m. through July 23, 2019 at 4:00 a.m. From speaking with MCC legal 
counsel, the Government understands that in response to this request, MCC legal counsel looked 
up the defendant's cell in the MCC computer system and thereafter requested that MCC staff 
preserve video from outside of the cell for the requested time period. An MCC staff member 
confirmed that the video had been preserved. 
On or about January 3, 2020, the Government obtained a copy of the Requested Video 
from the MCC, and converted it into a playable format. After reviewing the video, it appeared to 
the Government that the footage contained on the Requested Video was for the correct date and 
time, but captured a different tier than the one where Cell-1 was located because the Requested 
Video did not show corrections officers responding to any of the cells seen on the video. After 
speaking with MCC legal counsel, the Government understands that the MCC computer system 
incorrectly listed the defendant's cell for the time period in question ("Cell-2"). Therefore, when 
EFTA00026545

January 8, 2020 
Page 2 of 2 
MCC legal counsel asked that the video outside of the defendant's cell be preserved, the MCC 
preserved video outside of Cell-2 instead of Cell-1. 
The Government understands from speaking with MCC legal counsel that the only other 
source of video from outside of Cell-1 would be on the DVR system that housed all video for the 
Special Housing Unit (the "SHU"). Following the death of Jeffrey Epstein at the MCC on or about 
August 10, 2019, the Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI") seized the DVR. The Government 
understands from speaking with an FBI agent that the FBI seized two DVR systems: one that 
captured video from the common area of the SHU, and one that captured the SHU tiers (the "Tier 
DVR"), including the tier where Cell-1 is located. The Government further understands that the 
FBI has determined that, on or about July 29, 2019, the Tier DVR suffered a system failure. As a 
result, the FBI been unable to recover any footage from the Tier DVR, and is unlikely to recover 
any video.

Jordan, 
Thank you again for speaking with me yesterday, and as I mentioned, my two colleagues on the Epstein investigation are 
and S 
both copied here—please feel free to be in touch with any or all of us anytime that 
would be useful. As I mentioned, we would be interested in learning the accounts of your clients, and we would—as we 
have with all the victims we've spoken to so far—engage with them with the highest levels of sensitivity, including there 
being no requirement to discuss any particular event or topic at any time. Even to the extent there are any individuals 
who would not currently be comfortable speaking with us directly, if they would permit you to provide an attorney proffer 
to us, that also could be very helpful. 
And in the first instance, to the extent this is possible, it would be very helpful for us just to be provided the names of your 
clients—we would not attempt to contact them outside of our discussions with you, but knowing who they are will help 
us inadvertently approaching individuals who are in fact represented, and would also help us identify to you any particular 
individual(s) who might be known to us already. 
We look forward to being in touch with you soon, and thank you again for being in touch. 
Regards, 
Assistant U.S. Attorney 
Southern District of New York

Okay, we'll take it off our calendar. Understanding that you provided a preliminary response when we spoke on 
Friday, I expect that the final response to that particular account, as well as the issue of Ms. 
recollection 
(if any) of any other instances more generally in which she observed Jeffrey Epstein engaged in any sexual 
activity, or observed other women or girls in sexually-suggestive circumstances (nude or partially nude in the 
presence of Epstein, for example, or in connection with massages), other than what you and/or she has already 
discussed, is of particular importance and relevance in our and our supervisors' consideration, and we will 
immediately incorporate any such response into our ongoing discussions and briefings with them whenever we 
receive it.

As we mentioned on the phone, there is a strong view that there are offenses that can be charged now, so it is also 
possible to have this discussion post-charge, but we certainly would prefer to have the conversation before that, 
and while the issues are very fresh in everyone's minds here. Our supervisor's view is that the 30th/31st is a long

As we flagged for you a week ago, and as ex
 we had a meeting with the office leadership today to discuss 
the status of the case in general and Ms. 
in particular. We continue to believe that it would be helpful to 
receive any clarifications, as well as any response to the complaint originally sent on December 4, as soon as 
possible; we are available tomorrow or over the weekend if there is a time that works for you. If it remains 
impossible to talk before Tuesday, we have 2:30 in our calendar for then, but with a hard stop at 3:30 so please 
let us know if you'd like to start the discussion earlier if you expect it might be useful to have additional time. 
More generally, you had requested the opportunity to present to the ultimate decision-makers in the case if it 
appeared that charges were likely, and based on our meeting today, the Office would like to provide you that 
opportunity. If you could please let us know what dates and times you are available in the ranges of January 15-
and 21-22, we will figure out a time when all the relevant supervisors here are available. I expect that meeting 
will include at least the U.S. Attorney, the Deputy U.S. Attorney 
and the Chief of the Criminal 
Division (
M), and some combination of the Chief Counsel 
, the Counsel 
the two Public Corruption Unit chiefs 
, the line assistants, and/or FBI 
investigative and supervisory personnel. We will be prepared to discuss that meeting with you via phone when 
we speak as well, which is one reason I note that we can begin our discussion earlier than 2:30 on Tuesday (or 
block off significant time to talk before then) if that would be useful.

Thanks very much for being in touch. We had actually planned to be in touch today—we expect that next week 
we'll be having meaningful conversations internally with supervisors about the possible / likely paths forward 
for aspects of the case including Ms. 
. In connection with that expectation, we wanted to ask if you were 
prepared (and willing) to convey to convey your client's recollection regarding the incident described in the 
complaint 
sent on December 4 (re-attaching here, specifically at page seven). To the extent you have 
additional information that would be helpful to convey, even minor, we would be available anytime in the 
coming days to do a call. If that isn't possible until you come back, obviously we understand the challenges of 
scheduling, but we had anticipated trying to see if we could schedule a call in the coming days. Please let us 
know?

Hey guys, 
CNN is pursuing a story about how 
came to our Office in 
2015/2016 to raise questions about the Epstein plea deal in Florida. Apparently through (with?) their attorney, 
they talked to a sex trafficking or human trafficking AUSA (no name yet) about the issue. The reporter believes 
that it was not raised to senior leadership at the time and it went nowhere. 
CNN doesn't plan to run something immediately but knows that another reporter has similar information, so if 
they feel their competition will go with the story, they will, too. 
Any guidance or thoughts are welcome.

U.S. Department of Justice 
United States Attorney 
Southern District of New York 
Chambers Street 
New York. New York 10007 
June 5, 2020

Robert Glassman, Esq. 
Panish Shea & Boyle LLP 
11111 Santa Monica Boulevard, Suite 700 
Los Angeles, CA 90025 
Re: 
Request for Information Relating to Jeffrey Epstein 
Dear Mr. Glassman: 
I am the Assistant U.S. Attorney ("AUSA") who will be handling the request you 
discussed with AUSA 
for certain information relating to Jeffrey Epstein. 
Because your request seeks information from Department of Justice (the "Department") 
employees acquired during and as part of their performance of their official duties, your request 
is governed by certain Department regulations—commonly referred to as Touhy regulations—
which, inter alia, prohibit any Department employee from disclosing such information "without 
prior approval of the proper Department official in accordance with §§ 16.24 and 16.25 of this 
part." 28 C.F.R. § 16.22(a); see also United States ex rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951); 
C.F.R. § 16.21 et seq. The "proper official" in this case is Geoffrey S. Berman, the United 
States Attorney for the Southern District of New York. The Touhy regulations provide a set of 
procedures for the United States Attorney to follow when considering such requests. See 28 
C.F.R. §§ 16.22(b), 16.24. 
A party seeking to obtain records or employee testimony from the Department must first 
submit a written demand. See 28 C.F.R. § 16.22. To assist the United States Attorney in 
evaluating your request, we ask that this demand provide a detailed statement of the information 
sought; the litigation for which you seek this information; the pertinence of the information 
sought to your litigation; and the availability (or absence) of means in that litigation, including 
discovery, to obtain the information in question. See id. § 16.22(d). 
The U.S. Attorney will reach a determination regarding your request in light of the 
considerations codified at 28 C.F.R. §§ 16.24, 16.25, and 16.26. Such considerations include, 
inter alia, "[w]hether such disclosure is appropriate under the rules of procedure governing the 
case or matter in which the demand arose," 28 C.F.R. § 16.26(a)(1), and "[w]hether disclosure is 
appropriate under the relevant substantive law concerning privilege," including law enforcement 
privilege. 28 C.F.R. § 16.26(a)(2). Disclosure will not be made when, inter alia, "[d]isclosure 
would violate a statute ... or a rule of procedure, such as the grand jury secrecy rule," 28 U.S.C. 
§ 16.26(b)(1), "[d]isclosure would reveal a confidential source or informant," 28 U.S.C. § 
16.26(b)(4), or "[d]isclosure would reveal investigative records compiled for law enforcement 
purposes, and would interfere with enforcement proceedings or disclose investigative 
techniques," 28 U.S.C. § 16.26(b)(5). Applying these considerations, the Department will make 
appropriate disclosures when warranted. See 28 C.F.R. § 16.26(c).

My understanding is that you may intend to make a formal written request pursuant to the 
above-described regulations. If you choose to submit a written request, please send it directly to 
me. We will act upon an application made pursuant to the Department's regulations. 
Please contact me once you have had a chance to review this letter if you would like to 
discuss the issues herein further. 
Sincerely, 
GEOFFREY S. BERMAN 
United States Attorney for the

tested closer to flying — given the lag in receiving results, we think tomorrow makes the most sense.

Thank you very much for letting us know. We want to make sure your client is as comfortable as possible. It would be 
very useful to our investigation to have more members of our team present for the interviews, but we will of course 
defer to her comfort level. Let's discuss on our call tomorrow and make a final plan for the interviews then. 
The process on our end does not require that we be tested before we depart. 
and I are asymptomatic, have never 
been symptomatic, and have not come into contact with anyone who was symptomatic or a known carrier, so we have 
not been tested. That said, if you/your client would like us to get tested before we leave the U.S., there is a clinic near 
our office that has been able to provide results within a day or two, so we could go there to get tested this week.

Hi 
I spoke to my client over the weekend. I suspect you will get rather more out of her if the number is kept to 2. I think otherwise she 
may be overwhelmed. 
As part of the process at your end will you be taking tests before leaving the US?

Thanks very much, Jill. 
We are obtaining a waiver of the quarantine requirement from the UK government so that we will not be required to 
isolate. If your client is not comfortable with four of us attending, we will of course defer to her preference and have a 
smaller number travel to the UK. Please let us know what she prefers. 
Meeting at your office works for us, thank you. We do not yet know whether the Met Police will need to be in the 
building, but we will let you know as soon as we learn those details. 
Is there a good time on Monday or Tuesday of next week when we might schedule a call?

Many thanks EM, 
I will need to check with my client re 4 members of your party attending. Are you not having to isolate? 
I can organise meeting rooms at my office. 
I am happy to have a call next week to finalise matters. 
Could you confirm if the Met police will also need to be in the building?

Thanks, Jill. A few follow-up questions for you: 
First, we are obtaining clearance for four members of our team to travel to London. Those would be M, 
myself, FBI 
Special Agent 
and FBI Task Force Office 
. All four of us were on the video call with your client 
the other day, so she has seen our faces. Please let us know if she is not comfortable with that group, so that we can 
plan accordingly. 
Second, would you like to meet at your offices, or would you like us to look into other arrangements? 
Third, would you be available for a call next week in preparation for our trip? 
Best, 
Assistant United States Attorney 
Southern District of New York

Hi Jill, 
Thanks very much. Let's block off those dates for now and plan to meet then, if that's okay, and we will let you know if 
for some reason those dates are not approved or if that's an issue.

Hi Jill, 
Thanks for letting us know. Do you think you'll be able to let us know today about the dates we've proposed? 
Apologies for pestering, but we can't move forward with travel arrangements without them, and the process we're 
initiating requires a considerable amount of lead time before traveling once we start it.

Hi Jill, 
With apologies for pressing, I wanted to follow up on these dates. As it turns out, we'll need proposed dates 
before we can move any further in the approval process. If you could please let us know whether these dates 
work for you as soon as you can, we'd be very grateful.

Hi Jill, 
Thanks very much for taking the time to (virtually) meet with us last week, we very much appreciated the chance 
to speak with your client. We have been working on seeking approvals for a potential meeting with your client in 
EFTA00026590
--- PAGE 6 ---
London in the coming weeks. Although we won't know whether the meeting is ultimately approved until we 
complete the process, we are working on the issue in the hopes of making this possible. 
It would be very helpful to us in the approval process to be able to propose specific dates for a meeting. We 
would suggest that we set aside three days for successive meetings, if that works. Would you and your client be 
available for meetings on October 14th, 15th, and 16th? Alternatively, we would propose the 20th, 21st, and 22nd. 
If you could please let us know your availability, we'd very much appreciate it, and we'll keep you updated when 
we have more information. 
Thanks very much,

Hi 
I rather assumed that you were not able to travel given the inherent difficulties with that and how you would be able to 
meet with people in the UK without having to self-isolate first. 
Let me know when is good for you for a video conference call.

Jill, 
Thanks very much for reaching out. We would be glad to schedule a videoconference with your client to discuss 
her questions and concerns. Are there particular dates and times that would work best for you and your client? 
We are in the process of looking into the current rules on travel for government employees, and will let you know 
as soon as we have more information. Our team is willing to travel if we are permitted to, but we're not yet 
certain whether that is possible. 
Thank you,

Jill, 
We're very gratified to hear that your client is willing to speak with us, and we would be happy to answer her 
questions as best we can. 
In terms of logistics, I recently moved to a new position within our office and so the current team has been 
updated — the investigation is now being handled by 
and 
whom you've spoken with previously, 
as well as new addition 
who also has extensive experience in these types of cases—they're all 
copied here. They'll follow up with you to schedule a time for the discussion, and they can let you know the latest 
status on any anticipated approvals for Government foreign travel (which I believe currently is prohibited for us, 
otherwise we would be happy to travel to meet in person). 
Thank you very much for your continued assistance in connection with our investigation, and I expect 
and 
will be in touch shortly as well. 
thanks again,

Hi IN 
My client would like to speak to you to discuss matters. This would be in the form of her asking how you would manage this. 
She did also ask if you were travelling to the UK at any point so. I said not but if I am wrong please do let me know.

indicate she had read and acknowledged my email. No further responses since that time. 
I am assuming that it is their intention to do nothing -- expecting that your investigation will not proceed. There 
is no question in my mind that Andrew was deeply involved with Epstein and was very friendly with Ghislaine 
Maxwell and likely is in touch with her now believed to be in Israel. 
So, I wish you good luck and perhaps his counsel will reach back to me.

Hey you're both on your flights so wanted to send a brief note that 
mentioned that 
misspoke 
yesterday about the possible identities of individuals on Epstein's phone yesterday — not the person she thought 
it might have been. So no emergency except I didn't want that accidentally incorrect info to go up the chain, and 
can chat more later or tomorrow about it.

A. Public Corruption Unit 
The Public Corruption Unit, consisting of about 20 AUSAs, including two supervisors, had 
a busy year focusing on both traditional corruption offenses and abuses of power by both local and 
national in scope. The Unit charged numerous law enforcement and correctional officers in the 
New York City area with various abuses of power, including an excessive force prosecution 
involving a mentally disturbed homeless victim, and multiple federal correctional officers, 
including one who has since pled guilty to sexually assaulting numerous female inmates under his 
watch. The Unit also brought charges of national significance, including campaign finance and 
related charges against Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, among others; extortion and fraud charges 
against attorney Michael Avenatti, and sex trafficking charges against former financier Jeffrey 
Epstein. 
At the local level, the Unit successfully prosecuted both local and federal officials, 
including a former NYPD Detective who used his position to facilitate a scheme to steal tens of 
thousands of dollars from dozens of New York victims. U.S. v. Bonanno, 18 Cr. 427 (PGG). The 
Unit also brought charges against a siding Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice for obstructing a 
federal investigation into fraud and corruption at the Municipal Credit Unit ("MCU") whose board 
she chaired. U.S. v. Ash, 19 Cr. 780 (LAK). Finally, the Unit brought charges against three federal 
correctional officers at the MCC, one for abusing his position to sexually assault numerous female 
inmates under his watch over a multi-year period, U.S. v. Akparanta, 19 Cr. 363 (LGS), and two 
for falsifying records intended to conceal their failure to conduct routine rounds and checks on the 
night Jeffrey Epstein, then an inmate at the MCC, committed suicide. U.S. v. Noel et aL, 19 Cr. 
830 (AT). 
At the national level, the unit brought campaign finance and related charges against four 
defendants, including Lev Pamas and Igor Fruman, based on their participation in a scheme to 
funnel money to political candidates and committees in the hope of gaining access and influence, 
including with respect to their efforts to cause the removal of the then-U.S. Ambassador to 
Ukraine. US. v. Panics, 19 Cr. 725 (JPO). The unit also successfully prosecuted the operator of 
a fraudulent political action committee ("PAC") for defrauding tens of thousands of victims into 
making what they believed to be political or cause-specific contributions under false pretenses, 
obtaining over $1.5 million in restitution and forfeiture for victims at sentencing. U.S. v. Tierney, 
Cr. 804 (JMF). 
The Unit's work in 2019 extended beyond the traditional realm of public officials. In early 
2019, the Unit brought novel extortion charges against attorney Michael Avenatti for attempting 
to extort tens of millions of dollars from the athletic apparel company, Nike. U.S. v. Avenatti, 19 
Cr. 373 (PGG). Avenatti was also charged in a separate scheme to defraud his former client 
Stephanie Clifford afkla "Stormy Daniels," U.S. v. Avenatti, 19 Cr. 374 (JMF). In July 2019, the 
unit brought sex trafficking charges against the former financier Jeffrey Epstein who over a multi-
year period abused dozens of minor victims in New York, Florida and other locations. U.S. v. 
Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 (RMB). While Epstein committed suicide while awaiting trial, at a unique 
hearing held in connection with the entry of an order of nolle prosequi, dozens of Epstein's victims 
were afforded an opportunity to address the Court and publicly confront their abuser. Finally, in 
2019, the Unit successfully completed its prosecution of three cases stemming from corruption in

the world of college basketball, including trying to verdict bribery charges against two defendants 
for making cash payments to university coaches. U.S v. Evans, 17 Cr. 684 (ER), U.S. v. Person, 
Cr. 683 (LAP).

Do you have a more recent version than the attached (sent on Wednesday)? We were going to expand the FBI thank-you 
sentence to be the following: 
Mr. Berman praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI, and thanked the New York City Police Department and 
Customs and Border Patrol for their assistance in the investigation. 
But defer to you if you have a different preference, and let me know whether you want me to incorporate or if you guys

Not that this is rocket science, but does this work, in the remarks after "... for their dedication and professionalism in 
seeing this investigation through.": 
I also want to thank the New York City Police Department and Customs and Border Patrol for their assistance in the

And in the press release: "Mr. Berman praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI, and thanked the New York

Thank you for reaching out, and we would be happy to schedule a time to speak with you. I expect our schedules may 
be somewhat unpredictable tomorrow; would it work to set a time to talk on Tuesday? We can schedule it for before 
you meet with Ms.= if that's helpful. Or if you'd like to talk sooner, we could schedule a time later today, or check in 
tomorrow about a possible afternoon discussion. Please let us know what you prefer, and we look forward to being in 
touch.

Dear 
It was a pleasure talking to you today. As we discussed, I am authorized to accept service of the subpoena for testimony 
issued to Ms. Maxwell by the Grand Jury, SDNY. I expect that we will need to coordinate a mutually convenient time to 
either appear or proffer, either in advance or in lieu of any testimony. 
I will be in court tomorrow morning and afternoon, so I have a small window to discuss the matter- probably between 
11am and noon and then again at around 4pm my time which is 2 hrs. earlier than the East Coast. My staff will attempt to 
obtain a copy of the Epstein indictment as soon as it is publicly available. In my experience this can sometimes be difficult 
so If it is not an inconvenience perhaps you could email the indictment along with the subpoena and waiver. 
Best Regards,

As I think you all know Nick has been placed in SHU based on an allegation that he was in possession of a cell phone. If 
true, I understand that some appropriate and proportional sanction may be in order. 
Leaving that aside I want to address the conditions in his cell. The toilet is leaking and the floor is wet. As of Wednesday, 
he hasn't received his personal property, including his books. He has been sitting in the cell with literally nothing to read, 
listen to or watch. Can we please make an effort to get him reading material, his radio and the accompanying batteries. 
Most troubling is that he tells me that the legal work he had out when he was removed from the cell has not been returned 
to him. This included documents prepared for him by my office which contained substantial and sensitive work product 
that falls squarely within the attorney client privilege. Nick made notes on some of these documents to prepare for our 
next meeting. When I saw him Wednesday, he had some of his legal paperwork but not the documents he was working 
with when he was taken from the cell. I am very concerned that these documents have been seized by the staff at MCC. 
Can you please take steps to see to that all of this material be returned to him immediately. 
Lastly, I am hoping we can find time early next week to discuss the conditions of Nick's confinement going forward.

As Duty Assistant yesterday, the EDNY received this phone call from a potential witness in the Epstein case. Though 
referred to the FBI, he indicated he only wished to speak to someone from the USAO. Having failed to get someone at the 
SDNY he called here. An investigator from our office witnessed the call and his Memorandum of the call is attached. We 
indicated that we would refer the matter to you and that an investigator from the SDNY might be in contact with him.

Hey! 
I searched Epstein's travel records from 6/1/2019 to 6/27/2019 at noon and attached the record. His last record 
shows an OUTBOUND flight on 6/14/2019 to Paris. 
Search capabilities only show international travel and are limited if he travels to the islands because it is US 
Territory. It is unclear why some OUTBOUND/INFBOUND records show Epstein going to/from the islands 
and others don't but it is likely up to how CBP inputs their information. 
Hope this helps!

I spoke with the Facilities Manager and relayed your message about the toilet. He told me one of his staff 
members would check it out. 
With respect to the books and legal work, your client's property was packed the same day he went to SHU. The 
property was taken to the Lieutenant and then up to SHU. On Wednesday, staff gave your client some legal 
paperwork from his property at his request. However, he told staff there were documents missing that had been 
on his bed. Staff relayed that message to me, so that afternoon, I went to your client's cell on 5 North to see 
what, if anything, had been left behind. There was nothing on his bed or anywhere near his bed. There were 
about fifty paperback books piled on his locker and his cellmate's locker. There was also 
some paperwork laying on the books. I went through the paperwork (not reading it, but scanning it quickly to 
determine if the paperwork belonged to your client or his cellmate). Most of the paperwork had case captions 
so it was easily discernible. I found a few papers that belonged to your client, and I gave those to him. Based 
on my inspection, I don't believe there was any other paperwork in the cell that belonged to your client. 
Shortly after I left, one of the Lieutenants gathered all of the books and put them with the rest of your client's 
property. 
We'll follow up next week to get your client the personal property items to which he is entitled in SHU. 
or I will keep you updated once we get more information on Monday.

Good afternoon, 
As I think you all know Nick has been placed in SHU based on an allegation that he was in possession of a cell phone. If 
true, I understand that some appropriate and proportional sanction may be in order. 
Leaving that aside I want to address the conditions in his cell. The toilet is leaking and the floor is wet. As of 
Wednesday, he hasn't received his personal property, including his books. He has been sitting in the cell with literally 
nothing to read, listen to or watch. Can we please make an effort to get him reading material, his radio and the 
accompanying batteries. 
Most troubling is that he tells me that the legal work he had out when he was removed from the cell has not been 
returned to him. This included documents prepared for him by my office which contained substantial and sensitive work 
product that falls squarely within the attorney client privilege. Nick made notes on some of these documents to prepare 
for our next meeting. When I saw him Wednesday, he had some of his legal paperwork but not the documents he was 
working with when he was taken from the cell. I am very concerned that these documents have been seized by the 
staff at MCC. Can you please take steps to see to that all of this material be returned to him immediately. 
Lastly, I am hoping we can find time early next week to discuss the conditions of Nick's confinement going forward.

Hi guys —this is a long shot, but by any chance do you happen to have a cell phone number for Judge Pitman's deputy? Or 
even an email address? We've been asked to try to tee up the Epstein unsealing for him tomorrow morning—I think we 
could just call him at 9:00 when the court opens, but far more important people than I would like us to try to reach out 
today. We have all the Moses duty info since she's on this weekend, but nothing for Pitman (and he doesn't list any email

Hi all, 
As you may already know, pursuant to the Crime Victims' Rights Act, specifically 18 U.S.C. 3771(a)(4), a crime victim has the 
right to be reasonably heard at certain public proceedings in the district court, including proceedings involving release. 
Accordingly, we wanted to be in touch consistent with our responsibilities and obligations—and your client's rights—under 
that statute, to see whether your client would like to be heard in any fashion, whether through a submission, a 
representation that we can include in our bail submission due Friday, or some other form. Of course no requirement or 
obligation, but we would be happy to discuss it if that would be useful. 
To the extent this information is useful in your consideration, I can say that while I don't want to prejudge the 
Would it make sense to set up a brief call sometime tomorrow, if any of you want to discuss? I should be able to make myself 
available whenever is convenient for you (and likely will be just me, as the remainder of the team will be traveling). 
thank you,

Thank you very much for being in touch, and I write to confirm receipt of your email and to acknowledge your

HIM, 
Along with Mr. Pottinger (admitted in the Southern District of New York) and Mr. Edwards (admitted in 
Florida), I represent various victims of federal sex crimes committed by Jeffrey Epstein. It is my understanding 
that you will be speaking to the court shortly about conditions of his release. My clients request that he be 
detained, as otherwise they will be fearful for their safety. They believe that his continued detention is necessary 
under the CVRA's right to "reasonable protection." They request that you communicate that concern to the judge 
in whatever way you think best, as part of their CVRA right to be heard on a defendant's release. 
My clients are also concerned that Epstein might try to create some sort of "private jail" to secure his release. My 
clients believe that this would violate their CVRA right to be treated with fairness and to be free from harassment 
and abuse. It is unfair to victims of a wealthy defendant, like Epstein, if he is given great freedoms than others 
would in similar circumstances. 
Thank you in advance for communicating these concerns to the judge. My clients very much appreciate your 
efforts to bring Epstein to justice.

Thank you again for speaking with us today in connection with our investigation of Jeffrey Epstein. As we mentioned on 
the phone, we are interested in speaking with your client, and we appreciate her willingness to meet with us. So you have 
the contact info for all of our team, we can all be reached anytime at the emails here or via phone at: 
As we spoke about a few minutes ago, we would be happy to meet with you and your client at our office this Friday, July

Bridge 4/5/6 and l/Z subway stop, or with a few blocks of various Chambers Street stops on other lines. If you've ever 
been to 1 Police Plaza, it's right next door, slightly behind a large red outdoor sculpture. And if you have any issues finding 
the building, you can call me directly - 
When you get to the building, just

Following up on our Brass meeting just now, It's that time of year when we need to do forfeiture funding requests. 
These are basically short write-ups of cases that may involve forfeiture and are also likely to incur significant 
investigative costs (e.g., traveling to Florida a dozen times, hiring a vendor retaining an expert). Could you guys do a 
super quick Epstein write up this afternoon and send it back to me (unfortunately need to get these done today — sorry 
for the short notice)? I've attached a blank form and a go-by (you'll see just how short these can be). 
Also, notwithstanding what the form says, please do NOT email it down to DC — please send it back to me.

Good evening-
You failed to provide any update concerning the whereabouts of Ms. Maxwell's legal mail that I had placed in the legal 
mailbox on 10/2. 
However, on Friday afternoon, I was informed by Ms. Maxwell and Unit Manager 
that the envelope had 
been located and affixed to it 
was a bar-code type sticker, not generated by the MDC, but of the type issued by the U.S. Post Office. 
I had placed the envelope in the legal mailbox. It did not have postage. If, for some questionable reason, it had been 
handled by the U.S . Postal Service 
(which is highly unlikely and, if so, deliberately caused by the MDC), the Post Office would have returned it to my office 
address (at the return address on the envelope), 
not deliver it to the MDC without postage. 
This suggests some type of foul play on the part of the MDC, or at least some type of cover-up. 
I am informed that the Warden is aware of this. Today, I received the envelope from Unit Manager 
Today, Christian Everdell, Esq. and I had a scheduled legal visit with Ms. Maxwell. 
Rather than permitting us to use a somewhat larger room, we were required to use a room for two. 
This completely defeated the purpose of COVID protective measures. The plastic partition did not shield 
Mr. Everdell and there was little or no table surface for him to use. The room was unnecessarily cramped 
when a larger room was available. My request to use a larger room was denied. The officer claimed the team could not 
position the camera 
to focus on the larger room. This response was bogus. I requested to see the Warden, but that request was never 
honored. 
Further, defense counsel at large have heard about the current electricity issues affecting water, toilet flushing, and meals. 
Ms. Maxwell received a bologna sandwich despite being on no-flesh (vegetarian) diet. 
This is yet another blunder on the part of the MDC which needs to be immediately corrected. 
I will not waste my energy requesting a response because even if forthcoming it will likely be insufficient. 
These matters will be brought to the Court's attention, so you can start preparing excuses for consideration by Judge 
Nathan. 
Enjoy your holiday.

As of this writing, Ms. Maxwell has not received legal mail which I 
personally placed in the 
East Building legal mailbox on Saturday, October 2. On that same day, 
in that same mailbox, 
I deposited legal mail for a client housed in the west building. That 
client confirmed that he received his legal mail. 
Ms. Maxwell has not. 
Please explain why delivery of Ms. Maxwell's mail has been delayed. 
Time is of the essence. Her trial begins on November 29th. 
Every delay caused by the MDC interferes with her ability to prepare 
for trial. 
Your prompt response is requested. 
Thank you-
Bobbi

Subject: Law360; Dershowitz Can Pursue Bid To DQ Boles Schiller In Sex Case 
Date: Wed, 19 Jun 2019 20:29:48 +0000 
Importance: Normal 
Dershowitz Can Pursue Bid To DQ Boies Schiller In 
Sex Case 
By Andrew Strickler 
Share us on: By Andrew Strickler 
Law360 (June 18, 2019, 6:13 PM EDT) -- The New York federal judge who initially refused to hear Alan Dershowitz's 
request to disqualify Boies Schiller Flexner LLP from representing a woman accusing the prominent attorney and retired 
Harvard Law School professor of sexually molesting her said on Monday that she would consider it. 
In a brief order, U.S. District Judge Loretta A. Preska allowed Dershowitz's motion to be reinstated and said he could file a 
28-page memo on his request. 
The order comes a week after Judge Preska said she was removing the motion because Dershowitz didn't request a 
premotion conference before the filing in violation of a court rule. 
Dershowitz's accuser, 
has alleged that convicted billionaire sex offender Jeffrey Epstein "lent her out for 
sex" to Dershowitz and that Dershowitz played a role as Epstein's attorney and friend in a human trafficking  scheme 
during the late 1990s and early 2000s involving dozens of underage girls. 
In a July 7 motion, Dershowitz argued that Boies Schiller shouldn't be allowed to continue to represent 
because 
the firm has "severe" conflicts in the case. 
Those stem from an offer made in 2015 by Boies Schiller partner Carlos Sires to represent Dershowitz after 
alleged 
in a separate Crime Victims Rights Act suit focused on Epstein's deal with prosecutors that she had sex with ers owitz 
and others. 
Dershowitz said in his motion he didn't learn Boies Schiller was representing his accuser in the current case until after he 
shared with Sires a "highly confidential" memo spelling out his legal strategy in the case. The next day, Sires informed 
Dershowitz that a client conflict was going to prevent him from representing Dershowitz. 
Last week, Boies Schiller submitted a letter to the court stating that Dershowitz hadn't complied with the premotion 
conference rule; Judge Preska agreed and ordered his filing "marked off the calendar." 
"Professor Dershowitz is gratified that the court will consider the motion on its merits," said Dershowitz counsel Arthur L. 
Aidala and Imran H. Ansari in a statement Tuesday. 
Giuffre counsel Joshua Schiller of Boies Schiller submitted a letter to Judge Preska on Monday urging her to deny the 
disqualification request without further briefing. 
Dershowitz filed the "tactical" motion months into the suit despite having known for some five years that the firm 
EFTA00026703
--- PAGE 2 ---
represents 
Schiller said. Moreover, Dershowitz's brief contact with Sires never resulted in the formation of an 
attorney-clien re ationship. 
"Even though he knew that BSF's conflict check had not been completed, Dershowitz copied Mr. Sires into a group e-mail 
attaching a memorandum, which Dershowitz now claims was confidential," Schiller wrote, adding that the memo was 
addressed to Dershowitz's "friends" and contained no confidential information. 
"This is an attempt to manufacture a conflict and delay the case and prevent our client from working with the counsel 
she's worked with for five years," Schiller told Law360. 
Dershowitz's ties to the Epstein scandal were back in the news after a February ruling by U.S. District Judge Kenneth A. 
Marra, who found current Labor Secretary Alex Acosta had been among several prosecutors who mishandled a decade-
old sex crime case against Epstein when they signed a nonprosecution agreement with Epstein without notifying his 
victims. 
s represented by Joshua Schiller and Sigrid McCawley of Boies Schiller Flexner LLP. 
Dershowitz is represented by Imran H. Ansari and Arthur L. Aidala of Aidala Bertuna & Kamins PC. 
The case is Giuffre v. Dershowitz, case number 1:19-cv-03377 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New 
York.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
United States of America, 
Ghislaine Maxwell, 
Defendant. 
USDC SDNY 
DOCUMENT 
ELECTRONICALLY FILED 
DOC 0: 
DATE FILED: 9/2/20 
20-CR-330 (MN) 
MEMORANDUM 
OPINION AND ORDER 
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
On August 17, 2020, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell filed a sealed letter motion seeking 
an Order modifying the protective order in this case.' Specifically, she sought a Court order 
allowing her to file under seal in certain civil cases ("Civil Cases") materials ("Documents") that 
she received in discovery from the Government in this case. She also sought permission to 
I This Order will not refer to any redacted or otherwise confidential information, and as a result it will not be sealed. 
The Court will adopt the redactions to Defendant's August 17, 2020 letter motion that the Government proposed on 
August 21, 2020, and it will enter that version into the public docket. The Court's decision to adopt the 
Government's proposed redactions is guided by the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. 
Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Under this test, the Court must: (i) determine whether the 
documents in question are "judicial documents;" (ii) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to 
the materials; and (iii) balance competing considerations against the presumption of access. Id. at 119-20. "Such 
countervailing factors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency' 
and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.'" Id. at 120 (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 
1048 (2d Cir.1995) ("Amodeo Ii")). The Government's proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds 
that the defendant's letter motion is "relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial 
process," thereby qualifying as a "judicial document" for purposes of the first element of the Lugosch test. United 
States v. Amodeo ("Amodeo I"), 44 F.3d 141, 145 (2d Cir. 1995). Second, the Court assumes that the common law 
presumption of access attaches, thereby satisfying the second element. But in balancing competing considerations 
against the presumption of access, the Court finds that the arguments the Government has put forth—including, 
most notably, the threat that public disclosure of the redacted sections would interfere with an ongoing grand jury 
investigation—favor the Government's proposed narrowly tailored redactions. 
In light of this ruling, the parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer with respect to proposed redactions to 
the Defendant's reply letter, dated August 24, 2020 and the Defendant's August 24, 2020 letter addressing her 
proposed redactions to the Defendant's August 17, 2020 letter motion. The parties are further ORDERED to submit 
their proposed redactions no later than September 4, 2020; if the parties cannot agree on their proposed redactions, 
they shall submit a joint letter to the Court explaining the nature of their dispute.

reference, but not file, other discovery material that the Government produced in this case. For 
the reasons that follow, Defendant's requests are DENIED. 
Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16(d)(1), a Court may enter a protective order 
only after it finds that good cause exists. Within this framework, the Federal Rules of Criminal 
Procedure leave it to the discretion of the Court to determine whether modification of an existing 
protective order is warranted.2 To make that decision, the Court takes into account all relevant 
factors, including the parties' reliance on the protective order and whether the moving party has 
sufficiently substantiated a request to deviate from the status quo in the instant matter. 
On July 30, 2020, this Court entered a protective order in this case, having determined 
that good cause existed. Dkt. No. 36. The parties agreed that a protective order was warranted. 
See Dkt. No. 35 at 1 ("The parties have met and conferred, resolving nearly all the issues relating 
to the proposed protective order."). The Defendant's Proposed Protective Order included a 
provision that stated that all discovery produced by the Government "[s]hall be used by the 
Defendant or her Defense Counsel solely for purposes of the defense of this criminal action, and 
not for any civil proceeding or any purpose other than the defense of this action." Dkt. No. 29, 
Ex. A ¶ 1(a). That language was included in the Court's July 30, 2020 protective order. See Dkt. 
No. 36 ¶¶ 1(a), 10(a), 14(a). Shortly thereafter, the Government began to produce discovery. 
Upon receipt of some of the discovery, the Defendant filed the instant request, which 
seeks modification of the protective order in order to use documents produced in the criminal 
In the civil context, there is a "strong presumption against the modification of a protective order." In re Teligent, 
Inc., 640 F.3d 53, 59 (2d Cir. 2011) (citation omitted). Courts in the Second Circuit have applied the standard for 
modification of protective orders in the civil context to the criminal context. See, e.g., United States v. Calderon, 
No. 3:15-CR-25 (JCR), 2017 WL 6453344, at •2 (D. Conn. Dec. I, 2017) (applying the civil standard for the 
modification of a protective order in a criminal case); United States v. Kerik, No. 07-CR-1027 (LAP), 2014 WL 
12710346 at *I (S.D.N.Y. July 23, 2014) (same). See also United States v. Morales, 807 F.3d 717, 723 (5th Cir. 
2015) (applying the standard for "good cause" in the civil context when evaluating whether to modify a protective 
order entered in a criminal case); United States v. Wecht, 484 F.3d 194, 211 (3rd Cir. 2007) (same).

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 51 Filed 09/02/20 Page 3 of 5 
case in other civil proceedings. She bases her request on the premise that disclosure of the 
Documents to the relevant judicial officers is allegedly necessary to ensure the fair adjudication 
of issues being litigated in those civil matters. But after fourteen single-spaced pages of heated 
rhetoric, the Defendant proffers no more than vague, speculative, and conclusory assertions as to 
why that is the case. She provides no coherent explanation of what argument she intends to 
make before those courts that requires the presentation of the materials received in discovery in 
this criminal matter under the existing terms of the protective order in this case. And she 
furnishes no substantive explanation regarding the relevance of the Documents to decisions to be 
made in those matters, let alone any explanation of why modifying the protective order in order 
to allow such disclosure is necessary to ensure the fair adjudication of those matters. In sum, the 
arguments the Defendant presents to the Court plainly fail to establish good cause. The 
Defendant's request is DENIED on this basis. 
Indeed, good cause for the requested modification of the protective order is further 
lacking because, as far as this Court can discern, the facts she is interested in conveying to the 
judicial decisionmakers in the Civil Cases are already publicly available, including in the 
Government's docketed letter on this issue. See Dkt. No. 46. In the opening paragraph of her 
reply letter dated August 24, 2020, the Defendant states that she is essentially seeking to disclose 
under seal to certain judicial officers the following factual information: 
I. Grand jury subpoenas were issued to an entity ("Recipient") after the Government 
opened a grand jury investigation into Jeffrey Epstein and his possible co-
conspirators; 
2. The Recipient concluded that it could not turn over materials responsive to the grand 
jury subpoena absent a modification of the civil protective orders in the civil cases; 
EFTA00026707
--- PAGE 4 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 51 Filed 09/02/20 Page 4 of 5 
3. In February 2019, the Government, ex parte and under seal, sought modification of 
those civil protective orders so as to permit compliance with the criminal grand jury 
subpoenas; 
4. In April 2019, one court ("Court-1") permitted the modification and, subsequently, 
another court ("Court-2") did not; 
5. That as a result of the modification of the civil protective order by Court-1, the 
Recipient turned over to the Government certain materials that had been covered by 
the protective order; and 
6. That the Defendant learned of this information (sealed by other courts) as a result of 
Rule 16 discovery in this criminal matter. 
With the exception of identifying the relevant judicial decision makers and specific civil 
matters, all of the information listed above is available in the public record, including in the letter 
filed on the public docket by the Government on this issue. See Dkt. No. 46. Although this 
Court remains in the dark as to why this information will be relevant to those courts, so that 
those courts can make their own determination, to the extent it would otherwise be prohibited by 
the protective order in this matter, the Court hereby permits the defendant to provide to the 
relevant courts under seal the above information, including the information identifying the 
relevant judicial decision makers and civil matters. 
In addition, the Government has indicated that "there is no impediment to counsel 
making sealed applications to Court-1 and Court-2, respectively, to unseal the relevant 
materials." Dkt. No. 46 at 3 n.5. In her reply, the Defendant asserts that she is amenable to such 
a solution if the Court agrees with the Government that doing so would not contravene the 
protective order in this case. To the extent it would otherwise be prohibited by the protective

order in this matter, the Defendant may make unsealing applications to those Courts if she 
wishes. 
SO ORDERED.

it could just be that staff did not notify me a package arrived. Depending on the carrier, it could be in the warehouse or

Jeffrey Epstein used $46 
million charitable donation to 
keep alive his ties with 
billionaire Les Wexner

Brian Schwartz/iv  SCHWARTZFICNBC 
• 
Accused child molester Jeff Epstein in 2008 essentially bankrolled one of Les Wexner's first nonprofit 
foundations with a contribution of more than $40 million in stock and other assets. 
• 
Despite the massive donation, the Wexners tried to distance themselves from Epstein. 
• 
While Wexner appeared to shun Epstein after his first arrest in Florida, many politicians and companies 
have continued to accept contributions from him or his organizations. 
EFTA00026723
--- PAGE 2 ---
Before hedge fund manager Jeffrey Epstein went to jail in Florida more than a decade ago, 
billionaire L Brands founder and Chairman Les Wexner was trying to distance himself from the 
accused child molester. 
That didn't stop Epstein in 2008 from essentially bankrolling one of Wexner's first nonprofit 
foundations with a contribution of more than $40 million in stock and other assets. The 
transactions were received only months before Epstein was sentenced to a term in a Palm Beach 
County jail on a charge of soliciting an underage prostitute. 
Epstein is back in the news after his arrest Saturday on an indictment filed by the U.S. Attorney's 
Office for the Southern District of New York which charged him with trafficking  dozens of 
underage girls. 
Some of the alleged crimes took  place in a New York townhouse once owned by Wexner. He is 
currently being held without bail. Wexner was known to be one of the money manager's few 
clients. 
The case has reignited interest in the politically connected businessman who was once friendly 
with President Donald Trump and ex-President Bill Clinton. it and has prompted some who 
received money from him to wash their hands of it. On Wednesday Sen. Chuck Schumer, D.-
N.Y., said he would donate $7,000 in contributions from Epstein to charity. Stacey Plaskett, 
Democratic U.S. Virgin Islands congresswoman,  has also decided to give her Epstein
contributions to two different charities. 
Epstein provided initial financing to Wexner's YLK Charitable Fund more than 10 years ago, 
even as Wexner and his wife started to break away from the financier after the initial accusations 
surfaced, according to someone in their inner circle. 
"They are both very prominent in Columbus [Ohio]" the person told CNBC on Wednesday. "It's 
just unseemly that they would associate with someone who first was accused of things that made 
them extremely uncomfortable and then he eventually pleaded guilty to those offenses," the 
person said. 
When asked about Epstein's behemoth donations to the foundation before going to jail, this 
person refused to comment. It is unclear whether the Wexners will give the money away. 
Just before Epstein began a 13-month jail term, his firm, the Financial Trust Co., based in the 
U.S. Virgin Islands, and his own nonprofit, The C.O.U.Q. Foundation, contributed a combined 
$46 million plus to YLK , according  to a 2008 990 disclosure form. Wexner became YLK's 
director in 2010 and his wife Abigail was president in 2008. 
It was the only contribution the Wexners received that year. In 2009 and 2010, YLK did not 
receive a single donation. 
Epstein's C.O.U.Q. also gave $14 million to YLK in 2007, a filing shows. 
Epstein first financed the Wexner nonprofit with $33 million worth of Applestock and $5.4 
million in shares of Bear Stearns Asset Backed-Securities Overseas Ltd., a third-party company 
affiliated with the now-defunct bank Bear Stearns. Outside of contributions to The Columbus 
EFTA00026724
--- PAGE 3 ---
Foundation, the documents show YLK did not make any other donations from 2007 through 
2010. 
The assets Epstein gave the Wexners' nonprofit helped it have at least $10 million in short-term 
capital gains over the course of 2009 and 2010 as the value of some of the stocks and assets 
soared. Apple's stock is now trading at just over $200. 
In late 2010, YLK announced it would transfer all of its assets to The Wexner Family Charitable 
Fund, which in 2017 reported total assets worth $208 million in fair market value,  records 
show. Since 2010 the Wexner fund has been actively contributing to a variety of causes. 
Epstein, according to a recent report by Forbes, served in the 1990s as a trustee of a separate
group: The Wexner Foundation. 
A spokeswoman for Wexner only noted he had "severed ties" with Epstein over a decade ago and 
declined to comment further. 
A member of Epstein's firm hung up after CNBC identified itself and did not return a later 
message requesting comment. Attorney's for Epstein also did not return requests for comment. 
Calls to the Wexner Foundation, where The Wexner Family Charitable Fund is *located*, along 
with an email to Les Wexner's attorney, were not returned. The treasurer of Epstein's current 
nonprofit, Gratitude America Ltd., did not return a request for comment. 
Before his massive stock distribution to the Wexner group, Epstein told The New York Times that a 
Manhattan mansion Wexner bought for $13.2 million was now his. "Les never spent more than two 
months there," Epstein told the Times in 1996. The City's Department of Finance values the 
property at $56 million and Epstein has been accused by prosecutors of engaging in sexual acts with 
underage girls from 2002 to 2005 in this same New York home. 
In an interview with Vanity Fair in 2003, Wexner praised Epstein for his understanding of politics 
and financial markets, giving a glimpse into why he decided to become one of his clients. 
"I think we both possess the skill of seeing patterns," Wexner said. "But Jeffrey sees patterns in 
politics and financial markets, and I see patterns in lifestyle and fashion trends. My skills are not in 
investment strategy, and, as everyone who knows Jeffrey knows, his are not in fashion and design. 
We frequently discuss world trends as each of us sees them." 
While Wexner appeared to move way from Epstein after his initial arrest, many politicians and 
companies have continued to accept contributions from him or his organizations. 
Gratitude America in 2016 gave $15,000 to the New York-based all-girls school The Hewitt School 
and the next year, wrote a $30,000 check to The O'Gorman Garden, a Harlem preschool, among 
other contributions. 
During the 2016 and 2018 election cycles, Epstein gave Plaskett a total of three $2,700 checks to 
help fund her campaigns for Congress. After initially signalling she wouldn't give back the money, a 
day later she reversed course and gave the contributions to two charities. 
EFTA00026725

Before his initial conviction, Epstein also had ties to Clinton and his family's group, the Clinton 
Foundation. Epstein contributed to Clinton's presidential campaign and through his C.O.U.Q. 
nonprofit in 2006 reportedly sent $25,000 to the foundation. A spokesman for Clinton has said the 
former president has not spoken with Epstein for over a decade and has no knowledge of his alleged 
crimes. 
It's unclear if either Clinton, the New York schools or the foundation will return or give away these 
contributions. They all did not return requests for comment.

United States Magistrate Judge

New York, NY 10007-1312 
Re: 
Letter Motion to Stay Proceedings 
20-cv-484 (JGK-DCF), Jane Doe v. Darren K. Indyke, et aL 
Dear Judge Freeman: 
On behalf of defendant Ghislaine Maxwell, I write to Move to Stay 
proceedings in this matter until the conclusion of her pending criminal case. "[T]he 
power to stay proceedings is incidental to the power inherent in every court to control 
the disposition of the causes on its docket with economy of time and effort for itself, 
for counsel, and for litigants." Louis Vuitton Malletier S.A. v. LY USA, Inc., 676 F.3d 
83, 96 (2d Cir. 2012) (citations omitted). 
The interests of the courts, the public, the other parties and Ms. Maxwell all 
will best be served by a stay of this civil case. A stay will allow Ms. Maxwell to 
vigorously contest her criminal charges, and there is little chance that any evidence 
will be lost in the interim given the age of the accusations in this case. Plaintiff 
refuses to state whether she intends to pursue a civil remedy in the Epstein Claims 
Resolution Program, yet a stay also would permit her the opportunity to do so. She is 
inexplicably the only of the numerous Epstein plaintiffs in this Court to not agree to 
such a stay. While Plaintiff's counsel refuses to state whether his client is one of the 
three accusers in the currently-pending Maxwell Indictment, there exists substantial 
overlap in the facts and issues between this civil complaint and the Indictment. The 
burden on Ms. Maxwell to proceed forward in a civil case relating to quarter-century 
old events while detained at the MDC cannot be overstated in light of the conditions 
of her detention, to include no access to email, no access to her files, no access to her 
records from the relevant time period, no presence in depositions, and most 
importantly, insufficient access to her counsel. We respectfully request that this 
Court enter a stay.

Hon. Debra Freeman

Procedural Background 
On May 13, 2020, Ms. Maxwell wrote to this Court in connection with a 
separate pending civil suit, requesting a stay of discovery as to her, based on the U.S. 
Attorney's Office's public proclamation of an "ongoing" criminal investigation into 
alleged Jeffrey Epstein co-conspirators and on that plaintiff's stated intent to 
participate in the Voluntary Claims Resolution Program in the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
v. Indyke, 19-cv-10475-LGS-DCF, Doc. # 68 (May 13, 2020). Plaintiff 
opposed the request; her counsel 
claimed that Ms. 
Maxwell had not provided sufficient information about the ongoing criminal 
investigation and had refused to answer whether she herself is a target of such 
investigation. Id. at Doc. # 72 at 2. On May 22, after oral argument, this Court 
granted Ms. Maxwell's request in part, ordering that she not be required to answer 
interrogatories or give deposition testimony absent further order of the Court. Id., 
Doc. # 77. A short time later, on June 19, 2020, plaintiff 
_ 
reversed 
course and requested a stay of the proceedings, which was granted by this Court. Id. 
at Doc. # 84, 85. 
In this case, Jane Doe commenced her anonymous civil action on January 17, 
2020. The Court approved alternative service on Ms. Maxwell on June 15. (Doc. 
# 45). On June 29, 2020, before she had the opportunity to answer, Ms. Maxwell was 
indicted by a grand jury. That criminal case is now pending before Judge Nathan, 
United States v. Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN). The July 8 Superseding Indictment is 
attached as Exhibit A ("Indictment"). Notably, the Indictment quotes directly from 
Ms. Maxwell's sealed civil deposition testimony in 
v. Maxwell, 15-cv-7433. 
On July 14, Ms. Maxwell was arraigned and pled not guilty. At the detention 
hearing, plaintiff 
spoke on the public record against Ms. Maxwell. Two 
other accusers provided their CVRA positions anonymously. Judge Nathan ordered 
Ms. Maxwell detained, and she currently is housed at the Metropolitan Detention 
Center in Brooklyn. A jury trial is scheduled to begin July 12, 2021. 
The U.S. Attorney's Office has refused to identify to Ms. Maxwell, even 
under seal or subject to the protective order, the accusers mentioned in the Indictment 
until it produces 3500 material shortly before trial. See 20 Cr. 330 (MN), Doc. # 40-
42. When asked on July 17, Plaintiff's counsel in this case refused to state whether 
his client is one of the three accusers described in the Indictment. 
Plaintiff's counsel has stated that his client is considering whether to 
participate in the Voluntary Claims Resolution Program but has not yet submitted 
such a claim.

Legal Standard 
"[T]he power to stay proceedings is incidental to the power inherent in every 
court to control the disposition of the causes on its docket with economy of time and 
effort for itself, for counsel, and for litigants." Louis Vuitton Malletier S.A. v. LY 
USA, Inc., 676 F.3d 83, 96 (2d Cir. 2012) (citations omitted). Courts in this District 
balance the following six factors when considering whether to stay a civil matter: 
(1) the extent to which the issues in the criminal case overlap with those presented in 
the civil case; (2) the status of the case, including whether the defendants have been 
indicted; (3) the private interests of the plaintiffs in proceeding expeditiously weighed 
against the prejudice to plaintiffs caused by the delay; (4) the private interests of and 
burden on the defendants; (5) the interests of the courts; and (6) the public interest. Id. 
at 99. 
ARGUMENT 
Application of the six factors leads to the firm conclusion that this civil matter 
should be stayed. 
(1) 
Overlap of issues in the criminal and civil matters: A comparison of 
the Indictment and the Complaint reveals the common nature of the allegations and 
issues in both cases. Plaintiff Jane Doe contends she met Ms. Maxwell in the summer 
of 1994 and that she was "groomed" by Ms. Maxwell through movie and shopping 
excursions. Cplt 9191 13-15. The Indictment likewise alleges that Ms. Maxwell spent 
time building friendships with minor victims by, for example, taking minor victims to 
the movies or shopping," including Minor Victim 1 whom she purportedly met in 
1994. Ex. A at 1 4(a). Jane Doe alleges that Epstein paid for her educational 
opportunities and was facilitated by Ms. Maxwell. Cplt. 1 16. The Indictment makes 
the same claim. Ex. A at 1 4(d). The allegations contained in the Indictment at 17(a) 
are very similar in time frame and content to those in the Complaint.' 
Given the overlapping time frame, allegations and nature of the cases, the 
witnesses and evidence are highly likely to be overlapping, if not identical, in both 
this case and the criminal matter. 
' The press recently has speculated as much. See, e.g., Kate Briquelet, "Epstein 
Victim Claims He Showed Her Off to Trump When She Was 14," The Daily Beast (Aug. 18, 
2020) (comparing Doe's allegations in the Complaint to the Indictment: "The accusations are 
similar to those in Maxwell's indictment. In 1994, the document says, Maxwell and Epstein 
`attempted to befriend Minor Victim-1, taking her to the movies and on shopping trips' and 
asking the girl "about school, her classes, her family, and other aspects of her life.' They 
arranged for the victim to travel to New York and Florida, where she was abused by Epstein 
and Maxwell, prosecutors say.") (https://www.thedailybeast.com/epstein-victim-claims-he-
showed-her-off-to-trump-at-mar-a-lago-when-she-was-14).

Hon. Debra Freeman 
August 19, 2020 
Page 4 
(2) 
Status of the case, including whether the defendants have been 
indicted. "Whether the defendant has been indicted has been described as `the most 
important factor' to be considered in the balance of factors. . .'" Maldanado v. City of 
New York, Case No. 17-cv-6618 (MN), 2018 WL 2561026, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. June I, 
2018) (citations omitted). "[O]nce an indictment has been issued, 'the likelihood that 
a defendant may make incriminating statements is greatest,' and 'the prejudice to the 
plaintiffs in the civil case is reduced since the criminal case will likely be quickly 
resolved due to Speedy Trial Act considerations.' Id. (quoting Trs. of the Plumbers 
and Pipefitters Nat'l Pension Fund, 886 F. Supp. at 1139). "The weight of authority 
in this Circuit indicates that courts will stay a civil proceeding when the criminal 
investigation has ripened into an indictment." In re Par Phan', Inc., 133 F.R.D. 12, 
(S.D.N.Y.1990). 
Ms. Maxwell has been indicted, detained, arraigned and scheduled for trial. 
Should this case not be stayed, Ms. Maxwell will naturally be forced to decide 
whether to assert the Fifth Amendment protections afforded her by the U.S. 
Constitution or risk facing an adverse inference against her in this case. She also will 
have to make such a choice in response to written discovery requests. The burdens on 
an indicted defendant have led numerous courts in this Circuit and elsewhere to 
impose a stay on overlapping civil cases during the pendency of a criminal case. See, 
e.g., Nesbitt v. Berner, 18-CV-00699 (VLB), 2018 WL 5619716 (D. Conn. Oct. 30, 
2018) (granting stay of federal Trafficking Victims Protection Act civil after 
defendant was charged in state court with patronizing a minor prostitute victim of 
trafficking); Stamile v. County of Nassau, No. CV 10-2632(SJF)(AKT), 2011 WL 
1754125, at *7 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 31, 2011) (granting stay of related civil proceedings 
following indictment of defendant accused of sexually touching inmates in jail). 
(3) 
Private interests of the plaintiffs in proceeding expeditiously weighed 
against the prejudice to plaintiffs caused by the delay. Plaintiff has brought this civil 
case a full 26 years after she claims the wrongdoing occurred. Having waited more 
than a quarter of century to pursue her claims, any evidence that has been lost to the 
passage of time is unlikely to have been in existence even at the inception of 
Plaintiff's case. In other words, there is hardly much harm in waiting an additional 
matter of months to litigate claims as stale as those presented here. Moreover, the 
Epstein Voluntary Claims Resolution Program, the basis for the stays for each of the 
other pending actions concerning Mr. Epstein and the one other concerning Ms. 
Maxwell, requires participation by, at least, March 2021. During the pendency of the 
requested stay, Plaintiff will have a full opportunity to participate in that program 
obviating the need for this case to proceed at all. 
(4) 
Private int 
d burden on the defendant. "A stay can protect a 
defendant from making a 
hoice' of choosing to be prejudiced in the civil 
litigation if the defendant asserts is ifth Amendment privilege, or from being 
EFTA00026738
--- PAGE 5 ---
Case 1:20-cv-00484-JGK-DCF Document 69 Filed 08/19/20 Page 5 of 6 
Hon. Debra Freeman 
August 19, 2020 
Page 5 
prejudiced in the criminal proceeding if he or she waives that privilege in the civil 
litigation." Louis Vuitton, 676 F.3d at 97. Furthermore: 
The Sixth Amendment provides that '[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the 
accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial...." U.S. Const. 
Amend. VI. Civil discovery is intrusive and time consuming. Engaging in 
civil discovery, including depositions and interrogatory compliance, may 
inhibit [Ms. Maxwell's] ability to zealously defend this civil case while at the 
same time preserving [her] right t 
nst the criminal charges. To the 
extent [s]he is forced to make the 
hoice" between protecting [her] 
financial interests by defending [herse 
m t is civil action and [her] penal 
interests by defending [herself] in the criminal charges, his Sixth Amendment 
rights to a fair and speedy trial will be abridged if not denied. 
Nesbitt, 2018 WL 5619716 at *6. Finally, the burden on Ms. Maxwell to proceed 
forward in a civil case while detained in the MDC without access to her files or 
potential witnesses, cannot be overstated. Defending against conduct that purportedly 
occurred decades ago requires an extraordinary degree of forensic sleuthing through 
one's records, memories, witnesses, and events. Her counsel cannot meet with her in 
person at all, and she cannot participate in any depositions. She currently has no 
access to email, so cannot review drafts, discovery or pleadings, without waiting for 
the mail, the opportunity to review and mark-up, and then mailing the pleadings back. 
The burden for actively litigating this civil case from custody, particularly given the 
restrictions imposed by the Covid-era, is extraordinary and cannot possibly result in 
fair proceedings in this case. 
(5) 
Interests of the court: "As many courts in similar circumstances have 
noted, 'Mk Criminal Case will resolve issues of fact common to the civil case and 
may reduce the number of issues to be decided in subsequent proceedings in this 
case.'" SEC v. Abraaj Invest. Mgmt. Ltd., 19-CV-3244 (AJN), 2019 WL 6498282 
(S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3, 2019) (collecting cases); see also Shkreli, 2016 WL 1122029, at *6 
("A stay of the civil action while the criminal case moves forward 'would avoid a 
duplication of efforts and a waste of judicial time and resources."); SEC v. One or 
More Unknown Purchasers of Secs. of Global Indus., Case No. I I-cv-6500, 2012 WL 
5505738, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 9, 2012) ("the Civil Case is likely to benefit to some 
extent from the Criminal Case no matter its outcome"). 
This is the only of the numerous Epstein related civil cases that has not been 
stayed pending the Claims Program outcomes. In conferral, Plaintiff has not 
advanced a cogent reason for wanting to press ahead alone, while coyly indicating his 
client is considering participation in that same program. Duplication of this Court's 
efforts at the same time that Judge Nathan is overseeing the criminal trial cannot be 
justified by Plaintiff.

Public interest. Finally, numerous courts have recognized a stay is 
"often necessary where liberal discovery rules will allow a litigant to undermine, or 
gain an unfair advantage in, a potential criminal prosecution which parallels the 
subject matter of the civil action." SEC v. Doivne, Case No. 92-cv-4092, 1993 WL 
22126 at *12 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 26, 1993). Most commonly, government-intervenors 
request such a stay to deny criminal defendants an unfair tactical advantage by 
circumventing the limited discovery provided by Fed.R.Cr.P. 16. However, there is 
no principled reason why the same logic should not apply to a civil plaintiff opposing 
a stay who might, for example, either alone or at the behest of the U.S. Attorney's 
Office seek to gain discovery from a civil defendant that would not be available to the 
government in the criminal case. Such discovery might include testimony of the 
criminal defendant or non-cooperative witnesses. Nor could a protective order cure 
this potential circumvention: the Indictment pending against Ms. Maxwell includes 
direct quotes from her civil
 testimony that is both under seal and subject to 
a protective order in the 
case. In any event, a specific showing that plaintiff 
or the government "is likely to engage in misconduct is not necessary to conclude that 
the public's interest in witness security and integrity favors a stay." Abraaj Invest, 
2019 WL 6498282 at *3 (quotations omitted). It should be enough that discovery in 
this case, and any concomitant publicity, might allow witnesses in the criminal 
prosecution to conform their decades-old memories to that developed in the civil 
case, undermining the integrity of both proceedings. 
For the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that the Court 
enter an Order staying the case until further order of the Court, and asks that the 
parties be directed to update the Court within 10 days of either (a) Plaintiff's 
successful participation in the Voluntary Claims Resolution Program or (b) the 
conclusion of Ms. Maxwell's criminal trial. 
Respectfully Submitted, 
Laura A. Menninger

Just wanted to send a quick email to detail what is being given today. There is a box of media, including VHS, cassette, 
and microcassettes, and newspaper articles that were provided by Reiter. 
On the thumbdrive is a spreadsheet outlining what is included; items highlighted in blue are included. You will notice a 
comment "see disk tracking spreadsheet" in items not highlighted; this spreadsheet will be included in the disk copies 
we send over that will detail how many images total and how many removed. 
There are loose disks which include 1B evidence scans, 1D1-1D5 evidence items, LSJ 3D imaging, and the FBI file. 
Separately, we will keep you updated as we continue to work on the redactions and will let you know as soon as we 
finish with the disks. 
Let us know you have any questions.

Thank you so much for these—very helpful (and sorry I didn't realize the message pad scans also had the same pages 
without post-its!) 
On these: 
• Yes, please send over the copy of the gj transcript disc when you can. 
• Found the original scans from the FL file—thank you! 
• Yes, please get us the paper evidence from NY, VI, and Reiter as soon as you can. 
• We'll take the FBI file whenever you can get it to our office. 
• My understanding from past FBI cases is that CART completes some sort of paperwork documenting the dates 
on which they conduct data extractions. We need that for all of the extractions in this case, please (It may not 
be 302s). 
• On the evidence from disks, understood. In order to give you more time, we are going to tell the defense 
attorneys that the materials are available for them to review in-person if they want to schedule a time to come 
down to the FBI office, but that in the meantime we are still working on getting copies of non-nude images to 
produce to them.

Hey all, below is a summary of the discovery items you've requested. 
(USANYS) 
Message Pad Scans: The message pads were scanned with the post it notes on them and the very next page is the 
page without the post it note, so the pages are back to back. 
Papers from Miami case file (grand jury testimony): This is a disk — I can copy it and send it over to you. 
Evidence scans: Are you referring to the scans from the FL file? We sent those over with the original message pad 
scans last year. If you need that again, let us know and we can get another copy over to you. As far as paper evidence 
from the NY and VI searches, and the paper provided by Reiter, we can get that over to you by the end of the week. 
FBI file: We have that ready for you. 
CART: There are no 302s regarding the extraction of devices. 
Evidence from disks: This is a large volume and we've been working on this and removing nude/semi nude images. 
This is the only thing that would be difficult to complete by Friday. If we could have a little more time to pull this 
together, that would be very helpful.

Thanks so much for your help with the Maxwell discovery so far. I have some follow-up questions about the most 
recent batch you provided, and wanted to check in on the longer term tasks we discussed last month. 
Below are some questions regarding the discovery 
dropped off a few days ago with requests for additional items: 
• 
The last page of the attached appears to be a photograph of a disc. The label on the disc seems to suggest it 
contains grand jury transcripts. Have you given us those transcripts? 
• 
The message pad scans you provided still have post-it notes on top of several of the message pad pages. I 
think 
mentioned that each pad had been scanned twice, but I'm only seeing one copy of each pad—
and those copies all of post-its on them. That's true of nearly every "Notebook" pdf you provided in the 
"Message pad scans" folder. Would you please get us a scans of these without post-its on them? 
• 
It looks like we're still missing SW returns for the 20 mag 6719 warrant and for the NH premises warrant. 
Would you please get us copies of those returns? 
Following up on our conversation last month, I think we're still waiting on the below items from you guys. Would you 
please be able to get us these this week? 
• 
Full FBI sentinel file 
• 
CART paperwork regarding the extraction of data from all devices seized during the investigation 
• 
All 302s regarding the extraction of data from any seized devices and the review of images (both digital and 
hard copy) seized during the investigation, including from Epstein's properties. 
• 
Scans of the files Reiter provided to the FBI and provide us with all of those scanned materials 
• 
Scans of all hard copy documents, including photos, in the possession of the FBI that have not yet been 
scanned, including anything seized during any searches. Please produce to SDNY all of those scans, except any 
nude or partially nude images. For nude or partially nude images, please provide us with a log detailing how 
many such images were scanned, where they were from, and where they are being stored. 
• 
Copies of the contents of all the discs that were seized and searched pursuant to search warrants to a 
platform for review. Then please produce to SDNY a copy all of those materials, except any nude or partially 
nude images. For nude or partially nude images, please provide us with a log detailing how many such images 
were located, where they were from, and where they are being stored. 
Please let me know if you have any questions or if it would be useful to hop on a call.

Re: 
United States v. Gleislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
The Government respectfully submits this letter with respect to the protective order to be 
entered in the above-captioned case, and to respond to the defendant's letter and submission of 
July 27, 2020 (the "Defendant Letter" or "Def. Ltr.") (Dkt. 29). The Government and defense 
counsel have conferred regarding a protective order several times via telephone and email between 
July 9, 2020, and today, including as recently as this morning. The Government and defense 
counsel have come to an agreement on much of the proposed protective order. However, the 
parties disagree as to two inclusions sought by the defendant which the Government objects to and 
for which, as detailed herein, the Government submits there is no legal basis. Accordingly, the 
Government respectfully requests that the Court enter its proposed protective order (the 
"Government Proposed Order"), which is attached hereto as Exhibit A, and which differs from the 
defendant's proposed order in those two respects, as further described below. 
A. 
The Defendant's Request to be Permitted to Publicly Name and Identify Victims 
As detailed herein, the Government seeks to protect the identities of victims, consistent 
with their significant privacy interests and the well-established law in this Circuit, and proposes a 
protective order consistent with those very significant interests. In contrast, the defendant insists 
that the protective order be modified such that she and her counsel would be permitted to "publicly 
referenc[e]" individuals, by name, who have "spoken on the public record to the media or in public 
fora, or in litigation — criminal or otherwise — relating to Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell."' 
I Specifically, the defendant's proposed protective order differs from the Government's in that 
it adds a sentence, in its paragraph 6 (which is paragraph 5 of the Government Proposed Order), 
stating the following: "Nor does this Order prohibit Defense Counsel from publicly referencing 
individuals who have spoken on the record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation — criminal 
or otherwise — relating to Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell." The defendant also either adds

The Honorable Alison J. Nathan 
July 28, 2020 
Page 2 
The defendant's demand that she and her counsel be permitted to name any individuals who have 
ever publicly identified themselves as a victim of either Epstein or the defendant in any "public 
fora," and at any time, without limitation, is extraordinarily broad, unnecessary, and inappropriate, 
and should be denied. 
As an initial matter, there can be no serious question that there are significant privacy and 
victim interests at issue here, which the Government Proposed Order seeks to protect. Particularly 
in the context of victim witnesses, there are compelling reasons to limit public disclosure of victim 
identities and other sensitive information. Indeed, the Crime Victims' Rights Act, 18 U.S.C. § 
3771, requires district courts to implement procedures to ensure that crime victims are accorded, 
among other rights, "[t]he right to be reasonably protected from the accused," in addition to "[t]he 
right to be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim's dignity and privacy." Id. §§ 
(a)(1), (a)(8) (emphasis added). Moreover, "the public generally has a strong interest in protecting 
the identities of .. . victims so that other victims will not be deterred from reporting such crimes." 
United States v. Paris, 2007 WL 1484974, at *2 (D. Conn. May 18, 2007). 
Moreover, and consistent with those interests, courts in this Circuit have routinely 
acknowledged the need to protect victim-witness identities. See, e.g., United States v. Corley, 
Cr. 48 (AJN), 2016 WL 9022508, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 15, 2016) ("Because Corley's minor 
victims have significant privacy and safety interests at stake, while Corley's interests are minimal, 
the Court finds good cause to modify the protective order in this case to prevent Corley from 
learning the surnames of the minor victims."); United States v. Kelly, 07 Cr. 374 (SJ), 2008 WL 
5068820, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. July 10, 2008) ("Given the potentially explicit nature of the government 
witnesses' expected testimony, the government argues that it is necessary to conceal their identity 
to protect them from public humiliation and embarrassment. This Court agrees. Thus, the parties 
[. . .] are hereby prohibited from releasing to anyone, including members of the press, the identity 
or any identifying information of the government's witnesses."). It is similarly routine in this 
District for parties in a criminal case to refer to witnesses by pseudonyms (such as "Victim-I" or 
"Witness-1") to protect the privacy interests of third parties unless and until they testify publicly. 
The Government's proposed order endeavors to protect those interests by generally 
requiring the parties to abstain from identifying any victim by name in any public statement or 
filing while also ensuring that the defendant and her counsel are fully able to prepare for trial. 
Indeed, to facilitate the defendant's investigation and preparation for trial, the Government's 
proposal makes clear that defense counsel and defense staff, including defense investigators, 
should not be prohibited from referencing identities of individuals in conversations with 
prospective witnesses, so long as those witnesses and their counsel abstain from further disclosing 
or disseminating any such identities. See Government Proposed Order ¶ 5. The terms of the 
Government's proposed order also would permit defense counsel to refer to any individual by 
name in any filing under seal, merely requiring redaction of identifying information or the use of 
a pseudonym in public filings. The Government further proposes that defense counsel not be 
prohibited from publicly referencing individuals who have spoken—or who at some future time 
or deletes language in furtherance of its desire to publicly reference victim identities in defense 
paragraphs 7, 9, and 17 (which are Government Proposed Order paragraphs 6, 7, and 16).

speak—by name on the public record in this case, as one victim has already chosen to do, because 
those victims, and only those victims, have affirmatively chosen to be publicly identified in 
connection with this case. These proposals are reasonable, narrowly tailored, and not broader than 
necessary to protect victims' privacy interests, safety, and well-being, to avoid potential 
harassment of witnesses by the press and others, and to prevent undue embarrassment and other 
adverse consequences. At this stage in the case, permitting defense counsel to refer to witnesses 
by name in sealed filings, to refer to witnesses by name in the course of private conversations 
during their investigation, and to refer by name to individuals who have made the affirmative 
choice to be identified by name in connection with this criminal case is more than enough to enable 
the defendant ability to vigorously pursue her defense. 
The defendant has rejected this proposal because, as noted above, she believes that she and 
her counsel should be permitted to "publicly referenc[e]" individuals, by name, who have "spoken 
on the public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation — criminal or otherwise — relating 
to Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell." In support of the defendant's application for such 
sweeping ability to publicly name any such individuals, defense counsel provides only the 
conclusory assertion that an inability to publicly reference the names of victims, in court 
proceedings and beyond, will hinder their ability to investigate, prepare witnesses for trial, and 
advocate on the defendant's behalf. The Government has repeatedly asked defense counsel to 
explain how or why it would need to publicly name victims of sexual abuse to prepare for trial, 
and the defense repeatedly has declined to do so, presumably because the argument borders on the 
absurd.2
The Government's proposed protective order would do no such thing. As described above, 
the Government's proposed order would permit defense counsel and defense staff to reference the 
identities of individuals they believe may be relevant to the defense to potential witnesses and their 
counsel (who then would be prohibited from further disclosing or disseminating such identifying 
information). Government Proposed Order ¶ 5. It would further permit the defendant to publicly 
identify individuals who have chosen to speak on the record on this case. Id. ¶ 6. And it would 
permit the defendant to reference identifying information in filings made under seal. See id. 
Despite the Government's requests for clarity on the need for the defendant's requested 
modification, the sole additional reason provided by defense counsel for why it would be 
appropriate or necessary to publicly name victims is that certain of these victims have obtained 
what defense counsel described as the "benefit" of publicly identifying themselves as victims (and 
thus, as the defendant presumably would have it, deserve whatever public identification and 
scrutiny the defendant intends to invite upon them). Beyond the offensive notion that victims of 
sexual abuse experience a "benefit" by making the incredibly difficult decision to share their 
experience publicly, the suggestion that victims who receive this supposed "benefit" should 
receive fewer protections than the law ordinarily offers to victims in criminal cases is alarming. 
Permitting defense counsel to publicly identify witnesses who have not identified themselves on 
the record in this case risks subjecting witnesses to harassment and intimidation, with no 
conceivable benefit to the defense other than perhaps discouraging witnesses from cooperating 
with the Government.

Moreover, the defendant is able, at any time, to apply to the Court for a modification of the 
protective order should she be able to identify a particularized need to publicly name victims who 
have not yet identified themselves on the record in this case—as opposed to redacting their names 
from court filings, or referring to them in an anonymized fashion. As noted, to date, defense 
counsel has declined to identify to the Court or to the Government any example of why doing so 
would be necessary or helpful to the defense, or even under what circumstances the defense might 
want to do so. 
The defendant's proposal is also extraordinarily broad, and without any temporal or subject 
matter limitation as to the phrase "public fora." Adopting the defendant's proposal would mean 
that any individual who has ever self-identified as a victim ofJeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell 
publicly in any capacity would be subject to public identification by the defendant and her counsel 
in connection with this case. This would include, as hypothetical examples, someone who spoke 
to a journalist for a local story in 1997, or posted on a MySpace page followed by a handful of 
friends in 2005, or made a statement on a small podcast in 2009, or posted on Twitter to a handful 
of followers in 2013. But none of these examples of ventures into the "public fora" can possibly 
be construed as efforts by hypothetical victims to consent or choose "to self-identify," Def. Ltr. 
at 3, in a future criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell subject to extraordinary public attention 
and scrutiny. 
Additionally, while some individuals have identified themselves as victims without 
providing any details or additional information about their abuse, the defense contemplates no 
limitation of publicly associating those individuals with the details of their abuse in public defense 
statements or filings. In essence, the defendant's proposal seeks authorization to drag into the 
public glare any victim who has ever made any type of public statement of victimization—no 
matter how long ago or how brief—without that victim's knowing consent and without any 
substantive justification. That is particularly troubling given that the Government expects to make 
productions of discovery and 3500 materials well surpassing its obligations. Those productions 
will necessarily include the identities of individuals whom the Government does not expect to call 
as witnesses, and whose accounts—much less identities—will have no bearing on this case. But 
the defendant's proposal would allow her and her counsel to publicly name them in any public 
statement or filing at their sole discretion. This is plainly unnecessary for any investigative steps 
or trial preparation, would be grossly inappropriate and unfair, and would be inconsistent with the 
Crime Victims' Rights Act. 
Conversely, the Government's submission proposes that the defendant and her counsel not 
be precluded from discussing publicly individuals who identify themselves on the record in this 
criminal prosecution, because any such individuals will have made a conscious and informed 
choice to be associated publicly with this case. See Government Proposed Order¶¶ 5, 6, 8. The 
identity of any other individuals should be protected from public broadcast by the defendant and 
her counsel. 
The defendant argues that her proposed language is "nearly identical in all material 
respects" to the protective order entered in United States v. Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 (RMB) (Dkt. 38). 
Def. Ltr. at 3. In the first instance, that is false. The protective order in the Epstein case included

Page 5 
a provision stating that it did not prohibit defense counsel from publicly referencing individuals 
who had spoken on the public record in litigation relating to Jeffrey Epstein. Id. ¶ 4. Here, defense 
counsel seeks permission to publicly identify any individuals who have self-identified as victims 
of either the defendant or Epstein "to the media or in public fora, or in litigation"—a vastly broader 
allowance. Indeed, as a comparison, none of the hypothetical examples described above would 
have been subject to public naming and identification under the Epstein protective order, but every 
single one would be under the defendant's proposed order in this case. 
Additionally, beyond the differences in the language itself, there are two significant 
differences between the circumstances of the Epstein prosecution and this case. First, at the time 
the Epstein protective order was entered, there were exceptionally few victims who had identified 
themselves by name in litigation. Accordingly, the practical application of that provision was 
extremely limited. Second, and related, in the time between when the Epstein protective order was 
entered and the indictment in this case, many more victims have made public statements about 
their victimization at the hands of Epstein, and the defendant, on their own terms and in their own 
ways, including by exercising their rights under the Crime Victims' Rights Act in the context of 
the dismissal of the indictment against Jeffrey Epstein following his suicide. Those victims could 
not possibly have predicted, much less chosen, that their names would be publicly broadcast by 
defense counsel in connection with a subsequent criminal case. Victims should be able to continue 
to come forward, in the ways and in the venues they themselves choose, without fear of reprisal, 
shaming, or other consequence arising from having their identities broadcast by defense counsel 
in this case. 
In sum, the requested modification to the Government's proposed order sought by the 
defendant is contrary to precedent and the compelling privacy interests of victims. Moreover, it is 
without basis in fact or law, and, despite the Government's repeated requests for clarity, the 
defendant and defense counsel have offered no legitimate reason for their desire to be able to 
publicly identify any number of victims, in the context of this criminal case and elsewhere, other 
than a minimal, conclusory statement, without factual examples or legal support.; At bottom, the 
defendant and her counsel seek an unlimited ability to name victims and witnesses publicly, for no 
discernible reason, and without justification or legal basis. The victims of Ghislaine Maxwell and 
Jeffrey Epstein have suffered enough, and the Crime Victims' Rights Act, applicable law, and 
common decency compel far more protection of their privacy interests here than the defense 
proposal would afford. 
B. 
The Defendant's Demand that the Government Restrict Use of its Own Documents 
The defendant and her counsel also ask the Court to impose restrictions upon the 
Government in its use, through potential witnesses and their counsel, of documents it currently 
possesses, beyond the already-extensive restrictions and protections applicable to the 
To the extent defense counsel attempts to provide such examples or arguments for the first 
time in a reply filing, the Government respectfully requests leave to reply to those examples or 
arguments.

Govenunent.4 The defendant cites not a single example in any district court in the country where 
such a restriction has been imposed in a protective order. Indeed, it is nonsensical for a protective 
order to require limitations of the Government in its use of material already in its possession so 
that the Government may provide a defendant with discovery. The defendant's attempt to refuse 
to agree to receive discovery unless the Government agrees to additional restrictions upon the use 
of its own materials should be rejected. 
As an initial matter, the Government's use of materials it has gathered through its 
investigation, including through the grand jury process, search warrants, interviews, and voluntary 
disclosures, is already subject to a wide range of restrictions, including Rule 6(e) of the Federal 
Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of 1974, and other policies of the Department of 
Justice and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York. In this case, 
consistent with the Government's customary practice, and as the Government has informed 
defense counsel, the Government has no intention of providing witnesses, victims or their counsel 
with the entirety of discovery produced to the defendant, nor anything even close to that. Indeed, 
consistent with its standard practice, the Government rarely provides any third party, including a 
witness, with any material they did not already possess. While the Government does more 
commonly show a witness materials in connection with proffers or trial preparation, the 
Government rarely if ever shows a witness material she has not already seen, does not have 
personal knowledge of, or would not have some specific reason to opine upon. Practically 
speaking, therefore, the concerns defense counsel raises about future use in civil litigation are not 
likely to occur. 
Nevertheless, a criminal protective order is not the appropriate forum for the defendant to 
demand restrictions on the Government's use of its own materials. To the contrary, as noted above, 
many of those restrictions are already established by rule and law—standards the defendant makes 
no suggestion the Government has failed to adhere to in this case. Moreover, the Government as 
a whole, including those beyond the prosecutors on this case, may have obligations that would 
conflict with such language in a protective order. For example, the Government has obligations 
under various statutory and regulatory regimes, including but not limited to the Freedom of 
Information Act and Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951), that cannot be bargained away through 
a protective order. Indeed, the Government can represent that the Department of Justice has 
received both FOIA and Touhy requests in connection with this investigation, requests to which 
the Department has a legal obligation to respond appropriately. The Government respectfully 
submits it would be inappropriate for the defendant to seek—or the Court to order—language in a 
protective order that conflicts with or supersedes those obligations. Tellingly, the defendant cites 
no authority or precedent for her request regarding this issue. 
By contrast, to the extent the defendant intends to produce reciprocal discovery to the 
Government, it may in that case be appropriate to limit the Government's use, or third parties' use, 
Specifically, the defendant's proposed protective order differs from the Government's in that 
it adds a paragraph, its paragraph 3, proposing restrictions upon the Government and its potential 
witnesses, and their counsel, as well as adding language to its paragraph 5, which is Government 
paragraph 4, further restricting potential government witnesses and their counsel.

of such materials provided by the defendant to the Government. But there is no basis to add 
additional restrictions upon the Government's use of materials gathered by the Government itself. 
The defendant's only counter-argument, as noted—that this Court should put third parties 
"on equal footing with the defense"—is both unlikely to be relevant given the Government's 
standard practice, as described above, and, the Government submits, an irrelevant consideration in 
the context of a criminal protective order. Indeed, the Government respectfully submits that 
neither it nor this Court is well-positioned to, or should, become the arbiter of what is appropriate 
or permissible in civil cases. 
In sum, the defendant's attempt to restrict the Government and to restrict third parties in 
this way appears to be unprecedented, and is without legal basis, and should be denied. 
Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, the Court should enter the Government's 
proposed protective order, which is enclosed, and deny the defendant's motion.

Regarding the -interview 
from yesterday to summarize it went well. He is very cooperative and willing 
to speak again if needed. He recalls in some fashion him and 
recruiting and or bringing girls to 
Epstein. He recalls that Epstein and only Epstein would pay him $200 for the girls he brought. His interactions 
with Maxwell were very limited as he remembers. He didn't seem to think they chatted about bringing girls to 
the house. He does recall recruiting 
and giving her the pre massage speech about how it all goes 
down.

Jeffrey Epstein 
457 Madison Avenue 
New York, NY 10022 
Vicky Ward 
Vanity Fair 
Times Square 
New York, NY 10036 
Dear Ms. Ward, 
Thank you for your letter of December 19th further documenting your 
reporting style. First with respect to my house. If you recall you asked me 
on numerous occasions, whether sH
i purchased #9 outright. You followed 
up with a similar question to Mr. 
on at least 2 occasions, I have told 
you repeatedly that, yes, in fact I did purchase it outright and you tirelessly 
repeated "then why were there no transfer taxes paid?" I explained in 
writing that transfer taxes are in most instances not made public. After 
sending you documentation on #9's transfer taxes, you then continued on 
#11. Also in writing, I told Graydon that I never owned #11. Add that to 
the fact that Graydon has told me that #11 is not part of the story and once 
again, like a Gospel choir, you chant: "but what about the transfer taxes?" 
Enclosed please find a copy of the transfer taxes paid, given to you off the 
record, confirming that I was only a trustee and once again requiring me to 
spend more time on questions whose relevance you have yet to describe. 
In regard your question in your latest letter regarding refuting the 
claims of 
. Why don't you detail those claims to me so that I 
and the State Trooper can respond to any factual claims? I hope the copy of 
this letter, also given to you off the record, will be given to Vanity Fair's 
lawyers, who should at last understand there is cause for concern. I think 
you will agree that the only quote "claim" that you describe to me was that 
had felt "uncomfortable" and asked her father to immediately 
come and get her. Are you now asking me to refute how "a 
felt"? A typical tabloid-like question. Or are you asking me whether she 
left? You certainly did not ask me who paid for her move or when or how 
EFTA00026788
--- PAGE 2 ---
did she leave. (I paid.) The facts and circumstances surrounding 
behavior, attitude and actions which include hundreds of dollars of 
unauthorized country club charges for massages, misrepresentations and 
erratic outbursts are easily verified by the former State Trooper, a highly 
reputable source, who lived on the property the entire time 
was in 
residence. The trooper is a witness to what occurred during his stay in Ohio. 
He could testify to what he saw, but certainly cannot testify to what she felt. 
You have, at least until today, made no attempt whatsoever to contact this 
person that I made known to Graydon in writing, who will attest to these 
incidents and more. I can only believe the reason you have not is that 
knowing his version would contradict your article. In addition, you have 
already seen the letter 
sent after she left Ohio suggesting the idea of 
repaying her theft with paintings. Please fit
aintouts of my message sheet 
from July 1996. Specifically it refers to 
message confirming 
massage at the country club and the fact that she did not 
immediately leave Ohio. You will also find country club bills detailing her 
financial misdeeds. With respect to 
M, 
you will recall that you 
specifically told me that there had been no allegations with respect 
I 
was shocked then, to say the least, when the fact checker then faxed 
Ghislaine with the allegations regarding 
, in a fax dated only last 
Friday. You must admit that you had made no mention of this at any 
previous time. I have already sent documentation from 
comprising a postcard written from Thailand after her ranch visit confirming 
her hardly disturbed attitude. Enclosed lease find additional 
correspondence from 
and 
who helped her research student 
programs after her ranch visit. These are also given to you off the record. 
I would like to point out to you that your statement the quotes were 
read to me in context, could be best exemplified by your question, "have you 
ever upgraded your friends to first class and why?" The context as you put it 
was only made clear when Erin Gladney faxed me the question: "we are also 
wondering if at any time you put upgrade stickers on airline tickets for any 
employees or friends of yours, if so can you explain how they work". Not 
exactly a quote read to me in context is it? If you truly believe that my 
quotes were read to me in context, I see no reason why you would not now 
send them to me in writing. 
Please pay me the minimum courtesy and deny to me in writing the 
fact, or as you wrote it, the allegation contained in my letter to Graydon, the 
fact that on numerous occasions you have tirelessly repeated the sentence: "I 
am only a journalist hired by my editor to do a story and then required to 
publish what I hear". I am sure you now understand that this sentence 
EFTA00026789
--- PAGE 3 ---
denigrates both you, your magazine and your profession. So if you did not 
on numerous occasions repeat this sentence to me I will accept your denial 
in writing. 
Last, is the sentence in your letter that illustrates the lack of care and 
inattention to detail that you have so consistently portrayed. I know you can 
do better. You state that you "have simply been investigating these matters 
with people with knowledgeable sources". I am unqualified to comment on 
the sentence's grammar, but can only assume this will in future allow you to 
fall back on the idea that the inaccuracies and negligence weren't yours, they 
weren't even your sources, they could only be attributable to the lack of care 
of the so called people whose own sources must have misled them. For the 
record, I would also suggest to you that you repeatedly gave me inaccurate 
accounts of your deadline to, I believe, give me the false impression that 
time did not allow me to adequately research and respond. 
Sincerely, 
Jeffrey Epstein 
P.S. In one of your last calls you referred to Michael Stroll as one of my 
clients. This was never true. 
Reminder, this letter with its enclosures are all given to you off the record as 
it's sole purpose is to correct inaccuracies in your story. 
Dictated but not read 
Enclosure: 7 pages 
EFTA00026790
--- PAGE 4 ---
On the basis of what I provided you off the record, you now understand that 
alleged feelings of uncomfortablness grew out of her own 
financial misdeeds. It is impossible to accurately tell this story without 
including these financial facts that would be deeply embarrassing to 
However if you choose to include this highly subjective and undocumented 
material relating to her feelings you would have an obligation to tell the 
whole story including her financial misdeeds based on her own admissions, 
so long as you can do so without attributing the documents to me

Hello 
Apologies for the slight delay. My client is willing to help but asks the following: 
• 
That there be a morning meeting at which introductions with a discussion as to the investigation and my clients 
involvement. I appreciate that you have explained this to me but I think further verbal clarification would assist. 
• 
In the afternoon and after a break, my client would be willing to answer questions, in so far as she can. 
• 
That a friend of hers be allowed to be present as well. However that friend is based in the US and would need 
to be flown over to London. He is a US lawyer. 
Perhaps you could let me know if this is possible?

some of the additional follow-up questions you asked, and to describe in more detail for your client how we would

The absolute most important thing is that any discussion would be entirely voluntary, and by that we mean the 
decision to meet with us but also as to any topic or question—your client would be absolutely free to determine 
what topics she felt comfortable discussing. There is absolutely no pressure on victim witnesses to address anything 
that would make them uncomfortable at any time, and even if your client was willing to meet with us, we would tell 
EFTA00026795
--- PAGE 3 ---
her, as we do for any witness, that if any topic comes up that she wants to skip, or discuss with you privately, that is 
no problem at all. 
In fact, if you and she would prefer, we would be happy to have a meeting where we simply introduced ourselves, 
explained the status of our investigation, talked about how a discussion would proceed if your client ended up being 
comfortable with that, and answered in person any questions she. We have done that previously, where we do the 
talking rather than asking questions in an initial meeting, and that would of course be without any requirement for 
anything additional if she preferred not to. As I mentioned on the phone, we have consistently found that we are 
able to reassure individuals when we have the opportunity to meet in person so they can see directly our interest in 
approaching these discussions with great sensitivity and care. As I also mentioned on the phone, even if your client 
were willing to speak with us, there would be absolutely no need or requirement for her to talk about any assault or 
victimization she experienced. We wrote in our first email that we would primarily be interested in talking about 
topics such as the general scope of her employment, directions she received from Epstein or Maxwell, etc., and as 
always we would be guided by her comfort level. 
In terms of who would attend a meeting, we almost always work in pairs, so two prosecutors and two officers, and 
that's not to have extra people, but rather because it helps us to be as efficient as we can, and so witnesses can meet 
the people on the team. Our team is also majority female, and we always tell witnesses that if topics come up in a 
discussion that they would prefer to speak about just with women, that's fine and we can be flexible in the moment 
and are always guided by the comfort level of the victim. But I also want to stress that in terms of your client in 
particular, we don't expect to initially address issues of a very personal or sexual nature, and we certainly would tell 
you in advance if there came a time when we thought that might be important to address, and how we could 
facilitate that. Who exactly from our team would be at any meeting would depend on schedules, but we can assure 
you that every one of us has now spoken with dozens of victims in this case, and every one of us has extensive 
experience more generally working with victims and working on cases involving sex offenses. We are proud of how 
we have been able to work with victims in this case especially, given all of the circumstances, and we absolutely 
would take the same sensitive approach with your client as we have with the many other victims in this case who 
have spoken with us. 
Again, if it would be helpful even for us to just come to the U.K. and introduce ourselves and explain in person how 
our process works, and answer any questions your client has in person, we would absolutely be happy to do that 
with no obligation at all from her. We also could do that with the possibility that if she felt comfortable, we could 
just address the general subject of her employment, for example. But no obligation and no pressure. We continue 
to appreciate your and her willingness to even broach the possibility of a discussion, and we hope this is helpful. 
thank you very much,

Thanks for circling back, and we'll do our best to answer these questions. In terms of who would be in the room, the 
most likely answer is that it would be two of the prosecutors and the two law enforcement officers on the case. The 
only reason I saw "most likely" rather than having a definitive answer is that when we're interviewing in a foreign 
country, it sometimes is the case the local law enforcement also insists on having representatives present. I don't 
believe that's required in the U.K., but we can check on it and give you a definitive answer in the coming days if that's 
useful. (Also, if she preferred to be interviewed in the U.S., we certainly could guarantee that the room would be just 
the case team, and we could arrange for travel and lodging for her. Let us know if that's the case, but otherwise 
we're of course happy to travel to her.) 
Regarding access to notes, it would principally be the investigative team—so again, the prosecutors and the FBI team 
working on the case. Our respective supervisors also theoretically have access to our files, but the reports are not 
generally widely disseminated. The basic logistics are that an agent takes notes during an interview, and then types 
up those notes into a formal report (called an FBI Form 302). We don't ordinarily share notes with other entities, but 
I can also check on that to see if I can make a more specific representation with respect to your client. 
With respect to anonymity, I confess that I'm not familiar with the distinction you're referring to. In terms of our 
investigation, we don't publicly disclose the names of individuals we meet with, and we don't disclose to any other 
witnesses, for example, the identities of victims or witnesses we are meeting with. (And our policies on that don't 
change even for individuals who are in the position of your client, who have been widely publicly reported to have 
been connected to Epstein and/or his employees or associates). But if that doesn't answer your question, we're of 
course happy to discuss further. Let me know if it might be useful to have a call? Or if not, also happy to address any 
follow-up via email. 
thanks,

Hi 
Thanks for this. I've been asked who would be in the room and thereafter who would have access to any 
notes made. Would her permission be sought before disclosing to any other parties or officials? 
As you know there is a real difficulty in relation to her anonymity in the US versus the UK. Are you able to 
provide any comfort on this? 
Many thanks

Thank you again for speaking with us earlier today regarding our interest in talking with your client in connection 
with our investigation into the conduct of Jeffrey Epstein. 
As requested, we wanted to briefly memorialize our current views and understandings of your client, and also to 
reiterate our interest in approaching any discussion with great care and sensitivity, particularly to avoid adding to 
her trauma or causing re-victimization. 
As we mentioned on the phone, your client is not a target of our investigation—it sounds like the analogue in the 
U.K. may be the "suspect" category—and we currently do not have reason to believe that she has committed any 
U.S. federal crime. As we discussed, our knowledge of your client specifically is somewhat limited, having never 
spoken to her—and therefore knowing about her only through other witnesses and records—but it certainly has 
been our experience that the overwhelming majority of young women and girls who were in the orbit of Jeffrey 
Epstein during the relevant periods were subject to his abuse. It does not surprise us, nor do we have any trouble 
believing, that your client was similarly a victim. I hope that is helpful in understanding the capacity in which we 
hope to speak with her. 
Separately, and as we also discussed, any discussion with our team would be entirely voluntary—and that extends 
not just to whether she would be willing to meet with us at all, but also including her ability to decline to discuss 
particular topics or even particular questions, and to talk with her counsel at any time, to take any breaks that 
would be beneficial while we're meeting, etc. 
In terms of topic areas, we would be hoping to learn about the general narrative of her interactions with Epstein 
and his other associates and employees, including Ghislaine Maxwell, whom we understand she may have worked 
directly for. That would broadly include how she came to be in contact with them, the nature and scope of her 
employment, any instructions she was given relating to other women or girls, and just generally her experiences 
and observations in interacting with them. We ordinarily would also be interested in understanding the general 
nature of the abuse she was subjected to, but I want to emphasize that we would not need to discuss with her the 
specifics if she weren't comfortable with that, and in particular we often don't even broach that subject in a first 
meeting. 
Please let us know if you have any additional questions, and in particular whether any other information from us 
would be useful, and we look forward to speaking with you again soon.

2) I recognize that we do not have a complete picture of Maxwell's current finances. I don't think it makes sense to

about her current assets. In addition, it would be helpful to know if there are any significant transfers from 
Epstein's account to Maxwell since 2005. Along the same line, a check for more recent alerts in FinCEN would be 
helpful. 
3) On the topic of assets, can you tell us what properties Maxwell currently owns? 
4) Could you please send us the current tracking document for the hotline? It would be helpful for us to check

Re: 
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) 
Dear Counsel: 
We write in response to your letters dated September 21, 2020 and October I, 2020 
regarding the above-referenced case. 
1. The Government Has Met Its Discovery Obligations 
As an initial matter, you repeatedly assert that the Government "has not met its discovery 
obligations." (Sept. 21, 2020 Ltr. at 4; Oct. I, 2020 Ltr. at 1, 3). The Government respectfully 
disagrees. The deadline for the production of Rule 16 discovery set by the Court, including but 
not limited to "electronic materials" is November 9, 2020, which is more than a month away. (Dkt. 
25). The deadline for "initial non-electronic discovery, generally to include search warrant 
applications and subpoena returns," was due on August 21, 2020, and, as you are aware, the 
Government in fact made a substantial initial production before that deadline. (Id. (emphasis 
added)). 
The Government has also made substantial efforts to ensure that copies of the discovery 
produced to defense counsel are also available to the defendant at the Metropolitan Detention 
EFTA00026813
--- PAGE 2 ---
Page 2 
Center ("MDC"). And while there have been technical difficulties with certain of the productions 
made to the defendant, the Government understands that defense counsel is able to access all of 
the material, and, as detailed herein, we have worked promptly to address each concern you have 
raised with respect to productions made directly to the defendant. In sum, your claim that the 
Government has not met its discovery obligations because of the delay caused by your requests to 
reformat and rebum the discovery is simply inaccurate. The Government has met its discovery 
obligations and will continue to do so in the remaining month prior to the relevant discovery 
deadline. 
In addition, as set forth below, the Government has conferred with MDC counsel regarding 
the various complaints you have raised in your September 21 and October 1 letters in order to 
accommodate your requests and in order to ensure that the defendant can timely review discovery. 
2. The Government's Extensive Efforts to Ensure the Defendant Can Review 
Discovery at MDC 
The Government has taken considerable efforts to address the defendant's complaints 
about her access to discovery in this case. As an initial matter, when making its productions, the 
Government had no reason to believe the defendant would be unable to review any of the discovery 
materials at the MDC. Indeed, the Government notes that it followed the same procedure in 
producing discovery to defense counsel as it did to the defendant. Nor could the Government 
possibly have anticipated which of the hundreds of thousands of files produced to date the 
defendant would be unable to view using the computer provided to her by the MDC. However, as 
soon as defense counsel notified the Government on August 27, 2020 that the defendant could not 
access a portion of the discovery materials, the Government worked with its paralegal and 
Information Technology staff to create new copies of the discovery materials you identified in a 
new format. Due to the volume of files requiring review and reprocessing, that process took 
several days. Once the files were reformatted, the Government loaded them onto a new drive, 
which it sent to the MDC on September 3, 2020. 
Subsequently, your September 21, 2020 letter identified a portion of the Government's first 
three productions that the defendant was unable to view at the MDC. The Government notes that 
even without being able to view those files, the defendant was still able to review tens of thousands 
of pages of discovery while awaiting correction of the technological problem, and the Government 
understands, as noted, that defense counsel has been able to view the entirety of the productions. 
Since learning from you that the defendant was experiencing difficulty viewing certain files, the 
Government has taken several steps to ensure that the defendant has access to every file. 
First, the Government has worked with its paralegal and Information Technology staff to 
create new copies of the discovery materials you identified in your September 21, 2020 letter. That 
process involved converting certain files into new formats, changing the names of certain files, 
and providing software programs to help run certain files. Due to the extent of this review and 
reprocessing, these steps took several days. Once the files were reformatted, the Government 
loaded them onto a new drive, which it sent to the MDC on October 2, 2020. The cover letter 
accompanying that production included instructions for how the defendant may access the files 
she previously had difficulty viewing.

Second, the Government has asked MDC legal counsel to send an MDC Information 
Technology ("IT") staff member to examine the computer the defendant is using to review her 
discovery at the MDC. The Government has asked that the IT staff member load any software 
necessary to view the files that the defendant has had difficulty accessing onto her MDC computer. 
The Government understands from MDC legal counsel that an IT staff member has completed 
such a review of the defendant's computer at the MDC. Should the defendant have difficulty 
accessing files on the MDC computer in the future, she should alert MDC staff and request another 
review of the computer by IT staff. 
The Government also asked MDC legal counsel to ensure that the defendant has a writing 
surface on which to take notes while reviewing discovery. MDC legal counsel has informed the 
Government that MDC staff has repositioned the items on the table at which the defendant reviews 
discovery such that she can use the table as a writing surface. MDC legal counsel has also 
informed the Government that the defendant has access to a privacy screen to use when reviewing 
discovery on the MDC computer. MDC legal counsel further noted that the defendant currently 
has more access to discovery than any other inmate in the facility. 
Third, as a stopgap while completing the above processes, the Government reminded 
defense counsel that counsel is permitted to bring a laptop containing copies of any discovery 
materials produced to date into the MDC to review with the defendant. The Government 
understands from MDC legal counsel that that defense counsel is aware of this permission and has 
been able to visit the defendant in person at the MDC on multiple occasions. 
Taken together, these steps should ensure that the defendant has access to the discovery 
productions made to date and with many months left to review those productions before trial. The 
Government will continue to work with defense counsel and the MDC to address any issues that 
may arise regarding the defendant's access to discovery. 
3. The Government's Efforts to Ensure that the Defendant Can Review Highly 
Confidential Materials 
Since receiving your request for your client to review Highly Confidential discovery 
material in the FBI's possession, the Government has taken several steps to address your request. 
Due to the ongoing pandemic, the United States Marshals Service ("USMS") will not produce a 
defendant from the MDC to the courthouse for any reason other than a court appearance. 
Accordingly, the Government cannot take the usual step of requesting the USMS to produce the 
defendant to a proffer room in the courthouse where she can review the Highly Confidential 
materials with defense counsel present. 
As an alternative, the FBI has agreed to assign two agents to bring a secure laptop 
containing the Highly Confidential materials to the MDC, where defense counsel and the 
defendant may review the Highly Confidential materials together. So long as defense counsel 
submits to a search to ensure that no electronic devices or electronic storage media is being brought 
into the attorney visiting room, the agents will permit defense counsel and the defendant to review 
the computer alone while the agents wait outside the room. The FBI has loaded the secure laptop 
EFTA00026815
--- PAGE 4 ---
Page 4 
with all of the approximately 43,500 images that were seized from Jeffrey Epstein's residences in 
New York and the Virgin Islands.' Accordingly, the FBI is prepared to facilitate the review of 
these items as soon as the MDC will permit such a visit. The FBI understands that defense counsel 
and the defendant may require multiple meetings to review all of the images and is accordingly 
prepared to bring the secure laptop to the MDC on multiple dates. 
The Government has asked MDC legal counsel to authorize the FBI to bring the Highly 
Confidential materials into the facility for defense counsel and the defendant to review. In 
response, MDC legal counsel indicated that such visits require authorization from the Warden. 
The Government urged MDC legal counsel to approve the proposed visits as quickly as possible, 
and today, the Government learned that the Warden has approved this proposal. The FBI and 
MDC can accommodate a visit next week, and the Government will coordinate with defense 
counsel, the FBI, and the MDC to assist with scheduling this first and any subsequent visits. 
Additionally, as the Government has repeatedly informed you, defense counsel may 
schedule a time to come to the FBI offices in Manhattan to review the above-referenced 43,500 
images, as well as any other physical items referenced in the discovery productions. Those 
appointments can be made with much less notice because they do not require arranging the 
logistics of providing Highly Confidential images to an incarcerated defendant. 
Finally, the Government is still processing the 40,000 of the above-referenced images that 
do not contain nudity for production to counsel and to the defendant at the MDC. Due to the 
volume of those images, that process has taken multiple weeks. The Government expects that the 
images will be ready to produce within approximately one week. 
4. Conditions of Confinement 
Since receiving your September 21, 2020 letter, the Government has consulted with MDC 
legal counsel regarding the defendant's conditions of confinement. As discussed on our September 
22, 2020 call, immediately after receiving your letter, the Government contacted MDC legal 
counsel, and within approximately 24 hours, the Government had answers to several of the 
concerns raised in the letter, which the Government conveyed to you over the phone. Over the 
next two weeks, the Government awaited responses regarding the other complaints raised in your 
September 21, 2020 letter from the MDC. The Government has now received responses from 
MDC legal, which are incorporated herein. 
First, MDC legal counsel indicated that the staff assigned to the defendant have worked to 
minimize the delays identified in your September 21, 2020 letter. As a result, the defendant should 
have up to thirteen hours per day of access to discovery, though she may also use that time for 
other activities, such as attorney visits, calls, recreation, and personal hygiene. That amount of 
time far exceeds the discovery access any other MDC inmate currently enjoys. MDC legal counsel 
Of those 43,500 images, approximately 3,500 contain nude or partially nude images, and 
approximately 40,000 do not contain nudity. Per your request, the FBI has loaded all 43,500 
images together onto a laptop so that defense counsel and the defendant may review all of the 
seized images at the same time. 
EFTA00026816

Page 5 
also confirmed that staff will not put their fingers into the defendant's mouth for any searches. 
The Government inquired of MDC legal counsel whether the defendant could be permitted to sleep 
in the rec room where her computer and shower are located instead of the isolation cell. In 
response, MDC legal counsel indicated that the defendant will be required to sleep in the isolation 
cell. According to MDC legal counsel, the Bureau of Prisons ("BOP") and MDC still feel that this 
is the most appropriate placement for the defendant, both for her safety and the security of the 
institution. 
Second, the Government inquired of MDC legal counsel whether it would be possible to 
reduce the number of body scans conducted on the defendant. In response, MDC legal counsel 
indicated that the defendant will be required to undergo weekly body scans. According to MDC 
legal counsel, the BOP and MDC believe these scans are necessary for the security of the 
institution. 
Third, MDC legal counsel has informed the Government that the defendant has the same 
access to commissary as any other inmate at the facility. As noted during our September 22, 2020 
call, the defendant was provided with two different sizes of sports bras to choose from, and MDC 
legal counsel understands that at least one of those sizes was acceptable to the defendant. 
Fourth, as referenced during our September 22, 2020 call, the Government has been 
assured by MDC legal counsel that the defendant is receiving three meals per day. According to 
MDC legal counsel, MDC staff now wait until later in the day to pick up the defendant's meals for 
each day, thereby ensuring that every portion of the meal (including side dishes and vegetables) is 
included. MDC legal counsel has also assured the Government that MDC staff keep the 
defendant's meals in a refrigerator to ensure that her food remains fresh. Additionally, if the 
defendant misses a meal due to a legal visit or other appointment, MDC staff will leave the meal 
for the defendant to eat upon her return. MDC legal counsel also noted that the defendant has 
purchased and received a number of supplemental food items from commissary, including, among 
other items, granola, mackerel, cheese, nutrition bars, soup, tortillas, crackers, honey buns, 
sausage, eggplant parmesan, and nuts. Further, MDC legal counsel has informed the Government 
that the defendant is seen by medical staff once per week. At those appointments, the defendant 
is weighed and told her weight. 
Fifth, as noted during our September 22, 2020 call, MDC legal counsel has indicated that 
the defendant has received all mail that the MDC has received addressed to her and in compliance 
with BOP regulations. MDC legal counsel confirmed that letters sent on colored paper do not 
comply with BOP regulations and would be rejected. If a letter is rejected, the defendant will 
receive a notification of the rejection. MDC legal counsel further indicated that inmates are not 
permitted to receive care packages of food or other items from outside vendors, but the defendant 
can purchase legal pads and pens from commissary. MDC legal counsel further informed the 
Government that the MDC has not received any copies of The New York Times addressed to the 
defendant.

In sum, the Government has met and will continue to meet its discovery obligations, and 
has worked expeditiously to address all of the concerns you have raised regarding the defendant's 
access to discovery and conditions of confinement. We remain available and willing to address 
any questions or concerns that may arise.

Re: 
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) 
Dear Counsel: 
We write in response to your letters dated September 21, 2020 and October I, 2020 
regarding the above-referenced case. 
1. The Government Has Met Its Discovery Obligations 
As an initial matter, you repeatedly assert that the Government "has not met its discovery 
obligations." (Sept. 21, 2020 Ltr. at 4; Oct. I, 2020 Ltr. at 1, 3). The Government respectfully 
disagrees. The deadline for the production of Rule 16 discovery set by the Court, including but 
not limited to "electronic materials" is November 9, 2020, which is more than a month away. (Dkt. 
25). The deadline for "initial non-electronic discovery, generally to include search warrant 
applications and subpoena returns," was due on August 21, 2020, and, as you are aware, the 
Government in fact made a substantial initial production before that deadline. (Id. (emphasis 
added)). 
The Government has also made substantial efforts to ensure that copies of the discovery 
produced to defense counsel are also available to the defendant at the Metropolitan Detention 
EFTA00026819
--- PAGE 2 ---
Page 2 
Center ("MDC"). And while there have been technical difficulties with certain of the productions 
made to the defendant, the Government understands that defense counsel is able to access all of 
the material, and, as detailed herein, we have worked promptly to address each concern you have 
raised with respect to productions made directly to the defendant. In sum, your claim that the 
Government has not met its discovery obligations because of the delay caused by your requests to 
reformat and rebum the discovery is simply inaccurate. The Government has met its discovery 
obligations and will continue to do so in the remaining month prior to the relevant discovery 
deadline. 
In addition, as set forth below, the Government has conferred with MDC counsel regarding the 
various complaints you have raised in your September 21 and October 1 letters in order to 
accommodate your requests and in order to ensure that the defendant can timely review discovery. 
2. The Government's Extensive Efforts to Ensure the Defendant Can Review 
Discovery at MDC 
The Government has taken considerable efforts to address the defendant's complaints 
about her access to discovery in this case. As an initial matter, when making its productions, the 
Government had no reason to believe the defendant would be unable to review any of the discovery 
materials at the MDC. Indeed, the Government notes that it followed the same procedure in 
producing discovery to defense counsel as it did to the defendant. Nor could the Government 
possibly have anticipated which of the hundreds of thousands of files produced to date the 
defendant would be unable to view using the computer provided to her by the MDC. However, as 
soon as defense counsel notified the Government on August 27, 2020 that the defendant could not 
access a portion of the discovery materials, the Government worked with its paralegal and 
Information Technology staff to create new copies of the discovery materials you identified in a 
new format. Due to the volume of files requiring review and reprocessing, that process took 
several days. Once the files were reformatted, the Government loaded them onto a new drive, 
which it sent to the MDC on September 3, 2020. 
Subsequently, your September 21, 2020 letter identified a portion of the Government's first 
three productions that the defendant was unable to view at the MDC. The Government notes that 
even without being able to view those files, the defendant was still able to review tens of thousands 
of pages of discovery while awaiting correction of the technological problem, and the Government 
understands, as noted, that defense counsel has been able to view the entirety of the productions.

Government has taken several steps to ensure that the defendant has access to every file.

process involved converting certain files into new formats, changing the names of certain files, 
and providing software programs to help run certain files. Due to the extent of this review and 
reprocessing, these steps took several days. Once the files were reformatted, the Government 
loaded them onto a new drive, which it sent to the MDC on October 2, 2020. The cover letter 
accompanying that production included instructions for how the defendant may access the files 
she previously had difficulty viewing.

been able to visit the defendant in person at the MDC on multiple occasions. 
Taken together, these steps should ensure that the defendant has access to the discovery

Government will continue to work with defense counsel and the MDC to address any issues that 
may arise regarding the defendant's access to discovery.

Hi-, 
Hope you're doing well, and thanks very much for your help with privilege issues for this review. In our review of this 
database, we have come across some communications (emails and reports)from private investigators— among 
others, an investigator named Roy Black. We are generally aware that Epstein hired private investigators in 
connection with a criminal investigation and related civil litigation in Florida. 
We don't know whether these materials are privileged. Could you possibly confer with the estate attorneys to 
determine whether they are asserting a privilege over communications by private investigators? In the meantime, we 
will stop reviewing the database unless we hear from you otherwise. 
Thanks very much,

formal applications. Also similar to prior trips, we'd like to request approval to get a conference room for one of those

Also based on our discussion earlier we'll be mindful of looking for domestic (or domestic-flagged) carrier flights, as well 
as the costs of any alternatives, in looking at possible specific bookings. Thanks as always for your help and input on 
that.

I was in the midst of making your travel reservations, but I'm unable to see the return flight from PNS — LGA 
departing at 6:44pm on 2/19, arriving at 12:03am on 2/20 that you requested in the attached email below. I assume that 
it's no longer available. 
The latest flight returning to LGA is leaving at 4:06pm, which I assume is too early. The latest return flight time I found 
that's fully refundable is departing PNS at 5:53pm, arriving in JFK at 1:24am on 2/20/20. Let me know if this flight is okay 
to book and I'll reserve it ASAP. Thanks.

Hi 
>; 
Would you please help us book travel to Pensacola, FL and back for next week? I'd like refundable tickets for the following 
flights, please: 
• 
Tuesday 2/18 American Airlines flight from LGA to PNS, departing 5:00 PM, arriving 9:03 PM (layover in DCA) 
• 
Wednesday 2/19 American Airlines flight from PNS to WA, departing 6:44 PM, arriving 12:03 AM (layover in CLT) 
Please make sure the tickets are refundable just in case we need to move things around. We are still waiting to hear back 
from the agents about where exactly we should be staying for the hotel, so we'd like to just book the flights for now, and 
I'll let you know when we have a more precise location for the hotel. 
Thanks very much,

Similar to prior requests in connection with the Epstein investigation (2018R01618), but with an added international

Sweden, next week on January 29th and/or 30th. We expect to be traveling, respectively, some combination of the 27th 
(overnight) to the 31st, depending on when the interview ends up being scheduled, and we'll put final dates on our 
formal applications. Also similar to prior trips, we'd like to request approval to get a conference room for one of those 
days at a hotel for the interview itself. 
Also based on our discussion earlier we'll be mindful of looking for domestic (or domestic-flagged) carrier flights, as well 
as the costs of any alternatives, in looking at possible specific bookings. Thanks as always for your help and input on 
that.

three days next week for meetings and interviews in West Palm Beach, Florida. As of now we tentatively expect to fly

Unfortunately we're still trying to pin down timing for interviewing the victims, so depending on the timing it will either

Totally understand, just wanted to alert you to the technical issues that may slow things down. In the interim, I've created 
a Saved Search with all the Search Warrant Returns and the 1.23.20 Load. It's called "SW Returns Plus 1.23.20 Load" so 
you can run your searches in that. Let me know if you want me add any more fields or modify it.

Totally understand it's voluminous, but we do to need to move it because otherwise our searching process will be all 
messed up —we won't be able to run terms through all search warrant returns (instead, we'd have to duplicate literally 
every search across two different huge folders). And it doesn't work to just search all materials in the entire file because 
the FBI case file is also huge. 
If going forward there is any question at all on where things should go in the folder structure, we're more than happy to

We've received a hard drive from FBI CART, which they've processed from devices seized and searched in connection 
with the Epstein case. Can we please get those materials uploaded to Relativity, for privilege review by 
(copied 
here)? I've left the hard drive with the materials on your chair. (And if we could please get that hard drive back once 
the materials are uploaded, the FBI has another batch they want to transmit to us for the same process, so that will 
also be coming shortly.) 
And then M, these will be subject to just the exact same privilege review you previously ran in connection with 
Epstein search warrant returns. 
Please let us know if any questions or issues at all? And thanks very much as always.

Attorney Gloria Allred said she placed an ad on a school bus that circled Buckingham Palace this morning, calling for him 
to talk to the FBI about the Jeffrey Epstein case. 
The bus carried a large picture of the prince accompanied by the message -- "If you see this man please ask him to call 
the FBI to answer their questions." 
Allred just discussed her stunt outside criminal court in Lower Manhattan, where she is attending the Harvey Weinstein 
trial.

All, 
Today the Marshals and the FBI informed me that they are able to arrange for your client and the evidence to be at 500 
Pearl in time for the review to start as early as 8am each morning of the review period. The review can still continue until 
4:30pm each day. In order to take advantage of the extra time, I would propose planning to begin each review day at 
8:30am. You would also be welcome to arrive as early at 8am, and if the Marshals and FBI are ready to begin before 8:30, 
then we can do so. I will plan to be at 500 Pearl by 8am each morning. 
Also, the CSOs have asked for a list of everyone from the defense team who should be granted access into the proffer area 
on the fifth floor of 500 Pearl for the review. Would you please send me a list of the names of everyone who you expect 
to attend the review? 
Thank you,

Subject: RE: US v. Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes 
Laura, 
Below please find responses to the issues you raised: 
• We are confirmed for the review at the Bronx warehouse on April 12, 2021 from 11am to 4:30pm. 
• During the April 12th review, your team can see the evidence for yourselves and let me know if you need any of the 
items you are not permitted to photograph to be brought to 500 Pearl. Depending on the size of the item(s), we 
may need to figure out whether they can be brought later in the week once you have already reviewed several 
boxes, which would free up space in the FBI vehicle for the larger items. I'm confident we will be able to reach a 
reasonable agreement about those items. 
• For the bulky photos, you will not be permitted to photograph any that feature nudity. As referenced above, once 
your team has seen those photos for yourselves, you can let me know if you will need any to be brought to 500 
Pearl. 
• As I mentioned previously and is indicated in the spreadsheet, we are preparing a letter to defense counsel 
explaining why you will not be permitted to review those 16 discs. We expect to send you that letter tomorrow, 
after which I will be happy to discuss the matter further. 
• The blue-ray discs referenced in the spreadsheet are what the FBI burned in order to provide the USAO SDNY with 
a copy of electronic data to produce to you in discovery. The discs are not evidence themselves. The data is the 
evidence, and it was produced to you already. You are correct, however, that the 4/24/07 file is a data file that was 
copied from a VHS tape, which is currently located in the FBI's ELSUR office in Florida. We have asked that the 
original tape be shipped to New York, and it should arrive on Tuesday, April 13th. We will make it available for you 
to review once we have received it. We also plan to produce the digital file of that same recording to you as part of 
our productions of non-testifying witness statements. 
• The shredded paper is currently being analyzed by the FBI lab. We have asked the case agent to inquire with the 
lab regarding its anticipated timeline for analysis and will let you know when we expect it will be possible to have 
the shredded paper returned to New York for you to review. It will not, however, be available next week. 
• The "Missing from Assigned Box" items are items 1B130 and 1B110. Those items were migrated within the FBI 
evidence system from the Florida case to the New York case and incorporated into New York evidence item 
EFTA00026873
--- PAGE 3 ---
numbers 1B127, 18128, & 16137. So these items will be available for your review under those New York evidence 
numbers.

Subject: RE: US v. Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes 
My apologies, I meant to include in my previous email that we could have the Bronx view on Monday April 12. Thank you 
for the logistics. 
Regarding the spreadsheets you provided, I have several issues. 
First, there are a couple of items that you have noted for the Bronx Warehouse but will in fact need to be brought to 500 
Pearl for review because you labeled them as "Highly Confidential" and not "bulky." These appear to include: 
NY Evidence List 
• Items 16127-130 (4 boxes). 
• Item 1813 (1 box) 
Florida Evidence List 
• Item 1, Subitem 26 — one large framed photo from Master Bedroom. 
Second, with regard to the "Bulky" photos (Florida Items 1, Subitems 8, 15a, 15b and 15c), are we permitted to 
photograph those or not? If not, we will need them transported to 500 Pearl. 
Third, Florida Item 8, Subitem 8, says it is Sixteen DVD-R Discs from PBSO but you do not indicate that we can review 
those. Why? We need to address with the Court promptly any issues related to our request to view all evidence. 
Fourth, Electronic surveillance — Your email yesterday stated that these were all "electronic files" with no corresponding 
physical item. However, for several, the chart indicates "Blu-Ray Disks;" is there a reason we cannot inspect these? 
Another Florida item is listed as "one original recording of an interview dated 4/24/07"; I am suspicious that "one original 
recording of an interview" is not truly only an "electronic" file? I was practicing law in 2007 and do not recall "electronic 
files" being the standard then. Can you please confirm? I know that Chris has written separately about the many files for 
EFTA00026874
--- PAGE 4 ---
which the metadata has apparently been stripped, so we will have to address purely electronic information at another 
date. 
Shredded Paper — Yes, we need to review that as well. 
"Missing from Assigned Box" items — can you please provide more of an explanation for all "missing items"? 
I will let you know any other issues as I see them. However, now that we have made travel plans in reliance on your 
agreement to produce all evidence items, I am hoping that you can promptly answer these questions so that we can 
resolve any of them as needed this week. 
Thank you,

Hi Laura,

The Bronx warehouse is located at 2350 Lafayette Ave, Bronx, NY. There is plenty of street parking outside of the 
building. Whatever day you wish to have the review conducted at the warehouse, an AUSA and an agent will meet the 
attorney, investigator, and paralegal at the warehouse to escort them into the building to the evidence review room. The 
AUSA will remain present at the warehouse to answer any questions that may arise. 
The FBI has informed me that they can make the evidence available for review at the warehouse any day next week or the 
week of April 19th. Please just let me know what day you prefer, and we will coordinate with the FBI to arrange for the 
review.

Thank you for the updated spreadsheets and the information regarding the timing of the review at 500 Pearl. 
I believe we will be able to have an attorney, investigator and paralegal present at the Bronx warehouse to take photos of

Good morning, 
Attached please find the revised spreadsheets, which reflect designations under the Protective Order for the three mini-
VHS tapes that I referenced below. 
I learned this morning that the Marshals intend to bring Ms. Maxwell back to the MDC each review day at 4:30pm. So we 
can plan for the review to take place at 500 Pearl Street from 9:30am to 4:30pm each day beginning on April 13th.

Subject: RE: US v. Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes 
Good evening, 
Today, the Marshals confirmed that they will produce Ms. Maxwell to 500 Pearl Street on April 13, 2021 and every day 
thereafter until the evidence review is complete. My understanding is that Ms. Maxwell should arrive to 500 Pearl Street 
at approximately 9:30am each morning. So we are confirmed for evidence review in the proffer rooms on the 5th floor of 
the 500 Pearl Street courthouse beginning at 9:30am on April 13th. I will plan to be present and to continue assisting with 
logistics. If any questions or concerns arise, please feel free to call my cellphone at 
To assist in preparing for this review, attached please find annotated versions of the three evidence spreadsheets I 
previously emailed to you: (1) a spreadsheet of New York evidence; (2) a spreadsheet of Florida evidence; and (3) a more 
detailed spreadsheet of the sub-items contained in the Florida evidence spreadsheet. A couple things to note: 
• These spreadsheets now indicate the Protective Order designation, if any, for each item to be reviewed. As you will 
see, there are three mini-VHS tapes that I need to double check before assigning a final designation. I expect to be 
able to access a mini-VHS cassette player later this week, at which point I will be able to provide an updated 
spreadsheet with a confirmed designation for those three items. Additionally, please note that there is one item 
about which we plan to provide you with a letter later this week. 
• These spreadsheets also indicate where each item will be made available for the defense to review. As you will see, 
we have now learned that one item (consisting of shredded paper) is currently at FBI headquarters and will not be 
available for review next week. Please let me know if you believe you need to review that item, and I will inquire as 
to whether and how it can be relocated to New York. Additionally, all 1D items consist of electronic data (as 
opposed to 1B items, which are physical items). As is noted in the spreadsheets, the electronic data that constitute 
the 1D items in this case have either already been produced to you in discovery (e.g., pen register data, CPS data, 
and aerial footage), or are digital recordings of interviews that will be produced as non-testifying witness 
statements. Because these 1D items are data files stored in the FBI system, there is no corresponding physical item 
to produce for you to review. 
Please let me know when you would like to schedule a time for a smaller group from the defense team to review evidence 
at the Bronx warehouse.

Laura, 
Thank you for your email and for your understanding as we work through the logistics of arranging this review. Your 
modifications and clarifications are acceptable to us. Below I address each specifically: 
• The FBI can arrange for a lawyer, investigator, and paralegal to inspect and photograph the precluded items at the 
Bronx warehouse either next week or the week after. Please let us know what day you would like to arrange for 
that inspection, and I will coordinate with the FBI accordingly. I would suggest trying to schedule this visit early 
next week if possible so that if there are items that you believe need to be produced to 500 Pearl Street, we will 
have time to do so during a subsequent day of review at 500 Pearl if the FBI agrees to transport the item(s). 
• Tomorrow, I will send you evidence spreadsheets with annotations of which items the FBI will not be producing to 
500 Pearl Street, and which items we are designating under the Protective Order. Please note that certain items 
will be designated "Confidential," in which case they may be photographed, but the photographs should be treated 
as Confidential under the Protective Order. Other items will be designated "Highly Confidential," in which case they 
may not be photographed, absent specific authorization from an AUSA. I note the possibility of authorization to 
photograph this latter category because some Highly Confidential evidence items include both nude and non-nude 
portions, in which case we would permit photography of the non-nude portions. 
• In light of our decision to produce non-testifying witness statements beginning on April 12, 2021, we are no longer 
segregating any electronic media that contain witness statements during this review. This is because all of the 
witness statements on the electronic media in the FBI's possession are from witnesses whom the Government does 
not expect to call at trial in this case. Please note that we intend to produce digital audio files to you containing the 
contents of the electronic media with these non-testifying witness statements, but you are of course welcome to 
review the original recordings themselves. 
• In terms of space, I have been informed that we will not be permitted to conduct this review in a courtroom and 
will instead be required to do so in the proffer rooms. I have reserved the two largest proffer rooms available at 
500 Pearl. We can use the largest proffer room for evidence review, and the slightly smaller proffer room as a 
private meeting space for the defense team. 
• Confirmed, I will ask the FBI to bring all electronic highly confidential images to 500 Pearl Street, including the 
2,100 that were not previously reviewed and the electronic images that were previously provided for review at the 
MDC. 
• Confirmed, I will ask the FBI to bring the 7 hard-copy highly confidential materials to 500 Pearl Street. 
As I mentioned earlier today in a separate email, the FBI and AUSAs are prepared to facilitate this review beginning April 
13th and continuing every day thereafter until your review is complete. I have also formally requested that the Marshals 
produce Ms. Maxwell to 500 Pearl Street on April 13th and every day thereafter until the review is complete. The 
Marshals previously confirmed their willingness to produce Ms. Maxwell for such a review in general, but they have not 
yet confirmed their ability to do so on any particular dates. I will let you know as soon as the Marshals inform me 
whether they can accommodate these specific dates.

Subject: RE: US v. Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes 
Thank you for your email. Your proposal is largely acceptable to us, with the following modifications and clarifications. 
• For the items that you propose below to exclude from the evidence transported to 500 Pearl Street (with the 
exception of the cash held at 26 Federal Plaza), we will need to have access for a lawyer, investigator and paralegal 
to inspect and photograph those items at the Bronx warehouse. This seems to include the bulky items, electronic 
devices and "fragile" items. 
o Once they are photographed and shared with the team and our client, we can decide whether a separate 
inspection by our client and/or any expert is necessary at a later time. To be clear, the government's photos 
of these same items are insufficient. 
o If there are any items we are not permitted to photograph (and perhaps you will be able to tell us by April 5 
which those are), we likely will need to have those transported because there is no way for our client to 
inspect the evidence. We can wait to finalize this issue until you have finished deciding what items you 
consider non-photographable, and if we can't agree, then discuss next steps. 
o Please let us know when these "non-transportable" items can be inspected and photographed at the Bronx 
warehouse. It makes sense that it would be done soon so that we can raise any issues as necessary with the 
Court. 
• For playing any of the electronic media, we will obtain the necessary equipment to play at 500 Pearl Street and 
seek permission to bring those devices into the Courthouse. You can segregate out the section of recordings that 
contain "witness statements" and advise us then which ones cannot be played, but we still need to inspect the 
outside of those recordings. 
• As far as space, can you please advise whether the largest proffer room will be available for review of evidence? It 
is my understanding that it can accommodate a large number of the team members at one time. If not, is a locked 
courtroom available for us to review the evidence? The agents could bring out a limited number of boxes at a time 
for inspection. 
• We understand that the evidence will not be taken outside of the monitoring of the agents or your staff and 
appreciate that you will have a separate room for us to consult with our client privately (without the evidence). 
• We understand that all of the highly confidential materials, including not only the 2,100 images not previously 
disclosed as well as the electronic images that were only shown to NY counsel and the client at the MDC, will be 
available for review on a singular laptop at 500 Pearl Street. 
• We also understand the 7 hard-copy highly confidential materials will also be available for inspection at 500 Pearl 
Street. 
Please let me know if you have any questions or disagree with my understanding. If you agree, we can then proceed as 
scheduled on April 12 and continue day to day until we are finished, with a break if necessary for the arraignment.

Counsel, 
Thank you for your email. Below please find our response. If this is acceptable to you, then we will proceed with 
arranging the logistics of having your client produced to 500 Pearl the week of April 12th and the week April 19th. We will 
also arrange for the FBI to transport evidence to 500 Pearl for review the week of April 12th. 
Physical Evidence 
• It is not reasonable or feasible to insist that the FBI bring all physical evidence to 500 Pearl Street. That said, we are 
certainly willing to work with you to ensure that your client can review any physical items that are material to the 
preparation of her defense. 
• We would propose excluding the below items from production to 500 Pearl: 
o We appreciate your note that the massage tables are not needed, which will certainly help with the logistics 
of transport. 
o We also appreciate your indication that the cash items from 26 Federal Plaza do not need to be produced. 
Those are the only items not located in the Bronx warehouse. 
o The FBI has seized dozens of electronic devices, including desktop computers, servers, and laptops, from 
Jeffrey Epstein's residences in 2019. Photographs of those devices were produced in our August 2020 
productions as part of the search warrant photographs, and you have received copies of the data that was 
seized from those devices pursuant to a warrant. The production of these devices would be very 
cumbersome, and we do not see any value in looking at an electronic device that cannot be turned on. 
o The framed pictures are bulky and cumbersome to transport. These are also very delicate and are difficult 
to transport. Photographs of those seized images were already provided to you as part of the photographs 
from the searches of Epstein's residences. 
o Certain items seized from the New York residence are bulky, fragile, and/or difficult to transport. These 
include plaster busts of female torsos and a stuffed dog. Photographs of these items were already provided 
to you from the search of the New York residence. 
• The remaining physical items of evidence would fit into approximately 15 to 20 boxes. The FBI has indicated that it 
would be feasible to transport those boxes to 500 Pearl Street. 
• Regarding your request for equipment that can play the recordings, we believe they would require a VCR, a cassette 
player, a CD player, an adapter for a micro VHS tape, and a microcassette player. If you wish to play these 
recordings at 500 Pearl, you will need to provide that equipment. We have asked the FBI whether any other 
equipment would be necessary and will let you know if that is the case prior to the date of your review. It is our 
understanding that any recordings that are not witness statements and that are not highly confidential have been 
produced to you in discovery. We are not aware of any discoverable, non-highly confidential, recordings that were 
not produced to you as part of the Government's discovery productions in the fall. To confirm that understanding, 
we are working with the FBI to physically doublecheck each recording. If we identify any discoverable recordings 
that have not already been produced, we will promptly provide them to you. 
• The segregation of highly confidential material will require the FBI and an AUSA to physically review each item to 
confirm the item's status. We will endeavor to do so by your requested date of April 5, 2021. 
EFTA00026880
--- PAGE 10 ---
• We can confirm that neither the AUSA(s) nor the agent(s) will record or attempt to record any part of the evidence 
review or conversations among the defense team or with the defendant during this review. Although the evidence 
cannot be left outside of the presence of an agent, we will ensure that a room is available for the defense team and 
the defendant to confer privately away from the agent(s) and the AUSA(s) without monitoring. 
• As for your request for a space large enough to fit 8 members of the defense team, the defendant, an agent, an 
AUSA, and the evidence, my office cannot control the space that the Marshals allow us to use at 500 Pearl outside 
of the proffer rooms. We will certainly request as large a space as possible, but if we are required to use the 
proffer rooms, then members of the defense team may need to rotate in and out of the room. I know members of 
the defense team have been in those proffer rooms before, and they can hopefully provide some thoughts on how 
we might use the proffer room space effectively for your purposes. If the Court grants authorization for the 
defense to bring electronic devices into 500 Pearl, that is certainly fine with the Government, and you may note our 
consent in your request to Judge Nathan for such authorization. 
Highly Confidential Electronic Images 
. The 2,100 electronic images were recovered during the responsiveness review of images and videos seized from 
Jeffrey Epstein's devices, which review was not complete until early November 2020. We indicated on page 4 the 
cover letter to our November 9, 2020 production, which included all other images and videos from those devices, 
that "the Federal Bureau of Investigation ('FBI') seized multiple nude and partially nude images from several for the 
above-listed electronic devices. All such images have been designated Highly Confidential. The FBI will make these 
images available for review by the defense upon request." We did not receive a request from the defense to review 
these images until your March 8, 2021 letter, which requested to "view and inspect all materials designated by your 
office as 'Highly Confidential' under the terms of the Protective Order". 
• We did not ask the FBI to bring the 7 hard copy images to the MDC in the fall because we did not understand you to 
be requesting a review of physical, non-electronic evidence during those meetings. Our understanding of the 
defense request at that time was to review the electronic highly confidential images that were recovered from CDs 
from Epstein's residence. We will ensure that the 7 hard copy images are available to you for review at 500 Pearl.

Subject: RE: US v. Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes 
All, 
We have considered your proposal. Unfortunately, it does not permit us an adequate ability to review the evidence in the 
case and does not permit our client to meaningfully participate in her own defense. 
EFTA00026881
--- PAGE 11 ---
First, we are unable to meaningfully review the evidence without the benefit of our laptops and other electronic devices 
which are needed to take notes of our review. We also need access to our devices during the review to compare the 
physical evidence with the electronic discovery and with our work product. 
Second, we need to provide our client the ability to review all discovery, including any recordings, in order to assist in her 
own defense. Presuming that she will not be taken to the FBI downtown office, then your proposal offers no means by 
which she can both inspect a recording in its physical form and listen to the recording at the same time. 
In order to address the deficiencies in your proposal, we believe the following are necessary: 
Physical Evidence 
• All of the physical evidence currently located in the FBI Bronx warehouse will be transported to 500 Pearl Street 
and made available during the week of April 12, with our client present, in a room sufficiently large to 
accommodate 8 attorneys and investigators. 
o We do not need the "bulky" massage tables transported; if there are any other extremely large evidence 
pieces, let us know what they are and we can consider whether we can have someone review and 
photograph those at the Bronx warehouse at an earlier time. 
o From your email, it appears that only two items are not located at the Bronx warehouse — both envelopes 
with cash. Please confirm this. We do not need the two "cash" evidence items transported to 500 Pearl. 
o If there are other evidence items housed somewhere other than the Bronx, please let us know what they are 
and where they are. 
• We will be permitted to bring our laptops, and a camera, into 500 Pearl Street; we are happy to seek permission 
from Judge Nathan to do so. 
• Either the FBI can provide the equipment necessary to listen to any of the recordings at 500 Pearl Street or we can 
bring the necessary equipment. If we are to provide the equipment, we will need to know in advance the formats 
of each recording so that we can be prepared. You can note that on your Excel spreadsheet by the item number by 
March 29 to give us adequate time to secure the necessary equipment. 
• The FBI can segregate any physical evidence that you deem "highly confidential." You can identify any "highly 
confidential" physical evidence items on your Excel spreadsheets by April 5 (one week before the evidence view). If 
we need to photograph or reproduce any such item for expert evaluation, we will seek leave of court. Otherwise, 
we will not photograph any such items during the review during the week of April 12. This will ensure the evidence 
review proceeds smoothly and there will not be any need to ask permission to photograph on an item by item 
basis. 
• The FBI also can segregate any recordings which we will be able to inspect, but not listen to, during the evidence 
view the week of April 12. You can note such designation on your Excel spreadsheet. If we disagree, we can seek 
leave of the Court in advance. 
• We understand that an FBI Agent and/or AUSA may be present during our physical evidence review at 500 Pearl 
Street but of course must ensure that no recordings are made of our conversations and also ensure that there is a 
separate, secure room in which we can confer with our client during the evidence view without monitoring by the 
government. 
• Please confirm whether all electronic recordings (other than the highly-confidential images and videos described 
below) have previously been produced to us, and if not, please explain which ones were not produced by the 
discovery deadlines last fall and why. 
Highly Confidential Electronic Evidence 
• Can you please explain why 2,100 + 7 "highly confidential" images have not been shared with us yet? It was our 
understanding that you previously provided all "highly confidential" images to our client — and to defense counsel —
for review at the MDC in November. We are confused about where these previously undisclosed items were 
located and why they have not yet been made available for inspection and review. 
• During the week of April 19, Ms. Maxwell should be produced to 500 Pearl Street to review (with counsel and a 
defense staff member, on the 1 laptop provided) all of the 5,507 electronic images and video marked "highly 
confidential". These should be segregated into the three categories you describe (never-before produced, 
previously produced, and the 7 hard-copy images). 
EFTA00026882

Please let us know if you will not agree to any of these steps so that we can address the issues with the Court. 
Thank you.

Subject: RE: US v. Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes 
All, 
Attached please find two spreadsheets documenting all physical evidence in the FBI's custody, as well as a corresponding 
discovery cover letter. We are sending a copy of these files to the MDC for your client as well. 
In response to your questions, the FBI has informed me of the following: 
Regarding the Highly Confidential nude/partially nudge images to be reviewed at 500 Pearl: 
• There are three categories of these images: 
o Approximately 2,100 electronic images and videos seized from Epstein's electronic devices (which have not 
been previously provided to you) 
o Approximately 3,400 electronic images from discs seized from Epstein's residences in 2019 (which have 
previously been provided to you and your client for review at the MDC) 
o Approximately 7 hard copy nude images located in the file from the FBI Florida office's investigation of 
Epstein (which have not been previously provided to you) 
• The FBI will make all three of those categories available to you. The electronic files will be provided on hard drives, 
and the FBI will provide you with the hard copy images for review as well. 
o All electronic images should be viewable as thumbnails, except those seized from Apple devices, which must 
be viewed using Cellebrite. 
o The Cellebrite software will be provided on the drive for your review of images and videos seized from Apple 
devices. 
o The electronic files have the same metadata on the hard drive that was available when the FBI seized each 
image. For images that were carved or deleted, no metadata was recovered, so none is viewable. For all 
other images, the metadata recovered should be viewable on the hard drive. 
o The approximately 2,100 electronic images and videos seized from Epstein's devices are separated by folder 
to indicate which device each image was seized from. 
• Because these images are considered obscene material, the FBI is not permitted to make duplicates of them, and 
there is a limited number of clean laptops on which these images can be reviewed. As a result, the FBI is only able 
to provide a single laptop for review of these images. 
Regarding the physical evidence: 
• Attached are two lists of all physical items in the FBI's custody relating to this case. The first list relates to items 
associated with the FBI Florida office's investigation of Epstein. The second list relates to items associated with the 
FBI New York office's current investigation. 
• The vast majority of physical evidence in the FBI's custody is located at the FBI's warehouse in the Bronx. Two 
items (18 77 & 1B 79) are located at 26 Federal Plaza, but the case agents can check those items out from 26 
EFTA00026883
--- PAGE 13 ---
Federal Plaza and bring them to the Bronx warehouse on whatever day you choose to conduct your review so that 
you will have all evidence in one place. 
• The FBI is able to arrange for the defense team to review all physical evidence at the Bronx warehouse under the 
following conditions: 
o The warehouse requires at least two weeks' notice in order to pull all of the items for the entire case and 
place them in a location where a large group of people can view them. 
o The warehouse is open during normal business hours between 9am and 5pm on weekdays. 
o At least two FBI agents and an AUSA will be present at the Bronx warehouse to assist and answer questions. 
o The evidence will be placed in a loading dock at the warehouse to provide additional space for the review. 
To ensure that there is sufficient space, please let me know how many members of the defense team intend 
to be physically present for this review. 
o Electronic devices such as cellphones and laptops are not permitted in the warehouse. The defense team 
may bring a digital camera that is not connected to the Internet or a cellular network into the warehouse. If 
the defense team wishes to photograph an item of evidence, the defense will need to inform the agents who 
are present, so that they may confirm that the photographed item is not Highly Confidential based on the 
presence of nudity. 
o Electronic media such as VHS tapes, cassette tapes, and CDs will not be playable at the warehouse. 
• To the extent the defense requests that the FBI bring any physical items to 500 Pearl Street for your client to review, 
the FBI is prepared to bring items that are reasonably sized to 500 Pearl Street. With respect to bulky or large 
items, the defense team should be able to photograph those for your client to review, unless they are deemed 
Highly Confidential, in which case the FBI can make arrangements to transport the item to 500 Pearl Street if 
necessary. 
• The FBI is in the process of confirming that it can provide devices to play all of the electronic media in the case in a 
single location at the FBI's offices in downtown Manhattan. We are also double-checking to confirm that all media 
that does not contain witness statements have already been produced to you and your client in discovery. The FBI 
anticipates that we can arrange for you to review all non-witness statement electronic media at the FBI's office in 
downtown Manhattan in approximately three weeks. 
o To the extent you wish to review all of the discs containing photographs, which were seized from Epstein's 
residences in 2019, we note that all of those images have already been produced to you in discovery. For 
your awareness, the FBI has informed me that it took their team several weeks to review all of the images on 
all of those discs. 
Please let me know how you wish to proceed.

Now that the FBI team is back, when do you expect to have answers to all of the questions posed? If I had an idea of 
when you would have answers, it could help me answer your question. 
At a minimum, it would not seem to take too much time to know when someone can open the FBI vault and allow the 
attorneys to make an initial view of the evidence. Also, I understand the FBI did not prepare an inventory of their 
evidence when they seized it from NY and LSJ, so I don't think we need to wait for them to now prepare an inventory 
before we start reviewing evidence. 
Also, when do you believe you will have a response regarding the discovery I requested last Monday? 
Thanks, 
Laura

Counsel, 
The FBI team on this case has been out of the office this week and will not be able to answer all of the questions you 
asked during our Wednesday call until they are back in the office next week. Please let me know if you would like to wait 
until all of those questions can be answered to schedule a day for your client to be brought to 500 Pearl Street to review 
the highly confidential images. My understanding is that the FBI is able to provide at least one laptop containing those 
highly confidential images in time for such a review to take place on Thursday 5/18, but I may not have the answers to all 
of your questions about those images before that date, and I do not know whether you will also be able to visit the 
evidence vault that same week. 
Please let me know how you would like to proceed. I will reach back out once I have answers to your questions.

That is the only excel spreadsheet indexing physical evidence that we have produced in discovery. That spreadsheet does 
not include every physical item currently in the FBI's custody related to this case. For example, the August 20, 2020 
discovery production also included search warrant returns listing the physical items seized by the FBI's New York Office 
during the 2019 searches of Jeffrey Epstein's residences in New York and the U.S Virgin Islands (see Bates range 
SDNY_GM_00166007-SDNY_GM_00166043), but they are not contained in a spreadsheet. 
As a courtesy, I have asked the FBI whether it would be possible to provide us with a similar excel index reflecting the 
physical evidence seized by the FBI's New York Office, though it may take some time to compile such an index.

Counsel, 
In advance of our call tomorrow, I wanted to send a copy of the attached index of physical items in FBI custody from the 
FBI-Miami office, which we previously produced to you as part of our August 21, 2020 discovery production. Also 
included in that August 21, 2020 production were scans of numerous items listed on the index. Those scans can be found 
within Bates range SDNY_GM_00172218-SDNY_GM_00173007. It may be useful to reference some of those items during 
our conversation tomorrow, so I wanted to make sure you were aware of them.

All, 
Today the Marshals and the FBI informed me that they are able to arrange for your client and the evidence to be at 500 
Pearl in time for the review to start as early as 8am each morning of the review period. The review can still continue until 
4:30pm each day. In order to take advantage of the extra time, I would propose planning to begin each review day at 
8:30am. You would also be welcome to arrive as early at 8am, and if the Marshals and FBI are ready to begin before 8:30, 
then we can do so. I will plan to be at 500 Pearl by 8am each morning. 
Also, the CSOs have asked for a list of everyone from the defense team who should be granted access into the proffer area 
on the fifth floor of 500 Pearl for the review. Would you please send me a list of the names of everyone who you expect 
to attend the review? 
Thank you,

Laura, 
Below please find responses to the issues you raised: 
• We are confirmed for the review at the Bronx warehouse on April 12, 2021 from 11am to 4:30pm. 
• During the April 12th review, your team can see the evidence for yourselves and let me know if you need any of the 
items you are not permitted to photograph to be brought to 500 Pearl. Depending on the size of the item(s), we 
may need to figure out whether they can be brought later in the week once you have already reviewed several 
boxes, which would free up space in the FBI vehicle for the larger items. I'm confident we will be able to reach a 
reasonable agreement about those items. 
• For the bulky photos, you will not be permitted to photograph any that feature nudity. As referenced above, once 
your team has seen those photos for yourselves, you can let me know if you will need any to be brought to 500 
Pearl. 
EFTA00026891
--- PAGE 3 ---
• As I mentioned previously and is indicated in the spreadsheet, we are preparing a letter to defense counsel 
explaining why you will not be permitted to review those 16 discs. We expect to send you that letter tomorrow, 
after which I will be happy to discuss the matter further. 
• The blue-ray discs referenced in the spreadsheet are what the FBI burned in order to provide the USAO SDNY with 
a copy of electronic data to produce to you in discovery. The discs are not evidence themselves. The data is the 
evidence, and it was produced to you already. You are correct, however, that the 4/24/07 file is a data file that was 
copied from a VHS tape, which is currently located in the FBI's ELSUR office in Florida. We have asked that the 
original tape be shipped to New York, and it should arrive on Tuesday, April 13th. We will make it available for you 
to review once we have received it. We also plan to produce the digital file of that same recording to you as part of 
our productions of non-testifying witness statements. 
• The shredded paper is currently being analyzed by the FBI lab. We have asked the case agent to inquire with the 
lab regarding its anticipated timeline for analysis and will let you know when we expect it will be possible to have 
the shredded paper returned to New York for you to review. It will not, however, be available next week. 
• The "Missing from Assigned Box" items are items 16130 and 16110. Those items were migrated within the FBI 
evidence system from the Florida case to the New York case and incorporated into New York evidence item 
numbers 1B127, 16128, & 16137. So these items will be available for your review under those New York evidence 
numbers.

My apologies, I meant to include in my previous email that we could have the Bronx view on Monday April 12. Thank you 
for the logistics. 
Regarding the spreadsheets you provided, I have several issues. 
First, there are a couple of items that you have noted for the Bronx Warehouse but will in fact need to be brought to 500 
Pearl for review because you labeled them as "Highly Confidential" and not "bulky." These appear to include: 
EFTA00026892
--- PAGE 4 ---
NY Evidence List 
• Items 16127-130 (4 boxes). 
• Item 1B13 (1 box) 
Florida Evidence List 
. Item 1, Subitem 26 — one large framed photo from Master Bedroom. 
Second, with regard to the "Bulky" photos (Florida Items 1, Subitems 8, 15a, 15b and 15c), are we permitted to 
photograph those or not? If not, we will need them transported to 500 Pearl. 
Third, Florida Item 8, Subitem 8, says it is Sixteen DVD-R Discs from PBSO but you do not indicate that we can review 
those. Why? We need to address with the Court promptly any issues related to our request to view all evidence. 
Fourth, Electronic surveillance — Your email yesterday stated that these were all "electronic files" with no corresponding 
physical item. However, for several, the chart indicates "Blu-Ray Disks;" is there a reason we cannot inspect these? 
Another Florida item is listed as "one original recording of an interview dated 4/24/07"; I am suspicious that "one original 
recording of an interview" is not truly only an "electronic" file? I was practicing law in 2007 and do not recall "electronic 
files" being the standard then. Can you please confirm? I know that Chris has written separately about the many files for 
which the metadata has apparently been stripped, so we will have to address purely electronic information at another 
date. 
Shredded Paper — Yes, we need to review that as well. 
"Missing from Assigned Box" items — can you please provide more of an explanation for all "missing items"? 
I will let you know any other issues as I see them. However, now that we have made travel plans in reliance on your 
agreement to produce all evidence items, I am hoping that you can promptly answer these questions so that we can 
resolve any of them as needed this week. 
Thank you,

Hi Laura, 
The Bronx warehouse is located at 2350 Lafayette Ave, Bronx, NY. There is plenty of street parking outside of the 
building. Whatever day you wish to have the review conducted at the warehouse, an AUSA and an agent will meet the 
attorney, investigator, and paralegal at the warehouse to escort them into the building to the evidence review room. The 
AUSA will remain present at the warehouse to answer any questions that may arise. 
EFTA00026893
--- PAGE 5 ---
The FBI has informed me that they can make the evidence available for review at the warehouse any day next week or the 
week of April 19th. Please just let me know what day you prefer, and we will coordinate with the FBI to arrange for the 
review.

VHS tapes that I referenced below.

I learned this morning that the Marshals intend to bring Ms. Maxwell back to the MDC each review day at 4:30pm. So we 
can plan for the review to take place at 500 Pearl Street from 9:30am to 4:30pm each day beginning on April 13th.

Subject: RE: US v. Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (A1N) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes 
Good evening, 
Today, the Marshals confirmed that they will produce Ms. Maxwell to 500 Pearl Street on April 13, 2021 and every day 
thereafter until the evidence review is complete. My understanding is that Ms. Maxwell should arrive to 500 Pearl Street 
at approximately 9:30am each morning. So we are confirmed for evidence review in the proffer rooms on the 5th floor of 
the 500 Pearl Street courthouse beginning at 9:30am on April 13th. I will plan to be present and to continue assisting with 
logistics. If any questions or concerns arise, please feel free to call my cellphone at 
To assist in preparing for this review, attached please find annotated versions of the three evidence spreadsheets I 
previously emailed to you: (1) a spreadsheet of New York evidence; (2) a spreadsheet of Florida evidence; and (3) a more 
detailed spreadsheet of the sub-items contained in the Florida evidence spreadsheet. A couple things to note: 
• These spreadsheets now indicate the Protective Order designation, if any, for each item to be reviewed. As you will 
see, there are three mini-VHS tapes that I need to double check before assigning a final designation. I expect to be 
able to access a mini-VHS cassette player later this week, at which point I will be able to provide an updated 
spreadsheet with a confirmed designation for those three items. Additionally, please note that there is one item 
about which we plan to provide you with a letter later this week. 
• These spreadsheets also indicate where each item will be made available for the defense to review. As you will see, 
we have now learned that one item (consisting of shredded paper) is currently at FBI headquarters and will not be 
available for review next week. Please let me know if you believe you need to review that item, and I will inquire as 
to whether and how it can be relocated to New York. Additionally, all 1D items consist of electronic data (as 
opposed to 1B items, which are physical items). As is noted in the spreadsheets, the electronic data that constitute 
the 1D items in this case have either already been produced to you in discovery (e.g., pen register data, GPS data, 
and aerial footage), or are digital recordings of interviews that will be produced as non-testifying witness 
statements. Because these 1D items are data files stored in the FBI system, there is no corresponding physical item 
to produce for you to review. 
Please let me know when you would like to schedule a time for a smaller group from the defense team to review evidence 
at the Bronx warehouse.

Laura, 
Thank you for your email and for your understanding as we work through the logistics of arranging this review. Your 
modifications and clarifications are acceptable to us. Below I address each specifically: 
• The FBI can arrange for a lawyer, investigator, and paralegal to inspect and photograph the precluded items at the 
Bronx warehouse either next week or the week after. Please let us know what day you would like to arrange for 
that inspection, and I will coordinate with the FBI accordingly. I would suggest trying to schedule this visit early 
next week if possible so that if there are items that you believe need to be produced to 500 Pearl Street, we will 
have time to do so during a subsequent day of review at 500 Pearl if the FBI agrees to transport the item(s). 
• Tomorrow, I will send you evidence spreadsheets with annotations of which items the FBI will not be producing to 
500 Pearl Street, and which items we are designating under the Protective Order. Please note that certain items 
will be designated "Confidential," in which case they may be photographed, but the photographs should be treated 
as Confidential under the Protective Order. Other items will be designated "Highly Confidential," in which case they 
may not be photographed, absent specific authorization from an AUSA. I note the possibility of authorization to 
photograph this latter category because some Highly Confidential evidence items include both nude and non-nude 
portions, in which case we would permit photography of the non-nude portions. 
• In light of our decision to produce non-testifying witness statements beginning on April 12, 2021, we are no longer 
segregating any electronic media that contain witness statements during this review. This is because all of the 
witness statements on the electronic media in the FBI's possession are from witnesses whom the Government does 
not expect to call at trial in this case. Please note that we intend to produce digital audio files to you containing the 
contents of the electronic media with these non-testifying witness statements, but you are of course welcome to 
review the original recordings themselves. 
• In terms of space, I have been informed that we will not be permitted to conduct this review in a courtroom and 
will instead be required to do so in the proffer rooms. I have reserved the two largest proffer rooms available at 
500 Pearl. We can use the largest proffer room for evidence review, and the slightly smaller proffer room as a 
private meeting space for the defense team. 
• Confirmed, I will ask the FBI to bring all electronic highly confidential images to 500 Pearl Street, including the 
2,100 that were not previously reviewed and the electronic images that were previously provided for review at the 
MDC. 
• Confirmed, I will ask the FBI to bring the 7 hard-copy highly confidential materials to 500 Pearl Street. 
EFTA00026896
--- PAGE 8 ---
As I mentioned earlier today in a separate email, the FBI and AUSAs are prepared to facilitate this review beginning April 
13th and continuing every day thereafter until your review is complete. I have also formally requested that the Marshals 
produce Ms. Maxwell to 500 Pearl Street on April 13th and every day thereafter until the review is complete. The 
Marshals previously confirmed their willingness to produce Ms. Maxwell for such a review in general, but they have not 
yet confirmed their ability to do so on any particular dates. I will let you know as soon as the Marshals inform me 
whether they can accommodate these specific dates.

Subject: RE: US v. Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes 
Thank you for your email. Your proposal is largely acceptable to us, with the following modifications and clarifications. 
• For the items that you propose below to exclude from the evidence transported to 500 Pearl Street (with the 
exception of the cash held at 26 Federal Plaza), we will need to have access for a lawyer, investigator and paralegal 
to inspect and photograph those items at the Bronx warehouse. This seems to include the bulky items, electronic 
devices and "fragile" items. 
o Once they are photographed and shared with the team and our client, we can decide whether a separate 
inspection by our client and/or any expert is necessary at a later time. To be clear, the government's photos 
of these same items are insufficient. 
o If there are any items we are not permitted to photograph (and perhaps you will be able to tell us by April 5 
which those are), we likely will need to have those transported because there is no way for our client to 
inspect the evidence. We can wait to finalize this issue until you have finished deciding what items you 
consider non-photographable, and if we can't agree, then discuss next steps. 
o Please let us know when these "non-transportable" items can be inspected and photographed at the Bronx 
warehouse. It makes sense that it would be done soon so that we can raise any issues as necessary with the 
Court. 
• For playing any of the electronic media, we will obtain the necessary equipment to play at 500 Pearl Street and 
seek permission to bring those devices into the Courthouse. You can segregate out the section of recordings that 
contain "witness statements" and advise us then which ones cannot be played, but we still need to inspect the 
outside of those recordings. 
• As far as space, can you please advise whether the largest proffer room will be available for review of evidence? It 
is my understanding that it can accommodate a large number of the team members at one time. If not, is a locked 
courtroom available for us to review the evidence? The agents could bring out a limited number of boxes at a time 
for inspection. 
EFTA00026897
--- PAGE 9 ---
• We understand that the evidence will not be taken outside of the monitoring of the agents or your staff and 
appreciate that you will have a separate room for us to consult with our client privately (without the evidence). 
• We understand that all of the highly confidential materials, including not only the 2,100 images not previously 
disclosed as well as the electronic images that were only shown to NY counsel and the client at the MDC, will be 
available for review on a singular laptop at 500 Pearl Street. 
• We also understand the 7 hard-copy highly confidential materials will also be available for inspection at 500 Pearl 
Street. 
Please let me know if you have any questions or disagree with my understanding. If you agree, we can then proceed as 
scheduled on April 12 and continue day to day until we are finished, with a break if necessary for the arraignment.

Subject: RE: US v. Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes 
Counsel, 
Thank you for your email. Below please find our response. If this is acceptable to you, then we will proceed with 
arranging the logistics of having your client produced to 500 Pearl the week of April 12th and the week April 19th. We will 
also arrange for the FBI to transport evidence to 500 Pearl for review the week of April 12th. 
Physical Evidence 
• It is not reasonable or feasible to insist that the FBI bring all physical evidence to 500 Pearl Street. That said, we are 
certainly willing to work with you to ensure that your client can review any physical items that are material to the 
preparation of her defense. 
• We would propose excluding the below items from production to 500 Pearl: 
o We appreciate your note that the massage tables are not needed, which will certainly help with the logistics 
of transport. 
o We also appreciate your indication that the cash items from 26 Federal Plaza do not need to be produced. 
Those are the only items not located in the Bronx warehouse. 
o The FBI has seized dozens of electronic devices, including desktop computers, servers, and laptops, from 
Jeffrey Epstein's residences in 2019. Photographs of those devices were produced in our August 2020 
productions as part of the search warrant photographs, and you have received copies of the data that was 
seized from those devices pursuant to a warrant. The production of these devices would be very 
cumbersome, and we do not see any value in looking at an electronic device that cannot be turned on. 
o The framed pictures are bulky and cumbersome to transport. These are also very delicate and are difficult 
to transport. Photographs of those seized images were already provided to you as part of the photographs 
from the searches of Epstein's residences. 
o Certain items seized from the New York residence are bulky, fragile, and/or difficult to transport. These 
include plaster busts of female torsos and a stuffed dog. Photographs of these items were already provided 
to you from the search of the New York residence. 
EFTA00026898
--- PAGE 10 ---
• The remaining physical items of evidence would fit into approximately 15 to 20 boxes. The FBI has indicated that it 
would be feasible to transport those boxes to 500 Pearl Street. 
• Regarding your request for equipment that can play the recordings, we believe they would require a VCR, a cassette 
player, a CD player, an adapter for a micro VHS tape, and a microcassette player. If you wish to play these 
recordings at 500 Pearl, you will need to provide that equipment. We have asked the FBI whether any other 
equipment would be necessary and will let you know if that is the case prior to the date of your review. It is our 
understanding that any recordings that are not witness statements and that are not highly confidential have been 
produced to you in discovery. We are not aware of any discoverable, non-highly confidential, recordings that were 
not produced to you as part of the Government's discovery productions in the fall. To confirm that understanding, 
we are working with the FBI to physically doublecheck each recording. If we identify any discoverable recordings 
that have not already been produced, we will promptly provide them to you. 
• The segregation of highly confidential material will require the FBI and an AUSA to physically review each item to 
confirm the item's status. We will endeavor to do so by your requested date of April 5, 2021. 
• We can confirm that neither the AUSA(s) nor the agent(s) will record or attempt to record any part of the evidence 
review or conversations among the defense team or with the defendant during this review. Although the evidence 
cannot be left outside of the presence of an agent, we will ensure that a room is available for the defense team and 
the defendant to confer privately away from the agent(s) and the AUSA(s) without monitoring. 
• As for your request for a space large enough to fit 8 members of the defense team, the defendant, an agent, an 
AUSA, and the evidence, my office cannot control the space that the Marshals allow us to use at 500 Pearl outside 
of the proffer rooms. We will certainly request as large a space as possible, but if we are required to use the 
proffer rooms, then members of the defense team may need to rotate in and out of the room. I know members of 
the defense team have been in those proffer rooms before, and they can hopefully provide some thoughts on how 
we might use the proffer room space effectively for your purposes. If the Court grants authorization for the 
defense to bring electronic devices into 500 Pearl, that is certainly fine with the Government, and you may note our 
consent in your request to Judge Nathan for such authorization. 
Highly Confidential Electronic Images 
• The 2,100 electronic images were recovered during the responsiveness review of images and videos seized from 
Jeffrey Epstein's devices, which review was not complete until early November 2020. We indicated on page 4 the 
cover letter to our November 9, 2020 production, which included all other images and videos from those devices, 
that "the Federal Bureau of Investigation ('FBI') seized multiple nude and partially nude images from several for the 
above-listed electronic devices. All such images have been designated Highly Confidential. The FBI will make these 
images available for review by the defense upon request." We did not receive a request from the defense to review 
these images until your March 8, 2021 letter, which requested to "view and inspect all materials designated by your 
office as 'Highly Confidential' under the terms of the Protective Order". 
• We did not ask the FBI to bring the 7 hard copy images to the MDC in the fall because we did not understand you to 
be requesting a review of physical, non-electronic evidence during those meetings. Our understanding of the 
defense request at that time was to review the electronic highly confidential images that were recovered from CDs 
from Epstein's residence. We will ensure that the 7 hard copy images are available to you for review at 500 Pearl.

Subject: RE: US v. Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes 
All, 
We have considered your proposal. Unfortunately, it does not permit us an adequate ability to review the evidence in the 
case and does not permit our client to meaningfully participate in her own defense. 
First, we are unable to meaningfully review the evidence without the benefit of our laptops and other electronic devices 
which are needed to take notes of our review. We also need access to our devices during the review to compare the 
physical evidence with the electronic discovery and with our work product. 
Second, we need to provide our client the ability to review all discovery, including any recordings, in order to assist in her 
own defense. Presuming that she will not be taken to the FBI downtown office, then your proposal offers no means by 
which she can both inspect a recording in its physical form and listen to the recording at the same time. 
In order to address the deficiencies in your proposal, we believe the following are necessary: 
Physical Evidence 
• All of the physical evidence currently located in the FBI Bronx warehouse will be transported to 500 Pearl Street 
and made available during the week of April 12, with our client present, in a room sufficiently large to 
accommodate 8 attorneys and investigators. 
o We do not need the "bulky" massage tables transported; if there are any other extremely large evidence 
pieces, let us know what they are and we can consider whether we can have someone review and 
photograph those at the Bronx warehouse at an earlier time. 
o From your email, it appears that only two items are not located at the Bronx warehouse — both envelopes 
with cash. Please confirm this. We do not need the two "cash" evidence items transported to 500 Pearl. 
o If there are other evidence items housed somewhere other than the Bronx, please let us know what they are 
and where they are. 
• We will be permitted to bring our laptops, and a camera, into 500 Pearl Street; we are happy to seek permission 
from Judge Nathan to do so. 
• Either the FBI can provide the equipment necessary to listen to any of the recordings at 500 Pearl Street or we can 
bring the necessary equipment. If we are to provide the equipment, we will need to know in advance the formats 
of each recording so that we can be prepared. You can note that on your Excel spreadsheet by the item number by 
March 29 to give us adequate time to secure the necessary equipment. 
• The FBI can segregate any physical evidence that you deem "highly confidential." You can identify any "highly 
confidential" physical evidence items on your Excel spreadsheets by April 5 (one week before the evidence view). If 
we need to photograph or reproduce any such item for expert evaluation, we will seek leave of court. Otherwise, 
we will not photograph any such items during the review during the week of April 12. This will ensure the evidence 
review proceeds smoothly and there will not be any need to ask permission to photograph on an item by item 
basis. 
• The FBI also can segregate any recordings which we will be able to inspect, but not listen to, during the evidence 
view the week of April 12. You can note such designation on your Excel spreadsheet. If we disagree, we can seek 
leave of the Court in advance. 
• We understand that an FBI Agent and/or AUSA may be present during our physical evidence review at 500 Pearl 
Street but of course must ensure that no recordings are made of our conversations and also ensure that there is a 
EFTA00026900
--- PAGE 12 ---
separate, secure room in which we can confer with our client during the evidence view without monitoring by the 
government. 
• Please confirm whether all electronic recordings (other than the highly-confidential images and videos described 
below) have previously been produced to us, and if not, please explain which ones were not produced by the 
discovery deadlines last fall and why. 
Highly Confidential Electronic Evidence 
• Can you please explain why 2,100 + 7 "highly confidential" images have not been shared with us yet? It was our 
understanding that you previously provided all "highly confidential" images to our client — and to defense counsel —
for review at the MDC in November. We are confused about where these previously undisclosed items were 
located and why they have not yet been made available for inspection and review. 
• During the week of April 19, Ms. Maxwell should be produced to 500 Pearl Street to review (with counsel and a 
defense staff member, on the 1 laptop provided) all of the 5,507 electronic images and video marked "highly 
confidential". These should be segregated into the three categories you describe (never-before produced, 
previously produced, and the 7 hard-copy images). 
Please let us know if you will not agree to any of these steps so that we can address the issues with the Court. 
Thank you.

Subject: RE: US v. Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes 
All, 
Attached please find two spreadsheets documenting all physical evidence in the FBI's custody, as well as a corresponding 
discovery cover letter. We are sending a copy of these files to the MDC for your client as well. 
In response to your questions, the FBI has informed me of the following: 
Regarding the Highly Confidential nude/partially nudge images to be reviewed at 500 Pearl: 
• There are three categories of these images: 
o Approximately 2,100 electronic images and videos seized from Epstein's electronic devices (which have not 
been previously provided to you) 
o Approximately 3,400 electronic images from discs seized from Epstein's residences in 2019 (which have 
previously been provided to you and your client for review at the MDC) 
o Approximately 7 hard copy nude images located in the file from the FBI Florida office's investigation of 
Epstein (which have not been previously provided to you) 
• The FBI will make all three of those categories available to you. The electronic files will be provided on hard drives, 
and the FBI will provide you with the hard copy images for review as well. 
o All electronic images should be viewable as thumbnails, except those seized from Apple devices, which must 
be viewed using Cellebrite. 
o The Cellebrite software will be provided on the drive for your review of images and videos seized from Apple 
devices. 
EFTA00026901
--- PAGE 13 ---
o The electronic files have the same metadata on the hard drive that was available when the FBI seized each 
image. For images that were carved or deleted, no metadata was recovered, so none is viewable. For all 
other images, the metadata recovered should be viewable on the hard drive. 
o The approximately 2,100 electronic images and videos seized from Epstein's devices are separated by folder 
to indicate which device each image was seized from. 
• Because these images are considered obscene material, the FBI is not permitted to make duplicates of them, and 
there is a limited number of clean laptops on which these images can be reviewed. As a result, the FBI is only able 
to provide a single laptop for review of these images. 
Regarding the physical evidence: 
• Attached are two lists of all physical items in the FBI's custody relating to this case. The first list relates to items 
associated with the FBI Florida office's investigation of Epstein. The second list relates to items associated with the 
FBI New York office's current investigation. 
• The vast majority of physical evidence in the FBI's custody is located at the FBI's warehouse in the Bronx. Two 
items (18 77 & 1B 79) are located at 26 Federal Plaza, but the case agents can check those items out from 26 
Federal Plaza and bring them to the Bronx warehouse on whatever day you choose to conduct your review so that 
you will have all evidence in one place. 
• The FBI is able to arrange for the defense team to review all physical evidence at the Bronx warehouse under the 
following conditions: 
o The warehouse requires at least two weeks' notice in order to pull all of the items for the entire case and 
place them in a location where a large group of people can view them. 
o The warehouse is open during normal business hours between 9am and 5pm on weekdays. 
o At least two FBI agents and an AUSA will be present at the Bronx warehouse to assist and answer questions. 
o The evidence will be placed in a loading dock at the warehouse to provide additional space for the review. 
To ensure that there is sufficient space, please let me know how many members of the defense team intend 
to be physically present for this review. 
o Electronic devices such as cellphones and laptops are not permitted in the warehouse. The defense team 
may bring a digital camera that is not connected to the Internet or a cellular network into the warehouse. If 
the defense team wishes to photograph an item of evidence, the defense will need to inform the agents who 
are present, so that they may confirm that the photographed item is not Highly Confidential based on the 
presence of nudity. 
o Electronic media such as VHS tapes, cassette tapes, and CDs will not be playable at the warehouse. 
• To the extent the defense requests that the FBI bring any physical items to 500 Pearl Street for your client to review, 
the FBI is prepared to bring items that are reasonably sized to 500 Pearl Street. With respect to bulky or large 
items, the defense team should be able to photograph those for your client to review, unless they are deemed 
Highly Confidential, in which case the FBI can make arrangements to transport the item to 500 Pearl Street if 
necessary. 
• The FBI is in the process of confirming that it can provide devices to play all of the electronic media in the case in a 
single location at the FBI's offices in downtown Manhattan. We are also double-checking to confirm that all media 
that does not contain witness statements have already been produced to you and your client in discovery. The FBI 
anticipates that we can arrange for you to review all non-witness statement electronic media at the FBI's office in 
downtown Manhattan in approximately three weeks. 
o To the extent you wish to review all of the discs containing photographs, which were seized from Epstein's 
residences in 2019, we note that all of those images have already been produced to you in discovery. For 
your awareness, the FBI has informed me that it took their team several weeks to review all of the images on 
all of those discs. 
Please let me know how you wish to proceed. 
Best, 
Assistant United States Attorney

Now that the FBI team is back, when do you expect to have answers to all of the questions posed? If I had an idea of 
when you would have answers, it could help me answer your question. 
At a minimum, it would not seem to take too much time to know when someone can open the FBI vault and allow the 
attorneys to make an initial view of the evidence. Also, I understand the FBI did not prepare an inventory of their 
evidence when they seized it from NY and LSJ, so I don't think we need to wait for them to now prepare an inventory 
before we start reviewing evidence.

The FBI team on this case has been out of the office this week and will not be able to answer all of the questions you 
asked during our Wednesday call until they are back in the office next week. Please let me know if you would like to wait 
until all of those questions can be answered to schedule a day for your client to be brought to 500 Pearl Street to review 
the highly confidential images. My understanding is that the FBI is able to provide at least one laptop containing those 
highly confidential images in time for such a review to take place on Thursday 5/18, but I may not have the answers to all 
of your questions about those images before that date, and I do not know whether you will also be able to visit the 
evidence vault that same week. 
Please let me know how you would like to proceed. I will reach back out once I have answers to your questions.

That is the only excel spreadsheet indexing physical evidence that we have produced in discovery. That spreadsheet does 
not include every physical item currently in the FBI's custody related to this case. For example, the August 20, 2020 
discovery production also included search warrant returns listing the physical items seized by the FBI's New York Office 
during the 2019 searches of Jeffrey Epstein's residences in New York and the U.S Virgin Islands (see Bates range 
SDNY_GM_00166007-SDNY_GM_00166043), but they are not contained in a spreadsheet. 
As a courtesy, I have asked the FBI whether it would be possible to provide us with a similar excel index reflecting the 
physical evidence seized by the FBI's New York Office, though it may take some time to compile such an index.

Counsel, 
In advance of our call tomorrow, I wanted to send a copy of the attached index of physical items in FBI custody from the 
FBI-Miami office, which we previously produced to you as part of our August 21, 2020 discovery production. Also 
included in that August 21, 2020 production were scans of numerous items listed on the index. Those scans can be found 
within Bates range SDNY_GM_00172218-SDNY_GM_00173007. It may be useful to reference some of those items during 
our conversation tomorrow, so I wanted to make sure you were aware of them.
