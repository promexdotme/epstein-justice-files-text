Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 468 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/24/2019 Page 1 of 5 
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA 
CASE NO. 08-80736-CIV-MARRA 
JANE DOE 1 AND JANE DOE 2, 
Petitioners, 
vs 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, 
Respondent. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
Limited Intervenor. 
LIMITED INTERVENOR JEFFREY EPSTEIN'S MOTION FOR 
LEAVE TO FILE A REPLY ON OR BEFORE AUGUST 22, 2019 
Limited Intervenor JEFFREY EPSTEIN, through undersigned counsel, respectfully 
moves the Court for an Order granting him leave to file a reply to Petitioners' Reply to 
Intervenor Epstein's Brief in Opposition to Proposed Remedies (DE 466), on or before 
August 22, 2019. 
1. On May 13, 2019, this Court entered an Order (DE 454) setting a briefing 
schedule for the Petitioners to file their initial submission on proposed remedies, 
the government and Mr. Epstein to file a response, and for Petitioners to file a 
reply. 
2. Petitioners filed their initial submission on May 23, 2019 (DE 458), the 
government filed its response on June 24, 2019 (DE 462), Mr. Epstein filed his 
EFTA00021512

Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 468 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/24/2019 Page 2 of 5 
response on July 8, 2019 (DE 463), and Petitioners filed their replies to the 
government and Mr. Epstein's submissions on July 9 & 23, 2019, respectively 
(DE 464; DE 466). 
3. Petitioners' reply to Mr. Epstein's Brief (DE 466) is 65 pages long. In that reply, 
among other things, Petitioners' counsel: 
a) 
raise an issue, for the first time, about the binding nature of the NPA 
on other districts, which is not relevant to the issues before the Court and has 
never been briefed before this Court (DE 466:3-5); 
b) 
rely on sealed documents that Mr. Epstein has never seen (DE 466:19-
23, 48), to argue, for the first time at the remedy phase, that a purported 
conflict of interest that allegedly plagued one of Mr. Epstein's lawyers 
somehow requires partial rescission of the NPA, despite that it is a criminal 
defendant's sixth amendment right — not an alleged victim's — to insist that 
the defendant be represented by conflict-free counsel; 
c) 
rely heavily on the case of San Pedro v. United States, 79 f.3d 1065, 
1068 (11" Cir. 1999) (DE 466:24-25, 38), an easily distinguished case not 
cited by Petitioners in their initial submission (DE 458) that Mr. Epstein has 
never had an opportunity to address; 
d) 
adopt positions that are different from their initial submission, 
compare DE 466:27 (now defining "partial rescission" as "rescission of the 
immunity provisions for only those victims who seek rescission") with DE 
EFTA00021513
--- PAGE 3 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 468 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/24/2019 Page 3 of 5 
458:4, 5, 13 (not limiting the request for partial rescission to only 
Petitioners); 
e) 
accuse Mr. Epstein's counsel of "misleading briefing" in the section 
on the general releases in the Settlement Agreements (DE 466:42), for using 
ellipses in place of the words "compensatory or punitive damages," even 
though the general releases preclude all actions or claims in equity against 
Mr. Epstein which, by definition, involve injunctive relief and do not involve 
compensatory or punitive damages; 
contend that the Court's Order (DE 454:2) permitting the filing of 
affidavits and declarations at the remedy phase undermines Mr. Epstein's 
procedural due process argument (DE 466:7-10), a contention to which Mr. 
Epstein has never had an opportunity to respond; 
g) 
mischaracterize Mr. Epstein's discussion of the Walke• case (DE 
464:55-56), inasmuch as it was not the Seventh Circuit's ruling in Walker 
that Mr. Epstein claimed was "entirely confused," but rather the Petitioners' 
discussion of it in their initial submission. (DE 463:25); and 
h) 
advocate for a remarkably primitive view of the constitutional role of 
defense lawyers, labeling as "bad faith" defense counsel's denial of their 
presumptively innocent client's guilt (DE 466:21), and claiming that they are 
"instigators" of government violations as a result of demands they made, 
without coercion or bribery, during the normal back and forth of plea 
negotiations.

--- PAGE 4 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 468 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/24/2019 Page 4 of 5 
4. Given the new arguments, changed position, and the stakes involved, Mr. 
Epstein respectfully requests leave to file a reply to Petitioners' recent 
submission on or before August 22, 2019. 
5. Mr. Epstein is currently detained at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in 
Manhattan. As a result, it is more time-consuming to review drafts of a 
submission with him before the submission is filed. 
6. Counsel for Mr. Epstein communicated with AUSA Jill E. Steinberg, counsel 
for the government, who advises that the government does not object. Counsel 
for Mr. Epstein also communicated with Paul Cassell, counsel for the 
Petitioners, who advises that the Petitioners will likely object.

Regarding the court conference, we are unfortunately not able to reserve seats for anyone—the court manages court 
security and the crowd, so we don't have control over that. The other victim attorneys have been attending the 
conferences on their own, and although I don't know, I would guess that means that they have been arriving early.

Dear 
The Bloom Firm represents two women who allege they were fraudulently recruited and enticed 
by Epstein and/or his agents to perform a personal massage on him at his private residence, 
located at 9 East 71st St., New York, NY 10021, in exchange for hundreds of dollars that 
resulted in Epstein forcefully sexually assaulting our clients in what we believe is in violation of 
Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1591(a) and (b). Our clients believe they were assaulted 
EFTA00021530
--- PAGE 2 ---
by Epstein in or around June 2004. Our clients did not consent or agree to any sexual touching 
or activity with Mr. Epstein. Our clients are also concerned, after learning about the pictures 
recovered from Mr. Epstein's home, that sexually explicit pictures were unknowingly taken of 
them during the incidents. 
Our clients' names are 
r'lease 
be advised, our clients wish to remain anonymous at this juncture and do not consent to their 
names being released to the public. Please advise immediately if it appears as if our clients' 
identities will be released to the public and/or Mr. Epstein's legal team. If revealing the identities 
is necessary for the case to move forward, please advise prior to doing so, so that our clients 
can make an informed decision. 
We understand your office may be interested in interviewing our clients for additional details. We

As you know, the protective order distinguishes between all discovery and that marked "sensitive," and it is the sensitive 
discovery that cannot be publicly filed. El 
statements to law enforcement do not fall into the sensitive 
category, so they should be publicly filed. We'd ask that, consistent with the protective order, any sensitive discovery and 
references to cooperators be redacted in your public filings. Along the same lines, we noticed that you publicly filed four 
documents that were marked sensitive (Exhibits A through D to your cell site motion) in violation of the protective order. 
We will be asking the Court to remove them from the docket and you will need to refile.

It is a little difficult to know what needs to be sealed/redacted in the abstract. Out of an abundance of caution, can you 
file the documents with any reference to evidence/discovery and cooperators redacted? We can then review the 
unredacted version and discuss what, if anything, can be unredacted for the public version.

Our motions will be ready to go out in a few hours., One is straight forward legal argument about the cell tower data, 
which we don't have a problem filing. The other motion deals with the statements to the police and by necessity we

We will take care of that error and apologize for it. 
I know that the statements are not marked as sensitive by the Government but for obvious reasons we don't want to file

As you know, the protective order distinguishes between all discovery and that marked "sensitive;' and it is the sensitive 
discovery that cannot be publicly filed. 
statements to law enforcement do not fall into the sensitive

references to cooperators be redacted in your public filings. Along the same lines, we noticed that you publicly filed four

discuss the statements in detail. We also discuss some of the discovery and the cooperating witnesses. What is the 
Government position about filing that motion under seal? 
Also, 
affidavit hasn't been signed because the only regular access to a notary are members of his legal team and we 
don't want to witness his signature. We will have him sign it through whatever the process is at MCC or in open court at 
our next appearance.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA 
Case No. 08-80736-Civ-Marra/Johnson 
JANE DOE #1 and JANE DOE #2 
v. 
UNITED STATES 
JANE DOE #3 AND JANE DOE #4's CORRECTED MOTION PURSUANT TO RULE 21 
FOR JOINDER IN ACTION 
COME NOW Jane Doc #3 and Jane Doc #4 (also referred to as "the new victims"), by and 
through undersigned counsel, to file this motion pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 21 
to join this action, on the condition that they not re-litigate any issues already litigated by Jane 
Doc #1 and Jane Doe #2 (also referred to as "the current victims"). The new victims have 
suffered the same violations of their rights under the Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA) as the 
current victims. Accordingly, they desire to join in this action to vindicate their rights as well. 
Because the new victims will not re-litigate any issues previously litigated by the current victims 
(and because they are represented by the same legal counsel as the current victims), the 
Government will not be prejudiced if the Court grants the motion. The Court may "at any time" 
add new parties to the action, Fed. R. Civ. P. 21. Accordingly, the Court should grant the 
motion.' 
FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
As minor victims of sexual offenses, Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4 desire to proceed by 
way of pseudonym for the same reasons that Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 proceeded in this 
fashion. Counsel for the new victims have made their true identities known to the Government.

Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 280 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/02/2015 Page 2 of 14 
As the Court is aware, more than six years ago, Jane Doe #1 filed the present action 
against the Government, alleging a violation of her rights under the CVRA, 18 U.S.C. § 3771. 
DE I. She alleged that Jeffrey Epstein had sexually abused her and that the United States had 
entered into a secret non-prosecution agreement (NPA) regarding those crimes in violation of her 
rights. At the first court hearing on the case, the Court allowed Jane Doe #2 to also join the 
action. Both Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doc #2 specifically argued that the government had failed to 
protect their CVRA rights (inter alia) to confer, to reasonable notice, and to be treated with 
fairness. In response, the Government argued that the CVRA rights did not apply to Jane Doe #1 
and Jane Doe #2 because no federal charges had ever been filed against Jeffrey Epstein. 
The Court has firmly rejected the United States' position. In a detailed ruling, the Court 
concluded that the CVRA extended rights to Jane Doc #1 and Jane Doc #2 even though federal 
charges were never filed. 
DE 189. 
The Court explained that because the NPA barred 
prosecution of crimes committed against them by Epstein, they had "standing" to assert 
violations of the CVRA rights. Id. The Court deferred ruling on whether the two victims would 
be entitled to relief, pending development of a fuller evidentiary record. id. 
Two other victims, who arc in many respects similarly situated to the current victims, 
now wish to join this action. The new victims joining at this stage will not cause any delay and 
their joinder in this case is the most expeditious manner in which to pursue their rights. Because 
the background regarding their abuse is relevant to the Court's assessment of whether to allow 
them to join, their circumstances are recounted here briefly.

Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 280 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/02/2015 Page 3 of 14 
As with Jane Doe 41 and Jane Doe #2, Jane Doc #3 was repeatedly sexually abused by 
Epstein. The Government then concealed from Jane Doe #3 the existence of its NPA from Jane 
Doc #3, in violation of her rights under the CVRA. If allowed to join this action, Jane Doc #3 
would prove the following: 
In 1999, Jane Doc #3 was approached by Ghislaine Maxwell, one of the main women 
whom Epstein used to procure under-aged girls for sexual activities and a primary co-conspirator 
in his sexual abuse and sex trafficking scheme. In fact, it became known to the government that 
Maxwell herself regularly participated in Epstein's sexual exploitation of minors, including Jane 
Doe #3. Maxwell persuaded Jane Doc #3 (who was then fifteen years old) to come to Epstein's 
mansion in a fashion very similar to the manner in which Epstein and his other co-conspirators 
coerced dozens of other children (including Jane Doe 41 and Jane Doe #2). When Jane Doc #3 
began giving Epstein a "massage," Epstein and Maxwell turned it into a sexual encounter, as 
they had done with many other victims. Epstein then became enamored with Jane Doe #3, and 
with the assistance of Maxwell convened her into what is commonly referred to as a "sex slave." 
Epstein kept Jane Doe #3 as his sex slave from about 1999 through 2002, when she managed to 
escape to a foreign country and hide out from Epstein and his co-conspirators for years. From 
1999 through 2002, Epstein frequently sexually abused Jane Doe #3, not only in West Palm 
Beach, but also in New York, New Mexico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, in international airspace on 
his Epstein's private planes, and elsewhere. 
Epstein also sexually trafficked the then-minor Jane Doe, making her available for sex to 
politically-connected and financially-powerful people. Epstein's purposes in "lending" Jane Doe 
(along with other young girls) to such powerful people were to ingratiate himself with them for

business, personal, political, and financial gain, as well as to obtain potential blackmail 
information. 
One such powerful individual that Epstein forced then-minor Jane Doe 43 to have sexual 
relations with was former Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz, a close friend of F.pstein's 
and well-known criminal defense attorney. Epstein required Jane Doe #3 to have sexual 
relations with Dershowitz on numerous occasions while she was a minor, not only in Florida but 
also on private planes, in New York, New Mexico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. In addition to 
being a participant in the abuse of Jane Doe #3 and other minors, Deshowitz was an eye-witness 
to the sexual abuse of many other minors by Epstein and several of Epstein's co-conspirators. 
Dershowitz would later play a significant role in negotiating the NPA on Epstein's behalf. 
Indeed, Dershowitz helped negotiate an agreement that provided immunity from federal 
prosecution in the Southern District of Florida not only to Epstein, but also to "any potential co-
conspirators of Epstein." NPA at 5. Thus, Dershowitz helped negotiate an agreement with a 
provision that provided protection for himself against criminal prosecution in Florida for 
sexually abusing Jane Doe #3. Because this broad immunity would have been controversial if 
disclosed, Dershowitz (along with other members of Epstein's defense team) and the 
Government tried to keep the immunity provision secret from all of Epstein's victims and the 
general public, even though such secrecy violated the Crime Victims' Rights Act. 
Ghislaine Maxwell was another person in Epstein's inner circle and a co-conspirator in 
Epstein's sexual abuse. She was someone who consequently also appreciated the immunity 
granted by the NPA for the crimes she committed in Florida. In addition to participating in the 
sexual abuse of Jane Doe #3 and others, Maxwell also took numerous sexually explicit pictures

of underage girls involved in sexual activities, including Jane Doe #3. 
She shared these 
photographs (which constituted child pornography under applicable federal laws) with Epstein. 
The Government is apparently aware of, and in certain instances possesses some of these 
photographs. 
Perhaps even more important to her role in Epstein's sexual abuse ring, Maxwell had 
direct connections to other powerful individuals with whom she could connect Epstein. For 
instance, one such powerful individual Epstein forced Jane Doe 03 to have sexual relations with 
was a member of the British Royal Family, Prince Andrew (a/k/a Duke of York). Jane Doe #3 
was forced to have sexual relations with this Prince when she was a minor in three separate 
geographical locations: in London (at Ghislaine Maxwell's apartment), in New York, and on 
Epstein's private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands (in an orgy with numerous other under-aged 
girls). Epstein instructed Jane Doc #3 that she was to give the Prince whatever he demanded and 
required Jane Doe #3 to report back to him on the details of the sexual abuse. Maxwell 
facilitated Prince Andrew's acts of sexual abuse by acting as a "madame" for Epstein, thereby 
assisting in internationally trafficking Jane Doc #3 (and numerous other young girls) for sexual 
purposes. 
Another person in Epstein's inner circle of friends (who becomes apparent with almost 
no investigative effort) is Jean Luc Brunel. Epstein sexually trafficked Jane Doe #3 to Jean Luc 
Brunel many times. Brunel was another of Epstein's closest friends and a regular traveling 
companion, who had many contacts with young girls throughout the world. Brunel has been a 
model scout for various modeling agencies for many years and apparently was able to get U.S. 
passports for young girls to "work" as models. He would bring young girls (ranging to ages as

young as twelve) to the United States for sexual purposes and farm them out to his friends, 
especially Epstein. Brunel would offer the girls "modeling" jobs. Many of the girls came from 
poor countries or impoverished backgrounds, and he lured them in with a promise of making 
good money. Epstein forced Jane Doe #3 to observe him, Brunel and Maxwell engage in illegal 
sexual acts with dozens of underage girls. Epstein also forced Jane Doe #3 to have sex with 
Brunel on numerous occasions, at places including Epstein's mansion in West Palm Beach, Little 
St. James Island in the U.S. Virgin Islands (many including orgies that were comprised of other 
underage girls), New York City, New Mexico, Paris, the south of France, and California. 
Epstein also trafficked Jane Doe #3 for sexual purposes to many other powerful men, 
including numerous prominent American politicians, powerful business executives, foreign 
presidents, a well-known Prime Minister, and other world leaders. Epstein required Jane Doe #3 
to describe the events that she had with these men so that he could potentially blackmail them. 
The Government was well aware of Jane Doc #3 when it was negotiating the NPA, as it 
listed her as a victim in the attachment to the NPA. Moreover, even a rudimentary investigation 
of Jane Doe #3's relationship to Epstein would have revealed the fact that she had been 
trafficked throughout the United States and internationally for sexual purposes. Nonetheless, the 
Government secretly negotiated a non-prosecution agreement with Epstein precluding any 
Federal prosecution in the Southern District of Florida of Epstein and his co-conspirators. As 
with Jane Doe #1, and Jane Doe #2, the Government concealed the non-prosecution agreement 
from Jane Doe #3 — all in violation of her rights under the CVRA — to avoid Jane Doe #3 from 
raising powerful objections to the NPA that would have shed tremendous public light on Epstein

and other powerful individuals and that would likely have been prevented it from being 
concluded in the secretive manner in which it was. 
Jane Doe #4's Circumstances 
if permitted to join this action, Jane Doe #4 would allege, and could prove at trial, that 
she has CVRA claims similar to those advanced by Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2, based on the 
following: 
As with the other Jane Does, Jane Doe #4 was repeatedly sexually abused by Epstein. In 
or around the summer of 2002, Jane Doe #4, an economically poor and vulnerable sixteen-year-
old child, was told by another one of Epstein's underage minor sex abuse victims, that she could 
make $300 cash by giving an old man a massage on Palm Beach. An acquaintance of Jane Doe 
#4 (also a minor sexual abuse victim of Epstein) telephoned Epstein and scheduled Jane Doc #4 
to go to Epstein's house to give him a massage. During that call, Epstein himself got on the 
phone (a means of interstate communication) with Jane Doe #4, asking her personally to come to 
his mansion in Palm Beach. 
Jane Doc #4 then went to Epstein's mansion and was escorted upstairs to Epstcin's large 
bathroom by one of Epstein's assistants. Shortly thereafter Jeffrey Epstein emerged and lay face 
down on the table and told Jane Doc #4 to start massaging him. Epstein asked Jane Doc #3 her 
age and she told him she had recently turned sixteen. Epstein subsequently committed illegal 
sexual acts against Jane Doc #4 on many occasions. 
Epstein used a means of interstate communication (i.e., a cell phone) to arrange for these 
sexual encounters. Epstein also frequently travelled in interstate commerce (i.e., on his personal 
jet) for purposes of illegally sexually abusing Jane Doc #4.

--- PAGE 9 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 280 Entered on FLSD Docket 03./02/2015 Page 8 of 14 
The acts Epstein committed against Jane Doe #4, constituted numerous federal sex 
offenses, some of which do not carry a statute of limitations and thus are not time-barred. See 18 
U.S.C. § 3283. And these offenses were the kinds of offenses that the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation (FBI) and U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida were pursuing 
in 2007. So far as Jane Doc #4 is aware, the U.S. Attorney's Office made no serious effort to 
locate her. Instead, after identifying approximately forty separate underage sexually abused 
victims, and apparently preparing a 53-page federal indictment and with full awareness of the 
existence of many victims like Jane Doe #4 — unidentified and not interviewed — it entered into a 
non-prosecution agreement barring prosecution of Epstein's federal crimes against these victims. 
This is contrary to the Government's normal approach in prosecuting federal sex offenses. It 
also violated Jane Doe #4's rights under the CVRA, including the fact that she had a 
"reasonable" right to confer with the U.S. Attorney's Office before they entered into an 
agreement with a sex offender barring prosecution of him for the crimes he committed against 
her. 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(5). 
MOTION FOR JOINDER 
Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4 now both move to join this action filed by Jane Doe #1 and 
Jane Doc #2, pursuant to Rule 21 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Rule 21 provides that 
"[ojn motion or on its own, the court may at any time, on just terms, add . .. a party." Rule 21 
"grants the court broad discretion to permit a change in the parties at any stage of a litigation." 
Ford v. Air Line Pilots Ass 'n 
268 F. Supp. 2d 271, 295 (E.D.N.Y. 2003) (internal quotation 
omitted). The new victims should be allowed to join the current victims in this action under Rule 
21.

Me new victims will establish at trial that the Government violated their CVRA rights in 
the same way as it violated the rights of the other victims. The new victims' participation in this 
case is important because it appears that the Government intends to raise a factual defense that 
somehow it did keep Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 properly informed of what was happening in 
the criminal prosecution. Of course, if four victims all testify consistently that they were not 
properly informed by the Government (as we believe they will), that provides a stronger case for 
a CVRA violation. 
In addition, Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4's participation is relevant to a defense the 
Court has allowed the Government to raise. The Court has previously ruled that the victims' 
request for rescission of the NPA "implicates a fact-sensitive equitable defense which must be 
considered in the historical factual context of the entire interface between Epstein, the relevant 
prosecutorial authorities and the federal offense victims - including an assessment of the 
allegation of a deliberate conspiracy between Epstein and federal prosecutors to keep the victims 
in the dark on the pendency of negotiations between Epstein and federal authorities until well 
after the fact and presentation of the non-prosecution agreement to them as a fait accompli." DE 
189 at 12 n.6 (emphasis added). Jane Doe #3's and Jane Doc #4's participation in this case will 
help to show what the "entire interface" was between the Government and the victims and thus 
to respond to the Government's estoppel arguments as well as other defenses that it appears to be 
preparing to raise. See, e.g., DE 62 (52-page response from the Government to the victim's 
summary judgment motion, raising numerous factually-based and other arguments against the 
victim's position).

Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 280 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/02/2015 Page 10 of 14 
Jane Doe #3's and Jane Doe #4's participation is also directly relevant to the discovery 
disputes currently pending in this case. The Government has raised various relevancy objections 
to the documents that Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doc #2 are attempting to obtain. The current 
victims have responded by explaining how these documents are relevant, including explaining 
how these documents might bear on the way in which Epstein used his powerful political and 
social connections to secure a favorable plea deal. as well as provide proof of the Government's 
motive to deliberately fail to investigate certain aspects of the victims' claims in an effort to 
maintain the secrecy of the facts and resolve the case without the victims' knowledge. See, e.g., 
DE 266 at 6-10. Jane Doc #3 and Jane Doe #4's participation will help prove the relevancy of 
these requests, as well as the need for those requests. 
One clear example is Request for Production No. 8. which seeks documents regarding 
Epstein's lobbying efforts to persuade the Government to give him a more favorable plea 
arrangement and/or non-prosecution agreement, including efforts on his behalf by Prince 
Andrew and former Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz. Jane Doc #1 and Jane Doe #2 
have alleged these materials are needed to prove their allegations that, after Epstein signed the 
non-prosecution agreement, his performance was delayed while he used his significant social and 
political connections to lobby the Justice Department to obtain a more favorable plea deal. See, 
e.g., DE 225 at 7-8 (discussing DE 48 at 16-18). Jane Doe #3 has directly person knowledge of 
Epstein's connection with some of these powerful people and thus how Epstein might have used 
them to secure favorable treatment. 
Adding two new victims to this case will not delay any of the proceedings. They will 
simply join in motions that the current victims were going to file in any event. For example, the

--- PAGE 12 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 280 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/02/2015 Page 11 of 14 
new victims will simply join in a single summary judgment motion that the current victims 
anticipate filing after discovery has been completed. 
Nor will adding the new victims prejudice the United States. As the court is aware, this 
Court is still in its initial discovery stage. The Court is currently considering whether to reject 
the Government's assertion of privilege over documents regarding the case. See DE 265 
(victims' reassertion of objections to the Government privilege claims). The new victims do not 
sock any additional discovery beyond that previously sought by the current victims.2
Accordingly, the United States will not be prejudiced or burdened by adding them to this case. 
The CVRA does not contain any statute of limitations for filing an action to enforce 
rights under the statute. Accordingly, were the Court to deny this motion, the result might be 
that the new victims would then be forced to file a separate suit raising their claims, which would 
then possibly proceed on a separate litigation track. Rather than require duplicative litigation, 
the Court should simply grant their motion to join. 
Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doc #2 support the joinder motion. Counsel for the victims have 
discussed this motion with the Government at length in an effort to avoid any need to file a 
substantive pleading on the issue. Counsel for the victims asked the Government during the 
summer for its position on joinder. 
The Government, however, took the matter under 
advisement for months. 
Ultimately, after several inquiries from victims counsel, the 
Government indicated without explanation that it opposes this motion. Counsel for the victims 
has requested a meeting with the Government on this issue, which will hopefully occur in 
Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4 have asked the Government to provide them with the 
record of their statements that they provided to the FBI. These FBI 302's should be only a few 
pages long.

January. In the meantime, however, counsel for the victims believe that it is no longer 
appropriate to delay filing this motion and accordingly file it at this time. 
Because the 
Government is apparently opposing this motion, Jane Doc #3 and Jane Doc #4 have described 
the circumstances surrounding their claims so that the Court has appropriate information to rule 
on the motion.

Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4 should be allowed to join this action, pursuant to Rule 21 
of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Their joinder should be conditioned on the requirement 
that they not re-litigate any issues previously litigated by Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2.

Hey 
Did you add the redaction on page 117? (It may have been there from an old version this morning.) Either way, since it 
now quotes from the public Second Circuit docket, I think we don't need to redact that bit. 
Will, I caught a nit in the first sentence of V.C.I — it says "Ex. 1014:9" instead of "Ex. 10 at 14:9." 
Otherwise, I am pencils down! (Maurene, if you still think it's useful to create a public, redacted version of the July depo, I 
can do that quickly while you finalize.)

Following up on my very brief conversation with Chris earlier this afternoon, and the voicemail you left earlier, thanks for 
getting in touch regarding your representation of Ms. Maxwell. I understand you'll be in our neighborhood tomorrow 
afternoon; we can make ourselves available to meet, but will that have been enough time for you to speak with your 
client? Let us know what you think would be best to proceed, and we'll figure out next steps. 
thanks,

Mike, 
Regarding the conference tomorrow, we don't currently expect to make any arguments based on new facts, but we will 
respond to any questions from the Court as appropriate. 
We will make best efforts to bring the passport, if we're able to do so and if chain custody can be maintained. In any 
event, you are free to schedule a time with us to review the passport and any other physical evidence that has been 
collected.

More photos of the Austrian passport...The last 2 photos are taken of Epstein's expired US passport also found 
in the safe from around the same time period of the Austrian passport with a photo of Epstein for comparison.

So there does appear to be a Marius Fortelni, originally from Austria, currently living in Southampton, NY — see: 
http://forteproperties.us/about us.htm 
http://www.mariusfortelni.com/ 
Notably—given the "residence" entry on the passport—according to Mr. Fortelni's website he resided for a time in Saudi 
Arabia. If it's possible, could we determine Marius Fortelni's birthday, and see if it matches up with the 
date 
on the passport? And then try to contact him and ask if he has any reason to know why a passport from his native 
country with his name on it would have Jeffrey Epstein's photograph on it and be in a safe in Epstein's mansion?? Given 
the time pressure I think it's totally fine to call him if you want, but completely defer to y'all. 
Thank you!!

Thanks for reaching out. I am currently out of the country, but am flying back today. I've copied in Tom Moyer 
who has been primarily assisting us with this matter while Parvin has been out of the country. I believe we are 
preparing a subsequent production for SDNY to be produced shortly, but Tom will confirm and let you know 
about timing. 
I understand that Epstein had an initial client advisor who is no longer with the bank, but there was coverage 
over the relationship after he left. Tom and Parvin should be able to give you info on this point and how we can 
coordinate an interview(s) as you describe, ASAP. 
I will also be back later today/this evening if you would like to speak directly.

for us to speak mid-next week. And as I also mentioned, we don't currently have any reason to believe that'

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
x 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
Defendant. 
PROTECTIVE ORDER 
Cr. 490 (RMB) 
 x 
RICHARD M. BERMAN, United States District Judge: 
WHEREAS the Government intends to produce to JEFFREY 
EPSTEIN, the defendant, certain documents and materials that 
(i) affect the privacy and confidentiality of individuals, 
(ii) would impede, if prematurely disclosed, the Government's 
ongoing investigation of uncharged individuals; (iii) would risk 
prejudicial pretrial publicity if publicly disseminated, and 
(iv) is not authorized to be disclosed to the public or 
disclosed beyond that which is necessary for the defense of this 
action, and other materials pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal 
Procedure 16 ("Rule 16") and pursuant to any other disclosure 
obligations (collectively, the "Discovery"), which contain 
sensitive, confidential, or personal identifying information; 
WHEREAS, the Government seeks to protect sensitive, 
confidential, or personal identifying information contained in 
the materials it produces consistent with Rule 16 or other 
disclosure obligations; 
EFTA00021651
--- PAGE 2 ---
WHEREAS the defendant, through his counsel, consents 
to the entry of this Order; 
IT HEREBY IS ORDERED: 
I. 
The Discovery disclosed to the defendant 
("Defendant") and/or to the defendant's attorneys ("Defense 
Counsel") during the course of proceedings in this action: 
a) 
Shall be used by the defendant or his 
counsel solely for purposes of the defense of this action; 
b) 
Shall not be copied or otherwise recorded or 
transmitted by the defendant; 
c) 
Shall not be disclosed or distributed in any 
form by the defendant or his counsel except as set forth in 
paragraph 2(d) below;

only to the following persons ("Designated Persons"): 
i. 
investigative, secretarial, clerical, 
or paralegal personnel employed full-time or part-time by the 
defendant's counsel ("Defense Staff"); 
ii. 
any expert, advisor, or any other 
individual retained or employed by the Defendant and Defense 
Counsel for the purpose of assisting in the defense of this case 
("Defense Experts/Advisors"); 
iii. 
such other persons as hereafter may be 
authorized by Order of the Court ("Other Authorized Persons"); 
EFTA00021652
--- PAGE 3 ---
e) 
May be shown to, but not disseminated to or 
provided copies of to, prospective witnesses and their counsel 
(collectively, "Potential Witnesses"), to the extent deemed 
necessary by defense counsel, for trial preparation. 
2. 
To the extent the Discovery is disclosed to 
Defense Staff, Defense Experts/Advisors, Other Authorized 
Persons, or Potential Witnesses, Defense Counsel shall instruct 
such individual(s) of the terms of this Order and that such 
individual(s) are bound by this Order. To the extent that 
Discovery is disseminated to Defense Staff, Defense 
Experts/Advisors, or Other Authorized Persons, Defense Counsel 
shall encrypt and/or password protect the Discovery. 
3. 
The Defendant, Defense Counsel, Defense Staff, 
Defense Experts/Advisors, Potential Witnesses, and Other 
Authorized Persons are prohibited from posting or causing to be 
posted any of the Discovery or information contained in the 
Discovery on the Internet, including any social media website 
4. 
The Defendant, Defense Counsel, Defense Staff, 
Defense Experts/Advisors, Potential Witnesses, and Other 
Authorized Persons are precluded from publicly disclosing or 
disseminating the identity of any victims or witnesses 
referenced in the Discovery. 
5. 
The Defendant, Defense Counsel, Defense Staff, 
Defense Experts/Advisors, Potential Witnesses, and Other 
EFTA00021653
--- PAGE 4 ---
Authorized Persons are prohibited from filing publicly as an 
attachment to a filing or excerpted within a filing any of the 
Discovery or information contained in the Discovery, unless 
authorized by the Government in writing or by Order of the 
Court. Any filings that incorporate the Discovery by 
attachment, contain any excerpts of Discovery, or incorporate 
Discovery by reference must be filed under seal. Nothing in 
this Order precludes Defense Counsel from using the Discovery in 
judicial proceedings in this case. 
6. 
Copies of Discovery or other materials produced 
by the Government in this action bearing "confidential" stamps 
or otherwise designated as "confidential" and/or electronic 
Discovery materials designated as "confidential" by the 
Government, including such materials marked as "confidential" 
either on the documents or materials themselves, or designated 
as "confidential" in a cover letter, index, folder title, or 
other identifying designation, are deemed "Confidential 
Information." 
7. 
Confidential Information may contain personal 
identification information of specific individuals who are not 
parties to this action, and other confidential information; as 
well as information that identifies, or could lead to the 
identification of, witnesses who may be subject to intimidation

EFTA00021654
--- PAGE 5 ---
as the lives, persons, and property of loved ones, will be 
subject to risk of harm absent the protective considerations set 
forth herein. The Government's designation of material as 
Confidential Information will be controlling absent contrary 
order of the Court. 
8. 
Confidential Information disclosed to the 
defendant, or Defense Counsel, respectively, during the course 
of proceedings in this action: 
a) 
Shall be used by the defendant or his

defense counsel and/or Defense Staff instructs such 
individual(s) of the terms of this Order and that such 
individual(s) are bound by this Order. 
EFTA00021655
--- PAGE 6 ---
9. 
Copies of Discovery or other materials produced 
by the Government in this action bearing "highly confidential" 
stamps or otherwise designated as "highly confidential" and/or 
electronic Discovery materials designated as "highly 
confidential" by the Government, including such materials marked 
as "highly confidential" either on the documents or materials 
themselves, or designated as "highly confidential" in a cover 
letter, index, folder title, or other identifying designation, 
are deemed "Highly Confidential Information." 
10. Highly Confidential Information contains images 
of nude or partially-nude individuals. The Government's 
designation of material as Highly Confidential Information will 
be controlling absent contrary order of the Court. Highly 
Confidential Information disclosed to Defense Counsel during the 
course of proceedings in this action: 
a) 
Shall not be disseminated, transmitted, or 
otherwise copied and provided to Defense Counsel or the 
Defendant; 
b) 
Shall be reviewed by the Defendant solely in 
the presence of Defense Counsel; 
c) 
Shall not be possessed outside the presence 
of Defense Counsel, or maintained, by the Defendant; 
EFTA00021656
--- PAGE 7 ---
d) 
Shall be made available for inspection by 
Defense Counsel and the Defendant, under the protection of law 
enforcement officers or employees; and 
e) 
Shall not be copied or otherwise duplicated 
by Defense Counsel or the Defendant during such inspections. 
11. The Defendant and Defense Counsel shall provide a 
copy of this Order to Designated Persons to whom they disclose 
Confidential Information or Highly Confidential Information. 
Prior to disclosure of such information to Designated Persons, 
any such Designated Person shall agree to be subject to the 
terms of this Order by signing a copy hereof and stating that 
they "Agree to be bound by the terms herein," and providing such 
copy to the defendant's counsel. However, the defendant and his 
or her respective counsel need not obtain signatures from any 
member of the defense team (i.e., attorneys, experts, 
consultants, paralegals, investigators, support personnel, and 
secretarial staff involved in the representation of the 
defendants in this case), all of whom are nonetheless bound by 
this Protective Order. 
12. Except for Discovery that has been made part of 
the record of this case, Defense Counsel shall return to the 
Government or securely destroy or delete all Discovery, 
including but not limited to Confidential Information, within 30 
days of the expiration of the period for direct appeal from any 
EFTA00021657
--- PAGE 8 ---
verdict in the above-captioned case; the period of direct appeal 
from any order dismissing any of the charges in the above-
captioned case; or the granting of any motion made on behalf of 
the Government dismissing any charges in the above-captioned 
case, whichever date is later. 
EFTA00021658
--- PAGE 9 ---
13. The foregoing provisions shall remain in effect 
unless and until either (a) the Government and Defense Counsel 
mutually agree otherwise, or (b) this Order is modified by 
further order of the Court.

Hi =, 
I hope all's well. We've had a chance to review the records, and we'd like to learn more about one aircraft in particular. 
(I've pasted your notes on it below.) 
From our conversation, it sounds like the best next step is to contact the title companies involved. Do you have contacts 
at Insured Aircraft Title Service Inc. and Aero Records and Title Co.? If not, I'll just give them a call. 
Thanks,

On December 30, 2008, Sikosrksy Aircraft helicopter, S-76C-2, serial number 760750, tail number N750A was sold to; 
Air Ghislaine Inc 
Wilmington, Delaware 19803 
The registrant was Larry VISOSKI, he signed as Director of Aviation 
On February 11, 2010, Air Ghislaine Inc changed their name to Shmitka Air Inc. 
In March 2010, Air Ghislaine Inc changed the tail number from N750A to N722JE. On the 8050-64 the signature is not 
legibile but it looks 
similar to the signature of Lawrence VISOSKI. He signed as Director of Operations for Shmitka Air Inc., f/k/a Air Ghislaine 
Inc. 
On August 25, 2010, N722JE was registered to Freedom Air International Inc., 
Wilmington, 
Delaware 19803 
The registrant was Darren K. INDYKE, he signed as Vice President 
According to a bill of sale dated July 26, 2011, Freedom Air International (Darren K. INDYKE) sold N722JE to ASI Wings LLC, 
Hartford, CT 
). 
On June 13, 2019, ASI Wings LLC sold N722JE to Hyperion Air LLC, 
St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin 
Islands 
The registrant was Lawrence P. VISOSKI Jr., he signed as Manager 
Per a bill of sale dated May 13, 2021, Hyperion Air LLC (Larry VISOSKI) sold N722JE to Industrial Integrity Solutions Inc.,

2007 Gulfstream GV-SP (G550), serial number 5173 was assigned tail number N415LM in March 2017 and was registered 
to 
Chevron USA Inc., Oakland, CA. Per a bill of sale dated March 29, 2017, Chevron USA Inc sold Gulfstream N415LM to; 
Plan D LLC 
St. Thomas, U.S. Virgins Islands 
The registrant was Lawrence VISOSKI, he signed as Manager 
I believe he is Lawrence Paul VISOSKI Jr. 
he is a pilot 
I don't see EPSTEIN's name on any of the FAA paperwork. 
There is open source reporting that VISOSKI was a pilot for EPSTEIN. 
It looks like Insured Aircraft Title Service in Oklahoma handled the transaction. 
https://insuredaircraft.com/ 
Per the Plan D LLC, statement in support of registering aircraft that was submitted to the FAA, Jeffrey E. EPSTEIN was a 
member 
and VISOSKI was the manager. Further, Plan D LLC was established in 2012 in the U.S. Virgin Islands. 
Per a request to the FAA dated August 07, 2017 from VISOSKI, they requested to change the tail number from N415LM to 
N2121E. 
In January 2018 they changed the tail number to N212JE. VISOSKI provided phone number 
and e-mail: 
On August 14, 2019 I was told that N212JE was owned by Jeffrey Epstein and was in a hangar at the Cobb County airport 
(KRYY) in Kennesaw, Georgia. 
Flight plans indicated N212JE operated on July 07, 2019 from Paris, France to Teterboro, NJ then on July 11, 2019 it 
operated from 
Teterboro, NJ to Brunswick, GA (KBQK). 
Per a bill of sale dated December 22, 2020, Lawrence VISOSKI on behalf of Plan D LLC "sold" N212JE to Six G Aviation LLC 
who "sold" it the same day 
to N550GP LLC in Ontario, CA. N212JE was registered on February 24, 2021 to N550GP and 
signed as 
manager of Frontier JV LLC, its member. 
in March 2021, they changed the tail number to N550GP and it's still registered as N550GP to N550GP LLC. 
It looks like Insured Aircraft Title Service in Oklahoma handled this transaction also.

I hope all's well. We've had a chance to review the records, and we'd like to learn more about one aircraft in particular. 
(I've pasted your notes on it below.) 
From our conversation, it sounds like the best next step is to contact the title companies involved. Do you have contacts 
at Insured Aircraft Title Service Inc. and Aero Records and Title Co.? If not, I'll just give them a call. 
Thanks,

Re: 
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) 
Dear Counsel: 
We write to notify you that the Government may seek to introduce certain evidence at trial. 
In particular, the Government may offer certain exhibits at trial that demonstrate that, in addition 
to the defendant's conduct with Jeffrey Epstein, the defendant took steps to provide other men 
with access to women. We are producing these proposed exhibits today, marked with the 
following exhibit numbers: [list]. 
In addition, please be advised that the Government may call 
as a witness 
at trial. Today, we are producing Jencks Act materials relating to Ms. 
who was ern, 
by Jeffrey Epstein from approximately 2005-2006. The Government anticipates that Ms. 
will testify about, among other things, certain documentary evidence relating to the charged 
crimes. The Government further anticipates that Ms. 
will testify about her role in 
scheduling sexualized massages for Jeffrey Epstein with underage girls. 
This evidence is admissible as direct evidence of the crimes charged and, in the alternative, 
pursuant to Rule 404(b) as proof of the defendant's intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, 
and/or absence of mistake of accident with respect to the charges in the above-referenced case.

Hope you're both doing well. Following up on our last conversation, we wanted to send along a few documents in order 
to facilitate our conversation about identifying an appropriate witness from JP Morgan. Attached is a zip file containing a 
few draft exhibits. We are still working on finalizing exhibits, but we thought it made sense to start the conversation about 
this sooner rather than later. Please let us know if you have any questions or if a call would be useful.

Among the ma erials contained in this production is an excerpt of a flight log that former 
Assistant United States Attome 
received during a February 29, 2016 meeting 
with attorneys representing 
the "February 2016 meeting"). At the 
February 2016 meeting, AUSA deceived 
copies of Jeffrey Epstein's black book, excerpts 
of flight records, and certain Palm Beach Police Department reports. Epstein's black book and the 
Palm Beach Police Department reports were previously produced to you on August 21, 2020, and 
can be found at SDNY_GM_00 174731-SDNY_GM_00 174827 and SDNY_GM_00174880- 
SDNY_ GM 00174966 respectively. Today we are producing to you the version of the flight 
recordsAU§A Kramer received at the February 2016 meeting, which includes a subset of logs 
previously 
produced 
to 
you 
on 
August 
5, 
2020 
(see 
SDNY_GM_00005532-
SDNY GM 00005676) as well as two additional pages that were not previously produced to you 
in discovery, see SDNY_GM_02742935 and SDNY_GM_02742937. 
Additionally, in recognition of the Government's obligations under Brady v. Maryland, 
373 U.S. 83 (1963) and its progeny, we are disclosing the information below. This disclosure 
should not be taken to indicate that the Government believes the enclosed information constitutes 
Brady material. Rather, we make this disclosure in an abundance of caution. Specifically, the 
Government discloses the following: 
• 
The witness identified as witness "M" in a 2007 a parte declaration, which you 
attached as Exhibit B to the Defense Pretrial Motion Number 10 for Bill of 
Particulars and Pre-Trial Disclosures in this case, is 
On or about 
November 14, 2006, 
was interviewed by the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation. The notes from that interview contain the following line on page 12: 
"rumor is that JE is gay," apparently referring to a rumor regarding Jeffrey 
Epstein's sexual orientation. 
The Government recognizes that its discovery obligations are ongoing and will promptly 
produce any additional discoverable material of which it becomes aware. Please do not hesitate

Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) 
Request to view physical evidence, "highly confidential" materials and scenes 
Dear Counsel: 
I write to formally request an opportunity to (a) view, inspect, and document the physical 
evidence seized and held in connection with this case, (b) view and inspect all materials 
designated by your office as "Highly Confidential" under the terms of the Protective Order, 
and (c) visit, document and inspect any physical scene where you allege illegal conduct 
occurred, to include the Epstein properties for which you included photographs in the 
Superseding Indictment. 
Counsel for Ms. Maxwell and our investigator(s) are available for purposes of reviewing the 
physical evidence and Highly Confidential materials on March 17-18, 2021. Given the 
volume of materials seized, we anticipate that the evidence view may take more than one eight 
(8) hour session to complete and we ask that you plan accordingly. We request that Ms. 
Maxwell be present and able to participate in that evidence view. 
If you have a log of all evidence seized in connection with this case, we ask that you provide 
it to us in advance of the evidence-view so that we may bring the appropriate equipment to 
document the items as necessary. 
With regard to the scene visits, we are open to discussing dates and times for those to occur 
over the next month. Please contact me with your proposal. We will need to make 
appropriate travel arrangements.

As a heads up (re 
, I think the flight records we have only go back to December 1997 (when 
is 17). We don't 
have any flight records before that date. I'm going to call the lawyer who represents Larry Visoski (the pilot) to ask if 
records from the 90s exist anywhere, but we may be out of luck. 
The flight records do reflect a 5/3/98 flight from PBI to good old Teterboro, and 
Maxwell, and Epstein are on the 
manifest.

In connection with the Epstein victim services meetings, could you also let us know the date of the New York meeting, 
assuming it's still the plan to do a meeting in both locations? 
And on the same subject, do you know when notifications are going out about those meetings, and who's coordinating 
that? We'd like to talk to whoever is doing the notices so we can make sure it's clear that there won't be any substantive 
update about the investigation or the status of the case. We won't be attending for that reason, and we don't want any 
victims or their counsel to have the misimpression that this is anything but purely services-related info. 
We'll also circle up internally about whether we could come down that week for interviews, separately—I'll be in Nashville 
from the 15th through the lath for a separate work trip, but will check with 
on their schedules. 
thanks,

If you have some time today we can chat about these steps at more length but in short... 
1) Sure we can make a photo array but also we have a photo book which we could just add 
to instead of 
the 6 pack. 
2) 
will be on vacation the first week of November but what about the week of October 14? FBI victim 
services is hosting the victim conference for Epstein victims in Miami on October 15 which we plan on 
attending. Are you guys coming to this? That might be the best week for us to knock out a few additional 
victim interviews, as well as meet with

So the short answer is that the load files are not completed yet. One machine alone had over 800,000 emails. The 
limitation of the load files is that they can only be generated with 25,000 entries at a time. So I got out as quickly 
as I could what fit that bill. Now along has come all the stuff from the Island that had an expiration date, so that 
took priority. I can now go back and try to generate the stuff that has yet to be processed into load files, but the 
process is slow and painful. Just as an FYI, all the content is available for taint review in FTK right now.

The taint team here apparently received materials from the search of the New York house but it's way fewer 
documents than we would have expected. Can you please let us know exactly how many electronic devices (phones, 
computers, hard drives, thumb drives, and/or discs) were sent to CART for processing, and how many were in fact 
processed and sent back to us? Or if it's easier to just put us in touch with the CART people directly, that's fine too. 
My understanding was that they were processing the materials in the attached, which appears to list approximately

Date: Fri, 08 Jan 2021 02:50:53 +0000 
For the past two days, Ms. Maxwell has not been on time for the daily 12:30 VTCs. Yesterday, she arrived at 
12:59; toda she arrived at 12:47. Until yesterday, Ms. Maxwell appeared in advance of 12:30. We appreciate 
's assistance in facilitating Ms. Maxwell's appearance, but no explanation has been provided for 
these delays.. Each delay limits the time Ms. Maxwell can confer with counsel. We hope this will not be 
repeated and is not retribution for complaints made by counsel. 
We learned today that the complaint report issued to Ms. Maxwell earlier this week has now been revised. I 
renew my request for the original report and request a copy 
of the updated report. 
This morning at 6:40 am, the team leader ordered Ms. Maxwell to clean a toilet, providing a few paper towels, 
but no gloves, sending a clear message that Ms. Maxwell should clean the toilet bare handed, despite having 
cleaned the toilet the night before. Gloves were provided only upon request by Ms. Maxwell. Per the A&O 
Handbook, sanitation duties commence at 7:30 am for pretrial inmates (See A&O, p.4). We request that Ms. 
Maxwell be permitted to perform sanitation duties in the evening when returned to her isolation cell. 
Further, the team leader ordered Ms. Maxwell to clean crumbs from her bed. Lest she face another charge of 
being untidy, Ms. Maxwell attempted to comply but there were no crumbs - just stains on the blanket issued to 
her. This is another example of the petty officiousness displayed by the present team. 
The ear searches continue. Routinely, in connection with open mouth searches, guards run fingers through Ms. 
Maxwell's hair and behind her ears, at times before she gets a chance to put on her face mask.These searches -
conducted within 6 inches of Ms.Maxwell's face- continue to increase her risk of exposure to COVID. The 
number of daily searches of Ms. Maxwell, an isolated inmate under constant surveillance by multiple guards, 
seems excessive and unnecessarily violative..

Date: Thu, 07 Jan 2021 21:13:14 +0000 
Attachments: 2020.11.18_Maxwell_Discovery_Letter.pdf; 2006.12.06_FBI_Report.pdf; PROD011-
Ciaps.xlsx 
Inline-Images: image005.jpg; image006.jpg 
We write to raise a number of discovery issues. Please let us know your position on these issues at your earliest 
convenience. 
1. In our email correspondence on 11/18/2020, you agreed to create a new hard drive containing the entire discovery 
production. We provided you with a 4TB hard drive for that purpose on 11/20/2020. It is very important for Ms. 
Maxwell to have this drive as soon as possible to prepare her defense. Do you have an update on when the drive 
will be ready? 
2. We also informed you that the CD produced on November 18, 2020 did not work on the prison computer at the 
MDC (as you know, the laptop provided to Ms. Maxwell does not have a CD drive). Accordingly, we asked you to 
include the material on the CD in the new 4TB hard drive. We followed-up with you about this issue on December 
30, 2020. Given that the new hard drive is still not ready, we ask that you download the material on the CD onto 
a separate thumb drive or hard drive and provide it as quickly as possible to Ms. Maxwell at the MDC so that she 
can review the materials this weekend. Alternatively, you can provide an external CD drive to Ms. Maxwell at 
the MDC so that she can read the files on the MDC computer. We will provide whatever media device you 
require to facilitate this production. 
3. Unlike the November 9, 2020 discovery cover letter, the November 18, 2020 discovery cover letter (attached) does 
not correlate the Bates numbers to the particular "Subject Device" from which the documents were recovered. 
Instead, the cover letter indicates that the documents came from "SDNY_PROD015" or "SDNY_PROD0167 We do 
not know what those terms refer to. We request that the government produce a list that correlates the Bates 
numbers for all of the documents in SDNY_PROD015 and SDNY_PROD016 to the particular devices from which the 
documents were recovered. 
4. We request that the government provide an unredacted version of the FBI report, dated December 6, 2006, 
bearing Bates number SDNY_GM_02050812-14 (attached). We also request that the government produce a log 
identifying all of the redacted documents in the discovery and the bases for each of the redactions. 
5. There are a few documents that seem to be missing from the discovery. For example, the AT&T documents 
(SDNY_GM_00001015-3637) do not seem to include subscriber information for the various phone numbers. Also, 
the flight logs produced by David Rodgers begin at Bates number "Rodgers000028," suggesting that 
Rodgers000001-000027 were not produced to us. Please produce these documents to us or provide an 
explanation why you are not producing them to us. Please confirm whether there are other documents that were 
removed from the grand jury subpoena productions that we have not yet identified and the basis for their removal. 
6. There are a few Bates number/metadata issues with some of the documents: 
EFTA00021707
--- PAGE 2 ---
a. There is an overlap between the fourth and fifth document productions. The fourth production ends at 
SDNY_GM_00328863, the fifth production begins at SDNY_GM_00328070. We propose renumbering the 
range from the fifth production (i.e., renumber SDNY_GM_00328070-328863). 
b. The metadata load files (*.DAT) for PROD011 had a number of gaps which are detailed in the attached Excel 
file. We propose that you send us a new DAT file covering only the missing documents. 
c. The metadata load files (*.DAT) for PROD015 had a gap from SDNY_GM_00723971 to SDNY_GM_00723981. 
We propose that you send us a new DAT file covering only the missing documents. 
7. To the extent that the government has created an index of the documents produced on November 9 and 
November 18 that is more detailed than the production cover letters, we request that you provide a copy to the 
defense. 
8. We request that the government provide copies of the grand jury subpoenas for documents issued by the 
government in this case. Also, please identify the date range of documents you requested in each subpoena. 
There is one other issue we'd like to raise. An article in the Daily Beast on Monday referenced the search warrant affidavit 
for the cell-site simulator used to track Ms. Maxwell's cellphone before her arrest (https://www.thedailybeast.comThow-
the-fbi-tracked-down-ghislaine-maxwell-alleged-madam-of-jeffrey-epstein). The article stated that the affidavit appeared 
in a "newly unsealed court filing." I don't recall this affidavit being unsealed or referenced in anything that was filed on 
the court docket. Please confirm whether or not the government unsealed this affidavit or any other materials from the 
criminal discovery, and whether any discovery materials were released pursuant to FOIA requests.

Good afternoon Bobbi: 
As you noted Ms. Maxwell has continuously been produced in advance of 
12:30 PM. In addition, I would like to note that while Ms. Maxwell was 
produced after the scheduled time (twice), the additional time was 
provided to compensate for the delay. Please understand that while we 
are working to ensure all inmates are produced for their court and legal 
calls, there are institutional emergencies that require additional 
assistance, causing staff to slightly deviate from time frames. 
Should you request a copy of the incident report, Ms. Maxwell may 
provide you with it, however I cannot. I can further assure you that 
the daily searches are consistent with BOP Program Statement § 552.06, 
Searches of Housing Units, Inmates, and Inmate Work Areas. It is my 
understanding that gloves and masks were recently brought to the unit. 
Any further concerns you have indicated will be reviewed and addressed 
accordingly if need be.

Thank you very much for letting us know. It sounds like this went very well. We are in the process of drafting an MLA 
request and will get it to you ASAP. I can reach out to the lawyer for the two adult witnesses to inquire about their 
openness to speaking with the French. Asking the French to propose search terms sounds like a good next step as well.

Subject: Brunel 
Dear all: 
My meeting on Brunel went well this afternoon. Here is the quick read out: 
General Points 
• There are three investigating judges assigned to this case, which is pretty unusual...and suggests its importance for 
them. 
• They can hold Brunel for 18 months initially, but with a neutral judge's approval, can likely keep him for up to 3-4 
years while the investigation continues. 
• They did not flag any known critical points in the near future that would result in press coverage...but you never 
know what will happen (he will likely ask for release, which would catch some press if so). 
• Right out of the gate, the lead judge expressed concern about confidentiality (in part because a long article about 
their investigation appeared in a Paris newspaper yesterday). She expressed her expectation that our discussions 
and cooperation would remain confidential. 
U.S. Sharing  with France 
• They are interested in your assistance in contacting the lawyer for the two adult victims, to see if the victims would 
be willing to speak with them. 
• They are already in touch with lawyer for 
so no more is needed there. 
• They are very interested in obtaining records/images from the your database created from the searches of the 
Epstein residences/devices. They are willing to provide search terms, and can work to narrow the range (they are 
interested to know how to best formulate search terms to take advantage of the platform the records are on (i.e, 
can they do proximity searches, is facial recognition available to identify Brunel, etc.). The idea was also proposed 
of potentially doing a more narrow search now, followed by a potentially more expansive search for relevant data 
after your trial...when the SDNY/FBI bandwith might increase and confidentiality concerns might be less acute. 
• In addition to the database, they wonder if there are transcripts or reports of witness interviews that you would be 
willing to provide, that bear on Brunel. 
• In the same vein, they were interested to know if Maxwell talked to FBI post-arrest and if she said anything of 
potential interest to them (I told them 1 doubt it, but said I would ask you). 
EFTA00021721
--- PAGE 3 ---
• In terms of the confidentiality of the records you would produce, they would be put in the file, and available to the 
defense and civil parties...but they are strict limits to the circumstances in which they would have access to the 
information, and it may even be able to be placed under seal...which would apparently not preclude defense 
access, but would make it very difficult for the defense to access the info. 
• They are interested to know if you might expand your investigation to other accomplices/co-conspirators. 
• They might be interested in a direct dialogue with you, but only if it were a useful exercise (they were less 
enthusiastic than I expected about this) 
France Sharing  with U.S. 
• They responded positively regarding your interest in connecting with 
who is represented by counsel. 
They indicated a willingness to assist on the basis of an MLAT request sent through normal channels. 
• But here's the important part: they made it quite clear that they are not going to help SDNY unless we show a 
good faith effort to help them, and begin sending evidence their way. The sharing needs to be reciprocal, in 
other words. 
Path Forward 
• I'd propose that you draft the MLAT request for 
and that we get it into translation ASAP. In the 
meantime, I will invite them to send narrowed search terms, and you can contact the lawyer for the two adult 
victims...but let me know your thoughts.

This looks accurate to me, thanks very much. One point you might want to add regarding our searches is that we also 
gathered a large number of photographs, including photos that feature Brunel. Again, if they can narrow their request, we 
would be open to sharing certain images if that would be useful to them.

ME and 
Further to our call yesterday, here are the points I plan to make at my meeting tomorrow. Thanks in advance for letting me

Ways Dal Can Offer to Help Advance the French Case 
• Willing to connect French authorities with attorney for 
EFTA00021722
--- PAGE 4 ---
• DOJ has awareness of two non-French adult victims who were abused in Paris in relation to Epstein; neither allege 
specific illegal conduct involving Brunel, one of them definitely met Brunel at some point. DOJ is willing to ask their 
lawyer if the victims would be willing to speak with French authorities. 
• DOJ executed searches at two Epstein residences (in NYC and the USVI), searched devices, and has created a 
significant database of data relating to Epstein. If French authorities can provide more targeted search terms, DOJ 
would be willing to review those results to identify records that can be provided to French authorities regarding 
Brunel. 
Info to Obtain from French 
• Are French authorities targeting others besides Brunel? 
• What is the anticipated timeline of the investigation/prosecution; and are there any critical steps that would result 
in press attention in the near term (i.e., before summer 2021); 
• 
o Assistance from French in contacting/speaking with her...with awareness that matter is time sensitive given 
upcoming trial; 
o Assistance in obtaining records from French authorities (including prior interviews) pertinent to her; 
o Is she represented by counsel? 
o DOJ available to her/her counsel to discuss how we inform/protect victims and victim information (as part of 
general victim-centric approach to this case).

I apologize for the confusion. I did not know that the defense planned to file their letter in advance, and they did 
not ask us for input before filing. Judge Nathan endorsed the order within less than 24 hours without allowing 
time for any response. To be very clear, my office has never filed any response to the defense motion. The 
defense represented in their letter what I have said repeatedly to them and you, which is that my office has no 
objection to Maxwell accessing the laptop on weekends. 
I am sony that Judge Nathan ruled before you had the opportunity to inform us that you wished to respond to the 
defense letter. Given that you did not tell me that you wanted to respond when I sent you the defense letter, I did 
not realize that you intended to object. (I have attached the only response I received from you after I sent you 
the defense letter, which makes no indication of any intent to file an objection.) Had I realized, I would have 
notified the Court. 
We will, of course, file whatever letter you wish to submit with Judge Nathan, and we are always happy to 
discuss if that would be useful. We remain very grateful for all of your assistance.

We were informed after our afternoon meeting of the order. While we will be complying with the order this 
weekend, we will be filing a letter requesting the order be vacated. Judge Nathan's order states "the 
unobserved to order." I explicitly stated that MDC was objection and denying this however you failed to 
represent that to the court it seems. While I understand you do not work at the institution, and you may not 
understand the hardships this may cause, ii do expect that you would understand it is setting precedent that 
causes many serious concerns and hardships for the institution, myself, and all the other staff.

Good evening, 
In disregard of the Court's order, the team leader of Ms. Maxwell's security detail 
informed Ms. Maxwell that she will not have access to the laptop on Saturday. 
(See email below.) 
I will be notifying Judge Nathan of MDC's blatant disregard of the Court's order. 
Perhaps this will move the Court to direct Warden 
to appear and face questions 
concerning the mistreatment of Ms. Maxwell and misconduct by his staff. 
Any assistance you can provide to effect compliance with the order so that Ms. Maxwell 
has access to the laptop over this long holiday weekend is greatly appreciated.

Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
We write on behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, to respectfully request that the Court 
order the Bureau of Prisons to give Ms. Maxwell access to the laptop computer provided by the 
government so that she can review discovery on weekends and holidays. 
At the request of defense counsel, the government provided Ms. Maxwell with a laptop 
computer to review the voluminous discovery, which was produced on a series of external hard 
drives. Currently, Ms. Maxwell is given access to the laptop only on weekdays. On weekends 
and holidays, Ms. Maxwell must use the prison computer on her floor to review discovery. 
However, the prison computer is not equipped with the software necessary to read large portions 
of the discovery recently produced by the government. As a result, Ms. Maxwell loses several 
days of review time every weekend and every holiday because she does not have access to the 
laptop. If Ms. Maxwell is to have any hope of reviewing the millions of documents produced in 
discovery so that she can properly prepare her defense by the July 12, 2021 trial date, she must 
have access to the laptop every day, including weekends and holidays. 
Defense counsel has raised this issue with the government and it has no objection to Ms. 
Maxwell having access to the laptop seven days a week. At the request of defense counsel, the 
government has contacted officials at the MDC on several occasions in the past few weeks to 
request that they lift this restriction, but without success. 
There is no principled justification for this restriction. Ms. Maxwell was given access to 
the laptop every day (including weekends and the Thanksgiving holiday) for the entire 14-day 
period that she was quarantined in her isolation cell in November-December 2020 because she had 
come into close contact with a member of the MDC staff who had tested positive for COVID. In 
addition, the laptop is kept in a locker in the same room where the prison computer is located, so it

The Honorable Alison J. Nathan

Page 2 
would not require any change in Ms. Maxwell's movements to give her the requested access. 
Furthermore, on at least three occasions since she was released from quarantine, Ms. Maxwell's 
security team gave her the laptop to review discovery on the weekend. 
There is clearly no actual impediment preventing the MDC staff from providing Ms. 
Maxwell access to the laptop on weekends and holidays. Given the millions of documents that 
Ms. Maxwell must review before trial in order to prepare her defense, it is critical that she be 
given as much time as possible with the laptop to review the discovery. We therefore respectfully 
request that the Court order the BOP to give Ms. Maxwell access to the laptop on weekends and 
holidays during the hours that she is permitted to review discovery.

Hi 
Would you please take a look at request number 6 below and figure out how to address it? I believe you may need to 
work with 
for some of these issues. 
Thanks,

Subject: Discovery Requests 
>; 
We write to raise a number of discovery issues. Please let us know your position on these issues at your earliest 
convenience. 
1. In our email correspondence on 11/18/2020, you agreed to create a new hard drive containing the entire discovery 
production. We provided you with a 4TB hard drive for that purpose on 11/20/2020. It is very important for Ms. 
Maxwell to have this drive as soon as possible to prepare her defense. Do you have an update on when the drive 
will be ready? 
2. We also informed you that the CD produced on November 18, 2020 did not work on the prison computer at the 
MDC (as you know, the laptop provided to Ms. Maxwell does not have a CD drive). Accordingly, we asked you to 
include the material on the CD in the new 4TB hard drive. We followed-up with you about this issue on December 
30, 2020. Given that the new hard drive is still not ready, we ask that you download the material on the CD onto 
a separate thumb drive or hard drive and provide it as quickly as possible to Ms. Maxwell at the MDC so that she 
can review the materials this weekend. Alternatively, you can provide an external CD drive to Ms. Maxwell at 
the MDC so that she can read the files on the MDC computer. We will provide whatever media device you 
require to facilitate this production. 
3. Unlike the November 9, 2020 discovery cover letter, the November 18, 2020 discovery cover letter (attached) does 
not correlate the Bates numbers to the particular "Subject Device" from which the documents were recovered. 
Instead, the cover letter indicates that the documents came from "SDNY_PROD015" or "SDNY_PROD016." We do 
not know what those terms refer to. We request that the government produce a list that correlates the Bates 
EFTA00021736
--- PAGE 2 ---
numbers for all of the documents in SDNY_PROD015 and SDNY_PROD016 to the particular devices from which the 
documents were recovered. 
4. We request that the government provide an unredacted version of the FBI report, dated December 6, 2006, 
bearing Bates number SDNY_GM_02050812-14 (attached). We also request that the government produce a log 
identifying all of the redacted documents in the discovery and the bases for each of the redactions. 
5. There are a few documents that seem to be missing from the discovery. For example, the AT&T documents 
(SDNY_GM_00001015-3637) do not seem to include subscriber information for the various phone numbers. Also, 
the flight logs produced b' 
begin at Bates number "a00028," 
suggesting that 
'00001-000027 were not produced to us. Please produce these documents to us or provide an 
explanation why you are not producing them to us. Please confirm whether there are other documents that were 
removed from the grand jury subpoena productions that we have not yet identified and the basis for their removal. 
6. There are a few Bates number/metadata issues with some of the documents: 
a. There is an overlap between the fourth and fifth document productions. The fourth production ends at 
SDNY_GM_00328863, the fifth production begins at SDNY_GM_00328070. We propose renumbering the 
range from the fifth production (i.e., renumber SDNY_GM_00328070-328863). 
b. The metadata load files (*.DAT) for PROD011 had a number of gaps which are detailed in the attached Excel 
file. We propose that you send us a new DAT file covering only the missing documents. 
c. The metadata load files (*.DAT) for PROD015 had a gap from SDNY_GM_00723971 to SDNY_GM_00723981. 
We propose that you send us a new DAT file covering only the missing documents. 
7. To the extent that the government has created an index of the documents produced on November 9 and 
November 18 that is more detailed than the production cover letters, we request that you provide a copy to the 
defense. 
8. We request that the government provide copies of the grand jury subpoenas for documents issued by the 
government in this case. Also, please identify the date range of documents you requested in each subpoena. 
There is one other issue we'd like to raise. An article in the Daily Beast on Monday referenced the search warrant affidavit 
for the cell-site simulator used to track Ms. Maxwell's cellphone before her arrest (https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-
the-fbi-tracked-down-ghislaine-maxwell-alleged-madam-of-jeffrey-epstein). The article stated that the affidavit appeared 
in a "newly unsealed court filing." I don't recall this affidavit being unsealed or referenced in anything that was filed on 
the court docket. Please confirm whether or not the government unsealed this affidavit or any other materials from the 
criminal discovery, and whether any discovery materials were released pursuant to FOIA requests.

Thanks very much for being in touch. We had actually planned to be in touch today—we expect that next week we'll be 
having meaningful conversations internally with supervisors about the possible / likely paths forward for aspects of the 
case including Ms. 
. In connection with that expectation, we wanted to ask if you were prepared (and willing) to 
convey to convey your client's recollection regarding the incident described in the complaint 
sent on December 4 
(re-attaching here, specifically at page seven). To the extent you have additional information that would be helpful to 
convey, even minor, we would be available anytime in the coming days to do a call. If that isn't possible until you come 
back, obviously we understand the challenges of scheduling, but we had anticipated trying to see if we could schedule a 
call in the coming days. Please let us know?

Hi 
Attached is an index listing the subpoenas we have sent out and an indication of whether we have received a response. I 
only marked an entry as non-responsive if we received nothing from the entity. For instance, if we received a letter stating 
a lack of records, that was still marked as yes. So for any entry labeled "No", we received nothing. If you have any records 
we are missing please send them over, and if we have any outstanding subpoenas the AUSAs are hoping you can check in 
with the entities. 
Let me know if you have any questions, or if I can be of any help.

As you know, the protective order distinguishes between all discovery and that marked "sensitive," and it is the sensitive 
discovery that cannot be publicly filed. 
statements to law enforcement do not fall into the sensitive 
category, so they should be publicly filed. We'd ask that, consistent with the protective order, any sensitive discovery 
and references to cooperators be redacted in your public filings. Along the same lines, we noticed that you publicly filed 
four documents that were marked sensitive (Exhibits A through D to your cell site motion) in violation of the protective 
order. We will be asking the Court to remove them from the docket and you will need to refile.

It is a little difficult to know what needs to be sealed/redacted in the abstract. Out of an abundance of caution, can you 
file the documents with any reference to evidence/discovery and cooperators redacted? We can then review the 
unredacted version and discuss what, if anything, can be unredacted for the public version.

Our motions will be ready to go out in a few hours., One is straight forward legal argument about the cell tower data, 
which we don't have a problem filing. The other motion deals with the statements to the police and by necessity we 
discuss the statements in detail. We also discuss some of the discovery and the cooperating witnesses. What is the 
Government position about filing that motion under seal? 
Also, 
affidavit hasn't been signed because the only regular access to a notary are members of his legal team and 
we don't want to witness his signature. We will have him sign it through whatever the process is at MCC or in open

As mentioned, the audio transfer is complete. Would you like those files tomorrow, as separate from the

As a follow up to the video lengths, most of the VHS tapes were recorded at slow speed or "extended play". 
This means the length of each tape is 6-hrs (verses 2-hours at normal speed). 
We spoke about preserving the entire tape. Just letting you know in advance. Of course, the estimate will 
reflect these extended times.

The below is from the AUSA 
Video and Audio: 
For the video and audio records, those materials include approximately 22 VHS tapes and 
approximately 49 cassette tapes, each of which needs to be converted, labeled, and indexed, and 
we'll need two copies of each resulting digital file (again, one for us and one for FBI). Those are

picture of which was contained in the report you reviewed at our office), you can arrange to do so by contacting 
the new legal counsel at MCC. You will not be allowed to take photographs of the rope. 
— We have been informed that in the course of its investigation into Mr. Tartaglione's contraband cellphone, BOP created 
forensic reports of the phone and SIM card. We have not obtained or requested copies of these reports. If you would like 
to review the reports, please let us know. In that case, in light of earlier claims of privilege raised by Mr. Barket, we will

AUSAs will coordinate producing the reports to you and will work with you to determine what, if any, portions of the 
report can be provided to the case AUSAs 
— We have been informed by BOP that apart from the photographs contained in the materials you reviewed at our office 
regarding the July 23 incident, no other pictures or videos were taken from inside the Tartaglione/Epstein cell. 
— We have received additional information from BOP regarding the video outside of the Tartaglione/Epstein cell, and we 
will be filing a letter with the Court shortly. As stated in the letter, the video that we have is available for review at our

Maxwell is Alleged to Have Facilitated, Participated in Acts of Abuse 
Additionally Charged With Perjury in Connection With 2016 Depositions 
Audrey Strauss, the Acting United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, William F. Sweeney 
Jr., the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation 
("FBP"), and Dermot Shea, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department ("NYPD"), announced that 
GHISLANE MAXWELL was arrested this morning and charged with enticing a minor to travel to engage in 
criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, conspiracy to 
commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. The Indictment unsealed 
today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 through 1997, MAXWELL and co-conspirator Jeffrey 
Epstein exploited girls as young as 14, including by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the 
purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference for young girls, 
MAXWELL played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations 
including New York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, MAXWELL made several false 
statements in sworn depositions in 2016. MAXWELL is expected to be presented this afternoon in the in 
federal court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan. 
Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated, aided, and participated 
in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then delivered them 
into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust. All the while, 
she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself. Today, after 
many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes."

FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the most 
important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the law 
and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth into 
behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the quest 
for justice has been met with great disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. 
The example set by the women involved has been a powerful one. They persevered against the rich and 
connected, and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a subpoena - and they stood together. I have no doubt the 
bravery exhibited by the women involved here has empowered others to speak up about the crimes of which 
they've been subjected." 
NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said: "The heinous crimes these charges allege are, and always will be 
abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement 
partners, for their continuing commitment to bringing justice to the survivors of sexual assault, everywhere." 
If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, please contact the FBI at 1-
800-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
According to the Indictment[1] unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated in 
Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, 
which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies 
or taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at 
ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's 
behavior. Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to 
accept offers of financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. 
MAXWELL also normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, 
encouraging them to massage Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and susceptible 
to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between minor victims 
and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL was present 
for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages during which a 
minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein involving a minor 
victim where MAXWELL was present. 
As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching of a 
victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to touch 
Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and Epstein's 
victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as well as 
MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made false 
statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex 
acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to 
travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of 
transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, which carries a maximum sentence of 
years in prison, one count of conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual 
activity, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and two counts of perjury, each of which 
carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
The statutory maximum penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational

Ms. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and the NYPD.

NEW YORK CITY — Audrey Strauss, the Acting U.S. Attorney for the Southern

According to the indictment[i] unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
From at least 1994 through at least 1997, Ghislane Maxwell assisted, facilitated, 
and participated in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, 
helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and ultimately abuse victims known to 
Maxwell and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as young as 14

their scheme to abuse minor victims, Maxwell and Epstein enticed and caused

acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of

each of which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.

announced that GHISLANE MAXWELL was arrested this morning and charged with enticing a minor to travel 
to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, 
conspiracy to commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. The Indictment 
unsealed today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 through 1997, MAXWELL and co-conspirator 
Jeffrey Epstein exploited girls as young as 14, including by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the 
EFTA00021787
--- PAGE 2 ---
purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference for young girls, 
MAXWELL played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations 
including New York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, MAXWELL made several false 
statements in sworn depositions in 2016. MAXWELL is expected to be presented this afternoon in the in federal 
court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan. 
Acting U.S. Attorney 
said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated, aided, and 
participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then 
delivered them into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust. 
All the while, she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself. 
Today, after many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the 
most important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the 
law and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth into 
behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the quest for 
justice has been met with great disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. The 
example set by the women involved has been a powerful one. They persevered against the rich and connected, 
and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a subpoena - and they stood together. I have no doubt the bravery 
exhibited by the women involved here has empowered others to speak up about the crimes of which they've been 
subjected." 
NYPD Commissioner 
said: "The heinous crimes these charges allege are, and always will 
be abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement 
partners, for their continuing commitment to bringing justice to the survivors of sexual assault, everywhere." 
If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, please contact 
the FBI at 1-800-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
According to the Indictment[l I unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated 
in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, 
which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies or 
taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at 
ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. 
Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to accept offers of 
financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. MAXWELL also 
normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, encouraging them to massage 
Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and 
susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between 
minor victims and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL 
was present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages 
EFTA00021788
--- PAGE 3 ---
during which a minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein 
involving a minor victim where MAXWELL was present. 
As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching 
of a victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to 
touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and 
Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as 
well as MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal 
sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to 
travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of 
transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, which carries a maximum sentence of 
years in prison, one count of conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual 
activity, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and two counts of perjury, each of which 
carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
The statutory maximum penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational 
purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be determined by the judge. 
Ms. 
praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and the NYPD.

We just wanted to check in very briefly—we had been hopeful that we'd be able to circle back with you earlier, but our 
investigation is currently still ongoing, so at the very least we wanted to let you know that we continue to appreciate

UNITED STATES ATTORNEY'S OFFICE 
Southern District of New York 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL CHARGED IN MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURT FOR 
CONSPIRING WITH JEFFREY EPSTEIN TO SEXUALLY ABUSE MINORS 
Maxwell is Alleged to Have Facilita- ted, Participated in Acts of Abuse 
Additionally Charged With Perjwy in Connection With 2016 Depositions 
Audrey Strauss, the Acting United States Attorney- for the Southern District of New York, William F. 
Sweeney Jr., the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation ("FBI"), and Dermot Shea, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department ("NYPD"), 
announced that GHISLANE MAXWELL was arrested this morning and charged with enticing a minor to travel 
to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, 
conspiracy to commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. The Indictment 
unsealed today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 through 1997, MAXWELL and co-conspirator 
Jeffrey Epstein exploited girls as young as 14, including by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the 
purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference for young girls, 
MAXWELL played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations 
including New York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, MAXWELL made several false 
statements in sworn depositions in 2016. MAXWELL is expected to be presented this afternoon in the in federal 
court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan. 
Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated, aided, and 
participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then 
EFTA00021816
--- PAGE 2 ---
delivered them into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust. 
All the while, she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself. 
Today, after many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the 
most important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the 
law and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth into 
behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the quest for 
justice has been met with great disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. The 
example set by the women involved has been a powerful one. They persevered against the rich and connected, 
and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a subpoena - and they stood together. I have no doubt the bravery 
exhibited by the women involved here has empowered others to speak up about the crimes of which they've been 
subjected." 
NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said: "The heinous crimes these charges allege are, and always will 
be abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement 
partners, for their continuing commitment to bringing justice to the survivors of sexual assault, everywhere." 
If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, please contact 
the FBI at 1-800-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
According to the Indictment[1] unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated 
in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, 
which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies or 
taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at 
ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. 
Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to accept offers of 
financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. MAXWELL also 
normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, encouraging them to massage 
Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and 
susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between 
minor victims and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL 
was present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages 
during which a minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein 
involving a minor victim where MAXWELL was present. 
As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching 
of a victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to 
touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and 
Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as 
well as MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
EFTA00021817
--- PAGE 3 ---
Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal 
sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to 
travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of 
transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, which carries a maximum sentence of 
years in prison, one count of conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual 
activity, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and two counts of perjury, each of which 
carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
The statutory maximum penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational 
purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be determined by the judge. 
Ms. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and the NYPD. 
This case is being handled by the Office's Public Corruption Unit. Assistant U.S. Attorneys 
and 
are in charge of the prosecution. 
The charges contained in the Indictment are merely accusations. The defendant is presumed innocent 
unless and until proven guilty.

Additionally Charged With Perjury in Connection With 2016 Depositions 
Audrey Strauss, the Acting United States Attorney- for the Southern District of New York, William F. 
Sweeney Jr., the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation ("FBI"), and Dermot Shea, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department ("NYPD"), 
announced that GHISLANE MAXWELL was arrested this morning and charged with enticing a minor to travel 
to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, 
conspiracy to commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. The Indictment 
unsealed today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 through 1997, MAXWELL and co-conspirator 
Jeffrey Epstein exploited girls as young as 14, including by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the 
purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference for young girls, 
MAXWELL played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations 
including New York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, MAXWELL made several false 
statements in sworn depositions in 2016. MAXWELL is expected to be presented this afternoon in the in federal 
court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan. 
Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated, aided, and 
participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then 
EFTA00021820
--- PAGE 2 ---
delivered them into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust. 
All the while, she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself. 
Today, after many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the 
most important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the 
law and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth into 
behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the quest for 
justice has been met with great disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. The 
example set by the women involved has been a powerful one. They persevered against the rich and connected, 
and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a subpoena - and they stood together. I have no doubt the bravery 
exhibited by the women involved here has empowered others to speak up about the crimes of which they've been 
subjected." 
NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said: "The heinous crimes these charges allege are, and always will 
be abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement 
partners, for their continuing commitment to bringing justice to the survivors of sexual assault, everywhere." 
If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, please contact 
the FBI at 1-800-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
According to the Indictment[1] unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated 
in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, 
which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies or 
taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at 
ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. 
Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to accept offers of 
financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. MAXWELL also 
normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, encouraging them to massage 
Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and 
susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between 
minor victims and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL 
was present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages 
during which a minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein 
involving a minor victim where MAXWELL was present. 
As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching 
of a victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to 
touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and 
Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as 
well as MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
EFTA00021821
--- PAGE 3 ---
Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal 
sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to 
travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of 
transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, which carries a maximum sentence of 
years in prison, one count of conspiracy to transport a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual 
activity, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, and two counts of perjury, each of which 
carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. 
The statutory maximum penalties are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational 
purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant would be determined by the judge. 
Ms. Strauss praised the outstanding investigative work of the FBI and the NYPD. 
This case is being handled by the Office's Public Corruption Unit. Assistant U.S. Attorneys 
and 
are in charge of the prosecution. 
The charges contained in the Indictment are merely accusations. The defendant is presumed innocent 
unless and until proven guilty.

UNITED STATES ATTORNEY'S OFFICE 
Southern District of New York 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL CHARGED IN MANHATTAN FEDERAL COURT FOR 
CONSPIRING WITH JEFFREY EPSTEIN TO SEXUALLY ABUSE MINORS 
Maxwell is Alleged to Have Facilita- ted, Participated in Acts of Abuse 
Additionally Charged With Perjury in Connection With 2016 Depositions 
Audrey Strauss, the Acting United States Attorney- for the Southern District of New York, William F. 
Sweeney Jr., the Assistant Director-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation ("FBI"), and Dermot Shea, Commissioner of the New York City Police Department ("NYPD"), 
announced that GHISLANE MAXWELL was arrested this morning and charged with enticing a minor to travel 
to engage in criminal sexual activity, transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, 
conspiracy to commit both of those offenses, and perjury in connection with a sworn deposition. The Indictment 
unsealed today alleges that between at least in or about 1994 through 1997, MAXWELL and co-conspirator 
Jeffrey Epstein exploited girls as young as 14, including by enticing them to travel and transporting them for the 
purpose of engaging in illegal sex acts. As alleged, knowing that Epstein had a preference for young girls, 
MAXWELL played a critical role in the grooming and abuse of minor victims that took place in locations 
including New York, Florida, and New Mexico. In addition, as alleged, MAXWELL made several false 
statements in sworn depositions in 2016. MAXWELL is expected to be presented this afternoon in the in federal 
court in New Hampshire. This case is assigned to U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan. 
EFTA00021834

Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: "As alleged, Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated, aided, and 
participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Maxwell enticed minor girls, got them to trust her, and then 
delivered them into the trap that she and Jeffrey Epstein had set. She pretended to be a woman they could trust. 
All the while, she was setting them up to be abused sexually by Epstein and, in some cases, Maxwell herself. 
Today, after many years, Ghislaine Maxwell finally stands charged for her role in these crimes." 
FBI Assistant Director William F. Sweeney Jr. said: "Preserving the innocence of children is among the 
most important responsibilities we carry as adults. Like Epstein, Ms. Maxwell chose to blatantly disregard the 
law and her responsibility as an adult, using whatever means she had at her disposal to lure vulnerable youth into 
behavior they should never have been exposed to, creating the potential for lasting harm. We know the quest for 
justice has been met with great disappointment for the victims, and that reliving these events is traumatic. The 
example set by the women involved has been a powerful one. They persevered against the rich and connected, 
and they did so without a badge, a gun, or a subpoena - and they stood together. I have no doubt the bravery 
exhibited by the women involved here has empowered others to speak up about the crimes of which they've been 
subjected." 
NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said: "The heinous crimes these charges allege are, and always will 
be abhorrent for the lasting trauma they inflict on victims. I commend our investigators, and law enforcement 
partners, for their continuing commitment to bringing justice to the survivors of sexual assault, everywhere." 
If you believe you are a victim of the sexual abuse perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein, please contact 
the FBI at 1400-CALL FBI, and reference this case. 
According to the Indictment[ I I unsealed today in Manhattan federal court: 
From at least 1994 through at least 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and participated 
in Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, helping Jeffrey Epstein to recruit, groom, and 
ultimately abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age of 18. The victims were as 
young as 14 years old when they were groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
that their victims were in fact minors. As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to abuse minor victims, 
MAXWELL and Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to Epstein's residences in different states, 
which MAXWELL knew and intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to sexual abuse. 
As alleged, MAXWELL enticed and groomed minor girls to be abused in multiple ways. For example, 
MAXWELL attempted to befriend certain victims by asking them about their lives, taking them to the movies or 
taking them on shopping trips, and encouraging their interactions with Epstein. MAXWELL also acclimated 
victims to Epstein's conduct simply by being present for victim interactions with Epstein, which put victims at 
ease by providing the assurance and comfort of an adult woman who seemingly approved of Epstein's behavior. 
Additionally, to make victims feel indebted to Epstein, MAXWELL would encourage victims to accept offers of 
financial assistance from Epstein, including offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. MAXWELL also 
normalized and facilitated sexual abuse by discussing sexual topics with victims, encouraging them to massage 
Epstein, and undressing in front of a victim. 
As MAXWELL and Epstein intended, these grooming behaviors left minor victims vulnerable and 
susceptible to sexual abuse by Epstein. MAXWELL was then present for certain sexual encounters between 
minor victims and Epstein, such as interactions where a minor victim was undressed, and ultimately MAXWELL 
was present for sex acts perpetrated by Epstein on minor victims. That abuse included sexualized massages 
during which a minor victim was fully or partially nude, as well as group sexualized massages of Epstein 
involving a minor victim where MAXWELL was present. 
As alleged, minor victims were subjected to sexual abuse that included, among other things, the touching 
of a victim's breasts or genitals, placing a sex toy such a vibrator on a victim's genitals, directing a victim to 
touch Epstein while he masturbated, and directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. MAXWELL and 
EFTA00021835
--- PAGE 3 ---
Epstein's victims were groomed or abused at Epstein's residences in New York, Florida, and New Mexico, as 
well as MAXWELL's residence in London, England. 
Additionally, in 2016, while testifying under oath in a civil proceeding, MAXWELL repeatedly made 
false statements, including about certain specific acts and events alleged in the Indictment. 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 58, is charged with one count of enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal 
sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of conspiracy to entice a minor to 
travel to engage in illegal sex acts, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, one count of

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
SUPERSEDING INDICTMENT 
S1 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 
Defendant. 
x 
COUNT ONE 
(Conspiracy to Entice Minors to Travel to Engage in 
Illegal Sex Acts) 
The Grand Jury charges: 
OVERVIEW 
1. 
The charges set forth herein stem from the role 
of GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, in the sexual exploitation 
and abuse of multiple minor girls by Jeffrey Epstein. In 
particular, from at least in or about 1994, up to and including 
at least in or about 1997, MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and 
contributed to Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among 
other things, helping Epstein to recruit, groom, and ultimately 
abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age 
of 18. The victims were as young as 14 years old when they were 
groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
that certain victims were in fact under the age of 18. 
2. 
As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to 
abuse minor victims, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, and 
Jeffrey Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to 
EFTA00021843

tAZNDmaritithitoiP-
iigdEgigt7g4d2Qoalaeleol 81319 
Epstein's residences in different states, which MAXWELL knew and 
intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to 
sexual abuse. Moreover, in an effort to conceal her crimes, 
MAXWELL repeatedly lied when questioned about her conduct, 
including in relation to some of the minor victims described 
herein, when providing testimony under oath in 2016. 
FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
3. 
During the time periods charged in this 
Indictment, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, had a personal and 
professional relationship with Jeffrey Epstein and was among his 
closest associates. In particular, between in or about 1994 and 
in or about 1997, MAXWELL was in an intimate relationship with 
Epstein and also was paid by Epstein to manage his various 
properties. Over the course of their relationship, MAXWELL and 
Epstein were photographed together on multiple occasions, 
including in the below image:

4. 
Beginning in at least 1994, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 
the defendant, enticed and groomed multiple minor girls to 
engage in sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein, through a variety of 
means and methods, including but not limited to the following: 
a. 
MAXWELL first attempted to befriend some of 
Epstein's minor victims prior to their abuse, including by 
asking the victims about their lives, their schools, and their 
families. MAXWELL and Epstein would spend time building 
friendships with minor victims by, for example, taking minor 
victims to the movies or shopping. Some of these outings would 
involve MAXWELL and Epstein spending time together with a minor 
victim, while some would involve MAXWELL or Epstein spending 
time alone with a minor victim. 
b. 
Having developed a rapport with a victim, 
MAXWELL would try to normalize sexual abuse for a minor victim 
by, among other things, discussing sexual topics, undressing in 
front of the victim, being present when a minor victim was 
undressed, and/or being present for sex acts involving the minor 
victim and Epstein. 
c. 
MAXWELL'S presence during minor victims' 
interactions with Epstein, including interactions where the 
minor victim was undressed or that 
Epstein, helped put the victims at 
was present. For example, in some 
involved sex acts with 
ease because an adult woman

massage Epstein in front of a minor victim. In other instances, 
MAXWELL encouraged minor victims to provide massages to Epstein, 
including sexualized massages during which a minor victim would 
be fully or partially nude. Many of those massages resulted in 
Epstein sexually abusing the minor victims. 
d. 
In addition, Epstein offered to help some 
minor victims by paying for travel and/or educational 
opportunities, and MAXWELL encouraged certain victims to accept 
Epstein's assistance. As a result, victims were made to feel 
indebted and believed that MAXWELL and Epstein were trying to 
help them.

Through this process, MAXWELL and Epstein 
to engage in sexual activity with Epstein. In 
MAXWELL was present for and participated in the 
minor victims. Some such incidents occurred in 
the context of massages, which developed into sexual encounters. 
5. 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, facilitated 
Jeffrey Epstein's access to minor victims knowing that he had a 
sexual preference for underage girls and that he intended to 
engage in sexual activity with those victims. Epstein's 
resulting abuse of minor victims included, among other things, 
touching a victim's breast, touching a victim's genitals, 
placing a sex toy such as a vibrator on a victim's genitals,

MAXWELL AND EPSTEIN'S VICTIMS 
6. 
Between approximately in or about 1994 and in or 
about 1997, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, facilitated 
Jeffrey Epstein's access to minor victims by, among other 
things, inducing and enticing, and aiding and abetting the 
inducement and enticement of, multiple minor victims. Victims 
were groomed and/or abused at multiple locations, including the 
following: 
a. 
A a multi-story private residence on the 
Upper East Side of Manhattan, New York owned by Epstein (the 
"New York Residence"), which is depicted in the following

7. 
Among the victims induced or enticed by GHISLAINE 
MAXWELL, the defendant, were minor victims identified herein as 
Minor Victim-1, Minor Victim-2, and Minor Victim-3. In 
particular, and during time periods relevant to this Indictment, 
MAXWELL engaged in the following acts, among others, with 
respect to minor victims: 
a. 
MAXWELL met Minor Victim-1 when Minor 
Victim-1 was approximately 14 years old. MAXWELL subsequently 
interacted with Minor Victim-1 on multiple occasions at 
Epstein's residences, knowing that Minor Victim-1 was under the 
age of 18 at the time. During these interactions, which took 
place between approximately 1994 and 1997, MAXWELL groomed Minor 
Victim-1 to engage in sexual acts with Epstein through multiple 
means. First, MAXWELL and Epstein attempted to befriend Minor 
Victim-1, taking her to the movies and on shopping trips. 
MAXWELL also asked Minor Victim-1 about school, her classes, her 
family, and other aspects of her life. MAXWELL then sought to 
normalize inappropriate and abusive conduct by, among other 
things, undressing in front of Minor Victim-1 and being present 
when Minor Victim-1 undressed in front of Epstein. Within the 
first year after MAXWELL and Epstein met Minor Victim-1, Epstein 
began sexually abusing Minor Victim-1. MAXWELL was present for 
EFTA00021849

and involved in some of this abuse. In particular, MAXWELL 
involved Minor Victim-1 in group sexualized massages of Epstein. 
During those group sexualized massages, MAXWELL and/or Minor 
Victim-1 would engage in sex acts with Epstein. Epstein and 
MAXWELL both encouraged Minor Victim-1 to travel to Epstein's 
residences in both New York and Florida. As a result, Minor 
Victim-1 was sexually abused by Epstein in both New York and 
Florida. Minor Victim-1 was enticed to travel across state 
lines for the purpose of sexual encounters with Epstein, and 
MAXWELL was aware that Epstein engaged in sexual activity with 
Minor Victim-1 after Minor-Victim-1 traveled to Epstein's 
properties, including in the context of a sexualized massage. 
b. 
MAXWELL interacted with Minor Victim-2 on at 
least one occasion in or about 1996 at Epstein's residence in 
New Mexico when Minor Victim-2 was under the age of 18. Minor 
Victim-2 had flown into New Mexico from out of state at 
Epstein's invitation for the purpose of being groomed for and/or 
subjected to acts of sexual abuse. MAXWELL knew that Minor 
Victim-2 was under the age of 18 at the time. While in New 
Mexico, MAXWELL and Epstein took Minor Victim-2 to a movie and 
MAXWELL took Minor Victim-2 shopping. MAXWELL also discussed 
Minor Victim-2's school, classes, and family with Minor Victim-
2. In New Mexico, MAXWELL began her efforts to groom Minor 
Victim-2 for abuse by Epstein by, among other things, providing

an unsolicited massage to Minor Victim-2, during which Minor 
Victim-2 was topless. MAXWELL also encouraged Minor Victim-2 to 
massage Epstein. 
c. 
MAXWELL groomed and befriended Minor 
Victim-3 in London, England between approximately 1994 and 1995, 
including during a period of time in which MAXWELL knew that 
Minor Victim-3 was under the age of 18. Among other things, 
MAXWELL discussed Minor Victim-3's life and family with Minor 
Victim-3. MAXWELL introduced Minor Victim-3 to Epstein and 
arranged for multiple interactions between Minor Victim-3 and 
Epstein. During those interactions, MAXWELL encouraged Minor 
Victim-3 to massage Epstein, knowing that Epstein would engage 
in sex acts with Minor Victim-3 during those massages. Minor 
Victim-3 provided Epstein with the requested massages, and 
during those massages, Epstein sexually abused Minor Victim-3. 
MAXWELL was aware that Epstein engaged in sexual activity with 
Minor Victim-3 on multiple occasions, including at times when 
Minor Victim-3 was under the age of 18, including in the context 
of a sexualized massage. 
MAXWELL'S EFFORTS TO CONCEAL HER CONDUCT 
8. 
In or around 2016, in the context of a deposition 
as part of civil litigation, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, 
repeatedly provided false and perjurious statements, under oath, 
regarding, among other subjects, her role in facilitating the

Re: Reconsideration of the Court's July 23 Ruling 
Giuffre v. Ghislaine Maxwell, No. 15 Civ. 7433 (LAP) 
Dear Judge Preska: 
As counsel for Ms. Maxwell we write to request that the Court vindicate its Protective Order 
and punish its violation. Ms. Maxwell's two deposition transcripts were designated 
"Confidential" and subject to the protection of the Protective Order. Both transcripts ended 
up in the hands of the government, which used them to bring an indictment against 
Ms. Maxwell, charging her with, among other things, perjury in her deposition testimony. 
This is a serious violation of the Protective Order, and merits the commencement of contempt 
proceedings. 
We also write to seek reconsideration of the Court's July 23, 2020 ruling concluding that the 
transcripts of Ms. Maxwell's April 2016 deposition and Doe 1's deposition should be unsealed 
in their entirety (with the exception of non-party names). We recognize that a reconsideration 
motion is an extraordinary request, but we suggest it is appropriate under the circumstances. 
There are new facts since Ms. Maxwell lodged her objections to the unsealing of the transcript 
of her deposition, and there is a need to correct clear error or prevent manifest injustice 
relating to the unsealing of the transcript. 
We respectfully request that the Court keep sealed Ms. Maxwell's and Doe l's deposition 
transcripts and any sealed or redacted order or paper that quotes from or discloses information 
from the transcripts ("deposition material"). We do not seek unnecessary delay; however, if 
the Court denies our request for reconsideration, we do wish to seek relief from the Second 
Circuit. Accordingly, in the event the Court denies this reconsideration request, we ask that 
the Court stay any unsealing of the deposition material for at least two business days to give us 
time to apply to the Second Circuit for a stay of the unsealing order pending appeal. As the

courts have recognized, temporary stays of unseal orders are appropriate so that "[t]he genie 
is [not] out of the bottle," Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d 133, 144 (2d Cir. 2004), 
before the interested parties have an opportunity to seek review of the orders. See, e.g., United 
Staten. Martoma, No. Si 12 CR 973 PGG, 2014 WL 164181, at •8 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 9, 2014) 
("The Court stays immediate disclosure of these materials to permit Defendant to make 
application to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit for a more extended stay."); 
Brown v. Maxwell, 929 F.3d 41, 54 (2d. Cir. 2019) (recognizing likelihood of future appeals in 
this matter). 
1. There are new, intervening and significant facts since briefing closed on the first round 
of review of sealed materials. After many months of relentless negative media coverage of 
Mr. Epstein and allegations that Ms. Maxwell was involved in his criminal activities, the 
government secured an indictment against her. On July 2, one day after Ms. Maxwell filed her 
reply in support of her objection to unsealing documents containing references to Does 1 and 
2, the government staged a dramatic, forced entry at dawn into her home and arrested her. 
EXHIBIT A, at 3. 
Immediately after Ms. Maxwell's arrest, Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss held a press 
conference and made numerous comments attacking Ms. Maxwell's credibility and expressing 
her opinion of Ms. Maxwell's guilt, e.g., that she was guilty of "I[ying] " in her deposition 
"because the truth, as alleged, was almost unspeakable." Id Plaintiff's counsel piled on, 
offering their own opinions about Ms. Maxwell's guilt. For example, Mr. Edwards opined that 
Ms. Maxwell was "a main facilitator" of Mr. Epstein's crimes who "started the whole thing." 
Id Ms. McCawley praised the prosecutors: "[They] have done an incredible job and they're 
being very meticulous, they want to make sure that the Indictments stick. ... They took a lot 
of time to be very careful and thoughtful and that gives me a lot of hope that [Ms. Maxwell] 
will remain in prison for the remainder of her life. ... [Ms. Maxwell] was really the central 
figure ...." Id at 6. 
Ms. Maxwell's motion for an order barring such extrajudicial comments led Judge Nathan to 
admonish "counsel for all involved parties [to] exercise great care to ensure compliance with 
this Court's local rules, including Local Criminal Rule 23.1, and the rules of professional 
responsibility." EXHIBIT B. She further " warn[ed] counsel and agents for the parties and 
counsel for potential witnesses that going forward it will not hesitate to take appropriate action 
in the face of violations of any relevant rules." Id. judge Nathan said she would ensure "strict 
compliance" with the rules and "ensure that the Defendant's right to a fair trial will be 
safeguarded." Id. 
On July 8 the government filed a superseding indictment alleging that Ms. Maxwell "assisted, 
facilitated, and contributed" to Mr. Epstein's abuse of minors. The indictment quickly turned 
to this civil action, alleging that in 2016 Ms. Maxwell made "efforts to conceal her conduct" 
EFTA00021862
--- PAGE 3 ---
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1078 Filed 07/29/20 Page 3 of 9 
Honorable Loretta A. Preska 
July 29, 2020 
Page 3 
by "repeatedly provid[ing] false and perjurious statements" in deposition testimony. 
EXHIBIT C 9 8. 
Quoting verbatim from Ms. Maxwell's April 2016 deposition transcript, the indictment alleges 
Ms. Maxwell gave false testimony (a) when she testified "I don't know what you're talking 
about" in response to a question whether Mr. Epstein "ha[d] a scheme to recruit underage 
girls for sexual massages ... [i]f you know"; and (b) when she testified, "I'm not aware of 
anybody that I interacted with [other than plaintiff] who was 17 at this point." Id. 121. None 
of these questions and answers was used in the summary judgment papers or released by the 
Second Circuit. The transcript containing this testimony is sealed. 
2. The Court should commence proceedings to vindicate the government and plaintiff's 
violation of the Protective Order. Only two parties—plaintiff and Ms. Maxwell—and their 
counsel had proper access to the transcripts of Ms. Maxwell's deposition. The transcripts, 
which were designated "Confidential," were the subject of the Protective Order strictly 
limiting the persons to whom the parties may disclose "Confidential" -designated documents. 
For example, the parties could only disclose such documents to "attorneys actively working 
on this case" and "persons regularly employed or associated with the attorneys who are 
working on this case." Doc.62, quoted in Doc.1071 at 3. This language was negotiated by the 
parties to specifically exclude an exception for investigations by law enforcement. 
On February 26, 2016, counsel for plaintiff proposed protective order language that would 
have allowed for a "law enforcement" exception: Paragraph I(a)4 of plaintiff's draft proposed 
that: "CONFIDENTIAL information shall not be disclosed or used for any purpose except the 
preparation and trial of this case and any related matter, including but not limited to, 
investigations by law enforcement." See Exhibit D at 3. This language was rejected by Ms. 
Maxwell because of her concerns that plaintiff and her lawyers were acting as either express or 
de facto agents of the Government. The language agreed upon, and made an Order of this 
Court specifically excluded an exception for law enforcement. Had the language not been 
made an order of the Court, Ms. Maxwell would have proceeded in a different fashion. She 
relied on this language and the protection afforded to her by this Court under established 
Second Circuit law. 
In its Order dated July 1, 2020, the Court said it was "troubled" to learn that plaintiff's 
successor counsel, Cooper & Kirk, had received from plaintiff's former counsel, Boies Schiller 
Flexner, various discovery materials that were subject to the Protective Order. Doc.1071 at 4. 
The Court rejected Cooper & Kirk's suggestion that it properly was a recipient of the material: 
[W]hatever Cooper & Kirk's intentions in requesting and obtaining the 
Maxwell materials from Boies Schiller, the Maxwell Protective Order explicitly 
provides that (1) discovery materials designated CONFIDENTIAL cannot be

Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1078 Filed 07/29/20 Page 4 of 9

Page 4 
disclosed or used outside of the Maxwell action and (2) that properly designated 
discovery materials may only be disclosed to speafic groups of individuals, 
including attorneys "actively working on" the Maxwell litigation. 
Doc.1071 at 4-5 (emphasis supplied) 
Five things are plain. One, as the indictment and superseding indictment establish, the 
government has a copy of the transcripts from Ms. Maxwell's April and July 2016 depositions, 
both of which were designated "Confidential." Two, the government had no ability legally to 
obtain the deposition transcripts. In Martindell v. International Telephone and Telegraph Corp., 
594 F.2d 291, 293 (2d Cir. 1979), cited with approval in In re Teligent, Inc., 640 F.3d 53, 58 (2d 
Cir. 2011), the government moved in a civil action to which it was not a party for access to 
transcripts of depositions twelve witnesses, including some of the civil defendants. The 
government said it was investigating possible violations of federal criminal laws, including 
perjury, subornation of perjury, obstruction of justice and conspiracy. The government: 
speculated that the pretrial deposition testimony might be relevant to its 
investigation into matters similar to those that had been the subject of the 
Martindell action and might be useful in appraising the credibility, accuracy and 
completeness of testimony given by witnesses in the Government's 
investigation or might provide additional information of use to the 
Government. The Government, moreover, feared that unless it could obtain 
the deposition transcripts, it would be unable to secure statements from the 
witnesses because they would claim their Fifth Amendment rights in any 
investigative interviews by the Government. 
594 F.2d at 293. The district court denied the government's request, holding that "the 
deposition testimony had been given in reliance upon the protective order, thus rendering 
unnecessary invocation by the witnesses of their Fifth Amendment rights, that the requested 
turnover would raise constitutional issues, and that principles of fairness mandated 
enforcement of the protective order." Id. The Second Circuit affirmed: 
In the present case the deponents testified in reliance upon the Rule 26(c) 
protective order, absent which they may have refused to testify.... [T]he 
witnesses were entitled to rely upon the terms of a concededly valid protective 
order and Judge Conner did not abuse his discretion in refusing to vacate or 
modify that order. 
M at 296-97. 
Three, the government did not obtain a copy of the deposition transcripts from Ms. Maxwell 
or her counsel. Four, following plaintiff's counsel's admitted violation of the Protective Order

Honorable Loretta A. Preska 
July 29, 2020 
Page 5 
earlier this month, it is clear now that there has been a second violation of the Protective Order 
in a manner consistent with the plaintiff's intent and goals—namely, the prosecution of 
Ms. Maxwell and the pursuit of a sentence that would imprison her "for the remainder of her 
life," EXHIBIT A, at 3. Five, no one should be permitted to violate this Court's Protective 
Order with impunity. 
As it did in connection with plaintiff's violation of the Protective Order via her attorneys, the 
Court should enter orders to determine the nature and extent of the violation of the Order, 
identify those persons who violated the Order, and impose appropriate sanctions. Until this 
process is completed, the Court should stay any disclosure of the transcripts of Ms. Maxwell's 
deposition and deposition material. We respectfully submit that in the event the Court finds a 
violation of the Protective Order, this Court should direct the government to return to the 
Court any copies of the deposition transcripts and enter an order to show cause why the 
person(s) who violated the Order should not be held in contempt. See, e.g., Blum v. Schlegel, 
108 F.3d 1369 (2d Cir. 1997); Hunt v. Enzo Biochem, Inc., 904 F. Supp. 2d 337, 340 (S.D.N.Y. 
2012). 
3. The indictment provides a compelling reason not to unseal the transcript of 
Ms. Maxwell's deposition. That Ms. Maxwell was under criminal investigation, the Court 
ruled, "is not entitled to much weight here." Tr. of July 23 Hearing, at 5. The Court said 
Ms. Maxwell had not explained how the sealed material could inappropriately influence 
potential witnesses or victims. Id The effect of Ms. Maxwell's indictment, arrest, upcoming 
trial and of Judge Nathan's efforts to ensure a fair trial was not discussed in our objections 
since none of these things had happened before briefing was closed. 
Two cases are instructive. In each the courts indicated that in deciding whether to unseal 
materials it was important to give weight to the impact on a criminal defendant's right to a fair 
trial. In Nixon v. Warner Communications, Inc., 435 U.S. 589 (1978), a number of media moved 
the district court to release audio tapes admitted into evidence in the trial of four of President 
Nixon's former advisors. The media intended to copy the tapes for broadcasting and sale to 
the public. District Judge Sirica denied the motion, principally on the ground that the rights of 
the four defendants, who had been convicted and had filed notices of appeal, would be 
prejudiced if they prevailed in their appeals. 435 U.S. at 595, 602 n.14. Judge Sirica noted that 
the transcripts of the audio tapes had been released to the public. Id at 595. The D.C. Circuit 
Court of Appeals held Judge Sirica abused his discretion. 
The Supreme Court reversed the court of appeals and rejected the media's arguments that 
release of the tapes was required under the common law right of access and the First 
Amendment. The Court noted apparently with approval that (a) "Judge Sirica 's view" that 
"the public's `right to know' did not ... overcome the need to safeguard the defendants' 
rights on appeal," and (b) "Judge Sirica's principal reason for refusing to release the tapes

[was] fairness to the defendants, who were appealing their convictions." Li at 595, 602 n.14. 
The Court indicated that the public interest in access to the tapes properly was balanced 
against "the duty of the courts," a at 602, including the duty to ensure fairness to the 
defendants, see id. at 602 n.14. 
In In reNew York Times Co., 828 F.2d 110 (2d Cir. 1987), cited with approval in United States v. 
Longueuil, 567 Fed. App'x 13,16 (2d Cir. 2014), Judge Weinstein denied the media's motion 
to unseal papers filed in connection with an unsuccessful defense motion to suppress evidence 
obtained by electronic surveillance. He found that "defendants' interest in a fair trial and the 
interests of third parties [referenced in] the motion papers justified continued sealing of the 
papers." 828 F.2d at 112; see la at 112 (defendants opposed unsealing on the grounds it would 
prejudice their Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial, their privacy rights, and third parties' 
privacy rights). The Second Circuit vacated the order in part because "the wholesale sealing" 
of the motion papers was "more extensive than necessary to protect defendants' fair trial 
rights, their privacy rights, and the third persons' privacy interests. Id at 116. The court 
noted, "now that the jury has been impaneled, defendants' fair trial rights can certainly be 
adequately protected by sequestration." /et 
In Nixon and New York Times, the courts properly were concerned about the effect of 
unsealing materials notwithstanding that they were core judicial documents—audio tapes 
admitted into evidence at the merits trial and motion papers seeking suppression of evidence 
which the judge denied. And the courts continued to hold these concerns even after the 
defendants had been convicted and had launched appeals (Nixon) and after the petit jury had 
been empaneled (New York Times). 
The courts have recognized that the right to a fair criminal trial is a compelling interest in 
"weighing the interests advanced by the parties in light of the public interests and the duty of 
the courts," Nixon, 435 U.S. at 602. See United States v. Cicale, No. 05-CR-60-2 (NGG), 2018 
WL 388941, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 11, 2018) ("Compelling interests warranting closure of a 
courtroom—and, by extension, sealing of court documents— `may include the defendant's 
right to a fair trial ....' ") (quoting with alterations United States a Doe, 63 F.3d 121, 128 (2d 
Cir. 1995)); United States v. Martoma, No. Si 12 CR 973 PGG, 2014 WL 164181, at *4 
(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 9, 2014) ("A court's conclusion that a qualified First Amendment right of 
access to certain judicial documents exists does not end the inquiry, however. `Courts must

interests."); United States a McVeigh,119 F.3d 806, 813 (10th Cir. 1997) (upholding district 
court's sealing of discovery materials deemed inadmissible at trial, holding that "disclosure of 
such [materials] would play a negative role in the functioning of the criminal process, by 
exposing the public generally, as well as potential jurors, to incriminating evidence that the law 
has determined may not be used to support a conviction"), cited with approval in United States 
v. Avenatti , (S1) 19 CR 373 PGG, 2020 WL 70952, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 6, 2020). 
Based on these cases, the Court may make specific findings supporting the sealing of 
Ms. Maxwell's deposition transcript: The Court may take judicial notice, as Judge Nathan 
herself may have, of the widespread negative media publicity and speculation directed at 
Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell. See Condit v. Dunne, 317 F. Supp. 2d 344, 358 (S.D.N.Y. 2004). 
We attach a compilation of such articles in EXHIBIT E. The Court also may take judicial 
notice of Ms. Maxwell's arrest and indictment, and the government's charge against her based 
on her answers in a deposition transcript that was subject to this Court's Protective Order. 
The unsealing of Ms. Maxwell's deposition transcript would result in substantial negative 
media publicity and speculation in an internet world in the same way that Judge Sirica found 
release of the audio tapes in Nixon would generate publicity and affect those defendants' right 
to a fair trial. And the Court may take judicial notice of Judge Nathan's own concerns about 
the need for counsel for the parties and witnesses in the criminal case to comply with Local 
Criminal Rule 23.1 to "safeguard" and "protect [Ms. Maxwell's] right to a fair trial by an 
impartial jury," EXHIBIT C. The public's right of access to Ms. Maxwell's deposition 
transcript is substantially outweighed by the compelling interest in ensuring her right to a fair 
trial. Particularly is this true in light of the other countervailing interests discussed in our 
objection papers and below. 
4. The deposition transcripts obtained by the government and the indictment's perjury 
counts place in a new light plaintiff's earlier litigation conduct—suggesting the planned 
use of Ms. Maxwell's deposition as a perjury trap. Throughout much of the first year of 
this litigation plaintiff through her counsel had represented to the Court and defense counsel 
that plaintiff was privy to and participating in an ongoing criminal investigation in which 
Ms. Maxwell was a "person of interest." Doc.101 at 2. Toward that end plaintiff withheld 
documents responsive to defense discovery requests for any documents relating to such a 
criminal investigation; plaintiff asserted such documents were subject to a law enforcement, 
"investigative" or public interest "privilege." Id at 2-3. In response to Ms. Maxwell's motion 
to compel the production of documents, plaintiff submitted the "law enforcement materials" 
ex parte and in camera to the Court. Doc.128. Ms. Maxwell objected to the submission of the 
materials ex parte and in camera. Doc.130. The Court denied the motion to compel. Doc. 264-1. 
The materials never have been produced to the defense. 
Based on plaintiff's claim of an ongoing investigation, Ms. Maxwell requested, prior to her 
deposition, that plaintiff disclose any alleged "on-going criminal investigation by law 
EFTA00021867
--- PAGE 8 ---
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1078 Filed 07/29/20 Page 8 of 9 
Honorable Loretta A. Preska 
July 29, 2020 
Page 8 
enforcement" or alternatively to stay this action pending completion of any such investigation. 
Doc.101. In part, Ms. Maxwell needed information concerning any such investigation to 
assess "the impact on any 5th Amendment privilege." ki. at 2, 4-5. Judge Sweet denied that 
motion. The day before Ms. Maxwell's deposition, the Court ordered that "[a]ny materials 
that the plaintiff has with respect to any criminal investigations will be turned over [by 
plaintiff] except for any statements made by plaintiff to law enforcement authority." Tr. of 
Apr. 21, 2016 at 21. Plaintiff produced no such materials and Ms. Maxwell was deposed the 
next day. In reliance on the protective order which included no exception for any law 
enforcement need or subpoena and based on plaintiff's failure to disclose any "on-going 
criminal investigation," she did not assert the 5th Amendment during that deposition. 
This background is given a new context in light of (a) the provision of the sealed transcripts to 
the government without court authorization and (b) the indictment and perjury charges lodged 
against Ms. Maxwell based upon the transcripts. Under Martindell, decided forty years ago 
and still binding precedent in this district, it is settled law that the government may not breach 
a protective order to gain access to deposition transcripts in a civil lawsuit. As the Second 
Circuit held in that case, the government "may not ... simply by picking up the telephone or 
writing a letter to the court ... insinuate itself into a private civil lawsuit between others." 594 
F.2d at 294. The court rejected the government's argument that the district court's 
"solicitude for the witnesses' Fifth Amendment" over the government's desire for the 
deposition transcripts was an abuse of discretion. It held that "a more significant 
counterbalancing factor" is the civil rules' goal of encouraging witnesses to participate in civil 
litigation: 
Unless a valid Rule 26(c) protective order is to be fully and fairly enforceable, 
witnesses relying upon such orders will be inhibited from giving essential 
testimony in civil litigation, thus undermining a procedural system that has 
been successfully developed over the years for disposition of civil differences. 
In short, witnesses might be expected frequently to refuse to testify pursuant to 
protective orders if their testimony were to be made available to the 
Government for criminal investigatory purposes in disregard of those orders. 
594 F.2d at 296. After balancing the interests at stake, the court held that absent improvidence 
in issuing the protective order or some extraordinary circumstance or compelling need, 
witnesses must be permitted to rely on the protective order's enforceability. Id. The protective 
order should not be vacated or modified "to accommodate the Government's desire to inspect 
protected testimony for possible use in a criminal investigation, either as evidence or as the 
subject of a possible perjury charge." ki. (emphasis supplied). 
The procedural history of this litigation culminating in plaintiff's gratuitously attaching the 
entire transcripts of both Ms. Maxwell's depositions to court submissions, and leaking or 
EFTA00021868
--- PAGE 9 ---
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1078 Filed 07/29/20 Page 9 of 9

Page 9 
causing someone to leak the transcripts to the government, which then charged Ms. Maxwell 
with perjury counts, suggest plaintiff in conjunction with the government sought to 
circumvent Martindell: they set a perjury trap for Ms. Maxwell when plaintiff took her 
deposition. Ms. Maxwell requests that this Court examine the law enforcement materials 
submitted ex pane and in camera in connection with its vindication of the Protective Order. In 
the meantime we respectfully submit it is appropriate to maintain the seal over the 
depositions. 
5. Ms. Maxwell's reliance on the Protective Order is entitled to substantial weight. In its 
July 23 ruling the Court did not address a substantial ground Ms. Maxwell asserted in support 
of her objection to unsealing her deposition transcript. The first countervailing interest 
Ms. Maxwell presented was that she reasonably relied on the Protective Order in disclosing 
intimate information about her personal life. Doc.1057 at 4-5. As we pointed out, id. at 5, even 
without any evidentiary or other showing from an interested party, the Second Circuit in 
Brown v. Maxwell protected from disclosure "deposition responses concerning intimate 
matters where the questions were likely only permitted—and the responses only compelled—
because of a strong expectation of continued confidentiality."929 F.3d 41, 48 n.22 (2d Cir 
2019). The Protective Order was entered before Ms. Maxwell's deposition was taken; in fact 
plaintiff's counsel explicitly consented to the Order because "'I just want [Ms. Maxwell's] 
deposition .... It is that important to me." Doc.1073 at 8 (quoting Doc.66 at 9). The Court 
may make specific findings supporting the sealing of the transcript based on the information 
Ms. Maxwell supplied from the court submissions. See id We incorporate by reference here 
the facts asserted and arguments made in the objection and reply in support of this 
countervailing interest. 
For the foregoing reasons we respectfully request that the Court reconsider its decision to 
unseal (1) the transcripts of Ms. Maxwell's and Doe l's depositions, and (2) court submissions 
excerpting from, quoting from or summarizing the contents of the transcripts. 
Very truly yours, 
Ty Gee

ELECTRONICALLY PILED 
DOC I: 
DATE. FILED:7/23/2020

ORDER 
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
The Defense has moved for an order "prohibiting the Government, its agents and counsel 
for witnesses from making extrajudicial statements concerning this case." Dkt. No. 27 at 1. 
The Court firmly expects that counsel for all involved parties will exercise great care to 
ensure compliance with this Court's local rules, including Local Criminal Rule 23.1, and the 
rules of professional responsibility. In light of this clear expectation, the Court does not believe 
that further action is needed at this time to protect the Defendant's right to a fair trial by an 
impartial jury. Accordingly, it denies the Defendant's motion without prejudice. But the Court 
warns counsel and agents for the parties and counsel for potential witnesses that going forward it 
will not hesitate to take appropriate action in the face of violations of any relevant rules. The 
Court will ensure strict compliance with those rules and will ensure that the Defendant's right to 
a fair trial will be safeguarded. 
SO ORDERED.

Also, I know we disagree on this (a non-passive-aggressive instance of "reasonable minds can disagree"l), so just in the 
interest of transparency I think there's case law that strongly suggests we need to disclose the victim names. I'll send that

I think 
is particularly swamped this week —can you please take the lead on whatever we're going to do with this 
(i.e., presumably whatever the chiefs decide)? My personal vote would be to tell them that the protective order explicitly 
precludes the use of criminal grand jury materials in Maxwell's civil cases, and the materials are sealed because they 
relate to an ongoing grand jury investigation and they should feel free to raise the issue with Nathan and we'll respond. 
(And I would think our response could basically be a copy-paste of the letter I wrote to Netburn.) We could also note in 
our response to Jeff and Laura, if we wanted to, that given their awareness of the materials, we assume they will retract 
the obviously false claims about government malfeasance. 
All that said, I also wouldn't object if they just want to allow them to file these materials under seal; I don't think it 
matters hugely. If we could have resolved 
(et al) by now, none of this would be an issue.

I know you're on vacation this week, but wanted to very briefly follow up on the below — I'm going to ask 
to mail 
you the thumb drive referenced below, which has folders for five devices (NYCO24332, NYCO24369, NYCO24369_1, 
NYCO24372, and NYCO24384) on this coming Monday, so that you'll be around when it arrives (and in case you have to

sign for it). Per usual, if you could please take a look at it when you receive it, and then send on to PAE for processing and 
upload to Relativity, that would be great. Thank you!!

Following up on the below, thanks for those responses, that's very useful. In terms of the one outstanding item, in the 
thumb drive I received from 
yesterday with CART materials, NYC027913 is not included, so we are still missing that 
one. 
But I do see that each of the items with the "Included next round" label from the most recent spreadsheet (attached, with 
those items highlighted in red) are included, so that's helpful, thanks. 
In terms of any of the folders that have been produced so far, I know that you've sent supplemental materials on a 
handful of them (approximately seven total, I think) — do you currently expect to send any other supplemental materials 
for any of the devices we've received so far? Or are we fully complete? 
And then assuming those are all fully complete, or once they are, the only items pending will be the devices highlighted in 
gray in the attached, which we understand are being processed for hardware recovery. 
thanks,

Sony I didn't get back sooner. It's been kinda crazy. I'll answer your questions in order, so match them up. I'm 
going off what I can see on miae. 
The final items were given to 
She should have them. Reach out to her for delivery. 
The 3 folders you mention contain supplemental files, do.tore 
them. 
I am pretty sure NYCO27913 is included with the items 
has. If not, please let me know. 
As far as the old questions, you should have everything now. 
The zero byte files are just that. Sometimes the software will recover either file headers, or items off the 
directory listings, but no actual content. It lists them as zero length files. 
Need anything further, let me know.

I know you may still be traveling, but I wanted to check in on a handful of outstanding issues. If you're not available, 
perhaps 
can assist? 
1. 
On this past Sunday and Monday, you had said you had you had additional materials you planned to get to us on 
Monday. I don't believe we ever received anything additional this past week. Are those still pending, and if so, 
when can we get those materials? 
2. 
There were three folders that were included in the first disc you provided to us, but then also provided again on 
the most recent disc. Those folders are: NYC024328, NYC024366, and NYC024392. Can you please let us know 
why those were provided twice? In particular, we need to know whether any supplemental information is in the 
new folders with those NYC numbers, or whether we can ignore them on the recent disc because we already 
received them. 
3. 
One item is listed on your spreadsheet as having been provided on 7/23, but it was not on the most recent disc 
you sent. That item is: NYC027913 (row 40 in your spreadsheet). 
In case it's useful, I'm attaching a version of the spreadsheet you put on the disc, but with all the items we received 
folders for on the most recent hard drive highlighted in yellow. 
Separately, we're still waiting on answers to the questions from Thursday and Friday, July 23 and 24. To refresh, those 
questions are: 
4. 
Comparing your most recent spreadsheet to the prior one, and leaving aside the "Nothing for Southern" 
designations as well as the NYC numbers that look like they're for the desktops that held the actual drives we're 
looking at (such as NYC024385, 387, 389, 391, and 393, and NYC027909), I think there are just three additional 
devices listed here that weren't on the spreadsheet you previously sent. I have those as: NYC024328 (row 10), 
NYC024367 (row 62), and NYC027910 (row 96). Please confirm that these were added, and also that we're not 
missing any? I believe those were all provided on the first disc. 
5. 
As previously mentioned, the vendor has advised that in the initial seven devices provided, there were 
approximately 71,000 documents that are zero bytes (i.e., empty files). They are listed in the second attached 
spreadsheet. Is that accurate? Or does that reflect some issue with the extraction process? 
thanks,

I don't have the evidence in front of me, but it is probably accurate. It is not unusual for the software to find such 
files. I will review Monday to make sure. As to your questions from last night, the sheet should be 
comprehensive. I only recall 1 addition, but I am sure that what I have is reflected in the sheet. As for the items 
in dark grey, there are 2 servers with multiple drives. Some of those drives have physically failed. We have to get 
them to one of our HQ specialists for recovery. Since they are physically broken, data recovery may or may not 
be possible. It can be a very long process. We will get that moving ASAP. Need anything else, let me know.

This is very helpful, thank you. Comparing this to the prior spreadsheet, and leaving aside the "Nothing for Southern" 
designations as well as the NYC numbers that look like they're for the desktops that held the actual drives we're looking at 
(such as NYC024385, 387, 389, 391, and 393, and NYC027909), I think there are just three additional devices listed here

Could you please confirm that I have those additions correct, and that I'm not missing any? And it looks like all of those

I also see there are some drives that are still being processed, including NYC024376 through 380 and several drives in

Here is the up to date spreadsheet. I color coded things to hopefully make it easier. There are 5 items I have to 
get you (as we discussed this morning) Those should take another day or 2, so looking at Monday/Tuesday for that. Any

I'm not sure I can wait for a decision until Thursday. I will discuss with my colleagues and attempt to confer with the 
Government by phone tomorrow. Absent any additional information from the government you are not leaving me with 
any realistic options and I will probably need to simply advise Judge Nathan that the government's position is forthcoming 
but because we learned about the information on Friday and the Circuit's tight schedule we could not wait any longer. 
A phone call tomorrow would be appreciated.

Re: 
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
Dear Mr. Pagliuca: 
The Government writes in response to your letter dated August 9, 2020 requesting to use 
discovery materials produced by the Government in the above-referenced criminal case bearing 
Bates Nos. SDNY GM 00000834 through SDNY_ GM _ 00000962 (the "Unsealing Materials") to 
litigate a civil lawsuit. 
As an initial matter, the Government notes that it remains unclear whether you make this 
request in your capacity as defense counsel to Ms. Maxwell in the above-referenced criminal case, 
or in your capacity as her attorney in a separate civil matter. If the former, the Government 
maintains that the "Confidential" designation of the Unsealing Materials is appropriate because 
they pertain to an ongoing grand jury investigation and because Chief Judge Colleen McMahon 
and Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn have ordered that the Unsealing Materials remain under seal. 
The only exceptions to those sealing orders are the permission contained in Chief Judge 
McMahon's April 9, 2019 Order (Bates Nos. SDNY_GM_00000904 through SDNY_GM_ 
00000905), namely that the Order itself may be provided to Boies Schiller & Flexner LLP, and, 
pursuant to separate permissions the Government has obtained in connection with its discovery 
obligations, that the entirety of the Unsealing Materials may be provided to Ms. Maxwell as 
discovery in the above-referenced criminal case. Moreover, as noted above, the Unsealing 
Materials relate to an ongoing grand jury investigation, and their public disclosure at this stage 
risks interference with that investigation. Indeed, because those materials remain under seal, the 
Government has refrained, as it must, from publicly responding to your baseless accusations of 
malfeasance in the civil litigation—accusations you now know to be false. 
Moreover, the Protective Order issued by Judge Alison J. Nathan in the above-referenced 
criminal case expressly provides that any and all discovery material produced to the defendant by 
the Government, regardless of designation, "[s]hall be used by the Defendant or her Defense 
Counsel solely for purposes of the defense of this criminal action, and not for any civil proceeding 
or any purpose other than the defense of this action." (Protective Order, ECF No. 36, dated July 
EFTA00021902
--- PAGE 2 ---
Page 2 
30, 2020, q¶ 1(a), 10(a), 14(a) (emphasis added)). The Government notes that counsel for Ms. 
Maxwell consented to that limitation when negotiating the Protective Order in the criminal case. 
Accordingly, regardless of designation, the Protective Order expressly prohibits use of any 
discovery materials produced by the Government in the above-referenced criminal case in any 
civil case. 
To the extent you make this request in your capacity as counsel to Ms. Maxwell in civil 
litigation, the appropriate mechanism for obtaining these materials from the Government would 
be a request for records through the Freedom of Information Act or through a Toughy request, to 
the extent such materials are obtainable through either process, in the same manner as any other 
litigant seeking to use records from a federal criminal investigation in a civil case. If you wish to 
make such a request, the undersigned can refer you to the appropriate Assistant United States 
Attorney in our office's Civil Division, who will process your request. 
Very truly yours,

prosecutors and lawyers for witnesses in her sex trafficking case, and failing 
to convince a judge in a defamation suit to keep a trove of documents under

So I obviously had to do this pretty quickly today, and it doesn't help that Westlaw has been down all afternoon, but one 
way or the other we gotta get something filed. Does either of you have a moment to take a look at this in the next hour 
or so? 
I'm sorry, I know you have something at 2:001 If the answer is no, totally understand, I can just pass it up

Sorry guys, I'm having bad tech issues today. Attached is the draft letter re 23.1, which is far rougher than I'd hoped to get 
it. I should free back up in an hour or so, at which point I can turn back to this if there's still more to do on it.

Chris, 
Following up on our discussion last night, attached please find a revised draft protective order. As we discussed, although 
this does not represent a version that has been formally approved internally at our Office, it is an effort to include the 
updates and edits we talked through yesterday. I believe this should represent what we addressed, but I also realize that 
we've revised some aspects that you mentioned you'd need to further consider, and there is some new proposed 
language in areas you suggested we clarify, so I expect it may be useful to chat again once you've reviewed. All that said, 
we wanted to get you the revised version quickly, and I'm happy to discuss again, including anytime this weekend if that's 
helpful, to go through any outstanding issues. 
thanks,

Dear 
and 
Sony to contact you out of the blue, but I've been working on the Ghislaine Maxwell sex trafficking 
charges story for The Sunday Times newspaper in London over the past few weeks. 
The federal indictment highlights three specific victims, identified as Minor Victim 1, 2 and 3. 
EFTA00021931
--- PAGE 2 ---
I believe that "Minor Victim 3" is a British-born woman called 
and plan to state this 
in a news story on Sunday. She previously waived her right of anonymity at a court hearing attended by 
victims of Jeffrey Epstein in New York last August and subsequently appeared on the NBC Dateline show. 
Can you or one of your collea ues lease urgently let me know if there are any legal issues that would 
prevent me from naming Ms 
as a key witness in this case? 
Do prosecutors plan to publicly identify Ms Maxwell's victims at any point? If so, when? 
I can be contacted via email or on 
. My deadline is 10pm GMT today. 
Many thanks for your time and help.

'Laura 
Pursuant to the Court's Order of this afternoon, we write to schedule a telephonic meet and confer on issues relating to a 
protective order in the above-captioned case. Please let us know what time you are available today between 5:00 p.m. 
and 8:00 p.m., or tomorrow between 9:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m. In particular, it would be helpful to get the defendant's 
current position on the following: 
Whether you are aware of any case in any federal district in which a protective order was entered in a criminal 
case that prevented the Government from showing its own documents to prospective witnesses or their counsel 
without requiring restrictions upon those witnesses and their counsel; 
Whether you are able to describe any expected reason why it would be necessary or useful for the defendant to 
reference by name — rather than by pseudonym or other anonymized identifier — any victim in a public statement 
or publicly-docketed filing (and rather than by sealed filing, if such named identification is necessary), such that 
the Government may consider whether it can formulate language to address any such concerns, without 
conceding any right of the defendant to name any individual who has self-identified as a victim of Jeffrey Epstein 
or Ghislaine Maxwell at any time; and 
Whether the defense is willing to itself propose any language to address the Government's concerns in relation 
to the issue described immediately above, regarding the defendant's desire to be able to reference by name any 
victim in a public statement or publicly-docketed filing, without conceding that any such right exists. 
Additionally, also relating to the production of discovery, please mail, or otherwise have delivered, a 1 terabyte hard drive 
for purposes of the Government's discovery production. While we are in the process of determining the size of an initial 
production, and the size may total substantially less than 1 terabyte, that will ensure our ability to make a robust initial 
production and should be suitable for subsequent productions as well. That can be sent to my attention at our Office.

Re: 
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) 
Dear Counsel: 
Pursuant to Judge Nathan's Order of September 3, 2021 (Dkt. No. 335), the Government 
writes to inform you that it may refer at trial to the following individuals as co-conspirators of the 
defendant, including for the purpose of Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E): 
• 
Jeffre E stein 
The Government has produced all co-conspirator statements which it intends to offer at 
trial pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E) in the Government's production today or in its previous 
productions. To the extent the Government learns of additional co-conspirator statements as it 
continues to prepare for trial, it will produce those statements in connection with its ongoing 
obligation to produce Jencks Act material. 
EFTA00021942
--- PAGE 3 ---
Page 2 
Please be advised that the above list is limited to the individuals the Government may refer 
to as co-conspirators at trial. While the Government makes no representations as to whether it 
views other individuals as potential or actual co-conspirators of the defendant, it does not intend 
to refer to any other individuals as co-conspirators at trial. The above list is also not intended to 
reflect a complete list of individuals who may be referenced at trial. That information is contained 
in the Government's Jencks Act production(s). 
Please note that this letter and the information contained herein is governed by the July 31, 
2020 Protective Order in this case. This letter is itself designated as "confidential" under the 
Protective Order.

The Government has proffered a number of exhibits that it apparently intends to 
introduce at trial. It is difficult to assess the admissibility of some of the exhibits pretrial. Others, 
however, such as the ones described below, are not relevant in the context of this case, have no 
probative value, and are extremely prejudicial. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell objects to the 
following exhibits pursuant to Federal Rules of Evidence 401, 403 and 404(b): 
I. The Exhibits 
Government Exhibit 251 and 288 are framed photograph 
The photographs have no nexus to Ms. Maxwell 
The photographs have no probative value to any allegation in this 
case and appear to be offered to demonstrate some character flaw in Mr. Epstein and, by 
association, Ms. Maxwell. 
Government Exhibit 294 is a box containing an item described as "Twin Torpedos." This 
box was apparently seized during the execution of a search warrant at 358 El Brillo Way, Palm 
Beach, Florida, on October 20, 2005. These items are inadmissible for the reasons discussed in 
Ms. Maxwell's Motion to Exclude Items Purportedly Seized During Search of 358 El Brillo Way 
on October 20, 2005. In addition to problems related to the evidentiary foundation of these items, 
they are not relevant to any issue in this case. The unopened boxes were purportedly seized in 
2005, after the end of any conspiracy alleged here. No witness will identify these items as having 
been in Ms. Maxwell's possession or used in connection with any crime alleged in the 
indictment. 
EFTA00021947

Government Exhibit 313 purports to be a photograph of Ms. Maxwell, purportedly seized 
from a DVD disk in a binder found on a shelf in Jeffrey Epstein's house when it was searched in 
2012. There is no nexus between any allegation in this case and the photograph. 
Government Exhibit 606 is a document titled "Household Manual" which was apparently 
printed from an unidentified computer or other electronic storage device. There is no evidentiary 
foundation for this document, it is hearsay, and the one date on the document, "2/14/2005," 
suggests that it was created after the events alleged in the indictment. Ms. Maxwell did not create 
the document and no evidence exists suggesting that she did. 
II. The Items are Not Relevant 
Rule 401 defines relevant evidence as that which "has any tendency to make a fact more 
or less probable than it would be without the evidence," so long as "the fact is of consequence in 
determining the action." Fed. R. Evid. 401; see also Old Chief v. United States, 519 U.S. 172, 
178 (1997). 
There is no evidence that any accuser in this case saw, was aware of, or impacted by any 
of the above listed items. 
Regardless, the photographs are not probative of any material fact in this case. 
Similarly, the apparent seizure of the "Twin Torpedos" in 2005 is not probative of anything. 
Photographs of Ms. Maxwell found in a NY closet in 2019 prove no material fact in this 
case not otherwise established by less prejudicial evidence as discussed below. 
Finally, the unauthenticated 2005 "Household Manual" is outside the time frame alleged 
in the indictment and plays no role in any allegation contained in the indictment. 
III. The Evidence Should Be Excluded as Unfairly Prejudicial 
"The term `unfair prejudice,' as to a criminal defendant, speaks to the capacity of some 
concededly relevant evidence to lure the factfinder into declaring guilt on a ground different 
EFTA00021948
--- PAGE 6 ---
from proof specific to the offense charged." Old Chief v. United States, at 180. Federal Rule of 
Evidence 403 provides that "[a]lthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value 
is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, ... or by considerations of ... 
needless presentation of cumulative evidence." The Advisory Committee Notes to Rule 403 
define "undue prejudice" as an "undue tendency to suggest decision on an improper basis, 
commonly, though not necessarily, an emotional one." See United States v. Salim, 189 F. Supp. 
2d 93, 98 (S.D.N.Y. 2002). 
Here, any probative value of the items is substantially outweighed by the unfair prejudice 
to Ms. Maxwell and confusion of the issues. Introduction of Exhibits 251 and 288 will likely 
necessitate Defense production of evidence surrounding the photographs including testimony 
from 
There is no Government witness who claims that they ever saw or used the "Twin 
Torpedos" allegedly seized in 2005. To the extent the Government claims the items are relevant 
to establish that Epstein used sex toys, any probative value of this "fact" is outweighed by 
prejudice to Ms. Maxwell. 
The 2019 photograph of Ms. Maxwell have no role in any allegation here. To the extent 
that the Government claims that they intend to establish an intimate relationship between Ms. 
Maxwell and Mr. Epstein, that fact is provable by other photographs and testimony. 
The Manual contains multiple hearsay statements and reflects a lifestyle that many jurors 
may find offensive. Given the lack of foundation related to the anonymous, unsigned and 
unauthenticated document any marginal relevance is outweighed by issues of confusion, 
speculation and prejudice.

CONCLUSION 
For the above reasons Ms. Maxwell requests that the Court enter an order prohibiting the 
introduction of these proffered exhibits.

Re: 
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
Dear Counsel: 
Today the Government is producing additional materials, including Jencks Act and 
Giglio material, regarding witnesses who may be called to testify at trial in the above-referenced 
case. Enclosed please find an index detailing the materials included in today's production. 
The Government is also producing today certain materials relating to individuals the 
Government does not currently intend to call as witnesses at trial in the above-referenced case. 
These materials do not contain a comprehensive set of Jencks Act and Giglio materials, as the 
Government does not expect to call these individuals to testify at trial. Instead, these materials 
contain, among other things, certain witness statements. Enclosed please find an index detailing 
these materials. This production should not be taken to indicate that the Government believes it 
has any obligation to provide all of these materials; rather, we make this production as a courtesy. 
Moreover, although the Government presently does not intend to call the individuals listed in the 
enclosed index, we reserve the right to do so and will notify you should the Government determine 
that it intends to call any of these individuals at trial.

Please note that this letter, the enclosed indices, and the enclosed materials are 
governed by the July 31, 2020 Protective Order in this case. In particular, certain materials are 
designated as "confidential" under the Protective Order. The index is itself designated as 
"confidential," because it includes information regarding records designated as 
"confidential" under the Protective Order. The Department of Justice directed this office to 
cease the dissemination of materials marked with the word "confidential" in order to avoid 
potential confusion with markings reserved for classified documents. Accordingly, in order to 
note the appropriate designation of this production under the operative Protective Order in this 
case, the materials being produced today are marked with the following label: "SUBJECT TO 
PROTECTIVE ORDER PARAGRAPHS 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, and 17." This marking directly refers to 
the specific paragraphs of the Protective Order that govern today's production. 
Additionally, please note that many of the individuals referenced in this production are 
represented by counsel, as detailed in the enclosed indices. The Government reserves its right to 
amend and supplement these disclosures. 
Very truly yours, 
DAMIAN WILLIAMS 
United States Attorney

Chambers, 
Attached please find a letter in response to the Court's order yesterday regarding Minor Victim-3. The Government is not 
seeking redactions but is filing this letter temporarily under seal to permit the defense an opportunity to seek redactions, 
and pending the Court's resolution of the Government's other redaction requests.

Hi=, 
Thanks so much for all you're doing today, really appreciate it. Attached is a draft of the joint letter for today with the four 
categories. Could you please fill those in after you've had a chance to enter all the data from the defense? I'm fine with 
charts in each of the four questions (essentially just one row of cells with juror numbers). Also fine with bullet points. 
Whichever is easiest. 
Whenever you're at point when you have a sense of the timeline for this, that would be helpful to know — we'll need to 
send this to the defense with ample time to review for accuracy, so hoping to do that later this afternoon. 
Thanks!

Hey 
— the draft letter is attached, with all four categories filled in with the respective juror numbers. I'm also 
attaching the Excel sheet, containing defense and government objections, that contains all four lists in four different 
sheets. This Excel sheet is also saved on the shared in the jury selection folder. 
If anything needs to be edited, I'll be around for a bit longer today but I'm unavailable later this afternoon/evening, after 
3:30pm today. 
Cooper have kindly offered to handle any edits tonight when I'm offline, 
so I can loop them in if necessary. 
Thanks so much!

Thanks very much for speaking earlier today. As discussed, we are asking for the following three productions to be 
prepared for the Maxwell case. I've listed those tasks below in the order in which we discussed them, but, as we 
discussed, if you and the vendor believe a different order would be more efficient, please just let me know. 
EFTA00021983
--- PAGE 2 ---
As we've discussed, we need all of these materials to be delivered to 1St. Andrews by the end of October in order to 
meet our discovery deadline. 
Finally, I believ
hould be sending you a drive containing the scans of boxes of files from the USAO-SDFL. 
We need all of those files loaded into the US v Epstein database on Relativity in a new folder entitled "USAO-SDFL Files," 
ASAP so that we can review them, please. 
Thanks very much, as always for your help, and please do not hesitate to reach out if there are any questions or 
confusion. I'm always happy to chat. 
Thanks so much, 
EFTA00021984

Re: 
United States v. Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, No. 19 Cr. 830 
Dear Counsel: 
We write in response to your discovery request letters, dated January 29, 2020. This letter 
and the content herein is designated as "Protected Materials" pursuant to the Protective Order 
entered in this matter. 
Thomas Request. The Government refers to its prior response to this request, as stated at 
the November 25, 2019 pretrial conference. 
Noel Requests No. 1-10, 12-13. We note, at the outset, that many of these requests are 
extremely broad and pertain to information that does not appear to be relevant to the case. To the 
extent material called for by these requests is within the Government's possession and subject to 
disclosure at this time, the Government has already disclosed such information to you, including 
by letter dated January 24, 2020. To the extent these requests call for information that is not 
currently in the Government's possession or which is not subject to disclosure, you identify no 
legal basis or authority for these requests, and we are not aware of any authority requiring us to 
obtain and/or disclose this information. 
Noel Request No. 11. The name of the MCC technician referenced in the Government's 
previous letter is 
Noel Request No. 16. 
The Government has already produced the available video 
surveillance in its possession for July 23, 2019 for the Special Housing Unit. The Government 
attaches hereto two public filings in United States v. Tartaglione, 16 Cr. 832 (KMK), which 
reference these issues. 
06.20.2018 
EFTA00021988
--- PAGE 2 ---
Page 2 
Noel Requests No. 14-5, 17-23. These requests, in general terms, call for information about 
where particular evidence may be located within the discovery produced to date. As you note, you 
seek this information to "assist in expediting the ability of the defense to be ready for trial." 
Accordingly, with respect to Noel Requests No. 14-15, 17-23, at your request and solely as a 
courtesy to aid you in your review of discovery, the Government is providing the information that 
follows. The Government's response to your requests should not be used for any other purpose, 
nor should it be construed as a representation that only these files or portions of the surveillance 
video are potentially relevant to the Government's case or any potential defense, or as a 
representation that the identified portions are the only portions of surveillance video that would be 
responsive to your requests. The Government expressly reserves the right to identify and/or offer 
at trial additional material as probative of any of the issues identified in these requests. 
Noel Request No. 14. With respect to August 9, 2019, we direct your attention to the 
following 
video 
files: 
CH0080_20190809195956; 
CH0080_20190809205956, 
CH0080_20190809215956; CH0080_20190809225956. With respect to August 10, 2019, the 
following 
video 
files 
contain 
this 
activity: 
CH0080_20190809235959; 
CH0080_20190810005959; 
CH0080_20190810025959; 
CH0080_20190810035959; 
CH0080_20190810045959; and CH0080_20190810055959. 
Noel Request No. 15.  While the Government has not conducted a review of every time 
Jeffrey Epstein was captured on MCC surveillance during the more than 30 days he was housed 
there prior to his death and does not purport to provide such an exhaustive response, as a courtesy 
and to aid in your review of the discovery, we direct your attention to the following: on August 9, 
2019 Epstein was captured leaving his cell to make a phone call at approximately 18:53:54 -
18:54:46 (CH0080_20190809175956). Epstein was escorted back to his cell at approximately 
19:49:25 — 19:49:39 (CH0080_20190809185956). 
Noel Request No. 17. We direct your attention to files CH0080_20190809145956 and 
CH0080_20190809155956, during approximately 15:45:00 — 16:15:00 on August 9, 2019. 
Noel Request No. 18. We direct your attention to files CH0080_20190809205956 and 
CH0080_20190809215956, during approximately 19:45:00 — 20:15:00 on August 9, 2019. 
Noel Request No. 19. We direct your attention to file CH0080_20190809215956, during 
approximately 22:29:00 — 22:34:00. 
Noel Request No. 20. We direct your attention to files CH0080_20190809225956 
CH0080_20190809235959, during approximately 23:45:00 (August 9) - 00:15:00 (August 10). 
Noel Request No. 21. The Government does not presently believe this interaction was 
captured by surveillance video. 
Noel Request No. 22. The Government refers you to the forensic examination of the 
computers used by defendants Noel and Thomas during August 9 to 10, 2019, which were 
previously produced in discovery (SDNY_00000021 — SDNY_00000075). The Government also 
06.20.2018 
EFTA00021989

06:20:00 as to defendant Noel, and approximately (8/10) 00:35:00 - 01:15:00 and (8/10) 06:00:00 
— 06:20:00 as to defendant Thomas. 
Noel Request No. 23.  The Government refers you to files CH008020190810005959, 
CH0080 20190810015959, and CH0080 20190810025959 during approximately 00:01:00 — 
03:15:00 on August 10, 2019.

My supervisors gave me your name as the point of contact at the FBI to help coordinate the review of images and videos 
from Jeffrey Epstein's devices for discovery in the Ghislaine Maxwell case. Thank you so much for being willing to help 
out with this while 
and 
are traveling. 
I've spoken with 
about some of the logistics, and it would be great if you and I could have a call to talk 
about next steps. Is there a time this afternoon when you would be free for a call? 
Thanks,

Thanks for sending. For this account, could you please send us the account statements surrounding the 10/19/99 transfer 
to Maxwell that we discussed? It would be helpful to understand what the source is of the funds for the transfer. In 
addition, could you please let me know the bates range for the account documents for this account? I'm having difficulty

Attached are the account documents for the Financial Trust Company. In the production, I did not see a signature card for 
these accounts. However, there is a J.P. Morgan Entity Resolution form which schedules authorized signers (bates U 1934).

Hi all, 
The Times consented to the one-week request. I think it is likely the Court will approve it. I plan to file the attached letter,

concerns. I'll let you know as soon as the Court rules.

We understand you had been planning to make the Noel/Thomas FOIA disclosure on Friday. We just ran this by =, 
and she'd like you to ask for a brief (1-2 week) extension to enable us to confer internally regarding the interviews, which

Hi, 
Two things: 
1. The guards that Noel named as not doing rounds/counts and pre-filling were COs 
2. According to the notes of his interview with us, 
said he knew but did not tell anyone thatMwas 
released or Epstein was without a cellmate. He also stated that he was waiting for the c 
• 
warden to put 
a
w
someone new in the cell. In a recent interview with OIG, he says that he didn't know ths 
as gone and 
denies his prior statement. Do you have a recollection of this interview? If so, 
ants to know if we think the 
notes/MOI are correct.

Hi, 
Two things: 
1. The guards that Noel named as not doing rounds/counts and pre-filling were COs 
2. According to the notes of his interview with us, 
said he knew but did not tell anyone that 
was 
released or Epstein was without a cellmate. He also stated that he was waiting for the captain or warden to put 
someone new in the cell. In a recent interview with OIG, he says that he didn't know tha 
was gone and 
denies his prior statement. Do you have a recollection of this interview? If so, Lyeson wants to know if we think the 
notes/MOI are correct.

Re: 
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 20 Cr. 330 (MN) 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
The Government respectfully submits this letter in connection with the Court's Order of 
March 24, 2021, regarding the defendant's application for an order authorizing a subpoena 
pursuant to Rule 17(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure for records from Boies Schiller 
Flexner LLP ("BSF"). For the reasons set forth herein, the Government respectfully requests that 
the Court (1) direct the defendant to provide the Government with a copy of the proposed subpoena 
to BSF and notice of all existing and future applications for subpoenas under Rule 17(c) returnable 
in advance of trial, and (2) direct that any productions made in response to Rule 17(c) subpoenas 
be produced to the opposing party and marked confidential under the protective order. 
Background
I. 
As the Court is aware, the Government has produced to the defendant more than 2.7 million 
pages of discovery pursuant to the Government's various discovery obligations, including Rule 
16. The parties are also in discussions about the timing of further productions by the Government, 
including material provided pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3500 and Giglio material. 
EFTA00022027
--- PAGE 2 ---
Page 2 
Those obligations, and not Rule 17 subpoenas, provide the avenue through which 
defendants in criminal cases obtain discovery. As the Supreme Court has explained, "[i]t was not 
intended by Rule 16 to give a limited right of discovery, and then by Rule 17 to give a right of 
discovery in the broadest terms." Bowman Dairy Co. v. United States, 341 U.S. 214, 220 (1951); 
see also United States v. Purin, 486 F.2d 1363, 1368 (2d Cir. 1973) ("A subpoena duces tecum in 
a criminal case is not intended as a means of discovery."). Unlike the rules of civil procedure—
permitting the issuance of subpoenas to seek production of documents or materials which, although 
themselves not admissible, may lead to admissible evidence—the criminal rules do not authorize 
the issuance of such broad pretrial subpoenas under Rule 17. See United States v. Cherry, 876 F. 
Supp. 547, 552 (S.D.N.Y. 1995); United States v. Gross, 24 F.R.D. 138, 141 (S.D.N.Y. 1959) 
(Rule 17(c) cannot be used "to obtain leads as to the existence of additional documentary evidence 
or to seek information relating to the defendant's case. This type of discovery, permissible under 
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, has not been authorized for criminal trials."). 
The purpose of Rule 17(c) is to "expedite the trial by providing a time and place before 
trial for the inspection of specific materials that the parties intend to offer into evidence. See 
United States v. Tagliaferro, No. 19 Cr. 472 (PAC), 2021 WL 980004, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 16, 
2021) (citing Bowman Dab), Co., 341 U.S. at 220 (1951)); see also United States v. Ulbricht, 858 
F.3d 71, 109 (2d Cir. 2017) (explaining that the rule "allows parties to subpoena documents and 
objects to be introduced at criminal trials"), abrogated on other grounds as recognized by United 
States v. Chambers, 751 F. App'x 44, 46 & n.1 (2d Cir. 2018) (summary order). 
Accordingly, 
the Supreme Court has explained that, to require production of materials pursuant to Rule 17(c), 
the party seeking production must show that: 
(1) that the documents are evidentiary and relevant; (2) that they are 
not otherwise procurable reasonably in advance of trial by exercise 
EFTA00022028
--- PAGE 3 ---
Page 3 
of due diligence; (3) that the party cannot properly prepare for trial 
without such production and inspection in advance of trial and that 
the failure to obtain such inspection may tend unreasonably to delay 
the trial; and (4) that the application is made in good faith and is not 
intended as a general "fishing expedition." 
United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 699-700 (1974) (footnote omitted); see United States v. 
Skelos, 988 F.3d 645, 661 (2d Cir. 2021) (affirming a decision to quash subpoenas through 
application of Nixon); United States v. Pena, No. 15 Cr. 551 (AJN), 2016 WL 8735699, at *1-*2 
(S.D.N.Y. Feb. 12, 2016) (applying Nixon, rather than the "more liberal standard" of United States 
v. Tucker, 249 F.R.D. 58 (S.D.N.Y. 2008), to the propriety of a Rule 17(c) subpoena). 
The Nixon test is demanding. The defendant must establish that the defense's "application 
is made in good faith and is not intended as a general `fishing expedition.' Nixon, 418 U.S. at 
700; United States v. Yian, No. 94 Cr. 719 (DLC), 1995 WL 614563, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 19, 
1995) (quashing subpoena that "call[s] for the production of the entire investigative file and is 
accurately described as a fishing expedition"); United States v. Cuthbertson, 630 F.2d 139, 144 
(3d Cir. 1980) ("[T]est for enforcement is whether the subpoena constitutes a good faith effort to 
obtain ident
ed evidence rather than a general `fishing expedition' that attempts to use the rule as 
a discovery device." (emphasis added)). Indeed, because the Rule poses such a risk of abuse and 
misuse, courts are stringent in holding those seeking to obtain documents to Rule 17(c) to their 
burden of demonstrating that the documents sought are (1) relevant, (2) admissible, (3) specifically 
identified, and (4) not otherwise procurable, and it is "insufficient" for a party to show only that 
the subpoenaed documents "are potentially relevant or may be admissible," United States v. RW 
Prof! Leasing Servs. Corp., 228 F.R.D. 158, 162 (E.D.N.Y 2005) (emphasis added). "[A] mere 
hope that the documents, if produced, may contain evidence favorable to the defendant's case will 
not suffice. Rule 17(c) requires a showing that the materials sought are currently admissible in 
EFTA00022029

evidence; it cannot be used as a device to gain understanding or explanation." United States v. 
Rich, No. 83 Cr. 579 (SWK), 1984 WL 845, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 7, 1984) (internal quotation 
marks omitted) (emphasis added). Accordingly, subpoenas that call for "any" and "all" records 
"do not evince specificity" and "read[] like a discovery request, which is not permitted under Rule 
17(c)." Tagliaferro, 2021 WL 980004 at *3; see Pena, 2016 WL 8735699, at *3. And "[g]enerally 
the need for evidence to impeach witnesses is insufficient to require its production in advance of 
trial." Nixon, 418 U.S. at 701 (citations omitted); see Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(h) ("No party may 
subpoena a statement of a witness or of a prospective witness under this rule."). 
If a subpoena calls for "personal or confidential information about a victim," the subpoena 
may be served "only by court order" following "notice to the victim so that the victim can move 
to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object." Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(3). After a subpoena 
issues, "[t]he court may direct the witness to produce the designated items in court before trial or 
before they are to be offered in evidence." Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(1). "When the items arrive, the 
court may permit the parties and their attorneys to inspect all or part of them." Id. 
II. 
The Court Should Direct the Defendant to Provide Notice of Prior and Future 
Applications Under Rule 17(c) to the Government 
The Government has legitimate and cognizable interests in Rule 17(c) subpoenas issued by 
the defense. In particular, courts have routinely found that the Government has standing to move 
to quash Rule 17(c) subpoenas that target information about anticipated Government witnesses 
"based on the Government's 'interest in preventing any undue lengthening of the trial, any undue 
harassment of the witness and his family, and any prejudicial over-emphasis on the witness's 
credibility."' United States v. Ray, -- F.R.D. --, No. 20 Cr. 110 (LJL), 2020 WL 6939677, at *7 
(S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2020) (alterations omitted) (quoting United States v. Giampa, No. 92 Cr. 437 
(PKL), 1992 WL 296440, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 7, 1992)); see United States v. Bergstein, No. 16 
EFTA00022030
--- PAGE 5 ---
Page 5 
Cr. 746 (PKC), 2017 WL 6887596, at *2-*3 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 28, 2017) ("Preventing the undue 
harassment of a cooperating witness is a legitimate governmental interest giving rise to standing 
in this context."); cf. United States v. Nachamie, 91 F. Supp. 2d 552, 558-60 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) 
(concluding that the Government failed to establish a legitimate interest where, among other 
things, none of the subpoenaed entities had been "publicly identified by the Government as trial 
witnesses, or as particularly vulnerable witnesses"). That is particularly true where the subpoena 
at issue seeks material that the defendants would be entitled to, if at all, as Giglio or 3500 material 
given that the Government has a cognizable interest in "controlling the timing of disclosures as 
to" witnesses who are expected to testify at trial, and for whom the Government has various 
disclosure obligations. United States v. Cole, No. 19 Cr. 869 (ER), 2021 WL 912425, at *2 
(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 10, 2021); see Bergstein, 2017 WL 6887596, at *3. Finally, the Government has 
standing to challenge subpoenas that call for its own communications. See United States v. Carton, 
Cr. 680 (CM), 2018 WL 5818107, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 19, 2018) (quashing a subpoena for 
communications with the Government).' 
The only way for the Government to vindicate those interests is with notice so that the 
Government may, as appropriate, have an opportunity to quash the subpoenas. There is no avenue, 
after a subpoena is issued and fulfilled, for the Government to protect its interests in the timing of 
disclosures about victims or the disclosure of the Government's own communications. That is 
particularly important given that a subpoena recipient may lack sufficient knowledge about the 
' The Government also has standing to challenge a Rule 17(c) subpoena at the request of a victim, 
witness or third-party impacted by the subpoena. See Ray, 2020 WL 6939677, at *7 ("Courts have 
acknowledged that the Government has standing to challenge Rule 17(c) subpoenas directed to a 
non-party when the non-party authorizes the Government to assert his or her right by request or by 
indicating its joinder in a motion to quash." (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted)).

case or motivation to move to quash an otherwise improper subpoena. 2 Accordingly, the 
Government respectfully requests notice of all subpoenas with pretrial return dates issued or sought 
to be issued under Rule 17(c).3
While, as the Court noted in its Order, Rule 17(c) subpoenas are frequently issued ex parte 
in this district, the issue is rarely litigated. See, e.g., United States v. States v. Wey, 252 F. Supp. 3d 
237, 243 (S.D.N.Y. 2017) (noting, without extended discussion, that subpoena had issued upon ex 
parte application); United States v. Earls, No. 03 Cr.0364 (NRB), 2004 WL 350725, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. 
Feb. 25, 2004) (noting that the defendant may seek subpoenas ex parte). When courts have considered 
the issue, however, many have directed that the parties should give each other notice of Rule 17(c) 
subpoenas unless a party can justify proceeding ex parte. See United States v. Skelos, No. 15 Cr. 
317 (KMW), 2018 WL 2254538, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. May 17, 2018) (explaining that courts have 
permitted ex parte requests "where a reason existed for doing so," and requiring notice "[t]o further 
reduce the risk that trial will be delayed, unless a party has a compelling reason for proceeding ex 
parte with a subpoena request"), aff'd, 988 F.3d 645 (2d Cir. 2021); United States v. St. Lawrence, 
Cr. 259 (CS), Dkt. No. 66 at 6 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 22, 2016) (requiring motions for Rule 17(c) 
subpoenas and permitting ex parte applications "if the movant can articulate a reason why it should 
be"); United States v. Boyle, No. 08 Cr. 523 (CM), 2009 WL 484436, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 24, 
2009) (requiring noticed motions for Rule 17(c) subpoenas to "assur[e] that such subpoenas are 
not abused or used for impermissible discovery," and permitting ex parte applications "where a 
For example, a financial institution may lack sufficient knowledge about the case or motivation 
to expend the resources to move to quash what appears to be a routine subpoena that broadly seeks 
financial records for a Government cooperator or lay witness to be used for impeachment purposes, 
notwithstanding the fact that such a subpoena may run afoul of the Nixon standard. 
The Government is not seeking notice of subpoenas returnable at trial. 
EFTA00022032

Page 7 
party can demonstrate" a basis (emphasis omitted)); United States v. Weisman, 01 Cr. 529 (BSJ), 
2002 WL 1467845, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. July 8, 2002) (similar); see also United States v. Fox, 275 F. 
Supp. 2d 1006, 1012 & n.7 (D. Neb. 2003) (surveying the caselaw and adopting the "majority 
view" that Rule 17(c) "does not ordinarily permit the use of ex parte applications by the 
government or the defense for subpoenas seeking pretrial production of documents unless the sole 
purpose of seeking the documents is for use at trial," and even then, only if "there is a good trial-
related reason" and generally requiring production in the presence of the opposing party); 2 Wright 
& Miller, Fed. Prac. & Procedure § 275 (46' ed.) ("It has been held, however, that in limited 
circumstances, both the government and a defendant may make an ex parte application for a pre-
trial subpoena duces tecum" (emphasis added)). But see Ray, 2020 WL 6939677 at *8 ("Courts 
in this District have long followed the practice of permitting both the defense and the Government 
to submit ex parte applications for Rule 17(c) subpoenas."); United States v. Reyes, 162 F.R.D. 
468, 470 (S.D.N.Y. 1995) (permitting ex parte applications because a party must "detail its trial 
strategy or witness list in order to convince a court that the subpoena satisfies the Nixon 
standards"). Notice of Rule 17(c) subpoenas is similarly appropriate in this case to prevent abuse 
and address objections expediently. And such a requirement is consistent with the plain language 
of Rule 17: while Rule 17(b) expressly provides for an ex parte procedure for indigent defendants 
seeking to subpoena a witness for trial, it makes no such provision for an application for the 
production of documents and objects pursuant to Rule 17(c).4
In Ray, the Court concluded that Rule 17(c) is simply an extension of Rules 17(a) and (b)'s 
provisions of subpoenas to witnesses, which may issue without notice. See 2020 WL 6939677, at 
*8 (quoting United States v. Fiorack, 838 F. Supp. 77, 79 (W.D.N.Y. 1993)). However, Rule 17(c) 
subpoenas for records are quite unlike subpoenas for trial testimony: they can be made returnable 
before trial, and Rule 17(c)'s text provides that materials obtained pursuant to such a subpoena 
may be returnable to the Court, which may in turn "permit the parties and their attorneys to inspect 
all or part of them," and subjects the subpoenas to motions to quash. Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(1)-(2) 
EFTA00022033
--- PAGE 8 ---
Page 8 
Moreover, as the information currently available to the Government about the BSF 
subpoena makes plain, the Government's concerns are well founded. Indeed, the defendant has 
already sought issuance of a subpoena that appears to directly implicate the Government's interests 
by expressly and improperly seeking broad categories of victim information and communications 
with the Government. While the Government has not seen the subpoena to BSF, it also appears 
that the subpoena constitutes a fishing expedition for potential impeachment material, which 
plainly runs afoul of the Nixon test. (Letter from BSF to the Court at 2, Dkt. No. 191).5 Insofar 
as the defendant is attempting to engage in such an improper expedition in this case—or even if 
the defendant is merely pushing the limits of a Rule 17 subpoena—the Government respectfully 
submits that it should be afforded the opportunity to bring its concerns to the Court's attention. 
The Government recognizes that some information, such as portions of a defendant's 
explanation for why a particular request in a particular subpoena meets the Nixon standard, may 
reveal critical defense strategy meriting ex parte consideration by the Court. But the Government 
respectfully submits that interest can be served through specific defense requests tailored to the 
particular redaction or application at issue, rather than a default whereby the defendant is permitted 
to proceed entirely ex parte in seeking documents and materials pursuant to Rule 17(c). 
(emphasis added); see United States v. Reyes, 162 F.R.D. 468, 470 (S.D.N.Y. 1995) ("Rules 17(a) 
and 17(b), which govern the issuance of subpoenas returnable at trial, also do not provide guidance 
as to the proper procedure for obtaining a pretrial subpoena duces tecum."). These procedures are, 
at a bare minimum, in tension with proceeding ex parte or under the rules that govern subpoenas 
for trial testimony. 
The Government has also not seen any response filing by the defendant, which per the Court's 
March 24, 2021 Order was to be filed on or before April 2, 2021. To the extent the defendant did 
file such a response, it was neither docketed nor provided to the Government, and as such, the 
Government is unable to address herein any arguments made by the defendant about the BSF 
subpoena. 
EFTA00022034

III. 
Any Records Obtained Pursuant to a Rule 17(c) Subpoena Should Be Marked 
Confidential Under the Protective Order and Produced to the Opposing Party 
Additionally, and to the extent the defendant has issued or will issue other subpoenas a 
pane pursuant to Rule 17(c), the responsive records should be produced to the Government and 
marked confidential pursuant to the protective order. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(1). 
First, materials gathered pursuant to a Rule 17(c) subpoena by either party should be 
promptly made available to their adversary. As noted above, the text of Rule 17(c) plainly provides 
that materials obtained pursuant to a subpoena may be returned to the Court which "may permit 
the parties and their attorneys to inspect all or part of them." Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(1). Nowhere 
does the Rule provide for one party's ability to use a subpoena to secretively gather material in 
advance of trial, nor does it include a categorical exception due to concerns about defense or trial 
strategy. Indeed, because the purpose of Rule 17 is to obtain evidence for use at trial, and not to 
investigate for evidence or obtain impeachment material, disclosure of the fruits of a Rule 17(c) 
subpoena fits neatly with Rule 16's reciprocal obligations for disclosure of evidence that the 
defendant intends to introduce in her case-in-chief. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(bX1)(A); United States 
v. St. Lawrence, 16 Cr. 259 (CS), Dkt. No. 66 at 6 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 22, 2016) ("It seems to the Court 
that because Rule 17(c) subpoenas are intended to obtain specific materials that the party expects 
to offer into evidence, Rule 16 would oblige the party to make the materials available to the other 
side anyway.").6
By contrast, to the extent the defendant has improperly obtained information through a 
Rule 17(c) subpoena, the Government should have the opportunity to move to preclude its use at 
trial. In order to permit such a motion to be made in a timely manner—and so as to avoid the 
To the extent the Government makes use of Rule 17(c) subpoenas, it similarly will promptly 
produce all material received to the defendant. 
EFTA00022035

Page 10 
unnecessary delay and disruption that will occur if the Government only learns of the existence of 
such material during trial—the Government seeks disclosure of any records obtained in response 
to such a subpoena. At a minimum, the Court should order production of subpoena returns directly 
to the Court, so it may screen out irrelevant or improper information and determine whether any 
materials should be made available to the Government as well as the defendant. 
Second, the Court should direct that any material obtained pursuant to a Rule 17 subpoena 
be marked confidential and subject to the protective order. As noted above, the BSF subpoena 
appears to call for a substantial amount of sensitive personal information about victims. For 
instance, according to the letter from BSF, the subpoena to BSF requests the "original, complete 
copy" of a victim's diary. (Letter from BSF to the Court at 5, Dkt. No. 191). To the extent the 
defendant has obtained or will obtain sensitive information about victims or witnesses, it should 
be treated as "confidential" under the protective order much like other such information in this 
case. 
EFTA00022036

IV. 
Conclusion 
The Government respectfully requests that the Court order the defendant to provide notice 
to the Government of pending and future applications for Rule 17(c) subpoenas returnable in 
advance of trial, and for the Court to order that any records obtained in response to Rule 17(c) 
subpoenas be treated as confidential under the protective order and disclosed to the Government.

Thanks for sending. For this account, could you please send us the account statements surrounding the 10/19/99 transfer 
to Maxwell that we discussed? It would be helpful to understand what the source is of the funds for the transfer. In 
addition, could you please let me know the bates range for the account documents for this account? I'm having difficulty 
locating them in the production. If you're able to flag any other KYC documents in the file, that would be extremely 
helpful.

Attached are the account documents for the Financial Trust Company. In the production, I did not see a signature card for 
these accounts. However, there is a J.P. Morgan Entity Resolution form which schedules authorized signers (bates ii 1934). 
If you have any questions, please contact me.

Hi Mark, 
When you have a moment, could you please send me the signature card for the JP Morgan account ending in 5001? It's 
the Financial Trust Co. account. I wasn't able to easily locate it in the production, so wanted to check with you. 
Thanks!

The VOC chiefs mentioned that you litigated before Judge Nathan whether you had to disclose the names of the 
victims/witnesses identified in your indictment by number. Can you send us your briefing on that and any written order

Thanks very much for speaking earlier today. As discussed, we are asking for the following three productions to be 
prepared for the Maxwell case. I've listed those tasks below in the order in which we discussed them, but, as we 
discussed, if you and the vendor believe a different order would be more efficient, please just let me know. 
EFTA00022048
--- PAGE 3 ---
As we've discussed, we need all of these materials to be delivered to 1St. Andrews by the end of October in order to 
meet our discovery deadline. 
Finally, I believe 
should be sending you a drive containing the scans of boxes of files from the USAO-SDFL. 
We need all of those files loaded into the US v Epstein database on Relativity in a new folder entitled "USAO-SDFL Files," 
ASAP so that we can review them, please. 
Thanks very much, as always for your help, and please do not hesitate to reach out if there are any questions or 
confusion. I'm always happy to chat. 
Thanks so much,

Subject: MLA Request: Material Witness PA 182-73090 
The MLA request was forwarded this morning to the UK Central Authority at the Home Office. Each person to 
whom it was sent is noted on the cover letter. I also swapped emails with Philomena Creffield (she is head of the 
MLA unit at the UKCA) this morning regarding our request to keep a written record of each person who sees 
the MLA request. 
Their initial reaction was one of surprise regarding its timing. The pandemic in London is expected to peak in 
the next week or two and the UKCA is operating at emergency staffing levels. We talked it through, and I 
explained that while this is an important case, we understood that everyone is operating at reduced capacity, and 
we would adjust our expectations regarding response time accordingly. I also noted that we have been regularly 
forwarding new MLA requests to the UK throughout this period (just not requests with such high-profile 
subjects). I also pointed out that while the timing is very unfortunate, it did not have to be this way. I explained 
that the case team had been trying to contact the witness's representatives to obtain a voluntary interview for 
months without any success. 
Here is some general information about the MLA process: 
The cover letter and mutual legal assistance request were sent to the UK Central Authority (UKCA) on April 7, 2020, via 
email. Lawyers at the UKCA will conduct an initial review of the request for compliance with the MLA Treaty, and then 
assign it out to one or more law enforcement agencies to gather the requested evidence. The UKCA review can take 
anywhere from 7-30 days. In complex cases, it can take longer. We will provide notice to you when the request is 
assigned to a law enforcement agency for execution. (Our operating assumption is that it will be assigned to the London 
Metropolitan Police to execute -- and likely to the same unit which responded to 
initial complaint.) 
It usually takes several months for the UK law enforcement agency to assess the request, obtain the legal process, gather 
the evidence, provide that evidence to the UKCA, which will in turn provide the evidence to our office. In this case, the 
law enforcement agency will make another assessment of the legal basis for the request and determine whether legal 
EFTA00022059
--- PAGE 2 ---
process (such as a judicial order) is necessary to execute the request. If the witness agrees to an interview and agrees to 
turn over documents, then legal process will not be required. If he declines, then they will need to obtain legal process. 
A decision by the UKCA to approve an MLA request, and a decision by the law enforcement agency to execute the MLA 
request can be challenged in a process called "Judicial Review" or "JR". If a witness seeks to resist the production of 
evidence or an interview, the first reaction is typically delay. The second reaction is to file a JR action. If that happens, I 
can walk you through that lengthy process. 
Our practice is to let the UK execution process run for 90 days before making a status inquiry. After that, we will typically 
inquire every 30 days unless the UKCA has informed us that it is a particularly difficult matter and inquiring every 30 days 
would be fruitless. This is a unique case, so we will likely inquire at least monthly going forward. 
In the event that we receive partial results from the UKCA (such as in cases where multiple law enforcement agencies 
have been assigned to execute your request), we will typically provide those partial results to you shortly after we receive 
them from the UKCA. 
A few requests: 
Critical Evidence: If a limited portion of your request is critical to your case and a prompt response would substantially 
assist your case preparation, please let us know. Please identify the specific requested evidence and the date by which it 
would particularly assist. We assume that everything you ask for is important, so there is no need to reiterate that. 
Trial Dates: If you have a trial or other specific deadline, please let us know so we can inform the UKCA and track your 
matter with an eye to that deadline. 
Filing MLA Requests: Please do not file with a court a copy of the attached completed MLA request. This has backfired 
in a number of cases in the past and poses substantial risks. (Please call if you are considering such a filing.) By contrast, 
if you file a motion pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §3292 you may file the cover letter transmitting the request (but not the request 
itself). 
Withdrawal of your request: Should you no longer need the evidence requested, such as in the event of a plea, please 
notify our office as soon as possible so that we may withdraw the request and close our file.

FROM: 
The Central Authority of the United States 
TO: 
The Central Authority of the United Kingdom 
SUBJECT: 
Request for Assistance in the Matter of Material Witness PA 
DATE: 
April 3, 2020 
The Central Authority of the United States of America ("U.S.") requests the assistance of 
the Central Authority of the United Kingdom ("UK") under the 1994 Treaty of Mutual Legal 
Assistance in Criminal Matters between the U.S. and the UK, as amended by the 16 December 
2004 Instrument and exchange of notes ("the Treaty"). The United States Attorney for the 
Southern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (collectively the "U.S. 
authorities") seek to interview H.R.H. Prince Andrew Albert Christian Edward, the Duke of York, 
also known as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor ("Prince Andrew" or"the witness"), relating to two 
ongoing criminal investigations. 
In addition, U.S. authorities seek records of certain 
communications and meetings between Prince Andrew and the subjects of one investigation. 
With regard to the interview, U.S. authorities request to conduct a voluntary interview of 
Prince Andrew and request the assistance of UK authorities in arranging for such an interview. In 
the event that the witness declines to participate in a voluntary interview, U.S. authorities request 
that UK authorities conduct a compelled interview of the witness under oath. 
EFTA00022062
--- PAGE 2 ---
The U.S. authorities may use the requested records and information in the U.S. criminal 
investigation and proceedings, as defined at Article 19 of the Treaty, and in other U.S. criminal 
investigations and proceedings, as well as non-criminal judicial or administrative proceedings 
directly related to the U.S. criminal investigations and proceedings, pursuant to Article 7 of the 
Treaty. 
CONFIDENTIALITY 
The U.S. authorities are conducting ongoing criminal investigations. Notwithstanding 
that one or more of the persons referenced in this request is aware to some extent of the U.S. 
authorities' attention to this matter, this request also recounts specifics and evidentiary detail that 
may not be known, exposure of which could impede the investigation with regard to the integrity 
of evidence and witness accounts. Because the persons referenced in this request are generally 
aware of the U.S. authorities' investigations, U.S. authorities are not requesting that the existence 
of this legal assistance request be kept confidential. However, premature notification of the 
specific subject matter and the questions outlined in the attachments to this request could seriously 
jeopardize the investigations or compromise any trial, by prompting a witness to alter or prepare 
his/her answers to specific questions, by prompting others to destroy or tamper with evidence; 
change patterns of behavior; intimidate potential witnesses; or alert others who could do the same. 
Accordingly, and pursuant to articles 4(3)(j) and 7 of the Treaty, please keep the contents of this 
request, including the subject matter of questioning and the questions themselves, confidential and 
please ensure that they are not shared with any persons (including the witness, the witness's 
representatives, or subjects of the investigation), or with any government officials whose 
knowledge is not absolutely necessary for purposes of executing this request. In addition, please 
advise all who must be made aware of this request that the contents are to be kept confidential and 
EFTA00022063
--- PAGE 3 ---
should not be shared with any witness, potential subjects of the investigation or any other persons. 
If this request cannot be executed without breaching such confidentiality, please notify U.S. 
authorities through the U.S. Department of Justice, Office of International Affairs prior to taking 
any action. U.S. authorities also request that UK authorities keep a written log of all those 
individuals who have been made aware of the contents of this request, noting when those 
individuals were so made aware. 
THE FACTS 
Investigation I: The Jeffrey Epstein Investigation 
U.S. citizen Jeffrey Epstein is alleged to have engaged in the sexual abuse of minor girls 
during the period of approximately 1994 through 2005. On or about July 2, 2019, a grand jury in 
the Southern District of New York returned an Indictment charging Epstein with violations of 
U.S. criminal laws in connection with his sexual abuse of minors, including with engaging in a 
conspiracy to sexually traffic in minors. Epstein was arrested pursuant to the Indictment on or 
about July 6, 2019, and had been detained pending trial in New York. On or about August 10, 
2019, Epstein committed suicide in his cell. Notwithstanding Epstein's death, the investigation 
that led to his indictment remains ongoing. That ongoing investigation has revealed evidence of 
additional criminal conduct by Epstein's associates, including Ghislaine Maxwell. 
The investigation to date has revealed that Prince Andrew may have been a witness to 
and/or participant in certain events of relevance to the ongoing investigation. For example, one 
victim has alleged that Maxwell introduced her to Prince Andrew who, according to this victim, 
was present for certain of the victim's interactions with Epstein and Maxwell. Additionally, 
documentary evidence uncovered during the course of this investigation has revealed 
information suggesting that Prince Andrew had knowledge that Maxwell recruited females to 
EFTA00022064
--- PAGE 4 ---
engage in sex acts with Epstein and other men. Finally, there is evidence that Prince Andrew 
engaged in sexual conduct involving one of Epstein's victims. Prince Andrew is not presently a 
target of the investigation, and U.S. authorities have not, to date, gathered evidence that he has 
committed any crime under U.S. law. 
Investigation Ili The Peter Nygard Investigation 
The U.S. authorities are investigating Peter Nygard, a Canadian citizen, and other co-
conspirators' involvement in an international sex trafficking ring victimizing adult women and 
minor girls. The investigation concerns, among other things, allegations of sex trafficking at 
various locations inside and outside the United States, including Nygard's estate in Lyford Cay, 
Bahamas, referred to as "Nygard Cay." Sex trafficking victims were transported internationally, 
including between the Bahamas and locations in the United States. 
The investigation of Peter Nygard and others is ongoing and no charges have been filed as 
of this date. The investigation has revealed that, on at least one occasion, Prince Andrew travelled 
to Nygard Cay in the Bahamas, a location where Nygard is believed to have trafficked minor and 
adult female victims. U.S. authorities seek to question Prince Andrew regarding his visit(s) to 
Nygard Cay during the time period under investigation, and other information he may have about 
Peter Nygard and related individuals. Prince Andrew is not presently a target of this investigation, 
and U.S. authorities have not, to date, collected evidence that he committed any crime under U.S. 
law.

produced ahead of triaL 
(2) All quarter entries (showing which cells he was housed in) for Jeffrey Epstein at MCC. I 
don't see why this necessarily needs to be held back; but at the same dine I think it's entirely

(3) The CIM Clearance and Separatee data sheet for Jeffrey Epstein at MCC. I don't believe he 
had any separates. I don't feel strongly about the CIM clearance. 
(4) The chronological disciplinary records for Jeffrey Epstein at MCC. This would only include 
the 7/23 suicide attempt, which should not be disclosed prior to trial because we may have 
witnesses testify about it. I would think this could be released after trial.

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 1 of 34 
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
United States of America, 
—v—
Ghislaine Maxwell, 
Defendant. 
USDC SDNY 
DOCUMENT 
ELECTRONICALLY FILED 
DOC N: 
DATE FILED: 4/16/21 
20-cr-330 (AJN) 
OPINION & ORDER 
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
In June 2020, a grand jury returned a six-count indictment charging Ghislaine Maxwell 
with facilitating the late financier Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse of minor victims from around 
1994 to 1997. The Government filed a first (S1) superseding indictment shortly thereafter, 
which contained only small, ministerial corrections. The SI superseding indictment included 
two counts of enticement or transportation of minors to engage in illegal sex acts in violation of 
the Mann Act and two counts of conspiracy to commit those offenses. It also included two 
counts of perjury in connection with Maxwell's testimony in a civil deposition. Trial is set to 
begin on July 12, 2021. 
Maxwell filed twelve pretrial motions seeking to dismiss portions of the Si superseding 
indictment, suppress evidence, and compel discovery. After the parties fully briefed those 
motions, a grand jury returned a second (S2) superseding indictment adding a sex trafficking 
count and another related conspiracy count. 
This Opinion resolves all of Maxwell's currently pending pretrial motions other than 
those seeking to suppress evidence, which the Court will resolve in due course. The motions, and 
this Opinion, deal exclusively with the S 1 superseding indictment and do not resolve any issues 
EFTA00022091
--- PAGE 2 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 2 of 34 
related to the newly added sex trafficking charges. For the reasons that follow, the Court denies 
Maxwell's motions to dismiss the SI superseding indictment in whole or in part. It grants her 
motion to sever the perjury charges for a separate trial. It denies her motion to further expedite 
discovery. 
The Court provides a brief summary of its conclusions here and its reasoning on the 
pages that follow: 
• 
Maxwell moves to dismiss all counts based on a non-prosecution agreement between 
Jeffrey Epstein and the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida. The Court 
concludes that the agreement does not apply in this District or to the charged offenses. 
• 
Maxwell moves to dismiss all counts as untimely. The Court concludes that the 
Government brought the charges within the statute of limitations and did not unfairly 
delay in bringing them. 
• 
Maxwell moves to dismiss the Mann Act counts because they are too vague, or in the 
alternative to require the Government to describe the charges in greater detail. The 
Court concludes that the charges are specific enough. 
• 
Maxwell moves to dismiss the perjury counts because, in her view, her testimony 
responded to ambiguous questioning and was not material. The Court concludes that 
these issues are best left for the jury. 
• 
Maxwell moves to sever the perjury counts from the Mann Act counts so that they can 
proceed in a separate trial. The Court concludes that severance is appropriate and will 
try the perjury counts separately. 
• 
Maxwell moves to strike language from the indictment that she believes is superfluous 
and to dismiss conspiracy counts she believes are redundant. The Court concludes that 
these motions are premature before trial. 
• 
Maxwell moves to compel the Government to immediately disclose certain categories 
of evidence. The Court concludes that she is not entitled to do so, but the Court will 
order Maxwell and the Government to confer on a discovery schedule. 
• 
Maxwell moves to dismiss all counts because a grand jury in White Plains, rather than 
Manhattan, returned the  Si superseding indictment. Because a jury in Manhattan 
returned the S2 superseding indictment, the motion appears moot.

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 3 of 34 
I. 
Jeffrey Epstein's non-prosecution agreement does not bar this prosecution 
In September 2007, under investigation by both federal and state authorities, Jeffrey 
Epstein entered into a non-prosecution agreement ("NPA") with the Office of the United States 
Attorney for the Southern District of Florida. Dkt. No. 142 at 1-2. Epstein agreed in the NPA to 
plead guilty in Florida state court to soliciting minors for prostitution and to serve eighteen 
months in a county jail. Id. In exchange, the U.S. Attorney's Office agreed not to charge him 
with federal crimes in the Southern District of Florida stemming from its investigation of his 
conduct between 2001 and 2007. Id. It also agreed not to bring criminal charges against any of 
his "potential co-conspirators." Id. 
As a recent report from the Department of Justice's Office of Professional Responsibility 
observed, the NPA was unusual in many respects, including its breadth, leniency, and secrecy. 
OPR Report, Gov. Ex. 3, Dkt. No. 204-3, at x, 80, 175, 179, 260-61. The U.S. Attorney's 
promise not to prosecute unidentified co-conspirators marks a stark departure from normal 
practice for federal plea agreements. This provision appears to have been added "with little 
discussion or consideration by the prosecutors." Id. at 169, 185. The report concluded that the 
U.S. Attorney's negotiation and approval of the NPA did not amount to professional misconduct, 
but nonetheless reflected "poor judgment." Id. at 169. 
Only the NPA's effect, and not its wisdom, is presently before the Court. Maxwell 
contends that the NPA bars this prosecution, because she is charged as a co-conspirator of 
Jeffrey Epstein and the NPA's co-conspirator provision lacks any geographical or temporal 
limitations. The Court disagrees for two independent reasons. First, under controlling Second 
Circuit precedent, the NPA does not bind the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New 
York. Second, it does not cover the offenses charged in the S1 superseding indictment. 
EFTA00022093

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 4 of 34 
A. The non-prosecution agreement does not bind the U.S. Attorney for the 
Southern District of New York 
United States Attorneys speak for the United States. When a U.S. Attorney makes a 
promise as part of a plea bargain, both contract principles and due process require the federal 
government to fulfill it. See Santobello v. New York, 404 U.S. 257, 262 (1971); United States v. 
Ready, 82 F.3d 551, 558 (2d Cir. 1996). The question here is not whether the U.S. Attorney for 
the Southern District of Florida had the power to bind the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District 
of New York. The question is whether the terms of the NPA did so. Applying Second Circuit 
precedent and principles of contract interpretation, the Court concludes that they did not. 
In United States v. Annabi, the Second Circuit held: "A plea agreement binds only the 
office of the United States Attorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it 
affirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction." 771 F.2d 670, 672 
(2d Cir. 1985) (per curiam). This is something akin to a clear statement rule. Single-district plea 
agreements are the norm. Nationwide, unlimited agreements are the rare exception. Applying 
Annabi, panels of the Second Circuit have stated that courts cannot infer intent to depart from 
this ordinary practice from an agreement's use of phrases like "the government" or "the United 
States." United States v. Salameh, 152 F.3d 88, 120 (2d Cir. 1998) (per curiam); United States v. 
Gonzalez, 93 F. App'x 268, 270 (2d Cir. 2004). Those are common shorthand. A plea 
agreement need not painstakingly spell out "the Office of the United States Attorney for Such-
and-Such District" in every instance to make clear that it applies only in the district where 
signed. 
Maxwell asks this Court to draw the opposite conclusion. The provision of the NPA 
dealing with co-conspirators does not expressly state that it binds U.S. Attorneys in other 
districts. It does not expressly state that it applies in other districts. The relevant language, in 
EFTA00022094
--- PAGE 5 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 5 of 34 
its entirety, reads as follows: "the United States also agrees that it will not institute any criminal 
charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein." Dkt. No. 142-1 at 5. Under Annabi, 
Salatneh, and Gonzalez, a statement that "the United States" agrees not to prosecute implies no 
restriction on prosecutions in other districts. 
Two provisions of the NPA refer specifically to prosecution in the Southern District of 
Florida. The first states that the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida will defer 
"prosecution in this District" if Epstein complies with the agreement. Dkt. No. 142-1 at 2. The 
second states that no prosecution "will be instituted in this District, and the charges against 
Epstein if any, will be dismissed" after he fulfills the agreement's conditions. Maxwell contends 
that the lack of similar language in the co-conspirator provision must mean that it lacks any 
geographical limitation. If anything, that language reflects that the NPA's scope was expressly 
limited to the Southern District of Florida. It is not plausible—let alone "affirmatively 
apparent", Annabi, 771 F.2d at 672,—that the parties intended to drastically expand the 
agreement's geographic scope in the single sentence on the prosecution of co-conspirators 
without clearly so saying. 
Without an affirmative statement in the NPA's text, Maxwell turns to its negotiation 
history. Under Second Circuit precedent she may offer evidence that negotiations of the NPA 
between the defendant and the prosecutors included a promise to bind other districts. See United 
States v. Russo, 801 F.2d 624, 626 (2d Cir. 1986). She alleges that officials in the U.S. 
Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida sought and obtained approval for the NPA 
from the Office of the Deputy Attorney General and communicated with attorneys in other 
districts. Any involvement of attorneys outside the Southern District of Florida appears to have 
been minimal. Maxwell has already received access to an unusually large amount of information 
EFTA00022095
--- PAGE 6 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 6 of 34 
about the NPA's negotiation history in the form of the OPR report and yet identifies no evidence 
that the Department of Justice made any promises not contained in the NPA. The OPR report 
reflects that the Office of the Deputy Attorney General reviewed the NPA, but only after it was 
signed when Epstein tried to get out of it. OPR Report at 103. Other documents show that 
attorneys in the Southern District of Florida reached out to other districts for investigatory 
assistance but not for help negotiating the NPA. Dkt. No. 204-2. Nor would direct approval of 
the NPA by the Office of the Deputy Attorney General change the meaning of its terms. No 
evidence suggests anyone promised Epstein that the NPA would bar the prosecution of his co-
conspirators in other districts. Absent such a promise, it does not matter who did or did not 
approve it. 
Second Circuit precedent creates a strong presumption that a plea agreement binds only 
the U.S. Attorney's office for the district where it was signed. Maxwell identifies nothing in the 
NPA's text or negotiation history to disturb this presumption. The Court thus concludes that the 
NPA does not bind the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. 
B. The non-prosecution agreement does not cover the charged offenses 
The NPA would provide Maxwell no defense to the charges in the Si superseding 
indictment even against an office bound to follow it. The NPA bars prosecution, following 
Epstein's fulfillment of its conditions, only for three specific categories of offenses: 
(1) "the offenses set out on pages 1 and 2" of the NPA; namely, "any offenses that 
may have been committed by Epstein against the United States from in or around 
2001 through in or around September 2007" including five enumerated offenses; 
(2) "any other offenses that have been the subject of the joint investigation by the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States Attorney's Office"; and 
(3) "any offenses that arose from the Federal Grand Jury investigation." 
EFTA00022096
--- PAGE 7 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 7 of 34 
Dkt. No. 142-1 at 2. The NPA makes clear that the covered charges are those relating to 
and deriving from a specific investigation of conduct that occurred between 2001 and 2007. 
Maxwell contends that the NPA's co-conspirator provision lacks any limitation on the 
offenses covered. The Court disagrees with this improbable interpretation. The phrase 
"potential co-conspirator" means nothing without answering the question "co-conspirator in 
what?" The most natural reading of the co-conspirator provision is that it covers those who 
conspired with Epstein in the offenses covered by the NPA for their involvement in those 
offenses. Thus, it would cover any involvement of Maxwell in offenses committed by Epstein 
from 2001 to 2007, other offenses that were the subject of the FBI and U.S. Attorney's Office 
investigation, and any offenses that arose from the related grand jury investigation. 
The Court has no trouble concluding that the perjury counts are not covered by the NPA. 
Those charges do not relate to conduct in which Maxwell conspired with Epstein and stem from 
depositions in 2016, more than eight years after Epstein signed the NPA. Maxwell now 
concedes as much, though her motion sought to dismiss the Si superseding indictment in its 
entirety, perjury counts and all. 
The Mann Act counts, too, fall comfortably outside the NPA's scope. The Si 
superseding indictment charges conduct occurring exclusively between 1994 and 1997, some 
four years before the period covered by the Southern District of Florida investigation and the 
NPA. The NPA does not purport to immunize Epstein from liability for crimes committed 
before the period that was the subject of the FBI and U.S. Attorney's Office investigation. 
Maxwell's protection is no broader. The Court thus concludes that the NPA does not cover the 
offenses charged in the SI superseding indictment. 
EFTA00022097

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 8 of 34 
C. Maxwell is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing 
In the alternative to dismissing the indictment, Maxwell requests that the Court conduct 
an evidentiary hearing as to the parties' intent in the NPA. The Court finds no basis to do so. 
The cases Maxwell cites where courts held hearings on the scope of a plea agreement 
mostly involved oral agreements where there was no written record of the full set of terms 
reached by the parties. All of them involved defendants with first-hand knowledge of 
negotiations who claimed prosecutors breached an oral promise. "An oral agreement greatly 
increases the potential for disputes such as . .. a failure to agree on the existence, let alone the 
terms, of the deal." United States v. Aleman, 286 F.3d 86, 90 (2d Cir. 2002). Thus, an 
evidentiary hearing may be necessary to determine the terms of an agreement never committed to 
writing. This is no such case. The NPA's terms are clear. Beyond the NPA itself, an extensive 
OPR report details its negotiation history. No record evidence suggests that prosecutors 
promised Epstein anything beyond what was spelled out in writing. The Court agrees with the 
Government that Maxwell's request for a hearing rests on mere conjecture. 
For the same reason, the Court will not order the discovery on the NPA. In any case, it 
appears that the Government has already produced two of the documents Maxwell seeks in her 
motion—the OPR report and notes mentioned in a privilege log. Of course, the Government's 
disclosure obligations would require it to disclose to Maxwell any exculpatory evidence or 
evidence material to preparing the defense, including any evidence supporting a defense under 
the NPA. The Government shall confirm in writing within one week whether it views any 
evidence supporting Maxwell's interpretation of the NPA as material it is required to disclose, 
and, if so, whether it has disclosed any and all such evidence in its possession.

II. 
The indictment is timely 
A. The indictment complies with the statute of limitations 
Federal law imposes a five-year limitations period for most non-capital offenses. 18 
U.S.C. § 3282(a). Recognizing the difficulty of promptly prosecuting crimes against children, 
Congress has provided a longer limitations period for "offense[s] involving the sexual or 
physical abuse, or kidnaping" of a minor. 18 U.S.C. § 3283. Until 2003, the operative version 
of § 3283 allowed prosecution of these offenses until the victim reached the age of twenty-five. 
Congress further extended the limitations period in the PROTECT Act of 2003, Pub. L. No. 108-
21, 117 Stat. 650, to allow prosecution any time during the life of the victim. 
The parties agree that the Mann Act charges are timely if subject to the PROTECT Act, 
but untimely under the general statute of limitations for non-capital offenses or the pre-2003 
version of § 3283. Maxwell contends that the charged offenses do not qualify as offenses 
involving the sexual or physical abuse or kidnapping of a minor and are thus governed by the 
general statute of limitations. Alternatively, she contends that the pre-2003 version of § 3283 
applies because the charged conduct occurred prior to 2003. The Court concludes that statute of 
limitations in the PROTECT Act applies and that the charges are timely. 
1. The Mann Act charges are offenses involving the sexual abuse of minors 
Maxwell does not dispute that the facts alleged in the SI superseding indictment involve 
the sexual abuse of minors. The indictment charges that Epstein sexually abused each of the 
alleged minor victims and that Maxwell allegedly enticed them to travel or transported them for 
that purpose. Instead, Maxwell contends that charged offenses do not qualify as offenses 
involving the sexual abuse of minors because sexual abuse is not an essential ingredient of each 
statutory offense. See Bridges v. United States, 346 U.S. 209, 221 (1953). In Maxwell's view, 
EFTA00022099
--- PAGE 10 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 10 of 34 
for example, it is possible to transport a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity 
and not follow through with the planned sexual abuse, and so sexual abuse is not an essential 
ingredient of the offense. Maxwell makes the same argument for the enticement and related 
conspiracy charges. 
This approach is analogous to the "categorical approach" employed by courts to evaluate 
prior convictions for immigration and sentencing purposes. See Taylor v. United States, 495 
U.S. 575, 602 (1990). Generally speaking, the "categorical approach" requires that courts "look 
only to the statutory definitions—i.e., the elements" of the relevant offense to determine if the 
provision applies "and not to the particular facts underlying those convictions." Descamps v. 
United States, 570 U.S. 254, 261 (2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). Whether a statute 
requires a categorical or case-specific approach is a question of statutory interpretation. To 
determine whether Congress used the word "offense" in a statute to refer to an offense in the 
abstract or to the facts of each individual case, the Court must examine the statute's "text, 
context, and history." United States v. Davis, 139 S. Ct. 2319, 2327 (2019). 
Though it has not authoritatively settled the question, the Second Circuit has strongly 
suggested that Maxwell's approach is the wrong one. In Weingarten v. United States, 865 F.3d 
48, 58-60 (2d Cir. 2017), the Second Circuit discussed at length how the text, context, and 
history of § 3283 show that Congress intended courts to apply the statute using a case-specific 
approach. The Third Circuit reached the same conclusion in United States v. Schneider, 801 
F.3d 186, 196 (3d Cir. 2015). 
The Court sees no reason to depart from the reasoning in Weingarten. First, "[t]he 
Supreme Court's modem categorical approach jurisprudence is confined to the post-conviction 
contexts of criminal sentencing and immigration deportation cases." Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 58. 
EFTA00022100
--- PAGE 11 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 11 of 34 
To the extent that the categorical approach is ever appropriate in other contexts, it is 
inappropriate here. 
The Court begins with the statute's text. Statutes that call for application of the 
categorical approach typically deal with the elements of an offense in a prior criminal conviction. 
Id. at 59. "The language of § 3283, by contrast, reaches beyond the offense and its legal 
elements to the conduct involv[ed]' in the offense. That linguistic expansion indicates Congress 
intended courts to look beyond the bare legal charges in deciding whether § 3283 applied." Id. at 
59-60 (alteration in original) (quoting § 3283). Maxwell cites one case holding otherwise, but 
that case involved a venue statute presenting significantly different concerns. See United States 
v. Morgan, 393 F.3d 192, 200 (D.C. Cir. 2004). The Supreme Court has likewise held that a 
statute which uses the language "an offense that . . . involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to 
the victim or victims exceeds $10,000" is "consistent with a circumstance-specific approach." 
Nijhawan v. Holder, 557 U.S. 29, 32, 38 (2009) (emphasis added). Thus, the word "involves" 
generally means that courts should look to the circumstances of an offense as committed in each 
case. This reading accords with a robust legislative history indicating that Congress intended to 
apply § 3283 to a wide range of crimes against children. See Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 60; 
Schneider, 801 F.3d at 196. 
The purposes underlying the categorical approach do not apply here either. For statutes 
dealing with prior convictions, "[t]he categorical approach serves `practical' purposes: It 
promotes judicial and administrative efficiency by precluding the relitigation of past convictions 
in minitrials conducted long after the fact." Moncrieffe v. Holder, 569 U.S. 184, 200-01 (2013). 
In the context of § 3283, there is no prior conviction to assess, and the jury will determine in the 
first instance whether "the defendant engaged in the applicable abusive conduct." Weingarten, 
EFTA00022101
--- PAGE 12 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 12 of 34 
865 F.3d at 60. Maxwell nonetheless contends that using a case-specific approach for § 3283 
would be impractical because the Government would need to prove conduct beyond the elements 
of the offense. It may be true that this approach requires the Government to prove some 
additional facts, but any statute-of-limitations defense presents factual issues (including, at least, 
when the alleged conduct took place). This is not a serious practical problem and does not 
justify setting aside the statute's language and apparent purpose. 
Maxwell relies primarily on Bridges v. United States, 346 U.S. 209 (1953), to urge this 
Court to cast Weingarten aside. The Supreme Court in Bridges addressed a statute that extended 
the limitations period for defrauding the United States during the Second World War. In that 
case, the Supreme Court first concluded that making false statements at an immigration hearing 
was not subject to the extended limitations period because it lacked any pecuniary element as 
required by the statute. Id. at 221. Then, as an alternative basis for its holding, it explained that 
the offense did not require fraud as an "essential ingredient." Id. at 222. It reached that 
conclusion in large part because the statute's legislative history made clear that Congress 
intended it to apply only to a narrow class of war frauds causing pecuniary loss. Id. at 216. 
As the Second Circuit explained in Weingarten, Congress had the opposite intent in the 
enacting in the PROTECT Act. Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 59 & n. 10. "In passing recent statutes 
related to child sex abuse, including extensions of the § 3283 limitations period, Congress 
`evinced a general intention to "'cast a wide net to ensnare as many offenses against children as 
possible."' Id. at 60 (quoting Schneider, 801 F.3d at 196 (quoting United States v. Dodge, 597 
F.3d 1347, 1355 (11th Cir. 2010) (en banc))). The primary basis for Bridges' holding—
legislative history supporting a narrow interpretation—does not exist here. Instead, both the 
statute's plan meaning and its legislative history suggest it should apply more broadly. 
EFTA00022102
--- PAGE 13 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 13 of 34 
Based on the statute's text, context, and history, the Court follows Weingarten and 
concludes that the appropriate inquiry is whether the charged offenses involved the sexual abuse 
of a minor on the facts alleged in this case. There is no question that they did. The Court thus 
concludes that § 3283 governs the limitations period for the charges here. 
2. The 2003 amendment to the statute of l"tations applies to these offenses 
Maxwell next contends that because the charged conduct took place before the 
PROTECT Act's enactment, that statute did not lengthen the statute of limitations applicable to 
her alleged offenses. Here too, the Second Circuit has provided guidance in its decision in 
Weingarten. Although the court did not provide a definitive answer there, it explained that the 
view Maxwell now takes conflicts with established principles of retroactivity and the decisions 
of at least two other circuit courts. Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 58 & n.8; see Cruz v. Maypa, 773 
F.3d 138, 145 (4th Cir. 2014); United States v. Leo Sure Chief, 438 F.3d 920, 924 (9th Cir. 
2006). 
The Supreme Court has set out a two-step framework to determine whether a federal 
statute applies to past conduct. See Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U.S. 244, 280 (1994). 
Courts look first to the language of the statute. If the statute states that it applies to past conduct, 
courts must so apply it. Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 54. Otherwise, the statute applies to past 
conduct unless doing so would create impermissible retroactive effects. Id. 
The Court begins with Landgraf s first step. To assess a statute's meaning here, courts 
must consider the text of the statute along with other indicia of congressional intent, including 
the statute's history and structure. See Enter. Mortg. Acceptance Co., LLC, Sec. Litig. v. Enter. 
Mortg. Acceptance Co., 391 F.3d 401, 406 (2d Cir. 2004). 
EFTA00022103
--- PAGE 14 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 14 of 34 
Section 3283, as amended by the PROTECT Act, broadly states that "[n]o statute of 
limitations that would otherwise preclude prosecution for an offense involving the sexual or 
physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child under the age of 18 years shall preclude such prosecution 
during the life of the child." The statute lacks an express retroactivity clause, but courts have 
held that no such clause is necessary, including for this particular statute. See Leo Sure Chief, 
438 F.3d at 923. The statute's plain language unambiguously requires that it apply to 
prosecutions for offenses committed before the date of enactment. Instead of simply providing a 
new limitations period for future conduct, Congress stated that no statute of limitations that 
would otherwise preclude prosecution of these offenses will apply. That is, it prevents the 
application of any statute of limitations that would otherwise apply to past conduct. 
Courts have reached the same conclusion for other statutes employing similar language. 
The Eighth Circuit has held that the 1994 amendments to § 3283, which allowed prosecution of 
sex crimes against children until the victim reached age twenty-five, applied to past conduct. See 
United States v. Jeffries, 405 F.3d 682, 684-85 (8th Cir. 2005). The Second Circuit has observed 
that the Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-26, 105 Stat. 123, 
illustrates language that requires a statute's application to past conduct. See Enter. Mortg. 
Acceptance Co., LLC, Sec. Litig., 391 F.3d at 407. That statute eliminated the statute of 
limitations for claims on defaulted student loans by stating that "no limitation shall terminate the 
period within which suit may be filed." Id. The PROTECT Act's language is quite similar. 
The history of § 3283 confirms Congress's intent to apply the extended limitations period 
as broadly as the Constitution allows. With each successive amendment to the statute, Congress 
further extended the limitations period, recognizing that sex crimes against children "may be 
difficult to detect quickly" because children often delay or decline to report sexual abuse. 
EFTA00022104
--- PAGE 15 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 15 of 34 
Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 54. Congress enacted the limitations provision of the PROTECT Act 
because it found the prior statute of limitations was "inadequate in many cases." H.R. Conf. 
Rep. No. 108-63, at 54 (2003). For example, a person who abducted and raped a child could not 
be prosecuted beyond this extended limit—even if DNA matching conclusively identified him as 
the perpetrator one day after the victim turned 25." Id. 
Maxwell makes no argument based on the statute's text. Instead, she contends that 
because the House version of the bill included an express retroactivity provision absent from its 
final form, the Court should infer that Congress did not intend the statute to apply to past 
conduct. However, the legislative history makes clear that Congress abandoned the retroactivity 
provision in the House bill only because it would have produced unconstitutional results. The 
Supreme Court has explained that a law that revives a time-barred prosecution violates the Ex 
Post Facto Clause of the Constitution, but a law that extends an un-expired statute of limitations 
does not. Stogner v. California, 539 U.S. 607, 632-33 (2003). Senator Leahy, who co-
sponsored the PROTECT Act, expressed concerns in a committee report that the proposed 
retroactivity provision was "of doubtful constitutionality" because it "would have revived the 
government's authority to prosecute crimes that were previously time-barred." 149 Cong. Rec. 
S5137, S5147 (Apr. 10, 2003) (statement of Sen. Leahy). Congress removed the provision 
shortly thereafter for this reason. The removal of the express retroactivity provision shows only 
that Congress intended to limit the PROTECT Act to its constitutional applications, including 
past conduct—like Maxwell's—on which the statute of limitations had not yet expired. 
Both the text and history of the PROTECT Act's amendment to § 3283 reflect that it 
applies Maxwell's conduct charged in the SI superseding indictment. The Court could stop here. 
EFTA00022105
--- PAGE 16 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 16 of 34 
However, it also concludes that even if the statute were ambiguous, it would properly apply to 
these charges. 
At Lanfgraf s second step, the Court asks whether application of the statute to past 
conduct would have impermissible retroactive effects. IA] statute has presumptively 
impermissible retroactive effects when it 'takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under 
existing laws, or creates a new obligation, imposes a new duty, or attaches a new disability, in 
respect to transactions or considerations already past.'" Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 56 (quoting 
Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 290). Thus, applying a new statute of limitations to previously time-
barred claims has an impermissible retroactive effect. Enter. Mortg. Acceptance Co., LLC, Sec. 
Litig., 391 F.3d at 407. Applying it to conduct for which the statute of limitations has not yet 
expired does not. Vernon v. Cassadaga Valley Cent. Sch. Dist., 49 F.3d 886, 890 (2d Cir. 1995). 
Maxwell concedes that these offenses were within the statute of limitations when 
Congress enacted the PROTECT Act. Thus, the Act did not deprive her of any vested rights. 
Maxwell contends that it is unfair to allow the Government to prosecute her now for conduct that 
occurred more than twenty years ago, but there is no dispute that Congress has the power to set a 
lengthy limitations period or no limitations period at all. It has done so here, judging that the 
difficulty of prosecuting these offenses and the harm they work on children outweighs a 
defendant's interest in repose. Maxwell's fairness argument is a gripe with Congress's policy 
judgment, not an impermissibly retroactive application of the statute. The Court concludes that 
§ 3283 allows her prosecution now. 
B. The Government's delay in bringing charges did not violate due process 
"As the Supreme Court stated in United States v. Marion, the statute of limitations is 'the 
primary guarantee against bringing overly stale criminal charges."' United States v. Cornielle, 
EFTA00022106
--- PAGE 17 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 17 of 34 
171 F.3d 748, 751 (2d Cir. 1999) (cleaned up) (quoting United States v. Marion, 404 U.S. 307, 
322 (1971)). There is a strong presumption that an indictment filed within the statute of 
limitations is valid. To prevail on a claim that pm-indictment delay violates due process, a 
defendant must show both that the Government intentionally delayed bringing charges for an 
improper purpose and that the delay seriously damaged the defendant's ability defend against the 
charges. See id. This is a stringent standard. "Thus, while the [Supreme] Court may not have 
shut the door firmly on a contention that at some point the Due Process Clause forecloses 
prosecution of a claim because it is too old, at most the door is barely ajar." DeMichele v. 
Greenburgh Cent. Sch. Dist. No. 7, 167 F.3d 784, 790-91 (2d Cir. 1999). 
The Court sees no evidence that the Government's delay in bringing these charges was 
designed to thwart Maxwell's ability to prepare a defense. However, it is enough to say that 
Maxwell does not make the strong showing of prejudice required to support this sort of claim. 
Maxwell contends that the Government's delay in bringing charges has prejudiced her interests 
because potential witnesses have died, others have forgotten, and records have been lost or 
destroyed. It is highly speculative that any of these factors would make a substantial difference 
in her case. 
Maxwell first points to several potential witnesses who have passed away. These include 
Jeffrey Epstein and his mother, one individual Maxwell believes worked with one of the alleged 
victims in this case, and a police detective who investigated Epstein in Florida. She contends 
they all would have provided exculpatory testimony were they alive today. Courts have 
generally found that vague assertions that a deceased witness might have provided favorable 
testimony do not justify dismissing an indictment for delay. See, e.g., United States v. Scala, 388 
F. Supp. 2d 396, 399-400 (S.D.N.Y. 2005). The Court agrees with this approach. Maxwell 
EFTA00022107
--- PAGE 18 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 18 of 34 
provides no indication of what many of these potential witnesses might have testified to. The 
testimony she suggests the detective might have offered—that witnesses in the Palm Beach 
investigation did not identify Maxwell by name—is propensity evidence that does nothing to 
establish her innocence of the charged offenses. There are also serious doubts under all of the 
relevant circumstances that a jury would have found testimony from Epstein credible even if he 
had waived his right against self-incrimination and testified on her behalf. See United States v. 
Spears, 159 F.3d 1081, 1085 (7th Cir. 1999). 
Maxwell's arguments that the indictment should be dismissed because of the possibility 
of missing witnesses, failing memories, or lost records fail for similar reasons. These are 
difficulties that arise in any case where there is extended delay in bringing a prosecution, and 
they do not justify dismissing an indictment. United States v. Marion, 404 U.S. 307, 325-26 
(1971); see United States v. Elsbery, 602 F.2d 1054, 1059 (2d Cir. 1979). 
Finally, the Court finds no substantial prejudice from the pretrial publicity this case has 
garnered. Maxwell contends that lengthy public interest in this case has transformed her 
reputation from that of Epstein's friend to a co-conspirator. And she also alleges—without 
evidence—that her accusers fabricated their stories based on media allegations. The Court will 
not dismiss the indictment on Maxwell's bare assertion that numerous witnesses are engaged in a 
perjurious conspiracy against her. And the Court will take all appropriate steps to ensure that the 
pretrial publicity in this case does not compromise Maxwell's right to a fair and impartial jury. 
The Court thus concludes that Maxwell has failed to establish actual prejudice from the 
Government's delay in bringing charges. She may renew her motion if the factual record at trial 
shows otherwise. On the present record, neither the applicable statute of limitations nor due 
process bars the charges here.

III. 
The indictment describes the charged offenses with specificity 
Maxwell seeks to dismiss the Mann Act counts for lack of specificity or in the alternative 
to compel the Government to submit a bill of particulars providing greater detail of the charges. 
The Court concludes that the charges in the S1 superseding indictment are clear enough. 
Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7, an indictment must contain "a plain, 
concise, and definite written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged." 
The indictment must be specific enough to inform the defendant of the charges and allow the 
defendant to plead double jeopardy in a later prosecution based on the same events. United 
States v. Stavrouiakis, 952 F.2d 686, 693 (2d Cir. 1992). "Under this test, an indictment need do 
little more than to track the language of the statute charged and state the time and place (in 
approximate terms) of the alleged crime." United States. v. Tramunti, 513 F.2d 1087, 1113 (2d 
Cir. 1975). In addition to dismissal, "Rule 7(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 
permits a defendant to seek a bill of particulars in order to identify with sufficient particularity 
the nature of the charge pending against him, thereby enabling defendant to prepare for trial, to 
prevent surprise, and to interpose a plea of double jeopardy should he be prosecuted a second 
time for the same offense." United States v. Bortnovsky, 820 F.2d 572, 574 (2d Cir. 1987). 
The S1 superseding indictment sets out the elements of each charged crime and the facts 
supporting each element. Nonetheless, Maxwell contends that the indictment is too vague 
because it refers to open-ended time periods, describes conduct like "grooming" and 
"befriending" that is not inherently criminal, and does not identify the alleged victims by name. 
Maxwell's first argument fails because the Government need only describe the time and 
place of charged conduct "in approximate terms." Tramunti, 513 F.2d at 1113. The details are 
subject to proof at trial. "[T]he Second Circuit routinely upholds the 'on or about' language used 
EFTA00022109
--- PAGE 20 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 20 of 34 
to describe the window of when a violation occurred." United States v. Kidd, 386 F. Supp. 3d 
364, 369 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (quoting United States v. Nersesian, 824 F.2d 1294, 1323 (2d Cir. 
1987)). "This is especially true in cases of sexual abuse of children: allegations of sexual abuse 
of underage victims often proceed without specific dates of the offenses." United States v. 
Young, No. 08-cr-285 (KMK), 2008 WL 4178190, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 4, 2008) (collecting 
cases). As here, these cases frequently involve alleged abuse spanning a lengthy period of time, 
and witnesses who were victimized as children may struggle to recall the precise dates when 
abuse occurred. The indictment adequately describes the time and place of the charged conduct. 
Maxwell next contends that allegations of noncriminal conduct render the charges 
impermissibly vague. The Court disagrees. Rule 7 requires only that the language of the 
indictment track the language of the statute and provide a rough account of the time and place of 
the crime. Tram ;;;; ti, 513 F.2d at 1113. The language of the Si superseding indictment does so. 
The Government's decision to provide more details than those strictly required does not hamper 
Maxwell's ability to prepare a defense. Maxwell's argument that some of the conduct alleged is 
not inherently criminal goes to the merits of the Government's case, not the specificity of the 
charges. 
Finally, Maxwell argues that the indictment is vague because the government does not 
provide the names of the alleged victims. The Court sees no basis to require that the alleged 
victims' names be included the indictment. The names of victims, even if important, generally 
need not appear there unless their omission would seriously prejudice the defendant. See United 
States v. Stringer, 730 F.3d 120, 127 (2d Cir. 2013); United States v. Kidd, 386 F. Supp. 3d 364, 
369 (S.D.N.Y. 2019). Maxwell likely knows the identity of the alleged victims described in the 
indictment at this point because the Government has provided extensive discovery on them. 
EFTA00022110
--- PAGE 21 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 21 of 34 
Moreover, the Government has agreed to disclose their names in advance of trial. There is thus 
no unfairness here. See Stringer, 730 F.3d at 126. As discussed below, the Court will require 
the parties to negotiate and propose a full schedule for all remaining pretrial disclosures. 
IV. 
The perjury charges are legally tenable 
The Court turns next to Maxwell's motion to dismiss the perjury counts stemming from 
her answers to questions in a deposition in a civil case. She contends that these charges are 
legally deficient because the questions posed were fundamentally ambiguous and the questions 
were not material to the subject of the deposition. The Court concludes that the charges are 
legally tenable and Maxwell's defenses are appropriately left to the jury. 
The applicable perjury statute imposes criminal penalties on anyone who "in any 
proceeding before or ancillary to any court ... knowingly makes any false material declaration." 
U.S.C. § 1623(a). Testimony is perjurious only if it is knowingly false and is material to the 
proceeding in which the defendant offered it. 
A. The questions posed were not too ambiguous to support a perjury charge 
The requirement of knowing falsity requires that a witness believe that their testimony is 
false. United States v. Lighte, 782 F.2d 367, 372 (2d Cir. 1986). As a general matter, "[a] jury is 
best equipped to determine the meaning that a defendant assigns to a specific question." Id. 
Courts have acknowledged a narrow exception for questions that are so fundamentally 
ambiguous or imprecise that the answer to them cannot legally be false. Id. at 372, 375; see also 
United States v. Wolfson, 437 F.2d 862, 878 (2d Cir. 1970). A question is fundamentally 
ambiguous only if reasonable people could not agree on its meaning in context. Lighte, 782 F.2d 
at 375. The existence of some arguable ambiguity does not foreclose a perjury charge against a 
witness who understood the question. 
EFTA00022111
--- PAGE 22 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 22 of 34 
At a minimum, Maxwell's motion is premature. Courts typically evaluate whether a 
question was fundamentally ambiguous only after the development of a full factual record at 
trial. See, e.g., United States v. Markiewicz, 978 F.2d 786, 808 (2d Cir. 1992). The evidence at 
trial may shed further light on whether the questions posed were objectively ambiguous in 
context or whether Maxwell subjectively understood them. In any event, the Court has closely 
considered each of the categories of questions that Maxwell argues are ambiguous. None of the 
alleged ambiguities Maxwell identifies rise to the level supporting dismissal of the charges. The 
context of the questions and answers, in conjunction with the Government's evidence, could lead 
a reasonable juror to conclude that the statements were perjurious. Truth and falsity are 
questions for the jury in all but the most extreme cases. The Court declines to usurp the jury's 
role on the limited pretrial record. 
B. A reasonable juror could conclude that Maxwell's statements were material 
Maxwell also argues that the perjury counts should be dismissed because none of the 
allegedly false statements were material to the defamation action. In a civil deposition, a 
statement is material if it has a natural tendency to influence the court or if a truthful answer 
might reasonably lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. United States v. Gaudin, 515 
U.S. 506, 509 (1995); United States v. Kross, 14 F.3d 751, 753-54 (2d Cir. 1994). Like knowing 
falsity, materiality is an element of the offense and thus ordinarily must be "decided by the jury, 
not the court." Johnson v. United States, 520 U.S. 461, 465 (1997). Only the most extraordinary 
circumstances justify departure from this general rule. United States v. Forde, 740 F. Supp. 2d 
406, 412 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (citing Gaudin, 515 U.S. at 522-23). 
The charged statements do not fall within this narrow exception. Maxwell contends that 
the questions did not relate to the sex trafficking and sexual abuse allegations at the center of the 
EFTA00022112
--- PAGE 23 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 23 of 34 
civil case, but that is not the legal standard. The Government may prevail if it proves that 
Maxwell's answers could have led to the discovery of other evidence or could influence the 
factfinder in the civil case. See Gaudin, 515 U.S. at 509; Kross, 14 F.3d at 753-54. At trial, a 
reasonable juror could conclude that truthful answers to the questions may have permitted the 
plaintiff to locate other victims or witnesses who could have corroborated the plaintiff's 
testimony. The factual disputes relating to materiality are at least enough to preclude pretrial 
resolution. In criminal cases, courts must guard against "invading the 'inviolable function of the 
jury' in our criminal justice system," and if the "defense raises a factual dispute that is 
inextricably intertwined with a defendant's potential culpability, a judge cannot resolve that 
dispute on a Rule 12(b) motion." United States v. Sampson, 898 F.3d 270, 281 (2d Cir. 2018). 
The Court concludes that the perjury charges are legally tenable and appropriately 
presented to the jury. 
V. 
The perjury charges must be severed and tried separately 
Although the perjury charges are legally tenable, the Court concludes that the interests of 
justice require severing those counts and trying them separately. Trying the perjury counts 
together with the Mann Act counts would require admitting evidence of other acts likely to be 
unduly prejudicial. It would also risk disqualifying Maxwell's chosen counsel based on their 
involvement in the earlier civil case. 
Rule 14(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure allows a court to order separate 
trials if joining all offenses in a single trial would prejudice the defendant. A defendant seeking 
severance must show significant unfairness to outweigh the burden on the court of conducting 
multiple trials. United States v. Walker, 142 F.3d 103, 110 (2d Cir. 1998). The harm to the 
defendant must be more than "solely the adverse effect of being tried for two crimes rather than 
EFTA00022113
--- PAGE 24 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 24 of 34 
one." United States v. Werner, 620 F.2d 922, 929 (2d Cir. 1980). Though this standard is 
demanding, the Court concludes that, due to unique features of the perjury counts, Maxwell 
meets it here. Trying all counts together would compromise Maxwell's right to the counsel of 
her choice and risk an unfair trial. 
Trying the perjury counts together with the Mann Act counts would risk an unfair trial on 
each set of counts. First, it would introduce unrelated allegations of sexual abuse, which would 
potentially expose the jury to evidence that might otherwise not be admissible. In particular, a 
joint trial would potentially expose the jury to a wider swath of information regarding civil 
litigation against Epstein that is remote from Maxwell's charged conduct. This presents a 
significant risk that the jury will cumulate the evidence of the various crimes charged and find 
guilt when, if considered separately, it would not do so. See United States v. Halper, 590 F.2d 
422, 430 (2d Cir. 1978). Second, the evidence presented on the Mann Act counts may prejudice 
the jury's ability to fairly evaluate Maxwell's truthfulness in her deposition, a critical element of 
the perjury counts. The Court has concerns that a limiting instruction may be inadequate to 
mitigate these risks given the nature of the allegations involved. 
Importantly, a joint trial is also likely to require disqualification of at least one of 
Maxwell's attorneys from participating as an advocate on her behalf. The perjury counts likely 
implicate the performance and credibility of her lawyers in the civil action—two of whom 
represent her in this case. The New York Rules of Professional Conduct generally forbid a 
lawyer from representing a client in a proceeding in which the lawyer is likely also to be a 
witness. N.Y. R. Prof'/ Conduct § 3.7(a). Maxwell's counsel in the civil action and the 
deposition may be important fact witnesses on the perjury counts. Even if counsel were not 
required to testify, trying all counts together could force Maxwell to choose between having her 
EFTA00022114
--- PAGE 25 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 25 of 34 
counsel testify on her behalf on the perjury charges and having them assist her in defending the 
Mann Act charges. 
The Second Circuit has recognized that witness testimony offered by a party's attorney 
presents serious risks to the fairness of a trial. See Murray v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 583 F.3d 173, 
178 (2d Cir. 2009). The lawyer might appear to vouch for their own credibility, jurors might 
perceive the lawyer as distorting the truth to benefit their client, and blurred lines between 
argument and evidence might confuse the jury. Id. Disqualification of counsel also implicates 
Maxwell's Sixth Amendment right to be represented by the counsel of her choice. See, e.g., 
United States v. Kincade, No. 15-cr-00071 (JAD) (GWF), 2016 WL 6154901, at *6 (D. Nev. 
Oct. 21, 2016). The prejudice to Maxwell is especially pronounced because the attorneys who 
represented her in the civil case have worked with her for years and are particularly familiar with 
the facts surrounding the criminal prosecution. See United States v. Cunningham, 672 F.2d 
1064, 1070-71 (2d Cir. 1982). 
The Court is of course cognizant of the burden separate trials may impose on all trial 
participants. But much of the proof relevant to the perjury counts and the Mann Act counts does 
not overlap. In particular, materiality for statements made in a civil deposition is broad, and 
evidence on that question is unlikely to bear on the other charges here. See Kross, 14 F.3d at 
753-54; Gaudin, 515 U.S. at 509. Although some allegations of sexual abuse are relevant to 
both sets of charges, many are not. At a minimum, this will expand the scope of the trial far 
beyond the narrower issues presented. And while the Court agrees with the Government that at 
least some of Maxwell's concerns are overstated, there is little question that the jury's 
consideration of the nature of the defamation action will require a significant investment of time 
and resources to provide the requisite context. 
EFTA00022115
--- PAGE 26 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 26 of 34 
The balance of these considerations favors severance. "Motions to sever are committed 
to the sound discretion of the trial judge." United States v. Casarnento, 887 F.2d 1141, 1149 (2d 
Cir. 1989). In its discretion, the Court concludes that trying the perjury counts separately will 
best ensure a fair and expeditious resolution of all charges in this case. 
VI. 
Maxwell's motion to strike surplusage is premature 
Maxwell moves to strike allegations related to one of the alleged victims from the SI 
superseding indictment as surplusage. The Court declines to do so at this juncture. 
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(d) allows a court to strike surplusage from an 
indictment on a defendant's motion. "Motions to strike surplusage from an indictment will be 
granted only where the challenged allegations are not relevant to the crime charged and are 
inflammatory and prejudicial." United States v. Hernandez, 85 F.3d 1023, 1030 (2d Cir. 1996) 
(cleaned up). Courts in this District generally delay ruling on any motion to strike until after the 
presentation of the Government's evidence at trial, because that evidence may affect how 
specific allegations relate to the overall charges. See, e.g., United States v. Nejad, No. I 8-cr-224 
(MN), 2019 WL 6702361, at *18 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 6, 2019); United States v. Mostafa, 965 F. 
Supp. 2d 451, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 2013). 
Maxwell contends that the allegations related to "Minor Victim-3" are surplusage 
because the indictment does not charge that Minor Victim-3 traveled in interstate commerce or 
was below the age of consent in England where the alleged activities took place. Thus, she 
argues, these allegations do not relate to the charged conspiracy and instead reflect an attempt to 
introduce Minor Victim-3's testimony for impermissible purposes. 
The Court will not strike any language from the S 1 superseding indictment at this 
juncture. The standard under Rule 7(d) is "exacting" and requires the defendant to demonstrate 
EFTA00022116
--- PAGE 27 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 27 of 34 
clearly that the allegations are irrelevant to the crimes charged. United States v. Napolitano, 552 
F. Supp. 465, 480 (S.D.N.Y. 1982). The indictment does not allege that the alleged victim 
traveled in interstate commerce or was underage during sexual encounters with Epstein. But the 
Court cannot rule out that the allegations may reflect conduct undertaken in furtherance of the 
charged conspiracy or be relevant to prove facts such as Maxwell's state of mind. See United 
States v. Concepcion, 983 F.2d 369, 392 (2d Cir. 1992). The Court will follow the well-worn 
path of others in this District and reserve the issue for trial. Maxwell may renew her motion 
then. 
VII. 
Maxwell's motion to dismiss multiplicitous charges is premature 
Maxwell's motion to dismiss either the first or third count of the SI superseding 
indictment as multiplicitous is also premature. Maxwell contends that the Government has 
alleged the same conspiracy twice in the indictment. "An indictment is multiplicitous when it 
charges a single offense as an offense multiple times, in separate counts, when, in law and fact, 
only one crime has been committed." United States v. Chacko, 169 F.3d 140, 145 (2d Cir. 1999). 
"The multiplicity doctrine is based upon the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment, 
which assures that the court does not exceed its legislative authorization by imposing multiple 
punishments for the same offense." United States v. Nakashian, 820 F.2d 549, 552 (2d Cir. 1987) 
(cleaned up). 
"Where there has been no prior conviction or acquittal, the Double Jeopardy Clause does 
not protect against simultaneous prosecutions for the same offense, so long as no more than one 
punishment is eventually imposed." United States v. Josephberg, 459 F.3d 350, 355 (2d Cir. 
2006). "Since Josephberg, courts in this Circuit have routinely denied pre-trial motions to 
dismiss potentially multiplicitous counts as premature." United States v. Medina, No. 13-cr-272 
EFTA00022117
--- PAGE 28 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 28 of 34 
(PGG), 2014 WL 3057917, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. July 7, 2014) (collecting cases). The Court therefore 
denies Maxwell's motion to dismiss multiplicitous counts without prejudice. 
VIII. The parties shall negotiate all remaining disclosures 
Maxwell moves to compel the Government to produce certain documents she believes it 
has in its possession and has failed to produce. She also seeks accelerated disclosure of the 
Government's witness list, Jencks Act material, Brady and Giglio material, co-conspirator 
statements, and Rule 404(b) material. Based on the Government's response in briefing and 
letters the parties have since submitted to the Court, it appears that most of these requests have 
been overtaken by events. Accordingly, although the Court concludes that Maxwell is not 
entitled to expedite this discovery based on the arguments in her motion papers, the Court will 
require the parties to confer on an overall schedule for all remaining pretrial disclosures. 
A. The Court accepts the Government's representations that it has disclosed all 
Brady and Giglio Material 
The Supreme Court's decisions in Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963) and Giglio v. 
United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972) require the Government to disclose to defendants certain 
evidence that will aid their defense. Brady requires disclosure of exculpatory evidence. Under 
Giglio, the Government has a duty to produce "not only exculpatory material, but also 
information that could be used to impeach a key government witness." United States v. Coppa, 
267 F.3d 132, 135 (2d Cir. 2001) (citing Giglio, 405 U.S. at 154). As a general rule, "Brady and 
its progeny do not require immediate disclosure of all exculpatory and impeachment material 
upon request by a defendant." Id. at 146. "[A]s long as a defendant possesses Brady evidence in 
time for its effective use, the government has not deprived the defendant of due process of law 
simply because it did not produce the evidence sooner." Id. at 144. 
EFTA00022118
--- PAGE 29 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 29 of 34 
Maxwell requests an order directing immediate disclosure of all Brady and Giglio 
material and also requests a few specific documents she contends the Government has failed to 
disclose. The Court begins with the specific requests. The requested materials include (1) 
records of witness interviews in connection with an ex pane declaration in support of a response 
to a motion to quash subpoenas; (2) an unredacted copy of two FBI reports; (3) pages from a 
personal diary that is in the custody of a civilian third party; and (4) copies of all subpoenas the 
Government has issued for Maxwell's records as part of its investigation in this case. 
The Government represents that it is cognizant of its Brady obligations, that is has 
reviewed the witness interviews and one of the FBI reports, and that neither set of documents 
includes exculpatory information not previously disclosed. The Court has no reason to doubt the 
Government's representation in this case that it is aware of its Brady obligations and that it has 
complied and will continue to comply with them. And because the witness statements are 
covered by the Jencks Act, the Court cannot compel production of such statements under the 
terms of the statute. See 18 U.S.C. § 3500; Coppa, 267 F.3d at 145. Next, the Government 
represents that it has already produced an unredacted copy of the other requested FBI report, and 
so that request is moot. The diary pages she requests are within the control of a civilian third 
party, not the Government, and so the Government need not (and perhaps cannot) produce them. 
See United States v. Collins, 409 F. Supp. 3d 228, 239 (S.D.N.Y. 2019). Finally, Maxwell's 
request for copies of all subpoenas the Government has issued is overly broad and lacks a legal 
basis. Maxwell is not entitled to compel production of these documents. 
The Court also will not issue an order requiring the immediate disclosure of Brady and 
Giglio material. The Government has represented that it recognizes its obligations under Brady 
and that it has complied, and will continue to comply, with such obligations. The Court has no 
EFTA00022119
--- PAGE 30 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 30 of 34 
reason to doubt these representations given its expansive approach to document production thus 
far in this case. The Government has agreed in its recent letter to produce Giglio material six 
weeks in advance of trial. The parties shall negotiate the specific timing, but assuming a 
schedule along those lines is met, the Court concludes that Maxwell will be able to effectively 
prepare for trial. See Coppa, 267 F.3d at 144. 
B. Jencks Act material and co-conspirator statements 
Maxwell also seeks to expedite discovery of Jencks Act material and non-exculpatory 
statements of co-conspirators that the government may offer at trial. The Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. 
§ 3500, "provides that no prior statement made by a government witness shall be the subject of 
discovery until that witness has testified on direct examination." Coppa, 267 F.3d at 145. The 
statute therefore prohibits a district court in most cases from ordering the pretrial disclosure of 
witness statements unless those statements are exculpatory. "A coconspirator who testifies on 
behalf of the government is a witness under the Act." In re United States, 834 F.2d 283, 286 (2d 
Cir. 1987). The Court therefore lacks the inherent power to expedite these disclosures. In any 
case, the Government has agreed to produce all Jencks Act material at least six weeks in advance 
of trial. 
The Court also rejects Maxwell's alternative request for a hearing to determine the 
admissibility of co-conspirator declarations. Co-conspirator statements may often be admitted at 
trial on a conditional basis. If the Court determines that the Government has not met its burden 
to show that the conditionally admitted statements were made in furtherance of the charged 
conspiracy, the Court should provide a limiting instruction or, in extreme cases declare a 
mistrial. United States v. Tracy, 12 F.3d 1186, 1199 (2d Cir. 1993). Although conditional 
admissions can pose a problem, a pretrial hearing is unnecessary here because the Government 
EFTA00022120
--- PAGE 31 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 31 of 34 
has committed to producing co-conspirator statements at least six weeks in advance of trial to 
allow Maxwell to raise any objections. Maxwell will have adequate time to object to any 
proffered co-conspirator testimony following the Government's Jencks Act disclosures. 
C. Witness list 
As a general matter, "district courts have authority to compel pretrial disclosure of the 
identity of government witnesses." United States v. Cannon, 528 F.2d 296, 300 (2d Cir. 1975). 
In deciding whether to order accelerated disclosure of a witness list, courts consider whether a 
defendant has made a specific showing that disclosure is "both material to the preparation of the 
defense and reasonable in light of the circumstances surrounding the case." United States v. 
Bejasa, 904 F.2d 137, 139-140 (2d Cir. 1990) (cleaned up). 
Maxwell has made a particularized showing that the Government must produce a witness 
list reasonably in advance of trial. The nature of the allegations in this case—decades-old 
allegations spanning multiple locations—present considerable challenges for the preparation of 
the defense. However, the Government's proposed disclosure schedule—which will afford 
Maxwell at least six weeks to investigate testifying witness statements—allows Maxwell 
significantly more time to review disclosures than schedules adopted in most cases in this 
District. See, e.g., United States v. Rueb, No. 00-CR-91 (RWS), 2001 WL 96177, at *9 
(S.D.N.Y. Feb. 5, 2001) (thirty days before trial); United States v. Nachamie, 91 F. Supp. 2d 565, 
580 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (fourteen days before trial). In addition, on April 13, 2021, the 
Government produced over 20,000 pages of interview notes, reports and other materials related 
to non-testifying witnesses. After considering the circumstances, including the complexity of the 
issues in this case and what the defense has already received and likely learned in the course of 
discovery, the Court concludes that the Government's proposal is generally reasonable.

D. Rule 404(b) material 
Maxwell's final discovery request is for early disclosure of evidence the Government 
seeks to offer under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(6). Under Rule 4O4(b), if the prosecutor in a 
criminal case intends to use "evidence of a crime, wrong, or other act" against a defendant, the 
prosecutor must "provide reasonable notice of the general nature of any such evidence that the 
prosecutor intends to offer at trial" and must "do so in writing before trial—or in any form 
during trial if the court, for good cause, excuses lack of pretrial notice." The Government 
represents that it will notify the defense of its intent to use 404(b) evidence at least 45 days in 
advance of trial to allow Maxwell to file any motions in limine to be considered at the final 
pretrial conference. The Government's proposal will give Maxwell an opportunity to challenge 
admission of that evidence and to bring to the Court's attention any issues that require resolution 
before trial. "This is all that Rule 404(b) requires." United States v. Thompson, No. 13-cr-378 
(AJN), 2013 WL 6246489, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3, 2013). The Court concludes this schedule is 
generally reasonable, although additional time to enable briefing and resolution in advance of 
trial is strongly encouraged. 
The Court's denial of Maxwell's requests to compel pretrial disclosures does not preclude 
the parties from negotiating in good faith for an expedited discovery timeline that will account 
for Maxwell's specific concerns. "[I]n most criminal cases, pretrial disclosure will redound to 
the benefit of all parties, counsel, and the court." United States v. Percevault, 490 F.2d 126, 132 
(2d Cir. 1974). In general, the Court will require the parties to negotiate a final, omnibus 
schedule to propose to the Court. The Court concludes that the disclosure of all of the above 
materials approximately six to eight weeks in advance of trial is appropriate and sufficient.

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 33 of 34 
Given the complexities of the case and the addition of two counts via the S2 indictment, the 
Court encourages the parties to agree to approximately eight weeks. 
IX. 
The S2 superseding indictment moots Maxwell's grand jury challenge 
The Court has not received supplemental briefing on the motions in light of the return of 
the S2 superseding indictment and so does resolve any such issues here.' However, Maxwell's 
motion seeking to dismiss the Si superseding indictment because it was returned by a grand jury 
sitting at the White Plains courthouse appears moot. Maxwell argued that the use of a grand jury 
drawn from the White Plains Division in this District did not represent a fair cross-section of the 
community, because her trial would proceed in the Manhattan Division. A grand jury sitting in 
Manhattan returned the S2 superseding indictment. By April 21, 2021, Maxwell shall show 
cause why her grand jury motion should not be dismissed on that basis. 
Conclusion 
The Court DENIES Maxwell's motions to dismiss the indictment as barred by Epstein's 
non-prosecution agreement (Dkt. No. 141), to dismiss the Mann Act counts as barred by the 
statute of limitations (Dkt. No. 143), to dismiss the indictment for pre-indictment delay (Dkt. No. 
137), to dismiss the Mann Act counts for lack of specificity (Dkt. No. 123), to dismiss the 
perjury counts as legally untenable (Dkt. No. 135), to strike surplusage (Dkt. No. 145), to 
dismiss count one or count three as multiplicitous (Dkt. No. 121), and to expedite pretrial 
disclosures (Dkt. No. 147). The Court GRANTS Maxwell's motion to sever the perjury counts 
for a separate trial (Dkt. No. 119). 
' The parties shall negotiate and propose a schedule for any available additional or supplement rulings in 
light of the filing of the S2 indictment.

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 34 of 34 
The Court ORDERS the Government to confirm within one week whether it considers 
any evidence related to negotiation of the non-prosecution agreement to constitute Brady or Rule 
material and, if so, to confirm that it has or will disclose such evidence. 
The Court further ORDERS the parties to negotiate a final schedule for all pretrial 
disclosures that remain outstanding, including: Brady, Giglio, and Jenks Act materials, including 
co-conspirator statements; non-testifying witness statements; testifying witness statements; the 
identity of victims alleged in the indictment; 404(b) material; and the Government's witness list. 
The Court also requires the parties to negotiate a schedule for any additional or supplemental 
motions briefing in light of the S2 indictment. The Court ORDERS a joint proposal to be 
submitted by April 21, 2021. If agreement is not reached, the parties shall submit their 
respective proposals. 
The Court further ORDERS Maxwell to show cause by April 21, 2021 why her motion to 
dismiss the SI superseding indictment under the Sixth Amendment (Dkt. No. 125) should not be 
denied as moot. 
SO ORDERED.

On trial. Ghislaine Maxwell—the 59-year-old British socialite who has 
pleaded not guilty to trafficking underage girls for sex with former boyfriend 
Jeffrey Epstein—is getting closer to her moment of reckoning. Final jury 
selection and opening arguments in her trial start today. Maxwell faces up 
to 40 years if convicted on the most serious charges. As for her time in jail, 
you guessed it: she hates it.

There are prosecutors who would be afraid to charge a case that would require them to prove sex crimes that took place 
in 1994. If you want to find them, you'll have to go to Florida. This is the Southern District of New York. 
It is never too late for justice. Sometimes, you just have to have faith in the power of the truth and hope twelve jurors 
will do the right thing. At this trial, brave women will take the witness stand and the truth will come out: Ghislaine 
Maxwell sexually exploited underage girls. She caused unspeakable harm to vulnerable kids. It is time to hold her 
accountable. 
vill open in the morning. Please come support. Details below. Updates to follow. 
Main courtroom: 40 Foley, courtroom 318 
Overflow courtrooms: 110, 506, 905, and 906. There is also a conference room on the first floor (room 130) that has a 
very small monitor with a live feed just for our office. 
Timing: we'll start at 8:30 a.m. with peremptory challenges, and we expect to go straight to preliminary instructions and 
opening statements. In order to get a seat, we'd recommend that you go over early.

• Recruited by unidentified female brunette in her 20s outside of her 
high school in the fall of 2001, when she was 14. 
• Joint visits with unidentified female for a month. Then solo trips to 
Epstein's house. 
• Regularly gave Epstein massages. Sometimes he masturbated. 
Manipulated into stripping down to her panties during the massages. 
Paid $300 each time. 
• "He would also like when I would play with his nipples. He used to get 
turned on by that. And then he would finish himself off and then that 
would be the end of it." 
• Over the next several months, 
visits followed a familiar 
routine. Epstein's secretary would contact her by email, beeper or 
her family's landline to set up a meeting, 
said. When she 
arrived, she'd be escorted to the elevator and head straight to the 
massage room. Once or twice a week for a year. 
• In the fall of 2002, Epstein said "Why don't we try something a little 
bit different?" she recalls him saying. "Why don't you do the massage 
on top of me?" 
said she told him that she wanted to "stick to 
the normal routine," but she ultimately removed her underwear. He 
fondled her privates, she said. Then he "brought me up there and it 
was very aggressive, it was forceful," she said. 
said she was 
terrified and told him to stop. "He was like, 'It's okay. You're fine. 
You're not doing anything wrong,' added=l, who said he did not 
use a condom. After it was over, 
said, she rushed out of the 
house angry and shaken.

Following up on our conversation from a few minutes ago, the Civil Division AUSA who handled the requests from counsel 
following Epstein's suicide was 
As I mentioned, the criminal team is happy to assist any civil AUSA(s) 
who are the point of contact, and we do think it would make sense to have a formal division to ensure that any necessary 
protocol is fully established and followed in connection with requests, including this current one, which we understand to 
be very narrowly tailored. As also discussed, we're happy to take a look at a draft letter to counsel explaining what their 
formal request should include (nature and status of litigation; what the requests are; and how the requested materials are 
pertinent to the active litigation, etc.). 
Please let us know if any additional information would be helpful, and thanks very much.

Following up on our brief discussion of this issue earlier this month, I wanted to see if you had any additional thoughts on 
how to handle requests from counsel for plaintiffs who are suing Epstein and his estate who ask us for information or 
materials in connection with our investigation — I think you had said we should instruct them to submit Touhy Requests, 
and that you would designate a Civil Division person to whom we could have them direct those requests. If that's right, 
could you please let us know who that person will be? So far we've just gotten the request from one plaintiff's counsel, 
Robbie Kaplan at Kaplan Hecker, and her request is very narrow but we want to set up the system in a way that will work if 
we get additional and/or more expansive requests going forward. And we would like to let her know how she should 
proceed relatively soon because that case has a status conference on January 10 and I think they'd like to make the 
request before then. 
Please let us know if any other information would be helpful, and thanks as always.

Re: 
Request for Information Relating to Jeffrey Epstein 
Dear Ms. Kaplan: 
I am the Assistant U.S. Attorney ("AUSA") who will be handling the request you 
discussed with AUSA 
for certain information relating to Jeffrey Epstein. Because 
your request seeks information from Department of Justice (the "Department") employees 
acquired as part of their performance of their official duties, your request is governed by certain 
Department regulations—commonly referred to as Touhy regulations—which, inter alia, prohibit 
any Department employee from disclosing such information "without prior approval of the 
proper Department official in accordance with §§ 16.24 and 16.25 of this part." 28 C.F.R. § 
16.22(a); see also United States ex rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951); 28 C.F.R. § 16.21 
et seq. The "proper official" in this case is Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States Attorney for 
the Southern District of New York. The Touhy regulations provide a set of procedures for the 
United States Attorney to follow when considering such requests. See 28 C.F.R. §§ 16.22(b), 
16.24. 
A party seeking to obtain records or employee testimony from the Department must first 
submit a written demand. See 28 C.F.R. § 16.22. To assist the United States Attorney in 
evaluating your request, we ask that this demand provide a detailed statement of the information 
sought; the litigation for which you seek this information; the pertinence of the information 
sought to your litigation; and the availability (or absence) of means in that litigation, including 
discovery, to obtain the information in question. See id. § 16.22(d). 
The U.S. Attorney will reach a determination regarding your request in light of the 
considerations codified at 28 C.F.R. §§ 16.24, 16.25, and 16.26. Such considerations include, 
inter alia, "[w]hether such disclosure is appropriate under the rules of procedure governing the 
case or matter in which the demand arose," 28 C.F.R. § 16.26(a)(1), and "[w]hether disclosure is 
appropriate under the relevant substantive law concerning privilege," including law enforcement 
privilege. 28 C.F.R. § I6.26(a)(2). Disclosure will not be made when, inter alia, "[d]isclosure 
would violate a statute ... or a rule of procedure, such as the grand jury secrecy rule," 28 U.S.C. 
§ 16.26(b)(I), "[d]isclosure would reveal a confidential source or informant," 28 U.S.C. § 
16.26(b)(4), or "[d]isclosure would reveal investigative records compiled for law enforcement 
purposes, and would interfere with enforcement proceedings or disclose investigative 
techniques," 28 U.S.C. § 16.26(b)(5). Applying these considerations, the Department will make 
appropriate disclosures when warranted. See 28 C.F.R. § 16.26(c).

My understanding is that you may intend to make a formal written request pursuant to the 
above-described regulations. If you choose to submit a written request, please send it directly to 
me. We will act upon an application made pursuant to the Department's regulations. 
Please contact me once you have had a chance to review this letter if you would like to 
discuss the issues herein further. 
Sincerely,

We're doing a brief follow up call this morning at 10 with the FCA, the British regulator who, as discussed, is looking at les 
Staley and his potential relationship with Epstein. No need at all to join if you're otherwise occupied — my guess is this will 
be a brief update (from them) and a request from us that they not go overt anytime soon — but if of interest, feel free to 
swing by at 10.

Mr. Taylor appears optimistic, but I can assure you that he will be ignored. The NCA works only for the 
Home Office and not the taxpayer. It is not a crime reporting agency. Neither is the SFO. The rest of 
the British police forces will not investigate serious economic crime unless pushed to do so by 
politicians or important people. 
This is why these types of crimes continue under the radar, and are affecting other nations and the 
global economy.

Dec 2019 
To Lynn Owens of the NCA: 
Dear Director General Lynn Owens, 
I wish to report serious matters of fraud, particularly those involved with Russian money 
laundering of gold bullion and their links to the Epstein paedophile ring which I believe is blackmailing 
Parliament. This email will serve to prove I did my civil duty and reported the crime at the highest level. 
I believe the Foreign Office had previously obstructed the NCA's investigations in these matters in 
2018, but this was under Theresa May, so perhaps you are now free to re-open the investigation. 
The possibility that gold bullion was used in the Laundromat Russian money laundering operation 
was raised by me in 2015 in the Birmingham Mercantile Court in lawsuit B40BM021. I had drawn the 
conclusion after reading of Deutsche Bank's $10 billion money laundering operation in the New Yorker 
for which they were later fined by the FCA in 2016. Deutsche Bank's conduct in my lawsuit suggested 
to me that they had destroyed bullion trading receipts, and that this incriminated executives in both 
auditing fraud and money laundering. It has not hard to put these two facts together. 
EFTA00022173
--- PAGE 2 ---
I believe that DB's position was so untenable it had to bribe a number of judges, regulator executives 
and politicians to make sure that no court or other agency would force disclosure of my receipts. 
Simon Brown QC, the judge in my first hearing ended up the butt of three sets of appeals, in which he 
was found guilty of gross misconduct and perverse verdicts. In each case the victim of his judgement 
was financially vulnerable and the opposing party of significant wealth. 
Unfortunately my attempt at an appeal was blocked by Lord Chief Justice Sir Ian Burnnet who 
refused me permission. The grounds of appeal clearly set out a case of corruption and required a 
transcript of hearing. Burnett closed the appeal without such a transcript, which was confirmed by the 
ICO after 6 months of obstruction from the judiciary. 
Burnett's decision had two effects - first it hid Deutsche Bank's gold and sivler manipulation from the 
public eye - until it was exposed in New York under Judge Valerie E Caproni. Secondly, by covering up 
destruction of bullion trading receipts it hid DB's involvement in the Dankse operation.... 
Asit turns out that Danske bank, via its Estonian branch, was using Deutsche Bank to underwrite its 
trades to the Russian Mafia, and this includes selling bullion without seals, certificates or receipts. 
It does not take too much imagination to see that if Danske had laundered as little as $1 billion in 
bullion that this would create serious accounting problems in DB's bullion inventories. The easiest way 
to conceal the degree of this fraud is to destroy en masse bullion trading receipts. 
In the court all judges refused to force DB to disclose my receipts - which is an outrageous violation 
of my Data Protection Rights and basic rights to a fair trial - as I was accused of not being able to 
quantify damages - even as defendants have refused to hand over receipts for such quantification, 
The ICO spent 15 months obstructing my SAR to DB for the receipts. Only by forceful 
correspondence from my constituency MP, Jeremy Lefroy, did they provide a response - and that was 
to refuse to hand over the receipts, citing a technicality in German Law. 
The FCA and the SFO refuse to investigate. It is quite obvious that all with the authority and power 
to force disclosure of receipts have been paid off not to do their duty. 
I have subsequently discovered that both Deutsche Bank and Barclays (also a defendant in my 
lawsuit) were involved in laundering money for Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein had blackmailed Parliament to 
put Jes Staley in charge of Barclays. This is established in a response from Parliament to a FOIA from 
me in which the Treasury Select Committee admit to having the blackmail emails. 
The fact that Staley is still in charge of Barclays tells us that the blackmail operation is still in effect 
and Staley is capable of corrupting the FCA, the PRA and the FRC, all of which have a duty to expel 
Staley from Barclays for his record with Epstein. 
Staley had threatened me with a restraining order and costs should I take Deutsche Bank to court. I 
also believe there is a very strong possibility that my friend Katherine Frisk, was murdered by Staley's 
operators to cover up the blackmail operation and she died in mysterious circumstances merely 48 
hours after ublishing the material on Staley in the International Reporter. Given that the FBI had told 
hat she is at risk of assassination for exposing the same blackmail ring, that 
possibility must be taken seriously. 
My lawsuit alleged manipulation of gold and silver prices, which has been proven true in subsequent 
settlements, prosecutions and fines against UBS, HSBC, JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank. 
The key evidence is linked here - it shows DB's public statements about its audits contradicted what 
it sent to me. The FCA refuse to press DB for an explanation, as do the courts. 
EFTA00022174
--- PAGE 3 ---
http://www.shyreman.com/docs/claim.bundle/evidence.for.fake.gold.audit.pdf
Clearly if the NCA's investigation could be quashed by Staley and co, every agency with a parallel 
investigation had to be compromised. 
It appears that Action Fraud, the ICO and the FCA all have a 95-99% disapproval rating. I hope the 
NCA can do better.

Mark Anthony Taylor

Let's put this language in our letter! Maybe in the paragraph I added at the end about checking ID's at the door? I think 
this is an important point. 
First, as the Indictment itself makes clear, the defendant's and Epstein's interactions with Minor Victim-3 were part 
of a broader scheme and agreement to entice and transport minor victims with intent to commit illegal sex acts. 
Even if Minor Victim-3 was not ultimately transported as a minor, the core of a conspiracy is an agreement to 
engage in criminal conduct; there is no legal requirement that the agreed upon crime be completed. 
Because a conspiracy does not require the completion of a substantive crime, it does not matter whether Minor 
Victim-3 was ever in fact transported as a minor,  or whether the elements of the substantive crimes of 
transportation an enticement are satisfied as to her. See Salinas, 522 U.S. at 65.

Whichever is easiest. 
Whenever you're at point when you have a sense of the timeline for this, that would be helpful to know — we'll need to 
send this to the defense with ample time to review for accuracy, so hoping to do that later this afternoon.

It is never too late for justice. Sometimes, you just have to have faith in the power of the truth and hope twelve jurors

DATE FILED: 
6/9/2020 
Cr. 830-2 (AT) 
ORDER 
ANALISA TORRES, District Judge: 
On November 19, 2019, Defendant Michael Thomas was charged with one count of 
conspiring to defraud the United States in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371, and three counts of 
making false statements with the intent to impede, obstruct, or influence the investigation or 
proper administration of a matter within the jurisdiction of a department or agency of the United 
States in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001(aX3). ECF No. 1. The indictment alleges that Thomas, 
in his capacity as a correctional officer at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (the "MCC"), 
along with another officer, co-Defendant Tova Noel, submitted several false "count slips" on the 
night of August 9, 2019 and the morning of August 10, 2019, certifying that he conducted counts 
of the inmates he was supervising in the MCC's Special Housing Unit ("SHU"), even though he 
did not conduct those counts. Id. ¶¶ 16, 30, 36, 38, 40. During that time period, one of the 
inmates in the SHU—Jeffrey Epstein—hanged himself in his cell. Id. ¶q 1, 26-27. 
Thomas now moves to compel the Government to produce evidence in connection with 
the trial scheduled to begin on January 4, 2021. Motion, ECF No. 33. Thomas seeks three 
categories of information: (1) "Nile report of the Inspector General" for the United States 
Department of Justice related to Epstein's death, and "any and all supplemental memorandums, 
written statements, photos, videos, and incident reports" obtained by the Inspector General's 
investigation, id, at 5; (2) "[a]ly and all internal investigative reports created by the [Bureau of

Prisons (the "BOP")] as to both [D]efendants, including[] any and all supporting memorandums, 
written statements, photos, videos, and incident reports," id. at 6; and (3) "any and all reports, 
memorandums, written statements, photos, videos, and incident reports created, manufactured, or 
possessed by any investigative or disciplinary agencies[] participating in the investigation of the 
[D]efendants, allied with the prosecution, and to which the prosecution has access," id. at 7. 
For the reasons stated below, Thomas' motion is DENIED. 
DISCUSSION 
The Government has already produced "surveillance video going back to July 5, 
2019 . . . ; count slips, thirty minute round forms, and staffing rosters for the three-week period 
surrounding Epstein's suicide; internal MCC phone records; employee files and staffing history 
for Noel and Thomas; and a wide range of written [BOP] policies and regulations," as well as 
"statements for all of the witnesses interviewed during the investigation." Gov't Opp. at 8-9, 
ECF No. 35. 
Thomas argues that he is entitled to additional discovery on two grounds: (1) Rule 16 of 
the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and (2) the constitutional guarantee of due process as 
expressed by the Supreme Court's decisions in Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), and 
Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972). Motion at 1. 
I. 
Legal Standards 
A. Rule 16 
Rule 16 requires the Government to "permit the defendant to inspect and to copy or 
photograph books, papers, documents, data, photographs, tangible objects, buildings or places, or 
copies or portions of any of these items, if the item is within the government's possession, 
EFTA00022187
--- PAGE 3 ---
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT Document 36 Filed 06/09/20 Page 3 of 9 
custody, or control and: (i) the item is material to preparing the defense; (ii) the [G]overnment 
intends to use the item in its case-in-chief at trial; or (iii) the item was obtained from or belongs 
to the defendant." Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(1)(E). "Evidence is material if it could be used to 
counter the [G]overnment's case or to bolster a defense." United States v. Ulbricht, 858 F.3d 71, 
109 (2d Cir. 2017) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), abrogated on other grounds 
by Carpenter v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 2206 (2018). "In order to compel the Government to 
produce certain evidence, a defendant must make a prima facie showing of materiality, and must 
offer more than the conclusory allegation that the requested evidence is material." United States 
v. Abdalla, 317 F. Supp. 3d 786, 790 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (internal quotation marks and citation 
omitted). "There must be some indication that the pretrial disclosure of the disputed evidence 
would enable the defendant significantly to alter the quantum of proof in his favor." United 
States v. Urena, 989 F. Supp. 2d 253, 261 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (internal quotation marks, citation, 
and alterations omitted). 
Evidence is "within the [G]ovemment's possession, custody, or control" if "(1) it has 
actually reviewed [the evidence], or (2) [the evidence is] in the possession, custody, or control of 
a government agency so closely aligned with the prosecution so as to be considered part of the 
prosecution team." United States v. Finnerty, 411 F. Supp. 2d 428, 432 (S.D.N.Y. 2006). 
"Legal ownership of the requested documents or things is not determinative, nor is actual 
possession necessary if the party has control of the items. Control has been defined to include 
the legal right to obtain the documents requested upon demand. The term `control' is broadly 
construed." United States v. Stein, 488 F. Supp. 2d 350, 361 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) (internal quotation 
marks and citation omitted) (collecting cases). 
EFTA00022188
--- PAGE 4 ---
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT Document 36 Filed 06/09/20 Page 4 of 9 
If the Government represents that it "it has fully complied with [its Rule 16] obligations 
and will continue to do so," the defendant must put forward some "compelling demonstration to 
the contrary" by pointing to a "specific failure by the Government to comply with its disclosure 
obligations" in order to justify a motion to compel. United States v. Minaya, 395 F. Supp. 2d 28, 
(S.D.N.Y. 2005). 
B. BradylGiglio 
Under the Supreme Court's decision in Brady v. Maryland, the Government "has a 
constitutional duty to disclose evidence favorable to an accused when such evidence is material 
to guilt or punishment," and as elaborated in Giglio v. United States, that obligation extends to 
"not only exculpatory material, but also information that could be used to impeach a key 
[G]overnment witness." United States v. Coppa, 267 F.3d 132, 135 (2d Cir. 2001). "Evidence is 
material within the meaning of Brady when there is a reasonable probability that, had the 
evidence been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would have been different." Turner v. 
United States, 137 S. Ct. 1885, 1893 (2017) (internal quotation marks, citations, and alteration 
omitted)); see also Coppa, 267 F.3d at 135 ("[T]he prosecutor must disclose evidence if, without 
such disclosure, a reasonable probability will exist that the outcome of a trial in which the 
evidence had been disclosed would have been different."). 
"The prosecution's obligation to disclose Brady material extends to any material in the 
possession of any entity that has acted as an `arm of the prosecutor' in a given case." United 
States v. Middendorf, No. 18 Cr. 36, 2018 WL 3956494, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 17, 2018) 
(quoting United States v. Blaszczak, 308 F. Supp. 3d 736, 741 (S.D.N.Y. 2018)). "A 
prosecutor's duty to review documents in the possession, custody, or control of another agency 
EFTA00022189
--- PAGE 5 ---
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT Document 36 Filed 06/09/20 Page 5 of 9 
arises where the Government conducts a joint investigation with another agency." United States 
v. Collins, 409 F. Supp. 3d 228, 239 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (internal quotation marks and citation 
omitted). In determining whether the prosecution has conducted a joint investigation, courts in 
this district look to a number of non-exhaustive factors, "including whether the other agency: (1) 
participated in the prosecution's witness interviews, (2) was involved in presenting the case to 
the grand jury, (3) reviewed documents gathered by or shared documents with the prosecution, 
(4) played a role in the development of prosecutorial strategy, or (5) accompanied the 
prosecution to court proceedings." Id. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). 
As under Rule 16, if the Government has represented that it is aware of and has complied 
with its Brady and Giglio obligations, a defendant must make a "particularized showing that 
materials exist requiring disclosure" in order to sustain a motion to compel. United States v. 
Juliano, No. 99 Cr. 1197, 2000 WL 640644, at ■2 (S.D.N.Y. May 18, 2000); see United States v. 
Evanchik, 413 F.2d 950, 953 (2d Cir. 1969) ("[T]he assurance by the [G]overnment that it has in 
its possession no undisclosed evidence that would tend to exculpate defendant justifies the denial 
of a motion for inspection that does not make some particularized showing of materiality and 
usefulness.") 
II. 
Inspector General Materials 
Thomas seeks disclosure of both the investigatory materials from the Department of 
Justice Office of the Inspector General's ("OIG") investigation regarding Epstein's death, and a 
draft of the Inspector General's report arising from that investigation. Motion at 5. The 
Government concedes that attorneys from OIG participated in the Government's investigation 
that led to the indictment of Thomas. Gov't Opp. at 3, 19. But, the Government represents that 
EFTA00022190
--- PAGE 6 ---
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT Document 36 Filed 06/09/20 Page 6 of 9 
it has already delivered to Thomas all of the materials gathered by OIG personnel in the course 
of investigating this case, and that "it is the prosecution's understanding that [OIG] attorneys 
have not conducted any additional interviews or otherwise discovered any potential Brady 
material." Id. at 23-24. Thomas has not identified any specific material that might be in OIG's 
possession that has not been disclosed. 
The Court, therefore, has no basis to compel the Government to disclose additional 
evidence underlying the Inspector General's report. "[C]ourts in this circuit have repeatedly 
denied requests for discovery orders where the [G]overnment represents that it has produced 
discovery to defendants pursuant to Rule 16 and has made a good faith representation to the 
defense that it recognizes and has complied with its obligations under Brady and its progeny." 
United States v. Garcia-Pena, No. 17 Cr. 363, 2018 WL 6985220, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 19, 
2018) (internal quotation marks, citation, and alterations omitted); see also, e.g., United States v. 
Blondet, No. 16 Cr. 387, 2019 WL 5690711, at *5 ("[T]o the extent that these motions seek 
evidence pursuant to Brady [], Giglio [], and their progeny, they are [denied] on the basis of the 
Government's good-faith representation that it has complied with its obligations and will 
continue to do so." (citations omitted)); United States v. Goode, No. 16 Cr. 529, 2018 WL 
919928, at *18 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 15, 2018) ("The Government represents that it has complied with 
Rule 16 obligations; the Rule 16 requests are therefore moot." (citation omitted)). 
As for the draft Inspector General's report itself, the Government reports that "attorneys 
from [OIG] responsible for writing the [r]eport have not yet completed a draft, and do not 
anticipate completing the [r]eport in the near term," and so "there are no drafts of the [r]eport to 
EFTA00022191
--- PAGE 7 ---
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT Document 36 Filed 06/09/20 Page 7 of 9 
disclose." Gov't Opp. at 21-22. The Court cannot grant a motion to compel the Government to 
produce a report that, at the time of this order, does not exist.I
Accordingly, Thomas' motion to compel disclosure of materials related to the Inspector 
General's investigation is DENIED. 
III. 
BOP Materials 
Thomas also seeks disclosure of "reports generated by investigators within the [BOP] 
regarding" Epstein's death, and "any and all documents, reports, witness statements and 
disciplinary records of any and all MCC employees who have engaged in conduct" similar to 
that alleged against Thomas. Motion at 6. However, Thomas has adduced no evidence that the 
Government reviewed information arising from a BOP investigation. Nor has he shown that 
BOP officials "participated in the prosecution's witness interviews," were "involved in 
presenting the case to the grand jury," "reviewed documents gathered by or shared documents 
with the prosecution," "played a role in the development of prosecutorial strategy," 
"accompanied the prosecution to court proceedings," or in any other way played a role in the 
investigation that led to the charges against him. Collins, 409 F. Supp. 3d at 239 (internal 
quotation marks, citation, and alteration omitted). There is, therefore, no evidence that BOP 
personnel participated in the criminal investigation that led to Thomas' indictment. Thus, the 
Court concludes that the BOP was not part of the prosecution team for purposes of Rule 16 and 
Brady. 
To be sure, the BOP is a component of the Department of Justice, but that fact standing 
alone is not sufficient to make the BOP an arm of the prosecution. "The court cannot find that 
Because the Court denies Thomas' motion on the ground that no material exists to disclose, it does not address 
whether the Inspector General's report might contain information material to his defense, nor whether it is protected 
by the deliberative process privilege. See Gov't Opp. at 12-15,22-23. 
EFTA00022192
--- PAGE 8 ---
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT Document 36 Filed 06/09/20 Page 8 of 9 
the government is in constructive possession of the materials where, as here, defendant has not 
presented any evidence suggesting that the BOP was involved in the investigation or prosecution 
of this case." United States v. Rivera, No. 13 Cr. 149, 2015 WL 1540517, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 
7, 2015); see, e.g., United States v. Merlin, 349 F.3d 144, 155 (3d Cir. 2003) (holding that 
Government did not violate Brady obligation in failing to turn over tapes in BOP possession 
because "the BOP was not part of the prosecutorial arm of the federal government as it was not 
at all involved in either the investigation or the prosecution of the defendants"); United States v. 
Battle, 264 F. Supp. 2d 1088, 1201-02 (N.D. Ga. 2003) ("Defendant implies that because the 
BOP employees are connected with the Department of Justice that the prosecution team 
constructively possessed exculpatory information that could have been within the knowledge of 
BOP staff.... Even if the Court assumes that some members of the BOP staff did possess 
favorable information that alone does not impute knowledge to the prosecution team." (citing 
United States v. Avellino, 136 F.3d 249, 255 (2d Cir. 1998)). 
Accordingly, Thomas' motion to compel the Government to disclose evidence in the 
possession of the BOP is DENIED. 
IV. 
Other Materials
Finally, Thomas seeks disclosure of information that he argues will tend to show that the 
conduct for which he is being prosecuted was: "1) rampant throughout the BOP; 2) made with 
knowledge and acquiescence by the leadership of the BOP; 3) made as a result of BOP policies 
that forced the defendant to engage in conduct for which he is now being charged criminally, 
and; 4) made in a manner which contains a possible discriminatory application of BOP policies 
by [G]overnment prosecutors." Motion at 7. But Thomas has not provided support for his 
EFTA00022193
--- PAGE 9 ---
Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT Document 36 Filed 06/09/20 Page 9 of 9 
assertion that the Government, or any other agency that has operated as an arm of the 
prosecution, is in possession or control of evidence that relates to the prevalence of falsifying 
count slips in federal correctional facilities, or BOP leadership's tolerance of such practices. 
Moreover, to the extent that Thomas is seeking discovery in support of a selective 
prosecution defense, he has not met the "rigorous" standard that applies for obtaining discovery 
in aid of such a claim. United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 468 (1996). "[A] defendant 
who seeks discovery on a claim of selective prosecution must show some evidence of both 
discriminatory effect and discriminatory intent." United States v. Bass, 536 U.S. 862, 863 
(2002). Though Thomas claims that BOP supervisors may have acquiesced in his submission of 
false count slips in this case, and that other BOP employees have submitted false documents in 
other circumstances, he has not presented any evidence that those officers differed from him in 
any protected characteristic-for example, that they were of a different race, sex, or ethnicity. 
See Motion at 10. Nor has Thomas put forward any evidence of a discriminatory motive for his 
prosecution. 
Accordingly, Thomas' motion to compel the Government to disclose evidence that the 
submission of false count slips was widespread and tolerated at the BOP, and for discovery 
related to selective prosecution, is DENIED. 
CONCLUSION 
For the reasons stated, Thomas' motion to compel is DENIED. The Clerk of Court is 
directed to terminate the motion at ECF No. 33.

Hi 
Thanks so much for your help with the Maxwell discovery so far. I have some follow-up questions about the most recent 
batch you provided, and wanted to check in on the longer term tasks we discussed last month. 
Below are some questions regarding the discovery Paul dropped off a few days ago with requests for additional items: 
• 
The last page of the attached appears to be a photograph of a disc. The label on the disc seems to suggest it 
contains grand jury transcripts. Have you given us those transcripts? 
• 
The message pad scans you provided still have post-it notes on top of several of the message pad pages. I think 
Mandy mentioned that each pad had been scanned twice, but I'm only seeing one copy of each pad—and those 
copies all of post-its on them. That's true of nearly every "Notebook" pdf you provided in the "Message pad 
scans" folder. Would you please get us a scans of these without post-its on them? 
• 
It looks like we're still missing SW returns for the 20 mag 6719 warrant and for the NH premises warrant. Would 
you please get us copies of those returns? 
Following up on our conversation last month, I think we're still waiting on the below items from you guys. Would you 
please be able to get us these this week? 
• 
Full FBI sentinel file 
• 
CART paperwork regarding the extraction of data from all devices seized during the investigation 
• 
All 302s regarding the extraction of data from any seized devices and the review of images (both digital and hard 
copy) seized during the investigation, including from Epstein's properties. 
• 
Scans of the files Reiter provided to the FBI and provide us with all of those scanned materials 
• 
Scans of all hard copy documents, including photos, in the possession of the FBI that have not yet been scanned, 
including anything seized during any searches. Please produce to SDNY all of those scans, except any nude or 
partially nude images. For nude or partially nude images, please provide us with a log detailing how many such 
images were scanned, where they were from, and where they are being stored. 
• 
Copies of the contents of all the discs that were seized and searched pursuant to search warrants to a platform 
for review. Then please produce to SDNY a copy all of those materials, except any nude or partially nude images. 
For nude or partially nude images, please provide us with a log detailing how many such images were located, 
where they were from, and where they are being stored. 
Please let me know if you have any questions or if it would be useful to hop on a call.

Dear 
Apologies for the slight delay. 
Please find attached an extract from The Decision Procedure and Penalties manual (DEPP 7) from the Financial Conduct 
Authority handbook — drawing attention to 7.2.14. This practice and approach resonates with the law as set out in United 
States v. Allen, 864 F.3d (2d Cir.2017). We also attach an extract from the publication `Montgomery and Ormerod on 
Fraud: Criminal Law and Procedure' (2008) which summarises the approach taken by the Serious Fraud Office (see A7-
327) to the limitations and protections on use when their compulsory powers are used in MLAT requests, an approach 
which reflects such cases as Kastigar v. United States, 406 U.S. 441 (1972) as well as decisions in UK domestic law. We 
reiterate the protection at Article 7 (2) of the MLAT treaty although there is no need to attach it.

lane-Images: image001.jpg; image002.jpg 
Gary, 
We write to follow up on our prior discussions. As discussed on our last call, our standard proffer agreement 
understandably has different provisions and protections than would result from a compelled interview pursuant to an 
MLAT request. It is often the case that individuals who want to voluntarily assist with our investigations do not require any 
protections, but nevertheless, when individuals we are seeking to interview do request certain protections as part of a 
voluntary interview, we ordinarily find that the proffer agreement language is appropriate and sufficient. Nevertheless, 
based on your queries, we would be prepared to include the following language in a proffer agreement governing a 
voluntary, live interview of your client: 
- Absent a court order directing otherwise, the SDNY will not use or disclose the content of the witness's statements 
in an interview with law enforcement in any matter other than a criminal investigation, prosecution, or related 
civil action or asset forfeiture action initiated by the United States government. 
We are not able to provide a broader grant of immunity with respect to statements made by your client during a voluntary 
interview. As we discussed on the phone, in a voluntary interview the individual being interviewed has the right to choose 
not to answer any particular question, has the right to consult with counsel at any time, and may explain the context or 
basis of answers to whatever extent necessary. Accordingly, and also considering the obvious problems with granting 
broad immunity to an interviewee for statements not yet made, we do not believe it would be necessary or appropriate 
to further diverge from our standard practice. We are also not aware of any treaty provision that would preclude 
prosecution for intentional and willful false or misleading statements. 
Regarding your request that we provide subject areas of the interview in advance, we have generally described those 
subjects with you in our phone conversations, but we reiterate them here for your convenience. In a voluntary interview 
with your client, we would expect to ask questions (and follow-up questions, as appropriate), about topics including, and 
with the understanding that the answers to questions about these topics might naturally flow into additional topics, the 
following: the duration and nature of your client's relationships with Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein, and their 
respective (or joint) employees or associates; communications your client has had relating to individuals associated with 
Ghislaine Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, including communications in person, via phone, via email, or via other means, and 
including but not limited to communications with Maxwell or Epstein themselves; any such communications your client 
had, or was aware of, with or about potential or actual contact with girls or women in connection with sexual activity or 
possible sexual activity; and information relating to any other individuals of whom your client is aware who might have 
information relating to these or other similar topics. These subjects would naturally include, but not be limited to, 
questions relating to any individuals who have made public accusations that relate to our investigation. This description is 
not meant to be exhaustive or exclusive, but rather to guide your understanding of the kind of information we believe 
your client may be able to provide to assist our investigation. 
Finally, you previously have asked if we are able to state whether individuals have made accusations that your client 
committed a crime. To avoid any confusion or miscommunication, we want to reiterate that we are not able to convey any 
confidential information from our investigation, including any potential witness statements or other investigative results, 
as they relate to any particular individual, including your client, other than through judicial processes. As I have noted 
previously, we obviously are aware of certain accusations made publicly. 
We look forward to speaking with you tomorrow.

Gary, 
A brief update to the below information — I should have included the specific jury instruction elements for 18 U.S.C. 
1001, subsection (2), which likely would be more applicable to a prosecution based on a proffer statement. Although 
the knowing and willful element in particular is identical, we nevertheless wanted to provide this to you as well. 
Pursuant to Sand, Modern Federal Jury Instructions, Instruction 36-9 (Elements of the Offense), those elements are: 
First, on or about the date specified, the defendant made a statement or representation; 
Second, that this statement or representation was material; 
EFTA00022203
--- PAGE 4 ---
Third, the statement or representation was false, fictitious or fraudulent; 
Fourth, the false, fictitious or fraudulent statement was made knowingly and willfully; and 
Fifth, the statement or representation was made in a matter within the jurisdiction of the government of the United 
States (or federal funds were involved).

Subject: RE: Sensitive Correspondence 
Gary, 
We write to follow up on our conversation yesterday, to confirm certain aspects of our discussion and to provide 
certain information you requested. First, thank you for conveying your questions, and I hope our initial responses were 
of some use. To provide additional information that may be helpful, attached please find a blank proffer agreement, 
which is our standard form agreement for proffer interviews, as you requested. Please note that in addition to the 
provisions I briefly described on our call, there are also provisions that may not be relevant to your client. We 
nevertheless send the complete agreement for your review. 
Additionally, and also as requested, certain information relating to Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001, is 
provided below. 
In relevant part, that statute states the following: "Except as otherwise provided in this section, whoever, in any matter 
within the jurisdiction of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the Government of the United States, 
knowingly and willfully-(1) falsifies, conceals, or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact; (2) makes 
any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation; or (3) makes or uses any false writing or 
document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry [is guilty of an 
offense). The full language of the statute is also available here. 
Regarding the elements required to prove such an offense, pursuant to Sand, Modern Federal Jury Instructions, 
Instruction 36-3 (Elements of the Offense), a conviction for this offense require that the following elements each must 
be proven beyond a reasonable doubt: 
First, that on or about the date specified in the indictment, the defendant falsified (or concealed or covered up) a 
material fact; 
Second, that the fact falsified (or concealed or covered up) was material; 
Third, that defendant did so by trick, scheme or device; 
Fourth, that defendant acted knowingly and willfully; and 
Fifth, that the falsification, concealment or coverup was with respect to a matter within the jurisdiction of the 
government of the United States (if applicable: or that federal funds were involved). 
You may note in particular the inclusion of the "knowingly and willfully" requirement, as we discussed. 
We also understand that you will send us, to the extent you believe it is relevant or helpful for our consideration, any 
particular provisions or protections contemplated under the MLAT process, and which of those, if any, you believe are 
relevant, or should be applicable, to a voluntary interview. 
We look forward to speaking with you again this coming Monday, August 3, at 4:00 p.m. (LDN time), and we further 
confirm, as discussed, that our Office is prepared to extend the Negotiation Period, referenced in our email of July 14, 
2020, for two weeks from our call yesterday, to August 10, 2020, under the terms previously mutually agreed upon.

A. Introduction 
[A.7.03] 
A. Introduction 
This chapter examines the means by which the UK assists and seeks the assistance of foreign A.7.01 
states+ in the investigation and prosecution of fraud and related offences.2 
In this chapter the term 'foreign state' includes the Channel Islands. the Isle of Man. and British Overseas 
Territories, which are responsible themselves for providing mum] assistance in response to requests from 
ocher countries. 
But note that the Crime (International Co-operation) Act 2003 (CICA) also permits the UK to provide 
assistance in relation CO administrative proceedings and demency proceedi ng,s in foreign states. There arc 
also statutory powers enabling foreign states to seek assistance in relation to financial and regulatory 
matters under the Companies Act 1989 and the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. Part 1 of the 
Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 contains provisions relating to mutual assistance in the 
interception of communications. There are also a range of provisions for the exchange of information in 
tax matters. see eg the European Administrative Cooperation (Taxation) Regulations 2012. SI 2012/ 
3062. 
The two principal pieces of legislation+ in this field are: 
A.7.02 
• the Crime (International Co-operation) Act 2003 (CICA 2003). CICA 2003 contains 
provisions allowing the UK to seek and provide assistance in a number of ways, including 
the provision of evidence and information; the service of process, the enforcement of 
foreign driving disqualifications, and other related matters? CICA 2003 repealed the 
Criminal Justice (International Cooperation) Act 1990 however ss 5, 6, 9, and 10 of the 
1990 Act remain in force; 
• the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (External Requests and Orders) Order 2005 (the POCA 
Order); enables the UK to restrain assets at the request of foreign states and also to 
enforce external confiscation orders! 
The enforcement of foreign judgments in civil proceedings is outside the scope of this work. For a recent 
analysis of the provisions concerning enforcement of foreign orders in insolvency proceedings. and the 
Foreign Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act 1933 and s 426 of the Insolvency Act 1986. see New 
Cap Reinsurance Corporation Ltd (in liquidation) v Grant 120121 Ch 538. CA. 
The provisions of CICA 2003 relating to service of process and driving disqualifications are not covered 
in this chapter. For further details. see C Nicholls, C Montgomery and IS Knowles. The Law of 
Extradition and Mutual Assistance (3rd edn, 2013), chs 22 and 23. 
SI 2005/3181, Made under POCA. 
Part 3 of the Criminal Justice (International Co-operation) Act 1990 (Enforcement of Overseas 
Forfeiture Orders) Order 2005 (SI 2005/3180) contains similar powers enabling forfeiture of the 
instrumentalities of crime at the request of foreign states, as to which see generally Malabu Oil and Gas 
Ltd v Dimes, of -Public Prosecutions (20161 Lloyd's Rep FC 108. 
(a) Relationship between international agreements on mutual assistance 
and domestic legislation 
The development of mutual assistance legislation in the UK has primarily been driven by A.7.03 
mutual legal assistance treaties and other international agreements. These instruments had 
the effect of requiring the UK to adapt its laws so as to enable it to honour its international 
obligations. It is thus convenient to consider these agreements first before describing the 
domestic legislation.

[A.7.04] 
Chapter A7: Mutual Legal Assistance in Cases of Fraud 
A.7.04 However, unlike in respect of extradition, it should be noted at the outset that the domestic 
mutual assistance scheme does not require the existence of a treaty as a pre-condition for the 
granting of mutual assistance. The UK is able, in general, to offer assistance to any state 
whether or not that country is able to reciprocally assist the UK, and whether or not there 
is a bilateral or multilateral agreement in place.' 
Mutual Legal Attittante Guidelines for the United Kingdom (12th edn. Home Office. March 2015). p 5. 
A.7.05 Mutual legal assistance treaties therefore have a dual role to play in the mutual assistance 
process. First, they can be used as an aid to the interpretation of relevant legislation.' In 
particular, parts of the CICA 2003 give effect to international agreements and framework 
decisions, and these domestic provisions fall to be interpreted in light of the international 
instrument to which they give effect.2 Secondly, the Secretary of State and the court must 
take into account treaty provisions when considering the extent to which assistance should 
be granted under the CICA 2003 or other legislation?

(b) International developments 
A.7.06 Among the most important multilateral conventions and agreements in relation to mutual 
assistance ratified by the UK are the Council of Europe's Convention on Mutual Assistance 
in Criminal Matters 1959' (the 'European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal 
Matters) and its First and Second Additional Protocols? the Council of Europe's Conven-
tion on Laundering, Search, Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds from Crime 1990;3
and the Commonwealth Scheme (the 'Harare Scheme')fi 
ETS No 30. 
ETS No 99 and ETS No 182. The second Additional Protocol came into force in the UK on 1 October 
2010. 
ETS No 141. There is also a Council of Europe Convention on the Laundering, Search, Seizure and 
Confiscation of the Proceeds from Crime and on the Financing of Terrorism (CETS No 198). which the 
UK ratified in 2015.

A. Introduction 
[A.7.11] 
Kingdom's membership of the European Union, held on 23 June 2016, led to a decision to 
withdraw from EU membership. Notice of intention to leave the EU ('Brexit) was served 
under Art 50 TEL) on 29 March 2017. Withdrawal was due to take effect on 29 March 
2019 but at the date of writing had been postponed. Consequently, the UK's continued 
participation in EU mutual recognition instruments remains the subject of significant 
uncertainty (see pan A.7.17).3

Arrest Warrant', 6th Report of Session 2017-19. 
The UK is also a signatory to a number of bilateral mutual legal assistance treaties.' Among A.7.08 
these are the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty with the US, which entered into force on 
February 1996. The Foreign Office maintains a list of all bilateral agreements.2

(if European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters 
One of the first international instruments to respond to the effects of cross-border criminal A.7.09 
activity was the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters) 
Although this opened for signature in 1959, it was not ratified by the UK until 1991 when 
the Criminal Justice (International Cooperation) Act 1990 came into force. Art 3(1) of the 
Convention provides that: 
The requested Party shall execute in the manner provided for by its law any letters 
rogatory relating to a criminal matter and addressed to it by the judicial authorities of 
the requesting Party for the purpose of procuring evidence or transmitting articles to 
be produced in evidence, records or documents. 
ETS No 30. See generally. D McClean, International Cooperation in Civil and Criminal Matters 
(2012). p 170. 
The Additional Protocol to the Convention, which opened for signature in 1978, contains A.7.10 
provisions intended to relax the Convention's restrictions on assistance in relation to fiscal 
offences. The Second Additional Protocol facilitates the exchange or disclosure of infor-
mation by broadening the range of situations in which mutual assistance may be requested 
and by making the provision of assistance easier, quicker and more flexible. This includes 
the creation of joint investigation teams (JIT),I

The European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters was an important A.7.11 
achievement for its time in its recognition of the necessity for specific instruments for 
cooperation in evidence gathering. However, like all new instruments, it had limitations. 
Perhaps the most notable was that the Convention was designed to operate amongst states 
of like legal tradition, namely the civil law states of Europe, and it was geared towards legal 
systems where criminal prosecutions were under the control of an investigating judge.

A.7.12 The Commonwealth Scheme was adopted by Commonwealth Law Ministers in Harare, 
Zimbabwe, in August 19861 and has been amended since in 2002, 2005, and 2011. It is 
not treaty-based and depends for its effective operation on the passage by all members of 
the Commonwealth of domestic legislation, including legislation to enable the exercise of 
powers and functions by their law enforcement and curial bodies on behalf of other 
Commonwealth countries.

A.7.13 The Commonwealth Scheme provides for a wider range of assistance than its Council of 
Europe counterpart and recognises the common law independence of the police in 
conducting investigations, as well as a non-judicial prosecutor exercising a prosecutorial 
discretion. The types of assistance envisaged by the Scheme include: 
• obtaining and taking of evidence; 
• making available records and other documents; 
• facilitating the appearance of witnesses (including persons in custody) provided such 
persons consent; 
• interception of telecommunications and postal items; 
• covert electronic surveillance; 
• the use of live video links in the course of investigations and judicial procedures; 
• asset recovery; and 
• issuing of process for compulsory measures including search and seizure.

A.7.15 The principal aim of the Convention is to prevent corruption from occurring. The 
Convention requires countries to establish criminal and other offences to cover a wide 
range of acts of corruption, if these are not already crimes under domestic law. Chapter IV 
of the Convention deals with international cooperation consequent to that. Countries 
agreed to cooperate with one another in every aspect of the fight against corruption, 
including prevention, investigation, and the prosecution of offenders. Countries are bound 
by the Convention to render specific forms of mutual legal assistance in gathering and 
transferring evidence for use in court, and to extradite offenders. Countries are also

required to undertake measures which will support the tracing, freezing, seizure, and 
confiscation of the proceeds of corruption.' 
I See generally C Nicholls er 21. Comrption and Miswe of Public Office (3rd edn. 2017). 
(c) EU developments 
In October 1999 at Tampere, the European Council adopted a legislative approach called A.7.16 
mutual recognition as the cornerstone ofjudicial cooperation in the EU. This followed the 
institutional changes brought about by the Treaty of Amsterdam.' Mutual recognition 
presents a significant departure from existing mutual assistance procedures.2 The tradi-
tional 'request principle' for mutual assistance entails requests being addressed from 
executive to executive through their national ministries. Such requests could be refused on 
a wide variety of domestic discretionary principles including specialty,3 double criminal-
ity," the political offence exceptions and the bar on extraditing nationals.' However, this 
made outcomes slow, cumbersome, and often unreliable. Mutual recognition has been 
embraced to change this by leaving decision-making predominantly with the judiciary. 
Under mutual recognition, judicial decisions by one EU state can be implemented in 
another with limited grounds for refusal and without any real consideration of the 
processes by which these decisions were reached.' This inevitably impacts on the individual 
by permitting their direct exposure to other European criminal justice systems. 
I 1997 OJ O340/1. 
See Madarel. 'Surrendering' the Fugitive—The European Arrest Warrant and the United Kingdom. 
JoCL 71 (362) 2007. 
The specialty principle generally acts as a bar on an extradited person being prosecuted for anything 
other than the offence for which s/he was extradited. 
This is the principle that extradition or mutual assistance will be refused for acts that are not also defined 
as crimes in the jurisdiction dealing with the request. 
This exception is a general baron the extradition of alleged offenders who are sought for political activity 
and is aimed at preventing persecution. 
This bar has its basis in the link between allegiance and protection between state and its nationals, the 
right of a state to prosecute and punish its own nationals, and in a distrust of other criminal justice 
systems. 
Peers. 'Mutual Recognition and Criminal Law Has the Council got it wrong?' CMLR 41:5-36 (2004). 
p.10. 
The mutual recognition agenda sought to revolutionise mutual legal assistance within the A.7.16A 
EU as legal instruments progressively replaced traditional mutual legal assistance conven-
tions. To date there have been a number of EU initiatives in the area of criminal mutual 
assistance that have had an important impact on the UK's domestic legislation, including 
CICA 2003. 
However, the legal situation has recently become complicated. Protocol 36 of the Treaty of A.7.17 
Lisbon permitted the UK Government to decide by 31 May 2014 whether it intended to 
continue to be bound by unamended, pre-Lisbon EU police and criminal justice (PCJ) 
measures. This allowed the UK to withdraw from these measures before they became 
subject to the jurisdiction of the Court ofJustice of the European Union and the European 
Commission's enforcement powers. Under Art 10(4) of Protocol 36, the UK indicated it 
Fraud 
A-7011

--- PAGE 12 ---
(A.7.18] 
Chapter A7: Mutual Legal Assistance in Cases of Fraud 
was withdrawing from all such measures with effect from 1 December 2014. It then set out 
its intention to opt back into 35 selected measures. The measures included many mutual 
recognition instruments and a number of other key instruments (eg legislation establishing 
Europol and Eurojust and legislation on joint investigation teams and criminal records). 
Twenty-nine measures, including Europol, Eurojust, and joint investigation teams were 
eventually re-joined. For a while, therefore, normality was resumed.' However, the UK's 
subsequent decision to withdraw from the EU leaves numerous issues pertaining to the 
future status of these instruments to be addressed within the exit negotiations.2 The UK 
Government has identified 'cooperating in the fight against crime and terrorism' as one of 
its twelve guiding principles in the 'Break negotiations? But there is no guarantee as yet 
that an effective legal framework for mutual recognition of judgments can be maintained, 
there being no precedents for many of the arrangements which need to be put in place. 
A significant potential stumblingblock is the role of the Court ofJustice of the EU (CJEU). 
As taking `control of our own laws' was a core motivator behind the decision to leave the 
EU, any CJEU jurisdiction in relation to UK cooperation arrangements will remain highly 
contentious.6 Possible alternative models of cooperation may potentially be found in the 
extradition agreement negotiated by Iceland and Norway with the EU.6 This requires 
the parties to 'keep under review' the development of the case law of the CJEU and the 
domestic courts of Iceland and Norway. Agreement on these issues is yet to be reached.

A.7.18 The UK Government has noted that, following the UK's withdrawal from the EU, the UK 
will be a `third country' (external country) in its dealings with the Union. It has suggested: 
One option for haute EU—UK cooperation in this area would be to limit cooperation 
to those areas where a precedent for cooperation between the EU and third countries 
already exists. While this would be one possible approach, it would result in a limited 
patchwork of cooperation falling well short of current capabilities. It would also fall 
short of current channels used to assess the strategic threats facing European 
countries—threats that will still be shared after the UK withdraws from the EUA 
piecemeal approach to future UK—EU cooperation would therefore have more 
limited value, and would risk creating operational gaps for both the UK and for its 
European partners, increasing the risk for citizens across Europe.'

A. Introduction 
[A.7.21] 
At the time of writing, the future of mutual legal assistance in the criminal sphere between 
the UK and the EU remains extremely uncertain. With that caveat, we outline in s (i) below 
the EU mutual legal assistance scheme in which the UK participates, as it currently stands. 
HM Government, 'Security, Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice: A Future Partnership'. 18 Septem-
ber 2017. pan 35. 
(I) The Schengen Convention+ 
France, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands agreed on 14 June 1985 to A.7.19 
sign an agreement on the gradual abolition of checks at their common borders. This 
became known as the Schengen Agreement, after the name of the town in Luxembourg 
where it was signed. 
I See generally. D McClean. International Cooperation in Civil and Criminal Masters (2012), p 157. 
The Convention Implementing the Schengen Convention was signed in June 1990 and A.7.20 
came into effect in March 1995.' By that time, other EU Member States had joined the 
initial signatories of this inter-governmental agreement, which was signed outside the EU 
framework because of a lack of agreement in relation to competence in the areas of border 
control. The Convention has 142 articles providing measures for creating a common area 
ofjustice and security, following abolition of common borders. Its key aims are to facilitate 
free movement within participating states; to improve police cooperation; to extend the 
provision of mutual legal assistance between signatory states; and to improve access to the 
Schengen Information System (515). 
01 L 239. 22.09.2000, p 19. 
The SIS was set up to allow police forces and consular agents from the Schengen countries A.7.21 
to access data on specific individuals (ie criminals wanted for arrest or extradition, missing 
persons, third-country nationals to be refused entry, etc) and on goods which have been lost 
or stolen. The data related to persons may include data on: persons wanted for arrest for 
extradition purposes; aliens for whom an alert has been issued for the purposes of refusing 
entry; and missing persons or on persons needing temporary police protection, among 
other things. A second technical version of this system PS II) entered into operation on 
April 2013. It has enhanced functionalities, such as the possibility to use biometrics, new 
types of alerts, the possibility to link different alerts (such as an alert on a person and a 
vehicle) and a facility for direct queries on the system. It also ensures stronger data 
protection.' It is a database of 'real-time alerts about individuals and objects of interest to 
EU law enforcement agencies.2 Each participating country has a SIRENE (Supplementary 
Information Request at the National Entry) Bureau, to provide supplementary informa-
tion and coordinate activities. The UK connected to SIS II in April 2015.3At the time of 
writing most information about persons of interest to law enforcement within the EU are 
dealt with by SIS II. The most likely replacement for the system when and if the UK leaves 
the 515 is the Interpol system of notifications.

participate in some aspects of the Schengen acquit (the police and judicial cooperation

the Schengen acquit into the framework of the European Union.' Art 4 to Protocol 19 
provides that the UK may request to take part in some or all provisions of the Schengen 
acquit. Art 5 of Protocol 19 provides that the UK is deemed to opt in to measures building 
on parts of the acquit in which it participates unless, within three months of the publication 
of the proposal or initiative, it notifies the Council that it does not wish to take part in the 
measure—'an opt-out'. If the UK does not opt out within that three-month period, it is 
automatically bound. If the UK opts out, the Commission and Council can decide to eject 
the UK from all or part of the rest of Schengen to the extent considered necessary if such 
non-participation seriously affects the practical operability of the system but the Protocol 
states explicitly that it must seek to retain the UK's widest possible participation.2

Access to the S1S after withdrawal from the EU will be a complex issue for Brexit A.7.25 
negotiations. There is no precedent for providing such access to a country which is neither 
a Member State nor a Schengen country. Any future agreement on UK access will doubtless 
require the UK to continue to apply standards consistent with EU data protection 
legislation. There is equally no precedent on which the UK could rely to argue for 
continued access to SIS 11.1 
See evidence of Security Commissioner Julian King to the House of Commons Home Affairs Commit-
tee, 28 February 2017. according to which outside of non-EU Schengen countries there are no 
precedents for third countries accessing those information-sharing platforms (Q92). 
(ii) Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between EU Member 
States and its Protocol 
On 29 May 2000 the EU Council of Ministers adopted the Convention on Mutual A.7.26 
Assistance in Criminal Matters.' The Convention did not enter force until 2005. Art 1 of 
the Convention explains that its purpose is to supplement the provisions between Member 
States of inter alia the the Council of Europe's 1959 Convention on Mutual Assistance in 
Criminal Matters and its Additional Protocol, and the mutual assistance provisions of the 
Schengen Convention. The EU Convention does not affect the application of more 
favourable provisions in bilateral or multilateral agreements between Member States or 
criminal mutual assistance arrangements agreed2 on the basis of uniform legislation or 
other special arrangements. 
OJ 197. 12.07.2000. p 3. See Explanatory Report on the Convention of 29 May 2000 on Mutual 
Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member SUMS of the European Union. OJ C 379. 
29.12.2000. p 7. 
As provided for in the Council of Europe's European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal 
Matters. Art 26(4). 
Thus the EU Convention aims to encourage and modernise cooperation between judicial, A.7.27 
police, and customs authorities within the EU as well as with Norway and Iceland by 
supplementing provisions in existing legal instruments and facilitating their application. 
The state receiving a request must in principle comply with the formalities and procedures 
initiated by the requesting state. 
Forms of assistance provided for by the Convention include: 
A.7.28 
• the handing over of objects that have been stolen or obtained by other criminal means 
and that are found in another Member State; 
• hearings by video or telephone; 
• the setting up of a joint investigation team by two or more EU Member States for a 
specific purpose and for a limited period of time, as well as joint covert investigations; 
• requests for the interception of telecommunications.

A.7.30 The European Investigation Order Directive has effectively superseded many of the 
Convention's provisions (at para A.7.36 below). However, as noted above (para A.7.17), 
once the withdrawal process under Art 50 (including any transitional period) is complete, 
some EU law measures, including the EU Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal 
Matters and the European Investigation Order Directive, will be terminated unless UK 
third-country access is successfully negotiated. The EU allows third-state participation in 
some of its mutual legal assistance arrangements.' An alternative to negotiating third-state 
access to the network of existing MLA agreements would be a UK—EU MLA treaty.2 Again, 
the role of the CJEU would be highly contentious. 
I See. eg, Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of 
Norway on the application of certain provisions of the Convention of 29 May 2000 on Mutual 
Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member Sures of the European Union and the 2001

(iii) Council Framework Decision on the execution in the EU of orders freezing 
property or evidence 
A.7.31 After the Framework Decision on the European Arrest Warrant, the European Council first 
extended the mutual recognition principle to mutual legal assistance matters with the 
Framework Decision on pre-trial orders freezing property or evidence.This was adopted by 
the EU Council of Ministers on 22 July 2003 on an initiative by Belgium, France, and 
Sweden. Its purpose is to establish the rules under which a Member State is to recognise and 
execute in its territory a freezing order issued by a judicial authority of another Member 
State in the framework of criminal proceedings. 
I 20031577/J14A. 22 July 2003: OJ L 196, 2.08.2003. 
A.7.32 A 'freezing order' means any measure taken by a judicial authority in a Member State to 
prevent the destruction, transformation, displacement, etc of property. The evidence to 
which the Framework Decision applies includes objects, documents, or data which could 
be produced as evidence in criminal proceedings. 
A.7.33 The Framework Decision (2003/577/JHA) was given effect to in Pan 1 of CICA 2003' 
and by the Crime and Courts Act 2013 (which replaces the Serious Organised Crime & 
Police Act 2005). However, the scheme remained restricted to the freezing phase, such that 
a freezing order still needed to be accompanied by a separate MIA request for the 
subsequent transfer of the evidence to the issuing state. Because of this need to resort to 
co-existing MLA arrangements in any event, the 2003 scheme was seldom used in practice.

Matters between the Member States of the European Union (OJ C 326, 21/11/2001 p0001-0008)). 
CICA 2003 also implements other EU legislation, including the Convention 981C 216/01 on Driving 
Disqualifications (as to which, see aLso S.I. 3010 of 2008; The Mutual Recognition of Driving 
Disqualifications (Great Britain and Ireland) Regulations 2008). 
A Regulation on the Mutual Recognition of Freezing and Confiscation Orders has been A.7.34 
proposed to replace and further develop this existing mutual recognition framework (the 
2003 Framework Decision and the Council Framework Decision (2006/783/HA) on the 
application of the principle of mutual recognition to confiscation orders)) The proposed 
Regulation aims to create 'a uniform and more effective legal instrument to improve 
cross-border asset recovery'. 2 It is intended to resolve the issues caused by the implemen-
tation of existing instruments. The draft Regulation covers a wider range of confiscation 
such as non-conviction-based confiscation (including some preventative confiscation). It 
also standardizes procedures to improve efficiency. On 8 December 2017, the Council 
agreed a general approach on the proposal.3 The UK has indicated it wishes to opt in but 
this initiative, like other mutual recognition instruments, will be affected when and if the 
UK withdraws from the EU.

(iv) The Council Framework Decision 2008/978IJHA of 18 December 2008 on the 
European evidence warrant for the purpose of obtaining objects, documents and 
data for use in proceedings in criminal matters 
In late 2008, the Framework Decision on the European Evidence Warrant (EEW) was A.7.35 
finalised. The main purpose of the proposal was to consolidate the disparate schemes and 
to accelerate and simplify the process of gathering and transmitting evidence in criminal 
cases with a cross-border element. A simple form was to be sent between Member States' 
authorities, including an order from the 'issuing state' (the state which sends the form) for 
the 'executing state' to carry out certain activities. The EEW extended the mutual 
recognition principle of the European Arrest Warrant to the transfer of limited types of 
'object kb documents and data' among Member States in criminal proceedings.' However, 
the EEW remained flawed as an effective cross-border instrument. It was only applicable to 
evidence already in existence and therefore restricted the spectrum of judicial cooperation 
in criminal matters with respect to such evidence. Because of its limited scope, competent 
authorities were free to use the new regime or to use co-existing MLA procedures in any 
case applicable to evidence falling outside of the scope of the EEW. The EEW specifically 
excluded 'real time evidence such as the interviewing or taking of statements from 
suspects, witnesses or victims, the interception of communications, the taking of DNA or 
bodily samples, evidence gathered as a result of ongoing monitoring or surveillance, or

evidence that required analysis to be conducted? The EEW took eight years to come into 
being and its difficult history highlights the problems of pursuing prosecution initiatives in 
this area. Even before it could be implemented it was overtaken by a new proposal for a 
Directive on the European Investigation Order (EIO). The EIO has now effectively 
replaced the EEW. 
I The EEW is limited to obtaining those 'object(s), documents and data from another member state that 
are already in existence—Art 1(1). See J.R. Spencer. 'The Probkms of Trans-border Evidence and 
European Initiatives to Resolve Them'. Gnabrielge Yearbook of European Lego! Studies. Vol. 9, Oxford: 
Hart Publishing. 2007, pp 477. 478. 
Article 4(2). 
(v) The European Investigation Order 
A.7.36 As noted, almost as soon after the EEW had been agreed, the EU's Stockholm Programme 
on the Area of Freedom Security and Justice issued a commitment to replace the EEW with 
a proposal for a 'comprehensive instrument for the transfer of all forms of evidence.' The 
Stockholm Programme referred to the existing mutual legal assistance system as 'frag-
mented', complaining that the present arrangements permitted access to only limited 
categories of evidence with a large number of grounds for refusal.2 Asa result, a compre-
hensive mutual recognition initiative has now been produced—the European Investigation 
Order (E1O).3

A.7.37 The EIO Directive provides for a Member State to 'have one or several specific investigative 
measure(s) carried out in another Member State to obtain evidence'. The key elements of 
the Directive include a standardized format for requests; the application of the principle of 
mutual recognition to requests, together with timeframes for responding to requests. It also 
prescribes the grounds for refusal (eg Art 11(1)(f) of the Directive permits a refusal to 
execute an EIO on human rights grounds). Amongst other investigative measures, the 
Directive enables the Executing State to: 
• temporarily transfer persons held in custody for further investigation; 
• summon witnesses to court to provide evidence by video conference at a hearing; 
• transfer evidence already in the possession of the Executing State; and 
• undertake certain covert investigations and intercept telecommunications. 
The Directive does not apply to Schengen cross-border surveillance by police officers under 
the Schengen Convention, or to the setting up of joint investigation teams and the 
gathering of evidence within such a team.

A. Introduction 
(A.7.391 
The EIO replaces the EEW and most other mutual legal assistance measures with a scheme 
applicable to all investigative measures and is intended to be the sole legal instrument 
regulating the exchange of evidence and mutual legal assistance between EU Member 
States. The scheme differs from the old framework in two crucial respects: first, it removes 
some of the key protections attached to substantive provisions; and second, it operates by 
way of mutual recognition.' Member States had until 22 May 2017 to implement the 
Directive into domestic law. The UK opted into the Directive under Protocol 21 of the 
TFEU and transposed it via the Criminal Justice (European Investigation Order) Regula-
tions 20172 with effect from 31 July 2017. (The UK General Election accounted for the 
delay in transposition.) The Explanatory Memorandum to the Regulations explains: 'It 
[the Directive] largely relies on existing law enforcement tools such as search warrants and 
production orders, which broadly aligns with existing procedures under the Crime (Inter-
national Cooperation) Act 2003.'3 It also explains that, where there is currently no need for 
court involvement in domestic cases, ElOs will normally be made or validated by a 
designated public prosecutor (see Part 1 of Schedule 1); there are exceptions to this where 
a request for an Order is made by a defendant or other prosecuting authority who will need 
to make an application to a court. Where a court would normally be involved in a domestic 
case (for instance when issuing a search warrant), only a court will be able to make a 
European investigation order.

(vi) Other mutual recognition initiatives 
Other mutual recognition initiatives have been produced to accelerate mutual legal A.7.39 
assistance within the EU. They include a Framework Decision 2006/783/JHA on confis-
cation orders (noted briefly above at pars A.7.34) which applies the principle of mutual 
recognition to confiscation orders issued by a criminal court for the purpose of facilitating 
their enforcement in other EU Member States.' The Framework Decision follows the usual 
pattern of mutual recognition initiatives and applies to all offences in relation to which 
confiscation orders can be issued. Part 2 of the Criminal Justice and Data Protection 
(Protocol No. 36) Regulations 2014 (SI 2014/3141) as amended by the Criminal Justice 
and Data Protection (Protocol No. 36) (Amendment) Regulations 2014 (SI 2014/3191) 
(the 2014 Regulations) gives effect to this Framework Decision (to the extent that it had 
not already been transposed by the Crime (International Co-operation) Act 2003). As 
noted, the proposed Regulation on the Mutual Recognition of Freezing and Confiscation 
Orders will replace this instrument.

confiscation orders. OJ L 328, 24.11.2006—as amended by Framework Decision 2009/299/JHA in

A. Introduction 
[A.7.471 
(viii) Agreement on Mutual Legal Assistance between the EU and the USA 
On 20 September 2001, in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks in the USA, the EU's A.7.43 
Justice and Home Affairs Council called for the adoption of measures aimed at enhancing 
cooperation in criminal matters including mutual assistance arrangements between the EU 
and the USA. 
The Agreement on Mutual Legal Assistance between the EU and the USA was signed on 25 A.7.44 
June 20031 and entered into force on 1st February 2010.2 It establishes a common 
framework for cooperation alongside existing bilateral agreements between the USA and 
individual Member States. 
OJ L 181. 19.07.2003, p 34. referred min this s as 'the Agreement. Cf the Agreement on Extradition 
between the EU and the USA. OJ 1181. 19.07.2003. p 27. 
<http://ec.europa.eu/wodd/agreementsfprepattCreatare-atiesWorltspace/tre-atiesGeneraIData.do≥step 
=0&redirect=true&treatyld=5441&back=5461>. 
Although initial impetus for the Agreement was the events of 11 September 2001, it goes A.7.45 
further than addressing mutual legal assistance merely in relation in relation to terrorism 
and organized crime.' 
I See. eg. Arc 4(4)(a). 
In summary, the Agreement gives USA law enforcement authorities access to bank A.7.46 
accounts throughout the EU (and vice versa) in the context of investigations into serious 
crimes, including terrorism, organized crime, and financial crime. It is intended to improve 
practical cooperation by reducing delays in mutual legal assistance. It also allows for the 
creation of joint investigative teams and the possibility of videoconferencing. It also 
contains extensive provisions in relation to data protection and the provision of evidence 
and information. 
A recent Agreement between the United States and the European Union on the protection A.7.47 
of personal information relating to the prevention, investigation, detection, and prosecu-
tion of criminal offences' applies privacy protections to data that is exchanged between law 
enforcement agencies in the EU and the USA. Those safeguards include limitations on data 
use, prior consent from EU authorities before any onward transfer of data, a requirement 
to define data retention periods, and citizens' rights to access and correct data held about 
them. The EU—USA umbrella agreement entered into force on 1 February 2017. The data 
protection umbrella agreement is separate from the EU—USA privacy shield that facilitates 
the transfer of personal data from the EU to the USA by businesses.2 Once the UK ceases 
to be a member of the EU, the EU—USA umbrella agreement will not apply to it. 
OJ L 336/3-13, 5.12.2016. In terms of standards within the EU, see the new EU General Data 
Protection Regulation 20161679, OI L 119. 4.5.2016. which comes into force on 25 May 2018.

Chapter A7: Mutual Legal Assistance in Cases of Fraud 
A.7.48 The EU—USA MLA Agreement applies to all offences irrespective of when they were 
committed and, in particular. whether they were committed before or after the Agreement 
entered into force.' The Agreement only applies to requests for assistance made after its 
entry into force. However, Arts 6 and 7 (video conferencing and expedition) apply to 
requests pending in a requested state at the time the Agreement enters into force.2
Article 12(1). 
Ardck 12(2). 
A.7.49 Art 3 provides that the EU and the USA shall ensure that the provisions of the Agreement 
are applied in relation to bilateral mutual legal assistance treaties between the Member 
States and the USA, in force at the time of the entry into force of the Agreement. In 
particular: 
• Art 4 is to be applied to provide for identification of financial accounts and transactions 
in addition to any authority already provided under bilateral treaty provisions; 
• Art 5 is to be applied to authorize the formation and activities ofjoint investigative teams 
in addition to any authority already provided under bilateral treaty provisions; 
• Art 6 is to be applied to authorize the taking of testimony of a person located in the 
requested state by use of video technology, in addition to any authority already provided 
under bilateral treaty provisions; 
• Art 7 shall be applied to provide for the use of expedited means of communication in 
addition to any authority already provided under bilateral treaty provisions; 
• Art 8 shall be applied to authorize the providing of mutual legal assistance to the 
administrative authorities concerned, in addition to any authority already provided 
under bilateral treaty provisions; 
• Art 9 shall, subject to Art 9(4) and (5), be applied in place of, or in the absence of bilateral 
treaty provisions governing limitations on use of information or evidence provided to the 
requesting state, and governing the conditioning or refusal of assistance on data 
protection grounds; 
• Art 10 shall be applied in the absence of bilateral treaty provisions pertaining to the 
circumstances under which a requesting state may seek the confidentiality of its request. 
A.7.50 Under Art 4(a) and (b) a request for assistance may be made to identify whether a person 
identified in the request and suspected of, or charged with, a criminal offence holds bank 
accounts in the requested country's territory; to identify information regarding natural or 
legal persons convicted of or otherwise involved in a criminal offence; to identify informa-
tion in the possession of non-bank financial institutions; or to identify financial transac-
tions unrelated to accounts. 
A.7.51 Despite its title, the scope of information covered in the Agreement is broader than offences 
relating to terrorism and organized crime, and could cover a wide range of information 
about legitimate everyday transactions of innocent third parties.' The term 'otherwise 
involved in a criminal offence' in Art 4 does not specify whether a person must be under 
criminal investigation before information about him can be transmitted. For example, an 
innocent third party who is the victim of money laundering without their knowledge could

there was an actual investigation going on': see the Session 2002-2003. 38th Report of the House of 
Lords Select Committee on the European Union. HL Paper 153. 
Art 5 provides for joint investigative teams from the US and a Member State. These can be A.7.52 
established and operated for the purpose of facilitating criminal investigations or prosecu-
tions involving one or more Member State and the USA. The procedure under which the 
team is to operate, such as its composition, duration, location, organization, functions, 
purpose, and terms of participation, are to be agreed between the competent authorities 
responsible for the investigation or prosecution of criminal offences, as determined by the 
respective states concerned. 
Art 6 of the Agreement requires parties to enable the use of video technology for taking the 
testimony of a witness in proceedings for which mutual legal assistance is available. The 
cost of establishing and servicing the transmission is borne by the requesting state. 
A.7.53 
Although the EU agreements have now entered into force, existing Members States' A.7.54 
procedures will have to be amended to remove any inconsistencies between existing 
domestic legislation and/or bilateral treaties and these new multi-lateral agreements. Post 
Brexit, the UK will have to negotiate such agreements individually. 
(d) UK mutual assistance legislation in outline 
(if Crime (International Co-operation) Act 2003 
Part 1 of CICA 2003 largely replaces the UK's mutual legal assistance legislation, previously

although s 5 and s 6 remain in force. 
A.7.55 
The structure of CICA 2003 is as follows. 
A.7.56 
• Part 1: 'Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters: this part re-enacts the mutual assistance 
provisions of the Criminal Justice (International Co-operation) Act 1990. It also 
implements the mutual legal assistance provisions of the Schengen Convention;' the EU 
Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters 2000;2 and the evidence-freezing 
provisions of the Council Framework Decision 2003/577/JHA of 22 July 2003.3
Chapter 4 of Part 1 also implements the 2001 Protocol to the EU Convention on Mutual 
Assistance in Criminal Matters4 which creates obligations for participating countries to 
respond to requests for assistance with locating banking accounts and to provide banking 
information relating to criminal investigations. 
• Pan 2: 'Terrorist Acts and Threats: Jurisdiction: this part implements the Framework 
Decision on Combating Terrorism, including the provisions relating to extra-territorial

(ii) Proceeds of Crime 2002 (External Requests and Orders) Order 20051
A.7.58 The POCA Order is made under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (POCA). It enables the 
UK to restrain assets at the request of foreign states and also to enforce external confiscation 
orders. It also provides the machinery whereby foreign states can utilize civil restraint 
powers akin to those contained in Part 5 of POCA.2

Orders) Order 2005 (England and Wales) (Appeals under Pt 2) Order 2012, SI 2012/138 makes 
provisions corresponding to provisions (subject to specified modifications) in the Criminal Appeal Act 
1968, which .Sts out the procedure Co be followed for general domestic criminal appeals. 
The absence of any extraterritorial reach in Pt 5 of POCA was considered and affirmed by the Supreme 
Court in Perry v Serious aganiseri Crime Ageney(2013) 1 AC 182. As a result, Pt 2 of Sch 18 to the Crime 
and COWLS Act 2013 amends Chapter 2 of Pt 5 of the POCA by inserting new ss 282B-F into POCA. 
The new provisions facilitate the enforcement outside the UK of orders made under Chapter 2 of Pt 5 
of POCA and the transmission of requests for evidence held outside the UK. These new provisions are 
modelled on existing mutual legal assistance provisions in Chapter 2 of Pt 1 of the Crime (International 
Co-operation) ACE 2003 and s 74 of POCA. 
A.7.59 The POCA Order is considered in detail in pars A.7.613.

A.7.60 The term 'central authority' refers to the government department within a jurisdiction that 
acts as a central point for the transmission of incoming and outgoing requests for mutual 
legal assistance in criminal matters and also the product of those requests.

A. Introduction 
[A.7.63-100) 
Responsibility for mutual assistance in criminal matters in England and Wales lies with the A.7.61 
Secretary of State for the Home Department. His functions under the legislation are in 
practice exercised by the UK Central Authority. The address of the UK Central Authority is:

Email: UKCA-ILOR@homeoffice.gsi.gov.uk 
The UK Central Authority's role in the mutual legal assistance process includes: 
A.7.62 
• ensuring that requests for legal assistance conform with the requirements of law in the 
relevant part of the UK and the UK's international obligations; 
• ensuring that execution of requests is not inappropriate on public policy grounds (for 
example, requests involving double jeopardy will not be executed); 
• deciding how requests might most appropriately be executed (for example, some 
requests asking for search and seizure of evidence may be executed effectively by a witness 
producing the evidence to a court); 
• maintaining confidentiality of requests where necessary; 
• ensuring, so far as possible, that assistance is provided within an appropriate time scale 
(for example, taking account of trial dates); 
• drawing to the attention of the courts, the police, and other UK authorities or agencies 
requests for evidence to be obtained in the presence of foreign law enforcement officers, 
prosecutors, or defence lawyers; 
• seeking requesting authorities agreement to meet extraordinary costs of executing 
requests and for services such as interpreters or stenographers or for duplication of 
documents (ordinarily, the UK authorities, in accordance with established international 
practice will meet costs, with the exception of TV/video link evidence); 
• transmitting evidence received to the requesting authorities when it is not returned 
directly (and checking whether any part of the request remains outstanding). 
The UK Central Authority also publishes the Mutual Legal Assistance Guidelines for the A.7.63-100 
United Kingdom (12th edn, Home Office, March 2015) (the MIA Guidelines)) The 
MLA Guidelines are an essential source of information for anyone wishing to seek mutual 
legal assistance from the UK, and any person in the UK seeking assistance from a foreign 
state.

(i) The National Crime Agency 
Not all mutual cooperation in the investigation of crime requires the involvement of the A.7.110 
UK Central Authority. Although requests which require the UK to provide formal legal 
assistance in the form of search warrants, etc, must in general be sent to the UK Central 
Authority for processing in accordance with the CICA 2003 or other legislation,' where 
more informal investigative assistance is required then the authorities of the foreign state 
may approach the UK directly via Interpol with a request to provide assistance. 
But now the power of HMRC to process requests directly punuant to Crime (International Co-
operation) Act 2003 (Exercise of Functions) Order 2013. SI 2013/2733. 
The Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 (SOCPA) created new law enforcement 
powers and established a new agency, the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) .1
SOCA commenced work on 1 April 2006 and replaced the National Criminal Intelligence 
Service and the National Crime Squad.2 It also took over the investigative work formerly 
undertaken by the Revenue and Customs in so far as it relates to revenue fraud, subject to 
the agreement of the Commissioners for Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs.3

Chapter A7: Mutual Legal Assistance in Cases of Fraud 
I SOCPA, s 1(1). 
SOCPA. s 1(3); NCIS and NCS (Abolition) Order 2006 (SI 2006/540). In April 2008 the Assets 
Recovery Agency was merged with SOCA. See Serious Crime Act 2007, s 74. 
SOCPA. s 2(4). 
A.7.112 SOCA was abolished by Part 1 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013 (ss 1-16) and replaced 
by the National Crime Agency (NCA), under the direction of a director general. 
A.7.113 The NCA (previously SOCA) has an important role to play in mutual assistance matters. 
It is the UK National Central Bureau of Interpol and the UK Liaison Bureau for Europol. 
It has primary responsibility for processing requests for investigative help from overseas. S 
8(3)-8(4) of the Crime and Courts Act 2013 provides that: 
The Director General may provide assistance to-
(a) a government in a country or territory outside the British Islands, or 
(b) another overseas body exercising functions of a public nature in a country or 
territory outside the United Islands 
if the government, or the body, requests assistance to be provided 
If such a request if made, the Director General may provide such assistance as the 
Director General considers appropriate in all the circumstances.' 
I Note. however, s 8(5). which provides that s 8(3) does not apply to any request for assistance which could 
be made under s 13 CICA 2003 (requestsbyoverseasauthorities to obtain evidence). unless the NCA has 
functions under that sin relation to the request by virtue of an order under s 27(2) (general power of 
Secretary of State to delegate his functions to a designated body). 
A.7.114 All formal requests for assistance must be sent to a central authority for consideration. 
However, the MLA Guidelines confirm that this is subject to the following exceptions: 
• EU Freezing Orders for property must be sent to the relevant UK prosecuting authority 
for the purposes of recognition and execution (except 'property related to terrorism 
offences or investigations, which must be sent to a central authority); 
• EU Confiscation Orders must be sent to the relevant UK prosecuting authority for the 
purposes of recognition and execution.' 
I MLA Guidelines, pp 4-5. 
(j) Letters of request and commissions rogatoires 
A.7.115 The terms 'letter of request' and letters rogatory' (or commission rogatoires) both refer to the 
formal document sent from one state to another in order to seek mutual legal assistance. 
Strictly speaking, a commission rogatoires is a document issued by a judicial authority of one 
state to a foreign judicial authority seeking its assistance in a specified manner; however in 
the UK the two terms have acquired a virtually synonymous meaning.' Although the term 
'letters rogatory' is used in Chapter II of the European Convention on Mutual Assistance 
in Criminal Matters 1939,2 later instruments simply refer to a 'request' or 'letter of request'. 
and those are the terms which will be used in this chapter. A Letter of Request is the formal 
written document by which MLA is requested in England and Wales; in French, it is called 
a commission rogatoire, a term widely understood internationally. There is no requirement

B. UK Requests to Foreign States for Assistance 
This s examines the means by which UK prosecuting authorities and criminal defendants A.7.116 
can seek the assistance of foreign authorities in relation to criminal investigations and 
proceedings in the UK.' The majority of the relevant powers are contained in Part 1 of 
CICA 2003. Sections 7 to 9 deal with requests to obtain evidence from abroad in relation 
to a prosecution or investigation taking place in the UK. 
Mutual Legal Assistance can also be of relevance in the context of disclosure in ongoing domestic 
criminal proceedings. As to the namre and extent of the Crown's obligation to initiate MIA procedures 
so as to fulfill its duty. under the CPIA 19% and the Attorney General's Disclosure Guidelines, to 
undertake all reasonable lines of inquiry. see R v Rook 120101 I Cr App R 30. 
(a) Persons able to request assistance 
(0 Requests by a judicial authority on the application of a prosecuting authority 
or the defendant 
Both prosecutors and defendants may apply to a court that it makes a request to a foreign A.7.117 
state for assistance. CICA 2003, s 7(1) provides that if it appears to a judicial authority' in 
the UK on an application made by a person mentioned in s 7(3) that an offence has been 
committed or that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that an offence has been 
committed, and that proceedings in respect of the offence have been instituted or that the 
offence is being investigated, the judicial authority may request assistance under s 7. The 
assistance that may be requested is assistance in obtaining outside the UK any evidence 
specified in the request for use in the proceedings or investigation (s 7(2)). 
CICA 2003,57(4) defines judicial authority. in relation to England and Wales. to be any judge or Justice 
of the Peace (JP). 
S 7(3) provides that the application may be made in relation to England and Wales and A.7.118 
Northern Ireland, by a prosecuting authority,' and, where proceedings have been insti-
tuted, by the person charged in those proceedings.2
In relation to Scotland, by the Lord Advocate or a procurator fiscal (s 7(3)(b)). 
In relation to confidentiality, the UK Central Authority does not disclose letters of request to the 
prosecution. However. the possibility that the foreign authority will do so, or will supply any evidence 
gathered pursuant to the request to the prosecution, cannot be ruled out. Defence letters of request 
should always make clear chat the material sought is confidential to the defence.

Chapter A7: Mutual Legal Assistance in Cases of Fraud 
A.7.119 Prosecuting agencies are also able to make requests for assistance directly to the foreign state 
if they have been designated in an order by the Secretary of State. S 7(5) provides that in 
relation to England and Wales or Northern Ireland, a designated prosecuting authority may 
itself request assistance under s 7 if it appears to the authority that an offence has been 
committed or that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that an offence has been 
committed, and the authority has instituted proceedings in respect of the offence in 
question or it is being investigated. 
A.7.120 The following prosecuting authorities have been designated in the Crime (International 
Co-operation) Act 2003 (Designation of Prosecuting Authorities) Order 20041 for the 
purposes of s 7, and are thus able to make requests for assistance directly to foreign 
authorities: 
The Attorney General for England and Wales; the Attorney General for Northern 
Ireland; the Financial Conduct Authority; the Bank of England; the Prudential 
Regulation Authority; the Director of Public Prosecutions and any Crown Prosecu-
tor; the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland; the Director of the 
Serious Fraud Office and any person designated under s 1(7) of the Criminal Justice 
Act 1987; the Environment Agency; the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and

2001 Protocol' to the EU Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters2
(requests for information on banking transactions) in connection with the investigation of 
an offence, the request must state the grounds on which the person making the request 
considers the evidence specified in it to be relevant for the purposes of the investigation.3
OJ C 326. 21.11.2001. Art 2(1) provides: 'On request by the requesting State, the requested State shall 
provide the particulars of specified bank accounts and ofbanking operations which have been carried our 
during a specified period through one or more accounts specified in the request, including the particulars 
of any sending or recipient account.'

A.7.122 CICA 2003, s 7(2) refers to the request being for 'evidence ... for use in the proceedings or 
investigation'. S 51(1) provides that 'evidence includes 'information in any form and 
articles, and giving evidence includes answering a question or producing any information 
or article'. Thus the request for assistance need not be for admissible evidence.

B. UK Requests to Foreign States for Assistance 
[A.7.126] 
(c) Procedure for obtaining a letter of request from a judicial authority 
The application for a letter of request should be made to the court seized of the matter. A.7.123 
Therefore, once the case has been committed, transferred, or sent to the Crown Court the 
application should be made to that court. 
The application should contain particulars of the offence which it is alleged has been A.7.124 
committed or the grounds upon which it is suspected that an offence has been committed; 
a statement of whether proceedings in respect of the offence have been instituted or the 
offence is being investigated; and particulars of the assistance requested in the form of a 
draft letter of request. The common law duty of candour and disclosure attaching to an 
applicant for a domestic search warrant is not applicable, even in modified form, to an 
authority requesting assistance by way of a letter of request under s 7 (R (Unamengy Group 
Holding Pre Ltd) v Director of the Serious Fmsul Grier 120171 1 WLR 3302). 
There are no general statutory provisions prescribing the contents of a letter of requestO A.7.125 
however, in order to be effective, the letter must be as specific as possible about the 
circumstances of the case and the assistance required. The requested state will almost 
certainly know little about the case save what is contained in the letter of request and it is 
therefore necessary to explain as much about the case as possible and to indicate precisely 
what assistance is required. S 2 of the MLA Guidelines contain detailed guidance on what 
should be included in a letter of request. 
I However. Art 14 of the European Convention on Mutual Assistance provides that every request must 
contain details of: (i) the authority making the request; (ii) the object of and the reason for the request; 
(iii) where possibk. the identity and nationality of the person concerned; (iv) the name and addressofthe 
person to be served; (v) the offence involved and a summary of the facts. The content of some requests 
for specialized assistance are prescribed in CICA 2003. see eg s 43(6). 
(4) Transmission of the request under the Crime (International Co-operation) 
Act 2003, section EP 
CICA 2003, s 8(1) provides that a request for assistance under s 7 may be sent directly to A.7.126 
a court exercising jurisdiction in the place where the evidence is situated or to any authority 
recognized by the government of the country in question as the appropriate authority for 
receiving requests of that kind.2
CICA 2003, s 8 implements Art 6 of the EU Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters. 
This provides that requests for mutual assistance may be transmitted directly between judicial authorities 
of Member States concerned, rather than through central authorities. Art 6(2) allows for transmission via 
central authorities to continue in specific cases. and Art 6(3) allows for the UK and Ireland to continue 
to route requests through a central authority. 
Under the Criminal Justice (International Co-operation) Act 1990 direct transmission was only 
permissible in urgent cases.

Court officer must send a copy of the letter of request to the Secretary of State as soon as 
practicable after the request has been made.

authority it may be sent to the Secretary of State' for forwarding to the court or authority 
mentioned in s 8(1). Indirect transmission via the Secretary of State2 under s 8(2) is 
necessary if the requested country is not a Member State, if the executing authority is 
unknown, or if Art 6(8) of the EU Convention on Mutual Assistance requires transmission 
via the central authority, Art 6(8) requires that certain types of request for assistance, 
including requests for the temporary transfer of prisoners and notices of information from 
judicial records,4 be made through Members States' central authorities.

in cases of urgency, a request for assistance may be sent to the International Criminal Police 
Organisation (Interpol),I or any body or person competent to receive it under any 
provisions adopted under the Treaty on European Union, for forwarding to any court or 
authority mentioned ins 8(1).2

(e) Execution of the request and transmission of the evidence to the UK 
A.7.130 Once the letter has been transmitted, responsibility for its execution lies with the relevant 
authorities in the requested state.' Mutual legal assistance treaties place obligations on 
signatories to comply with requests for assistance. Art 1 of the European Convention on 
Mutual Assistance requires signatories to provide 'the widest measure of mutual assistance', 
and Art 3 requires signatories to execute any letter of request 'in the manner provided for 
by its law'.2
I See generally R v! [2008) EWCA Crim 3062. 
Pam 5(1) of the Harare Scheme provides that the requested country shall take all reasonable steps to 
ensure that the request is complied with expeditiously✓. 
A.7.131 Mutual assistance treaties generally provide discretionary grounds for refusing to provide 
assistance. For example, Art 2 of the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in 
Criminal Matters permits a requested state to refuse assistance if the request concerns an 
offence which it considers to be a political offence, an offence connected with a political

Where assistance is refused then mutual assistance treaties generally require reasons to be A.7.132

that if the request cannot, or cannot fully, be executed in accordance with the requirements 
set by the requesting Member State, the authorities of the requested Member State must 
inform the requesting Member State and indicate the conditions under which it might be 
possible to execute the request.

(f) Permitted use, admissibility, and return of the evidence 
(0 Restrictions on collateral use 
CICA 2003, s 9, applies to evidence obtained pursuant to a request for assistance under s A.7.133 
7. S 9(2) limits the use to which the evidence can be put in the UK. The evidence may not, 
without the consent of the `appropriate overseas authority', be used for any purpose other 
than that specified in the request.' The appropriate overseas authority means the authority 
recognized by the government of the country in question as the appropriate authority for 
receiving requests of the kind in question (s 9(6)). 
This rule is analogous co the specialty rule in extradition law.. For a discussion of the relevant principles 
see R v 1[2008] EWCA Crim 3062. See also XYZ v Revenue and Customs Comm [20101 EWHC 1645 
(Ch). Agana( v HMRC[2011) STC 1000. and Crown Prosecution Service v G011;1120131 NM 276. 
The effect of this provision is to render inadmissible in evidence material obtained under s 
in any criminal investigations or proceedings other than those materials explicitly 
specified in the letter of request.' S 9 also renders evidence so obtained inadmissible in civil 
proceedings.2 The prohibition on onward use also includes onward disclosure.3 The 
prohibition continues notwithstanding that evidence is adduced in open court in the 
United Kingdom? However, once the materials are adduced in open court, s 9 does permit 
the information so adduced to be used by others as a springboard for conducting 
independent enquiries with a view to obtaining evidence.5
I Gooch [1999] 1 Cr App R (S) 283. It is not, however. necessary for evidence to be obtained pursuant ro

(ii) Admissibility 
A.7.135 The fact that evidence has been obtained pursuant to a request under CICA 2003, s 7 does 
not per se render it automatically admissible at that trial; the normal rules of evidence 
continue to apply. Therefore, hearsay evidence will be inadmissible unless one of the 
common law exceptions to the hearsay rule is applicable' or the hearsay provisions in the 
Criminal Justice Act 2003 apply.2 S 117 of the 2003 Act governs the admissibility of 
statements made in business documents. If a statement was obtained pursuant to a request 
for assistance under s 7 of CICA 2003 (or, inter alia, under Pan 2 of the Criminal Justice 
(European Investigation Order) Regulations 2017) then by virtue of s 117(4)(3) the 
conditions ins 117(5) do not need to be satisfied.

See Chapter C.2. 
(iii) Return of evidence to the requested state 
A.7.136 When the evidence is no longer required for that purposespecified in the request (or for any 
other purpose for which such consent has been obtained), it must be returned to the 
appropriate overseas authority, unless that authority indicates that it need not be returned 
(s 9(3)).t

(g) Hearing witnesses abroad by television link 
A.7.137 An alternative to requiring a witness to travel from abroad is the use of television links.' 
Outgoing requests from the UK are currently covered by the provisions contained in s 32 
of the Criminal Justice Act 1988, which allow the use of video links in UK domestic 
proceedings in limited circumstances. S 32(1)(a) provides that, with the leave of the court, 
a person other than the accused may give evidence through a live television link in 
proceedings to which s 32(1A) applies if the witness is outside the UK. Telephone evidence 
is not permissible.2 These proceedings are trials on indictment; appeals to the Court of 
Appeal (Criminal Division); hearings of references under s 9 of the Criminal Appeal Act 
1995; proceedings in youth courts; appeals to the Crown Court arising out of such 
proceedings; hearings of references under s 11 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1995 so arising 
and, from 22 July 2013, proceedings under the Extradition Act 2003.

A.7.142 Sched 4 to CICA 2003 contains amendments to Sched 4 to the Terrorism Act 2000 which 
provide for mutual recognition of freezing orders in relation to terrorist property which 
gives further effect to Council Framework Decision 2003/577/JHA of 22 July 2003 in 
respect of terrorist investigations.' 
I See generally above at pan A.7.31. 
(i) Conditions for issuing a domestic freezing order 
A.7.143 Under s 10(2), a domestic freezing order is an order for protecting evidence which is in the 
participating country pending its transfer to the United Kingdom. If it appears to a judicial 
authority in the UK,' on an application made by a person mentioned in CICA 2003, s 
10(4), that proceedings in respect of a listed offence2 have been instituted or such an 
offence is being investigated; that there are reasonable grounds to believe that there is 
evidence in a participating country which satisfies the requirements of s 10(3); and that a 
request has been made, or will be made, under s 7 for the evidence to be sent to the 
authority making the request, the judicial authority may make a domestic freezing order in 
respect of the evidence. 
The judicial authorities are. in relation to England and Wales, any judge or JP: in relation to Scotland. 
any judge of the High Court or sheriff. in relation to Northern Ireland. any judge or resident magistrate 
(s 10(5)). 
A listed offence means an offence described in Art 3(2) of the Freezing Framework Decision. or an 
offence prescribed or of a description prescribed by an order made by the Secretary of State (s 28(5)). 
A.7.144 S 10(4) provides that the application may be made in relation to England and Wales and 
Northern Ireland, by a constable,' and in relation to Scotland, by the Lord Advocate or a 
procurator fiscal. 
CICA 2003. s 27(1)(b) provides that theTreasury may make an order in relation to England and Wales 
and Nonhem Ireland for any function conferred on a constable under various provisions including s 10 
to be exercisable instead in prescribed circumstances by an officer of Revenue and Customs or a person 
acting under his direction. The Crime (International Co-operation) Act 2003 (Exercise of Functions) 
Order 2013. SI 201312733 has been made under s 27. 
A.7.145 The requirements of s 10(3) are that the evidence is on premises specified in the application 
in the participating country; that it is likely to be of substantial value (whether by itself or 
together with other evidence) to the proceedings or investigation; that it is likely to be 
admissible in evidence at a trial for the offence; and that it does not consist of or include 
items subject to legal privilege. 
A.7.146 S 10 does not prejudice the generality of the power to make a request for assistance under 
s 7 (s 10(6)).

(ii) Transmission of the domestic freezing order 
CICA 2003, s II is headed `Sending freezing orders. A domestic freezing order made in A.7.147 
England and Wales or Northern Ireland must be sent by the judicial authority which made 
it within 14 days+ to the Secretary of State2 for forwarding to a court exercising jurisdiction 
in the place where the evidence is situated, or any authority recognized by the government 
of the country in question as the appropriate authority for receiving orders of that kind 
(s 11(1)). 
I CICA 2003. s 11(3). 
In Scotland. the order must be sent to the Lord Advocate (s 10(2)). 
The order must be accompanied by a certificate giving the specified information and. A.7.148-200 
unless the certificate indicates when the judicial authority expects such a request to be 
made, by a request under s 7 for the evidence to be sent to the authority making the request 
(s 11(4)). 
28(7) defines `specified information to be any information required to be given by the A.7.201 
form of certificate annexed to the relevant Framework Decision, or any information 
prescribed by an order made by the Secretary of State. The Annex to the Council 
Framework Decision specifies a standard form for the certificate. It includes details of the 
judicial authority issuing the freezing order, the transmitting central authority and the 
executing authority; a precise description of the location of the evidence; details of 
the person suspected of having committed the offence; the action to be taken by the 
executing state after the freezing order has been executed; a summary of the grounds for 
issuing the order and the facts; and identification of the category which the offence falls 
into and a statement that is punishable by custodial sentence for at least three years. 
The certificate must include a translation of it into an appropriate language of the A.7.202 
participating country (if that language is not English) (s 11(5)). The certificate must be 
signed by or on behalf of the judicial authority who made the order and must include a 
statement as to the accuracy of the information given in it (s 11(6)). The signature may be 
an electronic signature. 
(iii) Amending or revoking a freezing order 
S 12 provides that the judicial authority that made a domestic freezing order may vary or A.7.203 
revoke it on an application by the person who applied for the order; in relation to England 
and Wales and Northern Ireland, a prosecuting authority; in relation to Scotland, the Lord 
Advocate; and any other person affected by the order.

(i) Requests for foreign bank informations 
A.7.204 Chapter 4 of Part 1 of CICA 2003 deals with disclosure of banking information in 
connection with criminal investigations. It implements the 2001 Protocol to the EU 
Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters.2 Requests for bank transaction 
information can generally relate to one of two things: (i) foreign bank account information, 
or (ii) the monitoring of banking transactions. This section examines how, and when, 
requests for overseas banking information can be made by the UK to foreign countries. 
I There are separate powers available to the Director General of the NCA under POCA in relation to 
confiscation investigations.

(1) Requests for information about a person's bank account (Crime (International 
Co-operation)Act 2003, section 43) 
A.7.205 CICA 2003, s 43 sets out the circumstances in which a request for information about an 
individual's bank account can be made to a foreign state. 
A.7.206 S 43(1) provides that if it appears to a judicial authority' in the UK, on an application made 
by a prosecuting authority, that a person is subject to an investigation in the UK into 
serious criminal conduct;2 that the person holds, or may hold, an account at a bank which 
is situated in a participating country;3 and the information which the applicant seeks to 
obtain is likely to be of substantial value for the purposes of the investigation, the judicial 
authority may request assistance under this section. 
I The judicial authorities are. in relation to England and Wales, any judge or JP; in relation to Scotland, 
any sheriff; in relation to Nonhem Ireland, any judge or resident magistrate (s 43(2)). 
'Serious criminal conduct' is defined by CICA 2003. s 46(3) to be conduct which constitutes an offence 
to which Art 1(3) of the 2001 Protocol applies. or an offence specified in an order made by the Secretary 
of State. or, in relation to Scotland. the Scottish Ministers for the purpose of giving effect to any decision 
of the Council of the European Union under Art 1(6). 
For the meaning of 'participating country' see CICA 2003, s 51(2). 
A.7.207 If it appears to a prosecuting authority mentioned in s 43(4) that the conditions in s 
43(1)(2) to (c) are met, the authority may itself request assistance under s 43. The 
prosecuting authorities mentioned in s 43(4) are in relation to England and Wales and 
Northern Ireland, a prosecuting authority designated by an order made by the Secretary of 
State, and in relation to Scotland, the Lord Advocate or a procurator fiscal. 
A.7.208 The assistance that may be requested under s 43 is any assistance in obtaining from a 
participating country one or more of the following (s 43(5)): 
• information as to whether the person in question holds any accounts at any banks 
situated in the participating country; 
• details of any such accounts; 
• details of transactions carried out in any period specified in the request in respect of any 
such accounts.

B. UK Requests to Foreign States for Assistance 
[A.7.215] 
S 43(6) provides that a request for assistance under s 43 must state the grounds on which A.7.209 
the authority making the request thinks that the person in question may hold any account 
at a bank which is situated in a participating country and (if possible) specify the bank or 
banks in question; state the grounds on which the authority making the request considers 
that the information sought to be obtained is likely to be of substantial value for the 
purposes of the investigation, and include any information which may facilitate compli-
ance with the request. 
For the purposes of s 43, a person holds an account if the account is in his name or is held A.7.210 
for his benefit, or he has a power of attorney in respect of the account (s 43(7)). 
(ii) Monitoring banking transactions (Crime (International Co-operation) 
Act 2003, section 44) 
CICA 2003, s 44 governs requests for the monitoring of banking transactions. It imple- A.7.211 
ments Art 3 of the 2001 Protocol for the purpose of outgoing requests from the UK to 
other participating countries to monitor transactions conducted on a specified account or 
accounts. 
S 44(1) provides that if it appears to a judicial authority' in the UK on an application made A.7.212 
by a prosecuting authority, that the information which the applicant seeks to obtain is 
relevant to an investigation in the UK into criminal conduct, the judicial authority may 
request assistance (CICA 2003, s 44). 
I The judicial authorities are, in relation to England and Wales. any judge or JP; in relation to Scotland, 
any sheriff; in relation to Northern Ireland, any judge or resident magistrate (CICA 2003, s 44(2)). 
S 44(3) and s 44(4) are identical to s 43(3) and s 43(4) and permit designated prosecuting A.7.213 
authorities to make requests for assistance directly. 
The assistance that may be requested under s 44 is any assistance in obtaining from a A.7.214 
participating country details of transactions to be carried out in any period specified in the 
request in respect of any accounts at banks situated in that country. 
(iii) Sending requests under the Crime (International Co-operation) Act 2003, 
sections 43 and 44 
Requests for assistance under CICA 2003, ss 43 or 441 are to be sent to the Secretary of A.7.215 
State for forwarding to a court specified in the request and exercising jurisdiction in the 
place where the information is to be obtained, or to any authority recognized by the 
participating country in question as the appropriate authority for receiving requests for 
assistance of the kind to which this s applies (s 45(1)). In cases of urgency the request may 
be sent directly to the court (s 45(2)).

Chapter A7: Mutual Legal Assistance in Cases of Fraud 
C. Requests by Foreign States to the UK for Assistance 
in Providing Evidence 
(a) Introduction 
A.7.216 This section considers the relevant principles where the assistance requested from the UK 
involves the provision of evidence and information, including banking information. 
Provisions relating to restraint, confiscation, and forfeiture are considered later in this 
chapter.' 
I See pars A.7.612. 
(b) Requests from foreign states for assistance in obtaining evidence 
A.7.217 This section examines the methods by which the UK grams assistance in obtaining 
evidence for use in criminal proceedings or investigations abroad.' The scheme for 
compelling evidence for use outside the jurisdiction is exclusively statutory under CICA 
2003. Therefore, where Norwich Pharmatal proceedings were brought to obtain evidence 
(as distinct from information) for use overseas in criminal proceedings, it was held ire I? 
(Omar) v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Afinin3 that the UK courts have 
no jurisdiction to order the provision of such evidence. The CICA 2003 regime accords 
ministerial discretion, the confinement of requests to foreign courts and prosecuting 
authorities, national security.' and Crown servant exemptions a paramountcy which the 
common law remedy does not. The differences are so substantial that Parliament could not 
have intended that the common law remedy should survive the introduction of CICA 
2003. Had Norwich PharmaraI proceedings been permissible in principle, s 13(2) CICA 
2003 would have required either the foreign prosecutor or the court to make an application 
to the UK. No request having been made to the foreign court, no foreign court had asked 
the UK to assist. It is an integral part of the CICA 2003 statutory scheme that assistance is 
sought by the requesting courts To permit the proceedings to proceed without a request 
from a foreign court would evade this principal requirement of the CICA 2003 statutory 
regime. In deciding whether to make a request to the UK, the foreign court would have to 
consider the submissions of the foreign government as a party to its proceedings; which 
process should not be circumvented. In any event, the Court also held that it would not be 
in the interests of comity to entertain the application when a deliberate decision had been 
made not to make an application in the foreign court and the fairness of the foreign court 
had not been called into question. 
The UK can also provide assistance in relation to administrative and clemency proceedings, which are 
defined in CICA 2003. s 51(1). These are not covered in this chapter.

C. Requests by Foreign States to the UK 
[A.7.222] 
The principal provisions are contained in Chapter 2 of Part 1 of CICA 2003. Processing A.7.218 
such a request for assistance under CICA1 involves essentially three stages: 
• assessment of the request and determination of the most appropriate method of giving 
effect to it; 
• execution of the request; 
• transmission of the evidence. 
I It should be noted that there exists legal authority for intelligence sharing outside the CICA regime in s 
1(5) of the Crime and Courts Act 2013 (previously s 3 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 
2005 and previously s 2 of the Police Act 1997). Therefore. the voluntary provision of intelligence to 
foreign law enforcement agencies does not offend CICA, nor the Human Rights Act, even whew that 
information is subsequently used to seek extradition from the United Kingdom: H v LoniAtivoraw 2011 
SCL 978. 
(i) Incoming requests fir assistance: initial steps 
CICA 2003,s 13 provides that where a request for assistance in obtaining evidence in a part A.7.219 
of the UK is received by the 'territorial authority' for that part of the UK, the authority may: 
• if the conditions ins 14 are met, arrange for the evidence to be obtained under s 15, or 
• direct that a search warrant be applied for under or by virtue of ss 16 or 17.1
I Or, in relation to evidence in Scotland, s 18. 
S 28(9) defines the 'territorial authority' in relation to evidence in England and Wales or A.7.220 
Northern Ireland as the Secretary of State, and in relation to Scotland as being the Lord 
Advocate.' 
I Although the EU Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters allows for direct transmission 
of requests (see Art 6(3)) the Explanatory Notes to CICA 2003. pan 53. explain why the UK decided to 
opt out of direct transmission for incoming requests: 'Direct transmission is difficult to apply in our 
domestic system where jurisdiction is based largely on function rather than geography, and where the 
same authorities are not necessarily competent to both issue and execute letters of request. Misdirection 
of requests sent directly to the wrong authority would create delays, defeating the purpose of direct 
transmission which is to speed up the process.' 
S 27(1)(a) states that the Treasury may by order provide, in relation to England and Wales A.7.221 
or Northern Ireland, that the territorial authority's functions under various sections of 
CICA 2003, including ss 13-15, are to be exercisable instead in prescribed circumstances 
by the Commissioners of Customs and Excise. In exercise of this power the Treasury has 
made the Crime (International Co-operation) Act 2003 (Exercise of Functions) Order 
2013.1
I SI 2013/2733. 
(I) The overseas authorities which may request assistance 
S 13(2) provides that the request for assistance may be made only by a court exercising A.7.222 
criminal jurisdiction, or a prosecuting authority, in a country outside the UK; any other 
authority in such a country which appears to the territorial authority to have the function 
of making such requests for assistance;' or any international authority mentioned in s

13(3), namely, the International Criminal Police Organisation (Interpol) or any other body 
or person competent to make a request of the kind to which this s applies under any 
provisions adopted under the Treaty on European Union (ie Eurojust).2 For the purposes of 
s 13(2)(a), a 'prosecuting authority' does not mean a prosecuting authority with the 
requisite authority to transmit a request for assistance. An entity either is or is not a 
'prosecuting authority'. If it is, it does not cease to be a 'prosecuting authority' because of a 
challenge (successful or otherwise) to its competence in issuing any particular request for 
assistance. A prosecutor which lacked authority under the law of the requesting state to 
issue the letter or request remained a prosecuting authority for the purposes of s 13(2) 
CICA 2003.3 However, as discussed below! 'obvious unlawfulness under the law of the 
requesting state remains a matter relevant to the exercise of the Secretary of State's 
discretion.

(2) The derision whether or not to grant assistance: general 
A.7.223 In all cases the territorial authority must be satisfied that the request for assistance can 
properly be described as a request for obtaining 'evidence' and thus that it falls within CICA 
2003, s 13(1). However having regard to the broad definition of evidence in s 51(1) it is 
unlikely that a request for assistance will fail for this reason.' The Secretary of State must, 
however, satisfy himself that a request is not ambiguous or lacking in precision?

A.7.224 The territorial authority must then determine whether the statutory conditions in CICA 
2003 for the grant of assistance are satisfied. If they are, the authority must then decide 
whether it is appropriate for the UK to grant assistance. The territorial authority has a 
discretion whether to grant assistance. In exercising this discretion the territorial authority 
must take into account any relevant treaty grounds for refusing assistance.' A decision 
whether or not to grant assistance is amenable to judicial review.2

C. Requests by Foreign States to the UK 
[A.7.225] 
thus the fact that statutory conditions for the grant of assistance are satisfied does not A.7.225 
necessarily compel the territorial authority to grant assistance. The grant of assistance is an 
exercise of the power of the State. The UK executing authority has a discretion whether to 
grant assistance.' There may be rare cases where it is not appropriate to do so.2 The ambit 
of the discretion is, however, informed by the policy of mutual assistance underlying CICA 
2003, together with the reality of what the Secretary of State is equipped and resourced to 
do.3 As the High Court has observed, the process is not a trial; it leads only to the 
transmission of evidence to the requesting state where, if it is to be used, one can assume 
that the criminal defendant will have the opportunity of answering it. Secondly, such 
requests are made by friendly, foreign countries with which the UK has treaty or similar 
obligations of mutual cooperation. The expectation is therefore that the UK will comply 
with the request unless there are 'compelling reasons' for not doing so and will do so as 
quickly as possible. Any requirement of procedural fairness must be fashioned with those 
considerations firmly in mind.4 The mere fact that evidence obtained under a letter of 
request would be made available to third parties in the requesting state is not of itself a 
compelling reasons Neither is mere delay, proportionality, or asserted futility.6 Relevant 
'compelling reasons do include,' but are however not limited to those instances enumer-
ated in the applicable Convention.8 Other considerations include whether the requesting 
state has acted in good faith in the interests of justice" and whether there are particular 
factors making assistance inappropriate, for example, if a person affected by the request has 
already been tried for the alleged olfence.70 It would also generally be wrong for the 
Secretary of State to exercise the discretion in favour of answering a request when it was 
'obviously unlawful' in the sense that it was undisputed or incapable of being properly 
disputed that the request was made unlawfully according to the law of the requesting state. 
It will however only be possible to establish this where there exists no, or no room for 
proper, dispute as to the unlawfulness in question on the evidence. Otherwise, it is not the 
function of the Secretary of State to determine genuine and live rival contentions of foreign 
law."

Government of Pakistan had lied in the letter of request. Latham I held that although the court had no 
jurisdiction to decline to give effect to the request on the grounds of abuse of process, this was material 
which the Secretary of State should take into account before making a nomination. Further, if the

A.7.226 In taking the decision whether to grant assistance the territorial authority is under a duty to 
act lawfully, rationally, and in a procedurally fair way. In particular, the territorial authority 
is a public authority for the purposes of s 6(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998 and so must 
act compatibly with the Convention rights of any person likely to be affected by the grant 
of assistance. A grant of assistance may, for example, involve the infringement of a person's 
privacy rights under Art 8(1)1 and so need to be justified under Art 8(2). It may also raise 
issues about the fairness of any trial in the requesting state, in cases of past or prospective 
flagrant denial of justice.2 Accordingly, the territorial authority is required to assess the 
circumstances of each request to ensure that the measures it authorizes are both necessary 
and proportionate. However, ordinarily and a fortiori where the requesting country is party 
to the ECHR, any Art 6 or Art 8 concerns are best left for resolution in the courts of the 
requesting state.3 In Ismail v Secretary of State fir the Home Department! the Supreme 
Court considered the extent of the Secretary of State's discretion when serving a foreign 
judgment under the Crime (International Co-operation) Act 2003, s 1. It concluded that 
service of a judgment was not the same as enforcement of it. The Supreme Court held that, 
in circumstances where service would not have a direct and material impact on the 
recipient, the Secretary of State was not under an obligation to investigate any conse-
quences of it. However, the court also noted that there may be cases where service of a 
judgment would engage Art 6 ECHR, necessitating further investigation.

(3) Disclosure of the letter of request 
The UK Central Authority treats letters of request confidentially in accordance with A.7.229 
relevant treaty provisions and general international practice.' The UK Central Authority 
will not disclose the existence or content of letters of request outside government depart-
ments or agencies or the courts or enforcement agencies in the UK. Requests are not shown 
or copied to any witness or other person, nor is any witness informed of the identity of any 
other witness. In the event that confidentiality requirements make execution of a request 
difficult or impossible, the UK Central Authority consults the requesting authorities. It will 
normally be the case that the requesting authority will be given the opportunity to 
withdraw the request before disclosure to third parties is made. 2
I See, eg, pan 32 of the Commonwealth Scheme. Art 7 of the Treaty between the Government of Great 
Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the United States of America on Mutual Legal 
Assistance in Criminal Mallets 1994 is headed 'Confidentiality and Limitations on Use and begins: 
'The requested patty shall. upon request. keep confidential any information which might indicate that 
a request has been made or responded to. If the request cannot be executed without breaching 
confidentiality, the requested party shall so inform the requesting party which shall then determine the 
extent to which it wishes the request to be executed.' 
MLA Guidelines. p G. 
The wishes of the requesting state cannot be relied upon to keep a request confidential if to A.7.23O 
do so would result in unfairness. The fact that the requestingstate may have an expectation 
that the request will be kept confidential cannot outweigh the territorial authority's duty to 
act fairly) The courts have found that the starting point is that letters of request are 
confidential and, as a matter of principle, are not disclosed to the court or to a party 
affected, but that the principles of fairness might require information about the nature of 
the criminal investigation be provided.2 Thus, a person affected by a letter of request may 
be entitled to know the gist of the letter in order that he can take advice as to whether to 
comply with any process resulting from it)

A.7.232 CICA 2003, s 15 allows a nominated court to take the evidence of a witness on oath. By 
s 14(1), the territorial authority may arrange for the evidence to be taken under s 15 if the 
request for assistance in obtaining evidence received under s 13 is made inter alia in 
connection with criminal proceedings and criminal investigations being carried on outside 
the UK. 
A.7.233 In respect of requests falling within s 14(1)(a) the territorial authority may only arrange for 
the evidence to be obtained where it is satisfied that an offence' under the law of the 
country has been committed, or that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that such 
an offence has been committed, and that proceedings in respect of the offence has been 
instituted in that country, or that an investigation into the offence is being carried on there 
(s 14(2)). In respect of these matters the territorial authority is to regard a certificate issued 
by the appropriate authority in the country as conclusive (s 14(3)).2 
An offence includes an 2C1 punishable in administrative proceedings. 
Cf R (Aback) v Serremry of State fir the Home Department 120011 EWHC Admin 787. pan 23. 
A.7.234 S 14(4) contains an additional requirement where the request appears to relate to a fiscal 
offence.' A fiscal offence is one connected with taxes, duties, customs, or exchange.2 S 
14(4) provides that if it appears to the territorial authority that the request for assistance 
relates to a fiscal offence in respect of which proceedings have not yet been instituted, the 
authority may not arrange for the evidence to be obtained under s 15 unless the request is 
from a country which is a member of the Commonwealth, or is made pursuant to a treaty 
to which the UK is a party. or the authority is satisfied that if the conduct constituting the 
offence were to occur in a part of the UK, it would constitute an offence in that part.3 
I An 2(a) of the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters permits assistance to be 
refused if the request relates to a fiscal offence. Article I of the Additional Protocol provides that 
signatories would not exercise the right provided for in Art 2(a) to refuse assistance solely on the ground 
char the request concerns an offence which the requested Parry considers a fiscal offence. The UK ratified 
the Additional Protocol in 1991.

C. Requests by Foreign States to the UK 
[A.7.239] 
(2) The hearing 
If the territorial authority nominates a court under s 15 a notice of nomination is sent to the A.7.235 
court.' Schedule 1 to CICA 2003 is headed 'Proceedings of a Nominated Court under s 15' 
and contains detailed provisions concerning these proceedings. 
By convention, the court nominated is that at which the Chief Magistrate sirs. Until 2011. that was the 
'City of Westminster' magistrates court in Horseferry Road. Following its closure, the Chief Magistrates' 
court is now the 'Westminster magistrates court in Marylebone Road. The court's address is 181 
Marylebone Road, London WI 5BR: tel: 020 3126 3010; fa: 020 3126 3011. 
Para 1 of Schedule 1 provides that the nominated court shall have the like powers for A.7.236 
securing the attendance of a witness for the purpose of the proceedings as it has for the 
purpose of other proceedings before it. The court can therefore issue a witness summons to 
secure the witnesses attendance in precisely the same manner as in domestic matters.' 
Domestic powers include Magistrates Courts Act 1980.5 97 (magistrates' courts); Criminal Procedure 
(Attendance of Witnesses) Act 1965 s 2, (Crown Court). 
Para 3 of Schedule 1 empowers the court to administer oaths in the normal manner. 
A.7.237 
The procedure is governed by Part 49 of the Criminal Procedure Rules 2015.' Rule 49.4 A.7.238 
provides that a court nominated under s 15(1) may determine who may appear or take part 
in the proceedings under Schedule 1 before the court and whether a party to the 
proceedings is entitled to be legally represented; and may direct that the public be excluded 
from those proceedings if it thinks it necessary to do so in the interests of justice. Generally, 
the requesting state and the witness are entitled to be represented, and, if he has notice of 
the nomination, the defendant in the foreign proceedings may also be represented. The 
provisions of ss13-15 have been held to be compatible with the Human Rights Act 1998. 
In particular, the ability of the UK court to withhold notification of the process from the 
suspect in the interests of an ongoing investigation does not offend Art 8 of the European 
Convention on Human Rights.2

Rule 49.5 provides that where a court is nominated under s 15(1) the justices' clerk or A.7.239 
Crown Court officer shall enter in an overseas record details of the request in respect of 
which the notice under s 15(1) was given; the date on which, and place at which, the 
proceedings under Schedule 1 took place; the name of any witness who gave evidence at the 
proceedings in question; the name of any person who took part in the proceedings as a legal 
representative or an interpreter, whether a witness was required to give evidence on oath or 
(by virtue of s 5 of the Oaths Act 1978) after making a solemn affirmation; and whether the 
opportunity to cross-examine any witness was refused. As to the keeping of an overseas 
record, see rule 49.9.

Chapter A7: Mutual Legal Assistance in Cases of Fraud 
A.7.240 The nominated court's task under s 15(1) is 'to receive any evidence to which the request 
relates which appears to the court to be appropriate for the purpose of giving effect to the 
request') This may entitle the court to receive evidence beyond the scope of that sought in 
the request if it is necessary to do so fully to give effect to it.2 Because its jurisdiction and 
function are prescribed by statute, the court has no jurisdiction to inquire into whether the 
proceedings are an abuse of process, for example, because the requested state has acted in 
bad faith.3 A court nominated under s 15 must, when considering evidence, have regard to 
the rights conferred by Art8(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights. It is for the 
nominated court to decide upon the appropriate procedure where a decision has to be 
made as to whether an interference with the right under Art 8(1) is justified under Art 8(2). 
In so doing the court must consider whether to give notice of the application to and to hear 
submissions from any person whose Article 8 rights will be or may be infringed by giving 
effect to the application.4

criminal proceedings in the country from which the request for the evidence has come

questioned to be exempt from giving the evidence is conceded by the court or authority 
which made the request. Where the person's claim is not conceded, he may be required to 
give the evidence to which the claim relates (subject to the other provisions of this pan);

but the evidence may not be forwarded to the court or authority which requested it if a 
court in the country in question, on the matter being referred to it, upholds the claim 
(pan 5(3)). 
Thus pan 5 of Sch 1 applies the domestic rules regarding compellability of witnesses and A.7.245 
the privilege against self-incrimination to proceedings before the nominated court under s 
15(1). Pan 5(0(a) makes clear that in considering whether the privilege applies, the court 
must transpose the foreign proceedings to the UK and consider the question of whether, if 
the foreign proceedings were English domestic criminal proceedings, and the foreign 
offence an English domestic offence, the witness would be entitled to refuse to answer.' 
Pan 5(1)(b) also allows a witness to claim the benefit of any equivalent rules in the 
requesting state to give evidence?

be compelled to give evidence but that the evidence will not be transmitted if the claim to 
be exempt is upheld by the foreign court, tribunal, or authority upon the matter being 
referred to it. 
Witnesses and those required to attend to produce documents in proceedings before a A.7.247 
nominated court are entitled to rely on their common law privilege against self-
incrimination.' This privilege permits a witness in criminal proceedings to refuse to answer 
questions which might tend to incriminate him or her by exposing him to proceedings for 
a criminal offence, for forfeiture, or for the recovery of a penalty.2 The judge must be 
satisfied from the circumstances that there is reasonable ground to apprehend danger to the 
witness from his being compelled to answer.3 If objection is overruled and the witness gives 
evidence, the accused cannot afterwards object.4

(iii) Referring a request to the Serious Fraud Office under the Crime (International 
Co-operation) Act 2003, section 15(2) 
A.7.302 CICA 2003,s 15(2) permits the Secretary of State to refer a letter of request to the Director 
of the SFO' as an alternative to nominating a court under s 15(1) where the offence to 
which the request relates appears to the Secretary of State to be an offence involving serious 
or complex fraud and the conditions in s 14(2)(a) and (b) are satisfied? It is then for the 
Director (provided he accepts the case) to obtain any evidence to which the request relates 
which appears to him to be appropriate for the purpose of giving effect to the request. 
I For Scotland, see s 15(3). 
Also, the condition ins 14(4). if the offence appears to be a fiscal offence. 
A.7.303 The phrase `serious or complex fraud' is not defined in either CICA 2003 or the Criminal 
Justice Act 1987. Whether or not a fraud is serious is a question of fact. In deciding what 
cases to adopt, the SFO has stated that: 'the Director will take into account all the 
circumstances of the case and consider: whether the apparent criminality undermines UK 
Plc commercial or financial interests in general and in the City of London in particular; 
whether the actual or potential financial loss involved is high; whether actual or potential 
economic harm is significant; whether there is a significant public interest element; and 
whether there is new species of fraud'.' 
I See <ImpsdAvww.sio.gov.ukJpublicationsiguidance-policy-and-protocols>. 
A.7.304 Where a case has been referred to the Director of the SFO under s 15(2) he may use his 
investigatory powers under s 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1987. S 2(1) of that Act provides 
that the powers of the Director under s 2 shall be exercisable but only for the purposes of 
an investigation under s 1 or, on a request made by an authority entitled to make such a 
request, in any case in which it appears to him that there is good reason to do so for the 
purpose of investigating the affairs, or any aspect of the affairs, of any person. By s 2(1A)(b), 
the Secretary of State acting under s 15(2) of CICA 2003 is an authority entitled to make 
such a request.

C. Requests by Foreign States to the UK 
[A.7.307] 
Ir a request is sent to the Director under s 15(2) by the Secretary of State the Director is A.7.305 
entitled to decline to give effect to it if, upon examination, it does not concern serious or 
complex fraud. S 2(1B) of the Criminal Justice Act 1987 provides that the Director shall 
not exercise his powers on a request from the Secretary of State acting in response to a 
request received from an overseas authority within s 2(1A)(b) unless it appears to the 
Director on reasonable grounds that the offence in respect of which he has been requested 
to obtain evidence involves serious or complex fraud. If the Director decides this condition 
is not satisfied then he will return the letter of request to the Secretary of State for execution 
by alternative means. 
(1) The Serious Fraud Office's powers under section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 
1987 
As an investigating authority, the SFO may conduct voluntary interviews and interviews A.7.306 
under caution in the normal manner. However, the SFO also has a range ofcoercive powers 
at its disposal under s 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1987 in relation to interviews and the 
production of documents. They are coercive in the sense that a person who fails to answer 
questions or produce documents as required is liable to be prosecuted for a criminal offence 
under s 2(13), (14), or (16). 
In summary the SFO's coercive powers are as follows:1 
A.7.307 
• s 2(2) allows the SFO to require any person to answer any relevant questions or otherwise 
furnish information with respect to any matter relevant to the investigation, including 
questions about confidential matters; however, s 2(9) entitles the person interviewed to 
refuse to answer on the grounds of legal professional privilege; 
• s 2(3) allows the SFO to require any person to produce to it any relevant documents? 
including confidential documents, but not including documents subject to legal profes-
sional privilege.3 It can also require the person producing them to provide an explana-
tion.* of them; 
• where the SFO considers that to require a person to produce relevant documents would 
be likely to result in them being destroyed, hidden, or moved from the jurisdiction, so as 
to frustrate any criminal investigation, s 2(4) allows it to apply to a court for a warrant to 
search that person's premises and seize the documents. Before granting a search warrant, 
s 2(4)(a) requires the JP to be satisfied either that the person concerned has failed to 
comply with a notice under s 2(3), that it is not practicable to serve such a notice, or that 
service would jeopardise the investigation. 
I See Chapter A.2 for more detail

requirement to provide an explanation. This is replaced in s 447(2) and (3) with a broader power for

although some disclosure may be necessary in some cases.' 
R v Serious Fraud Office ex p Maxwell (Kevin)The Times. 9 October 1992. 
A.7.312 In Marlurood Commercial Inc v Konen! the Court of Appeal dealt with an application made 
by a party to civil proceedings for permission to disclose to the SFO (in compliance with a 
notice given under s 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1987 made as a result of a request 
pursuant to the Criminal Justice (International Co-operation) Act 1990), documents 
disclosed by another party pursuant to its obligations in the civil proceedings and which 
had been brought to England for that purpose. It was held that s 3(3) of the Criminal 
Justice Act 1987 did not override rule 31.22 of the Civil Procedure Rules. However the 
court held that the public interest in the investigation or prosecution of a specific offence 
of serious or complex fraud took precedence over the merely general concern of the courts 
to control the collateral use of compulsorily disclosed documents. In the absence of other 
factors, the court's discretion should, as a matter of principle, prima fade be exercised in 
favour of compliance with a notice under s 2(3) of the 1987 Act; by itself the additional 
factor that the documents had been brought within the jurisdiction for the purposes of 
disclosure by a foreign litigant himself brought compulsorily before the English court 
should not be regarded as a reasonable excuse for non-compliance with the notice; and the 
courts should be prepared to grant permission under CPR 31.22 for their collateral use in 
production to the Director of the SFO.

A s 2(3) notice is an order issued by the SFO which requires the person named (who may A.7.314 
be the person under investigation or another person) to produce to the SFO any specified 
documents' which appear to the SFO to relate to any matter relevant to the investigation 
or any documents of a specified description which appear to him so to relate.2 If the 
documents are produced the SFO can take copies or extracts from them? or require the 
person producing them to provide an explanation of them." If the documents are not 
produced the SFO can require the person to state where they are.s A failure without 
reasonable excuse to comply with a requirement issued under s 2(3) is an offence, as is 
intentionally or recklessly making a false statement.'

be unlawful and liable to be quashed on judicial review. Two factors in particular may result 
in a notice being unlawful. First, the notice may be so widely drawn that it includes 
documents or categories of documents which on any view could not be relevant to an 
inquiry.3 Secondly, where the category of documents is specified by reference to a time 
period, the period may be wholly disproportionate to the period of the alleged offencefi

(4) Search warrants under the CriminalJustice Act 1987, section 2(4) 
A.7.317 In this s the law relating to search warrants under CJA 1987, s 2(4) is analysed. Many of 
these principles are applicable to search warrants in general, including those issued under 
Part 2 and Schedule 1 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE). These latter 
warrants are considered below.' 
I Pursuant co the recommendation in R (Rawl/mon and Hunter Trustees) v Central Criminal Court [2013) 
WLR 1364. applications for s 2 CIA 1987 search warrants are now governed by Pt 47. s 7 of the 
Criminal Procedure Rules 2015 (rr 47.29-47.33: SI 2015/1490. in force 5 October 2015) and the forms 
issued thereunder by the Lord Chief Justice. 
A.7.318 S 2(4) provides that on information' laid on oath by a member of the SFO, a JP,2 if satisfied, 
in relation to any documents, that there are reasonable grounds for believing that either a 
person has failed to comply with a s 2(3) notice; that it is not practicable to serve a s 2(3) 
notice in relation to them; or that the service of such a notice in relation to them might 
seriously prejudice the investigation; and there are reasonable grounds for believing that 
there are such documents on the premises specified in the information, he may issue a 
warrant as is mentioned in s 2(5). 
I The person affected by the warrant is generally entitled to sight of the information in order that he can 
take advice as CO its legality (R (Energy Financing Team Limited) v Director of the Seriora Fraud Office 
120061 I WLR 1316. pan 24(10)). Authorities possess no right co unilaterally redact that letter or 
Information (R (S, F ci• L) v Chief Constable of the British Transport Police [2014) 1 WLR 1647. pans 
109-115): and, in the event that they wish to withhold any of its concerns from the person affected, they 
must apply for a P11 order (Comminioner of Police for the Metropolis v Bangs 12014) EWHC 546 
(Admin)). The same applies to the transcript of the warrant application (R (Golfrate Property 111am:se-
men: Ltd) Er Southwark Crown Court 12014) 2 Cr App R 12. pans 15-18). Mere potential for 
embarrassment is no ground for non-disclosure (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation v The Queen (2014)

A.7.319 A warrant under s 2(5) is a warrant authorising any constable to enter (using such force as 
is reasonably necessary for the purpose) and search the premises, and to take possession of 
any documents' appearing to be documents of the description specified in the information 
or to take in relation to such documents any other steps which may appear to be necessary 
for preserving them and preventing interference with them. 
I As defined in CJA 1987. s 2(19). Where the documents are held in electronic form then the constable 
can require them to be produced in legible form: PACE, s 20. 
A.7.320 Unless it is not practicable in the circumstances, a constable executing a warrant issued 
under s 2(4) shall be accompanied by an `appropriate person'. Where an appropriate person 
accompanies a constable, he may exercise the powers conferred by s 2(5) but only in the 
company, and under the supervision, of the constable (s 2(6A)). An `appropriate person

means a member of the SFO or some person who is not a member of that Office but whom 
the Director has authorized to accompany the constable (s 2(7)). 
The issue of a search warrant is a serious matter. In addition to the duty to place before the A.7.321 
court all the material necessary to the grant of a warrant,' there is a duty of candour upon 
the SFO; there must be full and complete disclosure to the judge, including disclosure of 
anything that might militate against the grant.2 Misrepresentation or non-disclosure in 
either the information or the oral evidence to the judge will invalidate any warrant obtained 
where the errors or omissions might well (not would in fact) have made a difference to the 
decision to grant the warrant.3 The current practice under s 2(4) of not placing the 
underlying material before the judge' means that the duty of candour is even more 
important than usual; there is a very heavy duty placed on the SFO to ensure that what is 
put before the judge is clear and comprehensive so that the judge can rely on it and form his 
judgment on the basis of a presentation in which he has complete trust and confidence as 
to its accuracy and completeness. Cases in the financial markets investigated by the SFO are 
likely to require the judge to be familiar with the commercial and market background.That 
background must be set out in the written presentation to the judge. The transactions must 
then be explained in a coherent and analytical manner. The allegations of reasonable 
suspicion must then be set out. What is alleged must be verified by persons expert in the 
market or accounting practices whose independent advice has been expressly sought. A 
record of that verification should be retained by the SFO. Not only must the case for 
reasonable suspicion be put, but the matters that might undermine that case must be 
enumerated. The skill and experience required to prepare a presentation of that kind 
cannot be underestimated.5

The duties upon the judge are no less onerous. A judge to whom an application for a A.7.322 
warrant is made must therefore be scrupulously careful to ensure that all the relevant 
statutory conditions are satisfied. It is not sufficient that the judge considers that the 
information and evidence presented is reasonable. The judge must personally be satisfied 
that there is before the judge sufficient material on which it is proper to grant the warrant, 
including grounds for reasonable suspicion.' In particular, he must give reasons for his 
decision to issue a warrant and must state his reasons for being satisfied as to the conditions 
ins 2(4)(a).2

items subject to legal professional privilege are contained within a large number of other 
documents which can lawfully be seized. In such a case, the `seize-and-sift' powers of Part 
of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 contain provisions allowing all the material 
to be seized for later examination and return of the privileged materia1.2 The practice then 
is for the documents to be examined by independent counsel; to determine which items, if

A.7.325 A search warrant which is excessively wide is liable to be quashed.' Limitations are required 
by Art 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights - respect for private and family 
life.2 The warrant must specify, so far as practicable, the items to be sought.3 There is no 
legal requirement to specify individual documents in the warrant, but, it is good practice to 
do so, to the extent practicable.4 A s 2 warrant is much simpler and wider than one under 
s 8 of PACE which requires the material to be likely to be 'relevant evidence'. The warrant 
must only specify items that are relevant to the specific investigation and the specific 
offence being investigated .s Where categories of documents to be seized are defined by 
reference to a time period, the period must bear some reasonable relationship of propor-
tionality to the period relevant to the alleged offence. 
R v Central Criminal Court exp AID Holdings Ltd119921 Crim LR 669. The particularity required will 
depend upon the breadth of the investigation in issue, and the question of where the balance lies in an 
individual case will rarely be answered by reference to prior authority. A broad scope of an investigation 
may require a correspondingly broad power of search: it (Glenn 6 Co (Essex)) v Revenue 6 Customs

An unlawful seizure may not be saved by a repeat 'here and now' notice under s 2 of the A.7.326 
1987 Act) It follows that, although a request from a foreign country may be widely framed, 
once the Secretary of State has made a reference under s 15(2) of CICA 2003, the SFO has 
the responsibility for ensuring that any search warrant under s 2(5) is sufficiently narrowly 
focused to ensure that it does not amount to an unlawful fishing expedition. However, 
equally, the warrant need not be confined to the material sought in the letter of request.2
I Likewise. PACE. s 19 may not be used to re-seize property at a police station and commute what had 
been an unlawful seizure into a lawful seizure: R (Cook) v Serious Organised Crime Agency [2011) I WLR

appropriate tosuspend any order for return of the seized property pending application under s 59 for the

under s 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1987 overrides the privilege.2 A suspect is not entitled 
to refuse to answer on the grounds that it might incriminate him. It follows that, but for the 
restrictions on use contained in s 2(8), its use against the suspect at his trial in the UK would 
violate his right to a fair trial under Article 6 of the ECHR.3 Asa result, it is common

offence.2 
I SI 201312733. These functions were initially exercised the Commission for Customs and Excise and 
then transferred to the I4MRC and then the Borders. Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 transferred 
customs functions to a new agency—the UK Border Agency. The Crime (International Co-operation) 
Act 2003 (Exercise of Functions) Order 2009 SI 2009/3021 now permits the powers conferred on a 
constable to be used, in certain circumstances by a general customs official or by a customs revenue 
officials of the UK Border Agency. 
Defined in Art 2. 
A.7.330 S 16 provides for the extension of the statutorysearch powers in Part 2 of the PACE to cover 
overseas conduct. S 17 provides a free-standing power for a JP to grant a search warrant. In 
both cases, the question of whether material is likely to be relevant and of substantial value 
falls to be assessed on a necessarily more circumscribed basis than if the warrant were being 
sought in aid of a domestic prosecution or investigation. International MLA instruments 
operate on the basis of a high level of mutual trust between signatory states and mini-trials 
to determine the degree of relevance of materials to a future trial in another state is not 
consistent with that principle. In general, assertions of relevance in an MLA request will be 
sufficient to trigger the UK's duty to obtain and submit the materials.' Continuity evidence 
is capable of passing the test for relevance and materiality.

function conferred on a constable by virtue of s 16 in relation to a warrant or order under

substantial value to the investigation and likely to be relevant evidence? 
(iii) the material does not consist of or include items subject to legal professional privilege,3
excluded material,' or special procedure materiaks and 
(iv) any of the conditions in s 8(3) is satisfied in relation to each set of premises specified in 
the application.'

Hunter Trustees) v Central Criminal Coon 12013) 1 WLR 1364, applications for s 8 PACE search 
warrants are now governed by Pt 47, s 3 of the Criminal Procedure Rules 2015 (rr 47.24-47.28) and the 
forms issued thereunder by the Lord Chief Justice. 
That is, anything that would be admissible in evidence at a trial for the offence: PACE, s 8(2). This is an 
additional requirement where the vehicle for seeking mutual legal assistance is the 1984 Act. In choosing 
under CICA 2003. s 13 to direct a request to the police. rather than another body such as the SFO, this 
additional requirement is engaged. However, it is not the case that a request must expressly address this 
requirement in order for an ensuing PACE search warrant to be lawfid the condition may be satisfied by 
inferences drawn from the content of the request: see Van der PO v The Crown Cozen at Kingston [20131 
WLR 3706. 
As defined ins 10 of PACE see R v Central Criminal Court ex p Francis and Francis (a flint) [1989) AC 
346: R v Guillball Magistrates Coon ex p Primlaks Holdings (Panama) Inc (1990) 1 QB 261. 
As defined ins 11 of PACE. 
As defined ins 14 of PACE. But note that excluded material and special procedure material may lawfully 
be seized under s 8(2) where the 'silting' powers in Pt 2 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 
(CJPA 2001) may be utilised. S 59 provides for a statutory procedure by which a claimant who asserts 
that material has been improperly seized using these powers may seek a court order for its return. In R 
(Hogue) v City of London Magistrates' Court 12013) EWHC 725 (Admin), where a s 8 PACE starch 
warrant was held to be unlawful on the basis that it failed to identify the materials sought with sufficient 
particularity, pursuant to which the original exhibits would be returned, determination of whether the 
applicant (HMRQ were nonetheless entitled to retain copies of the seized documents for the purpose of 
continuing criminal proceedings fell to be determined under s 59 CJPA 2001. The position may have 
been different had the warrants been obtained in the absence of reasonable grounds to suspect that an 
offence had been committed, or if copies had been made in contravention of a court order, or if the court 
issuing the warrant had been misled. 
It is not a condition precedent to the grant of a warrant under s 8 that other methods of obtaining the 
material have been tried without success or not been tried because they were bound to fail: R v Billericay

application (in which case the application is for a 'specific premises warrane); or any 
premises occupied or controlled by a person specified in the application, including such 
sets of premises as are so specified (in which case the application is for an 'all premises

A.7.335 S 8(IB) provides that if the application is for an all premises warrant, the JP must also be 
satisfied that because of the particulars of the offence referred to in s 8(1)(a), there are 
reasonable grounds for believing that it is necessary to search premises occupied or 
controlled by the person in question which are not specified in the application in order to 
find the material referred to in pars 8(1)(b); and that it is not reasonably practicable to 
specify in the application all the premises which he occupies or controls and which might 
need to be searched. 
A.7.336 The conditions in s 8(3) are that it is not practicable to communicate with any person 
entitled to grant entry to the premises; that it is practicable to communicate with a person 
entitled to grant entry to the premises but it is not practicable to communicate with any 
person entitled to grant access to the evidence; that entry to the premises will not be granted 
unless a warrant is produced; and that the purpose of a search may be frustrated or seriously 
prejudiced unless a constable arriving at the premises can secure immediate entry to them.'

repeatedly emphasized that a JP to whom application is made under s 8 must be careful to

Para 4 of Schedule 1 permits' a judge to issue a production order provided that either of the

whom it is addressed to produce the material to a constable for him to take away or give him 
access to it within seven days from the date of the order (para 4). An application for a 
production order must be made inter parter2 and a notice served on the person concerned 
under para 7.3 Where such a notice has been served the person must not destroy, alter, or 
dispose of the material without the leave of the judge or a constable (pan 11).

A.7.345 The power to allow access to excluded and special procedure material under a search

R v Soutbumrk Crown Can exp Bowles (1998) AC 641.649. In R v Centml Criminal Cart exp AID 
Holdings 119921 Crim LR 669. Nolan LJ observed that the scheme of Sch 1 is that applications should 
normally be made inter panes save for certain exceptions. The fact that a solicitor is under investigation 
does not of itself justify intruding exp into his affairs and those of his clients. All the circumstances must 
be considered, including the seriousness of the matter being investigated, evidence already available to 
the police, and the extent to which the solicitor already knows of the interest in his affairs such as might 
cause him to destroy or interfere with documents; cf RvMaidanne Crown Court, ev p Wain 119881 Crim

premises one would expect the application to be inter panes. but not where the firm itself was under 
investigation. 
A.7.346 In 12 v Central Criminal Courttx p AID Holdings' the court said that it was important before 
any search warrant was applied for that careful consideration was given to what material it 
is hoped a search might reveal, so as to be clear to anyone subsequently considering the 
lawfulness of the warrant. The application should make clear that the material sought 
related to the crime under investigation. A written note should be made of anything said in 
support of the application beyond what was set out in the written application. There should 
be careful briefing of the officers who were to execute the search, including how material to 
be searched for might be thought to relate to the crime under investigation. The warrant 
was quashed because it permitted the officers to search for material which could not have 
been relevant to their investigation. The court also quashed the warrants on two other 
grounds, namely that they wrongly included material subject to legal privilege, and that in 
any event they should have been applied for inter panes.

If no one is present then a copy of the warrant must be left at the premises? S 16(8) 
provides that the search must be a search to the extent required for the purpose for which

an item has been obtained in consequence of the commission of an offence or if it is evidence in relation 
to an offence he is investigating or of any other offence. Even if items outside the warrant or s 19 are

C. Requests by Foreign States to the UK 
(A.7.406] 
Once a circuit judge has made an ex pane order issuing a warrant pursuant to Schedule 1, A.7.404 
pars 12, he has no power to review or rescind the order, even if it can be shown that he made 
it on an erroneous basis, having been given inaccurate or incomplete information.' Instead, 
the aggrieved party must apply directly for judicial review.2 In Barclays Bank pie (Trading as 
Barclaycard) v Taylor3 the Court of Appeal held that, irrespective of whether a notice under 
Schedule 1 of PACE is defective, an access order once made, being valid on its face, is fully 
effective until set aside by due process; and that since a banker's duty of confidentiality to 
his client is qualified by the exception of disclosure under compulsion of law, a bank which 
complies with an access order is not thereby in breach of its duty to its client.4 The same 
principles apply to search warrants generally.5 
I Whether under s 59 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 (R (Goode) v Nottingham Gown Court 
120131 EWHC 1726 (Admin). pan 51: R (Graudhary) v Bristol Crown Court 120161 1 WLR 631): or

119891 1 WLR 1066. 
The court went on to say that since such an order could not be made by consent and the responsibility 
for deciding whether the access conditions were satisfied rested with the judge making the order, and 
since the public interest in assisting the police investigation of crime might be fnistrated if the account 
holder knew of the application. it is not necessary for the purpose of giving business efficacy to the 
banker—client relationship to imply an obligation that the bank, in the absence of special circumstances 
known only to itself should either oppose or probe the application or supporting evidence, or that it 
should inform its client of the application. 
A warrant is 'valid unless and until it is quashed. Until quashed it remains a lawful authority and 
justification for any entry or seizure if such is in accordance with its terms: AC v Nottingham Magistrates 
Court [2013] EWHC 3790 (Admin), pan 25. citing R (Goode) v Nottingham Crown Court [2013] 
EWHC 1728 (Admin). pan 52 and McGrath v Chief Constable of the Rost Ulster Constabulary [2001] 
AC 731. 
In R (Bright) v Central Criminal Court [20001 1 WLR 662 the Divisional Court held that A.7.405 
where the first set of access conditions in Schedule 1 is found to be fulfilled, the fact that 
compliance with the order by the person ordered to make production may involve him in 
incriminating himself is not per sea reason for not making an order. 
(3) Use of the powers in Pan 2 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 
following a request for mutual assistance 
Having considered their domestic effect, the use of the Part 2 procedures in the mutual A.7.406 
assistance context can now be examined. In summary, the territorial authority may under 
CICA 2003, s 13(1)(6) direct that a search warrant or production order' be applied for 
under s 16 of the Act.2 S 16 provides that search warrants under Part 2 of PACE may be 
issued in respect of overseas criminal conduct provided that the condition of dual 
criminality is satisfied. 
S 13(1)(b) in fact refers only to warrants and not orders. That was a legislative oversight and s 13(1)(b) 
should be read as if it did include power to direct that a production order should be applied for under 
PACE 1984. Sch 1: R (Secretary of State fir the Home Department) n Southwark Gown Court 12014] 1

See CICA 2003 s 16(3) in relation to Nonhem Ireland. As with extradition. that dual criminality 
assessment requires an essentially factual rather than legal comparison, and does not require precise 
correlation of the elements of the respective offences. Where, therefore. on a fraud allegation, the 
equivalent German offence required no showing of dishonesty. bur allegations of dishonesty ran through 
the factual allegations, the requirement was satisfied: Brookfield Aviation International Ltd v Gulled 
Crown Court (2015) EWHC 3465 (Admin). 
A.7A08 But an application for a warrant or order by virtue of s 16(1) may be made only in 
pursuance of a direction given under s 13 (s 16(2)(a)), or if it is an application for a warrant 
or order under s 8 of, or Schedule 1 to, the Police and Criminal Evidence Act by a constable 
for the purposes of an investigation by an international joint investigation team of which he 
is a member (s 16(2)(b)). 
A.7A09 An 'international joint investigation team has the meaning given by s 88(7) of the Police 
Act 1996.1 Thus, where the application has been made by the member of such a team, a 
direction by the Secretary of State need not have been given. S 16(2)(b) thus allows joint 
investigation teams to investigate cases of serious criminal activity with links to one or more 
Member State2 in the UK. 
ie. any investigation team formed in accordance with any Framework Decision on joint investigation 
teams OJ L162/1. 20.6.02; the EU Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters and its 
Protocol; or any international agreement to which the UK is a parry and which is specified for the 
purposes of this sin an order made by the Secretary of State. 
This provision implements Art 13 of the EU Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters 
(entitled 'Joint investigation teams'). Their purpose is to any out joint investigations into crimes with 
cross-border elements, with a view to improving and speeding up the investigation of such crimes.

A.7.410 S 17(1) of CICA 2003 provides that a JP may issue a warrant under s 17 if he is satisfied, 
on an application made by a constable, that criminal proceedings have been instituted 
against a person in a country outside the UK, or a person has been arrested in the course of 
a criminal investigation carried on there; the conduct constituting the offence which is the 
subject of the proceedings or investigation would, if it occurred in England and Wales 
constitute an indictable offence;1 or there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that there 
is on premises in England and Wales2 occupied or controlled by that person evidence 
relating to the offence)

Chapter A7: Mutual Legal Assistance in Cases of Fraud 
A.7.416 In R v Central Criminal Court ex p Propend Finance Property Ltd 11996] 2 Cr App R 26 the 
Divisional Court considered whether the Secretary of State was required under the 
equivalent provision to s 16 in the Criminal Justice (International Co-operation) Act 1990 
to specify in his direction what form of warrant or order should be obtained Laws J held 
that it should have done so, and that the failure to do so rendered the warrants unlawful: 
In our judgment, the Secretary of State has not only the responsibility of deciding 
whether assistance should be given to the requesting state; in our view he must also 
decide what assistance should so be given. S 7(4) authorizes only a unitary direction, 
specifying a particular form of application ... It was submitted to us by [counsel for 
the Secretary of State] that the police possess an experience and expertise in the 
administration of the PACE procedures which the Secretary of State does not share. 
But he has specific responsibilities under the Act of 1984 to oversee certain processes 
by the police: see s 66. So that submission does not, in our judgment, assist the 
Secretary of State.' 
I This passage was, however, doubted by Brooke LJ in an °biter diem in R o Southwark Crown Court ex p 
Gross. Unreported, 24 July 1998 (CO 1759198). He preferred a construction of s 7 which permitted the 
Secretary of State to leave it to the police CO decide whether a production order or search warrant under 
Sch I of PACE should be obtained. 
(v) Transmission of the evidence 
A.7A17 Once the request has been executed and the evidence been obtained either in proceedings 
under CICA 2003, s 15 before a nominated court, by the SFO, or using the powers ins 16 
and 17, the evidence may be transmitted to the requesting state either directly or indirectly. 
A.7.418 In relation to proceedings before a nominated court, pars 6(1) of Schedule I of the CICA 
2003 provides that the evidence received by the court is to be given to the court or authority 
that made the request or to the territorial authority for forwarding to the court or authority 
that made the request. So far as may be necessary in order to comply with the request where 
the evidence consists of a document, the original or a copy is to be provided, and where it 
consists of any other article, the article itself, or a description, photograph, or other 
representation of it, is to be provided (pare 6(2)). 
A.7A19 By s 2(8A) of the Criminal Justice Act 1987, any evidence obtained by the Director for use 
by an overseas authority must be given to the overseas authority which requested it, or given 
to the Secretary of State for forwarding to that overseas authority. If the Director makes a 
direct transmission he will normally require the provision of an undertaking that the 
document or other information obtained will not be used other than in criminal prosecu-
tions arising from the investigation set out in this letter of request, without the prior 
consent of the Secretary of State for the Home Department. 
A.7.420 S 19(1) of CICA 2003 allows any evidence seized under ss 16-18 to be sent directly by a 
constable to the requesting court or authority, unless the requesting territory is not a party 
to the EU Convention on Mutual Legal Assistance on Criminal Matters, in which case the 
evidence will be sent to the territorial authority for forwarding to the requesting court or 
authority.'

constable where the evidence has been seized by an officer of Revenue and Customs under 
a search warrant or production order issued by virtue of s 16, or a search warrant issued

Whilst the point is not free from doubt, it would appear that the Secretary of State or other A.7.422 
territorial authority retains a discretion to transmit the evidence and that it could decline to 
do so if it would not be appropriate. Specifically, the Secretary of State is bound to act in 
accordance with the obligations of the Human Rights Act. Whilst in the absence of any 
objection from the persons affected the Secretary of State is entitled to forward the material 
received from the executing authority to the requesting state, where an objection is raised 
the Secretary ofState should not forward the material until the question has been resolved.'

The representatives of the foreign state are permitted to have some limited access to the A.7.423

(I) Use of the evidence in the requesting state 
CICA 2003 does not on its face limit the use of the evidence to the reasons it is needed as A.7.424 
listed in the request. However, once the evidence has been transmitted to the requesting 
state it is not free to use it as it wishes. Before transmission takes place, the UK Central 
Authority generally requires the requesting authority to provide an undertaking that the 
evidence will only be used for the purposes for which assistance was granted, that is, that no 
document or other information obtained will be used other than in the criminal prosecu-
tions arising from the investigation set out in the letter of request without the prior consent 
of the Secretary of State.' 
Para 32(3) of the Harare Scheme contains a specific restriction to this effect. Some countries, eg 
Switzerland. have entered reservations to An 2(b) of the European Convention on Martial Assistance 
1959 requiring such an undertaking before assistance will be given. The UK did not enter a reservation

A.7.425 This form of undertaking provides a form of 'specialty protection analogous to that which 
exists for extradition defendants. 
(vi) Hearing evidence from the UK by television or telephone link 
A.7.426 Sections 30 and 31 of CICA 2003 introduce new measures to allow evidence of witnesses 
(not defendants) to be taken in the UK and transmitted by television or telephone to 
criminal proceedings being conducted abroad. 
(I) Television links 
A.7A27 S 30 applies where the Secretary of State receives a request from an authority mentioned in 
s 30(2) ('the external authority'), for a person in the UK to give evidence through a live 
television link in criminal proceedings before a court in a country outside the UK. For these 
purposes, criminal proceedings include any proceedings on an appeal before a court against 
a decision in administrative proceedings. 
A.7.428 The authority referred to in s 30(2) is the authority in that country which appears to the 
Secretary of State to have the function of making requests of the kind to which this s 
applies. 
A.7A29 Unless he considers it inappropriate to do so, the Secretary of State must by notice in 
writing nominate a court in the UK where the witness may be heard in the proceedings in 
question through a live television link (s 30(3)). 
A.7A30 By s 30(4) anything done by the witness in the presence of the nominated court which, if 
it were done in proceedings before the court would constitute contempt of court, is to be 
treated for that purpose as done in proceedings before the court. Any statement made on 
oath by a witness giving evidence in pursuance of s 30 is to be treated for the purposes of s 
of the Perjury Act 1911 as made in proceedings before the nominated court. 
A.7A31 Pan 1 of Schedule 2 (evidence given by television link) contains detailed provisions 
concerning evidence by television link Subject to s 30(4) and (5) and the provisions of that 
Schedule, evidence given pursuant to this s is not to be treated for any purpose as evidence 
given in proceedings in the UK. 
(2) Telephone links 
A.7A32 S 31 applies where the Secretary of State receives a request, from an authority mentioned in 
s 31(2) ('the external authority') in a participating country, for a witness in the UK to give 
evidence by telephone in criminal proceedings before a court in that country. Criminal 
proceedings include any proceedings on an appeal before a court against a decision in 
administrative proceedings.

C. Requests by Foreign States to the UK 
(A.7.441] 
Elie authority mentioned ins 31(2) is the authority in that country which appears to the A.7.433 
Secretary of State to have the function of making requests of the kind to which this s 
applies. 
A request under s 31(1) must specify the court in the participating country; give the name A.7.434 
and address of the witness; and state that the witness is willing to give evidence by telephone 
in the proceedings before that court (s 31(3)). 
By s 31(4), unless he considers it inappropriate to do so, the Secretary of State must by A.7.435 
notice in writing nominate a court in the UK where the witness may be heard in the 
proceedings in question by telephone. 
Anything done by the witness in the presence of the nominated court which, if it were done A.7.436 
in proceedings before the court would constitute contempt of court, is to be treated for that 
purpose as done in proceedings before the court. Any statement made on oath by a witness 
giving evidence in pursuance of this s is to be treated for the purposes of s 1 of the Perjury 
Act 1911 as made in proceedings before the nominated court (s 31(5)). 
Part 2 of Schedule 2 contains detailed provisions concerning telephone link evidence. 
A.7.437 
Subject to s 31(5) and (6) and the provisions of Schedule 2, evidence given in pursuance of A.7.438 
s 31 is not to be treated for any purpose as evidence given in proceedings in the UK. 
(3) Overseas requests to freeze evidence in the UK 
This section examines the way in which overseas orders to freeze evidence located in the UK A.7.439 
can be received and executed in the UK. CICA 2003, ss 20-27 give effect to the principle 
of mutual recognition of overseas freezing orders, and implements in part the Framework 
Decision Council Framework Decision on the execution in the EU of orders freezing 
property or evidence (referred to in this s as the Freezing Framework Decision),I 
2003/577/JHA, 22 July 2003: OJ L 196. 2.08.2003. See pan 66 of the Explanatory Notes DO CICA 
2003. See generally A V Director of Public Prosecutions [2017) 1 WLR 713. CA: a chalknge to the 
substantive reasons for making an overseas restraint order may only be made in the courts of the 
requesting stare and is not justiciable in the UK courts. 
Schedule 4 of CICA 2003 contains amendments to Schedule 4 of the Terrorism Act 2000 A.7.440 
which provide for mutual recognition of freezing orders in relation to terrorist property. 
(vii) Receiving an overseas freezing order 
20 of CICA 2003 sets out the conditions that must be met before the territorial authority A.7.441 
in the UK, namely the Secretary of State or the Lord Advocate, sends the overseas freezing 
order to a court to be considered for execution under s 21.

(A.7.442) 
Chapter A7: Mutual Legal Assistance in Cases of Fraud 
A.7.442 S 20(1) provides that s 21 applies where an overseas freezing order made by a court or 
authority in a `participating country" is received from the court or authority which made 
or confirmed the order by the territorial authority for the part of the UK in which the 
evidence to which the order relates is situated. 
By CICA 2003, s 51(2), a participating country means Denmark or the Republic of Ireland and any 
other country designated by an order made by the Secretary of State or, in relation to Scotland. the 
Scottish Ministers. Existing Orders made under s 51(2) are set out at n 156. paraparaparaparapara 
A.7.443 An overseas freezing order is an order for protecting, pending its transfer to the participat-
ing country, evidence which is in the UK, and may be used in any proceedings or 
investigation in the participating country, and in respect of which the following require-
ments are met. 
• the order must have been made by a court exercising criminal jurisdiction in the country; 
a prosecuting authority in the country; or any other authority in the country which 
appears to the territorial authority to have the function of making such orders (s 20(3));1
• the order must relate to criminal proceedings instituted in the participating country in 
respect of a listed offence? or a criminal investigation being carried on there into such an 
offence (s 20(4)); 
• the order must be accompanied by a certificate which gives the specified information;3 
but a certificate may be treated as giving any specified information which is not given in 
it if the territorial authority has the information in question. References in Chapter 2 of 
Pan 1 of CICA 2003 to an overseas freezing order include its accompanying certificate 
(s 20(5)); 
• the certificate must be signed by or on behalf of the court or authority which made or 
confirmed the order; include a statement as to the accuracy of the information given in 
it; if k is not in English, include a translation of it into English (or, if appropriate, Welsh) 
(s 20(6)); 
• the order must be accompanied by a request for the evidence to be sent to a court or 
authority mentioned in s 13(2), unless the certificate indicates when such a request is 
expected to be made (s 20(7)). 
In relation to clause 20(3)(c) of the Bill (now CICA 2003, s 20(3)(c)) the Attorney-General said during 
the Committee stage in the House of Lords (see HL Deb 23 January 2003. GC84 and 85): '... the 
purpose of Clause 20(3)(c) is to cover all judicial authorities in ocher EU countries. I say "other EU 
countries" because that is the limit on the application of this provision. EU judicial authorities are 
designated under the 1959 Council of Europe convention, so they are clearly identified ... For many 
years. we have been able to execute requests for mutual legal assistance. induding for search and seizure, 
by authorities of this type. S 7(4)(b) of the 1990 Act includes that type of person. That is re-enacted by 
Clause 13(2)(b) of the Bill. So the provision merely applies to the new concept of the freezing order the 
same approach that has already been adopted in relation to mutual legal assistance. It has not caused any 
difficulties in practice. It must be available for the enforcement of overseas freezing orders.' 
A listed offence means an offence described in Art 3(2) of the Council Framework Decision, or an 
offence prescribed or of a description prescribed by an order made by the Secretary of State (s 2800. 
By s 28(7). this is any information required to be given by the form of CCIIIIIC2EC annexed to the Council 
Framework Decision, or any information prescribed by an order made by the Secretary of State. The

SLIM 
(viii) Nominating a court 
S 21(1)(a) of CICA 2003 provides that if the conditions of s 20 are met the territorial A.7.444 
authority must nominate a court in England and Wales or (as the case may be) Northern 
Ireland to give effect to the overseas freezing order; send a copy of the overseas freezing 
order to the nominated court and to the chief officer of police for the area in which the 
evidence is situated; and tell the chief officer which court has been nominated. 
The nominated court is to consider the overseas freezing order on its own initiative within A.7.445 
a period prescribed by rules of court (s 21(3)). Before giving effect to the overseas freezing 
order, the nominated court must give the chief officer of police an opportunity to be heard 
(s 21(4)). 
The court may decide not to give effect to the overseas freezing order only if, in its opinion, A.7.446 
one of the following conditions is met (s 21(4)). The first condition is that, if the person 
whose conduct is in question were charged in the participating country with the offence to 
which the overseas freezing order relates or in the UK with a corresponding offence, he 
would be entitled to be discharged under any rule of law relating to previous acquittal or 
conviction (s 21(6)). The second condition is that giving effect to the overseas freezing 
order would be incompatible with any of the Convention rights within the meaning of the 
Human Rights Act 1998 (s 21(7)). 
(ix) Giving Ort to the overseas freezing order 
S 22 of CICA 2003 provides the mechanism whereby the nominated court gives effect to A.7.447 
the overseas freezing order. 
S 22(1) provides that the nominated court is to give effect to the overseas freezing order by A.7.448 
issuing a warrant authorizing a constable to enter the premises to which the oversews 
freezing order relates and search the premises to the extent reasonably required for the 
purpose of discovering any evidence to which the order relates, and to seize and retain any 
evidence fin which he is authorized to search. But, in relation to England and Wales and 
Northern Ireland, so far as the overseas freezing order relates to excluded material or special 
procedure material' the court is to give effect to the order by making a production order 
(s 22(2)).

[A.7.449] 
Chapter A7: Mutual Legal Assistance in Cases of Fraud 
A.7.449 S 26(1) provides that the court may not issue a warrant under s 22 in respect of any 
evidence unless the court has reasonable grounds for believing that it does not consist of or 
include items subject to legal privilege, excluded material, or special procedure material. S 
26(l) does not prevent a warrant under s 22(5) being issued for special procedure material 
or excluded material. 
A.7.450-500 A production order is an order for the person who appears to the court to be in possession 
of the material to produce it to a constable before the end of the period of seven days 
beginning with the date of the production order or such longer period as the production 
order may specify. The constable may take away any material produced to him under a 
production order; and the material is to be treated for the purposes of s 21 of PACE as if it 
had been seized by the constable (s 22(3)). 
A.7.501 If a person fails to comply with a production order, the court may (whether or not it deals 
with the matter as a contempt of court) issue a warrant under s 22(1) in respect of the 
material to which the production order relates (s 22(5)). 
A.7.502 S 23 provides that the nominated court may postpone giving effect to an overseas freezing 
order in respect of any evidence in order to avoid prejudicing a criminal investigation which 
is taking place in the UK or, if under an order made by a court in criminal proceedings in 
the UK, the evidence may not be removed from the UK. 
(x) Evidence seized under the order 
A.7.503 S 24(1) of CICA 2003 provides that any evidence seized by or produced to the constable 
under s 22 is to be retained by him until he is given a notice under s 24(2) or authorized to 
release it under s 25(2). 
A.7.504 By s 24(2), if the overseas freezing order was accompanied by a request for the evidence to 
be sent to a court or authority mentioned in s 13(2), or the territorial authority subse-
quently receives such a request, the territorial authority may by notice require the constable 
to send the evidence to the court or authority that made the request. 
(xi) Release of evidence held under the order 
A.7.505 On an application made by a person mentioned in CICA 2003, s 25(1), the nominated 
court may authorize the release of any evidence retained by a constable under s 24 if, in its 
opinion the condition in s 21(6) or (7) is met (double jeopardy and human rights), or the 
overseas freezing order has ceased to have effect in the participating country. 
A.7.506 In relation to England and Wales and Northern Ireland, the persons who may make such 
an application are the chief officer of police to whom a copy of the order was sent, the 
constable, or any other person affected by the order (s 25(2)).

evidence retained by a constable under that section, the authority must give the constable 
a notice authorising him to release the evidence (s 25(4)). 
(c) Requests for UK bank transaction information 
Chapter 4 of Part 1 of CICA 2003 provides for the disclosure of banking information in A.7.508 
connection with criminal investigations in EU Member States or other designated states.' 
Chapter 4 implements the 2001 Protocol to the EU Convention on Mutual Assistance in 
Criminal Matters? The purpose of the Protocol is to tackle serious crime, in particular 
economic crime and money laundering. Countries participating in the 2001 Protocol are 
obliged to identify, provide information about, and monitor bank accounts at the request 
of other participating countries, subject to certain restrictions and conditions which are 
explained in more detail below. The 2001 Protocol obliges participating countries to 
establish mechanisms whereby they can provide the stipulated information. The manner in 
which they do so is left to individual participating countries.

(I) Request for customer information from a UK financial institution 
(I) Receipt of request 
CICA 2003, s 32 applies where the Secretary of State receives a request from an authority A.7.509 
mentioned ins 32(2) for customer information to be obtained in relation to a person who 
appears to him to be subject to an investigation in a participating country' into serious 
criminal conduct. 
I A participating country means Denmark or the Republic of Ireland. and any other country designated 
by an order made by the Secretary of Snit or. in relation CO Scotland, the Scottish Ministers: CICA 2003. 
s 51(2). Existing Orders made under s 51(2) are set out at n 1%. 
The authority mentioned in s 32(2) is the authority in a participating country which A.7.510 
appears to the Secretary of State to have the function of making requests of the kind to 
which this s applies. 
After receiving a request the Secretary of State may direct a senior police officer' to apply, A.7.511 
or arrange for a constable to apply, for a customer information order; or direct a senior 
customs officer2 to apply, or arrange for a customs officer to apply, for such an order 
(s 32(3))) During the debate on the Crime (International Co-operation) Bill the Minister

One of the matters that the Secretary of State will take into account will be whether 
the request contains the information specified in Article I of the protocol, in 
particular the conditions in Article 1(4). That includes, for example, the requirement 
that the requesting authority state why it is considered that the requested information 
is likely to be of substantial value to the investigation. If that information is not given, 
refusal may follow. The test is the same as one of the tests under domestic law in 
PACE.4 We are confident, therefore, that we will not be allowing fishing expeditions.

The question of whether material is likely to be relevant and of substantial value is to be assessed on a 
necessarily more circumscribed basis than if the warrant were being sought in aid of a domestic 
prosecution or investigation. International MLA instruments operate on the basis of a high level of 
mutual trust between signatory states, and mini-trials to determine the degree of relevance of materials 
to a future trial in another state are not consistent with that principle. In general. assertions of relevance 
in an MLA request will be sufficient to trigger the UK's duty to obtain and submit the materials Winder

A.7.512 S 32(4) defines a customer information order to be an order made by a judge' that a 
financial institution specified in the application for the order must, on being required to 
do so by notice in writing given by the applicant for the order, provide any such customer 
information as it has relating to the person specified in the application. 
ie in England and Wales. a judge entitled to exercise the jurisdiction of the Crown Court: CICA 2003, 
s 46(5)(a). 
CICA 2003, s 46(4) defines a 'financial institution to be a person who is carrying on business in the 
regulated sector, and in relation to a customer information order or an account monitoring order. 
includes a person who was carrying on business in the regulated sector at a time which is the time to 
which any requirement for him to provide information under the order is to relate. 'Business in the 
regulated sector' is to be interpreted in accordance with Sch 9 to POCA. 
A.7.513 A financial institution which is required to provide information under a customer infor-
mation order must provide the information to the applicant for the order in such manner, 
and at or by such time, as the applicant requires (s 32(5)). A customer information order 
has effect in spite of any restriction on the disclosure of information (however imposed) 
(s 32(7)). Thus a financial institution may lawfully disclose information under a customer 
information order in spite of the duty of confidentiality it owes to the account holder. 
A.7.514 'Customer information is defined in s 32(6) by reference to the definition of that term in 
POCA. S 32(6) of CICA 2003 provides that s 364 of POCA (meaning of customer 
information), excepts 364(2)(f) and (3)(i), has effect for the purposes of s 32 as if it were 
included in Chapter 2 of Part 8 of POCA. S 364(1) provides that 'customer information, 
in relation to a person and a financial institution, is information whether the person holds, 
or has held, an account or accounts or any safe deposit box at the financial institution 
(whether solely or jointly with another) and (if so) information as to the matters specified 
ins 364(2) if the person is an individual; and the matters specified in s 364(3) if the person 
is a company or limited liability partnership or a similar body incorporated or otherwise

C. Requests by Foreign States to the UK 
[A.7.520] 
Customer information obtained in pursuance of a customer information order is to be A.7.515 
given to the Secretary of State and sent by him to the authority which made the request 
(s 32(8)). 
It is an offence for a financial institution to fail to comply with a customer information A.7.516 
order. S 34(1) provides that a financial institution is guilty of an offence if without 
reasonable excuse it fails to comply with a requirement imposed on it under a customer 
information order. A financial institution guilty of an offence under s 34(1) is liable on 
summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale. 
A financial institution is also guilty of an offence if, in purported compliance with a A.7.517 
customer information order, it makes a statement which it knows to be false or misleading 
in a material particular, or recklessly makes a statement which is false or misleading in a 
material particular. A financial institution guilty of an offence under s 34(3) is liable, on 
summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum, or on conviction on 
indictment, to a fine. 
(2) Making, varying, and discharging a customer information order 
A judge may make a customer information order, on an application made to him pursuant A.7.518 
to a direction under s 32(3), if he is satisfied that the person specified in the application is 
subject to an investigation in the country in question; the investigation concerns conduct 
which is serious criminal conduct;' the conduct constitutes an offence in England and 
Wales or (as the case may be) Northern Ireland, or would do were it to occur there; and the 
order is sought for the purposes of the investigation (s 33(O). 
CICA 2003. s 46(3) provides that serious criminal conduct means conduct which constitutes an offence 
to which An 1(3) of the 2001 Protocol applies, or an offence specified in an order made by the Secretary 
of State or. in relation to Scotland, the Scottish Ministers for the purpose of giving effen to any decision 
of the Council of the EU under An 1(6). Article I (3) of the Protocol includes inter alia offences which 
are punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of at least four years in the requesting Member 
State and two years in the requested state. 
The application may be made ex pane to a judge in chambers (s 33(2)). The application A.7.519 
may specify: all financial institutions; a description, or particular descriptions, of financial 
institutions; or a particular financial institution or particular financial institutions 
(s 33(3)). 
The court may discharge or vary a customer information order on an application made by A.7.520 
the person who applied for the order, a senior police officer, a constable authorized by a 
senior police officer to make the application, a senior customs officer, or a customs officer 
authorized by a senior customs officer to make the application (s 33(0).

(ii) Requests to the UK to monitor bank accounts 
A.7.521 Sections 35 and 36 implement Art 3 of the 2001 Protocol in relation to incoming requests 
for account monitoring orders. Art 3 provides for requests to be made for a specified bank 
account to be monitored during a specified period of time. Such a request might be made 
subsequent to an Art 1 request for bank details or in cases where the investigator already has 
the details of the relevant account. Account monitoring procedures were introduced in the 
UK under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002,1 but separate provision is required in this Act 
to ensure that the UK can respond to all requests that meet the requirements of the 2001 
Protocol, which has a wider scope than POCA. 
See POCA. s 370. 
(I) RequestJri an account monitoring order 
A.7.522 S 33 of CICA 2003 applies where the Secretary of State receives a request from an authority 
mentioned in s 35( 2) for account information to be obtained in relation to an investigation 
in a participating country' into criminal conduct. 
A participating country means Denmark or the Republic of Ireland and any other country designated by 
an order made by the Secretary of State or, in relation to Scotland. the Scottish Ministers.: CICA 2003. 
s 51(2). For existing Orders made under s 51(2). seen 156. 
A.7.523 The authority referred to in s 35(2) is the authority in that country which appears to the 
Secretary of State to have the function of making requests of the kind to which this s 
applies. 
A.7.524 The Secretary of State may direct a senior police officer' to apply, or arrange for a constable 
to apply, for an account monitoring order; or direct a senior customs officer2 to apply, or 
arrange for a customs officer to apply, for such an order. 
ie, a police officer who is not below the rank of superintendent: CICA 2003. s 46(1). 
ie. a customs officer who is not below the grade designated by the Commissioners of Customs and Excise 
as equivalent to the rank of superintendent: CICA 2003. s 46(1). 
A.7.525 An account monitoring order is an order made by a judge that a financial institution' 
specified in the application for the order must, for the period stated in the order,2 provide 
account information of the description specified in the order to the applicant in the 
manner, and at or by the time or times, stated in the order (s 35(4)). An account monitoring 
order has effect in spite of any restriction on the disclosure of information (however 
imposed) and so overrides the institution's duties of confidentiality (s 35(6)). 
CICA 2003, s 46(4) defines a 'financial institution to be a person who is carrying on business in the 
egulated sector, and in relation to a customer information order or an account monitoring order, 
includes a person who was carrying on business in the regulated sector at a time which is the time to 
which any requirement for him to provide information under the order is ID relate. 'Business in the 
egulated sector' is to be interpreted in accordance with Sch 9 to POCA. 
In relation ro this period the Government's Explanatory Notes to CICA 2003. para 98 comment: Article 
3(3) of the 2001 Protocol provides that the order shall be made with due regard for the national law of 
the requested Member State. Under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, account monitoring orders may be 
made for a period of up Da. 90 days and the same restriction will apply to requests under the 2001

Protocol. No limit is stated because the arrangements will be made between the relevant authorities on 
a case by case basis, as provided for in article 3(4) of the 2001 Protocol.' 
Account information is information relating to an account or accounts held at the financial A.7.526 
institution specified in the application by the person so specified (whether solely or jointly 
with another) (s 35(5)). 
Account information obtained in pursuance of an account monitoring order is to be given A.7.527 
to the Secretary of State and sent by him to the authority which made the request (s 35(7)). 
(2) Making, varying, or discharging account monitoring orders 
CICA 2003, S 36(1) provides that a judge may make an account monitoring order, on an A.7.528 
application made to him in pursuance of a direction under s 35(3), if he is satisfied that 
there is an investigation in the country in question into criminal conduct, and the order is 
sought for the purposes of the investigation. 
The application may be made ex parte to a judge in chambers (s 36(2)). 
A.7.529 
The application may specify information relating to all accounts held by the person A.7.530 
specified in the application for the order at the financial institution so specified; a particular 
description, or particular descriptions, of accounts so held; or a particular account, or 
particular accounts, so held (s 36(3)). 
The court may discharge or vary an account monitoring order on an application made by A.7.531 
the person who applied for the order; a senior police officer, a constable authorized by a 
senior police officer to make the application, a senior customs officer, or a customs officer 
authorized by a senior customs officer to make the application (s 36(4)). 
Account monitoring orders have effect as if they were orders of the court (s 36(5)). 
A.7.532 
(3) The offence of disclosure in relation to customer information orders and account 
monitoring orders 
In order to be effective it is obvious that customer information orders and account A.7.533 
monitoring orders must remain confidential. S 42 of CICA 2003 makes it an offence for a 
financial institution or its employees to disclose information about these orders. 
S 42 applies where a financial institution is specified in a customer information order or A.7.534 
account monitoring order made in any part of the UK, or the Secretary of State or the Lord 
Advocate receives a request under s 13 for evidence to be obtained from a financial 
institution in connection with the investigation of an offence in reliance on Article 2 
(requests for information on banking transactions) of the 2001 Protocol.

D. Mutual Legal Assistance in Relation to Restraint 
and Confiscation 
(a) Introduction 
A.7.538 The statutory provisions analysed in this section give effect to the UK's international 
obligations to assist other states in relation to restraint and confiscation of the proceeds of 
crime.' Specific powers relating to the gathering of evidence for use in confiscation matters 
are also considered in this section? General powers relating to the gathering of evidence 
and information including banking information have been considered above in the context 
of mutual assistance in the provision of evidence, 
See in particular the European Convention on Laundering, Search Seizure and Confiscation of the 
Proceeds of Crime (CETS 141; European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters 
(CF.TS 30); the EU Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters (20001C197101) and the 
Council Framework Decision of 26 June 2001 on Money Laundering, the Identification, Tracing, 
Freezing, Seizing and Confiscation of Instrumentalities and the Proceeds of Crime (OJ 2001 L18211). 
See pass A.7.608 and A.7.714. 
A number of general powers for requesting evidence from overseas are contained in Chapter 2 of Pt I of 
CICA 2003. Sections 43-45 of CICA 2003 permit UK judicial authorities to make requests for banking 
information to foreign states at the request of designated prosecuting authorities in cases of serious 
criminal conduct. 
A.7.539 The relevant statutory provisions are contained in both primary and secondary legislation. 
Part 2 of POCA contains provisions which allow requests for assistance to be made to 
foreign states by prosecutors in connection with restraint and confiscation.' Part I I of 
POCA is entitled 'Co-operation and contains enabling provisions for the making of 
subordinate legislation for the freezing and realization of the proceeds of crime at the 
request of foreign states,2 and for the enforcement of orders in the different parts of the 
UK)

(b) Requests by the UK for assistance in relation to restraint and confiscation 
This section considers the powers available to prosecuting authorities in the UK to seek the 
assistance of foreign states in relation to restraint and confiscation orders made in the UK. 
A.7.541 
(i) Requests by the UK for assistance in restraining property abroad 
and enfircing confiscation orders 
The confiscation provisions of Parts 2-4 of POCA 2002 apply to all of the defendant's A.7.542 
property wherever it happens to be situated.' It follows that assistance may be required 
from foreign states in order to preserve the defendant's property to prevent it from being 
dissipated prior to confiscation.2The High Court can also order the defendant to repatriate 
his assets held abroad,3 and assistance from foreign states may also be needed in order to 
facilitate this process.

Where the UK requires assistance from a foreign state then a letter of request may be sent A.7.543 
under CICA 2003, s 7. In addition, a prosecutor may make a request for assistance under 
POCA, s 74 (or in the case of Scotland, s 141 and Northern Ireland, s 222).1 Assistance in 
investigations often also takes place informally between police forces via Interpol.2 No

A.7.544 Part 2 of POCA is entitled 'Confiscation: England and Wales'. S 74 is entitled 'Enforce-
ment abroad' and sets out the conditions which must be satisfied before a request for 
assistance in the freezing and realization of property abroad may be made by authorities in 
England and Wales to jurisdictions outside the UK. It applies if: any of the conditions in s 
is satisfied; the prosecutor believes that realisable property is situated in a country or 
territory outside the UK (the receiving country); and the prosecutor sends a 'request for 
assistance' to the Secretary of State with a view to it being forwarded under s 74. 
A.7.545 In a case where no confiscation order has been made, a request for assistance is a request to 
the government of the receiving country to secure that any person is prohibited from 
dealing with realisable property (s 74(2)). In a case where a confiscation order has been 
made and has not been satisfied, discharged, or quashed, a request for assistance is a request 
to the government of the receiving country to secure that any person is prohibited from 
dealing with realizable property; that realizable property is realized; and that the proceeds 
are applied in accordance with the law of the receiving country (s 74(3)). 
A.7.546 S 74(4) provides that no request for assistance may be made for the purposes of s 74 in a case 
where a confiscation order has been made and has been satisfied, discharged, or quashed. 
A.7.547 If the Secretary of State believes it is appropriate to do so then, under s 74(5), he may 
forward the request for assistance to the government of the receiving country. 
A.7.548 If property is realized in pursuance of a request under s 74(3) the amount ordered to be paid 
under the confiscation order must be taken to be reduced by an amount equal to the 
proceeds of realization. A certificate purporting to be issued by or on behalf of the requested 
government is admissible as evidence of the facts it states if it states: that property has been 
realized in pursuance of a request under s 74(3); the date of realization; and the proceeds of 
realization (see s 74(7)). 
(1) The conditions in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, section 40 
A.7.549 S 40 of POCA 2002 sets out the conditions which need to be satisfied before a restraint 
order can be made by the Crown Court. If any of these conditions is satisfied then the 
prosecutor may seek the assistance of a foreign state under POCA, s 74. S 40(1) provides 
that the Crown Court may exercise the powers conferred by s 41 if any of the following 
conditions is satisfied. 
A.7.550-600 The first condition is that a criminal investigation has been started in England and Wales 
with regard to an offence, and there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the alleged 
offender has benefited from his criminal conduct (s 40(2), as amended).

The second condition is that proceedings for an offence have been started in England and A.7.601 
Wales and not concluded, and there is reasonable cause to believe that the defendant has 
benefited from his criminal conduct (s 40(3)). The second condition is not satisfied if the 
court believes that there has been undue delay in continuing the proceedings, or the 
prosecutor does not intend to proceed (s 40(7)). 
The third condition is that an application by the prosecutor has been made under ss 19, 20, A.7.602 
27, or 28 and not concluded, or the court believes that such an application is to be made, 
and there is reasonable cause to believe that the defendant has benefited from his criminal 
conduct (s 40(4)). 
The fourth condition is that an application by the prosecutor has been made under s 21 and A.7.603 
not concluded, or the court believes that such an application is to be made, and there is 
reasonable cause to believe that the court will decide under that s that the amount found 
under the new calculation of the defendant's benefit exceeds the relevant amount (as 
defined in that section) (s 40(5)). 
The fifth condition is that an application by the prosecutor has been made under s 22 and A.7.604 
not concluded, or the court believes that such an application is to be made, and there is 
reasonable cause to believe that the court will decide under that s that the amount found 
under the new calculation of the available amount exceeds the relevant amount (as defined 
in that section) (s 40(6)). 
If an application mentioned in the third, fourth, or fifth condition has been made the A.7.605 
condition is not satisfied if the court believes that there has been undue delay in continuing 
the application, or the prosecutor does not intend to proceed (s 40(8)). 
(2) Temporal limitations in respect of requests for assistance 
Art 5 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Commencement No 5, Transitional Provisions, A.7.606 
Savings and Amendment) Order 20031 provides that s 41 (restraint orders) and s 74

(ii) Requests for assistance in evidence gathering in connection with potential 
restraint and confiscation 
A.7.608-611 S 7 of CICA 2003 allows prosecuting authorities to seek the assistance of foreign states in 
connection with the provision of evidence. Requests to foreign states for banking informa-
tion may also be made under CICA 2003, ss 43 and 44. 
(c) Foreign requests to the UK for assistance with restraint and confiscation 
(i) Introduction 
A.7.612 The UK can provide assistance in enforcing foreign forfeiture and confiscation orders in 
respect of assets held in the UK. The UK is also able to restrain assets at the request of 
foreign states. 
A.7.613 Prior to the coming into force of the POCA Order, foreign requests for assistance in 
restraint and confiscation matters were dealt with by different statutory regimes depending 
upon whether the request related to a drugs offence or a non-drugs offence.' The POCA 
Order simplifies the law by providing a single scheme for the enforcement of foreign 
confiscation orders and the provision of assistance in obtaining restraint orders.

Justice Act 1988 (Designated Countries and Territories) Order 1991, SI 1991/2873. 
A.7.614 Whereas under the previous statutory regimes applications for restraint orders at the 
request of foreign states and the enforcement or overseas confiscation orders were made to 
the High Court, under the POCA Order the application is made to the Crown Court.

(ii) Commencement and temporal scope of the proceeds of Crime Act 2002 
(External Requests and Orders) Order 2005 
The POCA Order came into force on 1 January 2006. From that date, requests to the UK A.7.615 
for assistance in restraint and confiscation matters have been dealt with according to its 
terms.' 
I See Perry v Serious Organised Crime Agency (2013) 1 AC 182. pans 58-64.134-135. 
Art 8 of the POCA Order provides that the Crown Court may make a restraint order if A.7.616 
either of the conditions in Art 7 is satisfied. Art 7(4) of the POCA Order provides that in 
determining whether these conditions are satisfied, the court must have regard to the 
definitions in s 447(1), (4)—(8), and (11) of POCA. S 447(8) of POCA defines 'criminal 
conduct' to include conduct that is criminal in the UK and conduct which would be 
criminal if it had been committed in the UK. 
It follows that the Crown Court can make a restraint order under the POCA Order at the A.7.617 
request of a foreign state provided that the conduct alleged would have been criminal in the 
UK at the time it was committed. Unlike in the case of domestic restraint and confiscation 
orders made under Part 2 of POCA, the POCA Order is not restricted to offences 
committed after 24 March 2003, or after the date it came into force, because it does not 
contain any equivalent of Arts 3 and 5 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Commence-
ment No. 5, Transitional Provisions, Savings and Amendment) Order 2003,1 and s 447(7) 
of POCA does not restrict the meaning of 'criminal conduct' to conduct occurring after 
any particular date. 
SI 2003/333. 
Thus, the UK can grant assistance and the court can make a restraint order in relation to an 
offence whenever it was committed.' The application is usually made without notice 
although there is an obligation to make material disclosure.2

(iii) Definitions 
The POCA Order uses the following terms: 
• External request this is a request by an overseas authority to prohibit dealing with 
relevant property which is identified in the request.' 
• Relevant properry: property is relevant property if there are reasonable grounds to believe 
that it may be needed to satisfy an external order which has been or which may be made.2
• External order: this is an order which is made by an overseas court where property is 
found or believed to have been obtained as a result of or in connection with criminal 
conduct, and is for the recovery of specified property or a specified sum of money)

A.7.620 Art 6(1) of the POCA Order provides that except where Art 6(2) applies, the Secretary of 
State may refer an external request in connection with criminal investigations or proceed-
ings in the country from which the request was made and concerning relevant property in

State that the request is made in connection with criminal investigations or proceedings 
which relate to an offence involving serious or complex fraud, and concerns relevant 
property in England or Wales, then the Secretary of State may refer the request to the 
Director of the SFO to process it.I

A.7.622 In the POCA Order 'the relevant Director' means the Director to whom an external request 
is referred under Art 6(1) or 6(3). By An 6(5) the relevant Director may ask the overseas 
authority which made the request for such further information as may be necessary to 
determine whether the request is likely to satisfy either of the conditions in Art 7. A request 
under Art 6(5) may include a request for statements which may be used as evidence. 
A.7.623 Where a request concerns relevant property which is in Scotland or Northern Ireland as 
well as England or Wales, so much of the request as concerns such property is to be dealt 
with under Part 3 or 4 of the POCA Order, respectively. 
(v) The Crown Courts power to make a restraint order at the request 
of a foreign state 
A.7.624 The Crown Court's powers to make a restraint order pursuant to an external request are 
contained in Chapter 1 of Part 2 of the POCA Order. Art 8 provides that the Crown Court 
may make a restraint order if either condition in Art 7 is satisfied. 
A.7.625 Art 7(4) provides that in determining whether the conditions in Art 7 are satisfied and 
whether the request is an external request within the meaning of POCA, the court must 
have regard to the definitions in s 447(1), (4)—(8), and (11). Evidence must not be excluded 
in restraint proceedings on the grounds that it is hearsay evidence.t

• S 447(1) provides that an external request is a request by an overseas authority to prohibit 
dealing with relevant property which is identified in the request.' 
• S 447(4)—(8) provides as follows. Property is all property, wherever situated,2 and 
includes money; all forms of property, real or personal, heritable or moveable; things in 
action and other intangible or incorporeal property (s 447(4)). Property is obtained by a 
person if he obtains an interest in it (s 447(5)). References to an interest, in relation to 
property other than land, include references to a right (including a right to possession) 
(s 447(6)). Property is relevant property if there are reasonable grounds to believe that it 
may be needed to satisfy an external order which has been or which may be made 
(s 447(7)). Criminal conduct is conduct which constitutes an offence in any part of the 
UK, or would constitute an offence in any part of the UK if it occurred there (s 447(8)). 
• S 447(11) provides that an overseas authority is an authority which has responsibility in 
a country or territory outside the UK for making a request to an authority in another 
country or territory (including the UK) to prohibit dealing with relevant property; for 
carrying out an investigation into whether property has been obtained as a result of or in 
connection with criminal conduct; or for carrying out an investigation into whether a 
money laundering offence has been committed. 
The Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (External Requests and Orders) (Amendment) Order 2013/2604 (in 
force II November 2013) makes provision for the obtaining by an 'enforcement authority✓ (as to which 
see An 141 R) to obtain from the High Court (in England, Wales, or Northern Ireland) or the Court of 
Session (in Scotland) a prohibition order to prevent dealing with relevant property in the UK which is 
the subject of an external request. within the meaning of s 447(1) of POCA.The provisions (new Pts 4A 
and 4B inserted into the External Requests Order 2005) correspond (subject to specified modifications) 
to the civil recovery provisions in POCA. Overseas requests that are criminal in nature will continue to 
be dealt with through the provisions in the CICA 2003. 
In the context of the POCA Order, this means wherever situated in the UK: IGngv Serious Fraud Office

(I) The Article 7 conditions 
Art 8 of the POCA Order provides that the Crown Court may make a restraint order it A.7.627 
either condition in Art 7 is satisfied. 
The first condition in Art 7 is that relevant property in England and Wales' is identified in A.7.628 
the external request; a criminal investigation has been started in the country from which the 
external request was made with regard to an offence; and there is reasonable cause to believe 
that the alleged offender named in the request has benefited from his criminal conduct. 
For property situated in Scotland or Northern Ireland, Pts 3-4 of the POCA Order contain correspond-
ing provisions. The order may only extend to property situated in the UK: King "Serious Fraud Office 
(2009) 1 WLR 718, pars 36-38, HL. 
The second condition in Art 7 is that relevant properly in England and Wales' is identified A.7.629 
in the external request; proceedings for an offence have been started in the country from 
which the external request was made and not concluded; and there is reasonable cause to 
believe that the defendant named in the request has benefited from his criminal conduct.

Chapter A7: Mutual Legal Assistance in Cases of Fraud 
(2) Procedure 
A.7.630 The procedure for applying for a restraint order is set out in Rule 33.12 and 
Rules 33.51-33.55 of the Criminal Procedure Rules 2015.1 The application must be in 
writing and be supported by a witness statement which must give the grounds for the 
application; give full details of the realisable property in respect of which the applicant is 
seeking the order and specify the person holding that realisable property; and give the 
grounds for, and full details of, any application for an ancillary order under Art 8(4) for the 
purposes of ensuring that the restraint order is effective. 
SI 2015/1490. in force 5 October 2015. 
A.7.631 The court is required to have regard to the legislative steer contained in Art 46 which 
requires it to have regard to the need to preserve the value for the time being of realisable 
property or specified property so that it can be made available for satisfying an external 
order. No account is to be taken of any obligation of a defendant or a recipient of a tainted 
gift if the obligation conflicts with the object of satisfying any external order against the 
defendant that has been or may be registered under Art 22. 
A.7.632 However the court's powers must be exercised with a view to allowing a person other than 
the defendant or a recipient of a tainted gift to retain or recover the value of any interest 
held by him. In the case of realisable property or specified property held by a recipient of a 
tainted gift, the powers must be exercised with a view to realising no more than the value 
for the time being of the gift. 
A.7.633 An application to discharge or vary a restraint order may be made under Art 9. Arts 10 and 
provide a right of appeal to the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court against a refusal 
to grant a restraint order, an order made under Art 8(4), and a decision made on an 
application to vary or discharge the order under Art 9(2). Through oversight, the POCA 
Order was not originally amended by the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 so as to 
substitute Supreme Court for House of Lords. That was remedied in 20111 and the 
Supreme Court held in Start rd International Bank Ltd. (acting by its joint liquidaton) v 
Director of the Serious baud Dffice2 that appeals lie to the Supreme Court in respect of 
Court of Appeal decisions made prior to the commencement of the 2011 Order (6 June 
2011).

A.7.634 Unlike conventional POCA restraint orders, 1 under Art 11 to the POCA Order there also 
existed no requirement of leave or certification for appeals to the Supreme Court. Thus 
there existed an absolute, unqualified right of appeal to the Supreme Court against the 
making of an external restraint order. That too was remedied, as from 29 February 2012, by

imposes, amongst other things, certification and leave requirements in respect of appeals 
concerning external restraint orders.2 However, the 2012 Order does not have retroactive

particularly having regard to the requirement in rule 33.12 that the rules are to apply 'with the necessary

By Art 12, if a restraint order is in force, a constable or a relevant officer of Revenue and A.7.635 
Customs may seize any property which is specified in it to prevent its removal from 
England and Wales. Any property so seized must be dealt with in accordance with the 
court's directions. 
The court may appoint a management receiver under Art 15 who may then exercise the A.7.636 
powers specified in Art 16 in relation to property specified in the order. 
(vi) The Crown Courts' power to enforce an external order 
The Crown Court's power to enforce an external order is contained in Chapter 2 of Part 2 A.7.637 
of the POCA Order. There are three principal stages in the enforcement of such an order: 
• reference to the Director of the appropriate prosecution agency by the Secretary of State; 
• application by the relevant Director to the Crown Court for the registration of the order; 
• enforcement of the order by the relevant Director. Art 27 also allows for the appointment 
of an enforcement receiver to manage the property and to realize it in satisfaction of the 
confiscation order in accordance with Art 28. 
The first step in the enforcement of an external order following its receipt from a foreign A.7.638 
state is its referral to the Director of Public Prosecutions. Art 18(1) provides that, except 
where Art 18(2) applies (cases of serious and complex fraud), the Secretary of State may 
refer an external order arising from a criminal conviction in the country from which the 
order was sent and concerning relevant property in England and Wales' to the DPP.2 In a 
case falling under Art 18(2) the order may be referred to the Director of the SFO.3
I BY An 18(5), where an order concerns relevant property which is in Scotland or Northern Ireland swell
as England or Wales. so much of the request as concerns such properly shall be dealt with under Pt 3 or 
of the POCA Order 2005. respectively.

Chapter A7: Mutual Legal Assistance in Cases of Fraud 
A.7.639 Following a reference by the Secretary of State, the relevant Director may apply to the 
Crown Court to give effect to the external order under Art 20(1). The request may be ex 
parte to a judge in chambers and must include a request that the relevant Director be 
appointed as the enforcement authority for the order. 
(I) Conditions forgiving den to an external order 
A.7.640 By Art 21 of the FOCA Order, the Crown Court must decide to give effect to the external 
order by registering it where all of the following conditions are satisfied. 
A.7.641 The first condition is that the external order was made consequent on the conviction of the 
person named in the order and no appeal is outstanding in respect of that conviction. 
A.7.642 The second condition is that the external order is in force and no appeal is outstanding in 
respect of it. 
A.7.643 The third condition is that giving effect to the external order would not be incompatible 
with the Convention rights (within the meaning of the Human Rights Act 1998) of any 
person affected by it.' In Government ofthe United States ofAmerica v Montgomery (No 2)2 
the House of Lords considered whether the enforcement of an external order would violate 
the defendants Convention rights. Their Lordships held that it could do so, but only in an 
exceptional case where there would be a flagrant denial of justice3 (which was not the case 
on the facts).

On the meaning of this phrase see Othmon v United Kingdom (2012) 55 EHRR I. 
A.7.644 The fourth condition applies only in respect of an external order which authorizes the 
confiscation of property other than money that is specified in the order. In such a case, the 
specified property must not be subject to a charge under the legislation specified in 
Art 21(6). 
A.7.645 In determining whether the order is an external order within the meaning of the FOCA the 
court must have regard to the definitions in s 447(2), (4), (5), (6), (8), and (10).1
ROCA Order, An 21(7). 
A.7.646 By Art 22, where the Crown Court decides to give effect to an external order it must register 
the order in that court; provide for the notice of the registration to be given to any person 
affected by it; and appoint the relevant Director as the enforcement authority for the order. 
A.7.647 The Crown Court may cancel the registration of the external order, or vary the property to 
which it applies, on an application by the relevant Director or any person affected by it if 
or to the extent that the court is of the opinion that any of the conditions in Art 21 are not 
satisfied.' The court must cancel the registration of the external order on such an 
application if it appears that the order has been satisfied by payment of the amount due

Arts 23 and 24 provide a right of appeal to the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court' A.7.648 
against a refusal to register an external confiscation order or a refusal to cancel or vary it. 
I So far as appeal to the Supreme Court under Alt 24 is concerned. the relevant amendments were made 
by the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 (Consequential Amendments) Order 2011 (SI 2011/1242): as 
to the effect of which, see Sanford International Bank Ltd (acting by its joint liquidators) v Ditretorofthe 
Serious Fraud Office 12012) UKSC 3. discussed above at pan A.7.633. 
Art 26 contains provisions for the time within which money specified in the external order A.7.649 
must be paid. 
(vii) Orders which may be made in addition to and in aid of restraint orders 
and external orders 
By Art 8(4) of the POCA Order the Crown Court may make such orders as it believes are A.7.650-700 
appropriate for the purpose of ensuring the restraint order is effective.' Examples of such 
orders that have been granted in domestic restraint cases include: 
• a disclosure order requiring the defendant to swear an affidavit as to the whereabouts of 
his assets:2 
• an order for cross-examination on the defendant's disclosure affidavit, This power 
should only be used in exceptional circumstances where there are justifiable concerns 
over whether the defendant has given full disclosure of his assets.4 The only legitimate 
purpose of the cross-examination is to establish the extent of a defendant's assets, and 
hence would be unnecessary if sufficient assets are known about to meet the claim :5 
• an order requiring the defendant to repatriate his assets;6 
• an order for the delivery up of the defendant's passport.'

or otherwise deal with it; the power to start, carry on, or defend legal proceedings in 
connection with the property; and the power to realise the property to meet the receiver's

The procedure for obtaining a restraint order in the Crown Court and for enforcing an A.7.709 
external order is contained in Rule 33.12 of the Criminal Procedure Rules 2015.1 Rule 
33.12 provides that the rules in Parts 33 and 42 apply with the necessary modifications to 
proceedings under the POCA Order in the same way that they apply to corresponding 
proceedings under Part 2 of POCA.2 Rule 33.12 contains a useful table showing how 
provisions of the 2005 Order correspond to provisions of the 2002 Act. 
I SI 2015/1490, in force 5 October 2015. 
See T Moloney and D Atkinson, Blarlatone's Guide to the Criminal hortatory Ralf 2010 (2010). 
(x) Remitting confiscated property to the requesting state 
Property (or its equivalent in money) recovered under a foreign confiscation or forfeiture A.7.710 
order in the UK is not automatically transmitted to the foreign enforcement authority or 
state. Property (or its equivalent in money) recovered under a foreign confiscation order is 
placed in the UK Government's Consolidated Fund.' There is no legal power which enables 
the UK court to remit the property to a foreign state or other recipient. Forfeited property, 
in England and Wales, is disposed of at the direction of the High Court, which must give 
persons holding any interest in the property in question a 'reasonable opportunity' to make 
representations to the court. 
I In the someway, where the UK seeks the assistance of a foreign stare in enforcing a domestic confiscation 
order under POCA, s 74, any property recovered in the foreign state falls to be dealt with under that 
states law and is not automatically remitted to the UK: POCA, s 74(3). 
The UK has entered into agreements with Canada+ and the US2 to determine the ultimate 
destination of property or sums of money confiscated (in the UK, as defined by UK law) or 
forfeited (in Canada or the US). These agreements permit the UK to share property (or an 
equivalent amount of money) confiscated in the UK with the requesting state.

the Sharing of Forfeited or Confiscated Assets or their Equivalent Funds. signed in London on 21

[A.7.713] 
Chapter A7: Mutual Legal Assistance in Cases of Fraud 
A.7.713 Where there is no such agreement the foreign state must request the remittance of property 
or sums of money on a diplomatic basis. If the requesting state is one which itself would 
remit property or sums of money, which it recovers in its own procedures, this is likely to 
give rise to a diplomatic expectation of reciprocal remittance from the UK. Where it is the 
case that remittance is requested by a foreign state on the basis that the property and or 
money would, if remitted, be returned to a victim or paid as compensation to a victim of 
crime, the request for remittance has more force still. The UK Central Authority deals with 
these requests and may agree to remit a portion of funds recovered (after itself obtaining the 
approval of the Treasury). MI other funds recovered are paid to the Consolidated Fund and 
are not remitted to other states or persons. 
(d) Foreign requests for assistance in gathering evidence in relation 
to confiscation 
(i) Investigations using powers in the Crime (International Co-operation) Art 2003 
A.7.714 The methods by which assistance may be provided by the UK to foreign states in relation 
to evidence gathering have been summarized in earlier chapters. These powers are available 
for use in relation to restraint and confiscation investigations. In summary, the powers 
available under CICA 2003 and other statutes include: 
• search and seizure warrants: warrants authorising an appropriate person to enter and 
search specified premises and to seize and retain any material found there which is likely 
to be of substantial value to the civil recovery investigation;' 
• production orders: orders requiring a specified person appearing to be in possession or 
control of material to produce it to an appropriate officer for him to take away, or 
requiring a specified person to give an appropriate officer access to the material:2
• voluntary and compulsory interviews; 
• proceedings before a nominated court:4
• customer information orders: orders requiring financial institutions to provide certain 
information in relation to a specified customer of the institution;s 
• account monitoring orders: orders requiring financial institutions to provide certain 
account information in relation to an account held by the financial institution.6

(ii) Investigations using powers in the proceeds of Crime Act 2002 
Prior to the enactment of POCA 2002 there were different statutory provisions dealing A.7.715 
with investigations in drugs and non-drugs cases) However, the investigatory powers 
contained in POCA apply to 'criminal conduct' and 'unlawful conduct' generally, and 
these expressions include any conduct that constitutes an offence or is unlawful in any part 
of the UK, or would constitute an offence or be unlawful in any part of the UK if it 
occurred there.2 
I Criminal Justice Act 1988. ss 931, 9314 (non-drugs); Drug Trafficking Act 1994. ss 55 and 56 (drugs): 
see generally R v Crown Court at Southwark ex p Bowles (19981 AC 641. 
POCA. ss 241(2). 413(1), s 447(8). 
Part 8 of POCA is entitled 'Investigations and Chapter 2 contains an extensive range of A.7.716 
investigatory powers including search warrants and production orders for use in tracing the 
proceeds of crime and money laundering investigations in England and Wales. S 445(1) 
provides that Her Majesty may by Order in Council make provision to enable orders 
equivalent to those under Part 8 to be made, and warrants equivalent to those under Part 8 
to be issued, for the purposes of an 'external investigation', and make provision creating 
offences in relation to external investigations which are equivalent to offences created by 
Part 8 ands 435B. 
An 'external investigation is defined in s 447(3) to be an investigation by an overseas A.7.717 
authority into whether property has been obtained as a result of or in connection with 
criminal conduct; the extent or whereabouts of property obtained as a result of or in 
connection with criminal conduct; or whether a money laundering offence has been 
committed. 
Two Orders have been made thus far: the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (External Investi- A.7.718 
gations) Order 20131 (re civil recovery investigations) and the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 
(External Investigations) Order 2014 (other investigations)? Both Orders make provisions 
to assist external investigations by way of orders and warrants from the court. Neither 
Order encompasses external money laundering investigations) 
I The Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (External Investigations) Order 2013, SI 2013/2605 (in force I 1 
November 2013) makes provision to assist an external investigation, within the meaning of s 447(3) of 
POCA, by obtaining orders and warrants from thecourr.The provisions correspond (subject to specified 
modifications) to the civil recovery investigation provisions in Pt 8 of POCA. Overseas requests to 
investigate that are criminal in nature will continue to be dealt with through the provisions in the CICA 
2003. Article 35 applies the domestic codes of practice that govern POCA. Pt 8 (see SI 2018/84 and SI 
2018/93) to external civil recovery investigations. 
The Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (External Investigations) Order 2014. SI 2014/1893 complements SI 
2013/2605 and makes further provision to assist an external investigation, within the meaning of s 
447(3) of POCA, by obtaining orders and warrants from the court. The provisions again correspond 
(subject to specified modifications) to confiscation investigation provisions in Pt 8 of POCA. Article 35 
applies the domestic codes of practice that govern POCA. Pc 8 (see SI 2018184 and SI 2018193) to 
external investigations.

Interviews 
Appointment of investigator and confidentiality of information 
Under section 169(1)(b) and section 131FA of the Act, the FCA may appoint 
an investigator to investigate any matter at the request of an overseas 
regulator or EEA regulator. The powers of the investigator appointed by the 
FCA (referred to here as the 'FCA's investigator') include the power to 
require persons to attend at a specified time and place and answer questions 
(the compulsory interview power). 
Where the FCA appoints an investigator in response to a request from an 
overseas regulator or EEA regulator it may, under section 169(7) or section 
131FA of the Act, direct him to permit a representative of that regulator to 
attend and take part in any interviews conducted for the purposes of the 
investigation. The FCA may only give a direction under section 169(7) or 
section 131FA if it is satisfied that any information obtained by an overseas 
regulator or EEA regulator as a result of the interview will be subject to the 
safeguards equivalent to those contained in Part XXIII (Public Record, 
Disclosure of Information and Cooperation) of the Act. 
Part XXIII of the Act contains restrictions on the disclosure of confidential 
information. The restrictions are subject to exceptions contained in 
regulations made by the Treasury under section 349. 
Policy on use of investigative powers 
The FCA's policy on how it will use its investigative powers, including its 
power to appoint investigators, in support of overseas regulators and EEA 
regulators, is set out in the FCA's Enforcement Guide (EG). 
Use of direction powers 
The FCA may need to consider whether to use its direction power at two 
stages of an investigation: 
(1) at the same time that it considers the request from the overseas 
regulator or EEA regulator to appoint investigators; 
(2) after it has appointed investigators, either at the request of the 
overseas regulator or EEA regulator or on the recommendation of the 
investigators.

G 
Before making a direction under section 169(7) or section 131FA the FCA will 
discuss and determine with the overseas regulator or EEA regulator how this 
statement of policy will apply to the conduct of the interview, taking into 
account all the circumstances of the case. Amongst other matters, the FCA 
will at this stage determine the extent to which the representative of the 
overseas regulator or EEA regulator will be able to participate in the 
interview. The overseas regulator or EEA regulator will be notified of this 
determination on the issuing of the direction. 
The direction will contain the identity of the representative of the overseas 
regulator or EEA regulator that is permitted to attend any interview and the 
role that he will play in the interview. If the FCA envisages that there will be 
more than one interview in the course of the investigation, the direction 
may also specify which interview(s) the representative is allowed to attend. 
Conduct of interview 
In circumstances where an interview is to be conducted as part of the 
investigation, the FCA's investigator will have conduct of the interview. In 
general, the FCA's investigators will be employees of the FCA, but in 
appropriate cases the FCA may appoint persons who are not its employees. 
In those cases, the FCA may choose to require that an FCA employee is 
present at the interview and may choose to appoint that person as an 
investigator. 
The FCA's investigator will act on behalf of the FCA and under its control. He 
may be instructed to permit the representative of the overseas regulator or 
EEA regulator to assist in the preparation of the interview. Where the FCA 
considers it appropriate, it may permit the representative to attend and ask 
questions of the interviewee in the course of the interview. The interview 
will be conducted according to the terms of the direction and the 
notification referred to in ■ DEPP 7.2.6 G. 
If the direction does permit the representative of an overseas regulator or 
EEA regulator to attend the interview and ask the interviewee questions, the 
FCA's investigator will retain control of the interview throughout. Control of 
the interview means the following will apply: 
(1) The FCA's investigator instigates and concludes the interview, 
introduces everyone present and explains the procedure of the 
interview. He warns the interviewee of the possible consequences of 
refusing to answer questions and the uses to which any answers that 
are given can and cannot be put. The FCA's investigator will always 
ask preliminary questions, such as those establishing the identity of 
the interviewee. 
(2) The FCA's investigator determines the duration of the interview and 
when, if at all, there should be any breaks in the course of it. 
(3) The FCA's investigator has responsibility for making a record of the 
interview. The record should note the times and duration of any 
breaks in the interview and any periods when the representative of 
the overseas regulator or EEA regulator was either present or not 
present.

(4) Where the FCA's investigator considers it appropriate, he may either 
suspend the interview, ask the overseas representative to leave the 
interview, or terminate the interview and reschedule it for another 
occasion. In making that decision he will bear in mind the terms of 
the direction, any agreement made with the overseas regulator or 
EEA regulator as to the conduct of the interview and the contents of 
this statement of policy. 
The FCA will in general provide written notice of the appointment of an 
investigator to the person under investigation pursuant to the request of an 
overseas regulator or EEA regulator. Whether or not the interviewee is the 
person under investigation, the FCA's investigator will inform the 
interviewee of the provisions under which he has been appointed, the 
identity of the requesting authority and general nature of the matter under 
investigation. The interviewee will also normally be informed if a 
representative of the overseas regulator or EEA regulator is to attend and 
take part in the interview. Notification of any of these matters may not be 
provided in advance of the interview if the FCA believes that the 
circumstances are such that notification would be likely to result in the 
investigation being frustrated. 
The interviewee will normally be given a copy of the direction issued under 
section 169(7) or section 131FA in advance of the interview unless to do so 
would be likely to result in the investigation being frustrated. The 
interviewee will also be provided with a copy of this statement of policy. 
The FCA's investigator will determine the venue and timing of the interview. 
The interviewee will be notified of the venue and timing of the interview in 
advance and in writing. 
When the FCA's investigator has exercised the compulsory interview power, 
at the outset of the interview the interviewee will be given an appropriate 
warning. The warning, amongst other things, must state that the 
interviewee is obliged to answer all questions put to them during the 
interview, including any put by the representative of the overseas regulator 
or EEA regulator. It will also state that in criminal proceedings or 
proceedings for market abuse the FCA will not use as evidence against the 
interviewee any information obtained under compulsion during the 
interview. 
The FCA's investigator may decide which documents or other information 
may be put to the interviewee, and whether it is appropriate to give the 
interviewee sight of the documents before the interview takes place. Where 
the overseas regulator or EEA regulator wishes to ask questions about 
documents during the interview and the FCA's investigator wishes to inspect 
those documents before the interview, he will be given the opportunity to 
do so. If the FCA's investigator wishes to inspect them and has not been able 
to do so before the interview, he may suspend the interview until he has had 
an opportunity to inspect them. 
When the FCA's investigator has exercised the compulsory interview power, 
the FCA's investigator will require the person attending the interview to

Section 7.2 : Interviews

g

answer questions. Where appropriate, questions may also be posed by the 
representative of the overseas regulator or EEA regulator. The interviewee 
will also be required to answer these questions. The FCA's investigator may 
intervene at any stage during questioning by the representative of the 
overseas regulator or EEA regulator. 
Language
Interviews will, in general, be conducted in English. Where the interviewee's 
first language is not English, at the request of the interviewee arrangements 
will be made for the questions to be translated into the interviewee's first 
language and for his answers to be translated back into English. If a 
translator is employed at the request of the representative of the overseas 
regulator or EEA regulator then the translation costs will normally be met by 
the overseas regulator or EEA regulator. Where interviews are being 
conducted in pursuance of an EU law obligation these costs will be met by 
the FCA. In any event, the meeting of costs in relation to translators and, 
where applicable, the translation of documents will always be agreed in 
advance with the overseas regulator or EEA regulator. 
Tape-recording 
All compulsory interviews will be tape-recorded. The method of recording 
will be decided on and arranged by the FCA's investigator. Costs will be 
addressed similarly to that set out in the preceding paragraph. The FCA will 
not provide the overseas regulator or EEA regulator with transcripts of the 
tapes of interviews unless specifically agreed to, but copies of the tapes will 
normally be provided where requested. The interviewee will be provided 
with a copy of tapes of the interview but will only be provided with 
transcripts of the tapes or translations of any transcripts if he agrees to meet 
the cost of producing them. 
Representation
The interviewee may be accompanied at the interview by a legal adviser or a 
non-legally qualified observer of his choice. The costs of any representation 
will not be met by the FCA. The presence at the interview of a representative 
of the overseas regulator or EEA regulator may mean that the interviewee 
wishes to be represented or accompanied by a person either from or familiar 
with that regulator's jurisdiction. As far as practical the arrangements for the 
interview should accommodate this wish. However, the FCA reserves the 
right to proceed with the interview if it is not possible to find such a person 
within a reasonable time or no such person is able to attend at a suitable 
venue. 
In relation to the publication of investigations by overseas regulators or EEA 
regulators, the FCA will pursue a policy similar to the policy that relates to its 
own investigations.

Just to clarify, would it be possible for you to provide us even a very general or high-level summary of what she has told 
you? We ordinarily don't go into interviews completely blind when witnesses have counsel — and the Weinstein

Thanks 
I am afraid that an attorney proffer will not be possible. I have been working with the DA in New York on the Weinstein 
case and have simply offered up my clients to questions which has worked well. 
I am of course happy to speak over the phone but it seems to me that you are better off getting the information first hand. If 
you wish it may be sensible for you to initially have a call with my client? 
My client has made a complaint to the Met police regarding a sexual assault by Jeffrey Epstein whilst in London and in the 
employment of G Maxwell. Apart from the complaint itself, no further information has been provided to the police. 
I appreciate the issue re coronavirus of course.

That's great, thank you for letting us know, and we'll check on that right away and get back to you as soon as possible. 
The only wrinkle, which unfortunately is completely beyond our control, is that there is now some talk of government 
international travel being prevented due to the coronavirus situation, but we'll talk to the relevant people here 
immediately. 
One thing that would be extremely helpful for us in the near-term, including in terms of getting approvals here — and we 
talked about this on the phone as well — would be to get an attorney proffer about your understanding of generally what 
information you expect your client will convey on the subjects we've spoken about? We completely understand that it's 
best to have her tell her story directly to us, but in terms of our preparation it's often very useful for both us and the

We wanted to quickly follow up since I think you and I last spoke a little over a week ago—understand if you are still 
discussing with your client, just wanted to check in, and we're happy to provide any additional information that might be 
useful, as always.

No problem at all, we understand this takes time, and we appreciate you getting back to us, and we're very grateful that 
your client is open to speaking with us. 
On your questions, we are certainly fine with the first two questions / requests — we're happy to meet with you and your 
client in an initial conversation, during which we can do the kind of introductions and explanations we've done with you 
(and that we do with all victim witnesses we meet), including answering any questions to the best of our ability, and 
then to take a break and have a more substantive discussion later on. 
Regarding the friend, does that individual also represent her as counsel? We aren't normally able to include individuals 
in addition to the witness and counsel in an interview—what does sometimes work is for someone who is providing 
support (a parent, friend, etc.) to be close by for any discussions, assistance, etc. anytime that a witness wants to speak 
with that person, which would of course be totally fine in this instance. Or if he represents her in his capacity as an 
attorney then he of course could be in the interview in that role (with the only caveat that we would just want to 
confirm that he himself is not separately a witness of some sort in the case). We unfortunately are not able to pay for 
third parties (including counsel) to travel in connection with witness interviews, though — if it's preferable, we certainly 
could pay for your client's travel to the U.S. for the interview, including airfare and lodging, if that makes it easier for the 
friend to be present? And we're happy to discuss any of this further by email or phone if that's useful — I'll be at my 
desk for the next several hours and most of tomorrow, at 
or we could also set a time to chat, whatever 
would be helpful. 
thank you,

Hello 
I
.
Apologies for the slight delay. My client is willing to help but asks the following: 
• 
That there be a morning meeting at which introductions with a discussion as to the investigation and my clients 
involvement. I appreciate that you have explained this to me but I think further verbal clarification would assist. 
• 
In the afternoon and after a break, my client would be willing to answer questions, in so far as she can. 
• 
That a friend of hers be allowed to be present as well. However that friend is based in the US and would need to 
be flown over to London. He is a US lawyer. 
Perhaps you could let me know if this is possible? 
Kind regards, 
Jill

Following up on our phone call, thank you for talking with us again, and we wanted to get back to you regarding some 
of the additional follow-up questions you asked, and to describe in more detail for your client how we would expect to 
approach any discussion with your client if she were comfortable meeting with us. 
The absolute most important thing is that any discussion would be entirely voluntary, and by that we mean the 
decision to meet with us but also as to any topic or question—your client would be absolutely free to determine what 
topics she felt comfortable discussing. There is absolutely no pressure on victim witnesses to address anything that 
would make them uncomfortable at any time, and even if your client was willing to meet with us, we would tell her, as 
we do for any witness, that if any topic comes up that she wants to skip, or discuss with you privately, that is no 
problem at all. 
In fact, if you and she would prefer, we would be happy to have a meeting where we simply introduced ourselves, 
explained the status of our investigation, talked about how a discussion would proceed if your client ended up being 
comfortable with that, and answered in person any questions she. We have done that previously, where we do the 
talking rather than asking questions in an initial meeting, and that would of course be without any requirement for 
anything additional if she preferred not to. As I mentioned on the phone, we have consistently found that we are able 
to reassure individuals when we have the opportunity to meet in person so they can see directly our interest in 
approaching these discussions with great sensitivity and care. As I also mentioned on the phone, even if your client 
were willing to speak with us, there would be absolutely no need or requirement for her to talk about any assault or 
victimization she experienced. We wrote in our first email that we would primarily be interested in talking about 
topics such as the general scope of her employment, directions she received from Epstein or Maxwell, etc., and as 
always we would be guided by her comfort level. 
In terms of who would attend a meeting, we almost always work in pairs, so two prosecutors and two officers, and 
that's not to have extra people, but rather because it helps us to be as efficient as we can, and so witnesses can meet 
the people on the team. Our team is also majority female, and we always tell witnesses that if topics come up in a 
discussion that they would prefer to speak about just with women, that's fine and we can be flexible in the moment 
and are always guided by the comfort level of the victim. But I also want to stress that in terms of your client in 
particular, we don't expect to initially address issues of a very personal or sexual nature, and we certainly would tell 
you in advance if there came a time when we thought that might be important to address, and how we could facilitate 
that. Who exactly from our team would be at any meeting would depend on schedules, but we can assure you that 
every one of us has now spoken with dozens of victims in this case, and every one of us has extensive experience more 
generally working with victims and working on cases involving sex offenses. We are proud of how we have been able 
to work with victims in this case especially, given all of the circumstances, and we absolutely would take the same 
sensitive approach with your client as we have with the many other victims in this case who have spoken with us. 
EFTA00022312
--- PAGE 7 ---
Again, if it would be helpful even for us to just come to the U.K. and introduce ourselves and explain in person how our 
process works, and answer any questions your client has in person, we would absolutely be happy to do that with no 
obligation at all from her. We also could do that with the possibility that if she felt comfortable, we could just address 
the general subject of her employment, for example. But no obligation and no pressure. We continue to appreciate 
your and her willingness to even broach the possibility of a discussion, and we hope this is helpful. 
thank you very much,

Subject: RE: Epstein investigation 
Thanks for circling back, and we'll do our best to answer these questions. In terms of who would be in the room, the 
most likely answer is that it would be two of the prosecutors and the two law enforcement officers on the case. The 
only reason I saw "most likely" rather than having a definitive answer is that when we're interviewing in a foreign 
country, it sometimes is the case the local law enforcement also insists on having representatives present. I don't 
believe that's required in the U.K., but we can check on it and give you a definitive answer in the coming days if that's 
useful. (Also, if she preferred to be interviewed in the U.S., we certainly could guarantee that the room would be just 
the case team, and we could arrange for travel and lodging for her. Let us know if that's the case, but otherwise we're 
of course happy to travel to her.) 
Regarding access to notes, it would principally be the investigative team—so again, the prosecutors and the FBI team 
working on the case. Our respective supervisors also theoretically have access to our files, but the reports are not 
generally widely disseminated. The basic logistics are that an agent takes notes during an interview, and then types up 
those notes into a formal report (called an FBI Form 302). We don't ordinarily share notes with other entities, but I 
can also check on that to see if I can make a more specific representation with respect to your client. 
With respect to anonymity, I confess that I'm not familiar with the distinction you're referring to. In terms of our 
investigation, we don't publicly disclose the names of individuals we meet with, and we don't disclose to any other 
witnesses, for example, the identities of victims or witnesses we are meeting with. (And our policies on that don't 
change even for individuals who are in the position of your client, who have been widely publicly reported to have 
been connected to Epstein and/or his employees or associates). But if that doesn't answer your question, we're of 
course happy to discuss further. Let me know if it might be useful to have a call? Or if not, also happy to address any 
follow-up via email. 
thanks,

Hi 
Thanks for this. I've been asked who would be in the room and thereafter who would have access to any 
notes made. Would her permission be sought before disclosing to any other parties or officials? 
As you know there is a real difficulty in relation to her anonymity in the US versus the UK. Are you able to 
provide any comfort on this? 
Many thanks

Thank you again for speaking with us earlier today regarding our interest in talking with your client in connection 
with our investigation into the conduct of Jeffrey Epstein. 
As requested, we wanted to briefly memorialize our current views and understandings of your client, and also to 
reiterate our interest in approaching any discussion with great care and sensitivity, particularly to avoid adding to her 
trauma or causing re-victimization. 
As we mentioned on the phone, your client is not a target of our investigation—it sounds like the analogue in the 
U.K. may be the "suspect" category—and we currently do not have reason to believe that she has committed any 
U.S. federal crime. As we discussed, our knowledge of your client specifically is somewhat limited, having never 
spoken to her—and therefore knowing about her only through other witnesses and records—but it certainly has 
been our experience that the overwhelming majority of young women and girls who were in the orbit of Jeffrey 
Epstein during the relevant periods were subject to his abuse. It does not surprise us, nor do we have any trouble 
believing, that your client was similarly a victim. I hope that is helpful in understanding the capacity in which we 
hope to speak with her. 
Separately, and as we also discussed, any discussion with our team would be entirely voluntary—and that extends 
not just to whether she would be willing to meet with us at all, but also including her ability to decline to discuss 
particular topics or even particular questions, and to talk with her counsel at any time, to take any breaks that would 
be beneficial while we're meeting, etc. 
In terms of topic areas, we would be hoping to learn about the general narrative of her interactions with Epstein and 
his other associates and employees, including Ghislaine Maxwell, whom we understand she may have worked 
EFTA00022314
--- PAGE 9 ---
directly for. That would broadly include how she came to be in contact with them, the nature and scope of her 
employment, any instructions she was given relating to other women or girls, and just generally her experiences and 
observations in interacting with them. We ordinarily would also be interested in understanding the general nature of 
the abuse she was subjected to, but I want to emphasize that we would not need to discuss with her the specifics if 
she weren't comfortable with that, and in particular we often don't even broach that subject in a first meeting. 
Please let us know if you have any additional questions, and in particular whether any other information from us 
would be useful, and we look forward to speaking with you again soon.

Hey., 
I know you're traveling, but when you get a chance, could you please let me know if you ever received a subpoena return 
for the attached AT&T subpoena? I'm working onMchecking all al and court subpoena returns, and I've found a few 
other returns for two other AT&T court subpoenas, though not this one. Please let me know when you can, thank youl

Thanks for this, it's a helpful start. In terms of being able to write our search warrant, one additional piece of information 
we need is the serial number, or some other specific identifier, ideally for each device but at least for any device that there 
is more than one of the same thing. So for example, we need to be able to somehow differentiate the following devices — 
The two Dell power edge T310 hard drives (NYCO24323 and NYCO24324) 
The two Sony Vaio laptop / Fujitsu hdd (NYCO24336 and NYCO24337) 
the following loose storage devices: 
o Micro SD card (NYCO24339) 
o Flash Drive (generic) (NYCO24340) 
o Thumbdrive (Emtec) (NYCO24341) 
o hard drive (loose) (NYCO24342) 
o verbatim thumbdrive (NYCO24343) 
The four San Disk cruzer-thumbdrives (NYCO24344-47) 
The three Seagate IDE hard drives (NYCO24348-50) 
The camera SD card (NYCO24351) 
I think the rest of the devices are either specifically distinguishable and/or have an S/N listed. (By comparison, the USVI 
spreadsheet we have lists an s/n for about 20 of the 25(ish) devices. 
The other thing we're looking for is the location in the house (and ideally specific location) for each device, which the USVI 
list also has — is that info available? 
The list also has just five devices as still pending to be transferred to us, and I think it's right that the plan is to reproduce 
all the materials so that we can get them in searchable format, but just wanted to confirm? Currently, we aren't able to 
match any of the prior productions to specific devices —so if we're able to match them up by Bates number now, that 
might work, but otherwise I think it makes sense for us to get everything. But let us know if any issue with that. 
thanks very much,

Here is The listing of all the evidence gathered in NY that I have. I added some columns to guide you to the 
unique numbers CART NY uses fro their evidence. The template wasn't a slam dunk over, so I did what I could to 
convey the information. If you are confused by anything, please let me know. In the column for approximate 
size, it is in GB, totaled at the bottom and converted to TB. In the materials contained column, I put what load 
file group the data was transferred over in (Mac, Windows, Loose Media, IDE, or Blacklight) If there is no entry 
in that column, that data has yet to be transferred. There are 2 Macs and a DVR you don't have as well as an 
iPhone and an iPad. IF the descriptions are a bit light, let me know and I'll do what I can to beef them up. I will 
get you the Island stuff tomorrow.

Respectfully, I think there are some miscommunications here — all we have asked is to receive the materials in a format 
such that we can view them using a system we have access to. We're not able to get web-enabled access through any FBI 
tool, so we asked for the materials to be transferred in a loadable format so we could put them on Relativity, which both 
we and the agents can access. We're required to have the files in a format that we can produce them to defense counsel. 
I've done that in many other cases and it hasn't previously been an issue. My understanding from 
is that the best 
way to do it now is just for us (the U.S. Attorney's Office) to get the original files, which our vendor will process—by which 
I just mean converting into file formats that are loadable onto Relativity. It doesn't really have anything to do with the 
taint review—we have to have access to the docs in our systems for discovery purposes. 
And we were happy to get the materials as they were processed, but when we received the 1.1 million documents earlier 
this year, they were in a format that wasn't usable for the reasons described in the email I sent on March 9. Again, I 
understand from 
that the best way forward is to just get copies of the materials in their original formats, which I 
understand will be segregated and designated by device. That should work for usl I was just trying to understand the 
approach, as well as the timeline.

Just to be clear. The US Attorney's Office (or it's contractors) are not "processing" anything. You are taking files 
that I will be extracting from processed evidence and putting them into an E-Discovery tool (Relativity) to do a 
taint review. 
Relativity is NOT a forensic tool. It is incapable of dealing with many things that are found forensically on a 
computer like free space, slack space, and system files to name a few. When we started this, and you insisted 
you do the taint review in Relativity, I warned you that it was adding months worth of work on top of what was 
already done, and that Relativity was incapable of viewing everything. You insisted we do it this way. So now 
and I have come up with a way to fit this round peg into this square hole. We will get it done. 
Sorry it has taken so long, but we are talking about terabytes worth of data over multiple forms of digital 
evidence. Phones, tablets, loose media, cameras, DVRs, servers, laptops, and desktop computers. We have 
EFTA00022333
--- PAGE 4 ---
gotten past encryption on multiple devices. When we review devices on such large cases, we usually do it piece 
by piece as things are processed, I was unaware that you didn't want to review as things were processed, that 
you wanted to do it "all at once", so that added to the delay. Sorry for that. Just a differentiation of 
methodology I suppose. 
and I feel confident that the method we have come up with will be more consistent and preserve the 
attribution of files to devices and links of e-mails to attachments that the load file generation that I did a while 
back was lacking.

Okay, so just to check, you both think that there is not a need to do a test run? You're both comfortable with just basically 
sending us copies of everything? I don't totally understand why we couldn't have done that eight months ago, but 
regardless of the passage of time, I want to make sure we understand so we can report to our supervisors. I assume that 
means that we (at the U.S. Attorney's Office and through contractors) will therefore need to do all the processing 
ourselves, correct? And thanks again to you both.

In terms of data transfer, 
are you just sending a literal copy of all the raw data, and we'll process and upload it on 
our end? I ask to make sure we don't lose any searchability — when FBI sent versions before, it had already been 
processed. I think what we talked about on the phone a month ago was getting, for example, data from one device to

Unfortunately I don't think this is very helpful to us. Did you take a look at the example spreadsheet I sent on 2/24? The 
excel file you sent has descriptions that don't match up to the items listed in the search warrant returns (that we sent on 
2/23), and we don't have the 1B or CART numbers to be able to cross-reference. We also can't tell what you mean by 
"loose media" without a specific comparison to what was seized, we don't know which items you're referring to as 
"Windows machines," and we can't tell whether the entirety of any particular item has been transferred, or just partial. 
For example, it looks like we have gotten very, very few image files, which is surprising. 
We have also encountered some very significant problems in trying to review the more than 1 million documents we 
recently received: 
The data we've received has no way to put any emails and attachments together. So if an email says, "see the 
attached flight records," for example, we have no way of linking that up with the records themselves. Not only is 
that a big problem for us in review, it's going to be a huge problem for producing the documents to defense 
counsel. 
The load file has no link to the native file, so when we load the data to the database, there's no way to have the 
native files show up in the database. Because many of the files are too large to open in the viewer, it effectively 
means that there are many files that are completely invisible to us. 
EFTA00022338
--- PAGE 9 ---
Related, the control numbers in the load file don't match up to the native files. So we have two sets of numbers 
and no way to match up anything—that is, even if we were to try to go hunt down every individual large file in the 
native files, it would be impossible. 
So the data that we most recently got, we need to get in a form that addresses those issues, and we likely will need to get 
a similar reproduction of the data we received a couple months ago. Otherwise we're sifting through more than a million 
documents without much rhyme or reason. 
I've re-attached the spreadsheet we sent last week — I think that's a good place to start in terms of our necessary record-
keeping, and we need that info at the very least, as well as anything else you think would be useful. Also attaching the SW 
returns for reference. And again, we're happy to meet up anytime and hash all this out in person if that's useful.

Here is a listing of what I have already handed over in load files to the US Attorney's Office for taint review. Some points of 
clarification: There were 9 IDE hard drives found in the Manhattan apartment, they turned out to be 3 copies of 3 drives 
(9 drives in total) from a July 2007 search on one of his properties. I only processed 3 (as they were all copies). All the 
loose media from the NY apartment is included. All the Windows machines from the NY apartment are included. Only 2 
Macs from NY and 1 from the Island are included. 
I will have to more closely coordinate with whoever is loading up Relativity with the remaining Macs as the tool 
they have to be processed with does not easily re-name the load files. 
Spreadsheet is attached.

mostly hypothetical, obviously, just as examples. That will help us fully understand what's been reviewed, transferred, 
and received so far, and what remains. 
(Also just on the pictures, we do want copies of those as well, please including from the discs and the devices — I think FBI 
was going to do an initial screen to make sure no CP, and since I think the answer was no, we'll need to get those to be 
able to review them as well.) 
many thanks,

Sorry for the delayed response. They are tearing out our old network and giving us a new one, they mandated we 
delete old stuff (about 400 TB worth). Now that they are working on replacing the network, we can do only local 
work. I should be able to give you an accounting of what is what. I can say, off the top of my head, that all 
windows based items from the NY search have been handed over as well as all loose media. The CDs from NY 
only contained pictures, no documents. There are still some Apple items from NY that need to be produced. As 
far as the Island stuff goes, the 1st item on your spreadsheet, the "kitchen" mac has been produced. Still working 
on the rest.

Following up on the below from last weekend, I'm still not sure how we're addressing this so I thought it would make 
sense for us to all schedule a (hopefully relatively brief) meeting to all get on the same page? We didn't hear back on 
which files had previously been provided, but our tech folks did their best to differentiate, and we got access to the 
materials yesterday and its well over a million documents, and we don't have any idea what we're looking at — i.e., which 
devices the materials came from, whether it's full or partial results, how many more devices we have coming, etc. 
Based on the attached search warrant returns, it looks like from the New York mansion (the PDF) there are approximately 
devices that would have storage (computers, hard drives, thumb drives, etc.) and that's not even counting at least 60+ 
CDs. And then from the Virgin Islands (the Excel spreadsheet), at least more than 25 devices, including multiple servers / 
server racks. 
So we gotta know what we've already received, what remains, anticipated schedule, etc, and I know it's a lot of moving 
pieces on all sides so wanted to loop in everybody at once. The case team will be in California this coming week from 
Tuesday through Friday, but then I think generally around the first week of March, which will hopefully be plenty of time 
to schedule a productive meeting. 
thanks all,

I'm not sure who's the exact right person to ask this, so wanted to get everybody on one email chain about it — I have the 
hard drive that 
dropped off that has new Epstein search warrant materials, but it looks like there are also old 
materials (that I think we had previously received and uploaded??) on the hard drive, and so I'm not sure what's new. 
Just generally, and 
and I talked about this last week too, but it's basically impossible for us to keep track of what 
we're getting, and what has been completed, without some kind of identification or labeling system, along with a list of 
which devices have been extracted and downloaded. 
So for example on the hard drive currently, there are 38 folders labeled "IoadFiles" through "37loadFiles" with a modified 
date of 11/14/19, which I think we may have already previously received — but I'm not sure, because we haven't gotten 
any info on which folders match up to which devices, etc. And then there's another folder titled "NYC024362" that has a 
modified date of 1/27/20, so I think that may be the materials we hadn't previously received? That folder by itself has 
more than 600,000 items. 
I don't want to give 
anything that we've already previously received and uploaded, and I can't tell from the folder or 
file names whether everything on the drive is new, or whether just additional materials were saved onto it in addition to 
what we already have. =, 
are you able to give us some guidance on this? Ultimately what we really need is a 
spreadsheet of every device, whether it's been dumped (or partially dumped), and then identifying that same info —
which device, and what materials from it — are being given to us with each data transfer. Otherwise I think 
organizationally and for review purposes it will be a total disaster for us. 
We're happy to have a meeting on this if that's helpful — and thanks everybody for the assistance.

What the Papers Say 
Most headlines are leading with Prince Andrew and his involvement in 
the Epstein inquiry. Telegraph writes "In the latest twist in the saga 
concerning Prince Andrew's links to the billionaire paedophile, the 
Duke's legal team insisted he had offered to speak to the US authorities 
EFTA00022351
--- PAGE 2 ---
"on at least three occasions this year". Revealing the Department of 
Justice (DoJ) had confirmed that the Duke "is not and never has been a 
target of their criminal investigations into Epstein", the statement by 
Blackfords law firm accused US prosecutors of "seeking publicity rather 
than accepting the assistance proffered." The Daily Mail say ' In 
challenging the veracity of America's Department of Justice, which has 
accused him of refusing to cooperate with its investigation into Epstein's 
sex-trafficking network, he is taking on the most powerful law agency in 
the world. And in a further twist last night, U.S. authorities responded 
to the Prince's intervention. In a statement, the Justice Department said 
Andrew had sought to 'falsely portray' himself as a willing participant in 
their inquiry and said he had 'repeatedly declined' to be interviewed. In 
other news, The Times leads with the toppling of the Colston statue by 
antiracism protestors. "The home secretary had a 'firm' conversation 
yesterday with Andy Marsh, the chief constable of Avon and Somerset, 
and demanded an explanation for what had happened in Bristol on 
Sunday. She made clear that she expected those who pulled the statue 
down to face criminal prosecution. There have been no arrests so far". 
The Guardian says "Conservative group leader, Mark Weston, who called 
it "a wanton act". Bristol's mayor, Marvin Rees, the son of a Jamaican 
migrant, said that although the statue had been an "affront" throughout 
his life, he could not "condone criminal damage". "But at the time, 
several of those present told the Guardian, the mood was not 
vandalistic but righteous. After all, more formal attempts to bring about 
the figure's removal had become so bogged down that even an attempt 
to affix a new plaque to better reflect Colston's history had been 
delayed indefinitely". 
The FTwrites, "more than half of Boris Johnson's cabinet are pushing for 
Downing Street to cut the two-metre social distancing rule to contain 
coronavirus, in a move that would provide a huge boost to the 
hospitality industry". City H.M. reports, "Tory MPs have blasted Huawei's 
UK media blitz as a "ridiculous" attempt to gain British sympathy, amid 
increasing pressure for Boris Johnson to cut ties with the Chinese 
technology firm. In an open letter to the British public Huawei today 
emphasised its commitment to the UK over the past two decades and its 
credibility as a telecoms provider. 'For nearly 20 years, we've supplied 
the UK's mobile and broadband companies with 3G and 4G. But some 
now question our role in helping Britain lead the way in 5G,' it said". The 
Independent says, "Matt Hancock said at the Downing Street briefing 
that it was still "our current working plan" that they will not reopen 
until September "at the earliest". "On Tuesday, Boris Johnson will speak 
to his Cabinet before the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, delivers 
a statement to Parliament on the wider reopening of schools". 
According to The Times "Boris Johnson has been urged to offer all Hong 
Kong residents the right to live in the UK to show that Britain is 
EFTA00022352

"serious" about its obligations to the territory. The prime minister, who 
has promised to give three million Hong Kong citizens extended visa-free 
access, was told by senior Tories that he should allow them to remain 
permanently.

He has no specific plans which cannot be moved at this point, but we would only ask that you keep in mind that 
he's going to need to fly up to NY

please let us know if and when you want to meet with him in advance of trial.

We will be joined by two FBI agents who are focusing on the CBP to
 that we have previously discussed. I 
expect one of those agents will take the lead on questioning Mr. 
. The topics we expect to cover include: 
* The identities of,CBP employees Mr. 
recalls interacting with Jeffrey Epstein in the Virgin Islands. 
* Any steps Mr. 
recalls any CBP employees in the Virgin Islands taking to help Epstein and those 
traveling with Epstein to enter the country, including any steps that allowed Epstein or those traveling with him 
to avoid processin,attravelers would normally undergo. 
* Any favors Mr. 
recalls Epstein doing for CBP employees in the Virgin Islands, such as trips to 
Epstein's island. 
Thanks,

Subject: RE: Wednesdays WebEx 
External Email 
Thanks very much, Glen. Let's plan for 1pm on Thursday, 11/12. I will circulate I WebEx invitation shortly. 
We expect to ask Mr. 
about his interactions with 
the U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection employee who worked in Saint Thomas and who had Mr. 
listed as I contact in his phone. I 
expect we will ask for an approximate timeline of when Mr. 
met and interacted with 
the nature 
of those interactions, and any interactions 
may have had with Epstein (to the best of Mr. 
knowledge). 
Best, 
Assistant United States Attorney 
Southern District of New York

Sony for the delay. Looks like we can do between 11 M. and 2 p.m. on Tuesday, 11/10, or any time on 
Thursday, 11/12. Let us know if anything in that range will work. 
So as to make sure Mr. 
is prepared, can you give us an overview of what you expect to cover? 
Thanks, 
Glen

Glen, 
As I believe we mentioned when we last spoke, we would like to schedule time for a second interview with Mr. 
via WebEx. Are there any days the week of November 9th when your team and Mr. 
would be 
available? We would expect this proffer to be much shorter than our first, and certainly no more than two hours 
at most. 
Thanks, 
Assistant United States Attorney

Subject: Wednesday's WebEx 
Thanks for sending the WebEx invitation for Wednesday's meeting to me. For whatever reason, the system is not 
permitting me to forward the invite, so I would ask that you separately invite those copied on this e-mail: Dan, 
Danielle and Mr. 
but also Josh Morrissey who is in our IT group and will make sure we are good to go 
for our meeting. 
Thanks, 
Glen

M, 
We spoke with 
and explained the government's interest in calling him as a witness for Ms. Maxwell's trial. 
He has no specific plans which cannot be moved at this point, but we would only ask that you keep in mind that 
he's going to need to fly up to Na 
Please keep us posted as scheduling proceeds and, obviously, 
please let us know if and when you want to meet with him in advance of trial. 
Best,

Subject: RE: Wednesdays WebEx 
External Email 
We will be joined by two FBI agents who are focusing on the CBP to
 that we have previously discussed. I 
expect one of those agents will take the lead on questioning Mr. 
. The topics we expect to cover include: 
* The identities of,CBP employees Mr. 
recalls interacting with Jeffrey Epstein in the Virgin Islands. 
* Any steps Mr. 
recalls any CBP employees in the Virgin Islands taking to help Epstein and those 
traveling with Epstein to enter the country, including any steps that allowed Epstein or those traveling with him 
to avoid processin,attravelers would normally undergo. 
* Any favors Mr. 
recalls Epstein doing for CBP employees in the Virgin Islands, such as trips to 
Epstein's island. 
Thanks, 
Assistant United States Attorney 
Southern District of New York

Subject: RE: Wednesday's WebEx 
External Email 
Thanks very much, M. Let's plan for 1pm on Thursday, 11/12. I will circulate a WebEx invitation shortly. 
We expect to ask Mr. 
about his interactions with 
the U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection employee who worked in Saint Thomas and who had Mr. 
listed as a contact in his phone. I 
expect we will ask for an approximate timeline of when Mr. 
met and interacted with 
the nature 
of those interactions, and any interactions 
may have had with Epstein (to the best of Mr. 
knowledge). 
Best,

Sony for the delay. Looks like we can do between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. on Tuesday, 11/10, or any time on 
Thursday, 11/12. Let us know if anything in that range will work. 
So as to make sure Mr. 
is prepared, can you give us an overview of what you expect to cover? 
Thanks,

External Email 
As I believe we mentioned when we last spoke, we would like to schedule time for a second interview with Mr. 
via WebEx. Are there any days the week of November 9th when your team and Mr. 
would be 
available? We would expect this proffer to be much shorter than our first, and certainly no more than two hours 
at most. 
Thanks

Subject: Wednesday's WebEx 
Thanks for sending the WebEx invitation for Wednesday's meeting to me. For whatever reason, the system is not 
permitting me to forward the invite so I would ask that you separately invite those copied on this e-mail: Dan, 
and Mr. 
but also 
who is in our IT group and will make sure we are good to go 
for our meeting. 
Thanks,

Thanks for reaching out. We probably are best served by sending you our position on defense disclosures by email. We 
should be able to send that by Friday and can schedule a time to talk thereafter if you wish, with an eye towards the joint 
filing on Monday. 
We will confer with the team on the Speedy Trial issue and also get back to you on that. 
Lastly, do you want to discuss anything regarding Mr. Manley's application to the Court? I believe we are to discuss and 
then you are to write the Court by Friday. I am free tomorrow afternoon to discuss if you wish. 
Thanks,

Counsel, 
(USANYS) 
Per Judge Nathan's Order (docket number 250), is there a time this week when you would be available for a call to meet 
and confer regarding a proposed schedule for defense disclosure of witness statements pursuant to Rule 26.2? Or if you 
EFTA00022486
--- PAGE 2 ---
would prefer to confer by email, would you please let us know your position? 
Additionally, we intend to submit a letter to Judge Nathan requesting that time under the Speedy Trial Act be excluded 
through the date the Court intends to set for trial of Counts One through Six of the 52 Indictment. Although Judge Nathan 
previously excluded time through July 12, 2021, she has not reissued such an order since the return of the 52 Indictment, 
and, of course, the date of trial may change. We therefore intend to seek a clarifying order excluding time, both in light of 
the still-pending suppression motion, which automatically excludes time, and in the interests of justice to allow for trial 
preparation. Would you please let us know whether you consent to the exclusion? 
Thank you,

I've updated the order of proofer to reflect that we need an AT&T custodian (instead of Cingular/T-Mobile).

We're working on drafting a letter in response to the attached, and wanted to give you a heads up. We hope to have a 
draft for you this afternoon, in the hopes of sending the draft to defense counsel tonight as part of the meet-and-confer 
directed by Judge Nathan. I think that leaves sufficient time for filing tomorrow. 
Although we're mindful of third party privacy interests, for non-parties who are neither witnesses nor victims in the case, I 
do have concerns about entertaining redaction/intervention requests, given the high volume of people who may ask to be 
heard or assert a right to review and redact documents if this were entertained.

you. We could write something at the end along the lines that the Government is available to answer questions or try to 
address any concerns they have.

On conferral, I'd suggest we just send them the letter tomorrow and ask them to let us know if there's anything we

Thanks for reaching out. We probably are best served by sending you our position on defense disclosures by email. 
We should be able to send that by Friday and can schedule a time to talk thereafter if you wish, with an eye towards 
the joint filing on Monday. 
We will confer with the team on the Speedy Trial issue and also get back to you on that.

Counsel, 
Per Judge Nathan's Order (docket number 250), is there a time this week when you would be available for a call to 
meet and confer regarding a proposed schedule for defense disclosure of witness statements pursuant to Rule 26.2? 
Or if you would prefer to confer by email, would you please let us know your position? 
Additionally, we intend to submit a letter to Judge Nathan requesting that time under the Speedy Trial Act be 
excluded through the date the Court intends to set for trial of Counts One through Six of the S2 Indictment. 
Although Judge Nathan previously excluded time through July 12, 2021, she has not reissued such an order since the 
return of the S2 Indictment, and, of course, the date of trial may change. We therefore intend to seek a clarifying 
order excluding time, both in light of the still-pending suppression motion, which automatically excludes time, and in 
the interests of justice to allow for trial preparation. Would you please let us know whether you consent to the 
exclusion? 
Thank you, 
Assistant United States Attorney 
Southern District of New York

Hi=, 
A couple of things to put on your radar related to Maxwell's complaints about MDC: 
• With respect to her complaints that MDC confiscated her legal documents in an attorney visit last weekend, MDC 
put in a fairly decent letter citing their regulations that permitted them to search legal documents for contraband 
and that prohibit passing documents to inmates. AM then issued an order denying Maxwell's request for an order 
to show cause, but directing the MDC to affirm whether they copied Maxwell's legal documents and what they are 
doing to protect her A-C privilege. They submitted a response yesterday that confirmed they did not copy the 
documents and outlined their general policies for how attorney visits/calls/video conferences take place. 
• With respect to her complaints about sleep, Maxwell filed the attached letter yesterday, including a photo of an 
alleged black eye that she doesn't know how she got, but it may be related to how she covers her eyes with a sock 
or cloth at night due to the flashlights. (??) AIN directed us to confer with MDC to answer specific questions 
(attached in the memo endorsement to her letter) and submit a response by May 5, which the team is working on. 
Happy to discuss further if you have questions. 
Thanks,

Dear Judge Nathan: 
SOO Thad Avenue 
New Yolk. NY 10022 
♦1 212 957 7600 phono 
www cohongartav corn 
Counsel for the MDC may 
submit any objection to 
the Defendant's request by 
May 4, 2021. 
SO ORDERED. 
We write to respectfully request the Court to issue an order to the MDC directing it to 
accept two hard drives from defense counsel that contain the non-Highly Confidential discovery in 
this case for Ms. Maxwell's use at the MDC. 
In an effort to facilitate Ms. Maxwell's review of the discovery, defense counsel have 
created a master set of two hard drives that contain a complete set of the discovery produced by 
the government so far, excluding the materials marked Highly Confidential, which Ms. Maxwell is 
not permitted to possess in the MDC pursuant to the terms of the Protective Order. The master 
drives are easier to use than her existing hard drives because they collect all of the material in one 
place and organize the documents in a more user-friendly format. For example, the November 18, 
2020 production containing roughly 2.2 million pages was produced in load file format, which 
contains images of individual pages of documents in native file format, image file format, and 
other formats. The hard drives organize these files by document, as opposed to by page, and 
eliminate duplicative file formats so that Ms. Maxwell will not have to add countless hours to her 
review. 
Defense counsel would like to send these hard drives to Ms. Maxwell for her to use in the 
MDC. We were informed by the MDC Legal Department that they are only permitted to accept 
hard drives that are loaded and certified by the U.S. Attorney's Office. We have conferred with 
the government, which has advised that it does not object to the defense making an application to 
the Court to issue an order directing the MDC to accept the hard drives. The government 
requested, however, that the Court allow MDC legal counsel the opportunity to note their 
objections to the Court.

Epstein bail hearing is at 11:30, a couple of reporters have asked if I can tell them how many pages the status

Hi, 
Our Jeffrey Epstein team here is working on gathering material that may be discoverable in our case 
or pertinent to an anticipated motion by Epstein for dismissal based on the S.D.Fla. agreement. We assume you 
had to pull together a lot of discovery for the CVRA litigation, and that you probably have a good sense of where 
else, or with whom else, in the S.D.Fla., we might need to look for pertinent information. The attorneys in the 
N.D.Ga. who are handling the CVRA litigation said we should check directly with you, and  
cleared us to reach out to you directly on this. Would you have some time this week for us to give you a call 
about this? Thanks much,

The team spoke this afternoon with some of Epstein's attorneys. It sounds like one of the defense attorneys (albeit not 
one who joined this call) visited Epstein yesterday, and they were thus familiar with much of the basic information we 
learned last evening. While they were somewhat circumspect, they seemed to acknowledge that it sounded like any 
injury was self-inflicted. They did not suggest that they thought Epstein had been attacked, nor did they ask us to take any 
steps to investigate or protect him. They did ask if it was possible for us to find a way to get him out of the SHU which 
they thought would be better for his mental health, and our team told them they would look into that and also directed 
them to a contact at the MCC. 
Defense counsel also said they plan to visit Epstein next Monday (before their meeting with our team that afternoon), so 
we may learn more at that point.

A week after being denied bail, Jeffrey E. Epstein was found unconscious in his

JANE DOE #1 and JANE DOE #2 
v. 
UNITED STATES 
JANE DOE 1 AND JANE DOE 2'S REPLY TO INTERVENOR EPSTEIN'S BRIEF IN 
OPPOSITION TO PROPOSED REMEDIES 
COME NOW Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2 (also referred to as "the victims"), by and through 
undersigned counsel, having previously provided a submission on proposed remedies (DE 458) 
and in light of Intervenor Epstein's' Brief in Opposition (DE 463) (hereinafter cited as "Epstein 
Remedies Br."), to now reply to Epstein in support of their submission on proposed remedies. For 
the reasons explained in their earlier submissions (see, e.g., DE 458 and 464) and below, the Court 
should reject the Intervenor Epstein's arguments and grant Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2 the various 
remedies their seek to enforce and protect their rights under the Crime Victims' Rights Act 
(CVRA) — including rescission of the non-prosecution agreement. 
INTRODUCTION 
As Jane Doe 1 and 2 explained in their earlier submissions, this case involves deception of 
dozens of Florida victims of an international sex trafficking organization — the organization led by 
As discussed below, Epstein was granted "limited" intervention in this case to address 
remedies. Since remedies are now at issue, Epstein has full intervention rights and will be 
referenced throughout this reply as "Intervenor Epstein."

Intervenor Epstein. The Government2 and Epstein reached a secret non-prosecution agreement 
(NPA) and then concealed that agreement until it was firmly in place — and the victims lost any 
opportunity to object. This secret justice for Epstein and his co-conspirators has led to a national 
outcry about unfairness and unequal treatment of the wealthy and powerful in the criminal justice 
system. 
This Court has previously determined that Jane Doe 1 and 2's CVRA rights to confer with 
prosecutors were violated through the machinations of prosecutors and Epstein. This Court then 
called for briefing on the appropriate remedy for that violation. DE 454. Jane Doe I and 2 have 
proposed rescission of the NPA's "immunity" provisions, which have prevented victims from 
conferring with prosecutors in the USAO-SDFL about prosecuting Epstein for the crimes he 
committed in Florida against them. Epstein claims that this remedy is not available to this Court. 
But the Court has previously held that it is a permissible remedy and nothing that Epstein raises 
should cause the Court to reverse course. The NPA's immunity provisions were founded in 
illegality — specifically, their concealment from the victims - something that Epstein well knew 
and, indeed, specifically sought. Accordingly, this Court can and should rescind the immunity 
provisions as the appropriate remedy for the victims. Rescission will vindicate Jane Doe 1 and 2's 
CVRA rights, by permitting them to confer with prosecutors in this district about obtaining federal 
prosecution here — against Epstein and all of his coconspirators. 
Epstein has little to say about the other remedies that the Jane Does seek, and accordingly 
the Court should (for reasons articulated earlier) grant those remedies as well. 
References to the "Government" in this case should be generally understood to refer to 
the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida (USAO-SDFL), which is currently 
being represented by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia.

Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 6 of 70 
THIS CASE MUST BE DECIDED ON THE AGREED PREMISE THAT THE NPA 
ONLY COVERS THE U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT 
OF FLORIDA. 
For many years, this case has been litigated on the premise that the NPA negotiated by 
Epstein with prosecutors in the Southern District of Florida only precludes his prosecution in the 
Southern District of Florida. Indeed, the NPA's plain terms directly limit the agreement to "this 
District." See NPA at 2 (noting that the agreement was signed "on the authority of R. Alexander 
Acosta, United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida" and requires that "prosecution 
in this District for [various federal offenses] shall be deferred" and that no federal prosecution of 
Epstein "will be instituted in this District"). This is consistent with the statute creating the Office 
of U.S. Attorney, which allows each U.S. Attorney to prosecute offenses only "within his district." 
U.S.C. § 547. 
In light of this plain language, the NPA has no application to prosecutors in other judicial 
districts, such as the Southern District of New York. See United States v. Fernandez, No. 17-CR-
167 (JMF), 2017 WL 6372783 at *2 (S.D.N.Y. 2017) ("The Second Circuit has squarely held that 
"[w]hen the express terms of a plea agreement set forth promises by `the Government,' . . . the 
plea agreement binds only the office of the United States Attorney for the district in which the plea 
is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction, or 
unless there is evidence to show that a prosecutor is attempting to evade its own obligations under 
the plea agreement by transferring a prosecution to another office" (citing United States v. 
Salameh, 152 F.3d 88, 120 (2d Cir. 1998)). 
The fact that the USAO-SDFL's agreement with Epstein applies only to the Southern 
District of Florida has been made explicitly throughout this litigation — without any objection from 
EFTA00022551
--- PAGE 7 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 7 of 70 
Intervenor Epstein. See, e.g., DE 205-6 at 30 (". . the USAO-SDFL did not bargain away the 
possibility of federal criminal charges being instituted in other districts based on alleged sexual 
acts that Epstein committed against [Jane Doe I and 2]. Such charges can still potentially be 
pursued in other districts, such as the Southern District of New York . . .."); DE 205-2 at 8-9 ("a 
number of districts outside the Southern District of Florida (e.g., the Southern District of New 
York ...) share jurisdiction and venue with the Southern District of Florida over potential federal 
criminal charges based on the alleged sexual acts committed by Epstein against [Jane Doe 1 and 
2]. Epstein is thus subject to potential prosecution for such acts in those districts."); see also DE 
464 at 13 n.4 ("The NPA negotiated by attorneys in the Southern District of Florida obviously only 
precluded prosecution in the Southern District of Florida"). Several of the remedies the victims 
have proposed are clearly predicated on this long-standing assumption. For example, the victims 
have sought documents about the investigation regarding Epstein conducted by FBI-Miami 
(remedy #10), education in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida (remedy 
#14), and sealed remedies involving other U.S. Attorney's Offices (remedy #18). The victims 
would have crafted all of these proposed remedies (and others) differently if they had any 
suggestion from Epstein that this case involved immunity that extended nationwide. 
Moreover, other important aspects of this case have involved the predicate that this case 
concerned Epstein's federal crimes subject to prosecution in this District. 
For example, 
Government notifications to crime victims about this case have apparently only gone to Epstein 
victims in this District. 
Intervenor Epstein's factual "background" section of his brief only makes clearer that the 
NPA at issue in this case does not have any nationwide reach. As Epstein's "background" section 
EFTA00022552
--- PAGE 8 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 8 of 70 
argues, the negotiations between the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida 
(USAO-SDFL) and Epstein's high-powered legal team focused on the defense claim that this case 
"was, at heart, a local sex abuse case." Epstein Remedies Br. at 15 (quoting former First Assistant 
U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Sloman). 
Indeed, one of the experts that Intervenor Epstein hired 
represented to the Justice Department during discussions about the NPA that "[t]his is a case about 
purely local activity, involving local actors, and affecting local interests and thus, should be 
handled by local authorities." Id. at 15. In other words, according to Epstein's defense attorneys 
at the time that the NPA was under consideration, this was not a case "present[ing] 
multijurisdictional obstacles" beyond the ability of "States and localities" to confront. Id. at 16. 
This Court has previously ruled that this case is to be decided based on a possible CVRA 
rights violation "of Jane Doe 1, Jane Doe 2, and all `other similarly situated victims' (DE 324 at 
9), where all the victims under contemplation have been victimized by Epstein through federal 
crimes subject to prosecution here. Ultimately, as Epstein himself puts it, this case involves "the 
exercise of discretion by ... federal prosecutors in the Southern District of Florida." Id. at 18. 
It is common knowledge that Intervenor Epstein is currently being prosecuted by federal 
prosecutors in the Southern District of New York. The NPA in this case has no connection to or 
bearing on that prosecution there — and the Court should craft remedies for the victims in this 
District for the violations of rights that occurred here.

DISCUSSION 
I. 
INTERVENOR EPSTEIN HAS RECEIVED PROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS 
THROUGH AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD AND SUBMIT EVIDENCE ON 
ISSUES PERTAINING TO REMEDIES. 
A. 
As an Intervenor, Epstein Has Received Procedural Due Process. 
Intervenor Epstein begins his arguments with a procedural claim that he has somehow been 
denied "procedural due process" in this matter. Epstein Remedies Br. at 14-19. His argument is 
difficult to understand. More than six years ago, Epstein filed a motion for "limited intervention" 
in this case, seeking to "intervene in these proceedings when and if they reach the stage at which 
the Court will consider what remedy to order if it finds that the government violated the [victims'] 
rights under the CVRA." DE 207 at 1. As Epstein explained in his motion, this Court had earlier 
ruled that "rescission relief' was an available remedy in this case. Id. Accordingly, Epstein had 
"clear and compelling interest[s] in opposing any remedy that would entail rescission of his non-
prosecution agreement with the government," and these interests were "personal to him and would 
not be adequately represented by the government should the Court determine that a CVRA 
violation occurred and that rescission or re-opening of the non-prosecution agreement was one of 
the remedial options under consideration." Id. The victims did not oppose his intervention. DE 
209 at 3-4. And the Court duly granted Epstein's intervention motion. DE 246 at 1 (order allowing 
Epstein "to intervene with regard to any remedy issue concerning the non-prosecution 
agreement"). 
Of course, this Court subsequently found a violation of the victims' CVRA rights, squarely 
posing remedial issues. And the Court thereafter asked for submissions on how to proceed to 
determine appropriate remedies, receiving briefing on scheduling from the two victims and the 
EFTA00022554
--- PAGE 10 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 10 of 70 
USAO-SDFL — and from Epstein. In his scheduling brief, Epstein explained that "[r]egarding the 
mechanism for determining remedy, neither party disputes that Mr. Epstein has a right to be heard 
. . . . Mr. Epstein respectfully submits that he should be given an opportunity to file a response to 
the substantive legal briefs of the parties on the issue of remedy within 30 days after [the victims'] 
brief is filed, before the Court permits the taking of any evidence in this matter." DE 453 at 2. 
Thereafter, the Court established a briefing schedule that essentially tracked what Epstein 
proposed, and specifically allowed Epstein to "file affidavits or declarations in support of his 
position." See DE 454 at 2. 
In the wake of all this, Intervenor Epstein now broadly asserts that "summary judgment 
was granted against the government, not Mr. Epstein" and that, therefore, "there can be no remedy 
that prejudices him." DE 463 at 25. But the legal support for this claim is a mystery. It was 
Epstein himself who proposed limited intervention as the appropriate procedural device to allow 
him to be heard in this case. And obviously Epstein has had full notice and opportunity to be heard 
on remedy issues, including an opportunity to submit any relevant evidence he wants and to 
challenge any finding that he believes are inaccurate. As Epstein's own authority makes clear, the 
key requirement for due process is whether a litigant has "received a `full and fair' opportunity to 
litigate [his] claims." Parklane Hosiery Co., Inc. v. Shore, 439 U.S. 322, 332 (1979). Epstein 
raises no suggestions that he has been denied that opportunity here. 
Epstein does point to the fact that the Eleventh Circuit has previously ruled in this case that 
he is not "an ordinary litigant." Jane Doe 1 v. United States, 749 F.3d 999, 1005 (11th Cir. 2014). 
But that ruling, which involved the disclosure of certain correspondence, is of no relevance now. 
The Eleventh Circuit was simply describing this Court's earlier ruling on intervention. Indeed, the 
EFTA00022555
--- PAGE 11 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 11 of 70 
Eleventh Circuit made clear it was fully approving this Court's approach of allowing Epstein to 
raise remedial issues at the end of the case: 
The victims argue that Epstein has made himself an ordinary litigant through his 
intervention, but we disagree. . 
[T]he district court has granted Epstein limited 
intervention to challenge only the disclosure of his attorneys' correspondence and 
any remedy that involves the non-prosecution agreement. Epstein's only 
opportunity to challenge the disclosure order is now because there will not be an 
adverse judgment against him or his attorneys. The district court instead will enter 
any judgment against either the victims or the United States. And, even if the victims 
succeed in their petition to rescind the non-prosecution agreement, Epstein can 
challenge only that remedy, not thejudgment against the United States. The victims 
intend to use the correspondence from Epstein's attorneys to prove that the United 
States violated the Act, which is an issue separate from the kind of relief necessary 
to remedy that violation. And it is all the more likely that the district court would 
fashion a remedy that does not involve the non-prosecution agreement, if the district 
court were to conclude that rescission is unavailable, which might then bar an 
appeal by Epstein of that remedy. 
749 F.3d at 1005-06 (emphasis added). Plainly when it ruled in 2014, the Eleventh Circuit foresaw 
a situation where Epstein might need to challenge a rescission remedy during a remedial phase of 
this case — which is precisely what has happened. 
The very purpose of allowing a person to intervene in a case is to ensure "that a single set 
of factual findings will bind" the intervenor and the other parties. Huff v. Commissioner of IRS, 
743 F.3d 790, 797 (11th Cir. 2014). And the "fundamental requirement of due process is the 
opportunity to be heard `at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.'" Reams v. hvin, 561 
F.3d 1258, 1263 (11th Cir. 2009) (quoting Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 333 (1976)). Here 
Epstein argues that he has been "deprived . . of the ability to contest numerous allegations and 
stipulations at the liability phase." Epstein Remedies Br. at 28. This is simply untrue. Epstein 
was free to challenge all allegations (and alleged "stipulations") from the liability phase, to the 
EFTA00022556
--- PAGE 12 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 12 of 70 
extent that they had any bearing on remedy. Indeed, this Court made clear that Intervenor Epstein 
could "file affidavits or declarations in support of his position." See DE 454 at 2. 
Epstein complains, for example, about the fundamental premise of this case: that Jane Doe 
is a "crime victim" covered by the Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA). Epstein argues that this 
is not possible, because there are no pending federal charges against Epstein in this District. But 
this Court has already cited evidence and explained the reasons for concluding that Jane Doe 1 
was a victim of a federal crime committed by Epstein in the Southern District of Florida. 359 
F.Supp.3d at 1204. If Epstein wanted to challenge that finding, all he had to do was file an 
affidavit, under oath, to that effect. He chose not to do so — and due process hardly precludes 
continuing to move forward in this case on the basis of an unchallenged and factually supported 
finding made long ago. 
Moreover, if taken seriously, Epstein's position would sap the CVRA of much of its value. 
This Court has already held that exercising CVRA rights is possible before criminal charges are 
formally filed, noting that 18 U.S.C. § 3771(d)(3) provides that "the CVRA's enumerated rights 
`shall be asserted in the district court in which a defendant is being prosecuted for the crime or, if 
no prosecution is underway, in the district court in the district in which the crime occurred.'" Does 
v. United States, 817 F.Supp.2d 1337, 1342 (S.D. Fla. 2011) (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 377(d)(3) 
(emphasis added)). This Court explained that the CVRA's language allows CVRA's rights to "be 
enforced before a prosecution is underway . . ", id. (emphasis added) — i.e., to be "enforced" in 
this Court. Of course, the Crime Victims Rights Act creates rights for "crime victims," which in 
Epstein's (erroneous) view can never exist until a formal indictment is filed. Epstein's argument 
would essentially eviscerate the CVRA's pre-charging protections and should be rejected.

B. 
The Court's Findings About Epstein Counsel's Awareness of Concealment of 
the Non-Prosecution Agreement are Well-Supported and Unchallenged. 
1. 
Through Counsel, Epstein Was a Party to the Illegal Concealment of 
the Non-Prosecution Agreement. 
Intervenor Epstein also argues that his defense counsel "acted in good faith." Epstein 
Remedies Br. at 30. But he never defines what he means by "good faith." Rather than debating 
how to characterize the actions of the defense team, the salient factual issue is this Court's specific 
findings that the Government decided "to conceal the existence of the NPA and mislead the victims 
to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility." 359 F.Supp.3d at 1219. And the Court 
has also previously found that "Epstein's counsel was aware that the Office was deliberately 
keeping the NPA secret from the victims and, indeed, had sought assurances to that effect." Id. at 
1208 (citing DE 407 at ¶ 48 (emphasis added)). 
While Intervenor Epstein quibbles over the accuracy of these findings, one preliminary 
point is important: Epstein does not offer any factual evidence to the contrary. For instance, even 
though this Court invited Epstein to provide any affidavits or declarations in support of his position 
(DE 454 at 2), Epstein offered nothing. Nor did Epstein challenge the admissibility of evidence 
that Jane Doe 1 and 2 have previously provided. As a result, in attacking this finding, Epstein can 
only rely on the existing evidence. 
Epstein's main point appears to be not that this Court was wrong in finding that the NPA 
was concealed from the victims through misleading statements, but rather that this Court was 
technically incorrect about when the concealment began. Thus, Epstein argues (in bold face type) 
that "nowhere in the record is there any evidence that Mr. Epstein's counsel, prior to September 
EFTA00022558

Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 14 of 70 
24, 2007, urged the government not to consult with [the victims] about the government's 
intentions." Epstein Remedies Br. at 31 (emphasis reorganized). 
The Court will immediately notice the hedged and negative proposition that Epstein 
defends — i.e., Epstein does not argue that the Court's conclusion about concealment is somehow 
incorrect but merely that no record evidence exists to prove the point. But record evidence 
obviously demonstrates that Epstein and his lawyers signed the NPA, which itself provided that 
"[t]he parties anticipate that this agreement will not be made part of any public record. If the 
United States received a Freedom of Information Act request or any compulsory process 
commanding the disclosure of the agreement, it will provide notice to Epstein before making that 
disclosure." NPA at I 13 (emphasis added). This Court noted this provision as part of its factual 
findings. 359 F.Supp.3d at 1208. The NPA's plain language thus makes clear both that Epstein 
knew the NPA was being concealed and, by requiring that notice go to him before disclosure, that 
it was at Epstein's insistence that this provision is included. After all, the Government would have 
no reason to bind itself to an undertaking to provide special notice to Epstein. 
Perhaps recognizing that is difficult to contest that he sought the concealment provision, 
Epstein quickly falls back to the position that his lawyers "never conditioned his agreement to the 
NPA on non-disclosure to victims of the intended resolution." Epstein Remedies Br. at 31. To be 
sure, it may be impossible to say exactly how the negotiations proceeded and what was a vital 
"condition" for either side. Many of the important details were hammered out in unrecorded, face-
to-face meetings between prosecutors and defense attorneys. And for reasons that Epstein never 
explains, his attorneys were discussing with prosecutors how to meet "off campus" to finalize the 
agreement. See DE 361 at 14 (line prosecutor writes to defense counsel that "Maybe we can set 
EFTA00022559
--- PAGE 15 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 15 of 70 
a time to meet. If you want to meet `off campus' somewhere, that is fine"). Indeed, the 
documentary evidence in this case makes clear that at least one additional meeting was held off 
campus between the Government and Epstein. Id. 
But while the Court may never know precisely what Epstein "conditioned" his agreement 
on, it is quite reasonable to conclude that Epstein was "seeking assurances" that the agreement 
would not be disclosed — or, at the very least, not disclosed without an opportunity for him to 
object. Indeed, the record makes clear that it was Epstein's lawyers who first asked about whether 
the NPA would be made public. DE 361 at 15. And, as the NPA was being executed, defense 
counsel followed up again with the line prosecutor, specifically requesting that she "do whatever 
you can to keep [the NPA] from becoming public." 359 F.Supp.3d at 1207. 
Moreover, even before the NPA was signed, uncontested documentary evidence shows that 
Epstein was working to conceal what happened from the victims. For example, as the Court noted 
in its findings, the line prosecutor and Epstein's counsel were working together to "avoid the 
press." 359 F.Supp.3d at 1206. These documents pertain to events before the NPA was executed 
on September 24, 2007, proving that Epstein's defense attorneys sought to have the NPA 
concealed in advance of its signing. Given that concealment of the NPA necessarily meant that 
the victims were being denied their right to confer, Epstein clearly became a party to the CVRA 
violation even before the NPA was executed. 
But it is hardly necessary to the Court's CVRA findings that Epstein have been involved 
in concealing the NPA before it was signed. The NPA was not actually consummated until months 
later, in June 2008. And by being party to — and surely instigator of— that extended concealment, 
Epstein was responsible for the CVRA violations.

Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 16 of 70 
If there is any doubt on this point, it only reinforces the victims' motion that it should 
receive all records associated with the negotiations, including information about the Government's 
deliberations. Given that both the Government and now Epstein are making representations about 
what occurred during the negotiations, there is every reason for finding a waiver of work product 
and other protections, and a compelling need for disclosing all documents about what happened. 
See generally Jane Doe 1 and 2's Motion for Finding of Waiver of Work Product and Similar 
Protections and for Production of Documents, DE 414 (currently pending before the Court per DE 
464 at 14).3
Epstein also points to internal Justice Department regulations, arguing that they show that 
the CVRA was technically inapplicable in this case. Epstein Remedies Br. at 21. But to the extent 
that those guidelines failed to extend victims' rights during the pre-charging process, those 
guidelines were simply illegal — as this Court ruled long ago. Does v. United States, 817 F.Supp.2d 
1337, 1341 (S.D. Fla. 2011). 
Epstein also fails to fully describe what the Justice Department regulations required the 
Justice Department to do during the investigative stage of a case. The 2005 Attorney General 
Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance (hereinafter "2005 A.G. Victim Guidelines") to 
which he refers required the FBI to "provide the victim with the earliest possible notice concerning 
the status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent that it is appropriate and will not interfere 
In an effort to comply with the Court's scheduling order — and to provide consolidated 
briefing — Jane Doe 1 and 2 have not filed a separately docketed motion for production of the 
materials, instead explaining in their briefs the grounds for production. If the Court believes that 
a separate motion is necessary to raise this issue, Jane Doe 1 and 2 would respectfully request 
leave be permitted to rapidly file such a motion. 
A full copy of the 2005 Guidelines is available in Justice Department archives at 
https://www.justice.govisites/default/files/olp/docs/ag_guidelines2012.pdf.

Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 17 of 70 
with the investigation." 2005 A.G. Victim Guidelines at p. 25, Part IV.A.3.a.3 (citing 42 U.S.C. 
§ 10607(c)(3)A)5) (emphasis added)). Presumably, this requirement that the FBI keep victims 
informed is why Epstein and the prosecutors were discussing meeting privately "off campus," as 
a normal "on campus" meeting would have involved FBI agents and others Justice Department 
employees (e.g., victim-witness coordinators) who would have been obligated by these regulations 
to provide Epstein's victims with more information about what was happening. 
Epstein also refers to a 2010 opinion of the Justice Department's Office of Legal (OLC), 
which concluded that the CVRA did not extend rights until the filing of formal charges. Epstein 
Remedies Br. at 32. Of course, the OLC opinion did not exist in 2007-08, when USAO-SDFL and 
Epstein were concealing the NPA. Moreover, it is unsurprising to find that the Justice Department 
would be staking out a very narrow (but unsupportable) position on its legal obligations under the 
law. Cf. Paul G. Cassell, Nathanael J. Mitchell & Bradley J. Edwards, Applying the Crime Victims' 
Rights Act Before Criminal Charges are Filed, 104 J. CRIM. L. & CRIMINOLOGY 59, 76-77 (2014) 
("OLC's analysis is unpersuasive."). 
But this debate over legal application of the CVRA in pre-charging situations is ultimately 
wide of the mark as an attack on the Court's findings regarding the CVRA violation here. The 
USAO-SDFL had made its own determination that the CVRA did, indeed, apply in this case — and 
was telling victims that they had CVRA rights well before the NPA was ever signed. As this Court 
has previously found, as early as March 2007, the USAO-SDFL sent official notices to Epstein 
victims informing them that they had rights under the CVRA. For example, on about June 7, 2007, 
This statute has since been superseded by other victim enactments and has accordingly 
been repealed. 
EFTA00022562
--- PAGE 18 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 18 of 70 
FBI agents delivered a standard CVRA notification letter to Jane Doe 1. 359 F.Supp.2d at 1205. 
In this letter, the USAO-SDFL promised that it would "make its `best efforts' to protect Jane Doe 
l's [CVRA] rights, including `the reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the United States 
in the case 
..'" Id. Jane Doe 1 "relied on those representations and believed that the government 
would protect those rights and keep her informed about the progress of the case." Id. Nowhere in 
his response does Epstein claim that his counsel were unaware of this approach. 
This issue about the Justice Department's guidelines has already been evaluated by this 
Court. As this Court explained in granting summary judgment: 
Nor did the Justice Department guidelines create an exemption from the CRVA's 
statutory requirements. Although the Government points to guidelines that 
conflicted with the requirements of the CVRA (by restricting CVRA rights until 
after a formal indictment), the Court is not persuaded that the guidelines were the 
basis for the Government's decision to withhold information about the NPA from 
the victims. If that had been the case, the Government would not have sent the 
victim letters telling them that they had rights protected under the CVRA. Nor 
would they have told Epstein's attorneys that it had obligations to notify the 
victims. In any event, an agency's own "'interpretation' of a statute cannot 
supersede the language chosen by Congress." Mohasco Corp. v. Silver, 447 U.S. 
807, 825 (1980). 
Given that the USAO-SDFL had told the victims that the CVRA applied, it was obligated 
to confer with them and treat them fairly. Epstein does not argue (much less provide evidence) 
that his extensive legal team was unaware that the USAO-SDFL was following CVRA 
requirements. Thus, the record fully supports the conclusion that, through his many lawyers, 
Epstein was aware that the CVRA was in play and that, as a result of his pressure, the Government 
was not conferring with his victims. 
Even more important, Epstein cannot point to anything in Justice Department policy 
requiring that a non-prosecution agreement be concealed from victims, much less permitting 
EFTA00022563
--- PAGE 19 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 19 of 70 
prosecutors to mislead victims. While Epstein claims that he was simply asking USAO-SDFL to 
"follow its own national guidelines," Epstein Remedies Br. at 22, he was in fact asking for a clear 
departure from standard procedures. Indeed, the USAO-SDFL has admitted that "Epstein's 
counsel convinced the [Office] that (contrary to standard Government practice) Epstein should be 
permitted to provide input into any message being delivered, and ultimately that the victims should 
not be told anything `until after Epstein pleas.'" DE 361 at 5-6 (citing Exhibit 25) (emphasis 
added). 
And, as this Court has previously explained, "Particularly problematic was the 
Government's decision to conceal the existence of the NPA and mislead the victims to believe that 
federal prosecution was still a possibility. When the Government gives information to victims, it 
cannot be misleading." 359 F.Supp.3d at 1219. 
After the NPA was signed, Epstein concedes that he was involved in the notifications to 
victims. Thus, Epstein points to a letter sent by his counsel, on December 6, 2007, indicating that 
he did not object some form of notice being given to the alleged victims." Epstein Remedies Br. 
at 32 (citing DE 403-15:3). But as even a quick glance that letter makes clear, the "form of notice" 
that Epstein had in mind was very limited — indeed, Epstein's counsel was proposing that it merely 
be sent by the State Attorney and presumably would not mention the federal non-prosecution 
provisions. DE 403-15:3-4. Moreover, that same letter makes clear that Epstein was strenuously 
seeking an opportunity to review victim notices from the government. Id. at 3. Accordingly, when 
just a few weeks later the Government began circulating "misleading" notices, the record plainly 
supports the conclusion that Epstein had seen and approved the notices — and Epstein advances no 
argument (or evidence) to the contrary. 
EFTA00022564
--- PAGE 20 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 20 of 70 
Remarkably, despite all this evidence that Epstein was pressuring the USAO-SDFL not to 
discharge its statutory obligation to confer with the victims, Epstein attempts to claim that "federal 
law enforcement's decision to not [confer] with [the victims] was made, not for Mr. Epstein's 
benefit, but rather to protect their own prosecutorial interests." Epstein Remedies Br. at 23. The 
basis for this claim is selected excerpts from an affidavit of the line prosecutor. Id. (citing DE 403-
18). The fact that Epstein, joined by the USAO-SDFL, are both now using this affidavit discussing 
internal deliberations of the Office only confirms that work product and other protections have 
been waived over documents regarding those deliberations. See generally Jane Doe 1 and 2's 
Motion for Finding of Waiver of Work Product and Similar Protections and for Production of 
Documents, DE 414.6 Once again, the victims reassert their motion that they are entitled to see 
those documents, to be in position to challenge the USAO-SDFL's arguments about benign 
intentions — and now Epstein's similar claims. See DE 464 at 14 (reasserting DE 414). 
Moreover, Epstein fails to fully discuss what the line prosecutor's affidavit essentially 
admits. The affidavit only attempts to provide an explanation for failing to disclose the NPA's 
financial compensation provisions. See, e.g., DE 403-19 at 10-11 ¶ 21 (claiming that disclosure 
would have subjected victims to cross-examination). But the affidavit never explains why the 
most significant feature of the non-prosecution agreement was being concealed from the victims 
— i.e., the fact that the agreement would lead to Epstein's non-prosecution. As a result, through its 
Waiver by the Government is also further demonstrated by the press conference held by 
then-Labor Secretary R. Alexander Acosta on July 10, 2019. Before the Washington press corps 
and a global television audience, Acosta discussed the substance of the affidavit and deliberations 
by the USAO-SDFL on the case. See https://www.c-span.orgivideon462479-1/1abor-secretary-
defends-handling-epstein-plea-deal-amid-calls-resignation/. Indeed, the affidavit was part of the 
"press packet" Acosta handed out. 
EFTA00022565
--- PAGE 21 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 21 of 70 
silence, the affidavit concedes what is glaringly obvious: That due to Epstein's pressure, the 
USAO-SDFL was hiding from the victims that Epstein had already secured a signed agreement 
providing immunity from federal prosecution in Florida to him (and all "potential co-conspirators" 
for good measure). 
This Court has already discussed the point, noting that, in January 2008, when the USAO-
SDFL sent notices to the victims counseling "patience," the Office "had bound itself to the terms 
of the NPA unless Epstein failed to comply with the terms. It was a material omission for the 
Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to investigation about which 
it had already bound itself not to prosecute." 359 F.Supp.3d at 1221. Obviously, the notices to 
the victims could have been written differently to avoid a "material omission." But it was clearly 
due to Epstein's efforts that the immunity provisions were being concealed to avoid a firestorm of 
controversy that would have occurred if that fact was disclosed publicly. 
2. 
Evidence Exists that the Epstein Defense Team Acted in Bad Faith. 
Epstein further asserts that the existing "record conclusively refutes any bad faith" on the 
part of his counsel. Epstein Remedies Br. at 20. But the victims have also previously made well-
supported allegations of bad faith actions. In their summary judgment motion, for example, Jane 
Doe 1 and 2 alleged that on February I, 2007, the Epstein defense team sent a 24-page letter to the 
Office, which "falsely stated: `Epstein did not know or believe any women were under 18 years of 
age.' It also contained other deceptive factual and legal arguments about Epstein's culpability." 
DE 361 at 10 (citing Exhibit 43) (emphasis added). Jane Doe 1 and 2 further alleged that, on July 
6, 2007, Epstein's lawyers sent a 23-page letter to USAO-SDFL which "falsely claimed that `Mr. 
Epstein never targeted minors' . . . ." DE 361 at 11 (citing Exhibit 47) (emphasis added). Jane

--- PAGE 22 ---
' Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 22 of 70 
Doe I and 2 also alleged that Epstein's lawyers were discussing with the prosecutors a disposition 
that would make it difficult for a judge to know what was really happening. DE 361 at 14 (citing 
Exhibit 7). And Jane Doe 1 and 2 also alleged that Epstein and government lawyers were using 
private, home e-mail address to conduct some of their discussions — and noted that no emails sent 
to or from any home c-email addresses of prosecutors has every been produced. DE 361 at 15. 
Jane Doe 1 and 2 reassert all of these thus-far uncontested factual claims and ask that the 
Court accept them as part of deciding the basis for crafting an appropriate remedy. Epstein has 
not challenged any of these facts proffered by Jane Doe 1 and 2. If Epstein wants this case to be 
decided based on how his legal team acted, he needs to provide affidavits or other evidence of its 
conduct — and he has not done so. 
Even more significantly with regard to the alleged "bad faith" of Epstein's defense team is

3. 
The USAO-SDFL Was Not Authorized to Extend Epstein Immunity 
Without First Conferring with his Victims. 
Epstein also argues that the NPA is "a legal agreement." Epstein Remedies Br. at 25. By 
this he apparently means that, if one looks merely at the four corners of the document, no provision 
is, on its face, illegal. But as Jane Doe 1 and 2 have explained earlier, it is well accepted that a 
contract or other agreement can be illegal based on the way in which it was formed. See Victims' 
Remedy Reply to the Gov't. DE 464 at 27. Indeed, the Eleventh Circuit has clearly held that the 
manner in which an agreement is formed can render an otherwise-valid agreement unenforceable. 
In San Pedro v. United States, 79 F.3d 1065 (11th Cir. 1996), the Eleventh Circuit held that in 
order for any provision in a plea agreement to be enforceable, "there must have been a valid, 
binding agreement in the first instance . . . 
Id. at 1068. In San Pedro, a defendant sought to 
block a deportation proceeding by immigration authorities, arguing that a promise by prosecutors 
of transactional immunity included a promise of nondeportation. Id. at 1067-68. In that case, as 
in this one, it could have been argued that a promise of nondeportation was "a legal agreement." 
But, nonetheless, the promise was unenforceable because, the Eleventh Circuit explained, the 
prosecutor who made the commitment was not authorized to do so. Id. at 1070. In particular, "the 
EFTA00022571
--- PAGE 27 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 27 of 70 
United States Attorney and the AUSAs who negotiated the plea agreement with San Pedro did not 
have the authority to promise that he would not be deported." Id. at 1072. 
So too here. Prosecutors were simply not authorized to offer Epstein immunity until they 
had conferred with Epstein's victims. Accordingly, the NPA's immunity provisions were not part 
of a "valid, binding agreement in the first instance." 79 F.3d at 1068. And thus, Epstein is not 
entitled to take advantage of the non-prosecution provisions, at least with respect to crimes against 
Jane Doe 1 and 2 and any other victim who desires to have him prosecuted. 
In their remedy briefing, Jane Doe 1 and 2 have asked for "partial" rescission of the 
immunity provisions — that is, rescission of the immunity provisions for only those victims who 
seek rescission. DE 464 at 17-30. In response, Epstein could have theoretically made an argument 
for the NPA's "total rescission." Indeed, the victims have previously discussed this issue in 
responding to the briefing of the USAO-SDFL, explaining that the Office itself lacked "standing" 
to advance a request for total rescission. Id. at 30. The victims then explained that Epstein would 
have standing to advance such a "total" rescission argument — if he wanted to. Id. And after this 
briefing — explicitly noting that Epstein would need to advance such an argument for total 
rescission — Epstein has not done so. 
Presumably the reason that Epstein is not asking for total rescission of his NPA with the 
USAO-SDFL is that it would eliminate what is reportedly his main defense to recent sex trafficking 
charges in the Southern District of New York — that somehow an agreement with the U.S. Attorney 
for the Southern District of Florida blocking prosecution in "this District" prevents federal 
prosecutors in New York from prosecuting crimes committed there. But the Court need not reach 
any conclusion about Epstein's motives for declining to ask for total rescission. In light of this 
EFTA00022572
--- PAGE 28 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 28 of 70 
sequence of events, Epstein has clearly waived any right to seek total rescission of the NPA. And 
— as the victims predicted (DE 464 at 30-31) — the case as presented to this Court now boils down 
to either upholding an illegal agreement or partially rescinding it. 
Given the choice between the only two options presented to it (at least that this time12), this 
Court's duty is clear. Congress has instructed that "[i]n any court proceeding involving an offense 
against a crime victim, the court shall ensure that the crime victim is afforded the rights described 
in [the CVRA]." 18 U.S.C. § 3771(b)(1) (emphasis added). This Court also previously held that 
"[w]hile Epstein was within his rights to attempt to persuade higher authorities with the 
Department of Justice to overrule the prosecutorial decisions of the U.S. Attorney's Office in the 
Southern District of Florida, the CVRA was designed to give victims the same opportunity to 
attempt to affect prosecutorial decisions before they became final." 359 F.Supp.3d at 1221 
(emphasis added). While the victims have asked for partial rescission to give them the "same 
opportunity" that Epstein's high-powered legal team had to "attempt to affect prosecutorial 
decisions" in this District, Epstein fails to provide any other alternative. Thus, partial rescission 
of the NPA's immunity provisions is the only remedial option before the Court that comes close 
to permitting the Court to discharge its obligation to "ensure" that victims are afforded their rights. 
U.S.C. § 3771(b)(1). It is only after rescission of the immunity provisions pertaining to them 
that Jane Doe 1 and 2 will receive "the full unfettered exercise of their conferral rights at a time 
that will enable [them] to exercise those rights meaningfully." DE 189 at 9 (citing U.S. v. BP 
Products North America, Inc., 2008 WL 501321 at *14 (S.D. Tex. 2008)); see also Kenna v. United 
Jane Doe 1 and 2 continue to assert their position that, if partial rescission is not possible 
for some reason, then total rescission is required. DE 464 at 30-36.

States District Court, 435 F.3d 1011, 1017 (9th Cir. 2006) (when trial court denied a victim his 
right to give a statement at the defendant's sentencing, the trial court must be "cognizant that the 
only way to give effect to [the victim's] right to speak . . . is to vacate the sentence and hold a new 
sentencing hearing"). Any other conclusion would require the Court to approve the illegal bargain 
struck by Epstein and the USAO-SDFL. After the passage of the CVRA, the Court is simply not 
permitted to approve a violation of crime victims' rights. 
II. 
THE CVRA AUTHORIZES RESCISSION AS A REMEDY. 
Intervenor Epstein next argues that the "CVRA itself' precludes a rescission remedy. 
Epstein Remedies Br. at 27-33. The Court has already ruled to the contrary, and nothing in 
Epstein's legal arguments should cause the Court to reverse course. 
A. 
The CVRA Authorizes Rescission as a Remedy. 
Intervenor Epstein's first argument is a purely legal argument — that the CVRA's plain 
language somehow restricts the Court from rescinding provisions in the NPA as a remedy in this 
case. But Epstein's argument ultimately boils down to the proposition that a provision that 
contains a limitation on a victim making "a motion to re-open a plea or sentence" (18 U.S.C. § 
3771 (d)(5) (emphasis added)) somehow restricts the ability of a victim to make a motion regarding 
a right to confer regarding a non-prosecution agreement. To the contrary, as this Court has held, 
the fact that the CVRA permits re-opening of pleas and sentences in some circumstances, fully 
confirms that a non-prosecution agreement can likewise be reopened. Moreover, in attempting to 
apply the limitations contained in § 3771(d)(5), Epstein quickly produces a non-sequitur. The 
limitations he cites apply during a court "proceeding" — i.e., the victim must have asserted "the 
right to be heard before or during the proceeding at issue." An NPA can be drafted and signed 
EFTA00022574
--- PAGE 30 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 30 of 70 
before any "proceeding" is held. It is for this reason that the CVRA (as it existed in 2007-0813) 
required an objection during a "proceeding" as a prerequisite to re-opening a plea or sentence — 
but not for an NPA. 
Moreover, distinguishing between a non-prosecution agreement (negotiated outside of the 
court processes) and "plea" and "sentence" makes considerable sense. As this Court explained, 
an "NPA entered into without notice has a more damaging impact on victims than a plea agreement 
entered into without notice. When a plea agreement is entered into without notice, the victim will 
at least have an opportunity to provide input to a judge at sentencing. Once an NPA is entered into 
without notice, the matter is closed and the victims have no opportunity to be heard regarding any 
aspect of the case." 359 F.Supp.3d at 1220 n.7 (emphasis added). 
Unable to provide a logical explanation for his position, Epstein claims that two CVRA 
appellate decisions support him. But both decisions dealt with a separate issue — whether crime 
victims seeking to overturn a district court decision denying enforcement of their rights in appellate 
courts had to shoulder the heavy burden traditionally associated with the "mandamus" relief. See 
U.S. v. Monzel, 641 F.3d 58, 532-33 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (discussing 18 U.S.C. § 3771(d)(3) and 
holding crime victims had to satisfy high mandamus standards); United States v. Hunter, 548 F.3d 
1308, 1315 (10th Cir. 2008) (same). Interestingly, Congress has since essentially overruled both 
of those decisions. See 18 U.S.C. § 3771(d)(3) (2015 amendment) (making clear that crime victims 
Aware of the Government and Epstein's secret maneuvering in this case, in 2015 
Congress amended the CVRA in order to codify this Court's earlier rulings here and ensure that 
victims received timely notice of any NPA. 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(9). In codifying this right, it 
would be hard to imagine that Congress wanted to create for victims a hollow right — one that 
could never be enforced in any way — which is the logical implication of Epstein's position.

Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 31 of 70 
need only satisfy "ordinary" standards of appellate review). But, in any event, these decisions 
discussing appellate issues provide no useful guidance here. 
B. 
The Victims Are Not Time-Barred Under the CVRA. 
Intervenor Epstein also argues that rescission relief is somehow "time-barred." Epstein 
Remedies Br. at 40. Epstein relies upon a provision in the CVRA that states that "[t]he district 
court shall take up and decide any motion asserting a victim's right forthwith." DE 463 at 40 
(citing 18 U.S.C. § 3771(d)(3) (emphasis added)). Epstein, however, has waived any right to 
complain about delay in this case. The Court will recall that back in 2013, Epstein and his lawyers 
tried to assert an alleged "plea negotiation" privilege over various documents. After this Court 
denied their assertion (DE 188) — and denied their motion for a stay pending appeal (DE 206) — 
Epstein and his lawyers succeeded in obtaining an Eleventh Circuit stay of proceedings in this case 
for months. They represented to the Eleventh Circuit that "[t]here will be no prejudice to [the 
victims] from waiting until an appellate court can address the critically important issues at stake 
here." Motion for Stay Pending Appeal, Jane Does v. United States, No. 13-12923 (11th Cir. July 
12, 2013). Having declined to raise — either with this Court or the appellate court — any need for 
a "forthwith" ruling then, Epstein cannot belatedly raise such a claim years later. 
In any event, relief in this case is not time barred. The CVRA's provision requiring this 
Court to "take up and decide any motion asserting a victim's right forthwith," 18 U.S.C. § 
3771(d)(3), is undoubtedly designed to ensure that victims can obtain immediate relief when they 
need it. For example, if a trial is taking place without the presence of the victim, a victim might 
require immediate relief, as otherwise any opportunity for the victim to attend might permanently 
disappear. Cf 18 U.S.C. § 3771(d)(5) (a victim cannot obtain the remedy of a "new trial").

Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 32 of 70 
In this case, this Court acted expeditiously and did take up and decide Jane Doe 1 petition 
(later joined by Jane Doe 2) within just four days of its filing. On July 7, 2008, when counsel for 
Jane Doe I began to learn that a secret, non-prosecution agreement might be in the works, they 
filed an "emergency" petition for enforcement of the Crime Victims' Rights Act. DE 1. Two days 
later, on July 9, 2008, the USAO-SDFL responded. And just two days later, on the morning of 
July 11, 2008, this Court held a hearing. 
During the hearing, victims' counsel discussed what he understood to be a plea deal of 
some sort that was then under negotiation. As counsel explained: "it is my understanding and 
belief that the agreement with the federal government and with the U.S. Attorney's Office wasn't 
signed on that day [i.e., June 30, 2008]. So it is still my belief, I could be wrong, but that that 
agreement hasn't been completed as of this time." See Tr. (July 11, 2008) at 5-6 (emphasis added). 
Victims' counsel went on to say that, if the Court were make the assumption that an agreement 
had already been reached, then the Court should "[o]rder that the agreement that was negotiated is 
invalid and it is illegal as it did not pertain to [or uphold] the rights of the victim[s]." Id. at 6. 
Thereafter, the Government disclosed that it had, in fact, reached a secret agreement with Epstein 
months earlier. Id. at 8. 
Victims counsel then pushed to have the agreement invalidated. The Court explored the 
posture of the case, deciding that the issues no longer required any "emergency" treatment because 
Epstein had entered into the NPA long ago: 
THE COURT: In view of the fact that this agreement has already been 
consummated, and you want me to set it aside, as opposed to something that's about 
to occur, would you agree that-- and I have done this very quickly because of the 
petition and your allegation that something was about to happen. I'm not blaming 
you. 
MR. EDWARDS: I was mistaken. 
EFTA00022577
--- PAGE 33 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 33 of 70 
THE COURT: I'm not blaming you for doing that. In view of what you 
know now, is there any need to treat this as an emergency that has to be decided by 
tomorrow? 
MR. EDWARDS: I can't think of any reason in light of what we just heard 
[i.e., that the NPA had been signed eight or nine months earlier]. 
THE COURT: Mr. Lee, do you have anything else you wanted to add? Does 
either side think I need to take evidence about anything? If I do, since this is not an 
emergency anymore, I can probably find a more convenient time to do that. I don't 
have the time today to take evidence. But if you do believe that I should take 
evidence on this issue. 
MR. EDWARDS: It may be best if I conferred with the U.S. Attorney's 
Office on that and we can make a decision whether it is necessary or whether Your 
Honor deemed it was necessary for you to make a decision. 
THE COURT: I want to know what your respective positions are because it 
may be something in terms of having a complete record, and this is going to be an 
issue that's is going to go to the Eleventh Circuit, [it] may be better to have a 
complete record as to what your position is and the government's is as to what 
actions were taken. . . . And because it is not an emergency, I don't have to do 
something quickly, we can play it by ear and make this into a more complete record 
for the court of appeals. 
See Tr. (July 11, 2008) at 25-26. 
As this recitation of events makes clear, the Court fully discharged its duty to "take up and 
decide" a victim's motion "forthwith." Acting quickly, the Court held a hearing less than four 
days after the petition was filed and decided, with the agreement of both parties to the action (i.e., 
Jane Doe 1 and 2 and the USAO-SDFL) that the appropriate course of action was to develop a full 
evidentiary record of the events surrounding the NPA and whether the victims were entitled to 
invalidation of the agreement secretly reached months earlier. 
Given his vast resources, Epstein was likely aware that all this was happening that same 
day. In any event, the record is clear that the USAO-SDFL quickly notified Epstein of these 
proceedings, because disclosure of Epstein's then-secret NPA was involved. Id. at 30. As noted 
above, the NPA directly provided that, if the USAO-SDFL was going to disclose the agreement, 
it was required to "provide notice to Epstein before making that disclosure." NPA at p. 5 ¶ 13. 
EFTA00022578
--- PAGE 34 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 34 of 70 
So if Epstein had thought that, after July 11, 2008, some quicker resolution of the matter was 
required, he was certainly free to press this point. He made no such argument — which must be 
regarded as a deliberate waiver of any right to a more rapid decision that he may have had. To be 
sure, Epstein was serving his jail sentence at that time. But issues surrounding unwinding a 
sentence were always going to exist in this case after Epstein pled guilty on June 30, 2008, because 
his jail sentence started then. Having these issues decided more quickly was something that 
Epstein could have sought — but did not. 
After setting an initial hearing within four days of the petition's filing, the Court continued 
move this case along, setting a hearing on August 25, 2008, to resolve the issue of whether the 
NPA would be turned over to the victims. During the hearing, the USAO-SDFL put on the record 
that they had notified Epstein of the proceedings. Tr. (Aug. 25, 2008) at 8. Epstein, however, did 
not ask to formally participate in the hearing. Nor did he ask to have the issues under litigation — 
including potential invalidation of the NPA — be decided more rapidly. The Court made further 
decisions about how best to proceed, including ordering disclosure of the secret NPA to the 
victims. 14
Thereafter, of course, extended litigation has ensued in this case. A good summary of the 
events between August 2008 and October 2010 is found in Docket Entry 41, in which Jane Doe 1 
and 2 explained that during the summer of 2008, they had been told by the Government that it 
would work with the victims to put together an agreed stipulation of facts. The victims then 
During the hearing, victims' counsel speculated that rescission of the NPA might not be 
in the victims' best interests. DE 27 at 4. Of course, that statement was made before counsel had 
even seen the entire NPA — and after the document's release, counsel moved forward seeking 
rescission. 
EFTA00022579
--- PAGE 35 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 35 of 70 
provided a set of facts, after which the Government reversed course and decided that it did not 
want to discuss what had happened. See DE 41 at 2-3 (citing DE 19 at 2). Because of the 
Government's decision not to work with Jane Doe 1 and 2 to develop a factual record, the victims 
had to attempt to secure that information from other sources — an effort that proved to be an arduous 
process. DE 41 at 3. Ultimately, on June 30, 2010, Jane Doe 1 and 2 were able to secure some 
correspondence between Epstein and the Government regarding the NPA's negotiation — 
correspondence proving that there "had been an orchestrated decision to deny them their rights." 
DE 41 at 1; see also DE 39 at 3-4. And thereafter in this case, the USAO-SDFL (and Epstein in 
some instances) proceeded to raise one objection after another, producing years of delay. 
While Epstein was obviously aware of this case — and that the ultimate objective was 
(among other things) invalidation of the NPA — he did not move to intervene in the case until 
September 2, 2011 (DE 93), and even then he sought only "limited" intervention with regard to 
remedy. 
In arguing that relief for the victims is now somehow "time-barred," Epstein refers to the 
effects of "missing a deadline." DE 463 at 42. In this case, the victims have missed no deadline. 
As soon as they had an inkling about a secret plea deal, Jane Doe 1 and 2 filed an emergency 
petition for review. And this Court has missed no deadline. It held a hearing on the initial petition 
in less than four days and took up and decided how the victims' petition would be handled. 
Thereafter, the proceedings unfolded in accordance with scheduling sought by the two parties. 
And Epstein has never raised a peep about any of this scheduling — until his filing two weeks ago. 
Moreover, it is more than a little ironic to see Epstein complaining that issues regarding 
the NPA have not been resolved more quickly. Of course, it was Epstein himself who set in motion 
EFTA00022580
--- PAGE 36 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 36 of 70 
all the events designed to keep the NPA concealed from the victims. If he had not persuaded the 
Government to deviate from its standard practice of keeping victims fully informed, all the issues 
surrounding the NPA could have been presented before he pled guilty in state court. Of course, it 
was precisely to keep that court — and the victims - from learning about the NPA that Epstein 
arranged to have the NPA shrouded in secrecy. Any passage of time in litigating these issues is 
directly attributable to Epstein's maneuverings. 
Finally, even if the Court were to conclude that somehow the "forthwith" deadline in this 
case had been missed, that fact would not allow it to refuse to enforce Jane Doe 1 and 2's CVRA 
rights now. The U.S. Supreme Court has explored a similar question of a missed deadline in 
connection with restitution for crime victims. Dolan v. United States, 560 U.S. 605 (2010), 
involved the effect of a district court missing a 90-day deadline for awarding restitution. Dolan 
held that the restitution statute's primary purpose was "to ensure that victims of a crime receive 
full restitution." Id. at 612. In setting a 90-day requirement, "the statute seeks speed primarily to 
help the victims of crime and only secondarily to help the defendant." Id. at 613. 
Of course, in this case, precisely the same focus on victims exists. Naturally, the purpose 
of the Crime Victims' Rights Act is to help crime victims. And the reason Congress required that 
rulings should be "forthwith" was to help victims. As Senator Kyl explained, "[t]he enforcement 
provisions of this bill ensure that never again are victim's rights provided in word but not in 
reality." 150 Cong. Rec. S4260-01 (Apr. 22, 2004). It would invert the purposes of the statute to 
allow a criminal like Epstein to take advantage of a "forthwith" enforcement provision added to 
help victims. And, indeed, the CVRA blocks his attempt, providing that "[a] person accused of 
EFTA00022581

Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 37 of 70 
the crime may not obtain any font: of relief under this chapter." 18 U.S.C. § 3771(d)(1) (emphasis 
added). 
Finally, to the extent that the "forthwith" provision has some application to Epstein, he 
could have brought that claim to the attention of this Court long ago. As the Supreme Court noted 
in connection with the 90-day requirement in Dolan, a defendant who is worried about the need 
for prompt action "can usually avoid additional delay simply by pointing to the statute and asking 
the court to grant a timely hearing." 560 U.S. at 616. The same thing is true in this case. Epstein 
could have, at any time, simply pointed to the "forthwith" provision and asked for a quick hearing. 
He did not do so. As in Dolan, reading the CVRA to require Epstein to have raise this argument 
imposes on him only a "small cost" relative "to the prospect of depriving innocent crime victims" 
of their CVRA rights. Id. 
III. 
PRINCIPLES OF CONTRACT LAW SUPPORT A RESCISSION REMEDY. 
Intervenor Epstein next argues that "principles of contract law" preclude a rescission 
remedy to enforce the victims' CVRA rights. Epstein's Remedy Br. at 33-36. The USAO-SDFL 
had raised a similar contract law argument and, to avoid duplicative briefing, Jane Doe 1 and 2 
simply incorporate by reference their previous responses. DE 464 at 19-26. But a few additional 
words are appropriate in response to Epstein's specific claims. 
A. 
Under the CVRA, Contract Law Principles Require Rescission. 
Epstein begins by citing a series of Florida state law cases. Epstein Remedies Br. at 33-
34. But Epstein never provides the legal predicate for his argument — that is, why this Court should 
decide this case under Florida contact law. To the contrary, this case is controlled by an Act of 
Congress, setting out federally protected rights for crime victims. In the Crime Victims' Rights 
EFTA00022582
--- PAGE 38 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 38 of 70 
Act, Congress has directed that this Court "shall ensure" that victims' CVRA rights are fully 
protected. 18 U.S.C. § 3771(b)(1). Even if Florida contract law were to the contrary (a point Jane 
Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2 disprove below), the only way this Court can "ensure" the protection of Jane 
Doe 1 and 2's right to confer about prosecuting Epstein's (and his coconspirators') sex crimes in 
the Southern District of Florida is to rescind the immunity provisions. As this Court has explained, 
rescission of these provision is required so that the victims can have "the full unfettered exercise 
of their conferral rights at a time that will enable the victims to exercise those rights meaningfully." 
DE 189 at 9. 
Congress did not expect that victims' rights might be stripped away through contract law 
principles. To the contrary, as Senator Kyl explained, "it is the clear intent and expectation of 
Congress that the district . . . courts will establish procedures that will allow for a prompt 
adjudication of any issues regarding the assertion of a victim's right, while giving meaning to the 
rights we establish." 150 Cong. Rec. 22953 (Oct. 9, 2004) (statement of Sen. Kyl) (emphases 
added). Accordingly, this Court's remedial task is not to ensure that the NPA conforms to ill-
defined contract law "principles" but rather to give meaning to the rights of victims to confer with 
the USAO-SDFL. To put it bluntly, a congressional command simply takes precedence over any 
"principles" of contract law that Epstein can cite. 
But if anything, standard contract law principles support Jane Doe 1 and 2's request for a 
rescission remedy. This Court has held that "[p]ublic policy empowers this Court to decline 
enforcement of a contract" that is contrary to law. Neiman v. Provident Life & Accident Ins. Co., 
217 F.Supp.2d 1281, 1286 (S.D. Fla. 2002) (citing United Papenvorkers Intl Union v. Misco, 
Inc., 484 U.S. 29, 42 (1987)). Thus, as this Court has explained, under "Florida law, a contract 
EFTA00022583
--- PAGE 39 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 39 of 70 
that violates public policy is void and unenforceable." Neiman, 217 F.Supp.2d at 1286 (citing 
Harris v. Gonzalez, M.D., 789 So.2d 405, 409 (Fla. 4th DCA 2001)). 
Here, the Court would violate "public policy" — indeed, an Act of Congress, i.e., the Crime 
Victims' Rights Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3771 — to uphold the NPA's immunity provisions, which prevent 
the victims from being able to exercise their CVRA right to confer with the USAO-SDFL. The 
public policy Congress announced in the CVRA invalidates practices whereby victims "were kept 
in the dark by prosecutors too busy to care ... and by a court system that simply did not have place 
for them." 150 Cong Rec. 7296 (April 22, 2004) (statement of Sen. Feinstein). The CVRA 
demands that the Court award a rescission remedy in response to the prosecutors and Epstein 
keeping the victims "in the dark." 
Intervenor Epstein complains that a rescission remedy would violate contract law, because 
rescission does not restore him to the "status quo." Epstein Remedies Br. at 34. After all, Epstein 
notes, he has now served his jail time under the agreement. Id. But it can equally be said that not 
imposing a rescission remedy fails to restore Jane Doe 1 and 2 to the "status quo" to which they 
were entitled. Under the CVRA, they were entitled to confer with the prosecutors before any 
immunity deal was struck with Epstein. The Court is thus faced with a choice — it can either protect 
Epstein's (illegally obtained) immunity deal; or it can give Jane Doe 1 and 2 (and other victims) 
the CVRA rights Congress has conferred on them. This Court must act to protect the statutorily 
protected rights of victims rather than ill-defined "principles" of contract law that Epstein finds 
useful. 
Epstein also contends that a rescission remedy is akin to "reformation of a contract," 
Epstein Remedies Br. at 45, and thus must "conform" to the intention of the parties to the NPA. 
EFTA00022584
--- PAGE 40 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 40 of 70 
But, of course, the NPA was affirmatively concealed from the victims. It is precisely because the 
NPA was clandestine that this Court must now rescind its immunity provisions. It was never the 
intention of the victims to extend immunity to Epstein. 
Thus, reformation principles are 
inapplicable. 
Epstein also rattles the sword that a rescission remedy would somehow imperil financial 
payments that he has previously made to his victims under the NPA. Epstein Remedies Br. at 34-
35. Many victims — including Jane Doe 1 and 2 — did not receive any financial benefits from the 
NPA. Instead, they negotiated other financial terms without relying on the NPA. So, Epstein 
would have no basis for seeking return of any moneys he paid them. But even with regard to 
victims who relied on the financial provisions of the NPA, the "partial" rescission remedy that 
Jane Doe 1 and 2 seek would not call into question Epstein's payments. The NPA's financial 
provisions can only be invalidated if someone asks for them to be invalidated. Jane Doe 1 and 2 
have not asked for that remedy. And neither did the USAO-SDFL, who would in any event lack 
"standing" to make such a request. See DE 464 at 27-28. Intervenor Epstein is the only party to 
the NPA who could ask for total rescission of the agreement — and he has declined to do.15 Thus, 
as noted above, the Court's choice is between either (1) affirming an illegal agreement or (2) 
rescinding provisions that block certain victims from being able to exercise their CVRA rights — 
the partial rescission remedy Jane Doe 1 and 2 lay out. Between those two choices, the Court must 
clearly act to protect the victims. Cf. Neiman, 217 F.Supp.2d at 1286 (refusing to enforce contract 
provision where doing so "would validate a ... [provision] founded in illegality"). 
" Epstein does refer, at one point, to the "government's view" that financial payments 
might be placed at risk through a rescission remedy. Epstein Remedies Br. at 35. But he never 
adopts that argument or ask this Court to adopt a "total rescission" remedy. 
EFTA00022585
--- PAGE 41 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 41 of 70 
Once again, this conclusion is required by binding Eleventh Circuit case law. The Eleventh 
Circuit has instructed that in order for any provision in a plea agreement to be enforceable, "there 
must have been a valid, binding agreement in the first instance ...." San Pedro v. United States, 
F.3d 1065, 1068 (11th Cir. 1996). In this case, with respect to the NPA's immunity provisions, 
there never was a "valid, binding" agreement because the USAO-SDFL was not lawfully able to 
offer such an agreement. Under the CVRA, it had to first confer with the victims. 
On the other hand, with regard to the NPA's financial provisions, there was a "valid, 
binding" agreement that obligated Epstein to make payments to those victims who want the 
payment provisions enforced. The USAO-SDFL and Epstein were free to agree on those particular 
terms. And, to the extent contract law is relevant, there would clearly be consideration supporting 
those terms, since under the partial rescission that Jane Doe 1 and 2 propose, Epstein would still 
continue to have the right to immunity from prosecution in the Southern District of Florida for any 
victim who declined to ask for a rescission remedy.16 As a result, "consideration" for the contract 
(e.g., the NPA) would still exist, because something of value would exist for both sides. See 
RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACTS § 79.17
This argument assumes only that at least one of the dozens and dozens of Epstein Florida 
victims would not seek rescission of the immunity provision connected with her case. In the 
unlikely event that all of Epstein's victims unanimously demand rescission, then a different 
circumstance might arise. The Court could address those circumstances if they ever occurred. 
It may also be the case that Epstein retains some "consideration" for his NPA, because 
the statute of limitations may have now expired on some of the crimes covered by his NPA. The 
Court need not reach that issue, however, because other consideration exists. And Epstein's most 
serious crimes covered by the NPA — specifically, the sex trafficking charges — are not time barred, 
due to congressional extensions of the statutes of limitations. 
See 18 U.S.C. § 3299 
("Notwithstanding any other law, an indictment may be found . . at any time without limitation 
for any . . . felony under chapter 109A, 110 (except for section[s] 2257 and 2257A), or 117, or 
section 1591")).

Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 42 of 70 
Epstein also suggests that, if a partial rescission remedy is awarded, then he would be free 
to raise a "collateral attack" on his state court guilty plea. Epstein Remedies Br. at 46. Of course, 
whether he would be successful in doing so is dubious. Florida state courts take a dim view of 
belated challenges to guilty pleas. See, e.g., Guzman-Aviles v. State, 226 So. 3d 339, 346 (Fla. 5th 
DCA 2017) ("Every inroad on the concept of finality undermines confidence in the integrity of 
our procedure . . . .The impact is greatest when new grounds for setting aside guilty pleas are 
approved because the vast majority of criminal convictions result from such pleas. Moreover, the 
concern that unfair procedures may have resulted in the conviction of an innocent defendant is 
only rarely raised by a petition to set aside a guilty plea."). But any collateral attack would 
ultimately be an issue for the Florida state courts — not this Court. The only issue for this Court is 
whether to enforce the CVRA — and Congress has commanded that it must. 18 U.S.C. § 
3771(b)(1). And after rescission, given that prosecuting sex trafficking is a high priority of the 
Justice Department, we assume that the USAO-SDFL would quickly prosecute Epstein in this 
District on serious federal sex trafficking charges — charges that the victims could help explain to 
the prosecutors. DE 464 at 33-34. 
Epstein also argues that "the NPA is not a divisible agreement." Epstein Remedies Br. at 
46. But the NPA provision he cites does not say that. Instead, it simply provides that each of the 
NPA's provisions is "material" to the agreement and is supported "by independent consideration." 
NPA at p. 6. If Epstein had wanted an "indivisible" NPA (whatever that may mean), he was free 
to bargain for one. But nothing in the NPA's language provides that it is "indivisible." 
In any event, Jane Doe 1 and 2 are not arguing that the NPA is some sort of "divisible" 
agreement. Rather, their position is that the NPA's immunity provisions are unenforceable and 
EFTA00022587
--- PAGE 43 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 43 of 70 
must be rescinded. Epstein argues that the immunity provisions must be specifically enforced. 
But Florida law recognizes that "[s]pecific performance [of a contract] will be denied when the 
rights of innocent third parties have intervened so that enforcement of the contract would be harsh, 
oppressive, or unjust to them." Seaboard Oil Co. v. Donovan, 99 Fla. 1296, 1306, 128 So. 821, 
825 (1930) (citing 6 POMEROY EQUITY JURISPRUDENCE, § 794). Obviously, it is unjust to Jane 
Doe 1 and 2 to enforce immunity provisions in the NPA depriving them of congressionally 
guaranteed rights. 
Finally, Epstein never specifically asks this Court to rule that the NPA is "indivisible" and 
therefore must be declared void in its entirely. As noted above, the reason that Epstein has chosen 
not to ask for the NPA to be declared totally invalid is obvious — he apparently intends to try to 
use the NPA's immunity provisions in the Southern District of New York.18 But the key point 
remains that Epstein has waived any opportunity to ask for total rescission. The Court accordingly 
must choose between no rescission and partial rescission. The CVRA commands a choice in favor 
of the victims. 
B. 
The Civil Releases Signed by Jane Doe I and 2 Did Not — and Could Not —
Waive their CVRA Claims Against the Government. 
Intervenor Epstein next contends that Jane Doe 1 and 2 have somehow signed releases in 
a civil case that bar a rescission remedy in this criminal case. Epstein Remedies Br. at 37-38. His 
argument is specious. 
Equally obvious are the reasons why Epstein has declined to have the financial 
compensation provisions declared invalid. Doing so would expose him to compensatory and 
punitive damages claims that, for each victim, would be worth tens of millions of dollars. See DE 
464 at 34.

Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 44 of 70 
Epstein points to civil releases signed by Jane Doe 1 and 2 that resolved their civil cases 
against Epstein. The terms of those releases plainly do not cover this case against the Government, 
seeking to enforce their rights in a criminal investigation. As Epstein's own exhibits makes clear, 
the release covers only claims for "compensatory or punitive damages": 
[Jane Doe] individually, and Jeffrey Epstein, individually (jointly referred 
to as "Parties"), enter into this Settlement Agreement and General Release 
("Settlement Agreement") in order to resolve the pending litigation against them as 
follows: 
2. 
General Release. 
[Jane Doe] and her agent(s), attomey(s), 
predecessor(s), successor(s) heir(s), administrator(s), and/or assign(s) (hereinafter 
"First Parties"), for and in consideration of the sum of [redacted] and other valuable 
consideration, received from or on behalf of Jeffrey Epstein and his agent(s), 
attomey(s), predecessor(s), successor(s), heir(s), administrator(s), assign(s) and/or 
employee(s) (hereinafter, "Second Parties"), the receipt whereof is hereby 
acknowledge, 
HEREBY remise, release, acquit, satisfy, and forever discharge the said 
Second Parties and any other person or entity would could have been included as a 
potential defendant ("Other Potential Defendants") from all, and all manner of, 
action and actions of [Jane Doe], including State or Federal, cause and causes of 
action (common law or statutory), suits, debts, dues, sum of money, accounts, 
reckoning, bonds, bills, specialties, covenants, contracts, controversies, 
agreements, promises, variances, trespasses, damages, judgments, executions, 
claims, and demands whatsoever in law or in equity for compensatory or punitive 
damages that said First Parties ever had or now have, or that any personal 
representative, successor, heir, or assign of said First Parties hereafter can, shall, or 
may have, against Jeffrey Epstein, or Other Potential Defendants, for, upon, or by 
reason of any matter, cause, or thing whatsoever (whether or known or unknown), 
from the beginning of the world to the day of this release. 
DE 463-4. While the release is lengthy, what is being released is clear: claims "for compensatory 
or punitive damages" against Epstein. Of course, this CVRA action does not seek any civil 
"damages" against Epstein (or anyone else, for that matter). Accordingly, the release's plain 
language makes clear it is inapplicable to this case. 
EFTA00022589
--- PAGE 45 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 45 of 70 
It is troubling that, in discussing this release, Epstein chooses to use ellipses to conceal the 
critical language about the release being limited to "compensatory or punitive damages." Thus, in 
Epstein's recounting of the tale, the general releases encompassed all "claims, and demands 
whatsoever in law or in equity ... for, upon, or by reasons of any matter, cause or thing whatsoever 
(whether known or unknown), from the beginning of the world to the day of this release." Epstein 
Remedies Br. at 47 (ellipses in original). Notice the ellipses — which remove the pivotal 
"compensatory or punitive damages" language. The Court should not permit such misleading 
briefing to carry the day. Cf. Loeffel Steel Prod., Inc. v. Delta Brands, Inc., 387 F. Supp. 2d 794, 
823 (N.D. Ill. 2005) ("ellipses are not a cure for misquotation and indeed are often the vehicle for 
misleading. See Posner, OVERCOMING LAW, 277 (1995) ("Beware a [lawyer] bearing ellipses.")). 
This CVRA rights enforcement action does not involve any claim for damages — much less, 
a claim for damages against Epstein.19 As Jane Doe 1 and 2 made clear in their initial remedies 
submission, they "are aware, of course, that the CVRA provides that it does not 'authorize a cause 
of action for damages.' 18 U.S.C. § 3771(d)(6). Accordingly, Jane Doe 1 and 2 are not seeking 
'damages' under the CVRA ...." DE 458 at 30 (emphasis added). 
Even if the this case is somehow interpreted to involve "damages," Florida courts have 
made clear that exculpatory clauses are only "enforceable where the intention to be relieved from 
liability was made clear and unequivocal and the wording was so clear and understandable that an 
ordinary and knowledgeable person will know what he or she is contracting away." Sanislo v. 
The release also extends to "Other Potential Defendants," defined as any "other person 
or entity would could have been included as a potential defendant" in the Jane Does lawsuit 
alleging sex abuse. Obviously, the United States was a not sex abuser and could not have been 
included in the lawsuit against Epstein.

Give Kids the World, Inc., 157 So.3d 256, 260-61 (Fla. 2015); see also Fresnedo v. Porky's Gym 
III, Inc., 271 So. 3d 1185, 1186 (Fla. 3d DCA 2019) (releases "that purport to deny an injured 
party the right to recover damages from another who negligently causes injury are strictly 
construed against the party seeking to be relieved of liability"); Diodato v. Islamorada Asset 
Mgmt., Inc., 138 So.3d 513, 517 (Fla. 3d DCA 2014) (reiterating the "well-settled principle that 
[exculpatory] clauses are disfavored and are narrowly construed"). 
As the beginning of the settlement agreement makes clear, "[Jane Doe] individually, and 
Jeffrey Epstein, individually (jointly referred to as "Parties"), enter into this Settlement Agreement 
and General Release ("Settlement Agreement") in order to resolve the pending litigation against 
them ... ." Of course, this CVRA case is not litigation between Jane Doe 1 and 2 and Epstein, but 
rather was (and is) styled as Jane Doe I and 2 v. United States. Thus, in the summer of 2010, 
Epstein was not a party to the CVRA case. He was not even an intervenor at that time. The general 
release that Jane Doe 1 and 2 entered into with Epstein did not apply — much less "clearly and 
unambiguously" apply — to this CVRA case against the United States. 
Confirming this understanding is the fact that, shortly after the civil cases settled, Jane Doe 
and 2 filed a statement with this Court explaining that the settlements of civil cases with Epstein 
in no way affected this CVRA action against the United States: 
The fact that Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 have settled their civil cases against sex 
offender Jeffrey Epstein in no way affects their determination to move forward with 
the above-captioned CVRA action against a different entity — the U.S. Attorney's 
Office for the Southern District of Florida. For reasons explained in their earlier 
pleadings, that Office grossly violated their rights under the Act. The fact that 
Epstein has settled with Jane Doe #1 and #2 to resolve his civil liability in no way 
exonerates the U.S. Attorney's Office for its failure to discharge its responsibilities 
under the Act. 
EFTA00022591
--- PAGE 47 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 47 of 70 
DE 39 at 2. Epstein never argued that this statement was inaccurate, presumably because he knew 
that was what the parties had agreed to. At the time of the settlements, Epstein was well aware of 
the CVRA action against the United States. He chose not to attempt to include that case in the 
release. 
For all these reasons, it is unambiguously clear that the civil release of their "damages" 
claims against Epstein does not bar Jane Doe 1 and 2 from proceeding with their CVRA claim 
against the United States, seeking to vindicate their CVRA rights. Indeed, even if the release had 
dismissed CVRA claims, such a provision would have been void as against public policy. Any 
such CVRA release would let a wealthy defendant (like Epstein20) buy his way out of prison. The 
CVRA applies only to criminal cases. Affluent criminal defendants should not be able to, first, 
illegally conceal an NPA in violation of crime victims' rights and then, second, simply payoff 
victims to avoid having justice done. 
Of course, that is not what happened in this case — as the releases to which Epstein refers 
simply do not cover the CVRA case. But even if they did, they would be obviously contrary to 
clearly announced public policy and unenforceable. As this Court has held, under "Florida law, a 
contract that violates public policy is void and unenforceable." Neiman v. Provident Life & 
Accident Ins. Co., 217 F.Supp.2d 1281, 1286 (S.D. Fla. 2002) (citing Harris v. Gonzalez, M.D., 
789 So.2d 405, 409 (Fla. 4th DCA 2001)). Public policy in Florida (and elsewhere) favors the

reporting of crimes — particularly crimes involving vulnerable child sex abuse victims. See, e.g., 
Valladares v. Bank of Am. Corp., 197 So.3d 1, 10 (Fla. 2016) ("Private citizens should be 
encouraged to become interested and involved in bringing the perpetrators of crime to justice . . . 
."). And, of course, Congress can articulate public policy. The articulated public policy in the 
CVRA is that this Court "shall ensure" that crime victims receive their rights. 18 U.S.C. § 
3771(b)(1). Construing the civil releases the way that Epstein would, obviously violates that 
announced policy of protecting crime victims and promoting prosecution of dangerous criminals. 
IV. 
THE DOCTRINES OF EQUITABLE AND JUDICIAL ESTOPPEL ARE 
INAPPLICABLE. 
Next, convicted sex offender Epstein asks that Court rule against his sex abuse victims 
under the "doctrine" of equitable and judicial estoppel. Epstein Remedies Br. at 3943. Epstein 
claims that Jane Doe 1 and 2 sought to enforce the terms of the NPA against him and, accordingly, 
"[p]rinciples of equitable and judicial estoppel" now somehow preclude them from enforcing the 
CVRA rights. Id. at 40. Epstein's estoppel arguments are meritless.21
A. Jane Doe I and 2 Have Not Violated Any CVRA Requirement in Handling Their 
Petition. 
Intervenor Epstein's first argument is hinges on the fact that the CVRA requires a judicial 
decision on a CVRA motion "forthwith." See id. at 40 (citing 18 U.S.C. § 3771(d)(3)). Epstein 
repeats his earlier argument, as discussed in Section II.B, supra, that Jane Doe 1 and 2 failed to 
obtain a decision "forthwith." But as discussed above, the "forthwith" requirement was fully 
satisfied in this case. The victims initially sought "emergency" relief and then this Court took 
It bears emphasizing that the USAO-SDFL has not raised any estoppel arguments. See 
DE 464 at 67-68. 
EFTA00022593
--- PAGE 49 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 49 of 70 
expeditious action in less than four days on the victims' motion. The CVRA contains no further 
time requirements, so the notion that victims somehow deviated from CVRA requirements is 
untrue. And, in any event, even assuming some sort of violation of the "forthwith" provision, 
Epstein is precluded from taking advantage of it. The CVRA itself provides that "[a] person 
accused of the crime may not obtain any form of relief under this chapter." 18 U.S.C. § 3771(d)(1) 
(emphasis added). 
Moreover, Epstein seems to suggest that the victims somehow, as he puts it, "stymied the 
operation of the CVRA." Epstein Remedies Br. at 40. But it was, of course, Epstein and the 
USAO-SDFL who, in the first instance, "stymied" the CVRA by illegally concealing their NPA. 
Since then, it has been a long and hard road for the victims — and the Court — to fully expose what 
happened. But that Epstein succeeded in keeping the truth concealed for so long provides no basis 
for withholding relief, particularly on alleged grounds of "equity." 
B. Congress Has Not Added Doctrines of Estoppel to the CVRA. 
Intervenor Epstein next resorts to what he describes as "doctrines" of "equitable" and 
"judicial" estoppel. These doctrines will be of some interest to courts sitting in equity. But this 
CVRA enforcement action is not an occasion where the Court is free to craft its own equitable 
rules restricting the CVRA. 
In the CVRA, Congress specifically directed that, when crime victims' issues come before 
a court, "the court shall ensure that the crime victim is afforded the rights described in [the 
CVRA]." 18 U.S.C. § 3771(b) (emphasis added). That mandatory language gives no room for the 
Court to ignore violations of crime victims' rights based on ill-defined notions of "estoppel." As 
the CVRA's legislative history makes clear, "It is not the intent of this bill that its significance be 
EFTA00022594
--- PAGE 50 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 50 of 70 
whittled down or marginalized by the courts . 
." 150 Cong. Rec. 54260-01 (Apr. 22, 2004) 
(statement of CVRA co-sponsor, Sen. Feinstein). Allowing a CVRA violation to go unremedied 
merely because a criminal can point to other competing estoppel considerations could not merely 
"whittle down" the CVRA but completely destroy its effectiveness in some cases. 
Controlling case law makes clear then when construing a remedial scheme for enforcement 
of congressionally created rights, the courts must give "appropriate judicial deference toward the 
will of Congress ...."Hardison v. Cohen, 375 F.3d 1262, 1264 (11th Cir. 2004) (internal quotation 
omitted). Congress is "in a better position to decide whether or not the public interest would be 
served" by expansive or narrow remedies. Id. at 1264. Indeed, where Congress has created a 
substantive right, the generally rule is that such a right "is not subject to equitable tolling or 
equitable estoppel." Fulghum v. Embarq Corp., 785 F.3d 395, 416 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 
136 S. Ct. 537 (2015). If notions of, for example, equitable estoppel are to become part of the 
CVRA, that choice is for Congress — not the courts. 
Moreover, if the Court is going to read into the CVRA doctrines of estoppel, it must also 
read in related defenses - such as the doctrine of "unclean hands." It is well-established that "[o]ne 
defense to the equitable claim of estoppel is the doctrine of `unclean hands!" Bird v. Centennial 
Ins. Co., 11 F.3d 228, 234 (1st Cir. 1993) (citing Peabody Gas & Oil Co. v. Standard Oil Co., 284 
Mass. 87, 187 N.E. 112, 113 (1933) ("[O]ne must come into a court of equity with clean hands in 
order to secure relief....")). Thus, "equity requires that those seeking its protection shall have acted 
fairly and without fraud or deceit as to the controversy in issue." Ellenburg v. Brockway, Inc., 763 
F.2d 1091, 1097 (9th Cir. 1985) (citing Johnson v. Yellow Cab Transit Co., 321 U.S. 383, 387 
(1944)). Here, Epstein — a sex offender who worked with the USAO-SDFL to illegally conceal an

--- PAGE 51 ---
'Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 51 of 70 
NM from minor sex abuse victims — has unclean hands for multiple and obvious reasons — and 
thus is barred from raising estoppel arguments. 
C. 
Epstein Has Failed to Satisfy the Elements of the Equitable Estoppel 
Doctrine. 
In any event, even if some sort of equitable estoppel "doctrine" applied here, Epstein's 
equitable estoppel argument is meritless. Equitable estoppel precludes challenging a document 
only where that party "rel[ies] on the terms of the written agreement in asserting [her] claims." MS 
Dealer Service Corp. v. Franklin, 177 F.3d 942, 947 (11th Cir. 1999). Here, of course, Jane Doe 
I and 2 did not "rely" on the NPA's terms to establish a CVRA violation — in fact, they were 
challenging the terms. Thus, the basic elements of equitable estoppel are simply not in play. 
Moreover, because equitable estoppel requires close assessment of all relevant 
circumstances, it is important to understand the very limited reference the victims made to 
Epstein's NPA in their civil lawsuits. Jane Doe I and 2 filed their civil lawsuits in about September 
2008, only after their CVRA petition had been filed — and had succeeded in forcing the USAO-
SDFL to disclose the previously secret NPA. The victims' civil lawsuits briefly alleged that 
Epstein had agreed that he had sexually abused the various victims and was therefore estopped 
from denying the abuse. See DE 401-2 at 24 (quoting complaint). Of course, in September 2008, 
the CVRA petition had already been filed — but had not yet been finally decided, much less decided 
EFTA00022596
--- PAGE 52 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 52 of 70 
in their favor. Accordingly, the victims (acting through legal counsel) could only speculate as to 
the ultimate outcome of this CVRA case and had to preserve all possible arguments in their civil 
suit. But simply preserving a claim is not the same thing as actually prevailing on a claim — a 
necessary predicate for equitable estoppel. Ultimately, the civil suits that Epstein refers to were 
settled before trial and Epstein does not argue that any dispositive rulings were made against him 
based on the NPA. 
Any other conclusion would convert the equitable estoppel doctrine from one having 
limited scope to one having sweeping implications. Frequently litigants in the early stages of 
litigation must, to preserve their rights, assert multiple arguments that might ultimately prove to 
be inconsistent with positions either taken in the same case or in other litigation. It is only when a 
party actually receives a court ruling based on a particular predicate that estoppel issues even begin 
to come in to play. If the victims had obtained money from Epstein based on a court ruling that he 
was estopped from contesting liability to them by the NPA, then conceivably some of the 
prerequisites for equitable estoppel would have been in place. But until the victims moved for — 
and received — such a ruling, they did nothing more than preserve their rights by simply listing all 
possible arguments in their complaint. 
Preserving arguments is commonplace in modern litigation — not some basis for precluding 
later arguments. A plaintiff, for example, may allege in a complaint that she was harmed by either 
Defendant A or Defendant B — to be sorted out after further discovery. Or a defendant may allege 
that he did not harm the plaintiff but, if he did, the damages were only minimal. These are not 
occasions for equitable estoppel to apply, but simply the routine assertion of potentially diverging 
legal positions that protect the rights of a party. It would hardly be equitable to preclude parties, 
EFTA00022597
--- PAGE 53 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 53 of 70 
who in early stages of court proceedings raises all possible arguments, to somehow later become 
"estopped" from selecting among them. 
D. 
Epstein Has Failed to Satisfy the Elements of the Judicial Estoppel Doctrine. 
Intervenor Epstein also contends that the doctrine of "judicial estoppel" applies, blocking 
the victims from challenging the NPA. Epstein Remedies Br. at 41-42. Once again, his argument 
is meritless. 
For starters, for all the reasons just explained that Epstein's reliance on equitable estoppel 
doctrine fails, his judicial estoppel argument likewise fails. For example, the decision of whether 
to allow a doctrine of judicial estoppel to provide a basis for declining to enforce CVRA's rights 
is for Congress, not the courts. In addition, Epstein has "unclean hands" and cannot raise an 
argument sounding in equity. 
Remarkably, Epstein seeks to rely on this doctrine even though, under Eleventh Circuit 
caselaw, one of the foundational elements for applying the doctrine is proof of "a party's success 
in convincing a court of the earlier position, so that judicial acceptance of the inconsistent later 
position would create the perception that either the earlier or later court was misled." Tampa Bay 
Water v. HDR Engineering, Inc., 731 F.3d 1171, 1182 (11th Cir. 2013)). In this case, even treating 
the filing of a civil court complaint as an earlier "proceeding," Epstein does not even attempt to 
argue that Jane Doe 1 and 2 had "success" in convincing the courts that Epstein was estopped from 
contesting liability. The reason for this is that the victims never reached the point in the civil 
proceedings of making that argument against Epstein — much less, having success by winning the 
argument. Indeed, Epstein vigorously defended liability in those cases. The reason Epstein was 
able to fully contest liability is that the NPA created such a limited remedy for Epstein's victims 
EFTA00022598
--- PAGE 54 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 54 of 70 
that it was, for all practical purposes, meaningless. Jane Doe 1 and 2 never sought summary 
judgment based on the NPA and instead looked forward to fully trying their cases. 
The relevant provision in the NPA is paragraph 9, which provided that if a victim elected 
to sue Epstein exclusively under 18 U.S.C. § 2255, Epstein agreed not to contest liability — "so 
long as the [victim] agrees to waive any other claim for damages, whether pursuant to state, federal, 
or common law." The practical effect of this provision was to cap the victims' claims against 
Epstein to no more than $150,000 (or, Epstein argued, no more than $50,000), the statutory 
maximum under § 2255. Given the horrific abuse that Epstein inflicted on his child sex abuse 
victims, this cap meant that the NPA was essentially meaningless for many of the victims — 
including Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2, who were unwilling to waive all other claims for damages 
and thus had to proceed entirely apart from the NPA to obtain appropriate damages. The victims 
thus never had "success" relying on the NPA's provisions — but could only have success by 
escaping from the limits on liability that the Government had agreed to with the sex offender they 
were pursuing. 
The Supreme Court has clearly held "[a]bsent success in a prior proceeding, a party's later 
inconsistent position introduces no risk of inconsistent court determinations and thus poses little 
threat to judicial integrity." New Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. 742,750-51 (2001). The victims 
never had "success" in arguing that Epstein was estopped from denying that he has abused the 
victims. Indeed, to the contrary, the victims pressed an argument that they were not limited to 
seeking damages under the NPA. Judicial estoppel is not applicable to this course of events. 
Citing a bankruptcy case, Epstein concedes the principles of judicial estoppel are very 
limited. Indeed, Epstein admits that, in bankniptcy proceedings, the Eleventh Circuit "employs a 
EFTA00022599
--- PAGE 55 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 55 of 70 
two-part test to guide district courts in applying judicial estoppel: whether (1) the party took an 
inconsistent position under oath in a separate proceeding, and (2) these inconsistent positions were 
calculated to make a mockery of the judicial system." Slater v. United States Steel Corp. 871 F.3d 
1174, 1181 (11th Cir. 2017) (internal quotation omitted). 
It should be remembered that Jane Doe 1 and 2 were confronting unprecedented secrecy 
and violation of a congressional statute in trying to determine how to proceed. But Epstein gamely 
argues that Jane Doe 1 and 2 made "a mockery of the judicial system [by] trying to convince one 
court to rule in their favor based on the binding validity of the NPA and then trying to convince 
this Court that the NPA was an `illegal agreement.' Epstein Remedies Br. at 52. Epstein never 
cites that specific document or argument in which Jane Doe 1 or 2 tried to somehow "convince 
one court to rule in their favor" based on the NPA — and, indeed, this Court in fact had an essentially 
identical case in front of it during the entire time where no such actions took place. See Doe v. 
Epstein, 9:08-cv-80893-KAM (S.D. Fla. 2009-10). The reason that Epstein is unable to cite any 
such example is that no such reliance on the NPA ever happened. For example, Jane Doe 1 and 2 
never moved for summary judgment on liability in their civil cases — they were looking forward 
to ultimately trying their case to a jury. And when they tried their cases to a jury, the victims 
intended to call witnesses and fully prove that Epstein had sexually abused them — and then to seek 
compensatory and punitive damages far in excess of what the NPA provided. No reliance on the 
NPA ever existed, much less the kind of improper behavior that would make a "mockery" of the 
system. 
Cf. Slater, 871 F.3d at 1178 (discussing deliberate concealment of claims from a 
bankruptcy court). 
EFTA00022600
--- PAGE 56 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 56 of 70 
Moreover, all of the actions in the CVRA case and the civil cases took place in public 
judicial proceedings in which Epstein was represented by a battery of lawyers. It "is difficult to 
impute an intent `to make a mockery of the judicial system' where the complaining party was 
aware of the inconsistency in sufficient time and in a position to properly raise an objection in the 
original proceeding." Ajaka v. Brooksamerica Mortg. Corp., 453 F.3d 1339, 1345 (11th Cir. 
2006). Here, Epstein and the Government was well aware of both this CVRA action and the related 
civil suits. There is no concealment or unfairness that are the hallmarks for applying judicial 
estoppel. Cf. Burnes v. Pemco Aeroplex, Inc., 291 F.3d 1282 (11th Cir. 2002) (applying doctrine 
in circumstances showing deliberate concealment of assets). 
Instead of presenting evidence (such as a court ruling) that Jane Doe 1 and 2 had "success" 
in relying on the NPA's provisions, Epstein appeals vaguely to the notion that Jane Doe 1 and 2 
"reaped for themselves the financial benefits of the NPA . . . ." Epstein's Remedies Br. at 42. 
What benefits? Jane Doe 1 and 2 settled their civil cases — and obtained benefits entirely apart 
from the NPA. The circumstances in which judicial estoppel would even potentially be in play 
did not occur. 
V. 
ALLEGED PRINCIPLES OF "SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS" DO NOT 
PRECLUDE RESCISSION REMEDIES. 
As his fifth argument against giving Jane Doe 1 and 2 their rights, Intervenor Epstein 
contends it would violate "principles of substantive due process" to rescind the NPA's immunity 
provisions. Epstein Remedies Br. at 43-45. In making his argument, Epstein cites run of the mill 
cases in which the issue is interpretation of a plea agreement. Of course, the Government must

Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 57 of 70 
generally abide by promises that it makes in such agreements. See, e.g., United States v. Hill, 643 
F.3d 807, 874 (11th Cir. 2011) (analyzing scope of government promises in a plea agreement). 
But as the Eleventh Circuit (and other courts) have made clear, this general rule that the 
Government is bound by plea provisions is subject to qualifications. The key case on this point is 
the Eleventh Circuit's decision in San Pedro v. United States, 79 F.3d 1065 ( I 1th Cir. 1996), cited 
previously by Jane Doe 1 and 2 but not discussed by Epstein. San Pedro explains that: "[T]he 
general rule requiring governmental adherence to promises made during plea negotiations is 
subject to two conditions. First, the agent making the promise must be authorized to do so, and 
second, the defendant must detrimentally rely on the promise. If either condition is lacking, then 
the agreement is unenforceable .. . ." San Pedro v. United States, 79 F.3d 1065, 1068 (11th Cir. 
1996); see also United States v. Kachkar, No. 16-20595-CR, 2018 WL 6974948 at *2 (S.D. Fla. 
2018), report and recommendation adopted, No. 16-20595-CR, 2019 WL 116864 (S.D. Fla. 2019) 
(following San Pedro). 
Here, of course, in adopting the CVRA Congress directed that prosecutors must reasonably 
"confer" with the victim in a criminal case before making a binding resolution. 18 U.S.C. § 
3771 (a)(5). Prosecutors lack authority to deviate from this congressional command — and thus (at 
least on the facts of this case) lacked "actual authority to make" a promise of immunity without 
conferring with victims. San Pedro, 795 F.3d at 1068. The word "authority" means "[t]he official 
right or permission to act, esp. to act legally on another's behalf ...." BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 
158 (10'h ed. 2014) (emphasis added). Here, as the Court has previously found (without challenge 
from Epstein) "once the Government failed to advise the victims about its intention to enter into 
the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred." 359 F.Supp.3d at 1221. In other words, the 
EFTA00022602
--- PAGE 58 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 58 of 70 
Government was no longer acting legally — and simply did not have authority to extend immunity 
to Epstein. 
The facts of San Pedro offer clear parallels to this case. There, the prosecutor offered a 
promise of non-deportation to criminal defendant San Pedro. The Eleventh Circuit concluded that 
this agreement was unenforceable, because by statute the power to enforce immigration laws rested 
with the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Id. (citing 8 U.S.C. § 1103(a)). 
Here, Congress has also placed statutory limitations on the power of prosecutors, 
specifically the USAO-SDFL — requiring it to follow the law. The statute establishing the duties 
of the Office of U.S. Attorney provides that "Wrcept as otherwise provided by law, each United 
States attorney, within his district, shall. . . prosecute for all offenses against the United States .. 
.." 28 U.S. § 547 (emphasis added). Thus, here the USAO-SDFL had authority to make prosecutorial 
decisions about this District but had to proceed as "provided by law." See 28 U.S. § 547. One law — 
the CVRA — required the USAO-SDFL to confer with victims before extending Epstein's immunity 
offer. Because that was not done — a fact that Epstein well knew, and indeed had sought — the USAO-
SDFL was without authority to extend the secret immunity offer. 
The fact that Epstein was represented by a multitude of high-powered lawyers is also relevant. 
"This case does not involve any government overreaching by taking advantage of an unsophisticated 
defendant." United States v. Friedland, 83 F.3d 1531, 1539 (3d Cir. 1996). Instead, Epstein and the 
USAO-SDFL sought to maneuver around the statutory commands of the CVRA. Now that their 
maneuver has failed, Epstein is not entitled to take advantage of his illegal agreement. 
This conclusion follows even if the Court were to proceed on the assumption (contrary to the 
facts of this case) that Epstein's legal team had no knowledge whatsoever that the Government was 
violating its CVRA obligations. A helpful case is United States v. Walker, 98 F.3d 944 (7th Cir. 1996). 
EFTA00022603
--- PAGE 59 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 59 of 70 
There, the Seventh Circuit refused to enforce a provision in a plea agreement where "the parties' 
bargain was founded on a mutual misunderstanding of the legal consequences of the bargain. 
Alternatively and equivalently, it is a case in which the bargain is vitiated by illegality — an attempt to 
attach an unauthorized consequence to an inappropriate order." Id. at 946. Even assuming arguendo 
that this case simply involves Epstein and the USAO-SDFL reaching an agreement based on a "mutual 
misunderstanding," the fact remains that the NPA continues to be "vitiated by illegality" and this Court 
cannot attach any effect to the improper agreement. 
In response to Walker, Epstein calls the Seventh Circuit's ruling an "entirely confused" 
decision. Epstein Remedies Br. at 25. But the Seventh Circuit simply followed standard principles 
that a court must follow the law when interpreting plea agreements. Indeed, numerous cases hold that 
such agreements are unenforceable when they deviate from legal requirements. See, e.g., Craig v. 
People, 986 P.2d 951, 959-60 (Colo. 1999) (court cannot enforce a plea agreement that waives the 
mandatory parole period); State v. Garcia, 582 N.W.2d 879, 881-82 (Minn. 1998) (plea agreement 
promised a sentence that did not contain the statutorily-required 10-year conditional release term); 
State v. Wall, 348 N.C. 671, 675-76 (1998) (holding that court cannot enforce a plea agreement for 
concurrent sentence where law mandated consecutive one); Ex parte Rich, 194 S.W.3d 508, 515 (Tex. 
Crim. App. 2006) (court cannot enforce an illegal sentence below the statutory range); State v. 
Mazzone, 212 W.Va. 368, 374 (2002) (court would not enforce plea agreement that called for court to 
unlawfully sentence the defendant by treating two misdemeanor offenses as felony offenses). 
Epstein acknowledges this long line of cases but claims that they are all distinguishable because 
they stand for the proposition that "a court cannot enforce facially invalid plea agreements that contain 
illegal terms or omit the required components of a sentence." Epstein Remedies Br. at 26. Epstein's 
concession effectively gives away the game. Epstein never explains why the principles expressed in 
EFTA00022604
--- PAGE 60 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 60 of 70 
these cases should be limited to "facially" invalid agreement. Here this Court has held that the NPA 
was reached in violation of congressional command, which equally renders it plainly illegal — and thus 
unenforceable. 
Craig v. People, 986 P.2d 951 (Colo. 1999), for example, explains that when "the parties 
attempt to fashion a sentence that is itself contrary to law, the resulting illegality is not subject to 
specific enforcement." Id. at 959. Here, Epstein and the USAO-SDFL attempted to "fashion" an NPA 
that was "contrary to law"— because it was reached without the congressionally required conferral with 
Epstein's victims. 
Similarly, State v. Wall, 348 N.C. 671 1998), holds that the defendant was not entitled to 
specific performance of a plea agreement to receive a concurrent sentence, because "such action would 
violate the laws of this state." Id. at 676. So too here. To allow Epstein to obtain specific performance 
of the secret NPA would "violate the laws of this" country — i.e., the Crime Victims' Rights Act. 
Directly contrary to Epstein's theory that "facial invalidity" only applies to the specific terms 
of an agreement is Ex parte Rich, 194 S.W.3d 508 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006). There, the Court refused 
specific performance of an illegal arrangement, explaining that "[a]lthough the plea bargain seemed 
fair on its face when executed, it has become unenforceable due to circumstances beyond the control 
of the Applicant or the State, namely the fact that one of the enhancement paragraphs was 
mischaracterized in the indictment, resulting in an illegal sentence far outside the statutory range of 
punishment." Id. at 515. Here, even if it could be argued that the NPA was "fair on its face," the fact 
is that it is now unenforceable due to the fact that the victims were never given their CVRA right to 
confer. Indeed, in Ex pane Rich, the court refused to enforce the plea agreement "due to circumstances 
beyond the control" of the defendant and the State. Id. Here, of course, the resulting "circumstances" 
EFTA00022605
--- PAGE 61 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 61 of 70 
(i.e., non-conferral with the victims) were entirely within the control Epstein and USAO-SDFL — and, 
in fact, were something that they conspired together to achieve. 
Epstein further argues that he should not be held accountable for what he describes as "[t]he 
government's failure to comply with its obligations to third parties." Epstein Remedies Br. at 45. 
The Court would be faced with a more difficult question if Epstein had actually understood that 
the Government was fully complying with its conferral obligations but had simply dropped the 
ball. The situation here is entirely different. It was both the Government and Epstein who worked 
together assiduously to hide the ball from the victims. Against that backdrop, no "inequities" (id.) 
would result from rescinding the NPA's immunity provisions. Epstein chose to arrange for an 
illegal deal — he is not entitled to reap the benefits of that illegality. 
Finally, Epstein also refers to his alleged "full performance" of his obligations under the 
NPA. Id. But that fact has recently been called into doubt by the ruling denying Epstein bail in 
the criminal case proceeding before the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. 
See Decision and Order Remanding Defendant, DE 32 at 19-20, U.S v. Epstein, No. 1:19-cr-490-
RMB (S.D.N.Y. July 18, 2019) (finding that "Mr. Epstein has not always been compliant with his 
legal obligations as a registered sex offender"). As the Court noted there, Epstein's counsel 
claimed that Epstein has been "scrupulously fulfill[ing] his obligations in every jurisdiction in 
which he was required to register [as a sex offender]" since his 2008 Florida convictions." Id. at 
19. But it appears that Epstein has not been compliant, for example, in New York. See id. at 20 
(noting that, notwithstanding a New York judge's order imposing a sex offender reporting 
requirement, according to an investigative report Epstein "has never reported as a sex offender to 
New York law enforcement"); see also id. at 21 (noting lack of information from Epstein's counsel 
EFTA00022606
--- PAGE 62 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 62 of 70 
demonstrating proper sex offender registration in New Mexico, Florida, and the Virgin Islands). 
These facts further undercut any claim by Epstein to being able to rely on the NPA. 
VI. 
SEPARATION OF POWERS DOES NOT PREVENT THE COURT FROM 
EXERCISING ITS STATUTORY POWER TO ENFORCE THE CVRA. 
Intervenor Epstein next argues that the rescission remedy would somehow interfere with 
separation of powers. Epstein Remedies Br. at 46-49. But Epstein lacks standing to assert 
interference with Executive prerogatives. The USAO-SDFL has been actively engaged in this 
litigation and has filed dozens of pleadings. Any issues regarding interference with the Executive 
branch have, no doubt, been properly advanced by that Office — and Epstein is simply an interloper 
who is not free to kibitz on constitutional issues regarding separation of powers. The federal courts 
are "not empowered to seek out and strike down any governmental act that they deem to be 
repugnant to the Constitution. Rather, federal courts sit `solely, to decide on the rights of 
individuals.'" Hein v. Freedom from Religion Found., Inc., 551 U.S. 587, 598 (2007) (Alito, J.) 
(citing Marbwy v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 170, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803)). Epstein does not have a 
"right" to separation of powers. 
Second, as discussed above in connection with the statutory authority of the U.S. 
Attorney's Offices, Congress is entitled to pass laws establishing rights for crime victims. To our 
knowledge, no litigant — and certainly not Epstein — has ever argued that the CVRA's extension of 
rights to victims unconstitutionally intrudes on executive power. Indeed, this Court has already 
explained why the CVRA does not interfere with prosecutorial discretion: "The Government 
correctly notes that the CVRA provides that InJothing in this chapter shall be construed to impair 
EFTA00022607
--- PAGE 63 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 63 of 70 
the prosecutorial discretion of the Attorney General or any officer under his direction.' 18 U.S.C.A. 
§ 3771(d)(6). The Court is not ruling that the decision not to prosecute was improper. The Court 
is simply ruling that, under the facts of this case, there was a violation of the victims' rights under 
the CVRA." 359 F.Supp.3d at 1222. The Court would say exactly the same thing in providing 
the victims a rescission remedy. The Court would not be ruling that the immunity provisions were 
"improper." The Court would simply say that, under the facts of this case, the provisions have to 
be rescinded because they were adopted in violation of the victims' CVRA rights. 
This Court's ruling to that effect would not "thrust the Court into the role of prosecutor and 
negotiator .. . ." Epstein Remedies Br. at 47. Instead, the Court would simply be performing the 
task that Congress assigned to it by directing that district courts "shall ensure" that victims receive 
their CVRA rights. 18 U.S.C. § 3771(b)(1). Once the immunity provisions have been rescinded, 
the victims would confer with the USAO-SDFL and then the prosecutors would be free to proceed 
as they saw fit. Ensuring that victims receive their procedural CVRA rights in no way intrudes 
on substantive decisions by prosecutors. 
To be sure, judicial authority is limited "when reviewing the Executive's exercise of 
discretion over charging determinations." United States v. Fokker Servs. B. V., 818 F.3d 733, 741 
(D.C. Cir. 2016). But Jane Doe 1 and 2 are not asking this Court to review any prosecutor's 
ultimate charging determination; all the victims seek is that they have their promised opportunity 
to "confer" with the prosecutors about what that determination should be. Thus, in enforcing the 
victims' rights, the Court would not be "rejecting the deal agreed to by the parties." Epstein 
Remedies' Br. at 49. It would simply be enforcing the victims' right to be involved in shaping that 
deal. As this Court has held, "the CVRA was designed to give the victims the same opportunity 
EFTA00022608
--- PAGE 64 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 64 of 70 
to attempt to affect prosecutorial decisions before they became final" as defendants have. 359 
F.Supp.3d at 1221. Enforcing that congressional decision is well within judicial authority. 
VII. 
THE VICTIMS' REQUEST FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF (REMEDY #2) 
IMMEDIATELY BECOMES RIPE UPON THE GRANTING OF A RESCISSION 
(REMEDY #1). 
Intervenor Epstein next argues that, even if the Court grants rescission (remedy #1), it 
would be premature for this Court to rule on whether the Constitution would permit his prosecution 
(remedy #2). Epstein Remedies Br. at 49. Epstein claims that such a ruling is precluded by the 
"ripeness" doctrine, which on closer examination turns out to involve a claim that no "case or 
controversy" would exist for such a determination. Id. at 50. 
If the Court grants rescission (remedy #1), the issue of declaratory relief (remedy #2) 
immediately becomes ripe. Specifically, unless this Court declares that it is permissible for the 
USAO-SDFL to prosecute Epstein, it will not be giving Epstein's victims "the same opportunity 
[as Epstein had] to attempt to affect prosecutorial decisions before they became final." 359 
F.Supp.3d at 1221. See generally Victims' Resp. to Government Remedies Submission at 35-37. 
Without such a declaration, the Jane Does would not be put back in the same position as they 
would have been had the Government complied with the CVRA. 
But, in any event, given the way that briefing has proceeded in this case, this request 
(remedy #2) is now largely subsumed by the way in which Epstein has advanced his arguments 
against rescission. If the Court reviews and rejects all of Epstein's arguments (as we believe it 
should), then the victims would largely receive the declaratory relief that they need. Epstein 
obviously believes that he is entitled to obtain a ruling on all of his constitutional arguments 
advanced here. And Epstein has presented a wide array of constitutional and separation of powers 
EFTA00022609
--- PAGE 65 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 65 of 70 
arguments against the rescission remedy. See, e.g., Epstein Remedies Br. at 14-27 (arguing that 
"procedural due process" precludes rescission); id. at 43-46 (arguing that "substantive due 
process" precludes rescission); id. at 46-49 (arguing that separation of powers precludes 
rescission). A Court ruling that, in spite of these constitutional arguments, rescission is nonetheless 
appropriate would appear to sweep away most of the constitutional bathers that the victims have 
been concerned about. 
Accordingly, for remedy #2, the victims simply ask the Court to reach — and reject — all of 
Epstein's constitutional claims. Following a court decision to that effect, the victims could then 
approach the Court if any constitutional issues remained at that time that were improperly 
impeding their ability to confer. 
VIII. THE COURT IS AUTHORIZED TO HOLD A PUBLIC HEARING WITH THE 
VICTIMS IN THIS CASE. 
Jane Doe 1 and 2 have requested that the Court hold a hearing in this case, at which time 
they could address the Court — and Epstein and prosecutors — about this case. DE 464 at 46-49. 
The Government responded by agreeing that a court hearing was appropriate but suggesting a 
slightly different format than the victims. DE 462 at 7. Jane Doe 1 and 2 have replied to the 
Government, continuing to agree with the Government that a hearing is appropriate but reaffirming 
their request (for example) that Epstein and former-U.S. Attorney Acosta attend the hearing. DE 
464 at 4649.22
Since the filing of that brief by the victims, Secretary Acosta has decided to resign his 
position as Labor Secretary. But during his press conference on July 10 on the topic of the NPA, 
Acosta stated that he might be willing, at some point, to "circle back" with the victims to discuss 
his handling of the case so as to be "more transparent." On July 15, counsel for Jane Doe 1 and 2 
sent a letter to Acosta, advising him of the hearing that the victims and his prior Office was 
EFTA00022610
--- PAGE 66 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 66 of 70 
Now Epstein has weighed in, claiming that the Court has "no authority" under the CVRA 
to preside over such a hearing. But, to the contrary, the CVRA provides enforcement powers to 
district courts to enforce the CVRA. 18 U.S.C. § 3771(b)(1). And contrary to Epstein's 
suggestion, there is clearly a "case or controversy" as to how to best provide the victims their 
CVRA rights. In the unusual circumstances that exist in this case, where even the Government 
concedes no remedy (rescission or otherwise) can fully put the victims back in the position that 
they would have been had the Government properly conferred in 2007, this Court clearly has power 
to act. As Senator Kyl explained, "it is the clear intent and expectation of Congress that the district 
. . . courts will establish procedures that will allow for a prompt adjudication of any issues 
regarding the assertion of a victim's right, while giving meaning to the rights we establish." 150 
Cong. Rec. 22953 (Oct. 9, 2004) (statement of Sen. Kyl) (emphases added). A hearing of the kind 
that the victims — and the Government —propose is an appropriate way to give at least some 
meaning to important CVRA rights. 
IX. 
ADOPTION OF EARLIER PLEADINGS BY REFERENCE 
Jane Doe 1 and 2 have also advanced numerous arguments in other filings that defeat 
Epstein's claims. To avoid duplicative briefing, Jane Doe I adopt by reference, in response to 
Epstein, all of the arguments they have advanced in DE 458 and DE 464. 
X. 
THE COURT SHOULD EXPEDITE ITS RULING ON REMEDIES AND ON THE 
VICTIMS' RIGHTS TO BE TREATED WITH FAIRNESS AND TO NOTICE. 
At this time, all of the briefing that the Court requested in its scheduling order (DE 454) 
has been completed. Accordingly, all the matters discussed in this submission are ripe for decision. 
proposing and asking whether he would voluntarily attend the hearing. Jane Doe I and 2 have yet 
to receive any response to the letter. 
EFTA00022611
--- PAGE 67 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 67 of 70 
Jane Doe 1 and 2 continue to request a rapid ruling on remedies by this Court.23 Any delay 
in ruling could further compound the damage that has already been done to Epstein's Florida 
victims by denying them an opportunity to meaningfully confer about federal charges being filed 
in this District — particularly given recent and on-going developments in New York that, while 
independent of this case, may make it more difficult for Jane Doe I and 2 to seek prosecution here. 
Jane Doe 1 and 2 also have pending before the Court two additional arguments as why the 
CVRA has been violated — specifically, that their rights to be treated with fairness and to notice 
have been violated. See DE 458 at 33. As previously explained, the Government has not 
challenged that the Court should hold that these two rights have been violated. DE 464 at 15. And, 
likewise, Epstein has not made any argument to the contrary. (He does not even cite the right to 
fairness in his brief.) Accordingly, the Court should summarily find that these rights have also 
been violated. After such a ruling, Jane Doe 1 and 2 would respectfully respect the opportunity to 
provide additional briefing on what additional remedies would then become available to them. 
Their existing briefing on remedies, of course, has been confined to explaining what remedies the 
Court should award based on its existing findings. The Court would have more expansive remedial 
powers based on more expansive findings of CVRA violations. 
To be clear, having previously discussed the issue with the Court and seen the Court's 
approach to resolving the pending issues, Jane Doe I and 2 are not seeking a jury trial on any 
aspect of this case. With regard to crafting remedies for the violation of their right to confer, the 
Court should exercise its remedial power. And with regard to the victims' still-pending claims that 
there has been a violation of their rights to be treated with fairness and to notice, the Court can 
make the necessary factual determinations to decide the matters. 
EFTA00022612
--- PAGE 68 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 68 of 70 
But none of these other possibilities should prevent the Court from moving forward rapidly 
with the issues that are fully briefed and squarely before it now. The victims request that the 
Court rule as rapidly as possible. 
XI. 
REQUEST FOR A HEARING (IF NECESSARY). 
If the Court requires any further factual predicate from Jane Doe 1 and 2 in response to 
Epstein's arguments, they request a hearing and opportunity to provide that predicate to the Court. 
CONCLUSION 
Intervenor Epstein set in motion a plan whereby he joined with the USAO-SDFL to reach 
a secret non-prosecution agreement — and then to have it put it in place without the victims having 
any opportunity to object. That plan to keep the victims in the dark was patently illegal under the 
CVRA. And the plan was in service of keeping a deal secret that could never have survived public 
or judicial scrutiny. 
This Court has now held that the Government's illegal actions, undertaken at Epstein's 
specific request, violated Jane Doe I and 2's rights under the Crime Victims' Rights Act. And the 
Court now possesses ample power to respond to this deliberate attempt to keep innocent victims 
uncertain about why multiple federal sex crimes against them were to go unpunished. The Court 
should accordingly grant Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2 all the remedies they have requested, 
including rescission of the NPA's "immunity" provisions precluding prosecution of Epstein and 
his co-conspirators for federal sex crimes committed in the Southern District of Florida.

need to do memos for the AG, but Geoff would like fairly meaty briefing memos on these matters. Some of them you 
have already done, so they can be supplemented/revised as appropriate — find one of us to discuss or answer any 
questions. We would like them from you by Wednesday if possible so that we can get them to Geoff by Thursday night or 
Friday. That sound okay?

the case. By 'we; I mean the FBI, CBP, the NYPD, and of course the U.S. Attorney's Office. We opened the case. We

2021.02.15 - NOTES Call with Jason Foy & Eric Sarraga re 
JL, NR, JF, ES 
• NR: checking in re June trial date 
• JF: would expect that court is going to adjourn this 
• JL: understanding is that some trials will start up beginning in February, but limited number 
• JF: suspect that this case will not take priority and will be adjourned; if the Court doesn't want to adjourn, will 
move forward in June 
• JF: may find out more information at the March conference 
• NR: had previously mentioned wanting to put in a DP application; has not been a standard DP/misdemeanor 
application process; if you are interested in making application, should make it sooner rather than later 
• JF: got sense that likelihood of them changing their minds was remote—is that still the case? 
• NR: pre-charge, you had mentioned misdemeanor (1018); have been some changes in leadership, there's a 
currently a pandemic, could supply additional information about what your client has been doing, collateral 
consequences of felony conviction, life plans, even in last year 
• JL: no predictions about the outcome, but here are some things to consider including: 
life plans, how she 
spent the past year, her familial responsibilities, etc.; less need to address litigation risk, because we are aware of 
those issues, but can include; in terms of selective prosecution argument, can make it, but in a more informational 
tone, rather than an accusatory tone 
• JF: not her formal position; goal was to put her in a position to cooperate and discuss disfunction at NYC BOP; no 
criminal intent on her part; now that reviewed discovery, do not believe that she should take a misdemeanor; 
believe that she was "not up to no good"; would recommend to her DP or trial; expect her to follow my lead, but 
she may compromise and accept misdemeanor; have found instances of similar conduct that haven't been 
prosecuted; understand that someone died, which makes it different; in case in Texas, COs weren't truthful to 
Inspector General; not the case here; no one tried to trick or do anything to frustrate anything; did not try to avoid 
what happened; said that they messed up in the moment; will not succeed if we (JL & NR) don't support it; have 
seen from discovery, that when it comes to Epstein, things are always different; did not really emphasize Epstein-
related argument at last conversation; she can be held accountable without having a criminal record—people don't 
usually get fired for this, so being fired would be a way of holding her accountable 
• JL: not previewing our position, but Nick and I have an open mind and will consider what you submit 
• JF: my duty to submit something; think it's a defensible case, but if I can get her the right result without all the 
drama, should do that; will do my best to stay away from fighting the case; emphasize fairness and change of 
circumstance; how long is process? 
• JL: explanation of DP process, including appeals 
• JF: same people who were at last meeting? 
• NR: some change in leadership 
• JL: not sure if the standard process will be followed or if brass will be involved earlier given that brass previously 
considered DP in this case 
• JF: this would be first formal DP application; prior meeting was about potential cooperation pre-charge 
• JL: may want to drop a FN that this is first formal application and a different posture than last time 
• JF: should discuss with Montell as well 
• JL: we have had a similar conversation with Montell 
• JF: Ds can be viewed as differently situated 
• JL: at least at this point, Ds will each be analyzed separately 
EFTA00022623
--- PAGE 2 ---
• JF: can see how DC interests diverge, given seniority and reality of who was doing and not doing what on day in 
question; include this? 
• JL: should include anything that mitigates her conduct

Below is an email I received from someone who has a radio broadcast in USVI. He's investigating (what he believes is) an 
ambulance which operated out of Epstein's compound. Just forwarding along, FWIW. Thanks. 
From:

(USANYS) < 
Subject: Re: SDNY raid on Little Saint James 
Mr. =, 
Thank you for the reply. On the Ambulance issue I confirmed through Ms. 
at USVI EMS the 
following. 
1. The vehicle has no registration of any kind. Required are Certificate of Need, ALS and BLS certification, 
Medical Director, Protocols, Staff providing care need to be USVI certified. These are huge violations of law. 
None of these requirements we even attempted to be obtained. 
2. To import a vehicle of this type, the above requirements need to be in compliance. No record if it's 
importation is on record with USVI EMS. This could mean 
A. Some corruption in customs allowed its importation. 
Or 
B. It was smuggled via shipping container. 
3. It holds a USVI license plate. Registering a vehicle of this type would be impossible, considering the above 
items. It was however able to obtain a tag from BMV. 
We confirmed through FDLE the vehicle was NOT listed on his Sex Offender Registration as his many other 
vehicles are. 
I will attach several screen shots of drone video we obtained from YouTube channel Rusty Shackleford . In the 
final picture the Ambulance appears to have been moved or removed from the property. 
This is Ms. 
email 
I gave her yours also. I believe they are doing an official investigation and would be glad to cooperate. I am 
available if I can be of any further help. 
Our viewers, and I think the public in general, are not happy with what happened with Epstein. As I'm sure 
SDNY is not. The questions we hear most, and are trying to answer with factual information are: 
EFTA00022633
--- PAGE 2 ---
1. Is this video an official raid? 
2. Why did it take so long? 
3. Has this, and all his properties been searched and seized? 
Answers to these questions would do much to restore the public's confidence in the investigation, as well as 
those victims yet to come forward. A statement from SDNY would be welcomed. 
Do you think a statement will be forthcoming? If so when? Thank you again for your time and attention. 
Godspeed with the Epstein case. 
PS: You might have already done this, but the Rusty Shackleford videos showed a lot of activity going on prior to 
the raid. Think this would be valuable if evidence was being removed or destroyed. 
Regards, 
J Taylor

Throughout my participation in this case, I have, as a practice, saved all Epstein-related emails that I received in my email

Dear all, 
As 
explained, we are instituting a formal litigation hold in connection with Mr. Epstein's death at MCC. You have 
been identified as having done work on or supervised the Epstein matter, and thus as possibly having responsive records. 
Please note and preserve whatever you have about Mr. Epstein, not limited to his death and to the earlier reported 
incident in which he suffered physical injuries. In addition, to the extent possible, please avoid altering any relevant 
records. If you need to use existing documents, please save what you're working off of as a new document so that the 
version that now exists remains preserved and available. 
EFTA00022636
--- PAGE 2 ---
I attach a formal litigation hold notice, which as required is on an EOUSA-provided form. Please review the notice, fill out 
the form to indicate whether and where you have responsive records, and sign and return it to me. In particular, be sure 
to let me know by USAO number if possible what records and share directories we have that are likely to include relevant 
information. 
I prefer scanned and emailed return of the forms, but you can also use interoffice mail if you prefer. 
Please let me know if you think other USAO personnel may have relevant documents or evidence. 
And please let me know if you have questions or want to discuss. 
Finally, I am copying 
to inform him of the new litigation hold, and to ask him to ensure that all responsive 
information on our electronic record systems is preserved, including by suspending the routine maintenance email 
deletions for recipients of this email.

Just spoke with 
It sounds like the SHU Lieutenant who wrote the first report about the incident only mentioned 
redness on Epstein's neck without mentioning any sort of object around the neck. Two other officers who responded to 
the cell apparently wrote supplemental reports saying that Epstein had something around his neck when they saw him. 
didn't have the reports in front of him when we spoke, so he couldn't be more specific. I've asked him to provide 
us with the reports as soon as possible.

Yes, if true, would be somewhat shocking that 
didn't report (and more shocking that they took him off suicide 
watch). Please let us know what you find out.

Subject: Attending the Upcoming Maxwell Trial 
Dear 
I represent 
one of the victims of Jeffrey Epstein and his lieutenant Ghislaine Maxwell. 
would like to attend the upcoming trial of Ms. Maxwell. She will be coming from England, 
where she lives. 
s not asking the government to pay for any travel expenses, but would like to be given priority 
(along with other victims of course) in getting into the trial as a spectator. Given the keen public interest in 
the case, she is afraid that without priority she will not be able to get into the courtroom. Would you let us 
know what your office is doing to ensure that victims like scan attend the trial? 
Thank you for all your hard work in bringing Ms. Maxwell to justice.

Sgt. 
On 12/06/01, OCVAN received intelligence from the WPBPD concerning Maxwell. 
According to the report, Maxwell is hiring young women from PBAC to come toher 
house and answer the phone. They are paid $200.00 per day for htis service. It 
is unclear what is occurring in the residence, however, contact information for 
PBAC students was provided. Follow-up will be initiated as soon as possible. 
10/13/03 
File 300-13 
Det. 
On 12/10/01, information was passed on from Sgt. 
regarding Ghislaine Maxwell 
and Jeffrey Epstein of 358 El Brillo Way. A West Palm Beach intelligence  report 
read as follows: "Three female  college students from PBAC ( 
were approached by an English woman who 
identified herself as Maxwell, on the Palm Beach Atlantic Campus. Maxwell said 
she needed young, beautiful unmarried women to answer phones and do office work at 
her home on Palm Beach. 
went to the house on several occasssions and 
described the telephone calls as men call in saying when they were going to drop 
of particular girls. All three girls said Maxwell and Epstein were secretive 
about what was going on at the house, and at least two of the girls complained 
about Epstein touching them inappropriately. They said Maxwell asked for a list 
of other girls who she could call to work on short notice. She said sho needed a 
large pool of girls to call as she did not know how many she would need at any 
given time. The callers were receptive to the idea of forwarding numbers of 
undercover personnel to Maxwell. Maxwell pays $200.00 per day for answering 
phones (cash). 
said she only worked there one day, but she hd been there 
on at least one other occasion. I did not speak with 
. Their telephone 
number is 
at their dorm room on campus (roommates). Maxwell and Epstein 
allegedly have a private plane and frequently go to New York leaving them out of 
the area for extended periods of time." 
Numerous attempts were made to reach the girls at the above listed number with 
negative results. Finally, I contacted PBA security who stated the college was 
closed for the semester and would not re open until next year. 
In the beginning of January, many messages were left which met with negative 
results.

On 1/28/02, trash pulls were initiated on this case, and conducted intermittently 
through 4/16/02. Numerous intelligence items were discovered within the trash, to 
include: individual directory listings for massages in New York, and the United 
Kingdom, numerous phone messages, daily calendars, list of female names titled 
"People that I want you to meet", listing females, ages, descriptions, and what 
they do (trash ull on 3/29/02) front page of bell south phone bill indicating 
phone account 
under the name of Jeffrey Epstein and account 
under the name of Ghislainne Maxwell, correspondence to 
indicate a weapon is kept on the property, financial information, nude photographs 
of women and numerous references to massages through daily calendars, phone 
messages, etc. It should be noted a list was complied of all names associated 
with Epstein/Maxwell/358 El Brillo Way, and is documented in the file. 
It should be noted that all attempts to reach reporting parties have met with 
negative results at this time. 
On 02/8/02, an investigative subpoena was completed requesting all incoming and 
outgoing lines to the address 358 El Brillo Way. 
On 02/13/02, the above referenced subpoena was received from the SAO and was 
served on Bell South via fax. 
On 02/12/02, an inquiry into corporations on line revealed Jeffrey E. Epstein 
related to three Florida entities: Financial Strategy Group, Inc; Ghislaine Corp; 
Financial Trustees, Inc. None of the aforementioned entities are active. 
On 02/22/02, I received information from Bell South which revealed the following 
telephone lines are installed at 358 El Brillo Way: 
Under name G. Maxwell

Hi, 
S o
I'm sorry I didn't answer sooner, but this went to my old email address & had to be routed to me. Aero Records was 
purchased in June by AIC Title Service LLC, and several of us are here at AIC now. My new information is below. (New 
email, address, phones, etc...) 
We can definitely take care of this for you. I will hold on to the name change copy that you emailed to us, and we need 
you to also send FM Form 8050-1, the Application for Aircraft Registration, for each of the aircraft, showing the new 
company name. We will submit the name change document, with the application forms, to the FAA, and they will issue 
new certificates to you, under the new name, about a month following the filing of the documents. Our fees are $79 
each aircraft, plus $5 to the FAA (total of $84 each aircraft). You can send us a check in the amount of $168., along with 
the documents, or give us a credit card to bill — whichever is easiest for you. 
If you have not received our information regarding the re-registration of all aircraft that will soon begin taking place at 
FAA, just let me know, and I will get that information to you, via email. Aircraft certificates will need to be renewed 
every three years, and our company has the ability to track these for clients. 
Just let me know if you need me to mail the Application for Registration forms to you, or answer any other questions. 
Thank you, 
Lisa

this Agreement in the form of Exhibit D hereof (a "Termination Notice").

(this "Second Amendment") is made and entered into as of the r day of May, 2021 (the 
"Effective Date"), by and between Hyperion Air, LLC ("Seller") and Industrial Integrity 
Solutions, LLC ("Purchase?), and amends that certain Aircraft Purchase Agreeement by and 
between Seller and Purchaser entered into as of April 16, 2021 (the "Original Agreement"), as 
the same was previously amended by that certain First Amendment to Aircraft Purchase 
Agreeement by and between Seller and Purchaser made and entered into as of April 20, 2021 
(said Original Agreement, as so amended, the "Agreement"), governing the purchase and the 
sale of that certain 2008 Keystone Helicopter (Sikorsky) model S-76C++ aircraft, bearing 
manufacturer's serial number 760750, and currently registered with the United States Federal 
Aviation Administration as N722JE. All capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined 
herein shall have the meanings ascribed to those terms in the Agreement. 
WHEREAS, Section 4(a) of the Agreement provides in relevant part that "...in no event 
shall the Closing take place later than May 7, 2021 (the "Closing Date")"; 
WHEREAS, the Parties desire to extend the May 7, 2021 Closing deadline provided for 
in Section 4(a) until May 13, 2021, so that May 13, 2021 is the absolute final and latest date 
by which Purchaser must close under the Agreement; and 
WHEREAS, Seller is willing to extend the May 7, 2021 Closing deadline until May 13, 
2021, effective when and on the condition that immediately upon execution of this Second 
Amendment Purchaser increases the Deposit by delivering to the Escrow Agent an additional 
One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000), and provided further that Purchaser agrees herein 
that the full amount of the Deposit, as so increased, is non-refundable and immediately, 
absolutely, and unconditionally due and payable to Seller regardless of whether or not the 
Closing occurs, and immediately instructs Escrow Agent to disburse the Deposit, as so 
increased, to Seller in accordance with Seller's disbursement instructions; 
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of these premises and the mutual covenants 
and agreements herein contained, the parties agree as follows: 
1. 
Subject to the provisions of Paragraph 2 of this Second Amendment and 
effective if and only if Purchaser fully complies with such provisions, Section 4(a) of the 
Agreement is hereby amended in its entirety to read as follows: 
(a) The closing of this transaction ("the Closing") and delivery of the 
Aircraft to Purchaser shall take place at Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport KFXE, 
Florida ("the Closing Place") by not later than the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined), 
EFTA00022786
--- PAGE 82 ---
unless the parties subsequently agree upon a later date in writing, in which case such 
agreed upon date shall be deemed the "Closing Date". The Closing shall take place 
promptly after: (i) Purchaser's delivery of the Certificate of Technical Acceptance 
indicating Purchaser's Unconditional Acceptance of the Aircraft in accordance with 
Sections 3(f) and (h) hereof; and (2) confirmation from the Escrow Agent that the 
Escrow Agent has received the Purchase Price Balance from Purchaser and all Escrow 
Documents (as defined below), but in no event shall the Closing take place later than 
May 13, 2021 (the "Closing Date"). Seller and Purchaser hereby acknowledge that the 
passing of title, possession and delivery of the Aircraft shall take place within the state 
in which the Closing Place is located. The fuel costs and the expenses of Seller's flight 
crew, if any, in flying the Aircraft from the Inspection Facility to the Closing Place 
shall be the sole responsibility of and paid for by Purchaser. 
2. 
Immediately following Purchaser's and Seller's execution of this Second 
Amendment, Purchaser shall increase the amount of the Deposit by delivering an additional 
One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) to the Escrow Agent, whereupon the full amount 
of the Deposit, as so increased (i.e., Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($200,000), hereinafter 
referred to as the "Increased Deposit"), shall be non-refundable and immediately, absolutely 
and unconditionally due and payable to Seller, regardless of whether or not a Closing shall 
thereafter occur. Concurrently with Purchaser's delivery of the additional amount of the 
Deposit to the Escrow Agent, Purchaser shall deliver to the Escrow Agent (and send a copy of 
the same to Seller) a signed written instruction directing the Escrow Agent to immediately 
disburse the Increased Deposit to Seller in accordance with Seller's disbursement directions, 
without any further writing or approval from Purchaser being required and without any 
requirement that a Closing occur. If and only if Seller receives the full amount of the Increased 
Deposit in accordance with Seller's disbursement instructions, the amount of the Purchase 
Price Balance required to be paid by Purchaser under the Agreement shall decrease to One 
Million Six Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,600,000). The provisions of Paragraph 1 of this 
Second Amendment will not be effective unless and until Seller receives the full amount of 
the Deposit in accordance with Seller's disbursement instructions. 
3. 
In the event of any inconsistencies between the provisions of the Agreement and 
the provisions of this Second Amendment, the provisions of this Second Amendment shall 
control in all respects. Except as expressly amended hereby, the provisions of the Agreement 
shall remain unchanged, valid and in full force and effect. 
4. 
This Second Amendment may be fully executed in separate counterparts by each 
of the parties hereto. Any signatures on this Second Amendment may be transmitted via 
facsimile or e-mail (in pdf format), which signatures shall be deemed originals for all purposes.

Hi Melissa 
Attached you will find the executed and counter executed APA between Hyperion Air LW and Industrial 
Integrity Solutions LLC for Sikorsky 576C++ sn 760750, N722JE. 
Additionally, I have attached the Exhibit C Technical acceptance making the deposit hereby non refundable. 
At your convenience, can you please return a copy of the APA with your executed Consent and Joinder? 
I expect you have already spoken with Rich Munkvold of Industrial Integrity Solutions with respect to lien 
searches, IR etc, but I will differ to him with respect to the timing of the dosing. 
I am fairly certain there are no plans to close this week. Let me know what he tells you in this respect.

1. 
Purchase Price: Payment. Seller agrees to sell, and Purchaser agrees to 
purchase, the Aircraft for a total purchase price of One Million Eight Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars 
(US $1,800,000) (the "Purchase Price"), which shall be paid by Purchaser to Seller as follows:

connection with this transaction (namely, the Deposit and the Purchase Price Balance). 
2. 
Condition of the Aircraft. 
(a) 
At the time of Seller's delivery to Purchaser of the Aircraft at the Closing, the 
Aircraft will be delivered to Purchaser: (a) with good and marketable title, free and clear of all liens 
and encumbrances, (b) with complete and continuous log books and maintenance records, (c) in an 
airworthy condition, subject, however, to the matters listed on Exhibit A-1, with a valid FAA standard

mandatory service bulletins that have been issued with respect to the Aircraft with due dates on or

assignment shall be borne solely by Purchaser, and (h) current, as of closing, on the manufacturer's 
recommended inspection and maintenance programs with all hourly, cycle and calendar inspections 
required under such program complied with without deferral. The Aircraft shall be deemed to be in 
"Delivery Condition" if it complies with the foregoing requirements. 
3. 
Pre-Purchase Inspection. 
(a) 
Purchaser, or its agent, shall have a right to perform a pre-purchase inspection 
of the Aircraft in accordance with this Section 3 (the "Pre-Purchase Inspection") at the Banyan FBO 
facility located at the Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport KFXE (the "Inspection Facility"). The 
Aircraft and its technical records have already been positioned at the Inspection Facility and are 
currently available for the Pre-Purchase Inspection as soon as Purchaser makes arrangements for the 
Pre-Purchase Inspection. 
(b) 
The Pre-Purchase Inspection will be performed on behalf of Purchaser and at 
Purchaser's sole cost and expense in order to determine whether or not the Aircraft conforms to the 
Delivery Condition as provided in Section 2 of this Agreement. 
(c) 
Purchaser shall cause the Pre-Purchase Inspection to be commenced at the 
Inspection Facility as soon as is reasonably practicable after the parties execute this Agreement, but 
in any event by no later than five (5) days after such execution 
(d) 
The scope and duration of the Pre-Purchase Inspection shall be as provided on 
Exhibit B hereto, incorporated by this reference as if fully provided herein.

during such flight test shall be those that are reasonably requested by the Purchaser and agreed to by 
Seller prior to the commencement of such flight test or, if arising out of a condition or circumstance

airworthy condition is referred to in this Agreement as a "Discrepancy". The Inspection Report shall 
note thereon each Discrepancy, if any, found during the Pre-Purchase Inspection (including, without 
limitation, during the test flight) and include written estimates of the costs to repair each Discrepancy

3(f), the Escrow Agent shall refund the Deposit to Purchaser, whereupon all further obligations of 
Seller and Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement shall cease, except those relating to expenses and 
confidentiality as provided in Sections 12(n) and (o) hereof. 
(h) 
If Purchaser issues a Certificate of Technical Acceptance indicating 
Purchaser's Unconditional Acceptance of the Aircraft, Purchaser shall wire transfer the Purchase 
Price Balance to Escrow Agent as provided in Section 1 hereof, and the parties shall proceed with 
Closing as hereinafter provided.

connection with this transaction (namely, the Deposit and the Purchase Price Balance). 
2. 
Condition of the Aircraft.

At the time of Seller's delivery to Purchaser of the Aircraft at the Closing, the 
Aircraft will be delivered to Purchaser: (a) with good and marketable title, free and clear of all liens 
and encumbrances, (b) with complete and continuous log books and maintenance records, (c) in an

assignment shall be borne solely by Purchaser, and (h) current, as of closing, on the manufacturer's 
recommended inspection and maintenance programs with all hourly, cycle and calendar inspections 
required under such program complied with without deferral. The Aircraft shall be deemed to be in 
"Delivery Condition" if it complies with the foregoing requirements. 
3. 
Pre-Purchase Inspection. 
(a) 
Purchaser, or its agent, shall have a right to perform a pre-purchase inspection 
of the Aircraft in accordance with this Section 3 (the "Pre-Purchase Inspection") at the Banyan FB0 
facility located at the Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport KFXE (the "Inspection Facility"). The 
Aircraft and its technical records have already been positioned at the Inspection Facility and are 
currently available for the Pre-Purchase Inspection as soon as Purchaser makes arrangements for the 
Pre-Purchase Inspection. 
(b) 
The Pre-Purchase Inspection will be performed on behalf of Purchaser and at 
Purchaser's sole cost and expense in order to determine whether or not the Aircraft conforms to the 
Delivery Condition as provided in Section 2 of this Agreement. 
(c) 
Purchaser shall cause the Pre-Purchase Inspection to be commenced at the 
Inspection Facility as soon as is reasonably practicable after the parties execute this Agreement, but 
in any event by no later than five (5) days after such execution 
(d) 
The scope and duration of the Pre-Purchase Inspection shall be as provided on 
Exhibit B hereto, incorporated by this reference as if fully provided herein.

during such flight test shall be those that are reasonably requested by the Purchaser and agreed to by 
Seller prior to the commencement of such flight test or, if arising out of a condition or circumstance 
occurring during said flight test, those that may be reasonably requested by the Purchaser and agreed

of the Delivery Condition requirements in Section 2 hereof that cause the Aircraft not to be in 
airworthy condition is referred to in this Agreement as a "Discrepancy". The Inspection Report shall 
note thereon each Discrepancy, if any, found during the Pre-Purchase Inspection (including, without 
limitation, during the test flight) and include written estimates of the costs to repair each Discrepancy 
so noted. At Purchaser's discretion, Purchaser shall accept the Aircraft in its "as-is", "where-is" and

Purchaser's Unconditional Acceptance of the Aircraft shall be evidenced by Purchaser's issuance to 
Seller, with a copy to the Escrow Agent, of a Certificate of Technical Acceptance in the form of

3(f), the Escrow Agent shall refund the Deposit to Purchaser, whereupon all further obligations of 
Seller and Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement shall cease, except those relating to expenses and 
confidentiality as provided in Sections 12(n) and (o) hereof. 
(h) 
If Purchaser issues a Certificate of Technical Acceptance indicating 
Purchaser's Unconditional Acceptance of the Aircraft, Purchaser shall wire transfer the Purchase 
Price Balance to Escrow Agent as provided in Section 1 hereof, and the parties shall proceed with 
Closing as hereinafter provided.

SECOND AMENDMENT TO AIRCRAFT PURCHASE AGREEMENT 
This SECOND AMENDMENT TO AIRCRAFT PURCHASE AGREEMENT 
(this "Second Amendment") is made and entered into as of the 71° day of May, 2021 (the 
"Effective Date"), by and between Hyperion Air, LLC ("Seller") and Industrial Integrity 
Solutions, LLC ("Purchase?), and amends that certain Aircraft Purchase Agreeement by and 
between Seller and Purchaser entered into as of April 16, 2021 (the "Original Agreement"), as 
the same was previously amended by that certain First Amendment to Aircraft Purchase 
Agreeement by and between Seller and Purchaser made and entered into as of April 20, 2021 
(said Original Agreement, as so amended, the "Agreement"), governing the purchase and the 
sale of that certain 2008 Keystone Helicopter (Sikorsky) model S-76C-++ aircraft, bearing 
manufacturer's serial number 760750, and currently registered with the United States Federal 
Aviation Administration as N722.IE. All capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined 
herein shall have the meanings ascribed to those terms in the Agreement. 
WHEREAS, Section 4(a) of the Agreement provides in relevant part that "...in no event 
shall the Closing take place later than May 7, 2021 (the "Closing Date")"; 
WHEREAS, the Parties desire to extend the May 7, 2021 Closing deadline provided for 
in Section 4(a) until May 13, 2021, so that May 13, 2021 is the absolute final and latest date 
by which Purchaser must close under the Agreement; and 
WHEREAS, Seller is willing to extend the May 7, 2021 Closing deadline until May 13, 
2021, effective when and on the condition that immediately upon execution of this Second 
Amendment Purchaser increases the Deposit by delivering to the Escrow Agent an additional 
One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000), and provided further that Purchaser agrees herein 
that the full amount of the Deposit, as so increased, is non-refundable and immediately, 
absolutely, and unconditionally due and payable to Seller regardless of whether or not the 
Closing occurs, and immediately instructs Escrow Agent to disburse the Deposit, as so 
increased, to Seller in accordance with Seller's disbursement instructions; 
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of these premises and the mutual covenants 
and agreements herein contained, the parties agree as follows: 
1. 
Subject to the provisions of Paragraph 2 of this Second Amendment and 
effective if and only if Purchaser fully complies with such provisions, Section 4(a) of the 
Agreement is hereby amended in its entirety to read as follows: 
(a) The closing of this transaction ("the Closing") and delivery of the 
Aircraft to Purchaser shall take place at Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport KFXE, 
Florida ("the Closing Place") by not later than the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined), 
EFTA00022952
--- PAGE 99 ---
unless the parties subsequently agree upon a later date in writing, in which case such 
agreed upon date shall be deemed the "Closing Date". The Closing shall take place 
promptly after: (i) Purchaser's delivery of the Certificate of Technical Acceptance 
indicating Purchaser's Unconditional Acceptance of the Aircraft in accordance with 
Sections 3(f) and (h) hereof; and (2) confirmation from the Escrow Agent that the 
Escrow Agent has received the Purchase Price Balance from Purchaser and all Escrow 
Documents (as defined below), but in no event shall the Closing take place later than 
May 13, 2021 (the "Closing Date"). Seller and Purchaser hereby acknowledge that the 
passing of title, possession and delivery of the Aircraft shall take place within the state 
in which the Closing Place is located. The fuel costs and the expenses of Seller's flight 
crew, if any, in flying the Aircraft from the Inspection Facility to the Closing Place 
shall be the sole responsibility of and paid for by Purchaser. 
2. 
Immediately following Purchaser's and Seller's execution of this Second 
Amendment, Purchaser shall increase the amount of the Deposit by delivering an additional 
One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) to the Escrow Agent, whereupon the full amount 
of the Deposit, as so increased i.e. Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($200,000), hereinafter 
referred to as the "Increased Deposit"), shall be non-refundable and immediately, absolutely 
and unconditionally due and payable to Seller, regardless of whether or not a Closing shall 
thereafter occur. Concurrently with Purchaser's delivery of the additional amount of the 
Deposit to the Escrow Agent, Purchaser shall deliver to the Escrow Agent (and send a copy of 
the same to Seller) a signed written instruction directing the Escrow Agent to immediately 
disburse the Increased Deposit to Seller in accordance with Seller's disbursement directions, 
without any further writing or approval from Purchaser being required and without any 
requirement that a Closing occur. If and only if Seller receives the full amount of the Increased 
Deposit in accordance with Seller's disbursement instructions, the amount of the Purchase 
Price Balance required to be paid by Purchaser under the Agreement shall decrease to One 
Million Six Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,600,000). The provisions of Paragraph I of this 
Second Amendment will not be effective unless and until Seller receives the full amount of 
the Deposit in accordance with Seller's disbursement instructions. 
3. 
In the event of any inconsistencies between the provisions of the Agreement and 
the provisions of this Second Amendment, the provisions of this Second Amendment shall 
control in all respects. Except as expressly amended hereby, the provisions of the Agreement 
shall remain unchanged, valid and in full force and effect 
4. 
This Second Amendment may be fully executed in separate counterparts by each 
of the parties hereto. Any signatures on this Second Amendment may be transmitted via 
facsimile or e-mail (in pdf format), which signatures shall be deemed originals for all purposes.

between Seller and Purchaser entered into as of April 16, 2021 (the "Original Agreement"), as 
the same was previously amended by that certain First Amendment to Aircraft Purchase 
Agreeement by and between Seller and Purchaser made and entered into as of April 20, 2021 
(said Original Agreement, as so amended, the "Agreement"), governing the purchase and the 
sale of that certain 2008 Keystone Helicopter (Sikorsky) model S-76C++ aircraft, bearing 
manufacturer's serial number 760750, and currently registered with the United States Federal 
Aviation Administration as N722JE. All capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined 
herein shall have the meanings ascribed to those terms in the Agreement. 
WHEREAS, Section 4(a) of the Agreement provides in relevant part that ". . .in no event 
shall the Closing take place later than May 7, 2021 (the "Closing Date")"; 
WHEREAS, the Parties desire to extend the May 7, 2021 Closing deadline provided for 
in Section 4(a) until May 13, 2021, so that May 13, 2021 is the absolute final and latest date 
by which Purchaser must close under the Agreement; and 
WHEREAS, Seller is willing to extend the May 7, 2021 Closing deadline until May 13, 
2021, effective when and on the condition that immediately upon execution of this Second 
Amendment Purchaser increases the Deposit by delivering to the Escrow Agent an additional 
One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000), and provided further that Purchaser agrees herein 
that the full amount of the Deposit, as so increased, is non-refundable and immediately, 
absolutely, and unconditionally due and payable to Seller regardless of whether or not the 
Closing occurs, and immediately instructs Escrow Agent to disburse the Deposit, as so 
increased, to Seller in accordance with Seller's disbursement instructions; 
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of these premises and the mutual covenants 
and agreements herein contained, the parties agree as follows: 
1. 
Subject to the provisions of Paragraph 2 of this Second Amendment and 
effective if and only if Purchaser fully complies with such provisions, Section 4(a) of the 
Agreement is hereby amended in its entirety to read as follows: 
(a) The closing of this transaction ("the Closing") and delivery of the 
Aircraft to Purchaser shall take place at Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport KFXE, 
Florida ("the Closing Place") by not later than the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined), 
EFTA00022955
--- PAGE 102 ---
unless the parties subsequently agree upon a later date in writing, in which case such 
agreed upon date shall be deemed the "Closing Date". The Closing shall take place 
promptly after: (i) Purchaser's delivery of the Certificate of Technical Acceptance 
indicating Purchaser's Unconditional Acceptance of the Aircraft in accordance with 
Sections 3(f) and (h) hereof; and (2) confirmation from the Escrow Agent that the 
Escrow Agent has received the Purchase Price Balance from Purchaser and all Escrow 
Documents (as defined below), but in no event shall the Closing take place later than 
May 13, 2021 (the "Closing Date"). Seller and Purchaser hereby acknowledge that the 
passing of title, possession and delivery of the Aircraft shall take place within the state 
in which the Closing Place is located. The fuel costs and the expenses of Seller's flight 
crew, if any, in flying the Aircraft from the Inspection Facility to the Closing Place 
shall be the sole responsibility of and paid for by Purchaser. 
2. 
Immediately following Purchaser's and Seller's execution of this Second 
Amendment, Purchaser shall increase the amount of the Deposit by delivering an additional 
One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) to the Escrow Agent, whereupon the full amount 
of the Deposit, as so increased (i.e., Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($200,000), hereinafter 
referred to as the "Increased Deposit"), shall be non-refundable and immediately, absolutely 
and unconditionally due and payable to Seller, regardless of whether or not a Closing shall 
thereafter occur. Concurrently with Purchaser's delivery of the additional amount of the 
Deposit to the Escrow Agent, Purchaser shall deliver to the Escrow Agent (and send a copy of 
the same to Seller) a signed written instruction directing the Escrow Agent to immediately 
disburse the Increased Deposit to Seller in accordance with Seller's disbursement directions, 
without any further writing or approval from Purchaser being required and without any 
requirement that a Closing occur. Wand only if Seller receives the full amount of the Increased 
Deposit in accordance with Seller's disbursement instructions, the amount of the Purchase 
Price Balance required to be paid by Purchaser under the Agreement shall decrease to One 
Million Six Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,600,000). The provisions of Paragraph 1 of this 
Second Amendment will not be effective unless and until Seller receives the full amount of 
the Deposit in accordance with Seller's disbursement instructions. 
L-a-,v-oceste.. 
3. 
In the event of any inconsistencies between the provisions of the Agreement and 
the provisions of this Second Amendment, the provisions of this Second Amendment shall 
control in all respects. Except as expressly amended hereby, the provisions of the Agreement 
shall remain unchanged, valid and in full force and effect. 
4. 
This Second Amendment may be fully executed in separate counterparts by each 
of the parties hereto. Any signatures on this Second Amendment may be transmitted via 
facsimile or e-mail (in pdf format), which signatures shall be deemed originals for all purposes.

Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell, through her counsel and pursuant to this Court's Order 
and Protocol for Unsealing Decided Motions, DE 1044, as clarified by DE 1053, objects to the 
unsealing of the Sealed Items contained in: 
• 
DE 143 (and related DEs 142, 144, 144-1, 149, 150, 150-1, 151, 152, 153, and 153-
1); 
• 
DE 172 (and related DEs 171, 173, 173-1, 189, 190, 190-1, 202, 203, 204-1, 211, 
212, 212-1, and 224) and; 
• 
DE 199 (and related DEs 200, 200-1, 228,2 29, 229-1, 284, 249, and 249-1). 
The reasons for her objections are stated in her accompanying memorandum of law. 
Ms. Maxwell, does not object to the potential unsealing of the Sealed Items contained in 
DEs 164 and related DEs 165, 165-8, 185-3, 185-11, 185-14, 185-15 or DE 230 and related DEs 
235, 235-5, 235-7, 235-11, 235-13 at a future date. However, unsealing of these Sealed Items 
would be premature at this time because multiple Non-Party Does are referenced in these items, 
as described in the accompanying memorandum of law, and should be provided Notice and an 
opportunity to object pursuant to the Protocol.

Pursuant to this Court's Order and protocol for Unsealing Decided Motions, Defendant 
Ghislaine Maxwell, through her counsel objects to the unsealing of documents for the reasons 
stated. 
I. Overview 
Docket Entries ("DEN") 143, 164, 172, 199, and 230 ("Sealed Material[s]" or "Sealed 
Item[s]") have been selected by the Court, with respect to Does 1 and 2, to begin the process of 
individualized review of these selected Sealed Materials to determine (a) the weight of 
presumption of public access that should be afforded to an item, (b) the identification and weight 
of any countervailing interests supporting continued sealing/redaction of the item, and (c) whether 
the countervailing interests rebut the presumption of public access to the item. Giuffre v. Maxwell, 
No. 15-CV-07433-LAP, 2020 WL 1547377, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 2020); DE 1044.' Based on 
the Court's clarification of its March 31, 2020 Order, DE 1053, ("the Protocol"), Non-Parties 
Does I and 2 have been served with the approved Notice and, pursuant to the Protocol, additional 
Non-Parties will be notified prior to any unsealing of the selected Sealed Materials. 
Does 1 and 2 did not respond to the Notice. The absence of a response, however, does not 
end the analysis. Although the Court's Protocol requires consideration of objections from the 
other Non-Parties yet to be noticed, the Court could (and should) determine, based on the 
circumstances of the Sealed Materials selected here, that the items are appropriately sealed 
without the need for additional Non-Party objections. 
' Pursuant to paragraph 2.g of the Order "any memorandum in support of a ... Party 
Objection to unsealing a particular Sealed Item shall be no longer than 6 double-spaced pages in 
point, Times New Roman Font. Ms. Maxwell has lodged objections to the identified 
documents in 14 pages in compliance with the Order, i.e., this pledge is one-half of the authorized 
length.

Applying the three-part analysis set forth by the Court in its March 31, 2020 Order to the 
selected Sealed Materials in Des 143, 172, and 1992 results in a determination that: (a) the 
selected Sealed Materials relate solely to five-year-old discovery disputes and therefore, at most, 
begin with a presumption of public access "somewhat lower than the presumption applied to 
material introduced at trial, or in connection with dispositive motions such as motions for 
dismissal or summary judgment." Brown v. Maxwell, 929 F.3d 41, 50 (2d Cir. 2019) (citing 
United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1049-50 (2d Cir. 1995) ("Amodeo II")); (b) any minimum 
presumption of public access is subject to many countervailing interests supporting continued 
sealing; and (c) the countervailing interests rebut any minimal presumption of public access. 
IL DE 143 and Related DEs 142, 144, 144-1-7, 149, 150, 150-1, 151, 152, 153, and 153-1 
are afforded the lowest presumption of public access and these Sealed Materials 
should remain sealed. 
This series of pleadings concerns Plaintiff's attempt to compel Ms. Maxwell to answer 
intrusive questions about her sex life.' DE 143 quotes extensively, selectively, and misleadingly 
from Ms. Maxwell's first seven-hour deposition. DE 144-1-7 contains 7 exhibits: 1, 2, and 4-7 are 
As discussed in Sections VII at VIII, infra, consideration of DEs 164 and 230 is 
premature at this time. 
'DE 142 is a letter notice; DE 143 is the initial motion; DE 144 is a lawyer 
declaration referencing the exhibits in DE 144-1-7. The declarations accompanying the 
various Sealed Materials often identify a Non-Party. The Court may wish to simply redact 
all of the Non-Party names from the declarations as a means of streamlining review and 
Notice problems. DE 149 is Defendant's Response, 150 is a lawyer declaration 
referencing the exhibit in DE 150-1. DE 151 is another letter notice. DE 152 is Plaintiff's 
Reply. DE 153 is another lawyer declaration referencing the exhibits in DE 153-1-7. The 
name of Doe 1 appears in DEs 152, p. 6 and 153 p. 2 11 7 and 8. Doe 2 does not appear in 
any DE 143 related pleading. 
The following DEs contain references to Non-Parties: DE 143 references 2 non-parties; 
DE 144-1-7 references 7 non-parties; DE 150-1 references 9 non-parties.

excerpts from Ms. Maxwell's deposition. Exhibit 3 contains pages from the Palm Beach Police 
Report. DE 149 is Ms. Maxwell's response to DE 143. 
Page 2 of DE 149 contains a summary of Ms. Maxwell's deposition testimony. DE 150-1 
contains pages of Ms. Maxwell's deposition necessary to place Plaintiff's submission into 
context. DE 153 is Plaintiff's reply which, again quotes from Ms. Maxwell's deposition and 
references numerous Non-Parties. DE 153-1 contains 7 exhibits. Exhibit I is a portion of Ms. 
Maxwell's deposition. Exhibit 2 contains a "Flight Log Summary Chart" prepared by Plaintiff's 
counsel and flight logs that contain the names of numerous Non-Party Does. Exhibit 3 purports to 
be 88 pages of Palm Beach Police Reports, some redacted, some unredacted, with multiple 
references to Non-Party Does. Exhibit 4 and 7 are inadmissible hearsay transcripts from an 
unreliable deceased individual never deposed by Ms. Maxwell. Exhibits 5 and 6 concern J. Doe I. 
III. DE 143, DE 144-1, exhibits 1, 2, and 4-7; DE 149, page 2, summary of Ms. Maxwell's 
deposition testimony; DE 150-1; DE 153; and DE 153-1: Identification of 
Countervailing Interests. 
A. Countervailing Interests. 
All of the above DEs are either quotes from, summaries of, or portions of transcripts from 
Ms. Maxwell's deposition in this case. The subject matter of these DEs is extremely personal, 
confidential, and subject to considerable abuse by the media. Countervailing interests include: 
1. Reasonable reliance on a protective order by a party or non-party ("CI-1"). 
If a party or nonparty provides information in connection with a lawsuit in reasonable reliance 
upon a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(c) protective order, the information must remain 
sealed. See Martindell v. Intl TeL & TeL Corp., 594 F.2d 291, 296 (2d Cir. 1979); see id. at 297-
(Medina, J., concurring) (noting "overriding policy in favor of enforcing the civil protective 
order against federal prosecutor's request for deposition transcripts", and holding "[A] plaintiff in 
a civil litigation is bound by the terms of an agreement he has made to restrict the access of non-
EFTA00022966

parties, including the Government, to the products of discovery. This was the essence of Judge 
Frankel's decision in GAF Corp. v. Eastman Kodak Co., 415 F.Supp. 129 (S.D.N.Y.1976), with 
which I fully concur.") (footnote omitted). Martindeli was cited with approval in SEC v. 
TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d 222, 232 (2d Cir. 2001), which was cited with approval in Brown, 929 
F.3d at 51 n.40. Notably the Second Circuit in Brown held that redactions of sensitive, private 
information disclosed by witnesses in depositions because of "a strong expectation of continued 
confidentiality, " Brown, 929 F.3d at 48 n.22, and the Second Circuit itself redacted sensitive 
personal references in Ms. Maxwell's deposition testimony excerpts. 
Ms. Maxwell was the Defendant in this defamation action. She did not inject her personal 
life into this case and was deposed under a court-ordered guarantee that her testimony would 
remain confidential. She relied on that order and has a strong expectation of continued 
confidentiality. 
2. Prevention of the abuse of court records and flies ("CI-2"). 
Courts must exercise their supervisory power over their own records and files to ensure 
they "are not used to gratify private spite or promote public scandal" or "serve as reservoirs of 
libelous statements for press consumption." Brown, 929 F.3d at 51 (quoting Nixon v. Warner 
Commens, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 598 (1978)). The Brown court held: "District courts should 
exercise the full range of their substantial powers to ensure their files do not become vehicles for 
defamation. Id. at 53. The above DE's are textbook examples of materials that should not be 
submitted to courts because of their potential for abuse. 
3. Annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, undue burden ("CI-3"). 
Materials that cause annoyance, embarrassment, oppression or undue burden to an 
individual should be sealed or redacted. See Brown, 929 F.3d at 51. The questions were intrusive 
and embarrassing. 
EFTA00022967

casQair.q.§&61'43g49411enbegnieAFiliW4clieVdt§h.V2ea 
'ea ef62(9f 17 
4. Preserving the fundamental rights of suspects or others under criminal 
investigation ("CI-4"). 
The preservation of the fundamental rights of suspects and others under criminal 
investigation is a powerful countervailing interest weighing against the presumption of access. 
See Nixon, 435 U.S. at 595, 602; Brown, 929 F.3d at 47 n.13; Martindell, 594 F.2d at 295-97. The 
courts have an obligation to safeguard the integrity of criminal investigations and the privacy and 
safety of witnesses and suspects that are part of those investigations. United States v. Longueuil, 
567 F. App'x 13, 16 (2d Cir. 2014) (holding that district court properly sealed contested 
documents "as they reflected sensitive information about cooperating witnesses, "and concluding 
that sealing was justified in part "to safeguard the privacy of individuals involved in an 
investigation"; "[t]tle district court was in the best position to weigh these factors") (internal 
quotations and citation omitted); Hardy, 697 Fed. App'x at 725 (2d Cir. 2017) (noting that courts 
have found that the following can defeat presumption of access: protection of ongoing 
investigations, safety of witnesses, national security, and trade secrets). 
Ms. Maxwell is aware, based on publicly reported statements by Plaintiff, Plaintiff's 
counsel, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and the Attorney 
General for the U.S. Virgin Islands, that investigations surrounding the alleged conduct of Mr. 
Epstein survive his death. It is unclear who are witnesses or targets of any investigation. These 
ongoing investigations are a powerful countervailing interest here. The sealed testimony or 
summaries may inappropriately influence potential witnesses or alleged victims. 
IV. DE 144-1- Exhibit 3 (police reports); DE 153; DE 153- Exhibit 2 "Flight Log 
Summary Chart" prepared by Plaintiff's counsel and flight logs; Exhibit 3 (88 pages 
of police reports): Identification of Countervailing Interests. 
Numerous yet to be notified Non-Party Does are mentioned in these documents and it is 
premature for the Court to make any decision to unseal these documents prior to Notice. 
EFTA00022968

However, these materials are subject to the following countervailing interests regardless of 
additional Non-Party objections: 
A. Countervailing Interests 
1. Prevention of the abuse of court records and files (CI-2). 
Brown, 929 F.3d at 51and 53, see section III.A.2, supra. 
2. Improper submission of documents ("CI-5"). 
Documents that a party has submitted for a non-merits purpose, e.g., the confidentiality, 
discoverability or admissibility of information, should remain sealed or redacted if there is any 
interest in sealing or redaction. See TheSreet.Com, 273 F.3d at 233. The references to the various 
attached exhibits were gratuitous and served no legitimate purpose related to the discovery 
dispute. During the course of this litigation Plaintiff offered, on more than one occasion, various 
iterations and compilations of the Palm Beach Police Reports in which no one identified Ms. 
Maxwell as a suspect, a perpetrator, or participant. The attachment of alleged summaries of flight 
logs, alleged flight logs, and police reports was simply a mechanism to attempt to bias the Court 
and any potential future reader of the material. These issues were briefed in various undecided 
motions in limine. 
3. Untrustworthy, unreliable, and incorrect information ("CI-6"). 
Courts should continue the sealing or redaction of information that is or may be

Maxwell. The exhibits could not be considered evidence and should not have been submitted to 
the Court. The declarant suffered multiple felony convictions and had been involved in attempting 
to obtain money from one of Plaintiff's lawyers in exchange for alleged evidence. These issues 
were briefed in various undecided motions in limine. 
V. DE 153-1 exhibits 4 and 7 and DE 153-1, exhibits 5 and 6: Identification of 
Countervailing Interests 
A. Countervailing Interests 
1. Untrustworthy, unreliable, and incorrect information (CI-6). 
Exhibits 5 and 6 concern J. Doe I. Both exhibits are hearsay statements made by J. Doe 1 
in proceedings that did not involve Ms. Maxwell. J. Doe 1 was not examined by Ms. Maxwell's 
counsel in that proceeding making the statements unreliable and inadmissible. 
VI. DE 172 (and related DEs 171, 173, 173-1, 189, 190, 190-1, 202, 203, 204-1, 211, 212, 
212-1, and 224) are afforded the lowest presumption of public access and this Sealed 
Material should remain sealed. 
These pleadings concern what should have been a straightforward request by Plaintiff to 
exceed the presumptive 10 deposition limit set by the Court? It was not. Instead of simply asking 
to exceed the presumptive limit, Plaintiff felt the urge to pack the record with deposition 
testimony subject to the Protective Order and references to multiple Non-Party Does including 
deposition testimony from Non-Party Does!' 
DE 171 is a letter notice; DE 172 is the initial motion; DE 173 is a lawyer declaration 
referencing the exhibits in DE 173-1. DE 189 is Defendant's Response, 190 is a lawyer 
declaration referencing the exhibit in DE 190-1. DE 202 is another letter notice. DE 203 is 
Plaintiff's Reply. DE 204 is another lawyer declaration referencing the exhibits in DE 204-1. 
DEs 211, 212, 212, 212-1 and 224 are amended/corrected versions of DEs 202, 203, and 204-1. 
The name of Doe 1 appears in DEs 172, pp. i, 2, 6, 11, and 12; 173 p. 2 if 5 and 10; 173-6 pp. 71, 
73, and 218; 189 p. 6; 203, pp. 2, and 5-6, 204, p. 115 ; 204-3, all; 211, see 203; 212, see 204; 
212-3, see 204-1:3; 224, see 203. Doe 2 appears in DEs 172, pp. i, 2, and 12; and 189 p.5. 
The following DEs contain references to Non-Parties: DE 172 references 14 non-parties; 
DE 173-1 references 47 non-parties; DE 189 references 8 non-parties; DE 203 references 12 non-

Given the repeated references to Non-Parties it is premature for the Court to make any 
decision to unseal these documents prior to Notice. However, Countervailing interests exist that 
warrant a decision to seal many of the Selected Materials regardless of any additional Non-Party 
objections. 
A. Identification of Countervailing Interests 
1. Reasonable reliance on a protective order by a party or non-party (CI-1). 
Prevention of the abuse of court records and files (CI-2). Annoyance, 
embarrassment, oppression, undue burden (CI-3). Preserving the 
fundamental rights of suspects or others under criminal investigation (CI-4). 
DE 172 contains multiple references to Ms. Maxwell's deposition testimony and the 
deposition testimony of one other Non-Party taken pursuant to the Protective Order. See pp. 2, 4-8 
as to Ms. Maxwell and pp. 3, 4, 9, and 11 as to an additional Non-Party Doe. Reasonable reliance 
on a protective order by a party or non-party, Prevention of the abuse of court records and files, 
Annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, undue burden, Preserving the fundamental rights of 
suspects or others under criminal investigation, all identified in section III.A.1-4 apply to these 
pages of DE 172. 
2. Non-Judicial Documents ("CI-7"). 
In defining "judicial records and documents," the Second Circuit "ha[s] emphasized that 
`the mere filing of a paper or document with the court is insufficient to render that paper a judicial 
document subject to the right of public access."' Brown v. Maxwell, 929 F.3d 41, 49 (2d Cir. 
2019) (emphasis supplied; footnote omitted; quoting United States v. Amodeo, 44 F.3d 141, 145 
(2d Cir. 1995) ("Amodeo r')). Amodeo I, the inception of the Second Circuit's principle that a file 
stamp is not a judicial-document talisman, is instructive. There an appointed Court Officer tasked 
parties; DE 204-1 references 4 non-parties; DE 211 references 12 non-parties; DE 202 references 
non-parties; DE 202-1 references 2 non-parties; DE 224 references 8 non-parties.

with an investigation for the District Court for the Southern District of New York prepared and 
filed with the court a sealed report of her investigation. Newsday moved to unseal the report. 
After the court released an edited and redacted copy of the report, Newsday appealed. See 44 F.3d 
at 142-43. 
If its mere filing transformed the report into a judicial document, Amodeo I would have 
been categorical and succinct. It was neither. The decision turned on the Second Circuit's lengthy 
discussion of the First and Third Circuits' divergent approaches to the question, when is a mere 
document transformed into a judicial one? The Third Circuit's focus was "`on the technical 
question of whether a document is physically on file with the court."' Amodeo I, 44 F.3d at 145 
(quoting Pansy v. Borough of Stroudsburg, 23 F.3d 772, 782 (3d Cir. 1994)). In that circuit if a 
document is filed with a court, it is a judicial document; otherwise it is not. See id. (citing Pansy, 
F.3d at 782). The Amodeo I court cited two other Third Circuit cases confirming that circuit's 
litmus-test approach to identifying judicial documents: Bank of America National Trust and 
Savings Association v. Hotel Rittenhouse Association, 800 F.2d 339, 344-45 (3d Cir. 1986) 
("Once a settlement is filed in the district court, it becomes a judicial record, and subject to the 
access accorded such records."); Leucadia, Inc. v. Applied Extrusion Technologies, Inc., 998 F.2d 
157, 161-62 (3d Cir. 1993) (listing cases in which "other courts have also recognized the principle 
that the filing of a document gives rise to a presumptive right of public access"). Amodeo 1, 44 
F.3d at 145. 
The First Circuit "has taken a somewhat different approach," id. In that circuit "documents 
must have a role in the adjudication process in order to be accessible and . . . documents that have 
no such role, such as those used in discovery, cannot be reached." Id. (citing Anderson v. 
Cryovac, Inc., 805 F.2d 1, 13 (1st Cir. 1986)). Amodeo I found instructive F.T.C. v. Standard 
EFTA00022972
--- PAGE 14 ---
casanq-16?et43PstAtmenbeCirheAFRV03elielffiehb,28arabcli2131 17 
Financial Management Corp., 830 F.2d 404 (1st Cir. 1987). In F.T.C. a district court relied upon 
financial records referenced in a proposed consent decree in deciding whether to approve the 
decree. The First Circuit held the financial records were judicial documents because they were 
submitted to the court as part of the decree-approval process, they were "'relevant and material" 
to the process, and the district court "relied upon the documents in assessing the reasonableness of 
the order, i.e., in determining the litigants' substantive rights, and in performing its adjudicatory 
function." Id. (quoting F.T.C., 830 F.2d at 410). 
The Second Circuit adopted the First Circuit's approach: 
We think that the mere filing of a paper or document with the court is insufficient 
to render that paper a judicial document subject to the right of public access. We 
think that the item filed must be relevant to the performance of the judicial 
function and useful in the judicial process in order for it to be designated a judicial 
document. 
Id. Brown was building on Amodeo /'s holding when it said, "As our precedent makes clear, a 
court "`perform[s] the judicial function' ... when it rules on motions currently before it." Brown, 
929 F.3d at 49 (emphasis supplied; footnote omitted; quoting Arnodeo I, 44 F.3d at 145). And it 
was building on Amodeo I when it said, "A document is thus `relevant to the performance of the 
judicial function' if it would reasonably have the tendency to influence a district court's ruling on 
a motion ...." Id. (emphasis supplied; footnote omitted; quoting Amodeo I, 44 F.3d at 145). Both 
Brown accretions to the Amodeo I principle are themselves dependent upon the principle. If a 
motion is not "currently before" the district court, then a fortiori the court is not "perform[ing] the 
judicial function." And if a motion is not currently before the court, then a fortiori it cannot 
"reasonably have [a] tendency to influence" the court. 
Brown's holding was hardly a surprise. It followed S.E.C. v. TheStreet.Com, 273 F.3d 222, 
233 (2d Cir. 2001). There the Second Circuit held that documents that "did not `directly affect an 
EFTA00022973

adjudication' nor ... significantly `determine litigants' substantive rights' were not judicial 
documents. (Brackets omitted; quoting United States v. Amodeo,71 F.3d 1044, 1049 (2d Cir. 
1995) ("Amodeo II").) 
DE 173, a declaration, references additional Non-Parties, generally those identified in 
lawyer emails. The Court may wish to defer consideration of this DE. Redaction of the names 
would eliminate any issue related to this document. DE 173-1 exhibits 1-4 identify additional 
Non-Parties. Generally, these exhibits are a composite of various back and forth emails between 
counsel which are hearsay, non-judicial, documents and which contain the identity of Non-Party 
Does. This exhibit should not be considered a judicial document. The arguments of counsel in 
self-serving emails are generally not reliable evidence upon which any judicial decision rests or 
should rest. 
3. Reasonable reliance on a protective order by a party or non-party (CI-1). 
Prevention of the abuse of court records and files (CI-2). Annoyance, 
embarrassment, oppression, undue burden (CI-3). Preserving the 
fundamental rights of suspects or others under criminal investigation (CM). 
Untrustworthy, unreliable, and incorrect information (CI-6). 
DE 172-1, exhibit 5, is an entire, 160-page, Non-Party deposition taken under the 
guarantee of the Protective Order entered in this case and should be sealed by application of the 
countervailing interests identified in [] above. Similarly DE 172-1, exhibit 6 is the entire, 418-
page, deposition of Ms. Maxwell taken under the guarantee of the Protective Order and should 
remain sealed based on the countervailing interests identified above. 
DE 172-1, exhibit 7, is yet another copy of the same 88 pages of police reports attached to 
many other pleadings in this case. This exhibit should remain sealed for the reasons discussed in 
section VI.A.2 and 3, supra. 
DE 172-1, exhibit 8, is an identical copy of J. Doe l's hearsay statement attached to DE 
153-1 and should be sealed for the same reasons discussed in section V.A.1.

4. Non-Judicial Documents (CI-7) 
DE 172-1, exhibit 9, is additional counsel generated, self-serving correspondence that is 
not a judicial document as discussed in section VI.A.2 above. 
5. Reasonable reliance on a protective order by a party or non-party (CI-1). 
Prevention of the abuse of court records and files (CI-2). Annoyance, 
embarrassment, oppression, undue burden (CI-3). Preserving the 
fundamental rights of suspects or others under criminal investigation (CI-4). 
DE 189 is Defendant's response to the motion. Page 5 of the response contains a 
paragraph quoting the deposition testimony of a Non-Party taken pursuant to the Protective Order 
which should remain sealed because of countervailing factors CI-1 through CI-4. The remaining 
portions of that document can be unsealed, subject to any additional Non-Party objections. 
DE 190 and 190-1 relate to deposition testimony by Plaintiff. Ms. Maxwell has no 
objection to unsealing these documents, subject to any Non-Party objections. 
6. Reasonable reliance on a protective order by a party or non-party (CI-1). 
Prevention of the abuse of court records and files (CI-2). Annoyance, 
embarrassment, oppression, undue burden (CI-3). Preserving the 
fundamental rights of suspects or others under criminal investigation (O-4). 
DE 203, Plaintiff's reply, contains numerous quotes from the protected deposition 
testimony taken from Non-Party Does and should remain sealed based on countervailing interests 
discussed above. 
7. Reasonable reliance on a protective order by a party or non-party (CI-1). 
Prevention of the abuse of court records and files (CI-2). Annoyance, 
embarrassment, oppression, undue burden (CI-3). Preserving the 
fundamental rights of suspects or others under criminal investigation (O-4). 
DE 204 and 204-1 relate to the deposition testimony of three Non-Party Does including J. 
Doe 1. All of the references to the Non-Parties and the testimony should remain sealed based on 
the countervailing interests discussed above. Exhibit 1 to DE 204 is the testimony of a J. Doe, yet 
to receive Notice, taken subject to the Protective Order which was relied on by the J. Doe. Exhibit 
EFTA00022975

to DE 204-1 is a "rough" transcript of a yet to be notice J. Doe also taken pursuant to the 
Protective Order. Exhibit 3 to DE 204-1 is deposition testimony taken of J. Doe I pursuant to the 
Protective Order. Although J. Doe 1 has not responded to the notice, J. Doe I made it clear in this 
deposition that J. Doe 1 did not want any further involvement in this matter and that J. Doe 1 was 
unable to accurately recall details of the events described as a result of a medical condition. DEs 
211, 212, and 212-1 are the same as DEs 203, 201 and 204-1 and should be treated identically. 
VII. DE 199 (and related DEs 200, 200-1, 228, 229, 229-1, 248, 249, and 249-1) are 
afforded the lowest presumption of public access and this Sealed Material should 
remain sealed. 
1. Reasonable reliance on a protective order by a party or non-party (CI-1). 
Prevention of the abuse of court records and files (CI-2). Annoyance, 
embarrassment, oppression, undue burden (CI-3). Preserving the 
fundamental rights of suspects or others under criminal investigation (CI-4) 
and Redactions of Names. 
These pleadings relate to Plaintiff's request for additional time to complete the depositions 
referenced in her pleadings related to her request for more depositions. Generally, the DEs 
reference Non-Party Does and refer in some instances to Non-Party deposition testimony taken 
under the guarantees of the Protective Order. The Court, prior to unsealing the Sealed Materials, 
will require the responses of yet to be notified Non-Party Does.' However, it appears that the 
volume of Sealed Material in these DEs is minimal. The Court could determine that the Sealed 
Materials remain sealed by application of countervailing interests CI-1 through CI-4. 
The following DEs contain references to Non-Parties: DE 228 references 14 non-parties; 
DE 229 references 5 non-parties; DE 229-1 references 33 non-parties; DE 248 references 17 non-
parties; DE 249 references 9 non-parties; DE 249-1 references 18 non-parties.

VIII. DE 164 (and related DEs 165, 165-8, 185-3, 185-11, 185-14, 185-15). Should Remain 
Sealed Pending Additional Non-Party Notice and Responses Pursuant to The 
Protocol. 
The pleadings related to DE 164 concern discovery related to a waiver of Plaintiff's 
attorney client privilege as a result of her lawyers' extrajudicial conduct and statements and 
Plaintiff's statements in other matters.' Accordingly, these materials are afforded the lowest 
presumption of public access. However, Ms. Maxwell anticipates that, subject to any objections 
from, yet-to-be-noticed, Non-Party Does she has no objection to the release of these materials. 
Release at this time is premature, because various Non-Parties may raise countervailing interests 
that must be addressed by the Court pursuant to the Protocol, 
IX. DE 230 and (and related DEs 235, 235-5, 235-7, 235-11, 235-13). Should Remain 
Sealed Pending Additional Non-Party Notice and Responses Pursuant to The 
Protocol. 
The Pleadings related to DE 230 concern the reopening of Plaintiff's deposition. 
Accordingly, these materials are afforded the lowest presumption of public access10. However, 
Ms. Maxwell anticipates that, subject to any objections from, yet-to-be-noticed, Non-Party Does 
she has no objection to the release of these materials. Release at this time is premature, because 
DE 165 is a lawyer declaration referencing the exhibit DE165-8; DE 185-3 is a Response 
to Motion to Intervene; DE 185-11 are pgs. from Plaintiff's deposition; DE 185-14 are pages from 
one of Plaintiff's lawyers' deposition; DE 185-15 is an interview between Plaintiff and two of her 
lawyers. 
The following DEs contain references to Non-Parties: DE 165 references 1 non-party; 
DE 165-8 references 1 non-party; DE 185-3 references 12 non-parties; DE 185-11 references 8 
non-parties; DE 185-14 references 1 non-party; DE 185-15 references 15 non-parties. 
DE 235 is a redacted lawyer declaration referencing a non-party and exhibits DE 235-5, 
235-7, 235-11, 235-13.; DE 235-5 contains letters between counsel; 235-7 is an expert from a 
non-party deposition, 235-11 is a privilege log; 235-13 is an errata sheet from a deposition.

Dear 
; Daniel Cundy 
Thank you for your email response claiming that US Attorney Berman's statements were factually accurate 
and did not create a misleading impression. 
EFTA00022980
--- PAGE 2 ---
We only have access to edited video and newspaper reporting of what the US Attorney said. Those reports 
suggest the US Attorney described the position of the Duke of York and his advisors in misleading, 
condemnatory and prejudicial terms. US Attorney Berman is quoted as having stated there has been "zero 
co-operation". This is not an accurate statement of the position. The following are also false statements 
ascribed to Mr Berman and to the DOJ/FBI: "F.B.I. agents and federal prosecutors in New York ... reached out 
to his lawyers and asked to interview him. There was no response at all, according to three people familiar 
with the investigation." (New York Times 27.01.20) and "Geoffrey Berman, a US attorney, said federal 
prosecutors and the FBI had asked to interview Prince Andrew about the late paedophile billionaire, but hod 
been met with a wall of silence"(The Telegraph 28.01.20). 
Please provide us with an accurate record of the statements made by The US Attorney and/or the Dal/FBI 
including a transcript of any relevant questions and answers. 
We note from your email that you have not provided any response to our request that you confirm that the 
DOJ will not be making any further public statements about the Duke of York. We had understood from our 
conversations with you and from the rules governing media relations that Dal personnel and the US 
Attorney would not comment on the nature or progress of any grand jury investigation and in particular 
would not comment on the willingness of any Subject to make a voluntary statement to the DOJ. We ask you 
to confirm that there will be no further public comment on any contact between the Duke of York and the 
DOJ.

Gary, 
Our understanding is that U.S. Attorney Berman made a factual statement in response to a specific question that 
suggested the Duke of York either would or was cooperating, and he responded that to date he has not in fact 
provided cooperation with our investigation. That is, he corrected the record generally in a factually accurate 
statement; I don't believe this would create a misleading impression. I appreciate that you have advised us that your 
client has a desire to cooperate, and we look forward to hearing from you when he has made a determination as to 
whether he is in fact willing to speak with us.

Daniel Cundy 
The press are reporting that Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York 
has disclosed what we understood were confidential communications between us and 
and 
It has also been suggested that Geoffrey S. Berman has stated that the Duke of York has not co-operated with the 
Southern District. As you know we have made it very clear that the Duke of York has a strong desire to cooperate 
with the ongoing investigation by the DOJ and we are trying to reach a position where we are able to advise him to

We are concerned about the misleading impression that has been created and the effect this has on our ability to 
advise the Duke to proceed with any voluntary co-operation. Please confirm that the DOJ will not be making any 
further public statements on this topic. 
Thank you.

Thank you for your response. It would be useful for us if you were able to help us understand the nature of the 
issues and procedures with which you are dealing, particularly as it sounds like it will take at least a couple 
additional weeks to address even minor preliminary issues, which suggests likely additional subsequent time to 
handle further processes—and without a response to the question of whether he is willing to speak with us, 
separate from a general desire to cooperate. Our investigation is moving forward expeditiously and so we would 
be grateful for some understanding of the relevant issues (especially, though not exclusively, to the extent we 
may be able to assist in their resolution) and would be happy to speak via phone if a real-time conversation

Thank you for your email. The Duke of York has made it clear to us that he has a strong desire to cooperate fully 
with the ongoing investigation by the DOJ. 
It is our responsibility to deal with the various issues and procedures that arise here that will need to be 
addressed to enable him to do so. We should be able to deal with at least some of the minor preliminary issues in 
the next two weeks and we will update you on our progress once we have done so.

Mr. Bloxsome, 
Thank you for your response and for confirming your representation. To respond to your question generally, 
in connection with our investigation of conduct relating to Jeffrey Epstein and certain of his associates, we 
wish to request a consensual, voluntary law enforcement interview with your client. Generally, we would 
expect to inquire about his relationship and communications with Jeffrey Epstein and his associates, as well 
as certain allegations that have arisen publicly and in our investigation to date. 
Although we recognize we separately have the ability to convey such a request through diplomatic and law 
enforcement channels, we understand we may also alternatively inquire directly with counsel, when an 
individual has legal representation. Given your representation, we are inquiring directly with counsel in the 
first instance. 
Certainly we can discuss our request in more detail, but we hope this will provide the information you were 
seeking as a threshold matter, and we look forward to being in touch. 
Regards, 
Assistant U.S. Attorney 
Southern District of New York

Subject: notes from tic with counsel to Prince Andrew 
Date: Fri, 10 Jan 2020 14:52:05 +0000 
- introductions 
o prosecutors and also two primary FBI agents 
- may be helpful to start by describing what we're requesting, and then we can answer any questions that we're able to 
o requesting a voluntary, consensual interview 
o how does such an interview ordinarily work? 
• not recorded, not videotaped or audiotaped; instead, agents take notes (and of course counsel can 
take notes as well) 
• the interview is not formally under oath, there's no swearing-in, but it is a crime in the U.S. to 
knowingly lie to federal law enforcement officers 
o again in terms of process, we do not publicize the content or even the existence of these interviews 
• obviously can't guarantee that no one who might come to know about the interview would tell the 
press, but our office does not advise the press of interviews 
• notably, it was reported months ago that we were attempting to interview Prince Andrew, which was 
inaccurate, and now we have been working on this request for approximately the past month and 
there have been no media reports about it 
o after we've completed an interview, we communicate with counsel as necessary, including with any required 
follow-up 
- so that's the process, in terms of the substance 
o explain target / subject / witness 
• ordinarily we don't confer a label like that unless asked, but those are the categories 
o subject matter we are interested in is, broadly, the nature and scope of client's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein 
and his associates, including professional associates, staff, and personal relationships, including Ghislaine 
Maxwell 
• how they came to know each other, how long they were in contact, what the nature of their contacts 
were, how often communicated 
• for Epstein in particular but also Epstein's associates 
o then in particular there have been public allegations from at least one individual and we would 
- able to identify targets? 
o no, can't identify targets, but ore not saying that their client is a target 
- expected timeline? 
o as soon as reasonably practicable (moving the investigation forward expeditiously), and with the goal of 
covering all relevant subjects in the initial meeting if possible 
- as matters stand, whether we would say he is a target / witness / subject? 
o subject, and noting that it is sometimes the case that individuals are a subject by default until there is sufficient 
information to classify them as a witness 
arties agreed to be in touch in the coming days

Sorry about the delay. Interlochen doesn't have any other documents regarding tuition payment information or 
payments by Epstein or Epstein entities. 
Let me know if you have any other questions. 
Thanks,

Hi 
I'm happy to have a call. I'm available Monday all morning, Tuesday until 10:30am and Wednesday all morning. 
I apologize about not getting back with you. I thought the other attorney that filed the response was going to do so. 
Regardless, the response included everything that Interlochen has. They only keep tuition payment information for 7 
years and nothing in their files reflects any payments by Epstein or Epstein entities. 
Thanks, 
Jeff

Jeff, 
I hope you are doing well. We still have not received a response to our inquiry from April of 2020. Would you be 
available for a call with our team next week to discuss, please? 
Thanks

Hi Jeff, 
No, I don't think you responded. Totally understandable given everything that has gone on in the last month. I'd still 
be grateful if you could get back to me on this point, please. 
Hope you are also staying safe and healthy.

Did we ever respond to you on this question? Things have gotten so complicated that I can't remember or 
determine. 
Hope you are staying safe and healthy.

Jeff and George, 
Thank you both very much for your assistance in response to our subpoenas seeking records from Interlochen. In 
reviewing the documents you produced in response to the attached subpoena, a follow-up question arose. Would 
you please confirm that your production included all records of any tuition payments that Epstein (or his entities) 
made for any students at Interlochen? 
Our team is also happy to discuss this inquiry over the phone if that would be useful. I am starting a trial tomorrow 
and will have limited availability this week, but my colleagues 
and 
(both cc'd) should be 
able to coordinate with you as needed. 
Best,

Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. Per our conversation, we understand that Interlochen will keep this request
