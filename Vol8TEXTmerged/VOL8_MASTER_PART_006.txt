Hi 
Attached please see the transcript from the first appearance in front of Judge Freeman. On page 15 (lines 7-15), Robbie 
mentions that she has been told that Mark Epstein is the beneficiary of the estate.

you could send it, though no rush at all on that — anytime early next week would be totally fine.

That is what Bennet Moskowitz said (I believe) at the earlier conference before M.J. Freeman 
Alex: can you pls check the transcript? I know they have also said it to me directly and he certainly didn't disagree with 
me when I said it before J Failla. 
Also: we got the Feinberg draft protocol today; its exactly as much of a disaster as we expected. 
Kate: psl send to

This is helpful and interesting, thanks very much for sending. Among other things, notable that Judge Failla assumes, even 
were punitive damages to be excluded, a claim "for millions upon millions of dollars." 
Separately, Robbie, I noticed near the end of the conference you mentioned, at p. 27, that: "They [the estate and/or the 
trustees?] have identified the sole beneficiary as Mr. Epstein's brother." I'm wondering if you might have a recollection of 
what the estate has said or represented to you about that? And if you recall whether any discussion of beneficiaries was 
in connection with the will versus the trust versus the estate, etc. Just if you feel comfortable sharing any of that 
information, of course—no obligation at all. And if it's more convenient to relay in real time, rather than drafting up an 
email, please don't hesitate to give a call. No emergency or rush, but did want to ask.

Jeff, 
Following up on our phone conversation today, I wanted to memorialize that, as discussed, we do not currently have 
reason to believe Ms. 
has criminal exposure based on what we are aware of in connection with her interactions 
with Jeffrey Epstein, and your brief attorney proffer regarding the circumstances of those interactions are consistent with 
that view. In your further discussions with Ms. 
in advance of a further attorney proffer to address the general 
nature of her relationship with Mr. Epstein, as well as his employees or relevant close associates, if you have any concerns 
about additional possible exposure you should please feel free to be in touch with us again. As we also discussed, I 
believe any non-federal offenses would be well outside the relevant statute(s) of limitation, but of course if you wish to 
further research that issue, or consult with criminal counsel, we defer to you entirely.

Hi Jeff, 
Thanks very much—I appreciate the heads up about scheduling, and that's not a problem, we can definitely work around 
your schedule. With respect to notification, we have no objection to Interlochen notifying the students (who are now 
adults) about the subpoena. As we discussed, we would otherwise request that you refrain from disclosing to third 
parties. 
Thanks, and hope you have a good weekend—

Just confirming receipt. Also, I'm hopeful that we can have everything gathered by April 12th. However, I'll be out of the 
office for the next week so it might be delayed. Will that be a problem? 
In addition, and just for confirmation's sake, you are ok that we will make reasonable efforts to notify the 
parents/students of the subpoena prior to compliance with the subpoena correct?

Regardless, the response included everything that Interlochen has. They only keep tuition payment information for 7 
years and nothing in their files reflects any payments by Epstein or Epstein entities. 
Thanks, 
Jeff

Thank you both very much for your assistance in response to our subpoenas seeking records from Interlochen. In 
reviewing the documents you produced in response to the attached subpoena, a follow-up question arose. Would 
you please confirm that your production included all records of any tuition payments that Epstein (or his entities) 
made for any students at Interlochen? 
Our team is also happy to discuss this inquiry over the phone if that would be useful. I am starting a trial tomorrow 
and will have limited availability this week, but my colleagues 
and 
(both cc'd) should be 
able to coordinate with you as needed.

Following up on point number 7, that gap would not come in between those two productions but would instead be 
contained solely in the November 18, 2020 production. If you are missing those files, the omission was unintentional, and 
we have those files available to produce immediately. If you can send a link to your ftp site, our paralegal can upload 
those materials right away.

Chris, 
We are available for a call to discuss tomorrow between 1pm and 2pm, between 3pm and 5pm, or after 5:30pm. Please 
let us know if there is a time in those windows that would work on your end. In the meantime, below are some initial 
responses: 
1. Our supervisors have indicated that we are not permitted to send a drive that our IT department did not load to 
the MDC. As a result, we cannot provide the drive directly to the MDC. That said, I am happy to join you in asking 
the MDC to accept the drive from you. If the MDC still refuses, then my office would not object to an application to 
Judge Nathan for an order directing the MDC to accept the drive from you, though we would need to allow MDC 
legal counsel the opportunity to note their objections to Judge Nathan. 
2. The MDC recently alerted us to this issue, and our paralegal converted the excel files at issue to pdfs and sent a 
new CD with those pdfs to the MDC. If you client still cannot view them, then we are happy to load them to a drive 
if you would like to provide one for us. 
3. I have asked our vendor to look into this issue and will get back to you when I have spoken with them. 
4. I have asked our vendor to look into this issue and will get back to you when I have spoken with them. That said, 
similar to the note I sent in my email regarding highly confidential images on March 16, 2021, the electronic files 
recovered from Epstein's devices have the same metadata on the hard drive that was available when the FBI seized 
each file. For files that were carved or deleted, no metadata was recovered, so none is viewable, except for data 
showing when a particular file was saved to a drive by the investigative team or prepared for production. 
5. As indicated in our November 9, 2020 discovery letter, all images within Bates range SDNY_GM_00467566 though 
SDNY_GM_00514100 were seized during the 2019 searches of Epstein residences. These are the images from the 
CDs that were recovered during those searches, so they did not come from any of the electronic devices that were 
EFTA00019596
--- PAGE 3 ---
the subject of extractions by CART. As a result, these images would not have CART numbers. As for the metadata, I 
have asked our vendor to look into this issue and will get back to you when I have spoken with them. 
6. I have asked our vendor to look into this issue and will get back to you when I have spoken with them. That said, I 
note again that the electronic files recovered from Epstein's devices have the same metadata on the hard drive that 
was available when the FBI seized each file. For files that were carved or deleted, no metadata was recovered, so 
none is viewable. Additionally, as indicated in our November 9, 2020 discovery letter, all images within the 
SDNY011 load file (Bates range SDNY_GM_00467566 though SDNY_GM_00514100) were seized during the 2019 
searches of Epstein residences. These are the images from the CDs that were recovered during those searches, so 
they did not come from any of the electronic devices that were the subject of extractions by CART. As a result, 
these images would not have CART numbers. 
7. I have asked our paralegals and vendor to look into the Bates gap and will get back to you when I have spoken to 
them.

and

We write to raise a few issues concerning the discovery. Below is the list of items. Please let me know if you are free for a 
call to discuss. 
1. On our last call, we asked you if we could send our client a hard drive containing the discovery that we had created 
(without the highly confidential items). You had said you would check to see if you could facilitate this. We have 
not heard back from you. Are you able to send Ms. Maxwell the hard drive? 
2. The last two productions you sent to Ms. Maxwell on disks. As you know, she cannot read disks on her laptop and 
must use the prison computer. But the prison computer cannot read some of the files. We can include these files 
on our hard drive to send to Ms. Maxwell. Otherwise, you will need to produce them on a hard drive. Please 
advise which way you would like to proceed. 
3. A number of the emails in the discovery — over 109,000 — were produced without their attachments (see tab 1 of 
the attached Excel file). Instead, the attachments appear as slip-sheets (see example attached). Please provide the 
EFTA00019597
--- PAGE 4 ---
missing attachments, if they exist. 
4. A number of electronic documents — over 110,000 — that were extracted from one of Epstein's devices, as identified 
by a CART number, have metadata that indicates a "date created" or "date last modified" date in July 2020 or 
afterwards (see tab 2 of the attached Excel file). We request that you produce a metadata overlay with the original 
metadata for these files. 
5. A number of photographs — over 6500 — were produced in native format, but do not have a CART number and have 
"date created" and/or "date last modified" dates after July 2019 (see tab 3 of the attached Excel file). Please 
provide the CART number for these photographs or specify which device they came from. Also, we request that 
you produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files. 
6. A number of the audio/visual files — over 460 — have similar metadata issues (see tab 4 of the attached Excel file). 
These fall into the following buckets: 
a. SDNY GM SUPP: these have CART numbers, but were produced without metadata load files and have 
"date created" and "date last modified" dates in September-November 2020, after the date the device was 
seized. We request that you produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files. 
b. SDNY005 (October 20 2020 production): these are a few videos from the SDFL or PBPD investigations that 
were produced in native form without metadata load files. They have Sept-Oct 2020 dates. We request that 
you produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files. 
c. SDNY011 (November 9 2020 production): these were produced in native form with load files, but do not 
reference a CART number and have Sept 2020 dates. We request that you provide a CART number for these 
files or indicate their source. Also, we request that you produce a metadata overlay with the original 
metadata for these files. 
7. There is a gap between 11/18 and 12/18 production numbers (SDNY_GM_02742044 to 2742183). Was that 
intentional or are we missing those documents? 
Please let us know your responses as soon as possible.

Re: 
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
Dear Counsel: 
We write in response to your March 8, 2021 letter, which requests the disclosure of: 
(1) documents produced to Radar Online in the matter of Radar Online v. FBI, 17 Civ. 3956 
(PGG); (2) "any other FOIA requests that have produced documents pertaining to any investigation 
of Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell"; and (3) "any materials that reflect the involvement of 
the FBI-New York Office in the USAO-SDFL investigation." We address each request in turn 
below. 
First, you have requested that we produce to you all materials that were produced to Radar 
Online pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act ("FOIA") in connection with the civil lawsuit 
Radar Online v. FBI, 17 Civ. 3956 (PGG). As an initial matter, your letter fails to articulate any 
legal basis for that request under Rule 16, or any other law governing criminal discovery. 
Moreover, to the extent that you assert that you need to know when information received by Radar 
Online through FOIA may have been published by the media, any information about the date of 
publication would presumably be publicly available and, in any event, not information within the 
Government's possession, custody or control. 
EFTA00019599
--- PAGE 2 ---
Page 2 
Notwithstanding the above, we have been informed by an attorney in the General Counsel's 
Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation that all materials produced pursuant to the FOIA 
request made in connection with Radar Online v. FBI, 17 Civ. 3956 (PGG) are publicly available 
on the FBI's website: https://vault.fbi.gov. Furthermore, and without conceding any obligation to 
do so, as a courtesy, we will provide you with the cover letters that accompanied the productions 
to Radar Online. 
The Government is providing materials stamped with control numbers 
SDNY GM 02743189 through SDNY_GM_02743292 under separate cover. 
Second, you have requested that we search the files of the prosecution team' for "any other 
FOIA requests that have produced documents pertaining to any investigation of Jeffrey Epstein or 
Ghislaine Maxwell and produce to us the documents made public through the FOIA requests, the 
dates the documents were produced and the identity of the recipient of the documents." Your letter 
offers no legal basis for this request, and in the absence of further explanation for your request, we 
see none. FOIA concerns public disclosure of agency records; it has no bearing on whether 
information is subject to discovery in criminal or civil cases. See, e.g., NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & 
Co., 421 U.S. 132, 143 n. 10 (1975) ("The Act is fundamentally designed to inform the public 
about agency action and not to benefit private litigants."). In particular, to the extent this request 
seeks the identity of any individual or entity who made a FOIA request, along with corresponding 
information about how the Government acted on such a request, we are unaware of any basis in 
law for such a request, and we invite you to point us to such authority. To the extent this request 
seeks materials produced in response to any FOIA request pertaining to any investigation of 
Epstein, we are similarly unaware of any basis in law for such a broad request. Our discovery 
obligations are not governed by FOIA but instead by Rule 16 and rules applicable to criminal 
discovery, all of which we have complied with and intend to continue complying with fully. 
Accordingly, we are not producing materials in response to your request at this juncture. 
Third, you have requested that the Government "produce any materials that reflect the 
involvement of the FBI-New York Office in the USAO-SDFL investigation." In response, the 
Government is providing materials stamped with control numbers SDNY_GM_02743143 through 
SDNY-  GM r  02743188 in response to this request as a courtesy. This production should not be 
taken to indicate that the Government believes it has any obligation, under Rule 16 or otherwise, 
to do so; rather, we make this production as a courtesy in response to your request. 
' Your letter erroneously asserts that the FBI's Florida office is part of the prosecution team in this 
case. We would direct you to our October 7, 2020 letter to the Court, in which we detailed the 
entities that are part of this prosecution team. 
EFTA00019600
--- PAGE 3 ---
Page 3 
Finally, we have considered the concern you have raised regarding the language in our 
October 7, 2020 letter and have filed a letter with the Court addressing the matter. 
Very truly yours, 
AUDREY STRAUSS

Hey-
That sounds good to me, thanks. I think it makes sense to discuss our theory of the case, both on the wbtw scheme and 
on the possible PPE scam, just to make sure everyone is on the same page as we continue reviewing. In particular, now 
that 
is openly taking a salary, we should discuss materiality—I don't think those issues are prohibitive at all, but it 
might be helpful to make sure everyone is attuned to those issues as we review. 
In terms of staffing, can we add M? I know he'd want to do it. Apologies that I haven't been working on this case since 
we moved to remote work—I reviewed emails before we left the office, but haven't continued since then. In terms of 
bandwidth, Epstein/Rikers stuff has been taking up my time, although I'm hopeful that will relent a bit over the summer 
(or that someone up the chain will get tired of reading memos?). More immediately, I should be able to dig into email 
review probably starting next weekish. Regardless, don't be shy about passing things off to me if you think of things we 
should be doing that I'm not spotting.

hey - thought it made sense to check in before our call tomorrow. in terms of current status, i think we continue to review 
the email returns, schedule the new financials and dig in on this covid scheme that 
is doing, and probably do 
another warrant (either a refresh or some new accounts). 
is going to assign a GCer to do priv review, and I'm 
continuing to hassle I=. 
about the iCloud returns. What's your bandwidth like? I know you're probably busy with 
Epstein and Rikers stuff. We're getting close to doing a superseder in the Ukrainians case, but then I'm pretty free until my 
currently scheduled trial in September (which I bet gets moved, but who knows). I think it may make sense to add a third 
person to assist with email review and pushing this closer to charging. There are some people in our unit who are slow, 
and/or GC is actually pretty slow except for compassionate release. On the other hand, fine to wait on this if you think we 
should. Let me know.

Re: Grand Jury Subpoena dated August 26, 2020 (Google Ref. No. 3971083) 
2018R01618; 20 MAG 9134 
Dear 
www.google.com 
Pursuant to the Grand Jury Subpoena issued in the above-referenced matter, we have 
conducted a diligent search for documents and information accessible on Google's systems that 
are responsive to your request. Our response is made in accordance with state and federal law, 
including the Electronic Communications Privacy Act. See 18 U.S.C. § 2701 et seq. 
Accompanying this letter is responsive information to the extent reasonably accessible 
from our system associated with the Google account(s) 
that used 
as Google account sign-in(s) 
as specified in the Grand Jury 
Subpoena. We have also included a signed Certificate of Authenticity which includes a list of 
hash values that correspond to each file contained in the production. Google may not retain a 
copy of this production but does endeavor to keep a list of the files and their respective hash 
values. To the extent any document provided herein contains information exceeding the scope of 
your request, protected from disclosure or otherwise not subject to production, if at all, we have 
redacted such information or removed such data fields. 
Google objects and has not produced records associated with Google accounts for which 
you have not expressly provided an account identifier or which derive from records or other 
information of the subject account(s) that you seek to have Google search. Because this exceeds 
the scope of 18 U.S.C. § 2703(c)(2), Google requires a court order pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 
2703(d) based on specific and articulable facts showing that the accounts linked by secondary 
email address are relevant and material to your investigation for the duration of the time period 
requested. Moreover, bulk requests for information about a large number of unidentified or 
unspecified Google users is both burdensome to Google and may implicate the First Amendment 
or other rights of Google users. See In re Grand Jury Subpoena to Amazon.com Dated August 7, 
2006, 246 F.R.D. 570, 573 (D. Wis. 2007) (applying First Amendment analysis to grand jury 
subpoena for bulk Amazon customer data). To the extent you seek information about additional 
Google accounts, Google can comply with legal process that expressly contains an account 
identifier for each of those accounts that you determine are relevant to your investigation. 
The identifier(s), 
, you provided is not unique and cannot be 
associated to a specific subscriber's account. Therefore, we do not have documents responsive to 
your request for this identifier.

After a diligent search and reasonable inquiry, we have found no records for any Google 
account-holder(s) identified as 
. Therefore, we do not have documents responsive 
to your request. 
Please note that a subpoena is not sufficient process to compel production of the account 
status associated with the specified account. The scope of information available pursuant to a 
subpoena is limited to the items specified in section 2703(cX2) of the Electronic Communications 
Privacy Act ("ECPA"). 18 U.S.C. §2701 et seq. A court order issued under section 2703(d) or a 
search warrant is required to compel production of other "record[s] or other information" such as 
the account status of a specified account. 18 U.S.C.2703(c)(1). 
Please note that Google Pay service data is under the control of Google Payment 
Corporation. Any request for such data must be specifically addressed to Google Payment 
Corporation and can be served through the email address 
For a Google Custodian of Records, we will require a subpoena and confirmation from 
you of the time and date of the appearance, the scope of testimony, any Google Reference 
Number(s) associated with the case, and the travel for the appearance at least one week in 
advance in order to identify, make the appropriate plans for, and prepare a custodian for trial. 
Finally, in accordance with Section 2706 of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, 
Google may request reimbursement for reasonable costs incurred in processing your request.

Dear Nick 
I hope this email finds you well. Since we last spoke, 
I wanted to check a few things with you if I may on the Ghislaine Maxwell case: 
1) Is it correct to say that there will now be TWO trials - the first on the child sex trafficking charges (covering the 
period 1994-2004) and the second on the 2016 perjury charges? 
2) Is the main trial still scheduled to start in November? 
3) Is there any date set aside for the perjury trial? 
4) What does this mean for the maximum sentence that Maxwell can now receive? I think we previously talked settled 
on up to 80 years behind bars. 
5) Is the investigation into Maxwell and Epstein's network still ongoing? 
EFTA00019656
--- PAGE 2 ---
6) If so, does Prince Andrew remain a person of interest? Have US prosecutors managed to get a statement from him 
yet or are there any arrangements in the pipeline to do so? 
I'd be grateful if you could drop me line with some responses within the next 48 hours if at possible please. Many 
thanks 
All the best

background: previously Epstein sued the lawyer, claiming that the lawyer was involved in an unrelated fraud that 
the lawyer's law partner was convicted of-- the fraud related to an Epstein business. The lawyer is now suing 
Epstein for malicious prosecution, claiming that he wrongfully filed the old lawsuit in retaliation for representing 
Epstein's victims.

Thanks for checking in. Regarding the production format for the wire information, unless it's burdensome or the materials 
are very voluminous, we'd like to receive both the Excel and PDF versions. Let us know, though, if that's an issue. For the 
second question, why don't you produce the information as it's currently organized in the first instance, and we can get a 
sense of the volume, structure, searchability, etc. If we then think it would be useful to receive the information by 
account (which I think ordinarily is easiest for us, though may not be necessary here), we can circle back, if that all sounds 
alright to you?

We are preparing to produce account lists early next week. We have also started to receive certain wire information, but 
wanted to discuss the format of that data with you before producing it. 
First the wire information is available in two formats that contain identical information: PDF and Excel. For each 
transaction, the PDF version has a two-page summary of date, amount, sender, recipient, and other related information. 
The two-page summaries are compiled chronologically into a single multi-page PDF across all of the individual's accounts. 
The Excel version includes all of the same information, but each transaction is reflected in a single row. The Excel format 
is more easily accessible on our end, and we assume that it is more useful for you. Therefore, we would propose to 
produce only the Excel version, but please let us know if you would like the PDF compilations as well. 
EFTA00019689
--- PAGE 2 ---
Second the wire information is pulled by client name and is organized chronologically across all of that individual's 
accounts. (Note that pulling by name also pulls in instances where the individual's name is mentioned only in the 
payment details, even where the individual is neither sending nor receiving the money.) The account information for 
sender and recipient is visible for each transaction, but because the account may be in the "Order," "Debit," or "Credit" 
Party fields, it is not easily sortable by account number. In light of your request below, please let us know if you would like 
us to organize the data by account before production. This will take a little work for the Excel format, but is feasible. 
Given the volume of transactions, it would be incredibly time-consuming to reorganize the PDF compilations. 
Happy to discuss further. 
Thanks and have a great weekend, 
Allison

Thanks, and this all makes sense. We're happy to get wire information on a rolling basis, and other than that I think it 
probably will be most efficient for us to receive the priority categories together (as to any individual account) unless there 
will be a significant time lag due to any particular type of record, which we're happy to be in touch about as you get your 
arms around the materials. And as always we can be in touch as the process progresses to refine the approach as useful.

Thanks= We're aiming to provide a list of accounts (along with account types) for each of Epstein, S 
and 
Maxwell by the end of this week or early next week. 
We are prioritizing the collection of 
and Maxwell documents, and will also prioritize Butterfly Trust documents. 
We will do our best to organize the documents in a way that's easily digestible and will certainly provide indices. As you 
EFTA00019690

noted, some information may be available to us sooner (e.g., wire information) than others (e.g., account statements). 
Assuming that you'd prefer that we provide information quickly, we'll plan to produce such account information on a 
rolling basis, but we are happy to hold off until we have collected all of the priority categories — account statements, wire 
records, account opening documents, and KYC materials — for a given account. Let us know your preference.

EXTERNAL SENDER 
Anjan, Allison, 
Following up on our discussion earlier this week, wanted to provide some additional information and to confirm some of 
what we spoke about. We had talked about the likely usefulness of an index—or other description or list—of the number 
and type of accounts that would be covered by the requests in each of the subpoenas; we certainly understand that may 
take time, but do you have an estimate of approximately when that information would be available? 
As we discussed, although the investigation continues to move forward quickly in all aspects, to the extent the pending 
sub oenas are being processed in some serial order, the subpoenas relating to Ghislaine Maxwell and 
dated August 16 and September 3, respectively, are more time-sensitive for us than the subpoenas relating 
to Jeffrey Epstein, dated August 11. (Please note that there is a typo in the September 3 subpoena—in the "NAME" field, 
the second name should say' 
rather than 
please let us know if we need to serve a 
corrected version of the subpoena for your records.) 
For the Maxwell and 
subpoenas, we are especially interested in incoming check and wire information, as well as 
account statements, in the first instance. And as we also talked about, more generally we are prepared to receive 
productions on a rolling basis, with account statements, wire records, account opening documents, and KYC materials 
being prioritized in particular. And if you're able to keep us posted on the likely scope of responsive documents, we'll use 
that information to further focus and target our requests. 
In terms of logistics, I think I neglected to mention this on the phone, but wanted to also note that we sometimes receive 
Wntity subpoena responses that are unusually disorganized—either not separated by account, or that only include 
account statements and not other associated requested materials, or unaccompanied by an index or other way to discern 
what materials are reflected in thousands or tens of thousands of pages in a production, etc. My recollection from prior 
fights withMis that this is in significant part due to the fact that their records still need to be individually printed and 
scanned for production (and that a fully-electronic review and production system, while in progress, is still a year or two 
away). We're of course very heartened that these particular productions will go through you, which I imagine will 
mitigate those issues, but we do want to formally request that any productions be organized by account, produced in 
electronic format, and accompanied by indices linked to production numbers so we can make sense of what we receive. 
Finally, with respect to areas of particular focus, we would like to request expedited production of any records relating to 
accounts in the name of, or for the benefit of, "Butterfly Trust," in connection with the Epstein subpoenas. 
Please let us know if any additional information would be useful, thanks again for talking with us last week, and we look 
forward to being in touch again soon.

Very good to hear from you, and I apologize for the delay in replying to your voicemail from Friday — I was on trial last 
week so have spent the past couple days digging out from under piles of emails and voicemails. But we'd be happy 
to speak with you regarding the subpoenas to the JPMorgan entities in connection with the Epstein investigation. 
We had been in touch with Steve D'Allessandro, who was very helpful, but he also mentioned that they might bring 
in outside counsel. 
If you let us know a couple times that would work for you tomorrow or Friday—and I'm copying my colleagues 
anc 
who are also working on the case—we'll get a quorum on our side and finalize a time. And please let 
us know if any other information would be useful in the interim.

Hi 
We are requesting that information today and will give it to you when we get it. 
In the meantime, we had heard that the Marshals may have a form that Epstein may have/may not have signed noting 
he had suicidal tendencies, and this happened around 8/1. Do you know anything about this? 
Give me a call with any questions, thanks.

He did, but 
is the one who spoke directly with him, so he can give you the most detail. (I took 
off this, so he 
doesn't respond with the substance and create needless 3500.) The most significant takeaway I recall from 
summary was that "_" 
said he gave Epstein the sheets he used. But again, this is second-hand, and 
has his own 
issues we can discuss separately.

several months, 
has been desperately trying to figure out how he can cooperate, often relying on second- and

week about the relative quality of his information. 
I leave it to you guys to follow up with

Gloria just left me a vm— she said the client is a victim form the 90s and is willing to be interviewed on Wednesday. I 
think she wants to know soon whether we want to do that, because it affects trial arrangements. I'll be on trial on 
Wednesday, so defer to you as to whether that fits your schedules.

Similar to prior requests in connection with the Epstein investigation (2018R01618), we'd like to please request 
permission to travel next week for an interview in West Palm Beach on November 4. It will just be me and 
and 
we'll travel some combination of the 3rd to the 5th. And also same as last time, we'd like to ask permission to reserve a 
conference room at the hotel on that Monday for the interview, please.

Again in connection with the Epstein investigation (2018R01618), we'd like to please request permission to travel next 
week for a victim interview in Los Angeles. As of now we tentatively expect to fly down Wednesday and return no later 
than Friday (and will keep the timeframe as short as scheduling allows). The trip will be some combination of me, M, 
and/or 
as previously. And also same as last time, we'd like to ask permission to reserve a conference room at

Again in connection with the Epstein investigation, we'd like to please request permission to travel for approximately 
three days next week for meetings and interviews in West Palm Beach, Florida. As of now we tentatively expect to fly 
down Tuesday night and return on Wednesday or Thursday (and will keep the timeframe as short as scheduling allows). 
Unfortunately we're still trying to pin down timing for interviewing the victims, so depending on the timing it will either 
be me and 
or 
and 
but we wanted to ask for permission now either way so we weren't doing it 
super last minute after the holiday on Tuesday. And also same as last time, we'd like to ask permission to reserve a 
conference room at the hotel for the interviews, please.

Gloria just left me a vm— she said the client is a victim form the 90s and is willing to be interviewed on 
Wednesday. I think she wants to know soon whether we want to do that, because it affects trial arrangements. I'll 
be on trial on Wednesday, so defer to you as to whether that fits your schedules.

Gloria, 
We will make ourselves available to meet with your new client on 10/23. Because the victim meeting is being run by 
the FBI, their victim services folks are handling travel logistics. I'm cc'ing 
who should be able to 
hopefully help coordinate travel. Would you please provide 
with your new client's name as it appears on her

The taint team here apparently received materials from the search of the New York house but it's way fewer documents 
than we would have expected. Can you please let us know exactly how many electronic devices (phones, computers, hard 
drives, thumb drives, and/or discs) were sent to CART for processing, and how many were in fact processed and sent back 
to us? Or if it's easier to just put us in touch with the CART people directly, that's fine too. My understanding was that 
they were processing the materials in the attached, which appears to list approximately 38 computers and/or electronic 
storage devices seized along with an additional approximately 55 CDs.

reported publicly. Please advise when we can expect to receive either a written report on those basic facts or when we can 
have a call to get that information to relay to his counsel. It is extraordinarily frustrating to have to tell them that we have

Hey guys, 
just wanted me to reach out to you guys, I interviewed the air traffic control guy Pat, and through a couple 
phone calls, we believe that St. Thomas Jet Center (340-777-9177, Pat Hatch, employee) dealt with Epstein's 
helicopter. I called over there to confirm and they said the company has no comment and will not confirm 
anything regarding Epstein. Just wanted you guys to know in the event a subpoena was needed.

Following up on the below, wanted to make sure the attached letter from the Warden immediately got to Mike as well (in 
addition to Marty and Reid having been copied and emailed). As the letter indicates, there are now investigations 
ongoing, including as initiated by the Attorney General himself. Separately, we have not received additional information 
on topics such as the apparent cause of death, the status of observation of Mr. Epstein at the time, etc., but we will 
continue to be in touch immediately if that changes.

Subject: RE: Epstein suicide -- counseling for victims? 
Date: Sat, 10 Aug 2019 19:21:38 +0000 
With apologies for the weekend email, we have gotten questions from counsel about whether there is any availability for 
crisis (or other immediate or near-term) counseling for victims, given Epstein's death? My sense is that some victims may 
be struggling with the idea that their accusations could remain unvindicated as a result of these events. Is there any 
information we might be able to pass along to them and/or their counsel? I'm also free to discuss via phone if that's 
helpful 
I. Thank you very much!

Safe Horizon has two people that WILL GIVE SUPPORT AND COUNSELING TO Epstein Victims. 
Victoria Dexter (VP, Mental Health Treatment) and Sherri Papamihalis (Clinical Director — Counseling Center.) Our 
Counseling Center has available slots, so perhaps you guys can all connect and see if that would be the right fit for the 
victims in the Epstein case. Thanks! Sherri phone number is 718 9286914 
I hope this helps. I know she is in Florida but thought if anyone else asks you this is a great resource.

PROFFER AGREEMENT 
With respect to the meeting of 
("Client") and his/her attorney, 
Esq., with Assistant United States Attorney 
 to be held at the Office of the 
United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York on [Meeting Date] ("the meeting"), 
the following understandings exist: 
(1) THIS IS NOT A COOPERATION AGREEMENT. The Client has agreed to 
provide the Government with information, and to respond to questions, so that the Government 
may evaluate Client's information and responses in making prosecutive decisions. By receiving 
Client's proffer, the Government does not agree to make a motion on the Client's behalf or to enter 
into a cooperation agreement, plea agreement, immunity or non-prosecution agreement. The 
Government makes no representation about the likelihood that any such agreement will be reached 
in connection with this proffer. 
(2) In any prosecution brought against Client by this Office, except as provided below the 
Government will not offer in evidence on its case-in-chief, or in connection with any sentencing 
proceeding for the purpose of determining an appropriate sentence, any statements made by Client 
at the meeting, except (a) in a prosecution for false statements, obstruction of justice or perjury 
with respect to any acts committed or statements made during or after the meeting or testimony 
given after the meeting; or (b) if, at any time following the meeting, Client becomes a fugitive 
from justice. 
(3) Notwithstanding item (2) above: (a) the Government may use information derived 
directly or indirectly from the meeting for the purpose of obtaining leads to other evidence, which 
evidence may be used in any prosecution of Client by the Government; (b) in any prosecution 
brought against Client, the Government may use statements made by Client at the meeting and all 
evidence obtained directly or indirectly therefrom for the purpose of cross-examination should 
Client testify; and (c) the Government may also use statements made by Client at the meeting to 
rebut any evidence or arguments offered by or on behalf of Client (including arguments made or 
issues raised sua soonte by the District Court) at any stage of the criminal prosecution (including 
bail, all phases of trial, and sentencing) in any prosecution brought against Client. 
(4) The Client understands and agrees that in the event the Client seeks to qualify for a 
reduction in sentence under Title 18, United States Code, Section 3553(0, United States 
Sentencing Guidelines, Sections 2D1.1(b)(18) or 5C1.2, or Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(b), the Office may 
offer or use at any stage of the criminal proceeding any statement made by Client during the 
meeting, and all evidence obtained directly or indirectly therefrom, to the extent such use is 
consistent with Section 402 of the First Step Act of 2018. 
(5) To the extent that the Government is entitled under this Agreement to offer in evidence 
any statements made by Client or leads obtained therefrom, Client shall assert no claim under the 
United States Constitution, any statute, Rule 410 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, or any other 
federal rule that such statements or any leads therefrom should be suppressed. It is the intent of 
this Agreement to waive all rights in the foregoing respects. 
01.14.2019 
EFTA00019831
--- PAGE 2 ---
(6) If this Office receives a request from another prosecutor's office for access to 
information obtained pursuant to this Proffer Agreement, this Office may furnish such information 
but will do so only on the condition that the requesting office honor the provisions of this 
Agreement. 
(7) It is further understood that this Agreement is limited to the statements made by Client 
at the meeting and does not apply to any oral, written or recorded statements made by Client at 
any other time. No understandings, promises, agreements and/or conditions have been entered 
into with respect to the meeting other than those set forth in this Agreement and none will be 
entered into unless in writing and signed by all parties. 
(8) The understandings set forth in paragraphs l through 7 above extend to the continuation 
of this meeting on the dates that appear below. 
(9) Client and Attorney acknowledge that they have fully discussed and understand every 
paragraph and clause in this Agreement and the consequences thereof.

email. I sent a separate email with 
them, but I've copied the details below just in case: 
I'd like to arrange the following travel, all with refundable tickets, please: 
December 15, 2019 -11:40 AM Delta flight from JFK to LAX 
December 16, 2019 — 4:15 PM United flight from LAX to IAD 
December 17, 2019 — Amtrak 6:00 PM train from DC to NYC 
I'd also like to book a room in the Double Tree Santa Monica for one night, checking in December 15, 2019 and checking 
out December 16, 2019 in LA, please. No need for a hotel in DC, as I'll be staying with family. 
We do not need a conference room for any portion of this trip. 
Thank you!

In connection with this trip, could you please assist with booking the following travel? Thanks! 
• 
Hotel—same as last time, the DoubleTree in Santa Monica is fine. Checking in 12/15, checking out the next day 
• 
We do not need a conference room 
• 
Outbound flight: Sunday, 12/15, departing JFK at 11:40 am on Delta, landing at LAX at 3:01 p.m. 
• 
Inbound flight: Monday, 12/16, departing LAX at 8:32 p.m. on JetBlue, landing at JFK at 4:47 a.m. 
• 
If you could please make all flights refundable, that would be great — it's possible we'll need to rebook parts of 
this if witness availability changes or we're able to stay longer and meet with an additional witness. 
Thanks a bunch.

Again in connection with the Epstein investigation, we'd like to please request permission to travel for approximately 
three days next week for meetings and interviews in West Palm Beach, Florida. As of now we tentatively expect to fly 
down Tuesday night and return on Wednesday or Thursday (and will keep the timeframe as short as scheduling allows). 
Unfortunately we're still trying to pin down timing for interviewing the victims, so depending on the timing it will either 
be me and

but we wanted to ask for permission now either way so we weren't doing it 
super last minute after the holiday on Tuesday. And also same as last time, we'd like to ask permission to reserve a

Thanks for flagging. Let's produce in their original format to both for now. If Maxwell has trouble opening them at MDC, 
we'll deal with that after she tells us she can't open them. She has not identified every single excel and txt file from past 
productions as problematic, so she will hopefully be able to open these.

2. We are working on that. 
3. I suppose database load files? We want to retain the files as they are currently formatted as best we can. 
4. That won't be an issue. I don't think we will be searching through them; the purpose is just to be able to stamp

The files in question number about 40,000 and are about 300GB in size. They are currently copying onto a drive to be sent

HIM, 
You and the team there may have already seen this, but in view of the importance of the issue, I wanted to pass it along. 
Attached is the transcript of the hearing from Florida state court in 2008, in which Epstein pled guilty to Florida state 
charges. During the course of questioning by the judge, Epstein's Florida attorney (Jack Goldberger) stated (on Epstein's 
behalf) that the NPA contained an obligation by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida "not [to) 
prosecute Mr. Epstein in the Southern District of Florida ...." See page 38 (emphasis added). I wanted you to be sure to 
have this information, as the subject is likely to be important.

but we wanted to talk with you about a question in connection with your expertise on the CVRA generally. At your 
convenience.

Subject: RE: Briefing in Florida regarding whether the Florida NPA extends to New York 
EFTA00019855
--- PAGE 3 ---
Hi M, 
I wanted to make you aware of a recent filing (on Tuesday) by Jane Doe 1 and 2 in the Florida CVRA case. See 
attached. You may find interesting our argument at pp. 3-6, in which we explain why Judge Marra must craft remedies 
in the case that relate solely to Florida crimes and Florida victims ... because the NPA only covers Florida. 
We filed our reply brief on remedies on Tuesday — and that should have brought all briefing on remedies for the CVRA 
violation to a close. But yesterday Epstein's lawyer (Marty Weinberg) filed a motion for a sur-reply. See attached. In 
point (a) on page 2, he argues that he should have an opportunity to file a sur-reply discussing, among other things, 
the scope of the NPA. On Monday, we will be filing an opposition to Weinberg extending the briefing further. It 
appears that Judge Marra is poised to rule rapidly on the motion for a sur-reply, as he asked for us to respond quickly. 
I wanted to make you aware of these developments. My clients were told back in 2013 that the NPA did not extend to 
New York or other jurisdictions — and that is the point we are making to Judge Marra.

We discussed

Could you please start doing a workup on her? Attached is 
a message from

Good morning. I've reached out to the investigator. 
I also spoke again with the Paris prosecutor's office. Looks like they are going to send us an MLAT request. I will let you 
know when that comes in. 
Unrelatedly, OIA received the attached citizen correspondence, which I am forwarding to your attention in case there is 
anything here for your office or FBI.

I'm sorry - my colleagues remind me that this is inaccurate, defense counsel returned and/or destroyed 
discovery materials, pursuant to the protective order, following Epstein's suicide. So they won't be able to provide 
discovery materials. However, I believe they should separately have copies of the search warrant inventories which 
were of course provided separate from the protective order; if they don't, please let us know, and again we'll continue 
to try to figure out what if any obligations / restrictions we are subject to on the copies of inventory records that we

Marc, 
We're not yet exactly sure what our ability is to provide to the Trustees what is effectively discovery in a now-defunct 
criminal case against Epstein himself; that said, I can convey that we did produce to defense counsel detailed search 
warrant returns in connection with the New York property. Perhaps you would be able to obtain those from Epstein's 
criminal defense counsel? In particular I believe what you're looking for would be especially at USAO_4381-4445, but 
potentially also USAO_2662-4380 (though I note that a handful of those pages were marked as Confidential under a 
protective order, as set forth in the discovery letter sent to counsel on July 31, 2019). We will also review the status of 
the search warrant return with respect to the island property (and we have not searched the New Mexico property), and 
I hope this is useful in the interim. 
Separately, I've conveyed your request for a meeting to discuss the possibility of resolving the Government's potential 
forfeiture claims, and I haven't yet gotten a response to relay but will let you know as soon as I do (and will also provide 
these dates in connection with your request). 
thanks,

Subject: DOJ ongoing Investigation. 
Dear IM 
We and the Duke of York set out to assist your investigation when the DOJ asked for his help in January 2020. 
However, we regret to say that we have reached the conclusion that the DOJ's dealings with the Duke of York 
have not been designed to seek his assistance in investigating and prosecuting the targets of the investigation but 
instead have been used only to gather publicity for Mr Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States Attorney for the 
Southern District of New York. 
It is essential, if justice is to be done for Epstein's victims, that a proper and thorough criminal investigation is 
carried out. Although the public record indicates your office (SDNY) has been actively investigating Mr. Epstein 
and other targets for more than 2 years, the first time you ever attempted to make contact and request The Duke 
of York's help was on 2 January 2020. 
The Duke instructed my firm to make contact with you pertaining to this request. When we made contact, you 
confirmed that the Duke of York was not and is not a target of the US criminal investigation. 
EFTA00019885
--- PAGE 2 ---
Due to the publicity surrounding the investigation, we asked you to confirm that our discussions and any 
interview arrangements would remain confidential, in accordance with your rules. The Duke did not want to add 
to the media circus that has now surrounded the investigation. On 10 January 2020 you confirmed 
that any arrangements would indeed be kept confidential. 
We indicated that we would refer back to you once we had dealt with the various issues and procedures, which 
would need to be addressed to enable the Duke to cooperate to the fullest extent possible, including the need to 
obtain all the information that you might need to consider. It was at that time that we informed you, by email 
dated 20 January, that such preliminary issues would be dealt with within 14 days. It was also in that email that 
we confirmed that The Duke has a strong desire to cooperate with the ongoing investigation by the DOJ. 
Instead of waiting to hear from us (as you indicated on 22 January 2020), Mr Geoffrey S. Berman, the United 
States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, chose to make a public statement about the Duke on 27 
January 2020. This led to press reports that there had been "a wall of silence" and that there had been "zero co-
operation" by the Duke. These statements were not true. They should not have been made. 
Quite apart from your promise of confidentiality, in England it would not be thought to be in the interests of 
justice for any prosecutor or investigator to make public statements about witnesses who may be willing, in 
confidence, to assist their investigation. 
In England, prosecutors and investigators try to make sure that the investigation and trial of serious criminal 
cases take place in court and not in press conferences or publicity battles. 
When we complained about the way the Duke (and we) had been treated by the DOJ, you refused to 
apologise and you have now also gone back on your promise that any arrangements for the interview will be 
confidential. 
We cannot advise the Duke to speak to prosecutors who cannot be trusted to deal with him fairly nor to treat 
what he says or does confidentially. He has reluctantly accepted our advice that, in those circumstances, there is 
no purpose to be served in continuing to try to assist further. 
Finally we have no wish to engage in any further publicity battle about the DOJ's conduct and for that reason we 
ask that you treat this email as private and confidential.

Bailey and the TSC Suppressing Key Information to the FBI, PRA, and FCA Regarding the Jes 
Staley JP Morgan Emails 
Dear Mr Stride, 
I believe you should have an email from me sent to yourself in particular, and copied to members of 
the Treasury Select Committee on the 22nd of December 2019. I received a reply a month later from 
Maciej Wenerski who handled it as a FOIA, with the obligatory one month grace before hitting the 
send button. 
I shall not repeat myself too much here, but the issue is raised in the public domain now, with the FBI, 
FCA and the PRA all investigating Jes Staley's conduct while working at JP Morgan, which ostensibly 
should disqualify him from holding a sernior position in a bank — he was never fit to be CEO of 
Barclays. 
Clearly according the FOIA responses I received from the TSC, the blackmail emails from Epstein 
should have been enough to have had Staley dismissed in 2015, and would give substantial context to 
the emails held by JP Morgan. The TSC has had the Epstein emails now for almost five years — and 
no MP and no civil servant did the honourable thing and demand the FCA investigate. 
Mr Stride, do you take personal responsibility for the TSC witholding key legal evidence to ongoing 
inquiries? Which civil servants in the TSC are involved with the cover-up? Are they expecting a role in 
Barclays after the dust has settled? 
Andrew Bailey of the FCA and Lisa Osofsky of the SFO both explicity refused to investigate Staley 
after I supplied them with FOIA responses. Did the TSC order the FCA and the SFO to stand down? It 
is only the US press that has forced the British establishment's hand. Had Staley's role in JP Morgan 
not been reported there would be no investigation. 
I believe the general public would be correct to infer that Epstein not only blackmailed Parliament to 
put Staley into position, but blackmailed it into accepting Bailey and Osofsky. Both would need to be 
corrupted in order for Staley to keep his job. Why is Bailey being considered for top job at the Bank of 
England when the FCA that he runs has a 98% disapproval rating from the general public. 
Bailey and the FCA are answerable to the Treasury which is answerable to Parliament. 
It is noted that Andrew Bailey and Mark Carney are being investigated for the LC&F scandal. 
EFTA00019890
--- PAGE 3 ---
To remind you, my friend 
may well have been murdered for exposing the Epstein and 
Staley story back in 2017. The timing of her death and the contents of her exposé were given as 
evidence to Judge Worster of the Birmingham Court. The Court now refuses to accept my emails and 
he stonewalls me. Worster served two restraining orders against me. The effect of these orders is 
patent — they blocked the truth about Staley being publicly validated in a legal document and signed 
off by a High Court judge. They also allowed Deutsche Bank to get away with never having to file 
incriminating evidenec against themselves. 
Did Worster take a bribe or was he ordered by the TSC to gag me? I presume if Staley was going to 
bribe a judge to cover up his role in the Epstein paedophile circle, he would have to make sure the 
Lord Chief Justice Ian Burnett was in the loop. Lord Etherton seems to have implied Burnett was 
himself a paedphile. You may have heard about this. I wonder if Burnett was Epstein's pick? Certainly 
someone who works with both Lord Adrian PIE Fulford and Paul Kernaghan has to be highly suspect. I 
guess the truth must be in your email system somewhere. 
Did you bother asking the FCA to investigate Roger Jenkins, who also appears to have also gone to 
Epstein's child-rape parties? 
Yours sincerely 
Mark Anthony Taylor

Hello Aida, 
It was great seeing you as well. 
I have asked the appropriate staff to preserve the requested video footage. Please be advised MCC staff do not have 
body cameras. 
Thank you, 
>> > Aida Leisenring 
Hello M, 
7/25/2019 11:54 AM >> > 
It was good to see you yesterday. Thank you for accommodating my visit with Tartaglione and giving him extra time to 
review his discovery. We very much appreciate that. 
I am writing to request the preservation of all video surveillance that captures the hallway outside of Tartaglione's cell 
on the date and time of the Epstein incident that is currently being investigated. I believe that the date and time is July 
during the early morning hours. Accordingly, I would ask that all video surveillance from July 22 at 11 pm to July 23 
at 4 am is preserved. If it is your understanding that the incident occurred at a different time, please let me know and 
preserve the relevant footage, including an hour before the incident and an hour afterwards. If the responding officers 
were wearing body cameras that captured the inside of the cell in the aftermath of the incident, I am requesting that 
such footage also be preserved. 
We will be officially requesting this material through the appropriate means, but please consider this email a formal 
preservation request. 
Thank you.

We're not yet exactly sure what our ability is to provide to the Trustees what is effectively discovery in a now-defunct 
criminal case against Epstein himself; that said, I can convey that we did produce to defense counsel detailed search 
warrant returns in connection with the New York property. Perhaps you would be able to obtain those from Epstein's 
criminal defense counsel? In particular I believe what you're looking for would be especially at USAO_4381-4445, but 
potentially also USAO_2662-4380 (though I note that a handful of those pages were marked as Confidential under a 
protective order, as set forth in the discovery letter sent to counsel on July 31, 2019). We will also review the status of the 
search warrant return with respect to the island property (and we have not searched the New Mexico property), and I 
hope this is useful in the interim. 
Separately, I've conveyed your request for a meeting to discuss the possibility of resolving the Government's potential 
forfeiture claims, and I haven't yet gotten a response to relay but will let you know as soon as I do (and will also provide 
these dates in connection with your request). 
thanks, 
Alex.

Jeff, 
Following up on our phone conversation today, I wanted to memorialize that, as discussed, we do not currently have 
reason to believe Ms. 
has criminal exposure based on what we are aware of in connection with her interactions 
with Jeffrey Epstein, and your brief attorney proffer regarding the circumstances of those interactions are consistent with 
that view. In your further discussions with Ms. 
in advance of a further attorney proffer to address the general 
EFTA00019908

nature of her relationship with Mr. Epstein, as well as his employees or relevant close associates, if you have any concerns 
about additional possible exposure you should please feel free to be in touch with us again. As we also discussed, I 
believe any non-federal offenses would be well outside the relevant statute(s) of limitation, but of course if you wish to 
further research that issue, or consult with criminal counsel, we defer to you entirely. 
Please let us know if any other information would be useful at this stage, and hopefully we can be in touch in the coming 
weeks about productive next steps. 
thank you,

prep 
• 
Discussed schedule for trial prep, mechanics of trial testimony. USAO will pay for 
to fly up to NY for trial, with her husband and children as support. 
• 
Since last meeting in January 2021, 
received $3.5 million award from the Victim 
Compensation Fund run by Epstein's estate. Several hundred thousand dollars of that 
amount was taken out, and 
ultimately received over $2 million. • 
used the money 
to buy a new home for her family, a car, to pay off fines to get her license back, and to set 
man account for her children. 
• 
has had trouble sleeping over the past few months because she has dreams about 
Epstein and is nervous about testifying at trial. U continues to speak with her counselor 
every day and is prescribed medications to help with her mental health and addiction. 
• 
• 
believes she lied to 
about her age when they were dating. She 
believes she told 
that she was 17 years old when she was really younger. [NOTE: 
was not feeling physically well during this interview, so no follow up questions were 
asked about this topic during this meeting. AUSA arranged to meet with 
later in the 
week when U will hopefully be feeling better.]

ust learned from Probation that Efrain Reyes died. It sounds like it was in his sleep. Given his history, I 
think it may have been drug related, but perhaps not. Either way, my recollection is that you didn't expect to need him for 
anything Epstein/MCC-related, but just want to keep you in the loop in case my memory is wrong.

Date: Thu, 17 Jun 2021 18:20:49 +0000 
Good afternoon-
Earlier this week, around 1:00 am 
guards purposely awoke Ms. Maxwell because they observed her body shaking 
and were concerned that she was having a seizure. 
They determined she was shivering from the extremely cold temperature in her cell. 
At approximately 3:00 am the following day, the guards again disrupted Ms. Maxwell's sleep 
because her body was shaking. Again, they determined that she was 
shivering and gave her a blanket. 
The guards have now removed two of her blankets, claiming the blankets 
are not authorized. Today, Ms. Maxwell awoke cold and headachy 
with a sore throat. When medical staff came by she was too exhausted 
to address her physical discomfort. 
Please explain why guards purposely disrupt Ms. Maxwell's 
sleep, determine she is shivering, and then remove blankets-
her only source of warmth. This makes no sense, is detrimental 
her health, and is utterly insensitive. 
In addition, VTC viewing is less blurry on counsel's end but the image repeatedlybecomes broken 
and then completely blacks out. 
This is disrupting attorney-client communication, the ability to prepare for trial, and is negatively impacting 
counsel's vision and concentration. 
Please address and remedy this problems immediately.

Good afternoon-
Despite being subjected to the most unique, restrictive, and invasive conditions 
of pretrial confinement, Ms. Maxwell has and continues to be a compliant detainee. 
She obeys all orders and commands - often muffled by masks, 
uttered behind prison doors, and/or combined with the din of background noise -
as soon as they are audibly discernible. 
Erratic enforcement of inconsistent rules and regulations imposed by 
revolving teams of guards who exert varying degrees of officiousness 
and contempt toward Ms. Maxwell is the fault of the MDC/BOP, 
not Ms. Maxwell.

Hi Bobbi-
I apologize for the delay in response. I have been out of office sick. 
We are looking into the concerns you have brought to our attention

EFTA00019934
--- PAGE 3 ---
regarding the VTC units. All of the VTC units throughout the 
institution are now being stored in this manner as it is a protective 
barrier for the equipment. With that said, we will be doing test runs 
to investigate concerns you have mentioned. 
Furthermore, Ms. Maxwell must oblige by the orders of the Officers. We 
offer Ms. Maxwell medical care on a daily basis, which she has 
declined. 
Additionally, can you please provide me with a photo of the ear buds 
you are requesting to bring into the institution? 
Best, 
BOBBI C STERNHEIM <

Good morning-
As reported yesterday, the modifications made in the VTC room 
are negatively impacting attorney-client communication. 
The video is blurry; the audio includes distorting noises. 
I am requesting that these problems be remedied immediately. 
Also, I am bringing to your attention the inappropriate behavior of the 
guards presently on Ms. Maxwell's detail: threatening discipline if 
Ms. Maxwell is "off camera" while leaning against a wall to soothe her 
aching 
back; barking orders regarding the noise emanating from the washing 
machine 
and the pace of her gait when walking; laughing amongst themselves as 
if any of this is funny. 
The manner in which some of the guards responded to me on Sunday gives 
me reason to be concerned 
about how they treat Ms. Maxwell when out of public view. 
The courtesy of a response is requested. 
Thank you-

Good afternoon, 
It was a pleasure to meet you yesterday. In light of the recent filing and media reports, 
wanted me to clarify 
her compensation with you. Aside from her regular salary, she did receive payments from Epstein in 2004 (to cover 
gym membership and English classes), as well as a lump sum payment of cash during 2005 (less than $10k). Epstein 
also paid for meals, salon appointments, clothing, etc. while she was working for him in 2005. You will not find any 
lump sum payments made once she terminated her employment. 
As always, feel free to contact me at any time if we can be of further assistance. Look forward to meeting again.

We were certainly saddened to see the news this morning, as I know all of you were. I appreciate that you have more 
pressing issues to deal with at the moment, but we are interested in whether you expect any aspect of the SDNY's 
investigation/case to continue, potentially a separate civil forfeiture proceeding, or possible criminal prosecutions against 
other defendants. We also understand that you may not be in a position to tell us anything at the moment, which is fine. 
Just anticipating and preparing for questions we expect to be asked. Separately, having had the experience of a defendant 
in a case I charged commit suicide, I wanted to add that it can be a complicated feeling, and to the extent it is helpful, I 
think you brought a really important case and conducted yourselves in a professional, compassionate and impressive way. 
So despite sad news, and frustrating news after putting so much work into filing a case and preparing to see it through, 
heads should be held high. 
Best,

All, 
Sony to see the sad news about Epstein. I'm sure you're shaken. 
and I went through a similar 
suicide three years ago with a securities fraud defendant. If you need anything, we're here for you. You were 
doing you're job and obviously no one wishes harm to come to anyone.

Following up on my conversations with Mike and Marty this morning, and my discussion with Mike moments 
ago, attached is a press release just sent to us (and I believe also issued publicly) some minutes ago. It represents 
all the information we have from BOP so far, but of course if we are successful in our continuing efforts to get 
additional information we will pass it along immediately. 
Separately, we can tell you that the reports that an FBI investigation into the death has been initiated are

I just tried calling, but I realize it's very late — moments ago I spoke with an individual at the Office of the 
Chief Medical Examiner, Dr. Jason Graham. He said his office was in touch with the family today — I believe 
Mark — and he had the understanding a pathologist was lined up for tomorrow, but based in the newer 
understanding that you conveyed, that more time is needed, they are prepared to delay tomorrow the autopsy 
(which was otherwise planned for tomorrow morning). Hey conveyed that permitting a pathologist is a 
courtesy they extend in this type of situation, and that an additional day or two will not have an effect in their 
ability to evaluate the cause and manner of death. 
Accordingly, he asked that you please contact him tonight or tomorrow morning to arrange logistics of the 
pathologist who ultimately will join; Dr. Graham's e-mail is: 
As of tonight, my understanding is that he has instructed his staff not to proceed tomorrow morning, pending 
being in touch with you for further coordination. 
Please let me know if there are any issues being in contact with him, and also feel free to contact me generally 
if that would be helpful.

Thanks for being available today and for getting the wheels turning for an investigation into how he died. 
On a related note, we are hearing that Jeffrey's autopsy may occur tomorrow morning. We would like to 
have a pathologist present for his autopsy and cannot line up someone on such short notice. Is there any 
way to push the autopsy off until Tuesday to give us time to do that?

Following up on the below, wanted to make sure the attached letter from the Warden immediately got to Mike as well 
(in addition to Marty and Reid having been copied and emailed). As the letter indicates, there are now investigations 
ongoing, including as initiated by the Attorney General himself. Separately, we have not received additional 
information on topics such as the apparent cause of death, the status of observation of Mr. Epstein at the time, etc., 
but we will continue to be in touch immediately if that changes.

 r • 
>, 
Mike, 
I know we just spoke but I wanted to memorialize the information for everyone in one place — regarding your question 
about the "a' 
(phonetic) who called an individual associated with Mr. Epstein regarding next steps for 
recovery of Mr. Epstein's body, we confirmed with BOP that the call was not a hoax; Mr. 
does work for BOP / MCC 
and his contact number is in fact 
The slight divergence of the BOP account from your understanding is that BOP advised us that Mr. 
had contacted 
Mr. Epstein's brother to advise that when the body is ready, part of BOP's responsibility is to arrange for its transport (and 
possibly other notifications or logistics for next-of-kin). They were not trying to convey that the body is ready now; rather, 
they expect it will be some time until that is the case, but they wanted to contact next-of-kin immediately. So you and/or 
Mr. Epstein's brother should feel free to be in touch with BOP at that number if and when that would be useful. 
Separately, it is in process for us to determine whether we are able to provide a contact name and number for the new 
investigation(s), but in the interim, as we discussed, you should feel free to refer any individuals to the FBI tip line, which 
will continue to do intake on all Epstein-related matters including the new investigation; that number is 1-800-CALL-FBI. 
Finally, attached is a statement put out by our office this afternoon, so you have it directly. Given the active investigation 
into the circumstances of Mr. Epstein's death, I think it is possible we will not receive additional substantive information in 
the immediate future (or that if we do, it will be information we're not permitted to share outside our Office because of 
the nature of the investigation), but we will continue to convey any substantive information that we can. 
thank you,

Thanks, 
What day did the facilities manager talk to him / test run the shower? 
Assistant U.S. Attorney

On Aug 21, 2019, at 08:56, 
Hi 
Just a couple updates: 
wrote: 
I caught one of the officers who normally does SHU rec. He confirmed that Tartaglione can go to the roof for 
recreation. SHU rec is normally from about 6:00/6:30 to 10:30/11:00. The officer said Tartaglione is usually 
sleeping, and once he eventually wakes up, he never asks them to go. The officer said when Tartaglione and 
Epstein were housed together, Epstein asked about rec. The officer told Epstein he would take him at 6:00 AM 
before his attorneys showed up. Tartaglione was in the cell during this conversation, and the officer told me 
made a comment like "I can take you up together" to both of them. 
The Facilities Manager told me they talked to Tartaglione. He had no complaints about his cell. He only 
complained that water leaked in his cell when people "took long showers." Facilities ran the shower for awhile 
and didn't see the water leaking down to Tartaglione's cell, but if I give Tartaglione the benefit of the doubt, he 
may be correct that the water makes its way down there eventually after it's been running for a long, long time. 
Evening watch SHU staff confirmed they gave Tartaglione the three newspapers that arrived in the mail 
yesterday morning. 
I think that's it for now. Let me know if you need anything else. 
Thanks!

(Case called) 
THE COURT: Good morning, everybody. Please be 
seated. 
So just some housekeeping. We have a podium here for 
both attorneys and others who may be speaking, and so we would 
like you, attorneys and others who are speaking, to come up to 
the podium. This room is a little cavernous. We thought the 
podium over there would be more comfortable. 
For starters, and for this you don't have to go up to 
the podium, if you could just indicate your names. This table 
in front to my left, your right, are defense counsel, and that 
table to my right, your left, are government attorneys. 
If we could just ask the attorneys to introduce 
themselves.

defendant. 
THE COURT: Great. 
Again, good morning to all of you. This hearing that 
we're having today considers the government's motion to dismiss 
the indictment in this case. 
I must add that it also serves as the opportunity for 
me to thank all of you, the attorneys and the victims who are 
here today, among others, for your very hard work and 
dedication in this case. 
We also have here today the U.S. Attorney for the 
Southern District of New York, Geoffrey Berman, who has also 
been very helpful and indispensable in this matter. 
The news on August 10, 2019, that Jeffrey Epstein had 
been found dead in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional 
Center, at the MCC, was certainly shocking. Most of you, and 
myself for that matter, were anticipating that the next steps 
in this case would be defense motion practice, including a 
motion to dismiss, followed by a trial on the merits before a 
jury, if the motions were not successful, and through which the 
accusers and the accused would come face to face, allowing 
everyone to get their day in court. Mr. Epstein's death 
obviously means that a trial in which he is a defendant cannot 
take place. It is a rather stunning turn of events. 
The government's motion to dismiss the indictment 
because of Jeffrey Epstein's death on August 10, 2019, is 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
(212) 805-0300 
EFTA00019996
--- PAGE 4 ---
JaRsEPS1 
relatively straightforward. In my view, a public hearing 
clearly is nevertheless the preferred vehicle for its 
resolution. 
Incidentally, while I'm on this subject, I got some 
help today from the New York Law Journal from two professors 
who write that a hearing is -- let me tell you exactly what 
they said. They say, in part, that this is an odd moment for 
transparency in a criminal case. I think that is an odd 
sentence to hear about, transparency in a criminal case. 
They go on to say that normally, if a prosecutor seeks 
to dismiss an indictment for such an obviously worthy reason, 
the court would simply grant the request. As to that 
statement, I respectfully say it is incorrect as a matter of 
law. 
They go on to say the judge would not schedule a 
hearing and he definitely would not allow the victims to speak. 
If he did hold a hearing, whatever informational interests the 
victims may have would be served by affording them a chance to 
attend the hearing, not by giving them a speaking role. 
I read it. It was incredulous. I'm still 
incredulous. I don't quite understand at all. There is a 
suggestion in the article that the reason they are making these 
suggestions has to do with minimization of drama in this case. 
In the Jeffrey Epstein case, there has not been much a 
minimization of drama, and what little drama might happen

today, I don't think it would be very significant. 
On a somewhat more serious note, don't quote me on 
this, but it is my understanding that one of the authors of 
that article is himself counsel in one of the Epstein-related 
cases. I was surprised to learn that very recently. I'm 
certain it is true. I was also surprised that that aspect was 
not disclosed in the Law Journal. 
But in any event, I think you know where I'm heading. 
I respectfully disagree with the Law Journal piece. I was 
saying that the government's motion is relatively 
straightforward, and in my view, a public hearing is clearly, 
nevertheless, the preferred vehicle for its resolution. I'm 
still convinced of that. 
A few may differ on this, but public hearings are 
exactly what judges do. Hearings promote transparency and they 
provide the court with insights and information which the court 
may not otherwise be aware of. 
The victims have been included in the proceeding today 
both because of their relevant experiences and because they 
should always be involved before rather than after the fact. 
Indictment 19 CR 490 charges Jeffrey Epstein with sex 
trafficking and with conspiracy to commit sex trafficking. The 
U.S. Attorney, on August 19, 2019, requested that the court 
approve the government's proposed order of nolle prosequi. 
think that's a rough justice. That means nolle prosequi, 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

EFTA00019998

J8RsEPS1 
discontinuance by the prosecutor of all or of a part of the 
case that he or she has commenced. 
The government in its motion concludes that Epstein's 
death abates these proceedings. In accordance with Federal 
Rule of Criminal Procedure 57(b), I determined to hold a public 
hearing and I notified the victims that they would be given the 
opportunity to be heard before any final action on the motion. 
That is the purpose also of today's proceeding. I would do 
that every time. 
Also, recognized that Epstein, Mr. Epstein died before 
any judgment of conviction against him had been obtained, and 
that the government's proposed order appears, in form and 
substance, to be appropriate. 
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 48(a) codifies the 
nolle prosequi process. It is entitled dismissal, and it 
states in relevant part that the government may, with leave of 
the court, dismiss an indictment, information, or complaint, 
and that leave of the court proviso, you should know, was added 
as an amendment to the original draft of Rule 48, which had 
originally provided for automatic dismissal upon the motion of 
the government. 
This proviso, in my judgment, is clearly directed 
toward an independent judicial assessment of the public 
interest in dismissing the indictment. Thus, even whereas, in 
this case, the standard of court review is deferential, the 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
(212) 805-0300 
EFTA00019999
--- PAGE 7 ---
J8RsEPS1 
court must still make its own independent determination. A 
conclusory statement from the government that dismissal is 
appropriate does not satisfy the court's obligations. 
It is also, in my view, required that the court 
consider the views of the victims in the case at the hearing 
and before deciding whether to grant the motion. This is being 
done here both as a matter of law and as a measure of respect 
that we have for the victims' difficult decisions to come 
forward in this matter. 
In a case called United States v. Heaton, 
H-e-a-t-o-n-, the government filed a Rule 48 motion for leave 
to dismiss a charge against a defendant who allegedly committed 
a sexual offense against a young victim. Although I should 
point out, very importantly, that that defendant was still 
alive, which distinguishes it from our case. 
Nevertheless, I think it is irrelevant because in 
evaluating the Rule 48 motion, then district Judge Paul G. 
Cassell -- who is now a law professor at the University of Utah 
and is regarded to be a noted expert in victims' rights --
concluded that under the Crime Victims' Rights Act, victims 
have broad rights that extend to a court's decision whether to 
grant a government motion to dismiss under Rule 48. 
I completely share that viewpoint in these 
circumstances, even though the facts of our case, as I said, 
are somewhat different from those in Heaton. 
I believe it is 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
(212) 805-0300 
EFTA00020000
--- PAGE 8 ---
J8RsEPS1 
the court's responsibility, and manifestly within its purview, 
to ensure that the victims in this case are treated fairly and 
with dignity. 
The fundamental substantive principle which applies in 
considering the government's motion is termed the rule of 
abatement. This principle originated in the English common 
law. It was adopted by most U.S. federal courts, but more 
recently, it has faced some appropriate criticism. The rule of 
abatement is best explained in the Second Circuit case of 
U.S. v. Wright. 
In that Wright case, two defendants had pled guilty to 
embezzlement and tax evasion. Both defendants appealed, but 
one of the defendants died while his appeal was pending in the 
Second Circuit. The Court of Appeals rule that under the rule 
of abatement, the judgment of conviction against the deceased 
defendant was required to be vacated and the indictment was to 
be dismissed. The Wright court held that when a convicted 
defendant dies while his direct appeal as of right is pending, 
his death abates not only the appeal, but also proceedings had 
during the course of the prosecution. 
The Second Circuit incidentally has also held that 
when a criminal conviction abates upon the death of a 
defendant, any restitution ordered as a result of that 
conviction must also abate, and it is also ruled the same with 
respect to associated forfeiture orders. 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
(212) 805-0300 
EFTA00020001
--- PAGE 9 ---
J8RsEPS1 
This latter application of the rule of abatement 
regarding forfeiture has not been universally accepted among 
federal courts, but it certainly is the law in this circuit. 
Some of you may be interested to know that some United States 
courts, state courts, have criticized the rule of abatement, 
particularly in the face of growing recognition of victims' 
rights in the criminal justice system, including the Crime 
Victims' Rights Act. 
It has been written and contended in the Brooklyn Law 
Review -- I can give you the cite later -- that when courts 
abate criminal convictions, they reimpose a burden on victims 
that legislatures intended to alleviate through these victim 
rights statutes. The state Supreme Court has even concluded 
that the expansion and codification of victims' rights provides 
the changed conditions needed for overruling the rule of 
abatement. It has also been stated that Alaska's statute and 
its constitution now require the criminal justice system to 
accommodate the rights of crime victims. Further, that the 
abatement of criminal convictions has important implications 
for these rights. 
But coming back to our case, which is what you are 
concerned about and I am as well, it is appropriate to conclude 
that if the rule of abatement applies to a convicted defendant 
as in the Wright case, it should also apply a fortiori in the 
Epstein case, which was still in the pretrial phase when 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

J8RsEPS1 
Mr. Epstein died, when there had been no conviction. 
So that's just some background I wanted to share with 
you. At this point in time, I would like to turn to the 
government prosecutors to hear from them in support of their 
Rule 48 application to dismiss the Epstein indictment. 
MS. 
: Thank you, your Honor. 
Would you like me to address the court from the 
podium? 
THE COURT: If you wouldn't mind. 
MS. 
: Thank you, your Honor. 
I believe your Honor has accurately summarized the 
state of the law, as set forth in our papers, in light of the 
clear Second Circuit law, that upon the death of a defendant 
before a final entry of a judgment of conviction, all 
proceedings must be abated. 
In light of that clear law, the government is legally 
obligated to seek dismissal of the pending indictment against 
Jeffrey Epstein, and we respectfully submit, likewise, that the 
entry of the proposed order is similarly required by law. 
A few notes to make about that, though, your Honor. 
To be very clear, dismissal of this indictment as to Jeffrey 
Epstein in no way prohibits or inhibits the government's 
ongoing investigation into other potential coconspirators, nor 
does it prevent the bringing of a new case in the future or the 
prosecution of new defendants. 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
(212) 805-0300 
EFTA00020003
--- PAGE 11 ---
J8RsEPS1 
It also does nothing to prevent the government from 
continuing to explore the possibility of seeking civil 
forfeiture of any assets that were used to facilitate the 
crimes charged in this indictment. Indeed, as has been stated 
publicly, investigations into those matters have been ongoing, 
remain ongoing, and will continue following dismissal of the 
indictment here. 
I would also like to note that, as the government has 
previously mentioned, this dismissal in no way lessens the 
government's resolve to stand up for the victims in this case, 
both those who have come forward and those who have yet to do 
so. We agree with your Honor's sentiment that those victims 
should be respected, and we appreciate your Honor's recognition 
of that. 
One housekeeping matter that I did want to reference 
for your Honor. The protective order in this case requires 
destruction or return of any and all discovery material upon 
conclusion of the case. We have been in communication with 
defense counsel, who have confirmed that they have returned all 
physical copies that they have of discovery that the government 
has produced to date, and they are in the process of deleting 
any copies that they may have made. So the parties are in 
compliance with the protective order. 
Finally, I just wanted to say a word about the victims 
in this case, and particularly those who are here in court 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
(212) 805-0300 
EFTA00020004
--- PAGE 12 ---
J8RsEPS1 
today. I'll note that in light of the court's order indicating 
that the victims and their counsel would be permitted to be 
heard in court here today, the government has endeavored to 
provide notice to all known victims of today's proceeding. We 
did so either directly where a victim was not represented by 
counsel or through counsel where a victim is represented by an 
attorney. 
The government does not know exactly how many victims 
or their attorneys are here today and we do not know how many 
of them or their counsel would like to speak. To the extent 
any individuals do wish to speak, we do not know the substance 
of what they would like to say. We have left that entirely up 
to the individual decisions of the victims and their attorneys. 
I will note, though, that throughout this case, the 
government has endeavored and done our utmost to fulfill our 
obligations under the Crimes Victims' Rights Act. We have done 
so by trying to keep as many victims as we are aware of up to 
date about the ongoing case and about any developments in the 
case. 
We will continue to provide services and offer 
services to any of the victims in this case, even after the 
indictment is dismissed. Both the U.S. Attorney's office and 
the FBI have been in touch with all known victims or have 
attempted to be in touch with all known victims, either again 
directly where victims are not represented by counsel or 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
(212) 805-0300 
EFTA00020005
--- PAGE 13 ---
J8RsEPS1 
through counsel where they have attorneys. We have expressed 
to them that services are available for those who wish to take 
advantage of them. 
Unless the court has any questions for me, the 
government will otherwise rest on its papers. 
THE COURT: I just have one question. 
The protective order, is that self-executing or do 1 
need to do something? 
MS. 
: It is self-executing, your Honor. 
THE COURT: Thanks very much, Ms. 
MS. 
: Thank you, your Honor. 
THE COURT: Yes. 
I'll turn to counsel for the defense at this time. 
Mr. Weingarten, I'm happy to hear from you. 
MR. WEINGARTEN: Thank you. 
Your Honor, I think it is an understatement of the 
year to say the world looks and feels differently today than it 
did the last time I was before you. For us, the elephant in 
the room is what happened to our client. I would like to tell 
you how we see the world and where we are on that subject. 
We start with the Attorney General's statements, 
public statements, that there were very serious improprieties 
in the jail. We obviously read the press. We see that the 
warden has been taken out. We see that the guards on duty at 
the time have been put on leave. We understand guards are 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
(212) 805-0300 
EFTA00020006
--- PAGE 14 ---
J8RsEPS1 
refusing to cooperate with the investigation. We have heard 
allegations that people at the time who had responsibility for 
protecting our client falsified information. We understand 
that there were orders out there that Jeffrey Epstein was never 
to be left alone and that the orders were ignored by many of 
the employees of the prison. 
In a word, yikes. In addition, obviously we followed 
the medical examiner's report, or we haven't followed the 
report, we haven't seen it, but heard conclusions, initially 
not enough evidence to come to a conclusion, wanted to see 
more. We assumed she was talking about the videotapes, but 
then came to the conclusion that it was suicide. 
We report to the court that --
THE COURT: Suicide by hanging --
MR. WEINGARTEN: Yes. 
THE COURT: -- was her conclusion? 
MR. WEINGARTEN: Yes. 
And we report to the court that we had a doctor there 
at the time, and we also have been in receipt of a tremendous 
amount of medical and scientific evidence volunteered to us 
opining that the injuries suffered, as reported, were far more 
consistent with assault than with suicide, and we are happy to 
supply the court with all the information that we have. 
Now, in addition, as the court noted, we were underway 
with our pretrial motions, and as the court obviously 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
(212) 805-0300 
EFTA00020007
--- PAGE 15 ---
J8RsEPS1 
understands, the NPA and the role of the NPA was going to be 
critically important. And I would simply like to report that 
we went pretty far along. 
We interviewed all of the relevant lawyers on the 
defense side who participated in the NPA, and we were satisfied 
that we had a very strong argument that every one of those 
lawyers believed with an objective basis that the deal was 
global. That is, at the time --
THE COURT: I'm sorry, that? 
MR. WEINGARTEN: The deal of the NPA was global. That 
is, more specifically, at the time, 
agents knew of conduct in New York, 
defense counsel negotiating in good 
the Florida prosecutors and 
and that no competent 
faith with the prosecutors 
would have ever agreed to a deal back then that allowed New 
York prosecutors to indict for precisely the same conduct in 
the future, which, of course, is what happened. 
In addition, we have come up with very powerful 
evidence, we believe, that Florida prosecutors, who 
participated in the deal, steered the victims and the alleged 
victims to New York on more than one occasion because they did 
not want to suffer the sleights of attacks against them. So we 
have advanced the ball on this very subject and we are prepared 
to completely report to the court as to where we are and what 
we've done. 
Another point. We obviously had contact with our 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
(212) 805-0300

J8RsEPS1 
client at or around the time of his death, and obviously the 
attorney-client privilege survives death and we are not going 
to forfeit the privilege, but we will report to the court, with 
as much specificity as the court may want, that at or around 
the time of his death, we did not see a 
suicidal person. Details to follow, if 
The 800-pound gorilla, for us, 
despairing, despondent 
the court wishes. 
of course, are the 
video surveillance tapes. Obviously we assume there is a tape 
that leads directly to the door where Jeffrey Epstein was 
housed. If that tape reports for 12 hours before his death 
that no one went in and out of that room, then the suggestion 
that there was something other than a suicide seems 
preposterous. 
But there is no such evidence that has surfaced to 
date. Just the opposite. We have heard, and we actually read 
in the press, that the tapes were either corrupted or not 
functioning. Talk about a yikes. If, in fact, the system was 
broken for six months before Jeffrey Epstein was housed, I 
mean, that would be stunning incompetence. If it was allowed 
to continue to be inoperative when Jeffrey Epstein was housed, 
it would be incompetence times ten. But what if the tapes only 
broke down or were inoperative or were corrupted on the day he 
was killed or the day he died? Then we're in a completely 
different situation. 
So where does this lead? I think where it leads, 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

Judge, is there are incredibly important questions that remain 
open. The public interest in this matter is obvious from this 
courtroom. There are conspiracy theories galore. We are all 
for finding the truth. We believe this court has an 
indispensable role to play. 
Whether or not this indictment is dismissed, I think 
this court has the inherent authority to find out what happened 
on its watch. Obviously, when the court detained Jeffrey 
Epstein, the court did not anticipate that weeks later he would 
be dead in his cell. I think given the inherent authority of 
the court, the court should make inquiry. 
This could come in many forms. Obviously the court 
made inquiry as to what happened in the first incident. When 
there was an allegation of an attempted suicide, the court made 
inquiry. The court obviously was interested. 
I recall your language. You talked about that being 
one of the several open questions indicating an interest on the 
court for the others as well. Obviously, the ultimate question 
is what happened to the client. 
THE COURT: You're talking about the July 23, 2019 
incident? 
MR. WEINGARTEN: Yes. 
The court obviously could hold hearings. The court 
could assign a lawyer to help the court. I think this is an 
area where there is intense public interest. We have complete

confidence in the prosecutors in the Southern District and the 
FBI to do a competent investigation. But these are allegations 
against serious components of the United States Department of 
Justice. Sometimes the appearance of justice is just as 
important as justice itself. 
I think the court supervising, or at least keeping an 
interest in this proceeding, is incredibly important for the 
public to have confidence in the ultimate findings, and 
certainly for us to have confidence in the ultimate findings. 
One more issue, Judge. The conditions of the jail, in 
a word, they were dreadful. Not just for Jeffrey Epstein, but 
for many of the prisoners over there. This is a prison within 
the shadows of this courthouse. The situation is rife with 
vermin. The abuse and the conditions in that prison, in 
word, are a disgrace and everybody knows it. 
A person with authority told us, someone with 
knowledge, that the prisoners in Guantanamo -- and he spoke 
with personal knowledge -- are treated better than the 
prisoners right across the way. The feds certainly know how 
run a disciplined, clean prison. I've been in 20 of them. 
They know how to do it just fine. And the question is, why in 
the world does it not happen down the road? I think that is a 
perfectly legitimate subject for the court to make inquiry. 
In a word, we want the court to help us find out what 
happened. The court has a role to play. It is the institution 
a

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

that most people have confidence in in these very troubled 
times. 
So whether or not you dismiss the indictment, to us, 
is beside the point. We want you to stay on the case, we want 
you to conduct an investigation, and we want to know what 
happened here. 
Thank you, your Honor. 
THE COURT: Just so it is clear, so your view on the 
motion directly on its merits of the nolle prosequi order and 
application by the U.S. Attorney, do you have a view on that? 
MR. WEINGARTEN: I think if the court felt that the 
case had to stay alive for the court to continue, we would 
oppose it. I think --
THE COURT: I'm sorry, if what? 
MR. WEINGARTEN: If the issue, if you took the 
position for you to conduct the investigation or lead the 
investigation or participate in the investigation, then we 
want, the role we want you to play, if the indictment has to be 
alive, we would oppose the motion. 
I don't think you need to do that. I think you can 
dismiss the indictment. 
THE COURT: So you're suggesting that you support the 
government's motion, just viewed in the context of --
MR. WEINGARTEN: Yes, of course. 
THE COURT: Great.

MR. WEINBERG: Judge, if I can just supplement? 
THE COURT: Absolutely. 
MR. WEINBERG: Thank you, sir. 
Thank you, as an out-of-town lawyer for the privilege 
to appear in front of you, your Honor. 
THE COURT: It's my pleasure. 
MR. WEINBERG: First, as to the conditions, we think 
your Honor trusted the government, the Bureau of Prisons, to 
keep our client safe and keep him in civilized conditions. The 
government will again ask, as to other defendants, that they be 
detained at the MCC, some subset of them will end up in the SHU 
unit. 
It is a horrific. I've called it medieval. There's 
vermin on the floor. There is wet from the plumbing. There is 
no sunlight. There is limited exercise. It is simply 
conditions that no pretrial detainee -- and I would go farther 
as a criminal defense lawyer -- no United States defendant 
should be subjected to. 
Certain judges have taken views of the conditions. We 
would urge your Honor, the government talks about and we talk 
about transparency, to see what kind of conditions there exist 
within 50 or 100 yards of one of the great United States 
district courts. 
Second, in terms, we have a profound problem with the 
conclusions of the medical examiner. There are for three 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
(212) 805-0300 
EFTA00020013

J8RsEPS1 
reasons, your Honor. 
One is the timing of Mr. Epstein's demise. It was on 
August 10. On August 12, a bail pending appeal motion was 
being filed in the Second Circuit. On August 12 or 13, the 
United States Attorneys were going to respond to our request 
for the preservation and production of documents that would 
have facilitated and furthered our efforts to demonstrate 
communications between the Southern District of Florida, the 
Northern District of Georgia, which was standing in the shoes 
of the Southern District of Florida main justice and the 
Southern District. 
In other words, we were beginning the process 
discharging our responsibilities. There had been no new 
evidence that Mr. Epstein had committed any offense against a 
minor after 2005. The subject matter of the New York 
prosecution was squarely within the heartland of the Florida 
NPA. We had a significant motion to dismiss. This was not a 
futile, you know, defeatist attitude. 
Third, we had all the discovery motions that your 
Honor had scheduled. So the timing for a pretrial detainee to 
commit suicide on August 10, when his bail pending appeal 
motion is being filed on August 12, strikes us as implausible. 
Second, we had an independent doctor who was present 
at the autopsy which occurred on August 11. On August 11, the 
city medical examiner's findings were inconclusive. We are 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
(212) 805-0300 
EFTA00020014
--- PAGE 22 ---
J8RsEPS1 
told by a very experienced forensic pathologist that the broken 
bones in Mr. Epstein's neck, in his larynx, are more consistent 
with external pressure, with strangulation, with homicide, if 
you will, than with suicide. It doesn't exclude suicide, but 
the pure medical forensic evidence creates profound issues 
about what happened to him. 
Also the time of death. Our medical examiner's 
opinion is it occurred at least 45 minutes and probably hours 
before 6:30 a.m. on August 10, when he was first found, if you 
will, according to the reports. Yet he was moved, something 
that is not ordinary in these circumstances. 
I would also --
THE COURT: Excuse me. He was moved? 
MR. WEINBERG: Instead of having the cell in the 
condition it was found, if he had been dead for 45 minutes or 
two hours or four hours, there were efforts to move him and, 
therefore, make it more difficult to reconstruct whether or not 
he died of suicide or some other cause. 
I spoke to Stacey Richmond, who is a responsible 
member of this court who represents the family of Mr. Epstein. 
She spoke to the medical examiner on the Friday after 
Mr. Epstein's death and asked why, if the conclusion was made 
late in the afternoon on Friday that week. She specifically 
asked about what extrinsic nonmedical evidence caused the 
medical examiner to go from uncertain to suicide, and she was 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
(212) 805-0300 
EFTA00020015
--- PAGE 23 ---
J8RsEPS1 
told that the medical examiner had seen nine minutes of one 
video which was on a stairwell between floors at the MCC. She 
was told that the principal video that would have showed the 
whole hall was corrupted. It was in DC with the FBI to see if 
they can reconstruct it. 
And I asked the same questions that my co-counsel did, 
you know, was the dysfunction of the critical pivotal video, in 
the most secure prison east of Florence, out in Colorado known 
to the MCC before August 10, or was this corruption occurring 
on August 10, which would again cause us to be skeptical of the 
servitude of the medical examiner's conclusions that this was 
suicide rather than some other cause. 
So with my co-counsel, we ask your Honor, it is not a 
question of trust or not trust. They ask you to detain people 
and you trust the Bureau of Prisons. And it is within your 
inherit authority, your Honor, to find out what happened to our 
client. 
We are angry about the conditions he was held in. And 
we're also angry, quite frankly, your Honor, that the only 
source of information that we get as to what happened to him is 
through the media rather than through the United States 
Attorney's office. We've made requests informal. We have 
made Touhy requests. We've been told there is a pending 
investigation. 
But we trust your Honor and the judiciary, and with 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

J8RsEPS1 
all due respect, we believe there is an inherent and central 
role, a pivotal role in your Honor to find out what happened to 
a defendant in a case before the court, whether or not the 
court grants the nolle pros today or whether it holds it 
pending an investigation into Mr. Epstein's death. 
We're not here without significant doubts regarding 
the conclusion of suicide. We are not here to say what 
happened. We don't know what happened. But we deeply want to 
know what happened to our client. 
Thank you, sir. 
THE COURT: And you, as Mr. Weingarten, have the same 
view of the nolle prosequi motion? 
MR. WEINBERG: Yes, your Honor. 
THE COURT: OK. 
MS. 
: Your Honor, may I respond to some of those 
points? 
THE COURT: Sure. 
MS. 
: Thank you, your Honor. 
Just briefly. With the exception of the noting that 
the defense does not have an objection to the government's 
motion, virtually everything else that defense counsel just 
argued, respectfully is completely irrelevant to the purposes 
of today's proceeding and to the motion that is pending before 
your Honor. 
As an initial matter, the question --
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
(212) 805-0300 
EFTA00020017
--- PAGE 25 ---
J8RsEPS1 
THE COURT: Well, it may be. Well, I don't know. Yo. 
say irrelevant. 
It is a public hearing, and I think it is fair game 
for defense counsel to raise its concerns. 
MS. 
: Certainly, your Honor. But it is 
irrelevant to whether or not the motion should be granted. 
THE COURT: Right. I get that. 
MS. 
: I would also note that the question of 
Mr. Epstein's death is the subject of an ongoing and active 
investigation, as has been publicly noted, by a separate team 
of Assistant United States Attorneys from the Southern District 
of New York, separate from the team who is handling this 
prosecution, as well as a separate team of FBI agents. 
There is an ongoing and active grand jury 
investigation into the circumstances surrounding Mr. Epstein's 
death. It is the function of a grand jury and of the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation to investigate crimes in the federal 
court system. It is not the purview, respectfully, of the 
court to conduct an investigation into uncharged matters. 
So respectfully, we disagree with defense counsel's 
suggestion that the court has some authority to conduct an 
independent investigation. To the extent any other defendants 
who are detained in the MCC have concerns about the conditions 
or believe that the conditions are relevant to a future or 
current bail determination, it is for those defendants and 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
(212) 805-0300

J8RsEPS1 
their counsel to raise those arguments and for the judges 
hearing those arguments to evaluate those claims. It is not 
relevant to today's proceedings. 
Thank you, your Honor. 
THE COURT: In those other cases, Ms. 
, judges do 
have authority to investigate, but don't here? 
MS. 
: Not to investigate, your Honor, but to 
hear arguments about the conditions of confinement in the MCC 
as they may relate to any bail determination. I believe that 
was the argument that was made. 
The bigger picture here, your Honor, is that the focus 
of today's proceeding, as we understand it, is to allow the 
victims who have gathered here today to be heard and to comment 
upon the case and to comment upon the motion that is pending, 
and to bring this case to a close. 
THE COURT: Got it. 
MR. WEINGARTEN: May I? 
THE COURT: Sure. 
MR. WEINGARTEN: We obviously saw this as, perhaps, 
the last opportunity to be before you, and we wanted to take 
advantage of the opportunity to say our peace and thank you for 
allowing us. 
There is precedent here. Ted Stevens, the Senator 
from Alaska case in Washington, DC, Judge Emmet Sullivan 
ordered an independent investigation by a private lawyer when 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
(212) 805-0300 
EFTA00020019
--- PAGE 27 ---
J8RsEPS1 
he was deeply troubled by the alleged Brady violations. I 
represented the prosecutors in that case, so I'm very, very 
familiar with it. 
It is analogous. It is a situation where there was 
tremendous controversy over what happened in the case and 
whether or not the prosecutors went off the reservation. Judge 
Sullivan -- and there were three or four independent -- not 
independent, DOJ inquiries into the very same matter. But 
Judge Sullivan wanted his own opportunity to make a judgment 
with his own independent investigation. 
THE COURT: OK. 
MR. WEINBERG: If I could just add one precedent, your 
Honor. 
The Chief judge in the District of Massachusetts or 
the Chief Judge at the time, Judge Wolf, in a case called 
U.S. v. Fleming, when the conditions at Walpole, which is a 
state prison where federal prisoners were being held -- we 
don't have a federal MCC in Boston 
went to the prison, 
stayed in the prison to determine whether or not the complaints 
about the conditions were authentic. 
I think your Honor has the inherent authority to go to 
the ninth floor and see how the MCC houses pretrial detainees. 
Thank you. 
THE COURT: Are you saying that whether or not the 
motion is granted that is pending before us? 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

EFTA00020020
--- PAGE 28 ---
J8RsEPS1 
MR. WEINBERG: Yes, your Honor. 
I think, like when appeals are taken, bail issues 
remain before the district court. Jurisdiction is not 
completely divested. Your Honor issued a pretrial detention 
order and your Honor has the power, the inherent authority, 
they are not going to refuse to allow you to go look at the 
ninth floor. They are going to count on you to make decisions 
in the future. 
I just trust that the executive branch is not going to 
prevent the judicial branch from looking into the death of 
Jeffrey Epstein or the conditions in the SHU unit at the MCC, 
sir. 
THE COURT: Great. Thank you. 
MS. 
: May I, your Honor? 
Just very briefly, your Honor. I would note that upon 
the dismissal of the indictment, which I believe the parties 
agree is appropriate in this case, there would be no case. 
There would be no jurisdiction for the court to conduct any 
sort of inquiry, even if the court had such authority. 
THE COURT: Right. 
OK. I think we've heard enough. 
It is at this point in the hearing that I would like 
to call upon victims' counsel, plural, for any remarks they may 
have and they may wish to make. Also, to introduce their 
clients, those of them who wish to be heard.

It would be helpful if, in doing that, if counsel - 
Mr. Edwards and I see and I see Mr. Boise as well -- I know 
they are counsel to several, at least several of the victims. 
It would be helpful if whoever is speaking, both Mr. Edwards 
and Mr. Boise, would indicate to the court whether or not they 
have discussed the pending motion with their clients, that is 
to say and the rule of abatement, etc., etc. with them prior to 
today's hearing. 
Are we going to hear from Mr. Edwards first, is that 
right? 
MR. EDWARDS: Thank you, your Honor. 
THE COURT: You bet. 
It would be helpful, Mr. Edwards, if you would state 
and spell your name for the court reporter. 
If you are going to introduce someone else, which I 
trust that you are, if you could state and spell their name as 
well. 
MR. EDWARDS: Yes, your Honor. 
May it please the court. Brad Edwards, B-r-a-d 
E-d-w-a-r-d-s, with the law firm of Edwards Pottinger. 
I have in the courtroom today 15 victims that I 
represent and have represented over the years. There are at 
least 20 more who didn't make this hearing today for a 
multitude of reasons, some out of fear of public exposure, 
others because the way in which this case ended will never

bring full justice, and they decided it was best for them not 
to talk today. 
Some of my clients are going to address the court that 
are here today. Others are not. Some are going to use their 
names, and have in the past, and others wish to remain 
anonymous. And I have instructed each of them to inform the 
court reporter that they will be proceeding as Jane Doe so that 
the court reporter can take them down. 
THE COURT: For those who wish to remain anonymous? 
MR. EDWARDS: Exactly, your Honor. 
THE COURT: And that is satisfactory, as far as I am 
concerned. 
MR. EDWARDS: Before we do that, I would like to 
address a couple of the things that have occurred this morning. 
First of all, whether relevant or not, I personally, 
and on behalf of my clients, do appreciate the presentation 
that Mr. Weingarten made and Mr. Marty Weinberg made. 
I have tremendous respect for Mr. Weinberg. I've 
worked with him through this and related cases for years, and I 
understand the reason why they made the presentation that they 
made. 
There is two things of interest to our clients in that 
respect. One is, because of the tragic ending, that none of my 
clients wanted, nor did I, nor did anyone else, if there is 
some civil rights violation and there is some civil remedy for 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
(212) 805-0300 
EFTA00020023
--- PAGE 31 ---
J8RsEPS1 
Mr. Epstein that goes to the estate, certainly the victims are 
interested in that as they might help to repair the damage 
done. 
Second, Mr. Epstein's untimely death, the timing is 
curious to us. But more so, it makes it absolutely impossible 
for the victims to ever get the day in court that they wanted 
in court and to get full justice. That now can never happen. 
I know that Mr. Epstein's attorneys say he wanted it, and they 
know, we did too. And there are a lot of people here today 
that are very sad by the way that this ended for both 
Mr. Epstein and the fact that full justice was robbed from 
them, once again. 
The second issue I wanted to address was the Law 
Review or the Law Journal article that your Honor referenced, 
which is troubling because the opinion seems to say that 
transparency is not appropriate in the criminal system and is 
not appropriate at this point in time. 
That's tough to swallow, especially in this case, 
given the long history of this case. Personally, it is tough 
to swallow, and on behalf of my clients, I can say that is very 
concerning. Transparency is the only way that the justice 
system works. We know this because there was a similar 
investigation of Mr. Epstein many years ago, from 2005 to 2008. 
My personal involvement in this case was because a 
young female came into my office named 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
(212) 805-0300 
and she 
EFTA00020024

J8RsEPS1 
came to me not asking to file a lawsuit against Jeffrey 
Epstein, but simply asking for the government to talk to her. 
She was cooperating in an FBI investigation and wanted the 
government to speak with her, and I thought that was going to 
be an easy task. 
It was only a few months later that we learned that 
this investigation that was represented to my client in written 
form, that it would be a long investigation, and to be patient. 
Basically, to hang tight. It was resolved by way of a secret 
deal that never allowed any of the more than 30 victims who had 
been identified of Mr. Epstein's abuse in Florida to ever 
participate in a single hearing. There was a hearing. They 
were never notified. 
I then went on to represent many of them in civil 
cases and also in extensive pro bono work. And I can tell your 
Honor that while Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of them hurt them and 
harmed them for many years, the feelings they had was 
aggravated exponentially by the facts that they had no rights 
in the criminal justice system, by the fact that they were 
treated as if they didn't matter. They were not allowed their 
rights under the Crime Victims' Rights Act to meaningfully 
confer with prosecutors, to be treated with fairness, to be 
treated with dignity. That is what this is supposed to be 
about, and to have notice of hearings. 
So I do want to thank your Honor, and especially the 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

J8RsEPS1 
prosecutors who have worked this investigation and this case, 
which is very different in experience for all of my clients and 
the other Epstein victims in this case, because they were 
allowed to be a part of the process. While some of them 
elected not to be here today, that opportunity should always be 
allowed for them. 
In 2008, we filed that case under the Crime Victims' 
Rights Act because our clients' rights were violated, and as 
your Honor knows, a federal judge has ruled in our clients' 
favor that their rights were violated. So this hearing today 
means a lot to them. The fact that they may never get their 
chance to speak in court, they may never get complete closure, 
and all of us have to wonder, if their rights had been afforded 
them the first time, would any of us be here right now. Or 
wouldn't it more likely be the case that everyone, including 
Jeffrey Epstein, would have turned out better for it? 
Today, I have not only represented, but met and become 
very close with many of these victims. Many of these 
survivors. They are very strong people. They are people who 
have persevered through a lot of adversity. It's been a roller 
coaster of emotions that has led us to where we are today. And 
while they have all been cast over the years because of the 
secrecy of the first investigation, in the shadow as victims, 
you can't put them all in one bucket and say one size fits all. 
They are each individual people who were harmed differently and

distinctly through not only the abuse, but the system. 
And on behalf of all of them, I would like to thank 
your Honor for the fairness with which they've been treated, 
and the United States Attorney's office for the way in which 
you have handled this investigation, and especially how you 
have treated the victims in this case. 
Like I said, I have many who want to speak. Some that 
can't. This is a very difficult day for them. But we 
appreciate the opportunity and the invitation. 
The first client that I have that is going to address 
your Honor is the one who walked into my office in 2008 asking 
just to be heard,

My name is 
and I'm a victim 
of Jeffrey Epstein. Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused me for 
years, robbing me of my innocence and mental health. Jeffrey 
Epstein has done nothing but manipulate our justice system, 
where he has never been held accountable for his actions, even 
to this day. 
Jeffrey Epstein robbed myself and all the other 
victims of our day in court to confront him one by one, and for 
that he is a coward. 
I want to thank the U.S. Attorney's for seeking 
justice that has been long over due, and most importantly, 
given us, the victims, our day in court to speak our peace and 
find some sort of closure. I feel very angry and sad that 
justice has never been served in this case. Thank you. 
THE COURT: Thanks very much. 
MR. EDWARDS: I believe my next client who is going to 
speak is probably going to speak as Jane Doe. 
JANE DOE NO. 1: Yes, Jane Doe.

record. 
JANE DOE NO. 1: Okay. Thank you for allowing us to 
speak today. I've shifted what I want to say in hearing 
what's already been said, and just about the question of 
Jeffrey's death. I don't know what the relevance is to this 
hearing, but I do know that it is profoundly relevant to my

life, as a victim. I don't like that word, but I still feel 
like I am learning the ways that he's impacted me as a complex 
situation, but he was also a major part of my life. As 
destructive as that relationship was and as much of a villain 
as we have created him to be -- based on facts we've created 
him to be a villain -- he's a complex villain and actually all 
of that is irrelevant. Anybody deserves -- an investigation is 
the right thing to do. Like, we do need to know how he died. 
It felt like a whole new trauma all over again, and I 
don't know why, you know, because I 
I'm trying to defend 
myself against him at this point in my life, but it still does 
not feel good. It didn't feel good to wake up that morning and 
find out that he had allegedly committed suicide. Okay. But I 
also wanted to say to the press, I'm reading -- I read my story 
in the paper. I read so many other girls' stories that are so 
similar to my own, and everything that's been focused on is not 
the most important part of it. 
There was -- the problem with focusing on these, the 
facts of the situation, that were out of the ordinary and like 
because he was such a grand person, and it was just a unique 
situation. I know that that's the more interesting side of the 
story, but I don't want to be used as entertainment. And the 
problem, the fundamental problem of the whole situation is the 
element of exploitation and coercion, and these are things that 
so many girls can relate to.

And even though this Jeffrey Epstein brought it to a 
grand scale, on some level, a lot of girls could relate to the 
trauma that we are talking about, and even though this whole 
situation sucks, I would like to think that it may be possibly 
a catalyst for change because, obviously, as we're seeing with 
the "Me Too" movement, change needs to happen and it's -- what 
I'm seeing in the papers is not a common story, but it's so 
much more common than you realize. That's all. Thank you. 
THE COURT: Thank you very much. 
MR. EDWARDS: I believe that the next client is going 
to also be a Jane Doe; so I think for the purposes of the 
record it will be Jane Doe 2. 
THE COURT: Yes. 
JANE DOE NO. 2: Good morning, your Honor. 
THE COURT: Good morning. How are you? 
JANE DOE NO. 2: Doing okay. I hadn't prepared any 
words to speak today, but there is something that was on my 
mind this morning when I got here. It's been on my mind in 
reading through the press and through the people that I've 
spoken to about it, friends, family. It's something that's 
bothered me because I think it has a lot of blame in it, as 
well, a little bit of what my friend, who was up here, was 
speaking about. 
I think that a lot of people asked why we spent so 
much time, why we stayed. It's an experience that's really 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
(212) 805-0300 
EFTA00020030
--- PAGE 38 ---
J8RPEPS2 
hard to explain to people who haven't gone through it. I think 
there's a writer, Thomas Nagel, who wrote an essay called "What 
is it like to be a bat?" And I think that he touches on it 
pretty strongly and if you haven't experienced something, it's 
very hard to fully understand why someone makes the decisions 
they do and what the circumstances were. 
I don't want to speak for all of the victims. I think 
each of us has a different story and different circumstances 
for why we stayed in it, but for me, I think he was really 
strategic in how he approached each of us. Things happened 
slowly over time. We didn't -- it almost was like, putting it 
like that analogy of a frog being in a pan of water and slowly 
turning the flame up. You didn't realize it was happening, and 
it just -- I don't think anyone can fully understand the 
experience, but I just -- the blame feels very strong. 
There's a lot of support as well, but i just want 
people to try and understand that we aren't bad people. We 
weren't trying to -- it wasn't a situation where we were trying 
to extort money from someone. A lot of us were in very 
vulnerable situations and in extreme poverty, circumstances 
where we didn't have anyone on our side, to speak on our 
behalf, and that's really scary. 
You start to blame yourself because, at first, you 
don't tell anyone what's happening, and it becomes your deep, 
dark secret that you tried to keep from everyone. And I didn't

even know I was a victim until I spoke with my lawyers. I had 
no idea. I had so much self-hatred and doubt and just guilt 
for everything. I still do. I still don't feel like I deserve 
to say I'm a victim, and I think that's a big problem with our 
society right now, that people are still blaming victims, and I 
think that does need to change. 
I hope that today people understand that each of us 
has a story, has a past, has a family and just give us a chance 
to 
you know, that's basically all I just wanted to say. 
THE COURT: Thank you so much. 
JANE DOE NO. 2: Thank you so much. 
THE COURT: Okay. 
MR. EDWARDS: Okay. I think that the next person who 
is going to speak is also going to be speaking as Jane Doe; so 
for the purpose of the record, Jane Doe No. 3. 
JANE DOE NO. 3: Thank you for allowing us to speak 
today. I came to New York City 15 years ago to pursue modeling 
from a small town. I signed on with an agency and was excited 
to pursue my passion and my dream. Several months later, I met 
a female who told me about Mr. Epstein. She portrayed him as 
an amazing man who genuinely cared for people and that he was 
going to be able to help me in a modeling career. 
I was excited to meet him, after hearing her talk 
about him. He sounded like an amazing person. An introduction 
was made at his New York home, and it is there that I was

sexually assaulted. I left his home, after he threw me, 
basically put money on the table, and I was ashamed. I was 
embarrassed. This was not the way I was brought up, and I 
couldn't believe this had happened to me. 
I left and my world kind of spiraled after that. I 
stopped going on modeling castings. I gained weight. I became 
depressed. I stopped going out with my friends, and only five 
months after I had been in New York City to pursue my dream, 
left. I left the modeling industry, and I left New York City, 
and I totally switched my career paths. 
I buried this deep within me, and all of the new 
occurrences that have come up in the media is what brought it 
back up for me. And I feel sickened and saddened that it took 
so many years, and God knows how many victims, for this to 
finally come out, but I'm thankful it did. And I'm just angry 
that he's not alive anymore to have to pay the price for his 
actions. So I thank you for your time. 
THE COURT: You're very welcome. 
MR. EDWARDS: Your Honor, Jane Doe No. 4, I believe, 
is going to speak now. 
JANE DOE NO. 4: Good morning, your Honor. 
THE COURT: Good morning. 
JANE DOE NO. 4: I just have something very short to 
say. I met Jeffrey Epstein at a very vulnerable place in my 
life, and whatever the outcome is with everything, I just 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
(212) 805-0300 
EFTA00020033
--- PAGE 41 ---
J8RPEPS2 
wanted to express that we, the victims, we will always carry 
irreparable damage and pain throughout our lives after this. 
It's something that's never going to go away. 
You know, whoever we marry in our life, whatever 
future we have in our life, it's always going to be something 
that's always there for us. And I'm very nervous right now. 
And Jeffrey Epstein, he took away the chance I had at having 
the future I had envisioned for myself as a young girl, and I 
think many of us here today will never fully heal from that 
pain and the heartache that we'll continue carrying with us. 
So I just wanted to say that. It's something that 
it's irreparable. I can't even really use a better word to 
describe that. So thank you for hearing us today. 
THE COURT: You're very welcome. 
MR. EDWARDS: Your Honor, Jane Doe No. 5 would like to 
speak. 
JANE DOE NO. 5: This is a letter that I wrote; so 
it's going to be: Dear Jeffrey, I think you are a mentally 
disturbed human being. You used your power to make me believe 
at a young age that I could have my dreams of being a model. 
You paid for your freedom. You violated my rights. You should 
have to pay for them, just as anyone else. You got a plea deal 
that no one else would have been able to get. You used your 
money to get out of paying the price for your actions. 
Also, as a victim, I never got to see what the 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

J8RPEPS2 
agreement was or why the special treatment got approved. 
think you should have been in jail for several years in 
population and live like everyone else that is mentally 
disturbed like you. You paid for yourself to get special 
treatment while you were in jail. I don't even think you spent 
a day in a jail as a normal human being. 
You had investigators come to my house and also went 
to my friend's house to question them. I will never be able to 
over -- I will never be able to get over the overwhelming 
emotions and embarrassment I experienced from that trauma. I 
needed therapy several times a week and had high stress and 
anxiety levels. 
You paid your way to make the public think that the 
girls had nothing in life going on for them. You wanted to try 
and blame that we were lower class and that was the problem 
with the girls. I was from a middle class family and did well 
in school. I lived the American girl dream -- or the American 
girl life. I went on family vacations around the world, grew 
up in a good city, and my parents are still married to this 
day. Basically, everything you said that we didn't have in our 
life, I did. 
It all came down to I was told I was making $200 in an 
hour. Being young, that was a lot of money, and I didn't know 
any better. Sadly, you were the one with an illness that you 
should have to go and see a doctor and also have a mentor group

for the sickness you have. I will continue with writing my 
book about that secret life, with all the newspaper articles of 
the case, my high school agenda book of official dates. I'm 
basing that proof that I deposited cash after leaving 
Jeffrey's. I still have all of the information, articles that 
I collected over the years. 
You mentally and physically traumatized me. I went to 
therapy, and it was the best thing I did for myself. If anyone 
only learns one thing from this case, I hope is that money 
should not let you buy your way free. A crime is a crime and a 
victim is a victim. Thank you. 
THE COURT: Thank you. Thank you very much. 
MR. EDWARDS: Your Honor, my next client is 
I met Jeffrey Epstein through my first 
massage teacher, a man who took me in as his apprentice to 
teach me a practice I wanted to learn while in desperate search 
to find a cure for a debilitating neurological disorder that 
have, which manifests into violent vomiting attacks, largely 
triggered by stress. It's called Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome. 
I was recruited by Ghislaine Maxwell. Upon my first 
meeting of her, I wouldn't know I had been recruited until many 
years later, when I would read it in a headline. Ghislaine and 
Jeffrey took me in. They sent me to school. They gave me a 
job. They flew me around the world, introduced me to a world I 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
(212) 805-0300 
EFTA00020036
--- PAGE 44 ---
J8RPEPS2 
had only dreamt of and made me feel as though I had become a 
part of their family, another thing I was desperately searching 
for. 
But on my third or fourth time meeting them, they 
brought me to Jeffrey's island for the first time, and on the 
first night there, 
came tapping on my door late at 
night to inform me Jeffrey was ready for another massage. My 
instincts told me this didn't feel right, but I got up and 
followed her to a villa I hadn't yet seen. Jeffrey and 
Ghislaine's villa. 
I began my massage, trying not to let him smell my 
fear and obvious discomfort, but before I knew what was 
happening, he grabbed onto my wrist and tugged me towards the 
I spent two weeks vomiting, almost to death, in a 
Los Angeles hospital after that first encounter. Jeffrey's 
abuse would continue for the next three years, and I allowed it

J8RPEPS2 
to continue because I had been taken advantage of my entire 
life and had been conditioned to just accept it. 
It took me a long time to come forward, too long 
maybe, and all it took to bring -- and all that it took to 
bring this man to justice has been robbed by his death. Every 
day, every week I've spent in the hospital since, I've suffered 
and he has won. Every job offer that's been offered to me and 
then retracted because of my connection to this case, I have 
suffered and he has won. Every public humiliation I have 
endured, I have suffered and he has won. Every relationship 
that I've had to end because of the abuse that I have endured 
by the hands of this man, I have suffered and he has won. 
Every woman sitting in this room today, and all of the 
women who have yet come forward and who have not yet to come 
forward and whose lives have been affected by Jeffrey Epstein's 
sick abuse of young girls, we have all suffered, and he is 
still winning in death. 
I refuse to let this man win in death. I couldn't 
fight back when Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused me because I 
hadn't yet found my voice. Well, I have found my voice now, 
and while Jeffrey may no longer be here to hear it, I will not 
stop fighting, and I will not be silenced anymore. I needed 
him to hear the pain he's caused, what I've gone through 
because of him. I wrote a 350-page book of all the pain that I 
have endured at the hands of this man that I really needed him

to hear. His death has robbed me of that justice. 
Please don't rob us of justice again. Thank you. 
THE COURT: Thank you. 
MR. EDWARDS: Your Honor, I think I have one more 
client that is going to speak today, 
THE COURT: Would you spell that? 
Good morning, your Honor. 
THE COURT: Good morning. 
My name is spelled 
Thank you, your Honor, for giving us the opportunity 
to be heard this morning. 
THE COURT: Sure. 
When I was introduced to Jeffrey 
Epstein, I was young and full of hope and the foolishness of 
teenager. I was idealistic, and I saw the good in people. 
Jeffrey Epstein manipulated me, coerced me and sexually abused 
me. 
Something I think is very important to communicate is 
that loss of innocence, trust and joy is not recoverable. The 
abuse, spanning several years, was devaluing beyond measure and 
affected my ability 
both in my work and 
fathom what he took 
to form and maintain healthy relationships, 
my personal life. He could not begin to 
from us, and I say "us" because I am every 
girl he did this to, and they're all me. And today we stand

together, those that are present and those that aren't. 
I was a victim, and it has taken me many, many years 
to stand here and say, yes, it was me. I was a victim, but 1 
will not remain a victim and be silent for one more day. 
Although I think it's tragic when anybody dies before their 
time, I'm extremely relieved that Jeffrey Epstein will not be 
in a position to hurt anymore children or anymore women, and 
I'm glad to be part of a group of women who are now bonded 
forever in the trauma that we endured at the hands of this man. 
Thank you. 
THE COURT: Thank you. 
MR. EDWARDS: Your Honor, we had one client who was 
not able to be here but sent a message through a letter. Her 
name is 
last name, 
And Brittany Henderson, of my office, is going to 
read her letter as instructed. 
THE COURT: Sure. 
MS. HENDERSON: Thank you, your Honor. 
THE COURT: Yup. 
MS. HENDERSON: What happened to me occurred many 
years ago when I was in high school, but it still effects my 
life. I was told then that Jeffrey Epstein was going to be 
held accountable, but he was not. In fact, the government 
worked out a secret deal and didn't tell me about it. The case 
ended without me knowing what was going on, without him being 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
(212) 805-0300 
EFTA00020040
--- PAGE 48 ---
JSRPEPS2 
held responsible, without any explanation and without a chance 
for my voice to be heard. I was treated like I did not matter. 
Many years later, he was arrested again. These 
investigators and attorneys representing the United States have 
been completely different. I am still mad, concerned and 
confused about how he committed suicide and escaped 
responsibility again, but I know it is not the fault of the 
judge or the government attorneys. 
I was allowed to be a part of the process this time. 
My attorney was able to tell me what was going on at every 
stage because they kept him informed. Thank you for inviting 
me. It means more to me than you can ever know. I was not 
able to be here this time, but I know that I was allowed to be 
and I had the chance to attend this hearing, which is helping 
me in my healing process. The fact that I mattered this time 
and the other victims mattered is what counts. For that, I am 
grateful. 
THE COURT: Thank you. 
MR. EDWARDS: Your Honor, finally, in 2008 when I 
filed the case under the Crime Victims Rights Act, it wasn't me 
alone. I did it with Paul Cassell and Jay Howell. 
Paul Cassell is here today, and I think your Honor 
even cited to a piece of -- an opinion of his from when he was 
on the bench, and he has some remarks to make. 
Once again, your Honor, I really do believe that this 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
(212) 805-0300 
EFTA00020041
--- PAGE 49 ---
J8RPEPS2 
is a model for how victims should be treated in a criminal 
process, and we really do appreciate it. Thank you. 
THE COURT: Thank you. 
MR. CASSELL: I'll be very brief because I know there 
are others that want to speak here. I'm Paul Cassell, 
C-a-s-s-e-1-1, previously served as a federal judge at the 
District of Utah, currently a law professor, where I teach 
crime victims rights at the University of Utah, College of Law. 
I just wanted to take one minute to address some 
suggestion that there would be no need for a hearing this 
morning. I think, having heard already from these powerful 
victims and recognizing how important giving those statements 
will be in the trajectory of their lives, makes clear that your 
Honor has followed exactly the right path. Legally, there is 
one precedent, which is U.S. v. Heaton, a case that you cited 
that I wrote about a decade ago, and as explained in that 
opinion, victims have important interests in the criminal 
justice system that can only be recognized if they're given 
their day in court. 
With all due respect to other law professors that have 
recently written an article, I think transparency is one of the 
overriding objectives in our criminal justice system, and the 
one substantive action that I would urge your Honor to take 
today is to publish your remarks as a published opinion. The 
Heaton case is, to my knowledge, the only reported decision on 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
(212) 805-0300 
EFTA00020042
--- PAGE 50 ---
J8RPEPS2 
this particular issue, even though it's more than a decade old 
and, yet, we can see today that these problems recur in many 
other cases. Your remarks today, I think, should be published 
so that they can serve as a guide for other judges around the 
country. 
I would encourage you to add into your remarks a 
reference to the Crime Victims Rights Act. The Crime Victims 
Right Act promises victims the right to be treated with 
fairness, dignity and respect, and the process that we see 
unfolding this morning is a clear example of how victims can be 
treated with fairness, dignity and respect. 
So I know that your Honor is wondering what is the 
appropriate action here. Unfortunately, it seems like there 
are no other legal options, but there was a legal option for 
you to decide to exercise, which was to allow these victims to 
come forward. And if there's been one positive thing that has 
come out of the tragedies, the abuse, the other events of this 
case, it's been your decision to allow these victims to be 
heard this morning, and I encourage you to publish your 
decision and to encourage other judges to follow what is 
clearly a model for crime victims rights and is clearly an 
example that should be followed in other cases down the road. 
THE COURT: Thank you very much. I appreciate your 
being here. I had no idea that you would be here when I wrote 
the remarks, but it was clear from the literature that you are 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
(212) 805-0300 
EFTA00020043
--- PAGE 51 ---
J8RPEPS2 
the leading expert formerly of the District Court of Utah, I 
believe, and it's a pleasure to have you here today. 
MR. CASSELL: Thank you, your Honor. 
THE COURT: Thanks. 
Mr. Boies? 
MR. BOIES: Thank you, your Honor. David Boies of 
Boies Schiller Flexner. We have with us today five of the 
victims that we represent. There are a number of additional 
victims who either were unable to attend or are still unwilling 
to come forward publicly. This has been an enormously 
traumatic aspect of their lives, something that, as you've 
already heard and will hear more today, is something that they 
can never entirely escape from. 
I want to, as prior counsel have, commend both the 
Court and counsel for the Department of Justice for the 
consideration and respect and attention that they have paid to 
the victims. We believe that that is not only right, as a 
matter of human dignity, but we think that is exactly what the 
law requires and intends. 
I will be more blunt than the Court has been, or 
Professor Cassell has been about Professor Green's article. 
That is an article that cites no authority, and I believe there 
is no authority for his proposition. I entirely respect his 
right to advocate on behalf of his client Alan Dershowitz, who 
has retained him in connection with litigation that we've 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
(212) 805-0300 
EFTA00020044
--- PAGE 52 ---
J8RPEPS2 
brought against Mr. Dershowitz, but I would have expected that 
the Law Journal or Professor Green himself would have disclosed 
that connection, which I think is a conflict. 
But regardless of the appropriateness of his 
disclosure, or lack of disclosure, I think that his article 
opposing allowing the victims to have a voice in this 
proceeding is inconsistent not only with the policy that 
underlies the Crime Victim Rights Act and the very statute that 
Mr. Epstein is being prosecuted under, but it ignores the 
actual language of those statutes, and many other statutes, in 
which Congress has made clear that the purpose of the criminal 
law is no longer simply to punish the individual defendant, but 
it is to find some way of trying to mitigate the damage that 
has been done to the victims through restitution and economic 
mitigation, but also through the ability to confront and to 
have the court system and the justice system and the 
prosecutors treat these victims as they are victims, as they 
are human beings, and they are entitled to the respect that our 
society needs to give every human being. So I think that this 
is not only commendable, but I think it is what the law 
requires. 
In response to the question the Court asked, I have 
discussed this hearing with my clients. I have told them that, 
under the applicable law, the government has no alternative but 
to move to dismiss this case, and I believe under the 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
(212) 805-0300 
EFTA00020045
--- PAGE 53 ---
JSRPEPS2 
applicable law in this circuit, the Court has no alternative 
but to grant that motion. 
I think the current law is outdated, as the Court 
suggested in some of its remarks. I think there will come a 
time when either an Appellate court or the Congress will make 
clear that, just as it's possible to continue civil cases 
against someone after they have deceased, it is possible, at 
least for purposes of things like restitution, to continue 
criminal cases, but we are not there now. And, fortunately, in 
this case, there are other ways and perhaps even more efficient 
ways to vindicate the interests of the victims here. 
We greatly appreciate the remarks of the 
representative of the Department of Justice today, and we, too, 
on behalf of the victims, are not going to stop when we walk 
out of this courtroom. We are going to continue to seek 
vindication against Mr. Epstein's estate and, in some senses, 
perhaps even more important, against the people who worked with 
him and enabled him. 
As you have already heard, and will hear more, 
Mr. Epstein did not act alone. He could not have done what he 
did, on the scope and the scale of what he did, for as many 
years as he did it without the activities and support and the 
co-conspirator activity of a number of other key individuals, 
and those individuals also need to bear their share of 
responsibility, and those people need to have a reckoning as

well. 
My partner Sig McCawley, who's been working with me 
for more than five years on this case, is going to, with the 
Court's permission, introduce five of our clients who will 
speak briefly to your Court. Thank you very much. 
THE COURT: Thank you very much, Mr. Boies. Pleasure 
to have you here. 
MS. McCAWLEY: Thank you, your Honor, the first victim 
that would like to speak today is 
THE COURT: Can we have the spelling of your name? 
MS. McCAWLEY: Sure. Sigrid, S-i-g-r-i-d, and the 
last name is M-c-C-a-w-1-e-y, and I'm a partner at Boies 
Schiller Flexner. 
THE COURT: Thank you. 
Good morning. 
THE COURT: Good morning. 
Thank you, prosecutors and Judge, and the 
Court. My name is 
I note today I do feel 
respected and listened to; so I appreciate that, and I have to 
say that I commend the boldness of the New York prosecutors for 
pursuing a man that has, you know -- and others, that have 
clearly taken a lot from a lot of people. 
years ago I knew him only as "Jeffrey." I was 
recruited and brought from California to New York, and that

experience for the last 17 years has been a dark corner in my 
story, in my life, in my life story and that has been 
definitely made worse by my own self-shame and that -- and 
anger for normalizing all of the red flags. I feel like we are 
conditioned to do that, and that's something that needs to 
change. 
So I'm here today, you know, I'm coming forward 
because it is time to bring light to that darkness, and it's 
time to replace that darkness with light. And I am a survivor 
of this, and I do aim to progress further from being a 
survivor, you know. I feel I've worked hard, quite hard, to 
get to where I'm at now, and I'm definitely at a place in my 
life where I will no longer cover up. I'll no longer cover up 
what needs to be brought to light. 
Jeffrey is no longer here, and the women that helped 
him are, Ghislaine Maxwell. My experience is with Ghislaine 
Maxwell and 
and they definitely need to be held 
accountable for helping him, helping themselves, helping one 
another carry on this huge, almost like a system. So they need 
to be held accountable, all of them, and I would like to see 
that, certainly on behalf of myself and for everyone here. 
Thank you. 
THE COURT: Thanks so much.

years and years, unstopped. 
Thank you for allowing me to address the Court and 
speak the truth. I commend the prosecutors from the Southern 
District of New York for the ongoing investigation and its 
pursuit of justice for us victims. It has given me hope, and I 
will not let go of that hope. 
When I was recruited by Ghislaine Maxwell at 
Mar-a-Lago, just before I was 17, I thought I was given a big 
break, and I'd be able to reset my life and become an actual 
real massage therapist. My hopes were quickly dashed, and my 
dreams were stolen. Jeffrey Epstein

Thank you, your Honor. My name is 
I'm a victim of Jeffrey Epstein and 
Ghislaine Maxwell's international sex trafficking ring. 
I would like to thank the Court for the dignity and 
the respect you are showing me here today, as well as the other 
victims. I would also like to acknowledge and extend my 
gratitude to the prosecutors from the Southern District of 
New York for pursuing justice on behalf of the victims. 
Please, please finish what you have started. I struggled to 
find the words to adequately say how important your work is to 
us. 
For a very long time Jeffrey Epstein gamed the system 
at every level, and when he realized he couldn't do that any 
longer, he showed the world what a depraved and cowardly human 
being he is by taking his own life. But we, the victims, are 
still here, prepared to tell the truth, and we all know he did 
not act alone. We are survivors, and the pursuit of justice 
should not abate. Thank you, your Honor. 
THE COURT: You're very welcome.

speaking this morning is 
Good morning, your Honor. 
THE COURT: Good morning. 
I had the opportunity to speak at Jeffrey Epstein's 
bail hearing, and I really appreciate that you heard me and 
listened to me that day. I am so sorry that others will not 
have the opportunity to stand before him the way that I did. 
But I'm here today to speak on behalf of my sister, 
who could not be here. 
Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell not only assaulted 
her, but as we're hearing from so many of these brave women 
here today, they stole her dreams and her livelihood. She 
risked her safety in 1996, so many years ago, to report them, 
to no avail, and it is heartbreaking to her and to me that all 
this destruction has been wrought since that time. 
We were deeply disappointed and disturbed by Epstein's 
death and the fact that that was allowed to happen while he was 
in the government's custody, and I'm encouraged to hear that 
there will be a full investigation as to how that was allowed 
to happen. 
But it is extremely important, as others are saying, 
that he did not act alone and that the other people that were a 
part of what he did are held accountable and that that 
investigation continues.

I believe that we have a real problem in this country 
with perpetrators of sexual abuse and sexual assault being held 
accountable. There are so many roadblocks to victims being 
heard, to cases being investigated thoroughly, and then to 
those cases being prosecuted. And so I think this is a really 
important signal to send a message to victims out there that 
people will take you seriously, people will follow through, and 
that even those in power, as we have unfortunately seen, that 
has not been often are able to escape that, that even those in 
power will be held accountable. Thank you. 
THE COURT: Thanks so much.

My name is 
and I am a victim of 
Jeffrey Epstein and the sophisticated sex trafficking operation 
he ran, where he allegedly was to be a financier. 
I was 20 and previously modeled and was living in the 
West Village. I met a young woman named 
through a mutual 
friend. We were friends for a few months. She was an amazing 
artist and liked to party. One day she called me and asked if 
I was interested in meeting a friend of hers. She told me he 
wanted to meet me and really liked blonds, and I thought he was

our age and liked to do the same things we did at that age; so 
I agreed. 
On a sunny, crisp day, we took the train together to 
the Upper East Side. She then began to talk a little bit about 
him on our way to his house. I was at his house. I was 
sexually assaulted by both 
and Jeffrey Epstein in his 
mansion. It left me feeling both disgusted and betrayed. 
As we walked home to the subway afterwards, she 
continued to tell me about the man who had just abused me with 
her participation. She seemed exhilarated from the horrific 
experience. I was shocked and in a daze. This is a few things 
that she had told me. She told me he went to Cooper Union. He 
was a mathematical genius. That he had favorite girls that he 
would take to Chanel for 15-minute, all-you-can-buy shopping 
trips. She told me his right-hand person had connection to the 
arts and the fashion world, and she could help me. 
This is not my complete story. I'll stop here. I'm 
in a good, stable place in my life, and I had decided to come 
forward to be a voice to the victims who may not be able to 
tell their story, or at least not yet. I feel like I am a 
survivor. 
Thank you, Judge Berman, for inviting victims to speak 
today before you. We hope the government is listening very 
closely to the words we are saying.

individual. However, he was also a thief. He stolen, 
childhood dreams, her innocence and her self-confidence. She 
was 14 years old. What he could not buy, he forcibly took. 
Why? Because he surrounded himself with a network of powerful 
people who not only looked the other way, but also actively 
facilitated and participated in his sexual abuse of children. 
Jeffrey Epstein thought he was above the law, and 
essentially he was until now. The system let 
and the 
other victims down, but it does not have to end here. We ask 
the U.S. Attorney's Office and the FBI to bring all of 
Epstein's enablers and co-conspirators to justice. 
It has taken 
years to find her voice, and 
again, Jeffrey Epstein has tried to silence her. While she 
will never have her chance to face him in court, he no longer 
has any power over her. Today, this brave survivor will be 
heard. 
Thank you for allowing me to be able to 
have my chance in court today, to be able to tell you what this 
horrific man did to my life. You can't even imagine how much 
it affected my childhood, all the way through my adult life. 
He robbed me of my dreams. He robbed me of my chance to pursue 
a career I always adored. He stole my chance at really feeling 
love because I was so scared to trust anyone for so many years 
that I had such severe anxiety. I didn't want to leave my 
house let alone my bed.

The fact that he felt entitled to take away my 
innocence, the fact that he felt that he could do whatever he 
wanted, regardless of the laws, hurts me so very much. It took 
me years to tell anyone what Epstein did to me because I was so 
ashamed and embarrassed at what people would say or think of me 
until I found out there were other victims, girls just like me. 
I knew I could no longer keep my silence no matter how ruthless 
and powerful Epstein was, and still is even after his death. 
The fact I will never have a chance to face my 
predator in court eats away at my soul. Even in death, Epstein 
is trying to hurt me. I had hoped to at last get an apology, 
but this evil man had no remorse or caring for what he did to 
anyone. I felt let down by the people who were supposed to 
watch him in prison. They let this man kill himself and kill 
the chance of justice for so many others in the process, taking 
away our ability to speak. 
Out of all the damages and side effects that Epstein 
caused by his heartless and selfish acts, it's very hard to put 
my feelings and emotions into words, trying to let his 
horrendous actions go and attempting to forgive him, has been 
so difficult for me. Yet, as hard as it's been to come so 
publicly forward, I refuse to let Epstein take me as a victim 
anymore. 
I am a survivor. The many that stand before me here 
today that have shared the horrific experiences with this

deplorable human being, because even though this weak, evil 
coward tried to steal all of our childhoods, tried to steal all 
of our innocence and tried to steal all of our means of 
justice, he will never steal our inner strength, and he will 
never, ever, ever steal our voice. Thank you so much. 
THE COURT: You're welcome. 
MS. GIBBS: Good morning, your Honor. Teri Gibbs, 
T-e-r-i, G-i-b-b-s. For the record, I am a California 
attorney. I'm not admitted to the New York State bar. I am 
here to make a statement on behalf of New York attorney, Lisa 
Bloom. I work for her firm, The Bloom Firm. 
Lisa Bloom represents four of Jeffrey Epstein's 
victims, Jane Doe 6, for the record, Jane Doe 7 and Jane Doe 8. 
I am so proud of all of you victims who are here today and are 
able to voice yourselves today. I will not and cannot comment 
on the criminal case, or Ms. Bloom's communications with her 
clients. 
Ms. Bloom would like to share three of her client's 
statements for the record. Here are the statements. Statement 
of Jane Doe 6. 
To the Honorable Richard M. Berman. Jeffrey Epstein 
stole my innocence. He gave me a life sentence of guilt and 
shame. I do not consider myself a victim. I see myself a 
survivor. The abuse that I endured cannot continue. Let's 
stop this before it happens to other young women. Jane Doe.

J8RPEPS2 
Statement of Jane Doe 7. To the Honorable Richard M. 
Berman. I used to be relatively carefree, inquisitive, hopeful 
and excited about life, but my life changed because of Jeffrey 
Epstein. My perspective on life became very dark when I was 
unknowingly recruited by one of his agents. Jeffrey Epstein 
ruined me. His recruiter ruined me. The far-reaching 
consequences of that day ruined my family's lives. 
I've chosen to remain anonymous in order to protect my 
family from unwanted media attention. 
I was just trying to figure out my path in life when I 
encountered Jeffrey Epstein in his New York City mansion. I 
cannot even begin to summarize the many detriments this 
experience of sexual assault has had on my life. Immediately 
following the incident, I was unable to function and be around 
other people. My parents had to rescue me and bring me home, 
where I became a recluse for years. 
I was changed forever and buried my assault deep down, 
where the darkness couldn't hurt me anymore, but of course, it 
has always been here, lingering and affecting me unconsciously. 
At the time, I was mired in shame, guilt and humiliation. I 
had somehow tricked myself into thinking that I had allowed the 
assault to happen, that I did it to myself, that I don't 
deserve to be alive or to be loved. I believed that I was a 
disgusting, shameful person who does not deserve to ever be 
happy. These are the thoughts I've lived with on a daily

basis. 
Furthermore, because I couldn't tell anyone, out of 
fear of judgment, blame or retaliation, keeping this secret 
completely hindered my ability to uncover why these issues 
existed for me, which could have led to a path of healing over 
the years. 
It is time for those of power to do the right thing. 
It is time for compassion toward our fellow human beings to 
reign over money, power and greed. We need to protect our most 
vulnerable to allow them a chance at a normal life, and nothing 
should come in the way of that. I believe that for future 
generations, including my own children, this case will set a 
precedent that victims must no longer suffer in silence on our 
own or be shamed for coming forward to seek protection. 
This case should demonstrate to those who want to harm 
others that there will be a reckoning, and they will pay dearly 
for the harm they inflict on innocent people. Judge Berman, : 
thank you for from the bottom of my heart for this forum and 
opportunity. 
To all of those survivors who came before me, I 
commend your bravery. There is no way I could have done this 
without you. 
Thank you to the public following this story, for your 
outrage and desire for answers, which will hopefully move this 
case forward so that victims can stop having to relive their

experiences every day and move on to begin to heal. 
God bless the victims, their families, the 
investigators and public servants working so diligently to find 
those answers and to right all these wrongs. Jane Doe 7.

THE COURT: Thanks very much. 
MS. GIBBS: One more. Statement of Jane Doe 8. 
In the past few weeks, i have had to reflect on my 
interaction with Jeffrey Epstein and realized that, though I 
have yet to put it all behind me, I am still a victim. I say 
this because I have to come to terms with it in an effort to 
truly get past the abuse I suffered at the hands of Epstein. 
Pursuing criminal penalties against him and having an 
opportunity to address the egregious crimes he committed 
against me and other young woman would have helped my recovery 
process. This all came to an abrupt halt when he took his own 
life. This point of disclosure is lost. 
I cannot say that I am pleased he committed suicide, 
but I am at peace knowing he will not be able to hurt anyone 
else. However, a sad truth remains. I, along with other 
people, will never have an answer as to why. I will never have 
an apology for the wrongdoing. And most importantly, Epstein 
will not be justly sentenced for his crimes. Now I sit in my 
home questioning the well-being of those girls like myself. In 
choosing death, Epstein denied everyone justice. 
Any efforts made to protect Epstein's name and legacy 
send a message to the victims that he wins and that he is 
untouchable. I understand his case may be dismissed or closed, 
but this makes me feel as though I, and anyone else who fell 
pry to his hands, simply do not matter.

I ask that you very seriously consider the final 
decision, because it will undoubtedly affect all other facets 
of this case, including any future charges brought against the 
recruiters or third parties to his crimes. I do not want the 
narrative to be, Those poor girls. I want to send a message to 
anyone who would consider engaging in similar acts to think 
twice beforehand. I want some sort of closure for those of us 
who relive those horrible moments where we were assaulted, 
abused, and taken advantage of by Epstein. 
You have the opportunity to help us seek that closure. 
I appreciate your time and consideration and ask for your 
continued support in dealing with this case to illustrate that 
we, Epstein's victims, do matter. 
Sincerely, Jane Doe 8. 
On behalf of Lisa Bloom and The Bloom Firm, thank you, 
your Honor.

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

afford the victims their voice, because many of them have never 
spoken before. They never spoke in Florida. They never spoke 
anywhere. They never told their mother. They never told their 
father. They never told their family members. This is an 
opportunity for them to be heard. We thank you for that. 
Your Honor, for 43 years my firm has been the leading 
women's rights private law firm in the United States. We have 
helped thousands of victims. And I, as an officer of the 
court, and as a believer in the system, have tried to encourage 
the victims to have confidence in the system that should 
provide them access to justice that should help them to assert 
and vindicate their rights in a court of law. It has been 
increasingly difficult in this case for me to say to my clients 
that they should have confidence in the system of justice given 
what has occurred in this case, People v. Jeffrey Epstein. 
Having said that, I am encouraged by the fact that 
this court, essentially, in an unprecedented situation where 
the defendant is deceased, is still affording these victims an 
opportunity to be heard. So we thank you for that. It is some 
encouragement. 
Your Honor, you also asked do our clients wish to be 
heard in reference to some of the issues that have been raised 
this morning, including what should happen into this case. 
Your Honor, there has been a suggestion that the court should 
investigate the circumstances of the death of Mr. Epstein. I'm 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
(212) 805-0300 
EFTA00020063

J8RsEPS3 
not going to repeat the arguments made by counsel, but I would 
say that if there is jurisdiction, and I know that is a legal 
issue which has been previously argued, that certainly it would 
increase the confidence of my clients. Not just my clients, 
but victims all over, and some are, by the way, located in 
other parts of the world, to have the court oversee the 
investigation. 
We are encouraged by the sensitivity of the attorneys 
for the United States Attorney's office for the Southern 
District of New York and the investigation that is going on 
with the separate team. However, and, of course, the defense 
is also conducting its own investigation. But I do think the 
greatest confidence would be if the court in some way would be 
able to oversee an investigation because the court is a neutral 
party. And although the court certainly has a stake in finding 
out what happened to defendants who are in the custody of the 
federal system and who should be there to face the prosecutors 
and the charges against them, but now are not because clearly 
the system has failed. 
And the United States Attorney has admitted that, and 
even before he admitted that, everybody knows the system 
failed. Failed the victims, failed the court, failed everyone. 
In any event, your Honor, having seen so many 
thousands of victims of gender violence, sex harassment, sexual 
assault, I've dealt with child sex trafficking, child

J8RsEPS3 
molesters, I mean, this is a unique case because there are so 
many victims and so many failures of the system. At this 
point, what we would really ask for is not just words, but 
words have been helpful, but deeds, and that is very important. 
In addition, I would like to say, throughout this case 
is the running theme of the betrayal of trust. Betrayal of 
trust by Jeffrey Epstein. Betrayal of trust by the system. 
And betrayal of trust to the victims who had a right to 
justice. And the Crime Victims' Act should not just be words, 
it should have meaning and it should be enforced. 
In essence, we are asking, although you may need to, 
of course, grant this motion to dismiss, I think because the 
court has shown sensitivity to victims and victims' needs, if 
there is a way to at least keep the record open so that victims 
who have not been able to be physically present in the 
courtroom today and who have not been able to submit to the 
court any letters, victim impact, and who have not been able to 
secure attorneys or speak to attorneys yet -- so, for example, 
I'll still hearing from victims who I have not been able to 
meet with yet because they just recently are now contacting 
me -- so if they could submit, at least for the record, their 
victim impact statements, that, I think, would be a very 
important assistance to them. So that would be, at least they 
would know that what they are sharing is on the record. 
So, in summary, I would say that they are looking 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
(212) 805-0300 
EFTA00020065
--- PAGE 73 ---
J8RsEPS3 
forward to the very serious investigation by the United States 
Attorney of who may have conspired in this case, and that is 
very hopeful, and we're hoping that everyone who may have a 
role to this criminal prosecution will submit that evidence. 
This is about power. This is about many victims 
having lived in fear -- fear of the rich, the powerful, the 
famous, fear that the system will not afford them justice. So 
fear of not coming forward. And fear, of course, is a weapon 
that the rich, powerful, famous, and sexual predators used to 
silence the victims. But that is gone for a lot of victims 
because they refuse to suffer in silence. 
Finally, it does take courage to speak truth to power. 
We thank this honorable court for giving these victims a voice. 
We thank them, even after the death of the defendant, for 
showing respect for the victims, allowing them dignity, 
allowing them a voice. We do want truth, we do want justice, 
we do want accountability, and we do want those conspirators to 
face the justice system. 
Your Honor, right now we have two of our clients who 
would like to address the court. 
THE COURT: Sure. 
MS. ALLRED: Then I have a couple of statements on 
victims who do not wish to address the court. 
As they come up, we'll give them the opportunity to

Hello. My name is 
That _5 
I was going to start this statement by saying that 1 
was a victim of Jeffrey Epstein. But that's not the case. I'm 
still a victim of Jeffrey Epstein. I'm still a victim because 
the fear of not being heard stopped me from telling my story 
for so many years. This lingering fear almost stopped me from 
attending this monumental movement of strength and power. 
I'm still a victim because I am fearful for my 
daughters and everyone's daughters. I'm fearful for their 
future in this world, where there are predators in power, a 
world where people can avoid justice if their pockets run deep 
enough. 
I'm still a victim because the 17-year-old 
was 
manipulated into thinking she had found someone who cared, 
someone who wanted to help. Jeffrey knew I had nowhere to go. 
He knew I was vulnerable, and he took advantage of that poor 
girl, who will never be the same. 
I cannot eat at the thought that Jeffrey Epstein -- _

cannot eat at the thought of Jeffrey Epstein not serving the 
time he needed to realize the pain and suffering he caused so 
many vulnerable young girls. He thought he was untouchable, 
and honestly, so did I. I thought he was the most powerful 
person I would ever meet. 
But the end is here and here I stand becoming more 
powerful than he will ever be. Thank you. 
THE COURT: Thank you. 
JANE DOE: Jane Doe. 
Um, in 2004, when I was 15 years old, I flew on 
Jeffrey Epstein's plane to Zorro Ranch, where I was sexual 
molested by him for many hours. What I remember most vividly 
was him explaining to me how beneficial the experience was for 
me and how much he was helping me to grow. Yikes. 
I remember feeling so small and powerless, especially 
after he positioned me by laying me on his floor so that I was 
confronted by all the framed photographs on his dresser of him 
smiling with wealthy celebrities and politicians. 
After he finished with me, he told me to describe in 
detail how good my first sexual experience felt. That was the 
first of many lies I was forced to carry for him, the weight of 
which proliferated my trauma. I felt powerless not merely 
because one man wanted to strip me of my innocence, but because 
I was the victim of a system that just enfranchises human 
beings, making them vulnerable to pedophilic exploitation.

As unjust as what happened to me was, I believe that 
experience to be a symptom of insidious and pathological 
violence that extreme wealth yields, a violence which 
ultimately stays hidden through channels of extreme power that 
serve it. 
I first identified with this feeling the night after I 
was molested by Epstein, when another girl and I took out two 
of his ATVs and raised them across the mesa. I crashed mine 
and expressed my concern to the other girl of getting in 
trouble, which she replied to me, Don't worry, no one gets in 
trouble for anything here. 
Even as a child, I understood, in a sad and precocious 
way, what I hoped we have the ability of changing now. Even 
though Epstein is dead, there is still justice to be brought 
for the crimes we felt powerless against concealing for him and 
the system that supported him for all these years. 
Thank you. 
THE COURT: You're very welcome. 
MS. ALLRED: Thank you. 
Your Honor, may it please the court. I would like to 
read a statement for Jane Doe, my client, who is present in 
court, but requested that I read it. 
We only have one opportunity at childhood. One 
opportunity to develop. One opportunity to find direction for 
our lives. Jeffrey Epstein robbed and denied me at each

opportunity he had. 
I came from a small Texas town, not far from the New 
Mexico border. My mother died when I was 11, after suffering 
from cancer for many years. My father was devastated, as were 
my siblings and I. My father was saddled with debt. My only 
hope for college was to get a scholarship. 
When I was 15, I was a blossoming freshman in high 
school and was trying to carry on my mother's dream. She 
wanted me to master the violin. After school, I would often go 
to a mall in a nearby city. A lady approached me and saw I had 
a violin case with me and asked if I was any good. We talked 
about the violin, my family, and why I had clothes that looked 
like hand-me-downs. 
The lady told me she works for a very rich man who had 
a home close by and that he would pay to hear me play. I was 
told that if I could get away, she could arrange for 
transportation to and from his place and have me back before 
anyone knew I was gone. After some hesitation, I agreed. This 
decision was the beginning of the end of my childhood. 
The man who only identified himself as J or Jeff had 
asked if I would give him a massage, and over four visits, 
eventually progressed 
The money he 
gave me further placed my young soul into a perverse sense of 
hell. 
I was so utterly disgusted with myself and what he did

to me that I stopped going to see him. I had documented the 
events with a Texas rape crisis center about the man I know now 
as Jeffrey Epstein. 
Epstein targeted and took advantage of me, a young 
girl, whose mother had recently died a horrific death and whose 
family structure had deteriorated. His actions placed me, a 
young girl, into a downward spiral to the point where I 
purchased a gun and drove myself to an isolated place to end my 
suffering. 
A voice that could only have been from my mother told 
me, quote, I am not the victim, I am the victor, and I dare not 
pull the trigger." I returned the gun days later. 
Epstein is a coward. He lived his life leaching off 
the souls of inspiring, young girls due to the fact that he 
could never know how it feels inspired to live. Like a leach, 
once Epstein had his fill, he would unlatch and seek out 
another victim. 
The only sense of justice I had hoped to see was 
Epstein being sentenced. However, Epstein died as he lived, 
taking the easy way out without any responsibility. 
Your Honor, the next statement is also a statement of 
a Jane Doe. May it please the court. 
I was a 16-year-old virgin when Jeffrey Epstein first 
raped me. I was naive and gullable. He was a pillar of 
finance and a giant in the world that I was an insignificant

part of. I was so impressed that this great man would even 
talk to me and impart any of his wisdom on me. I gladly jumped 
at the chance to meet him again, when he told me how impressed 
he was with my personal story and maturity for my age. 
When I was in his presence, he made an effort to call 
celebrities and influential people on speakerphone, like 
Academy Award-winning actresses and super models, who always 
answered his calls. Sadly, I was impressed. 
He was friends with former and future heads of states 
and every other fixture in the New York social scene and 
beyond. He knew important people in my own world that I looked 
up to and revered, but he spoke about them like they were sweet 
distractions far beneath his stature. He could easily reach 
down from his position and influence the people directly 
involved with my daily life and future prosperity. I was the 
perfect victim. 
My whole life was extremely turbulent. But one of my 
mother's greatest wishes was that all her children would 
graduate from respectable universities. He promised me that he 
would write me a letter of recommendation for Harvard if I got 
the grades and scores needed for admission. His word was worth 
a lot, he assured me, as he was in the midst of funding and 
leading Harvard's studies on the human brain, and the president 
was his friend. 
The fact that all of you already know these next

details, which I'll share, should ignite fire instead of induce 
the complacency they did in the past, when heard repeatedly 
over the years, but yes, an innocent massage turned sexual

and a couple 
of hundred dollars, disgust and dirty secret, more praise and 
imparted wisdom from a godlike figure, a deliberate diabolical 
depression of grooming and submission for his pleasure and 
release. Even if I resisted, I was no match for him. I felt 
powerless, ashamed, and embarrassed. I wanted to vomit 
remembering these moments. 
What I learned in those depraved sessions, staring up 
at the dome ceiling in his private massage room, tore a violent 
hole through any normal sexual awakening. I'm haunted forever, 
having learned everything there is to know about sex through a 
vile criminal. Every time a new molestation would bring a new 
lesson, the progressive and constant unwinding. I was nothing 
more than a teenage prostitute. I was his slave. 
I had never even kissed a boy before I met him, and 
never throughout the horrific abuse did Jeffrey Epstein kiss me 
even once.

I got a few hundred dollars, as usual, as he led me 
out of his mansion with assurances that I was on the right path 
guided by him. I lied to myself and tried to believe him. I 
became a hollow shell. If I missed an appointment, he 
threatened me

and let

me know who was in charge. "Do you know 
is? I'll bury you. I owe this -- I 
F'ing town." He would hang up. 
I would stand there frozen in the street, terrified 
that his assistant would call to reschedule. I made sure to 
stay in line and not disobey him. I was in complete denial. 
Being paid after every scheduled meeting felt routine and 
disgusting. He was the master of the universe and the world 
bent to his will. 
He would eventually brag to his assistants about my 
ability to please him sexually right in front of me, leaving me 
feeling grotesque and worthless. Everything in my outside life 
was falling apart. I distanced myself from friends and grew 
further away from my family. I felt less human after each 
ordeal. My psyche broke down completely and wouldn't let me 
continue.

One day I walked out of his residence and passed a 
girl similar to myself. When I turned around, she was entering 
Jeffrey's residence. He no longer even tried to schedule his 
appointments with other girls in secrecy from me. Maybe he 
never did. I was too stupid to see. 
My world shattered. I had been so naive. I had an 
epiphany in a calvary of desperation. I realized I was just 
one of many young girls he had in rotation come to perform for 
him for money. I went into a deep depression and never lifted 
completely. I wanted to inflict pain on myself. I was 
humiliated, angry, and suicidal. I locked myself away from 
everything. I cut myself off forever from the world I had 
known. 
I endured the daily agony of knowing my life would 
never be the same. I could never go back to New York City and 
the wonderful life I had taken for granted before I met this 
demon named Jeffrey Epstein. 
This creature had manipulated and outwitted the whole 
system, including some of the most intelligent scientists, 
political people, prosecutors, and power players. How easy was 
it to manipulate a 16-year-old virgin who never had a boyfriend 
and came from a background of hardship with no parental 
guidance or support. 
I went to therapy and was given antidepressants for 
severe anxiety and depression. My only solace, years later,

was my desire to succeed on my own terms. I emersed myself 
into my studies and was accepted to every college I applied to, 
graduating from a top university. To this day, there is still 
an ache in my being that I did not apply to Harvard in fear of 
his influence there. 
They say you never forget your first. I'm in a 
never-ending nightmare trying to do just that. I'm forever 
suffering because everything reminds me of that horror. This 
new wave of worldwide publicity only worsens my despair. 
It was only many years later that I was finally 
intimate with a man again, and those moments were marred by my 
actions as a child with Jeffrey Epstein. Even now is 
impossible to separate his treachery from any care of a good 
man. 
For one brief moment there was elation when he was 
recently arrested. I would finally get my chance to see him 
again face to face and show him what I had become, that I had 
succeeded on my own, that I was worth something in spite of his 
abuse, and that I had surmounted the monumental obstacles he 
laid before me throughout my entire life since falling prey to 
him. 
I had hoped humanity would prevail, but it seems to me 
that he outsmarted everyone so far, and his ghost is still 
laughing at us. I appeal to all of those just and true that 
his evil legacy and his death not stand in the way of

resolution and justice for all of his underaged victims. 
Thank you, your Honor. 
And then just one last one, and this is much shorter. 
Statement of Jane Doe, also my client. 
I was a model in another country when I came to the 
United States. I was told by a booker that I needed to meet 
with a man named Jeffrey Epstein, who was the owner of 
Victoria's Secret. The booker told me that Mr. Epstein could 
help me get into Victoria Secret's world. 
It was my childhood dream to be a Victoria's Secret 
model. So I went one day in the afternoon and I met 
Mr. Epstein in his office in his mansion in New York. A woman 
introduced herself and suggested to me that I should be 
extremely nice to Mr. Epstein, because if he liked me, he would 
probably have photographers shooting photos of me right away. 
The told me to go upstairs and directed me to Jeffrey 
Epstein's office. Mr. Epstein had a white robe on and we 
chatted very briefly. I had my portfolio of photos, but he 
didn't even look at it. Suddenly, he took his robe off and got 
close to me. I got up to leave, but the door was locked. 
I didn't know what was going on. It was my first 
official meeting to be cast in the United States. I was a 
young girl and confused. He got very close to me, and I had a 
skirt on. 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
(212) 805-0300 
EFTA00020077
--- PAGE 85 ---
J8RsEPS3 
At that point, I ran to the door again and figured out 
how to get out of there. A girl outside asked me where I was 
going and she said to be careful. She said that Mr. 'kpstein 
knew a lot of powerful people, including Bill Clinton, and that 
if I didn't do what Mr. Epstein wanted, I would not be able to 
have any job in the industry. 
I was so scared. I couldn't wait to get out of there, 
and I left. I took the train home. I had spent all of my 
savings getting Victoria's Secret lingerie to prepare for what 
I thought would be my audition. But instead, it seemed like a 
casting call for prostitution. I felt like I was in hell. 
Thank you, your Honor. 
Thank you. 
THE COURT: Thank you, Ms. Allred. 
Was there anybody else, any victim's counsel or any of 
the other victims who have not been heard and wish to be heard? 
Well, OK then. All I have to say, really, is thank 
you, all of you, for your participation in today's remarkable 
hearing. I think everybody has benefited greatly from your 
input, and especially from the testimony of victims here today 
and who have had the courage to come forward. 
We have also benefited throughout these proceedings, 
however brief altogether, from the attorneys' legal advocacy 
and their written and oral submissions. I'm grateful to them

U.S. Department of Justice 
United States Attorney 
Southern District of New York 
The Si/viol. Mollo Building 
One Saint Andrew's Plaza 
New York, New York 10007 
August 28, 2019 
By ECF and E-Mail 
Honorable Richard M. Berman 
United States District Judge 
Southern District of New York 
500 Pearl Street 
New York, New York 10007 
Re: 
United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 (RMB) 
Dear Judge Berman: 
The Government respectfully writes in response to legal arguments raised by defense counsel 
at the August 27, 2019 hearing on the Government's nolle prosequi motion. As set forth below, 
the Court must dismiss the Indictment where, as here, the defendant has died prior to a conviction 
becoming final. Moreover, the Court does not have the authority, inherent or otherwise, to conduct 
its own inquiry into the circumstances of Jeffrey Epstein's suicide, or to supervise the ongoing 
Grand Jury investigation. 
1. The Rule of Abatement Requires the Dismissal of the Indictment 
As the Court is aware, clear Second Circuit precedent requires the dismissal of an 
indictment when a defendant dies before his conviction becomes final, under the "well-settled rule 
that actions upon penal statutes do not survive the death of the wrongdoer." United States v. 
Wright, 160 F.3d 905, 908 (2d Cir. 1998) (internal citation omitted). This rule applies with full 
force here, and requires the dismissal of the Indictment. See Transcript of Aug. 27, 2019 Hearing 
("Tr.") at 9 (Court noting that "it is appropriate to conclude that if the rule of abatement applies to 
a convicted defendant as in the Wright case, it should also apply a fortiori in the Epstein case, 
which was still in the pretrial phase when Mr. Epstein died, when there had been no conviction."); 
see also United States v. Brooks, 872 F.3d 78, 87 (2d Cir. 2017), cert. denied, 139 S. Ct. 171, 202 
L. Ed. 2d 37 (2018) ("This general rule, almost unanimously followed by the federal Courts of 
Appeals, has its roots in the common law doctrine of abatement ab initio: `everything associated 
with the case is extinguished, leaving the defendant as if he had never been indicted or 
convicted.") (collecting cases). 
2. The Court Does Not Have the Authority to Conduct its Own Investigation 
At yesterday's hearing, defense counsel posited that the "court has the inherent authority 
to find out what happened on its watch," and asked the Court to "supervis[e], or at least keep an 
EFTA00020085
--- PAGE 2 ---
Page 2 
interest in these proceeding[s]." (Tr. 17-18). Defense counsel is wrong. The Court lacks the 
constitutional authority to supervise a grand jury investigation or to appoint an independent 
prosecutor to investigate the circumstances surrounding Epstein's death. The only power the 
Constitution permits to be vested in federal judges is "[t]he judicial power of the United States," 
Art. III, § 1, which is the power to decide, in accordance with law, who should prevail in a case or 
controversy, see Art. III, § 2. That power does not include "'supervisory' authority" over the grand 
jury—"an institution separate from the courts, over whose functioning the courts do not preside." 
United States v. Williams, 504 U.S. 36, 45-46 (1992); see also United States v. Dionisio, 410 U.S. 
I, 17-18 (1973) (holding that the grand jury must remain "free to pursue its investigations 
unhindered by external influence or supervision so long as it does not trench upon the legitimate 
rights of any witness called before it."). To allow a court to supervise a grand jury's investigation 
would also likely conflict with the Fifth Amendment's constitutional guarantee of "an investigative 
body acting independently of either prosecuting attorney or judge."' Williams, 504 U.S. at 49 
(quoting Dionisio, 410 U.S. at 16). 
The court's judicial power also "does not include the power to seek out law violators in 
order to punish them" and, accordingly, it is "well established that the judicial power does not 
generally include the power to prosecute crimes." Young v. U.S. a rel. Vuitton et Fils S.A., 481 
U.S. 787, 816-17 (1987) (Scalia, J., concurring) (citing United States v. Cox, 342 F.2d 167 (5th 
Cir. 1965), and United States v. Thompson, 251 U.S. 407, 413-17 (1920)). Rather, the Constitution 
vests the power to conduct investigations and prosecute violations of the laws in the Executive. 
See Art. II, § 2, cl. 1; Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 832 (1985); Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. I, 
138 (1976). Indeed, the Second Circuit has emphasized that judicial review and regulation of 
prosecutorial decisions would place courts in the "injudicious posture of becoming 
`superprosecutors,"' and would invite questions about "the judiciary's role of supervision," 
including "[a]t what point would the prosecutor be entitled to call a halt to further investigation," 
"[w]hat evidentiary standard would be used." Inmates of Attica Corr. Facility v. Rockefeller, 477 
F.2d 375, 380 (2d Cir. 1973) (discussing action to require federal officials to investigate and 
prosecute persons who had allegedly violated criminal statutes). 
For those reasons, among many, a judge's authority to initiate a proceeding and appoint an 
attorney to conduct an investigation has been circumscribed by Congress and the Supreme Court. 
Only when a court order has been disobeyed does a court "possess inherent authority to initiate 
contempt proceedings." Young, 481 U.S. at 793. But, even in the unique context of criminal 
contempt—which is not at issue here—a court only has authority to appoint a private lawyer to 
prosecute the contempt where the United States Attorney has refused the prosecution. See Fed. R. 
Crim. P. 42(a)(2). 
The precedent cited by defense counsel—the special proceeding initiated by Judge Emmett 
Sullivan following the dismissal of the prosecution of Senator Ted Stevens—provides no authority 
for the exercise of the court's power here. See In re Special Proceeding, Misc. No. 09-0198 (EGS). 
In that case, after the Department of Justice dismissed the charges against Senator Stevens for 
apparent Brady violations, Judge Sullivan, pursuant to Rule 42, appointed a special prosecutor to 
investigate the violations. See United States v. Stevens, No. 08 Cr. 231 (EGS) (Apr. 8, 2009) (Dkt. 
No. 375); Reporter's Transcript of Proceedings, United States v. Stevens, No. 08 Cr. 231 (EGS), 
EFTA00020086
--- PAGE 3 ---
Page 3 
at 46-47 (Apr. 7, 2009). But here, there is no allegation of disobedience of court order that would 
give the court authority to initiate a proceeding under Rule 42, or appoint a private attorney. 
Finally, it bears noting that the United States Attorney's Office, Federal Bureau of 
Investigation, and Department of Justice — Office of Inspector General are conducting an ongoing 
Grand Jury investigation into the circumstances surrounding Epstein's August 10, 2019 suicide. 
A separate investigation would likely, at best, be redundant and may risk undermining the existing 
investigation. 
Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, we respectfully request that the Court grant 
Government's nolle prosequi motion. 
Very truly yours, 
GEOFFREY S. BERMAN

Hi all, 
Will you be able to gather the responsive documents for Glassman's request, as with the request from Kaplan? Except for 
Item 8, this request seems fairly contained—and they have expressly cabined their request to not seek documents that 
would interfere with ongoing proceedings. Please let me know if we need to discuss. Otherwise, I'll draft a letter once we 
have the dots gathered (happy to do redactions again if helpful). 
Thanks,

Re: 
Request for Tangible and Documentary Evidence (Touhy Request) 
Jane Doe v. Indyke et al., SDNY Case No. 1:20-cv-00484-JGK-DCF 
Dear Mr. 
Please be advised that we represent the plaintiff in the above-referenced litigation who is 
hereby submitting this written request for documentary and tangible evidence relating to the U.S. 
Government's investigation concerning Jeffrey E. Epstein's repeated acts of sexual abuse against 
our client, Jane Doe.' See United States a rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951). We 
believe that such evidence is currently in the possession, custody and control of the Department 
of Justice ("DOJ") and are highly relevant to Doe's above-referenced civil matter. 
This written request is submitted pursuant to 28 C.F.R. § 16.21 et seq., known 
colloquially as the "Touhy" regulations. Because this request is directed to DOJ employees, 
compliance is subject to the Touhy process, and for that reason we have not affected formal 
service of process and hope that it will be unnecessary. 
Summary of Information Sought and its Relevance to the Proceeding 
Doe's civil case arises out of years of sexual abuse and exploitation by notorious 
pedophile and convicted sex offender Jeffrey E. Epstein. It all started in 1994 when 13-year-old 
Doe met Epstein at a summer camp in Michigan. Doe was Epstein's first known victim and was 
To protect her anonymity, our client has elected to file her action as a Jane Doe and will be 
referred to simply as "Doe" in this letter. The prosecutors handling the Epstein case and any and 
all related ongoing investigations in your office, however, are aware of our client's true identity.

subsequently abused by Epstein for years as a young girl, suffering unimaginable physical and 
psychological trauma and distress. 
The United States ultimately investigated and brought charges against Jeffrey E. Epstein 
for sexual abuse of minors and violations of federal law. We believe the government's 
investigation spanned several years and collected copious amounts of information and 
documents regarding Jeffrey E. Epstein and his victims, including Doe. 
As summarized below, we request the production of documentary and tangible evidence 
relating to Doe which was obtained during the government's investigation of Epstein and that is 
currently in the government's possession. This evidence is highly relevant to Doe's civil case as 
it will likely provide information regarding Epstein's liability and Doe's significant damages. 
Specifically, we seek copies of the following documents currently in the possession of the 
government: 
1. 
All photographs of Doe 
2. 
All flight logs stating Doe's name 
3. 
All videos of Doe 
4. 
All correspondences between Epstein and his agents, employees and/or attorneys 
and Doe 
5. 
All records of purchases of airline tickets on behalf of Doe 
6. 
Jeffrey E. Epstein's Trust Agreement of The 1953 Trust dated August 8, 2019 
7. 
Jeffrey E. Epstein's Epstein's 1953 Trust 
8. 
Any and all other documentary materials relating in any way to Doe 
Disclosure is \\ di-ranted Under 28 C.F.R. & 16.26 
Pursuant to the DOJ's Torthy regulations, the Deputy or Associate Attorney General 
assesses the following considerations in determining whether disclosure is warranted:

BOYLE, ,, 
(a)(1) Whether such disclosure is appropriate under the rules of procedure governing the 
case or mater in which the demand arose; 
(a)(2) Whether disclosure is appropriate under the relevant substantive law of privilege. 
This request satisfies both of these considerations. As explained previously, the requested 
non-privileged documentary evidence directly concerns the allegations in Doe's civil case. 
Additionally, DOD's Toithy regulations prohibit disclosure, subject to certain exceptions, 
if any of the following factors exist: 
(b)(1) Disclosure would violate a statute, such as the income tax laws, 26 U.S.C.A. 6103 
and 7213, or a rule of procedure, such as the grand jury secrecy rule, F.R.Cr.P., Rule 6(e), 
(b)(2) Disclosure would violate a specific regulation; 
(b)(3) Disclosure would reveal classified information, unless appropriately declassified 
by the originating agency, 
(b)(4) Disclosure would reveal a confidential source or informant, unless the investigative 
agency and the source or informant have no objection, 
(b)(5) Disclosure would reveal investigatory records compiled for law enforcement 
purposes, and would interfere with enforcement proceedings or disclose investigative techniques 
and procedures the effectiveness of which would thereby be impaired, 
(b)(6) Disclosure would improperly reveal trade secrets without the owner's consent. 
This request does not implicate any of the above considerations. The requested 
information is within the scope of ordinary subpoena practice and does not seek disclosure of 
information prohibited by statute or regulation, nor information that is classified or that would 
reveal the source of an informant. 
To the extent any of Doe's requests seek the investigatory records compiled for law 
enforcement purposes, Doe does not request investigatory records that would interfere with 
ongoing enforcement proceedings.

Doe's civil case is actively being litigated and the parties have already requested and

Dear Counsel: 
Pursuant to Judge Nathan's Order of September 3, 2021 (Dkt. No. 335), the Government 
writes to inform you that it may refer at trial to the following individuals as co-conspirators of the 
defendant, including for the purpose of Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E): 
• 
Jeffre E stein 
• 
• 
, formerly known as 
The Government has produced all co-conspirator statements which it intends to offer at 
trial pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E) in the Government's production today or in its previous 
productions. To the extent the Government learns of additional co-conspirator statements as it 
continues to prepare for trial, it will produce those statements in connection with its ongoing 
obligation to produce Jencks Act material. 
EFTA00020105
--- PAGE 2 ---

Please be advised that the above list is limited to the individuals the Government may refer 
to as co-conspirators at trial. While the Government makes no representations as to whether it 
views other individuals as potential or actual co-conspirators of the defendant, it does not intend 
to refer to any other individuals as co-conspirators at trial. The above list is also not intended to 
reflect a complete list of individuals who may be referenced at trial. That information is contained 
in the Government's Jencks Act production(s). 
Please note that this letter and the information contained herein is governed by the July 31,

Parvin, 
That makes good sense, thanks. Because of the scheduling issues I mentioned, we'd like to set it for a time in early 
September, if we can — is there a time during the afternoon of September 5 or the morning of September 6 that would 
work for you? We should be able to do either of those dates and times. Or if not, we can propose possible times the 
following week.

Could you please let us know what format we should expect in terms of the proffer? That will help us with figuring out 
scheduling. I.e., do you expect to make an attorney proffer in the first instance, or should be expect to be meeting with 
Deutsche Bank personnel, etc? And approximately how long should we be planning to block out?

Hi 
The proffer may be helpful in guiding you through the production. That said, we can be available whenever makes most 
sense on your ends. 
We have time this week (Thursday or Friday afternoon) and next week (Monday — Wednesday), and we have time in 
September. If you give us a few options in terms of dates/times, we will sort out schedules on our ends.

We received the index, thank you. In terms of a proffer, what generally did you have in mind regarding timing? I think 
we'd like to have some time with the subpoena returns to get familiarized, and our team has a combination of travel and 
trials in the next couple weeks, but we could do early September if that works on your end. Thoughts?

Hi 
Following up on our meeting yesterday, attached is the updated spreadsheet of all identified victims and noting which 
ones have been contacted. Would you please review this with the FBI victim specialists to note any additional contact 
with victims since Epstein's death? And if there are still any victims in this spreadsheet who have not been contacted 
since Epstein's death, would you please attempt to contact them and make a note of those attempts in the spreadsheet? 
Give me a call if you have any questions, and thanks so much for your help with this.

Marty, 
I got your voicemail from this morning regarding follow-up on civil forfeiture—we have a meeting at 12:30 that I expect 
will go approximately 15 minutes and will plan to give you (or Mike, to conference you in) a call after that, so 
approximately around 12:45 — 1:00. 
Separately, based on the expected nolle order, and in connection with the protective order in this case, in advance of the 
hearing on Tuesday can you please either return to the Government all discovery you received in this case and certify that 
any copies have been security destroyed or deleted, or, alternatively, simply certify that all discovery received has been 
security destroyed or deleted? (As to the second option, that is to say that you do not need to make additional copies of 
electronic materials to formally "return" them to us if it is more efficient to simply delete and destroy the existing 
electronic copies you have.) We want to be able to advise the Court on Tuesday that there are no outstanding discovery 
obligations on either side based in connection with the protective order. 
Thank you,

ATTACHMENT A 
I. The Subject Devices to Be Searched 
The Subject Devices arc particularly described as compact discs stored in containers 
marked with FBI evidence numbers 15, 16, 17, 18, and 22, seized from the residence located at 9 
East 71st Street, New York, New York, on or about July 7, 2019. 
II. Items to Be Seized 
A. Evidence, Fruits, and Instrumentalities of the Subject Offenses 
This warrant authorizes the seizure of certain evidence, fruits, and instrumentalities of 
violations of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1591 (sex trafficking of minors), and 371 (sex 
trafficking conspiracy) (the "Subject Offenses") described as follows: 
1. 
Any documents or communications with or regarding victims or potential victims 
of the Subject Offenses; 
2. 
Any photographs of victims or potential victims of the Subject Offenses; 
3. 
Any nude, partially nude, or sexually suggestive photographs of individuals who 
appear to be teenage girls, or younger; 
4. 
Motion pictures, films, videos, and other recordings of visual or written depictions 
of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct, as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 2256(2); 
5. 
Records or other items that evidence ownership, control, or use of, or access to 
devices, storage media, and related electronic equipment used to access, transmit, or store 
information relating to the Subject Offenses, including, but not limited to, sales receipts, 
warranties, bills for Internet access, handwritten notes, registry entries, configuration files, saved 
usemames and passwords, user profiles, e-mail contacts, and photographs; 
6. 
Any child erotica, defined as suggestive visual depictions of nude minors that do 
not constitute child pornography as defined by 18 U.S.C. § 2256(8). 
B. Review of ESI 
Law enforcement personnel (including, in addition to law enforcement officers and agents, 
and depending on the nature of the ESI and the status of the investigation and related proceedings, 
attorneys for the government, attorney support staff, agency personnel assisting the government in 
this investigation, and outside technical experts under government control) will create a forensic 
image of the Subject Devices (if practicable) and review the ESI contained therein for information 
responsive to the warrant. 
In conducting this review, law enforcement personnel may use various techniques to 
determine which files or other EST contain evidence or fruits of the Subject Offenses. Such 
techniques may include, for example: 
2017.08.02 
EFTA00020132
--- PAGE 4 ---
• surveying directories or folders and the individual files they contain (analogous to 
looking at the outside of a file cabinet for the markings it contains and opening a drawer 
believed to contain pertinent files); 
• conducting a file-by-file review by "opening" or reading the first few "pages" of such 
files in order to determine their precise contents (analogous to performing a cursory 
examination of each document in a file cabinet to determine its relevance); 
• "scanning" storage areas to discover and possibly recover recently deleted data or 
deliberately hidden files; and 
• performing electronic keyword searches through all electronic storage areas to 
determine the existence and location of data potentially related to the subject matter of 
the investigation6; and 
• reviewing metadata, system information, configuration files, registry data, and any 
other information reflecting how, when, and by whom the computer was used. 
Law enforcement personnel will make reasonable efforts to search only for files, 
documents, or other electronically stored information within the categories identified in Section 
II.A of this Attachment. However, law enforcement personnel are authorized to conduct a 
complete review of all the ESI from seized devices or storage media if necessary to evaluate its 
contents and to locate all data responsive to the warrant. 
Keyword searches alone are typically inadequate to detect all relevant data. For one thing, 
keyword searches work only for text data, yet many types of files, such as images and videos, do 
not store data as searchable text. Moreover, even as to text data, there may be information properly 
subject to seizure but that is not captured by a keyword search because the information does not 
contain the keywords being searched.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
VIRGIN ISLANDS 
In the Matter of the Application of the United 
States Of America for a Search and Seizure 
Warrant for the Premises Known and Described 
as Little Saint James Island, U.S. Virgin Islands, 
Any Buildings or Other Structures Contained 
Thereon, 
and 
Any 
Locked 
or 
Closed 
Containers/Items Contained Therein 
TO BE FILED UNDER SEAL 
Agent Affidavit in Support of 
Application for Search and Seizure 
Warrant 
DISTRICT OF THE VIRGIN ISLANDS) ss.: 
being duly sworn, deposes and says: 
I. Introduction 
A. Affiant 
I. 
I have been a Special Agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI") since 
2017. As such, I am a "federal law enforcement office?' within the meaning of Federal Rule of 
Criminal Procedure 41(a)(2)(C), that is, a government agent engaged in enforcing the criminal 
laws and duly authorized by the Attorney General to request a search warrant. I have been 
employed by the FBI for approximately two years, and I am currently assigned to investigate 
violations of criminal law relating to the sexual exploitation of children. I have gained expertise 
in this area through classroom training and daily work related to these types of investigations. As 
part of my responsibilities, I have been involved in the investigation of sex trafficking cases, and 
have participated in the execution of search warrants for physical premises. 
2. 
I make this Affidavit in support of an application pursuant to Rule 41 of the Federal 
Rules of Criminal Procedure for a warrant to search the premises specified below (the "Subject 
Premises") for the purpose of seizing the items and information described in Attachment A. This 
affidavit is based upon my personal knowledge; my review of documents and other evidence; and 
my conversations with other law enforcement personnel. Because this affidavit is being submitted 
2017.08.02 
EFTA00020141
--- PAGE 2 ---
for the limited purpose of establishing probable cause, it does not include all the facts that I have 
learned during the course of my investigation. Where the contents of documents and the actions, 
statements, and conversations of others are reported herein, they are reported in substance and in 
part, except where otherwise indicated. 
B. The Subject Premises 
3. 
The Subject Premises are particularly described as a private island in the U.S. 
Virgin Islands, known as Little Saint James, any buildings or other structures contained thereon, 
and any closed containers/items contained therein. Little Saint James is an approximately 75 acre 
island located approximately four miles off the southeast coast of St. Thomas Island. The Subject 
Premises is depicted in the following photograph: 
Based on my conversations with a law enforcement agent who has reviewed publicly available 
satellite information, images, and drone videos, I am aware that the Subject Premises contains 
multiple structures, including but not limited to: 
2017.08.02 
EFTA00020142
--- PAGE 3 ---
a. 
On the northeast end of the Subject Premises, there is a single story structure next to 
a pool. 
b. 
On the southwest end of the Subject Premises, there is a single-story, four-wall 
structure. The walls are painted with blue and white stripes. The structure has large double doors 
as its main entrance and large windows on the three remaining walls. 
c. 
On the north east end of the Subject Premises, there are multiple structures. The 
main structure is a single story residence (the "Main Residence") with a stone exterior, a blue roof, 
and a white detailed exterior that includes white columns. 
d. 
A separate structure ("Residence One") with a blue roof and stone exterior is at the 
back of the Main Residence, located at the end of the northeast tip of the island and surrounded by 
coastline on two of its sides. 
e. 
A second larger structure ("Residence Two) is set between the Main Residence and 
the coastline. 
f. 
Four smaller single story structures (the "Four Cabanas") are next to the Main 
Residence and a large pool. All four smaller structures have blue roofs. 
A third large structure ("Residence Three") set off from the four smaller structures 
and next to the coast line is painted white and has a blue roof. Residence Three appears to have 
two levels throughout and also appears to be at a lower elevation than the Main Residence, 
Residence Two, and the Four Cabanas. 
h. 
Behind Residence Three and along the coastline is a small roofed structure at the 
end of a wooden dock (the "Dock House"). 
2017.08.02 
EFTA00020143
--- PAGE 4 ---
i. 
There are two single story sheds ("Shed One" and "Shed Two") that are located just 
southwest of the Main Residence. Shed One and Shed Two appear to have a metal-like exterior 
that is a green-blue color. 
j. 
Next to Shed One and Shed Two is a four wall structure that appears to have several 
sally port type doors ("Maintenance One"). A second structure ("Maintenance Two") is next to 
Maintenance One and has a white exterior with four sets of white double doors and three single 
white doors. 
k. 
Near the center of the island is a single story structure ("Residence Four") that has a 
stone exterior and blue roof. The front of "Residence Four" has three dark double doors. 
I. 
Next to the helicopter landing pad are two small blue roof structures ("Helipad 
Buildings"). 
m. 
On the west side of the Subject Premises on the coast is an approximately two-level 
structure ("Residence Five") with a blue roof. 
4. 
As detailed further herein, at least through his death on August 10, 2019, the Subject 
Premises was believed to be owned, possessed, and controlled by JEFFREY EPSTEIN. 
C. The Target Subject and the Subject Offenses 
5. 
For the reasons detailed below, I believe that there is probable cause to believe that 
the Subject Premises contain evidence, fruits, and instrumentalities of violations of Title 18, United 
States Code, Sections 1591 (sex trafficking of minors), and 371 (sex trafficking conspiracy) (the 
"Subject Offenses") . The Target Subjects of this investigation are known and unknown co-
conspirators of JEFFREY EPSTEIN, including but not limited to 
2017.08.02 
EFTA00020144
--- PAGE 5 ---
II. Probable Cause and the Initial Search Warrants 
A. Probable Cause Regarding the Target Subject's Commission of the 
Subject Offenses 
6. 
On or about July 2, 2019, a grand jury in this Southern District of New York 
returned an Indictment charging JEFFREY EPSTEIN with violations of Title 18, United States 
Code, Section 1591 (sex trafficking of minors); and Title 18, United States Code, Section 371 (sex 
trafficking conspiracy). A copy of the Indictment is attached hereto as Exhibit A and is 
incorporated by reference. EPSTEIN was arrested pursuant to the Indictment on or about July 6, 
2019, and had been detained pending trial at the Metropolitan Correctional Center ("MCC") in 
New York, New York. 
7. 
On or about August 10, 2019, the Bureau of Prisons confirmed that JEFFREY 
EPSTEIN had been found unresponsive in his cell at the MCC that morning, and was pronounced 
dead shortly thereafter. 
8. 
Notwithstanding EPSTEIN's death, the sex trafficking investigation that led to his 
indictment remains ongoing. In particular, Count One of the Indictment alleged that EPSTEIN 
conspired with others to traffic minors, and further identified three individuals who worked for 
EPSTEIN (identified in Exhibit A as "Employee-1", "Employee-2," and "Employee-3") and 
facilitated EPSTEIN's abuse of minor girls by, among other things, arranging victims' encounters 
with EPSTEIN and paying victims after these encounters. The individual identified in Exhibit A 
as "Employee-2" is 
a target subject of this investigation. 
9. 
As set forth in Exhibit A, from at least in or about 2002, up to and including at least 
in or about 2005, JEFFREY EPSTEIN sexually abused multiple minor girls in Manhattan, New 
York; West Palm Beach, Florida; and elsewhere. During that time and continuing to the present, 
2017.08.02 
EFTA00020145
--- PAGE 6 ---
EPSTEIN possessed and controlled a residence, which is described in Exhibit A as "the New York 
Residence." 
10. 
As further set forth in paragraphs 8 through 10 of Exhibit A, from at least in or about 
2002, up to and including at least in or about 2005, EPSTEIN sexually abused numerous minor 
victims at the New York Residence. In particular, and as alleged in the Indictment, when a victim 
arrived at the New York Residence, she would be escorted to a room inside the New York 
Residence with a massage table, where she would perform a massage on EPSTEIN. The victims, 
who were as young as 14 years of age, were told by EPSTEIN or other individuals to partially or 
fully undress before beginning the "massage." During the encounter, EPSTEIN would escalate 
the nature and scope of physical contact with his victim to include, among other things, sex acts 
such as 
EPSTEIN typically

Following each 
encounter, EPSTEIN or one of his employees or associates paid the victim in cash. 
I I. 
As set forth in paragraphs 12 through 13 of Exhibit A, to further facilitate his ability 
to abuse minor girls in New York, JEFFREY EPSTEIN asked and enticed certain of his victims to 
recruit additional minor girls to perform "massages" and similarly engage in sex acts with 
EPSTEIN. When a victim would recruit another minor girl for EPSTEIN, he paid both the victim-
recruiter and the new victim hundreds of dollars in cash. EPSTEIN knew that his victims were 
underage, including because certain victims told him their age. 
12. 
One of the victims identified in paragraph 22 of Exhibit A is Victim-1. As part of 
the FBI's investigation of EPSTEIN, I have participated in interviews with Victim-1, along with 
2017.08.02 
EFTA00020146

other law enforcement officers.' 
Based on my participation in those interviews and my 
conversations with other law enforcement officers, I know that Victim-1 has provided the 
following information, in substance and in part: 
a. Between approximately 2002 and 2005, EPSTEIN sexually abused Victim-1 on 
multiple occasions in the New York Residence. This sexual abuse all occurred when Victim-I 
was under the age of 18. 
b. During that same period, Victim-1 observed multiple floors of the New York 
Residence and numerous individual rooms within the New York Residence. Victim-I has 
provided detailed descriptions of certain aspects of the interior of the Subject Premises, including 
Victim-I's memory of specific details regarding the layout, furnishings, decorations, and floor 
pattern of various areas within the Subject Premises. Among other details, Victim-1 recalled that 
EPSTEIN typically abused her in a room she described as a "massage room," (the "Massage 
Room"), which contained a massage table, and was decorated with artwork depicting naked 
women, hung on walls that appeared to be adorned with fabric. In describing the sexual abuse that 
occurred in the Massage Room, Victim-1 has stated that EPSTEIN would often

13. 
On or about July 6, 2019, the Honorable Barbara Moses, United States Magistrate 
Judge, signed a search warrant authorizing a search of the New York Residence. The search 
warrant is attached as Exhibit B and incorporated by reference herein. 
14. 
At approximately 6 p.m. on or about July 6, 2019, law enforcement officers (the 
"Search Team") commenced executing the search warrant at the New York Residence. JEFFREY 
EPSTEIN had been arrested on the charges contained in the Indictment shortly before the 
execution of the search warrant. Based on the Search Team's observations during an initial search 
of the New York Residence, at approximately 7 p.m., the Search Team stopped the search and 
froze the scene in order to seek a new search warrant. On or about July 7, 2019, the Honorable 
Barbara Moses, United States Magistrate Judge, signed a search warrant authorizing a search of 
the New York Residence (the "Second Warrant"). The Second Warrant is attached as Exhibit C, 
and incorporated by reference herein. At approximately 2:30 a.m., the Search Team resumed the 
search, and commenced searching pursuant to the Second Warrant. Later on July 7, 2019, the 
Honorable Barbara Moses, United States Magistrate Judge, signed a third search warrant to search 
and seize certain electronic media stored on discs seized during the execution of the Second 
Warrant (the "Compact Disc Search Warrant"). The search warrant is attached as Exhibit D, and 
incorporated by reference herein. 
15. 
During the execution of the warrants described above on the New York Residence, 
the Search Team located evidence of the Subject Offenses. In particular, the Search Team located 
the following, among other items: 
c. 
Inside the Subject Premises, I observed a room that, based on my participation in 
interviews of Victim-1, appears to be consistent with Victim-1's descriptions of the Massage 
Room. The room contained a table covered with a sheet, and appeared to be a massage table. The 
2017.08.02 
EFTA00020148
--- PAGE 9 ---
room also contained several vibrating sex toys. The walls appeared to be covered in a type of felt-
like tapestry fabric. I further observed two paintings and three photographs hanging on the walls 
of the Massage Room. The paintings and photographs depict nude females. One of the 
photographs appears to depict a nude girl. Thus, it appears that the Massage Room was in 
substantially the same condition as Victim- I observed the room more than 18 years ago. 
d. Inside a safe in a closet on the third floor, the Search team discovered and seized, 
among other items, several binders containing sleeves of compact discs, most of which are labeled 
with handwriting. In total, the binders contain dozens of compact discs. Some discs contain the 
word "Zorro" or "LSJ." Based on my conversations with law enforcement agents who have 
participated in this investigation, I believe the name "Zorro" refers to Zorro Ranch, EPSTEIN's 
property in New Mexico, and the name LSJ refers to Little Saint James, i.e., the Subject Premises. 
The majority of the discs contain titles that include female names. Some of the discs in the binders 
seized by the Search Team have titles that appear to refer to trips or vacations. 
e. In the drawer of a dresser in a room on the Fifth floor of the New York Residence, 
the Search team discovered and seized, among other items, a shoebox (the "Shoebox") containing 
numerous compact discs. The majority of the discs are labeled, in handwriting, with female names. 
One disc is marked "Thai Massage." Another disc is marked "Blonde Girl Photo Shoot." Yet 
another disc is marked "Misc. Girls Nude/Dinner--Scientists." The discs in the Shoebox were 
seized by the Search Team. In another drawer of that same dresser, the Search Team discovered 
loose polaroid photographs depicting young, nude females who, based on the training and 
experience of law enforcement officers who observed them, appear to be teenagers. 
f. In a closet on the Fifth Floor of the Epstein Residence, the Search Team discovered, 
among other items, a box marked "women/old photos." The box contained, among other items, 
2017.08.02 
EFTA00020149
--- PAGE 10 ---
approximately seven compact discs, which are labeled with hand-written titles. One disc is marked 
"nudes 00-24." Another is labeled "Photographer--_`03" 
The remaining discs contain titles 
that include female names. All of the foregoing discs were seized by the Search Team. 
g. In that same closet, the Search Team discovered numerous black binders containing 
what appear to be print outs of digital photographs (with file names underneath) and compact discs. 
The binders appeared to contain, among other photographs, photographs of nude or partially nude 
young girls, some of which are in sexually suggestive poses. Based on the training and experience 
of law enforcement officers who observed them, some of the young girls appear to be teenagers, 
some of whom appear to be under the age of 18. 
16. 
Based on my conversations with law enforcement agents who have conducted an 
initial review (the "Reviewing Agents") of the compact discs seized at the New York Residence 
as described in paragraphs 15(b)-(e) above (the "Seized Discs"), I have learned that the discs 
contain approximately thousands of nude or partially nude photographs of girls or young women, 
many of which are in sexually suggestive poses. Based on my conversations with the Reviewing 
Agents, who have particular training and experience relating to child erotica and visual depictions 
of children in child exploitation cases, I have learned that the Reviewing Agents believe that many 
of the nude or partially nude images they have reviewed appear to depict girls under the age of 18. 
Certain of these images appear to have been taken at a tropical location, and/or were labeled "LSJ" 
either in the image file name, or on the compact disc that contained the image. Based on the 
foregoing, I believe that a portion of the foregoing photographs appear to have been taken at the 
Subject Premises. In addition, I have learned that some of the file names are marked 
which 
are the initials o 
. As set forth below, I have interviewed an individual who has 
2017.08.02 
EFTA00020150
--- PAGE 11 ---
reported that 
photographed her at the Subject Premises. Accordingly, I believe 
that a portion of these photos may have been taken by 
17. 
On or about November 28, 2018, the Miami Herald began publishing a series of 
articles relating to the defendant, his sexual misconduct with minors, and a previous investigation 
into his conduct in Florida from in or about 2005 through 2008. The article included information 
about-'s 
role in EPSTEIN's sexual abuse of minors. Based on my participation 
in this investigation, I have learned that bank records obtained by the Government appear to show 
that just days later, on or about December 3, 2018, the defendant wired $250,000 from a trust 
account to 
This course of action, and in particular its timing, suggests that EPSTEIN 
was attempting to influence 
who might provide information against him in light of the 
recently re-emerging allegations. 
B. Probable Cause Regarding the Subject Premises 
18. 
Based on my review of property records, I believe that JEFFREY EPSTEIN has 
been the owner of the Subject Premises since at least the time of the Subject Offenses. In 
particular, it appears that an entity named "L.S.J., LLC" held title to the Subject Premises from in 
or about 1998. In or about 2011, L.S.J., LLC transferred title to the Subject Premises to an entity 
named "Nautilus, Inc.," for $10. On the transfer paperwork, EPSTEIN signed as the "sole 
member" of L.S.J., LLC and as the "president and sole beneficial owner" of Nautilus, Inc. 
19. 
In addition, I believe that up until recently, the Subject Premises was JEFFREY 
EPSTEIN's principal residence. In particular, I have reviewed sex offender registration data, and 
have learned that, on or about June 17, 2019, EPSTEIN listed the Subject Premises as his primary 
residence. At the time of EPSTEIN's arrest on or about July 6, 2019, I and other law enforcement 
officers conducted an inventory search of EPSTEIN's personal effects, and observed that 
II 
2017.08.02 
EFTA00020151
--- PAGE 12 ---
EPSTEIN was carrying a driver's license that listed the Subject Premises as EPSTEIN's home 
address. 
20. 
As discussed herein, I believe that evidence of the Subject Offenses will be found at 
the Subject Premises. In particular, based on my conversations with law enforcement agents who 
have conducted an initial review of the Seized Discs, I have learned the following: 
a. Many of the photographs appear to be labeled with file names that include "LSJ," 
which I believe stands for Little St. James. 
b. As discussed above, photographs seized from the New York Residence appear to 
depict nude or partially nude young girls, and a portion of those photos appear to have been taken 
at the Subject Premises, based on the fact that (i) some of the photos appear to have been taken in 
a tropical location, and (ii) some of the file names of the photographs and/or the labels on the discs 
containing the files of nude or partially nude young girls in a tropical location are marked "LSJ," 
i.e., the Subject Premises. 
c. Among the photographs seized from the New York Residence, the Reviewing 
Agents identified partially-nude photographs of a young girl, labeled with the name of a particular 
individual ("Individual-1"). The photographs appear to depict Individual-1 on a beach in what 
appears to be a tropical location. 
21. 
In or about July 2019, I participated in an interview of Individual-1, with her 
counsel present. Based on my personal observations, I believe that the photographs described in 
Paragraph 17(c) depict Individual-1. During the course of the interview, Individual-1 stated that 
she met EPSTEIN in 2003 when she was approximately 17, and that she travelled to EPSTEIN's 
properties in New Mexico, Florida, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, i.e., the Subject Premises, before 
2017.08.02 
EFTA00020152
--- PAGE 13 ---
she turned 18. EPSTEIN paid for the trips, and would give Individual-1 money and gifts while 
she traveled with him. 
22. 
During these trips, EPSTEIN sexually abused and assaulted her on approximately 
four different occasions, all of which occurred before she turned 18. Individual-1 reported that 
EPSTEIN raped her during two of these incidents. Indivdual-1 recalled that one or more of these 
instances of sexual abuse occurred on the Subject Premises. Individual-1 further reported that, 
when she was approximately 17, 
photograph Individual-1 at the Subject Premises. 
23. 
In or about August 2019, I and another law enforcement officer interviewed an 
individual ("Individual-23') who regularly performed work for JEFFREY EPSTEIN as a contractor 
at the Subject Premises from approximately 1999 to 2005 or 2006. Individual-2 reported that, on 
several occasions, Individual-2 observed photographs of what appeared to be nude or partially 
nude young girls in several locations throughout the main residence of the Subject 
Premises. Individual-2 recalled a photograph depicting 
and two of girls, all of 
three whom were topless; Individual-2 estimated that the two girls in the photograph appeared to 
be approximately 15 or 16 years old. Individual-2 knew 
to be EPSTEIN's assistant at 
that time. 
24. 
Based on my review of flight logs from a private jet owned by JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
I have learned that 
traveled to the U.S. Virgin Islands at least approximately 
once a month between October 2001 and November of 2005. These records do not include any 
travel 
may have taken on commercial airlines. 
25. 
For all of these reasons, I am aware that 
has spent significant 
time at the Subject Premises and that evidence of her involvement, and potentially the involvement 
asked to photograph her, and did in fact 
2017.08.02 
EFTA00020153
--- PAGE 14 ---
of other co-conspirators, may be located at the Subject Premises. In particular, flight logs from 
EPSTEIN's private jet reflect that the individual identified in the Indictment as "Employee-3" 
traveled to the U.S. Virgin Islands on approximately nine separate occasions. These records do not 
include any travel Employee-3 may have taken on commercial airlines. As set forth in the 
Indictment, Employee-3 scheduled victims' encounters with EPSTEIN. 
26. 
Based on my training, experience, and participation in this investigation, I believe 
that there is probable cause that evidence of the Subject Offenses, such as photographs of 
EPSTEIN's victims and co-conspirators, will be found at the Subject Premises. In particular, 
information provided by Individual-1, with whom EPSTEIN engaged in sex acts at the Subject 
Premises while Individual-1 was a minor, confirms that EPSTEIN engaged in conduct relevant to 
the Subject Offenses at the Subject Premises. In addition, photographs on the Seized Discs 
recovered during the search of the New York Residence depict other young and partially nude girls 
photographed at the Subject Premises, which suggests that EPSTEIN brought those girls to the 
Subject Premises and that, consistent with the accounts provided by Individual-1, Victim-1 and 
other victims identified in the Indictment, EPSTEIN likely sexually abused them at the Subject 
Premises as well. Evidence of co-conspirators' presence at the Subject Premises at times when 
victims were abused, including photographs, may also be found at the Subject Premises. Indeed, 
as noted above, Individual-2 has observed a photograph of 
partially-nude young girls at 
the Subject Premises. 
27. 
Moreover, while the sexual abuse described above occurred principally between 
approximately 2002 and 2005, as evidence recovered from the New York Residence including the 
Seized Discs makes clear, EPSTEIN continued to maintain substantial evidence of the Subject 
Offenses up until the time he was arrested in 2019. Indeed, as described above, in addition to the 
2017.08.02 
EFTA00020154
--- PAGE 15 ---
Seized Discs, Epstein continued to maintain a "massage room" complete with a massage table and 
various sex toys that remained similar in makeup and appearance to descriptions of the same room 
provided by Victim-1 based on Victim-1's encounters with EPSTEIN in 2004. 
28. 
In addition, I believe that evidence of the Subject Offenses, including but not 
limited to photographs/evidence created at the Subject Premises, may be located not only at the 
New York Residence but also at the Subject Premises because (i) the Subject Premises was the 
location of multiple photo shoots of young girls; (ii) the Subject Premises appears to have been, 
for the last several years and up until the time of his arrest, EPSTEIN's primary residence; and (iii) 
given its location, the Subject Premises is JEFFREY EPSTEIN's most private residence. 
Therefore, given that EPSTEIN has maintained evidence of the Subject Offenses, he is likely to 
have maintained some of that evidence in or on the Subject Premises. Moreover, given that there 
is probable cause to believe that JEFFREY EPSTEIN and others, including 
conspired to commit the Subject Offenses, evidence of EPSTEIN's involvement in trafficking 
minors would also be relevant to the investigation of, and any future charges against, other 
members of the conspiracy, such as 
29. 
According to international flight records that I have reviewed, a private jet owned 
and utilized by Epstein has traveled to or from the U.S. Virgin Islands at least on or about April 
14, 2019; May 5, 2019; May 18, 2019; and June I1, 2019. Accordingly, there is probable cause 
to believe that EPSTEIN recently has been present at the Subject Premises. 
30. 
Based on my training and experience in investigating individuals who engage in sex 
trafficking of minors, and who sexually exploit minors, such individuals often maintain 
photographs of their victims, and/or other erotic images of minors, at their residences. Individuals 
2017.08.02 
EFTA00020155
--- PAGE 16 ---
who engage in such offenses often hoard such images in the privacy of their residences. In 
particular, data related to their illegal activity is often stored on their computers. 
31. 
In my training and experience, individuals who store nude and/or sexually 
suggestive photographs of minors on compact discs or other external storage devices typically 
access those images from computers and other electronic devices in order to view those images, 
and individuals who store such materials on compact discs typically store similar files on other 
computing devices and storage devices. 
32. 
Based on my training and experience, I also know that, where computers are used in 
furtherance of criminal activity, evidence of the criminal activity can often be found months or 
even years after it occurred. This is typically true because: 
• 
Electronic files can be stored on a hard drive for years at little or no cost and users thus 
have little incentive to delete data that may be useful to consult in the future. 
• 
Even when a user does choose to delete data, the data can often be recovered months or 
years later with the appropriate forensic tools. When a file is "deleted" on a home 
computer, the data contained in the file does not actually disappear, but instead remains 
on the hard drive, in "slack space," until it is overwritten by new data that cannot be 
stored elsewhere on the computer. Similarly, files that have been viewed on the Internet 
are generally downloaded into a temporary Internet directory or "cache," which is only 
overwritten as the "cache" fills up and is replaced with more recently viewed Internet 
pages. Thus, the ability to retrieve from a hard drive or other electronic storage media 
depends less on when the file was created or viewed than on a particular user's 
operating 
system, 
storage 
capacity, 
and 
computer 
habits. 
• 
In the event that a user changes computers, the user will typically transfer files from the 
old computer to the new computer, so as not to lose data. In addition, users often keep 
backups of their data on electronic storage media such as thumb drives, flash memory 
cards, CD-ROMs, or portable hard drives. 
C. Return of ESI 
33. 
If the Government determines that the electronic devices are no longer necessary to 
retrieve and preserve the data, and the devices themselves are not subject to seizure pursuant to 
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41(c), the Government will return these items, upon request. 
2017.08.02 
EFTA00020156
--- PAGE 17 ---
Computer data that is encrypted or unreadable will not be returned unless law enforcement 
personnel have determined that the data is not (i) an instrumentality of the offense, (ii) a fruit of 
the criminal activity, (iii) contraband, (iv) otherwise unlawfully possessed, or (v) evidence of the 
Subject Offenses. 
III. Conclusion and Ancillary Provisions 
34. 
Based on the foregoing, I respectfully submit there is probable cause to believe that 
evidence of the Subject Offenses, and in particular the items described in Attachment A, will be 
located within the Subject Premises and therefore request the court to issue a warrant to seize the 
items and information specified in Attachment A to this affidavit and to the Search and Seizure 
Warrant.

ATTACHMENT A 
I. Premises to be Searched—Subject Premises 
The Subject Premises are particularly described as a private island in the U.S. Virgin 
Islands, known as Little Saint James, any buildings or other structures contained thereon, and any 
closed containers/items contained therein. Little Saint James is an approximately 75 acre island 
located approximately four miles off the southeast coast of St. Thomas Island. The Subject 
Premises is depicted in the following photograph: 
The Subject Premises contains multiple structures, including but not limited to: 
a. 
On the northeast end of the Subject Premises, there is a single story structure next to 
a pool. 
b. 
On the southwest end of the Subject Premises, there is a single-story, four-wall 
structure. The walls are painted with blue and white stripes. The structure has large double doors 
as its main entrance and large windows on the three remaining walls. 
c. 
On the north east end of the Subject Premises, there are multiple structures. The 
main structure is a single story residence (the "Main Residence") with a stone exterior, a blue roof, 
and a white detailed exterior that includes white columns. 
d. 
A separate structure ("Residence One") with a blue roof and stone exterior is at the 
back of the Main Residence, located at the end of the northeast tip of the island and surrounded by 
coastline on two of its sides. 
2017.08.02 
EFTA00020162
--- PAGE 23 ---
e. 
A second larger structure ("Residence Two) is set between the Main Residence and 
the coastline. 
f. 
Four smaller single story structures (the "Four Cabanas") are next to the Main 
Residence and a large pool. All four smaller structures have blue roofs. 
g. 
A third large structure ("Residence Three") set off from the four smaller structures 
and next to the coast line is painted white and has a blue roof. Residence Three appears to have 
two levels throughout and also appears to be at a lower elevation than the Main Residence, 
Residence Two, and the Four Cabanas. 
h. 
Behind Residence Three and along the coastline is a small roofed structure at the 
end of a wooden dock (the "Dock House"). 
i. 
There are two single story sheds ("Shed One" and "Shed Two") that are located just 
southwest of the Main Residence. Shed One and Shed Two appear to have a metal-like exterior 
that is a green-blue color. 
j. 
Next to Shed One and Shed Two is a four wall structure that appears to have several 
sally port type doors ("Maintenance One"). A second structure ("Maintenance Two") is next to 
Maintenance One and has a white exterior with four sets of white double doors and three single 
white doors. 
k. 
Near the center of the island is a single story structure ("Residence Four") that has a 
stone exterior and blue roof. The front of Residence Four has three dark double doors. 
I. 
Next to the helicopter landing pad are two small structures with blue roofs 
("Helipad Buildings"). 
m. 
On the west side of the Subject Premises on the coast is an approximately two-level 
structure with a blue roof ("Residence Five"). 
II. Items to Be Seized 
A. Evidence, Fruits, and Instrumentalities of the Subject Offenses 
This warrant authorizes the seizure of certain evidence, fruits, and instrumentalities of 
violations of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1591 (sex trafficking of minors), and 371 (sex 
trafficking conspiracy) (the "Subject Offenses") described as follows: 
1. 
Any documents or communications with or regarding victims or potential victims 
of the Subject Offenses or between EPSTEIN and co-conspirators to the Subject Offenses; 
2. 
Any photographs of victims or potential victims of the Subject Offenses, or co-
conspirators to the Subject Offenses. 
2017.08.02 
EFTA00020163
--- PAGE 24 ---
3. 
Any nude, partially nude, or sexually suggestive photographs of individuals who 
appear to be teenage girls, or younger. 
4. 
Any documents evidencing the presence of co-conspirators at the Subject Premises.

OCME just completed the autopsy and the findings are consistent with strangulation/hanging. Epstein had a broken hiatal 
bone and injuries to the left shoulder that are consistent with hanging. Per OCME, there is no reason to suspect that 
Epstein did not hang himself. OCME will wait to finalize the report until after the toxicology reports come back, and 
OCME has had an opportunity to review any reports of interviews of the first guards on the scene who discovered Epstein. 
We will continue to keep you posted. Please let us know if you have any questions. Thanks.

SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

J78repsc 
(Case called) 
THE COURT: Good afternoon. 
I think I'm pretty much up to speed as to where you 
are in the sense that I am aware that you have been before 
Magistrate Judge Pitman earlier this morning and up to some few 
minutes ago for purposes of presentment, arraignment, and some 
preliminary discussion of bail. Is that accurate? 
MR. 
: That's correct, your Honor. I don't 
want to speak for defense counsel, but my understanding is they 
expect to put in some sort of written submission and return to 
argue the rest of the bail hearing on Thursday before Judge 
Pitman at 2:00. That is, if your Honor refers the bail hearing 
to Judge Pitman on that basis as well. 
THE COURT: I might just take that bail application 
before me. We'll figure out a time when that would be 
comfortable for all of you. How is that? 
MR. WEINGARTEN: That's fine with the government, your 
Honor. 
THE COURT: I have a few items on my list. I want to 
make mention, I'm sure Magistrate Judge Pitman did, of our 
presumption of innocence. Even though in some of these 
discussions, and probably more so when we get to bail, it may 
sound like we are talking about merits of the case, it's 
important that we underscore that the presumption of innocence 
pertains to Mr. Epstein, now and until such time, if it comes, 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00020186
--- PAGE 3 ---
J78repsc 
that there is a guilty determination by a jury or by the Court, 
that he is presumed to be innocent. 
I did have these questions. One has to do with 
persons who are categorized as victims. I want to get some 
assurance from the U.S. Attorney's office that they have been 
notified about this case and that you will keep them abreast of 
developments in this case. 
MR. 
: Yes, your Honor, we are acutely aware 
of our obligations to the victims in this case. We have 
notified them and we expect to continue to do so as the case 
moves forward. 
THE COURT: Second, for my background, I am aware that 
there are certain conditions that attach to Mr. Epstein's sex 
offender status resulting from his Florida state prosecution in 
or about 2008. One result is that under New York law --
correct me if I'm wrong about any of this -- he is considered 
to be at high risk of committing another sex crime with minors. 
Is that a fair characterization of his sex offender status? 
MR. 
: Your Honor, as the government set 
forth in its submission to Judge Pitman, and we copied this 
Court, it is our understanding that the defendant is a tier 3 
sex offender in New York and that that is characterized as 
high-risk individual. 
THE COURT: The question that I have is what are the 
implications, if any, of the search conducted by the U.S. 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00020187
--- PAGE 4 ---
J78repsc 
Attorney's office over the weekend of Mr. Epstein's residence 
on East 71st Street for the terms and conditions of his sex 
offender status, if any? Are there any consequences or 
relationship between what was uncovered and what he is obliged 
to do? 
MR. 
: May I have one moment, your Honor? 
THE COURT: Yes. 
MR. 
: Your Honor, in response to that 
question, at the outset I should say that we don't have 
particular interaction with state authorities with respect to 
those types of notifications. We are, I would say, in the 
early stages of reviewing those materials. With respect to the 
defendant's obligations or potential consequences in the New 
York State system, we certainly will notify whichever 
authorities are appropriate. I don't think that we have a role 
other than that. 
I will say that they are extremely concerning with 
respect to bail here, with respect to the conduct here, and
expect we will get into that more in our submissions and bail 
argument. 
THE COURT: By the way, if defense counsel wants to 
jump in at any point, feel free to do that? 
MR. WEINGARTEN: On that, we have not seen the 
pictures. 
THE COURT: I haven't either.

MR. WEINGARTEN: I understand. It is our expectation 
that they are ancient, that they are pre his spending time in 
prison, and/or they are erotic pictures of adults who 
voluntarily engaged in that conduct. 
THE COURT: I have a question about the Southern 
District of Florida nonprosecution agreement dated probably in 
2008 -- is that correct? 
MR. 
: It's dated in 2007, your Honor. 
THE COURT: Is that a public document? 
MR. WEINGARTEN: It is, your Honor. It's been 
publicly filed in connection with other civil litigation. 
THE COURT: Does that agreement bear on in any way the 
search and results of the search that were conducted at Mr. 
Epstein's townhouse over the weekend? 
MR. 
: Not in ways that I am aware of now, 
your Honor. Again, we are very much in progress on the search. 
We will continue to consider any other implications beyond this 
case as we continue to review those materials. 
On a separate note, your Honor, I want to add the 
government noted it is aware of its victim obligations. In 
terms of notification, we have made notification to individuals 
that we are in particular aware of. We also have listed a 
phone number for victims to be in touch with the FBI, with the 
U.S. Attorney's office. We have also put a website up and have 
asked victims to be in touch with us through those sources as 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00020189

J78repsc 
well. That is just to round out the notification that the U.S. 
Attorney's office has made. 
MR. WEINGARTEN: May I be heard briefly on that? 
THE COURT: Sure. 
MR. WEINGARTEN: For us, your Honor, the NPA is the 
center of the universe for everything, search included, because 
the NPA was the result of an extensive 3-year investigation by 
law enforcement in Florida. In essence, the Feds made Mr. 
Epstein plead to a state offense and they declined prosecution 
federally, and that is translated in the NPA. Mr. Epstein did 
his time, Mr. Epstein is on the registration list, and Mr. 
Epstein paid the alleged victims. 
As I am sure you have noted from the indictment, that 
conduct too is an ancient history. That conduct is 2002 to 
2005. It is our belief that this is basically a re-do. This 
is basically the Feds today, not happy with what happened in 
the decision that led to the NPA, redoing the same conduct that 
was investigated 10 years ago and calling it, instead of 
prostitution, calling it sex trafficking. We think that is the 
heart of everything, and that will be the centerpiece of our 
defense, at least legally. 
THE COURT: My understanding of what the government is 
asserting is that the episodes that occurred in Manhattan were 
not included in the nonprosecution agreement in Florida and 
that there is a separate basis not only for a sex trafficking 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00020190

J78repsc 
count but also for a sex trafficking conspiracy count. 
MR. WEINGARTEN: We have had good conversations with 
the prosecutors, and we like and respect them. We are looking 
forward to getting discovery. We are interested to see whether 
the prosecutors in Florida, who are now under severe criticism 
years later, steered the alleged victims to New York, 
whether or not they violated their responsibilities under the 
NPA. 
THE COURT: Whether the federal prosecutors in Florida 
violated their terms and conditions? 
MR. WEINGARTEN: That will certainly be germane. 
THE COURT: Is that the point? 
MR. WEINGARTEN: Yes. 
THE COURT: Got it. 
MR. 
: Your Honor, if I could very briefly 
respond to those points? 
THE COURT: Sure. 
MR. 
: I expect this will be briefed and 
argued on Thursday. I don't intend to go into extensive 
details about that. I just want to flag for the Court that 
defense counsel is saying that this conduct is ancient. What 
he is not saying is it is beyond the statute of limitations, 
because it is not. 
Second, the allegation that this is some kind of a 
conspiracy within the Department of Justice is just false. 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00020191
--- PAGE 8 ---
J78repsc 
There is no evidence to support that. The investigation was 
begun and conducted entirely separate from any other district. 
It began in the Southern District of New York. 
Certainly there is evidence that was gathered that is 
consistent with and even overlapping with the prior 
investigation. But as the Court noted, in particular an entire 
count of this indictment is with respect to New York victims. 
And that is before we even get to the fact that the 
nonprosecution agreement does not bind the Southern District of 
New York. 
THE COURT: I was going to ask you about that too. 
Now that you have mentioned the topic, explain that, would you. 
MR. 
: Yes, your Honor. I do expect that we 
can brief this, but the short version is that this prosecution 
is not precluded by the nonprosecution agreement entered into 
by the defendant in the Southern District of Florida. That 
agreement expressly referred to that federal district. It 
didn't purport to bind any other office or district. 
It is well-settled in the Second Circuit that a plea 
agreement in one U.S. Attorney's office does not bind another 
unless otherwise stated. That is even if, based on case law, 
the agreement refers generally to "the government." Again, 
additionally, as set forth in the indictment returned by the 
grand jury, the substantive count alleges acts occurring in New 
York and alleges New York-based victims. 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00020192
--- PAGE 9 ---
J78repsc 
That is in spite of the fact that the Southern 
District is not bound, is not a signatory to, and otherwise has 
no connection to the NPA. And there is no evidence that we 
have come across that the Southern District of New York was 
consulted, asked, involved, notified as far as we have seen. 
For those reasons and others I'm sure we will brief, 
we don't think the NPA applies to us. 
MR. WEINBERG: If I may reply briefly, your Honor? 
THE COURT: Yes. 
MR. WEINBERG: I have been one of Mr. Epstein's 
counsel through the CVRA litigation which started in 2008 and 
continues. In fact, our briefing is today. The NPA provided 
him with immunity for any offenses arising from a joint 
FBI/grand jury/U.S. Attorney investigation that led to a 
decision by Mr. Epstein to plead to a higher state offense than 
the state prosecutors contemplated. He went to jail, signed an 
agreement, and has lived up to its terms 100 percent. 
We have seen in the paperwork of the CVRA, in the 
Southern District of Florida, in writing at docket 205-2 the 
government's motion to dismiss CVRA, urging that the witnesses 
there go to the Southern District of New York and essentially 
try to motivate them to prosecute for the very same conduct, in 
other words, the conduct that Mr. Epstein was immunized, 
including travel between two states, telephonic communications 
between two states. Florida immunized him for the same travel 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00020193
--- PAGE 10 ---
J78repsc 
and telephonic communications as well as the 1591 category. 
In addition, the Department of Justice reviewed the 
NPA on several occasions in 2008 and essentially confirmed that 
the exercise of discretion shown in Florida was appropriate. 
But the most important thing is that there was communication 
between the prosecutors in Florida, perhaps through prosecutors 
in Georgia that took over the case because the Florida 
prosecutors were recused as a result of Judge Marrah's 
decisions in the CVRA case. 
We know the government is relying in part on evidence 
that was generated by the Southern District of Florida case 
back in 2007. They have talked about message pads, telephone 
records. They are the same message pads and telephone records 
that reflect conduct that was exclusively 15, 16, 17 years ago. 
So we do have a principal position that we will put to the 
Court at the appropriate time regarding the legality of this 
prosecution and whether or not it is appropriately barred. 
I can say as a criminal defense lawyer of 45 years, 
when there is an interstate wire, mailing, travel, and there is 
one district that is conducting an investigation, you negotiate 
with that district and count on the Department of Justice to 
what it does every day decade after decade after decade, which 
is not to go to the second jurisdiction that received the mail 
2.1 
that was sent from the immunizing jurisdiction and have a 
prosecution on the very same conduct. We will be briefing 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

Li 
that. 
THE COURT: Do you anticipate that there is going to 
be any discussion here about the legality of the NPA? 
MR. WEINBERG: Not the legality of the NPA. I think 
the discussion here is going to be about its scope. 
THE COURT: From the defense, yes. You don't think 
you expect to hear anything from the government, for example? 
MR. WEINBERG: In the Southern District case, the CVRA 
case, maybe two weeks ago the Northern District of Georgia 
prosecutors, who are proxy for the Southern District of 
Florida, filed the submission before District Judge Marrah in 
the CVRA case totally supporting the constitutionality and 
legality of the NPA, their discretion to enter into it, and 
that there absolutely has never been a charge that Mr. Epstein 
ever did anything other than fully perform his end as a citizen 
who is expecting the benefits of a contract that he lived up 
to. 
THE COURT: I thought there had been some contention 
that the way that the victims vis-a-vis the Florida NPA were 
dealt with or not dealt with was one basis for attacking the 
legality of that arrangement. 
MR. WEINBERG: The petitioners are vigorously and have 
vigorously for many years challenged, many years starting quite 
frankly after Mr. Epstein performed his obligations to go to 
jail and challenged it, claiming that there was no consultation 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00020195
--- PAGE 12 ---
J78repsc 
prior to the government's entering the agreement. 
The Department of Justice at the time did not believe 
the CVRA extended absent a federal charge. The predicate is a 
federal crime that harms a victim. The petitioners have 
vigorously asserted a different position. Judge Marrah, in a 
summary judgment motion, agreed with the petitioners as to the 
fault of the government in not conferring. The issue of remedy 
is before Judge Marrah at the present time, your Honor. 
THE COURT: Okay. 
MR. 
: Your Honor, if I may very briefly? 
THE COURT: Yes. 
MR. 
: The crux of the defense argument here 
I think cuts precisely the other way. They are arguing that 
the Southern District of Florida has sort of sent up a flag 
that these prosecutions could be undertaken elsewhere. That's 
true. The Southern District of Florida has argued in papers 
that they believed, the Southern District of Florida believed, 
that the nonprosecution agreement was limited to that district. 
They have said that out loud and in public and in their 
positions in filing. 
So certainly this investigation was not shoveled to 
the Southern District of New York from anywhere else, including 
the Department of Justice. We expect that the nonprosecution 
agreement will not be an impediment, in particular because the 
defendant certainly did not lack for sophisticated counsel in 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00020196
--- PAGE 13 ---
J78repsc 
negotiating that agreement, which again did not include the 
Southern District of New York. We don't expect that to be any 
impediment at all here. 
THE COURT: Got it. 
This is a small item. In the pretrial services report 
which was prepared today -- how many, if more than one, 
passports does Mr. Epstein have? 
MR. WEINGARTEN: Mr. Epstein reported today one. Two 
others were rescinded. As we understand it, there is one 
effective passport today. 
I would like to make one other point about the 
pretrial that is extremely important. 
THE COURT: Go ahead. 
MR. WEINGARTEN: The way it reads is that we have 
refused to provide information about income and assets. 
THE COURT: I didn't really read it that way myself. 
I thought it was incomplete in some places and I thought it 
could be beefed up, so to speak. But I imagine that in the 
bail application those matters may be dealt with. 
MR. WEINGARTEN: Exactly. 
THE COURT: For Mr. 
: In your letter you 
describe some obstruction or harassment, witness tampering, 
alleged, by Mr. Epstein. That, I take it, is going to be 
included in any response or any bail submission made by the 
government? 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00020197
--- PAGE 14 ---
J78repsc 
MR. 
: Your Honor, I think we addressed that 
in our initial submission. To the extent defense counsel has a 
response to it, we will evaluate that response and see whether 
additional submission from the government is required or 
appropriate. 
THE COURT: I think that's it for me in terms of 
questions that I might have had. 
There is, of course, a conspiracy charge here, one of 
the two counts. It may be early in your investigation to know. 
Do you anticipate that there may be other defendants in this 
proceeding? 
MR. 
: Your Honor, we don't expect any 
imminent superseding indictments in this case. It certainly is 
possible down the road. 
MR. WEINGARTEN: May I make one point, your Honor? 
These obstruction allegations we find very nettlesome and 
bothering. My understanding is that the Feds and Mr. Epstein's 
attorneys back in the early 2000s, or 2007 and 8, when they 
were negotiating were looking desperately for an appropriate 
statute. They finally settled on a state statute that Mr. 
Epstein pled to. We all know how unusual that is. There was 
some consideration of a federal statute, including obstruction. 
So lawyers in good faith were having discussions back 
and forth whether or not they could squeeze Mr. Epstein's 
conduct into a particular statute, and they concluded they 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00020198
--- PAGE 15 ---
J78repsc 
couldn't because the facts didn't fit. That is my 
understanding of how those obstruction discussions arose. 
THE COURT: Got it. 
In terms of bail application, it would be helpful, and 
maybe this is your anticipation, to file written submissions. 
If you could do that. What I'm getting to is Thursday 
afternoon is not a good time, in my opinion. I would prefer to 
do it, if you would go along with this, Monday morning at, say, 
9:30. That would give everybody more time to make these 
submissions and to study them. Is that agreeable? 
MR. WEINGARTEN: Yes. 
MR. WEINBERG: Yes. 
THE COURT: Why don't we say Monday at 10:00. Have 
you arranged written submissions on any time schedule with 
Magistrate Judge Pitman? 
MR. 
: May we have just a moment, your 
Honor, with defense counsel? 
THE COURT: Yes, would you. And also determine if one 
party or the other is going first and that the other is 
responding or they are simultaneous. 
MR. 
(Pause) 
MR. 
Yes, your Honor. Thank you. 
Your Honor, the government is 
prepared to rely on its initial submission at least for its 
first argument. I expect defense counsel will respond to that 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00020199
--- PAGE 16 ---
J78repsc 
and propose a package. Then the government would like an 
opportunity to reply to that submission. 
The parties would be happy to make those deadlines 
Thursday and Saturday respectively. However, we are also happy 
to back that up a little bit if the Court prefers not to 
receive the government's submission over the weekend. We could 
do an earlier deadline on Thursday for defense and a late 
Friday deadline for the Court from the government, depending on 
what the Court prefers. 
THE COURT: I was going to propose defense Thursday at 
noon. Is that okay to get your submission in? 
MR. WEINBERG: We can do that, your Honor. 
THE COURT: Thanks. 
And if you could respond Friday by 5:00 p.m. 
MR. 
: We will, your Honor. Thank you. 
THE COURT: Then we can have oral presentations. I 
take it everybody wants to have oral presentations in addition 
to the written. I'll set aside as much time as we need on the 
15th at 10:00. 
I ask the government if there is a speedy trial issue 
or application that takes us to Monday at 10:00 a.m. 
MR. 
: Yes, your Honor. The government asks 
that speedy trial time be excluded until Monday. We do expect 
to begin the process of working on producing discovery, to 
include discussions with defense counsel about a protective 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
EFTA00020200
--- PAGE 17 ---
J78repsc 
order. I think, frankly, the outcome of that will be effected 
by the coming week. But we do expect to have those 
conversations and therefore request that speedy trial time be 
excluded until Monday. 
THE COURT: I am going to find under 18 United States 
Code 3161 that the request for adjournment, joined in by both 
sides, to and including Monday the 15th at 10:00 a.m., is 
appropriate and warrants exclusion of the adjourned time from 
speedy trial calculations. 
I further find that the exclusion is designed to 
prevent any possible miscarriage of justice to facilitate these 
proceedings and, initially at least, so that counsel has time 
to prepare written bail submission and to guarantee effective 
representation of and preparation by counsel for both sides. 
Thus, the need for exclusion and the ends of justice outweigh 
the interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial 
pursuant to 18 U.S.C. section 3161(h) (7)(A) and (B). 
Does anybody want to add anything to today's session? 
MR. 
: Your Honor. May we have one more 
moment with defense counsel? 
THE COURT: Sure. 
(Pause) 
MR. 
: Nothing from the government. Your 
Honor. 
THE COURT: Defense? 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.

MR. WEINBERG: Nothing from the defense, your Honor.

THE COURT: So, today's conference was scheduled at 
the end of the July 18 court conference hearing on that date. 
I thought that we would devote at least the -- well, probably 
most of today's proceeding to talking about the schedule in 
this case, and I asked the lawyers to get together and see if 
they could come up with a mutually agreeable schedule, which 
would include trial date, motion practice, discovery, etc. 
Does anybody want to let me know how you made out? 
MS. §§§: Yes, your Honor. 
We have conferred with defense counsel and talked 
about a proposed schedule for this case. So we are prepared to 
propose to the court today a schedule for discovery, for 
discovery-related motions, for pretrial motions, and we are 
also prepared to talk about setting a possible trial date. 
THE COURT: Okay. What have you got in mind? 
MS. III: So, with respect to discovery, we would 
propose a discovery deadline of October 31 to complete 
discovery, with one exception. There are materials from 
devices seized from the defendant's residence in New York, and 
the F.B.I. is beginning the process of reviewing that data. 
In discussing that with defense counsel, we have begun 
to discuss a process for a privilege-review protocol. It's 
possible that process may take longer than October 31. But 
aside from that universe of documents, we would propose setting 
a schedule of October 31 as a deadline for discovery. 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
(212) 805-0300 
EFTA00020204

j7v2espC kjc 
For discovery-related motions, we would propose that 
the defense file any motions that they are aware of relating to 
discovery, to include motions relating to the nonprosecution 
agreement, by September 13 --
THE COURT: By when? 
MS. 
September 13, your Honor. 
-- that the government be permitted to respond by 
October 4; with any reply due on October 11, as necessary. 
Of course we understand that if the defense comes to 
have additional motions related to discovery based on the 
ongoing discovery process that we will confer and propose an 
additional briefing schedule beyond that, as necessary. But 
with respect to motions that the defense is already aware of, 
including the NPA, that is the schedule that we would propose 
at this time. 
Regarding pretrial motions, your Honor, we would 
propose that the defense file their motions by January 10, that 
the government be permitted to respond by February 10, and that 
any replies be due on or before February 24. 
THE COURT: Got it. 
MS. ill: And finally, your Honor, we are prepared to 
discuss a trial date in this case. The government is asking 
the court to set a trial date in this matter. We would propose 
that the court schedule this matter for trial in June of next 
year, and we estimate that the trial would take approximately 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
(212) 805-0300 
EFTA00020205
--- PAGE 4 ---
j7v2espC kjc 
four to six weeks, and so that trial date would carry into 
July. And I understand that the defense has some comments 
about that proposal, but that's the government's proposal with 
respect to a trial date. 
THE COURT: Okay. Let me hear from the defense. 
Do I understand it correctly that, with the exception 
of the trial date, those dates are agreeable? 
MR. WEINBERG: Those dates are agreeable, your Honor. 
THE COURT: Counsel, whatever you wish to add, that 
would be fine. 
MR. WEINBERG: We would ask the court to set a 
preliminary trial date immediately after Labor Day. I say 
preliminary because we want time to assess Mr. Epstein's 
THE COURT: This year? 
MR. WEINBERG: Yes. 
THE COURT: This Labor Day. Okay. 
MR. WEINBERG: We want time to assess Mr. Epstein's 
ability to . .

MR. WEINBERG: I'm sorry. I am being told that your 
Honor was inquiring as to the year. Let me --
THE COURT: Yes. I thought you wanted a speedy trial, 
and so --
MR. WEINBERG: Not with a four- to six-week trial with 
discovery coming in October, Judge. I apologize for being 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
(212) 805-0300 
EFTA00020206
--- PAGE 5 ---
j7v2espC kjc 
imprecise. Labor Day 2020 or immediately thereafter. And I 
make that recommendation -- we haven't received the discovery 
yet. Understandably, it is coming, and I'm not in any way 
contesting that there has been a delay, but we haven't had an 
opportunity to start reviewing what the government has 
predicted to be over a million pages of discovery with 
Mr. Epstein and to assess Mr. Epstein's ability to exercise his 
constitutional right, while at MCC, in assisting counsel 
prepare for a very difficult case that addresses events that it 
is alleged occurred 14 to 17 years ago. 
THE COURT: Okay. 
MR. WEINBERG: So, we need time to receive a million 
pages of discovery and to prepare to defend a four- to six-week 
trial, when a lot of the immediate attention is going to be on 
the very unique and complex constitutional issues connected to 
the nonprosecution agreement, our contention that the 
government's allegations are inextricably intertwined and 
constitutionally barred by the NPA. There are double jeopardy 
issues both connected to the conspiracy count, which looks to 
be an overlap with one of the charges that was expressly within 
the immunity provisions in the NPA. We are going to be 
spending a lot of time, and that's why I agreed with the 
government that we should make early discovery motions on the 
NPA-related issues, on double-jeopardy-related issues, so that 
we could not only facially brief the motion to dismiss, but 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
(212) 805-0300 
EFTA00020207
--- PAGE 6 ---
j7v2espC kjc 
have the discovery, the subfacial discovery, if you will, so 
that we could make a comprehensive briefing along the lines of 
the schedule for motions. 
THE COURT: That's what I was going to suggest, if 
there is a time period when you could put it all together, as 
it were, and there is a lot of flexibility. So I will leave 
these dates, you know, for now. 
With respect to the trial date, I could accommodate 
either June or September of 2020. The issue is not so much as, 
from my point of view, when you are all ready, but what part of 
the calendar I block out. So is it realistic to block out time 
in June? 
MR. WEINBERG: I think it is -- I don't want to have 
the court block out a six-week time and then come to the court 
in March and say we need a continuance and risk a September 
date. 
THE COURT: Got it. Okay. So a September date, you 
are saying, sounds like it certainly is realistic. 
MR. WEINBERG: Thirteen months sounds like the amount 
of time that we would ordinarily need to prepare a case of this 
magnitude and scope. 
THE COURT: All right. That is fine for me. 
Just while we are taking care of details, a speedy 
trial issue or application? Why don't we extend it to 
September of 2020? 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C. 
(212) 805-0300 
EFTA00020208
--- PAGE 7 ---
j7v2espC kjc 
MR. WEINBERG: This case certainly meets all of the 
statutory criteria for complexity and we would agree to that 
extension, Judge. 
MS. §§§: Your Honor, may I briefly be heard with 
respect to the trial date? 
THE COURT: Oh, sure. You know, it does sound like it 
is kind of premature, but I'm happy to hear you. It is often 
the defense that is ahead of the government, or not often, but 
equally, but here it is the other way around. So if the 
defense is not ready, it would be my practice to defer to the 
defense, but I don't know that it is fixed in stone either way. 
But, sure, I am happy to hear you. 
MS. ill: Your Honor, by way of background, we had 
initially proposed to the defense a May trial date. We think 
that there is a public interest in bringing this case to trial 
as swiftly as manageable. We understand, given their concerns 
in wanting to have more time, we proposed a date in June as a 
compromise position. We understand if the defense has 
indicated that they need additional time. We are sensitive to 
those concerns. But we do have a concern about the notion of 
setting a September trial date and that that trial would be 
preliminary or as a placeholder. Thirteen months is a 
considerable amount of time for a case of this nature to go to 
trial; and, again, given the time period of the charged conduct 
and the length of time that's passed, we do think that there is

a public interest in scheduling a fixed trial date in this 
case. Of course we understand if issues arise in the interim, 
we will address that as it occurs, but we do think it makes 
sense at this juncture to set a firm trial date. We don't 
think that any delay in this case is in the public interest. 
THE COURT: Counsel. 
MR. WEINBERG: We think that the delay in bringing 
this charge, your Honor, the natural corollary of that is to 
make it more difficult, not easier, for us to defend 
Mr. Epstein. For instance, there are certain sealed files for 
potential witnesses that we would have to go to other courts to 
seek to unseal. There is an NPA to litigate. This case is not 
your ordinary 1591 case. A case of four to six weeks is not 
the ordinary amount of time the government takes to prosecute, 
whether it is old or new cases. We need 13 months. I'm trying 
to make a principled argument, Judge, that that would be a 
schedule that we would try our best to meet, conditioned on our 
ability to work with Mr. Epstein under the current conditions. 
Thank you, sir. 
THE COURT: Okay. 
So, we are going to monitor the case from now until 
then anyway, so I think everybody will be in a better position 
to know what is realistic with respect to a trial date. I will 
exclude time from today through, let's say, June 8, but that, 
of course, is without prejudice to hearing from the defense and

the government as to actually where things stand. Long before 
then we will know. So we will have a conference, or several, 
between now and then. Let's see where everybody is as the 
months go by, and then we will know when we can effectively 
hold the trial. 
So I am going to find, under 18 United States Code 
3161, that the request for adjournment, joined in by both 
sides, is appropriate and warrants exclusion of the adjourned 
time from Speedy Trial calculations. I further find that the 
exclusion is designed to prevent any possible miscarriage of 
justice, to facilitate these proceedings, including extensive 
pretrial preparation, and to guarantee effective representation 
of and preparation by counsel for both sides, and thus the need 
for exclusion and the ends of justice outweigh the interests of 
the public and the defendant in a speedy trial pursuant to 18 
United States Code E. 3161(h)(7)(A) and (B). So that exclusion 
goes to June 8, 2020 preliminarily. 
Counsel, is it your thought that these motions would 
be on submission or did you want to have oral argument with 
respect to any aspect of them? 
MR. WEINBERG: We would seek oral argument, your 
Honor. 
THE COURT: So let's set October 28, 2019 for oral 
argument, and I am tentatively reserving some time on my 
calendar, as I said before, on June 8, 2020, but I will have

much better feel for where things are long before that and 
certainly I would say on October 28 we would have a much 
clearer picture of how things stand. 
So there you have it. Did you have -- go ahead. 
MS. §§§: Just to clarify, your Honor, what time would 
the court like the parties to appear on October 28? 
THE COURT: 10 a.m. 
MS. §§§: Thank you, your Honor. 
THE COURT: And the June 8 date is 9 a.m. Okay? 
MR. WEINBERG: Would your Honor want to schedule an 
argument on the substantive motions that will be fully briefed 
before the court on February 24? 
THE COURT: Yup. 
So let's schedule that oral argument for March 12, 
2020, at 10 a.m. 
Great. So anything anybody else has to talk about? 
MR. WEINBERG: Not from the defense, your Honor. 
MS. III: Not from the government, your Honor. Thank 
you. 
THE COURT: Okay. 
MR. WEINBERG: Thank you very much, sir.

I just had positive conversations with 
and 
(and =) -= 
had understood that FBI was getting their own 
hard drive to transfer the data, which obviously makes sense. 
response to 
email was to just have 
order a 12 TB drive, which she expects will get to 
next week. I also think that's a better option than the 2 TB 
drive that 
says we have available on short notice, given that we expect the data to be somewhere around 20-40 TB 
(the capacity of the devices we seized is around 40-50 TB). 
I take it from 
email that he's otherwise ready to give us the data, although that certainly would be a new 
development, but we're obviously hopeful that's the case. The key question then will be whether what we get from him 
this time is actually usable. If it's not, I think at that point it will make sense to just have BRG do it — they can physically 
take the devices themselves and do it. We had asked about that possibility from the beginning and CART was resistant, 
but given the past nine months I think we should do it if necessary. But, hopefully the intervention of higher-ups solves 
the problem and we can get the data in the next couple weeks, which would be great.

Wanted to circle back on this and check in, particularly because we desperately need to get the results from the July and 
September searches before moving forward with possible additional charges in the case. I know you had mentioned you 
needed to push back your prior estimate of complete production by early June, by a couple weeks, so wanted to see what 
the current estimate is? I don't think we've started to get anything yet but please correct me if I'm wrong.

Unfortunately, recent events and our staffing levels have conspired to put a kink in just about everything. If we 
can't make heads or tails of the stuff I've already produced, we'll do it again. They have told us that our staffing 
levels will be steadily increasing over the next few weeks, but I'm going to have to push back my estimate by a 
week or 2. Sorry about that. My next day in the office is Thursday, so I'll be able to see if I can easily identify 
what I already gave you and many it to a reliable identifier.

Thanks for this update — we'll take a look and circle back if any questions. 
Separately, to follow up on a question from the May 15 email below, the list has just five devices as still pending to be 
transferred to us, and I think it's right that the plan is to reproduce all the materials so that we can get them in searchable 
format, but just wanted to confirm? Currently, we aren't able to match any of the prior productions to specific devices —
so if we're able to match them up by Bates number now, that might work, but otherwise I think it makes sense for us to 
get everything. But let us know if any issue with that. 
And related to that question, are we still on track to get the full range of data in the next week or so? I don't think we've 
gotten any updates on that status in the past few weeks, and we're eager to be able to start reviewing.

Updated item descriptions. Just a side note, many thumb drives and SD cards will not have a serial number 
visible externally, but will report one through our tools. I included those electronically reported serial numbers.

Thanks for this, it's a helpful start. In terms of being able to write our search warrant, one additional piece of information 
we need is the serial number, or some other specific identifier, ideally for each device but at least for any device that there 
is more than one of the same thing. So for example, we need to be able to somehow differentiate the following devices — 
The two Dell power edge T310 hard drives (NYCO24323 and NYCO24324) 
The two Sony Vaio laptop / Fujitsu hdd (NYCO24336 and NYCO24337) 
the following loose storage devices: 
EFTA00020216
--- PAGE 5 ---
o Micro SD card (NYCO24339) 
o Flash Drive (generic) (NYCO24340) 
o Thumbdrive (Emtec) (NYCO24341) 
o hard drive (loose) (NYCO24342) 
o verbatim thumbdrive (NYCO24343) 
The four San Disk cruzer-thumbdrives (NYCO24344-47) 
The three Seagate IDE hard drives (NYCO24348-50) 
The camera SD card (NYCO24351) 
I think the rest of the devices are either specifically distinguishable and/or have an S/N listed. (By comparison, the USVI 
spreadsheet we have lists an s/n for about 20 of the 25(ish) devices. 
The other thing we're looking for is the location in the house (and ideally specific location) for each device, which the USVI 
list also has — is that info available? 
The list also has just five devices as still pending to be transferred to us, and I think it's right that the plan is to reproduce 
all the materials so that we can get them in searchable format, but just wanted to confirm? Currently, we aren't able to 
match any of the prior productions to specific devices — so if we're able to match them up by Bates number now, that

Here is The listing of all the evidence gathered in NY that I have. I added some columns to guide you to the 
unique numbers CART NY uses fro their evidence. The template wasn't a slam dunk over, so I did what I could to 
convey the information. If you are confused by anything, please let me know. In the column for approximate 
size, it is in GB, totaled at the bottom and converted to TB. In the materials contained column, I put what load 
file group the data was transferred over in (Mac, Windows, Loose Media, IDE, or Blacklight) If there is no entry 
in that column, that data has yet to be transferred. There are 2 Macs and a DVR you don't have as well as an 
iPhone and an iPad. IF the descriptions are a bit light, let me know and I'll do what I can to beef them up. I will 
get you the Island stuff tomorrow.

Respectfully, I think there are some miscommunications here — all we have asked is to receive the materials in a format 
such that we can view them using a system we have access to. We're not able to get web-enabled access through any FBI 
tool, so we asked for the materials to be transferred in a loadable format so we could put them on Relativity, which both 
we and the agents can access. We're required to have the files in a format that we can produce them to defense counsel. 
I've done that in many other cases and it hasn't previously been an issue. My understanding from 
is that the best 
way to do it now is just for us (the U.S. Attorney's Office) to get the original files, which our vendor will process—by which 
I just mean converting into file formats that are loadable onto Relativity. It doesn't really have anything to do with the 
taint review—we have to have access to the docs in our systems for discovery purposes. 
And we were happy to get the materials as they were processed, but when we received the 1.1 million documents earlier 
this year, they were in a format that wasn't usable for the reasons described in the email I sent on March 9. Again, I 
understand from 
that the best way forward is to just get copies of the materials in their original formats, which I 
understand will be segregated and designated by device. That should work for us! I was just trying to understand the 
approach, as well as the timeline.

Just to be clear. The US Attorney's Office (or it's contractors) are not "processing" anything. You are taking files 
that I will be extracting from processed evidence and putting them into an E-Discovery tool (Relativity) to do a 
taint review. 
Relativity is NOT a forensic tool. It is incapable of dealing with many things that are found forensically on a 
computer like free space, slack space, and system files to name a few. When we started this, and you insisted 
you do the taint review in Relativity, I warned you that it was adding months worth of work on top of what was 
already done, and that Relativity was incapable of viewing everything. You insisted we do it this way. So now 
and I have come up with a way to fit this round peg into this square hole. We will get it done. 
Sorry it has taken so long, but we are talking about terabytes worth of data over multiple forms of digital 
evidence. Phones, tablets, loose media, cameras, DVRs, servers, laptops, and desktop computers. We have 
gotten past encryption on multiple devices. When we review devices on such large cases, we usually do it piece 
by piece as things are processed, I was unaware that you didn't want to review as things were processed, that 
you wanted to do it "all at once", so that added to the delay. Sorry for that. Just a differentiation of 
methodology I suppose. 
and I feel confident that the method we have come up with will be more consistent and preserve the 
attribution of files to devices and links of e-mails to attachments that the load file generation that I did a while

Okay, so just to check, you both think that there is not a need to do a test run? You're both comfortable with just basically 
sending us copies of everything? I don't totally understand why we couldn't have done that eight months ago, but 
regardless of the passage of time, I want to make sure we understand so we can report to our supervisors. I assume that 
means that we (at the U.S. Attorney's Office and through contractors) will therefore need to do all the processing 
ourselves, correct? And thanks again to you both.

Unfortunately I don't think this is very helpful to us. Did you take a look at the example spreadsheet I sent on 2/24? The 
excel file you sent has descriptions that don't match up to the items listed in the search warrant returns (that we sent on 
2/23), and we don't have the 1B or CART numbers to be able to cross-reference. We also can't tell what you mean by 
"loose media" without a specific comparison to what was seized, we don't know which items you're referring to as 
"Windows machines," and we can't tell whether the entirety of any particular item has been transferred, or just partial. 
For example, it looks like we have gotten very, very few image files, which is surprising. 
We have also encountered some very significant problems in trying to review the more than 1 million documents we 
recently received: 
The data we've received has no way to put any emails and attachments together. So if an email says, "see the 
attached flight records," for example, we have no way of linking that up with the records themselves. Not only is 
that a big problem for us in review, it's going to be a huge problem for producing the documents to defense 
counsel. 
The load file has no link to the native file, so when we load the data to the database, there's no way to have the 
native files show up in the database. Because many of the files are too large to open in the viewer, it effectively 
means that there are many files that are completely invisible to us. 
Related, the control numbers in the load file don't match up to the native files. So we have two sets of numbers 
and no way to match up anything—that is, even if we were to try to go hunt down every individual large file in the 
native files, it would be impossible. 
So the data that we most recently got, we need to get in a form that addresses those issues, and we likely will need to get 
a similar reproduction of the data we received a couple months ago. Otherwise we're sifting through more than a million 
documents without much rhyme or reason.

I've re-attached the spreadsheet we sent last week — I think that's a good place to start in terms of our necessary record-
keeping, and we need that info at the very least, as well as anything else you think would be useful. Also attaching the SW

Here is a listing of what I have already handed over in load files to the US Attorney's Office for taint review. Some points of 
clarification: There were 9 IDE hard drives found in the Manhattan apartment, they turned out to be 3 copies of 3 drives 
(9 drives in total) from a July 2007 search on one of his properties. I only processed 3 (as they were all copies). All the 
loose media from the NY apartment is included. All the Windows machines from the NY apartment are included. Only 2 
Macs from NY and 1 from the Island are included. 
I will have to more closely coordinate with whoever is loading up Relativity with the remaining Macs as the tool 
they have to be processed with does not easily re-name the load files. 
Spreadsheet is attached.

Totally understand about the network issues—we can relate. I do still think it will be helpful to all sit down together to 
have an in-person discussion, to make sure everybody is on the same page. Are folks available for that next week? And 
what I think would be most helpful to facilitate that would be a spreadsheet of each separate device referenced in the two 
search warrant returns, with columns for whether we've dumped the contents, whether they've been reviewed and/or 
transferred, what portions were transferred, etc. 
Something roughly like the attached, with any other categories you think would be useful — and the info on the attached is 
mostly hypothetical, obviously, just as examples. That will help us fully understand what's been reviewed, transferred, 
and received so far, and what remains. 
(Also just on the pictures, we do want copies of those as well, please including from the discs and the devices — I think FBI

able to review them as well.)

Sony for the delayed response. They are tearing out our old network and giving us a new one, they mandated we 
delete old stuff (about 400 TB worth). Now that they are working on replacing the network, we can do only local 
work. I should be able to give you an accounting of what is what. I can say, off the top of my head, that all 
windows based items from the NY search have been handed over as well as all loose media. The CDs from NY 
only contained pictures, no documents. There are still some Apple items from NY that need to be produced. As 
far as the Island stuff goes, the 1st item on your spreadsheet, the "kitchen" mac has been produced. Still working 
on the rest.

Following up on the below from last weekend, I'm still not sure how we're addressing this so I thought it would make 
sense for us to all schedule a (hopefully relatively brief) meeting to all get on the same page? We didn't hear back on 
which files had previously been provided, but our tech folks did their best to differentiate, and we got access to the 
materials yesterday and its well over a million documents, and we don't have any idea what we're looking at — i.e., which 
devices the materials came from, whether it's full or partial results, how many more devices we have coming, etc. 
Based on the attached search warrant returns, it looks like from the New York mansion (the PDF) there are approximately 
devices that would have storage (computers, hard drives, thumb drives, etc.) and that's not even counting at least 60+ 
CDs. And then from the Virgin Islands (the Excel spreadsheet), at least more than 25 devices, including multiple servers / 
server racks. 
So we gotta know what we've already received, what remains, anticipated schedule, etc, and I know it's a lot of moving 
pieces on all sides so wanted to loop in everybody at once. The case team will be in California this coming week from 
Tuesday through Friday, but then I think generally around the first week of March, which will hopefully be plenty of time 
to schedule a productive meeting.

I'm not sure who's the exact right person to ask this, so wanted to get everybody on one email chain about it — I have the 
hard drive that 
dropped off that has new Epstein search warrant materials, but it looks like there are also old 
materials (that I think we had previously received and uploaded??) on the hard drive, and so I'm not sure what's new. 
Just generally, and 
and I talked about this last week too, but it's basically impossible for us to keep track of what 
we're getting, and what has been completed, without some kind of identification or labeling system, along with a list of 
which devices have been extracted and downloaded. 
EFTA00020226
--- PAGE 15 ---
So for example on the hard drive currently, there are 38 folders labeled "loadFiles" through "37loadFiles" with a modified 
date of 11/14/19, which I think we may have already previously received — but I'm not sure, because we haven't gotten 
any info on which folders match up to which devices, etc. And then there's another folder titled "NYC024362" that has a 
modified date of 1/27/20, so I think that may be the materials we hadn't previously received? That folder by itself has 
more than 600,000 items. 
I don't want to give 
anything that we've already previously received and uploaded, and I can't tell from the folder or 
file names whether everything on the drive is new, or whether just additional materials were saved onto it in addition to 
what we already have. =, 
are you able to give us some guidance on this? Ultimately what we really need is a 
spreadsheet of every device, whether it's been dumped (or partially dumped), and then identifying that same info —
which device, and what materials from it — are being given to us with each data transfer. Otherwise I think 
organizationally and for review purposes it will be a total disaster for us. 
We're happy to have a meeting on this if that's helpful — and thanks everybody for the assistance.

Dear 
The enclosed information is provided by the United States Department of Justice Victim Notification System 
(VNS). As a victim witness professional, my role is to assist you with information and services during the 
prosecution of this case. You have been designated to receive notifications on behalf of the following victim(s) 
(or potential victims) identified by law enforcement during the investigation of the case: 
Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell was arrested and charged as the result of a criminal investigation conducted by 
the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York. These charges arise out of an 
investigation into potential co-conspirators of Jeffrey Epstein. The main charge is categorized as Project Safe 
Childhood. Additional information reeardin. the case is set forth below. The lead prosecutors on the case are 
Victim's Rights 
Although the current charges against Maxwell may not contain allegations involving you personally, the 
Southern District of New York previously identified you as a victim or potential victim in a related case involving 
Jeffrey Epstein. 
Victims of all crimes under federal investigation are entitled to services under the Victims' Rights and 
Restitution Act (VRRA), including notification of court events. For further details, please refer to Title 34 United 
States Code section 20141 or the VRRA link posted at https://www.notify.usdoj.gov. 
Although you may not have been identified as a victim of the specific conduct charged in the Indictment 
against Maxwell, for your awareness, this letter provides details regarding the rights of crime victims in federal 
cases. Now that charges have been filed in federal court, victims of the charges filed are, in addition, entitled 
to the following rights, according to the Crime Victims' Rights Act, Title 18 United States Code section 3771: 
(1) The right to be reasonably protected from the accused; (2) The right to reasonable, accurate, and timely 
notice of any public court proceeding, or any parole proceeding, involving the crime or of any release or 
escape of the accused; (3) The right not to be excluded from any such public court proceeding, unless the 
court, after receiving clear and convincing evidence, determines that testimony by the victim would be 
materially altered if the victim heard other testimony at that proceeding; (4) The right to be reasonably heard at 
any public proceeding in the district court involving release, plea, sentencing, or any parole proceeding; (5) 
The reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the Government in the case; (6) The right to full and timely

restitution as provided in law; (7) The right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay; (8) The right to be 
treated with fairness and with respect for the victim's dignity and privacy; (9) The right to be informed in a 
timely manner of any plea bargain or deferred prosecution agreement; and (10) The right to be informed of the 
rights under this section and the services described in section 503(c) of the Victims' Rights and Restitution Act 
of 1990 (34 U.S.C. 20141(c)) and provided contact information for the Office of the Victims' Rights 
Ombudsman of the Department of Justice. If you want to inform the prosecutors of your views regarding any 
aspect of the case, please contact one of the prosecutors listed above or me at 
Please understand that these rights apply only to victims of the specific counts charged in federal court, and 
thus you may not be able to exercise all of these rights if the crime of which you are a victim is not within the 
scope of the Indictment. 
Because you have not been identified as a victim of the charges filed against Maxwell. we will not provide 
you with additional individualized notifications about this specific case unless you request such 
notifications. If you wish to receive ongoing notifications regarding this case, please contact me a 
Even if you do not receive individualized notifications regarding this case, we will make our best efforts to 
ensure you are provided the rights and services to which you are entitled. You may contact the Victim/Witness 
Coordinator at the office listed above if you have questions about the progress of your case, your rights or the 
services to which you are entitled, or how you can assert them during the proceedings. If you believe that a

New York, NY 10007 
Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (MN) 
Dear Judge Nathan: 
We write to respectfully request the Court to issue an order to the MDC directing it to 
accept two hard drives from defense counsel that contain the non-Highly Confidential discovery in 
this case for Ms. Maxwell's use at the MDC. 
In an effort to facilitate Ms. Maxwell's review of the discovery, defense counsel have 
created a master set of two hard drives that contain a complete set of the discovery produced by 
the government so far, excluding the materials marked Highly Confidential, which Ms. Maxwell is 
not permitted to possess in the MDC pursuant to the terms of the Protective Order. The master 
drives are easier to use than her existing hard drives because they collect all of the material in one 
place and organize the documents in a more user-friendly format. For example, the November 18, 
2020 production containing roughly 2.2 million pages was produced in load file format, which 
contains images of individual pages of documents in native file format, image file format, and 
other formats. The hard drives organize these files by document, as opposed to by page, and 
eliminate duplicative file formats so that Ms. Maxwell will not have to add countless hours to her 
review. 
Defense counsel would like to send these hard drives to Ms. Maxwell for her to use in the 
MDC. We were informed by the MDC Legal Department that they are only permitted to accept 
hard drives that are loaded and certified by the U.S. Attorney's Office. We have conferred with 
the government, which has advised that it does not object to the defense making an application to 
the Court to issue an order directing the MDC to accept the hard drives. The government 
requested, however, that the Court allow MDC legal counsel the opportunity to note their 
objections to the Court.

have.

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 1 of 34 
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
United States of America, 
—v—
Ghislaine Maxwell, 
Defendant. 
USDC SDNY 
DOCUMENT 
ELECTRONICALLY FILED 
DOC N: 
DATE FILED: 4/16/21 
20-cr-330 (AJN) 
OPINION & ORDER 
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
In June 2020, a grand jury returned a six-count indictment charging Ghislaine Maxwell 
with facilitating the late financier Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse of minor victims from around 
1994 to 1997. The Government filed a first (S1) superseding indictment shortly thereafter, 
which contained only small, ministerial corrections. The SI superseding indictment included 
two counts of enticement or transportation of minors to engage in illegal sex acts in violation of 
the Mann Act and two counts of conspiracy to commit those offenses. It also included two 
counts of perjury in connection with Maxwell's testimony in a civil deposition. Trial is set to 
begin on July 12, 2021. 
Maxwell filed twelve pretrial motions seeking to dismiss portions of the Si superseding 
indictment, suppress evidence, and compel discovery. After the parties fully briefed those 
motions, a grand jury returned a second (S2) superseding indictment adding a sex trafficking 
count and another related conspiracy count. 
This Opinion resolves all of Maxwell's currently pending pretrial motions other than 
those seeking to suppress evidence, which the Court will resolve in due course. The motions, and 
this Opinion, deal exclusively with the S 1 superseding indictment and do not resolve any issues 
EFTA00020261
--- PAGE 2 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 2 of 34 
related to the newly added sex trafficking charges. For the reasons that follow, the Court denies 
Maxwell's motions to dismiss the SI superseding indictment in whole or in part. It grants her 
motion to sever the perjury charges for a separate trial. It denies her motion to further expedite 
discovery. 
The Court provides a brief summary of its conclusions here and its reasoning on the 
pages that follow: 
• 
Maxwell moves to dismiss all counts based on a non-prosecution agreement between 
Jeffrey Epstein and the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida. The Court 
concludes that the agreement does not apply in this District or to the charged offenses. 
• 
Maxwell moves to dismiss all counts as untimely. The Court concludes that the 
Government brought the charges within the statute of limitations and did not unfairly 
delay in bringing them. 
• 
Maxwell moves to dismiss the Mann Act counts because they are too vague, or in the 
alternative to require the Government to describe the charges in greater detail. The 
Court concludes that the charges are specific enough. 
• 
Maxwell moves to dismiss the perjury counts because, in her view, her testimony 
responded to ambiguous questioning and was not material. The Court concludes that 
these issues are best left for the jury. 
• 
Maxwell moves to sever the perjury counts from the Mann Act counts so that they can 
proceed in a separate trial. The Court concludes that severance is appropriate and will 
try the perjury counts separately. 
• 
Maxwell moves to strike language from the indictment that she believes is superfluous 
and to dismiss conspiracy counts she believes are redundant. The Court concludes that 
these motions are premature before trial. 
• 
Maxwell moves to compel the Government to immediately disclose certain categories 
of evidence. The Court concludes that she is not entitled to do so, but the Court will 
order Maxwell and the Government to confer on a discovery schedule. 
• 
Maxwell moves to dismiss all counts because a grand jury in White Plains, rather than 
Manhattan, returned the  Si superseding indictment. Because a jury in Manhattan 
returned the S2 superseding indictment, the motion appears moot.

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 3 of 34 
I. 
Jeffrey Epstein's non-prosecution agreement does not bar this prosecution 
In September 2007, under investigation by both federal and state authorities, Jeffrey 
Epstein entered into a non-prosecution agreement ("NPA") with the Office of the United States 
Attorney for the Southern District of Florida. Dkt. No. 142 at 1-2. Epstein agreed in the NPA to 
plead guilty in Florida state court to soliciting minors for prostitution and to serve eighteen 
months in a county jail. Id. In exchange, the U.S. Attorney's Office agreed not to charge him 
with federal crimes in the Southern District of Florida stemming from its investigation of his 
conduct between 2001 and 2007. Id. It also agreed not to bring criminal charges against any of 
his "potential co-conspirators." Id. 
As a recent report from the Department of Justice's Office of Professional Responsibility 
observed, the NPA was unusual in many respects, including its breadth, leniency, and secrecy. 
OPR Report, Gov. Ex. 3, Dkt. No. 204-3, at x, 80, 175, 179, 260-61. The U.S. Attorney's 
promise not to prosecute unidentified co-conspirators marks a stark departure from normal 
practice for federal plea agreements. This provision appears to have been added "with little 
discussion or consideration by the prosecutors." Id. at 169, 185. The report concluded that the 
U.S. Attorney's negotiation and approval of the NPA did not amount to professional misconduct, 
but nonetheless reflected "poor judgment." Id. at 169. 
Only the NPA's effect, and not its wisdom, is presently before the Court. Maxwell 
contends that the NPA bars this prosecution, because she is charged as a co-conspirator of 
Jeffrey Epstein and the NPA's co-conspirator provision lacks any geographical or temporal 
limitations. The Court disagrees for two independent reasons. First, under controlling Second 
Circuit precedent, the NPA does not bind the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New 
York. Second, it does not cover the offenses charged in the S1 superseding indictment. 
EFTA00020263
--- PAGE 4 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 4 of 34 
A. The non-prosecution agreement does not bind the U.S. Attorney for the 
Southern District of New York 
United States Attorneys speak for the United States. When a U.S. Attorney makes a 
promise as part of a plea bargain, both contract principles and due process require the federal 
government to fulfill it. See Santobello v. New York, 404 U.S. 257, 262 (1971); United States v. 
Ready, 82 F.3d 551, 558 (2d Cir. 1996). The question here is not whether the U.S. Attorney for 
the Southern District of Florida had the power to bind the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District 
of New York. The question is whether the terms of the NPA did so. Applying Second Circuit 
precedent and principles of contract interpretation, the Court concludes that they did not. 
In United States v. Annabi, the Second Circuit held: "A plea agreement binds only the 
office of the United States Attorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it 
affirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction." 771 F.2d 670, 672 
(2d Cir. 1985) (per curiam). This is something akin to a clear statement rule. Single-district plea 
agreements are the norm. Nationwide, unlimited agreements are the rare exception. Applying 
Annabi, panels of the Second Circuit have stated that courts cannot infer intent to depart from 
this ordinary practice from an agreement's use of phrases like "the government" or "the United 
States." United States v. Salameh, 152 F.3d 88, 120 (2d Cir. 1998) (per curiam); United States v. 
Gonzalez, 93 F. App'x 268, 270 (2d Cir. 2004). Those are common shorthand. A plea 
agreement need not painstakingly spell out "the Office of the United States Attorney for Such-
and-Such District" in every instance to make clear that it applies only in the district where 
signed. 
Maxwell asks this Court to draw the opposite conclusion. The provision of the NPA 
dealing with co-conspirators does not expressly state that it binds U.S. Attorneys in other 
districts. It does not expressly state that it applies in other districts. The relevant language, in 
EFTA00020264
--- PAGE 5 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 5 of 34 
its entirety, reads as follows: "the United States also agrees that it will not institute any criminal 
charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein." Dkt. No. 142-1 at 5. Under Annabi, 
Salatneh, and Gonzalez, a statement that "the United States" agrees not to prosecute implies no 
restriction on prosecutions in other districts. 
Two provisions of the NPA refer specifically to prosecution in the Southern District of 
Florida. The first states that the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida will defer 
"prosecution in this District" if Epstein complies with the agreement. Dkt. No. 142-1 at 2. The 
second states that no prosecution "will be instituted in this District, and the charges against 
Epstein if any, will be dismissed" after he fulfills the agreement's conditions. Maxwell contends 
that the lack of similar language in the co-conspirator provision must mean that it lacks any 
geographical limitation. If anything, that language reflects that the NPA's scope was expressly 
limited to the Southern District of Florida. It is not plausible—let alone "affirmatively 
apparent", Annabi, 771 F.2d at 672,—that the parties intended to drastically expand the 
agreement's geographic scope in the single sentence on the prosecution of co-conspirators 
without clearly so saying. 
Without an affirmative statement in the NPA's text, Maxwell turns to its negotiation 
history. Under Second Circuit precedent she may offer evidence that negotiations of the NPA 
between the defendant and the prosecutors included a promise to bind other districts. See United 
States v. Russo, 801 F.2d 624, 626 (2d Cir. 1986). She alleges that officials in the U.S. 
Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida sought and obtained approval for the NPA 
from the Office of the Deputy Attorney General and communicated with attorneys in other 
districts. Any involvement of attorneys outside the Southern District of Florida appears to have 
been minimal. Maxwell has already received access to an unusually large amount of information 
EFTA00020265

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 6 of 34 
about the NPA's negotiation history in the form of the OPR report and yet identifies no evidence 
that the Department of Justice made any promises not contained in the NPA. The OPR report 
reflects that the Office of the Deputy Attorney General reviewed the NPA, but only after it was 
signed when Epstein tried to get out of it. OPR Report at 103. Other documents show that 
attorneys in the Southern District of Florida reached out to other districts for investigatory 
assistance but not for help negotiating the NPA. Dkt. No. 204-2. Nor would direct approval of 
the NPA by the Office of the Deputy Attorney General change the meaning of its terms. No 
evidence suggests anyone promised Epstein that the NPA would bar the prosecution of his co-
conspirators in other districts. Absent such a promise, it does not matter who did or did not 
approve it. 
Second Circuit precedent creates a strong presumption that a plea agreement binds only 
the U.S. Attorney's office for the district where it was signed. Maxwell identifies nothing in the 
NPA's text or negotiation history to disturb this presumption. The Court thus concludes that the 
NPA does not bind the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. 
B. The non-prosecution agreement does not cover the charged offenses 
The NPA would provide Maxwell no defense to the charges in the Si superseding 
indictment even against an office bound to follow it. The NPA bars prosecution, following 
Epstein's fulfillment of its conditions, only for three specific categories of offenses: 
(1) "the offenses set out on pages 1 and 2" of the NPA; namely, "any offenses that 
may have been committed by Epstein against the United States from in or around 
2001 through in or around September 2007" including five enumerated offenses; 
(2) "any other offenses that have been the subject of the joint investigation by the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States Attorney's Office"; and 
(3) "any offenses that arose from the Federal Grand Jury investigation." 
EFTA00020266
--- PAGE 7 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 7 of 34 
Dkt. No. 142-1 at 2. The NPA makes clear that the covered charges are those relating to 
and deriving from a specific investigation of conduct that occurred between 2001 and 2007. 
Maxwell contends that the NPA's co-conspirator provision lacks any limitation on the 
offenses covered. The Court disagrees with this improbable interpretation. The phrase 
"potential co-conspirator" means nothing without answering the question "co-conspirator in 
what?" The most natural reading of the co-conspirator provision is that it covers those who 
conspired with Epstein in the offenses covered by the NPA for their involvement in those 
offenses. Thus, it would cover any involvement of Maxwell in offenses committed by Epstein 
from 2001 to 2007, other offenses that were the subject of the FBI and U.S. Attorney's Office 
investigation, and any offenses that arose from the related grand jury investigation. 
The Court has no trouble concluding that the perjury counts are not covered by the NPA. 
Those charges do not relate to conduct in which Maxwell conspired with Epstein and stem from 
depositions in 2016, more than eight years after Epstein signed the NPA. Maxwell now 
concedes as much, though her motion sought to dismiss the Si superseding indictment in its 
entirety, perjury counts and all. 
The Mann Act counts, too, fall comfortably outside the NPA's scope. The Si 
superseding indictment charges conduct occurring exclusively between 1994 and 1997, some 
four years before the period covered by the Southern District of Florida investigation and the 
NPA. The NPA does not purport to immunize Epstein from liability for crimes committed 
before the period that was the subject of the FBI and U.S. Attorney's Office investigation. 
Maxwell's protection is no broader. The Court thus concludes that the NPA does not cover the 
offenses charged in the SI superseding indictment.

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 8 of 34 
C. Maxwell is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing 
In the alternative to dismissing the indictment, Maxwell requests that the Court conduct 
an evidentiary hearing as to the parties' intent in the NPA. The Court finds no basis to do so. 
The cases Maxwell cites where courts held hearings on the scope of a plea agreement 
mostly involved oral agreements where there was no written record of the full set of terms 
reached by the parties. All of them involved defendants with first-hand knowledge of 
negotiations who claimed prosecutors breached an oral promise. "An oral agreement greatly 
increases the potential for disputes such as . .. a failure to agree on the existence, let alone the 
terms, of the deal." United States v. Aleman, 286 F.3d 86, 90 (2d Cir. 2002). Thus, an 
evidentiary hearing may be necessary to determine the terms of an agreement never committed to 
writing. This is no such case. The NPA's terms are clear. Beyond the NPA itself, an extensive 
OPR report details its negotiation history. No record evidence suggests that prosecutors 
promised Epstein anything beyond what was spelled out in writing. The Court agrees with the 
Government that Maxwell's request for a hearing rests on mere conjecture. 
For the same reason, the Court will not order the discovery on the NPA. In any case, it 
appears that the Government has already produced two of the documents Maxwell seeks in her 
motion—the OPR report and notes mentioned in a privilege log. Of course, the Government's 
disclosure obligations would require it to disclose to Maxwell any exculpatory evidence or 
evidence material to preparing the defense, including any evidence supporting a defense under 
the NPA. The Government shall confirm in writing within one week whether it views any 
evidence supporting Maxwell's interpretation of the NPA as material it is required to disclose, 
and, if so, whether it has disclosed any and all such evidence in its possession.

II. 
The indictment is timely 
A. The indictment complies with the statute of limitations 
Federal law imposes a five-year limitations period for most non-capital offenses. 18 
U.S.C. § 3282(a). Recognizing the difficulty of promptly prosecuting crimes against children, 
Congress has provided a longer limitations period for "offense[s] involving the sexual or 
physical abuse, or kidnaping" of a minor. 18 U.S.C. § 3283. Until 2003, the operative version 
of § 3283 allowed prosecution of these offenses until the victim reached the age of twenty-five. 
Congress further extended the limitations period in the PROTECT Act of 2003, Pub. L. No. 108-
21, 117 Stat. 650, to allow prosecution any time during the life of the victim. 
The parties agree that the Mann Act charges are timely if subject to the PROTECT Act, 
but untimely under the general statute of limitations for non-capital offenses or the pre-2003 
version of § 3283. Maxwell contends that the charged offenses do not qualify as offenses 
involving the sexual or physical abuse or kidnapping of a minor and are thus governed by the 
general statute of limitations. Alternatively, she contends that the pre-2003 version of § 3283 
applies because the charged conduct occurred prior to 2003. The Court concludes that statute of 
limitations in the PROTECT Act applies and that the charges are timely. 
1. The Mann Act charges are offenses involving the sexual abuse of minors 
Maxwell does not dispute that the facts alleged in the SI superseding indictment involve 
the sexual abuse of minors. The indictment charges that Epstein sexually abused each of the 
alleged minor victims and that Maxwell allegedly enticed them to travel or transported them for 
that purpose. Instead, Maxwell contends that charged offenses do not qualify as offenses 
involving the sexual abuse of minors because sexual abuse is not an essential ingredient of each 
statutory offense. See Bridges v. United States, 346 U.S. 209, 221 (1953). In Maxwell's view, 
EFTA00020269
--- PAGE 10 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 10 of 34 
for example, it is possible to transport a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity 
and not follow through with the planned sexual abuse, and so sexual abuse is not an essential 
ingredient of the offense. Maxwell makes the same argument for the enticement and related 
conspiracy charges. 
This approach is analogous to the "categorical approach" employed by courts to evaluate 
prior convictions for immigration and sentencing purposes. See Taylor v. United States, 495 
U.S. 575, 602 (1990). Generally speaking, the "categorical approach" requires that courts "look 
only to the statutory definitions—i.e., the elements" of the relevant offense to determine if the 
provision applies "and not to the particular facts underlying those convictions." Descamps v. 
United States, 570 U.S. 254, 261 (2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). Whether a statute 
requires a categorical or case-specific approach is a question of statutory interpretation. To 
determine whether Congress used the word "offense" in a statute to refer to an offense in the 
abstract or to the facts of each individual case, the Court must examine the statute's "text, 
context, and history." United States v. Davis, 139 S. Ct. 2319, 2327 (2019). 
Though it has not authoritatively settled the question, the Second Circuit has strongly 
suggested that Maxwell's approach is the wrong one. In Weingarten v. United States, 865 F.3d 
48, 58-60 (2d Cir. 2017), the Second Circuit discussed at length how the text, context, and 
history of § 3283 show that Congress intended courts to apply the statute using a case-specific 
approach. The Third Circuit reached the same conclusion in United States v. Schneider, 801 
F.3d 186, 196 (3d Cir. 2015). 
The Court sees no reason to depart from the reasoning in Weingarten. First, "[t]he 
Supreme Court's modem categorical approach jurisprudence is confined to the post-conviction 
contexts of criminal sentencing and immigration deportation cases." Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 58. 
EFTA00020270
--- PAGE 11 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 11 of 34 
To the extent that the categorical approach is ever appropriate in other contexts, it is 
inappropriate here. 
The Court begins with the statute's text. Statutes that call for application of the 
categorical approach typically deal with the elements of an offense in a prior criminal conviction. 
Id. at 59. "The language of § 3283, by contrast, reaches beyond the offense and its legal 
elements to the conduct involv[ed]' in the offense. That linguistic expansion indicates Congress 
intended courts to look beyond the bare legal charges in deciding whether § 3283 applied." Id. at 
59-60 (alteration in original) (quoting § 3283). Maxwell cites one case holding otherwise, but 
that case involved a venue statute presenting significantly different concerns. See United States 
v. Morgan, 393 F.3d 192, 200 (D.C. Cir. 2004). The Supreme Court has likewise held that a 
statute which uses the language "an offense that . . . involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to 
the victim or victims exceeds $10,000" is "consistent with a circumstance-specific approach." 
Nijhawan v. Holder, 557 U.S. 29, 32, 38 (2009) (emphasis added). Thus, the word "involves" 
generally means that courts should look to the circumstances of an offense as committed in each 
case. This reading accords with a robust legislative history indicating that Congress intended to 
apply § 3283 to a wide range of crimes against children. See Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 60; 
Schneider, 801 F.3d at 196. 
The purposes underlying the categorical approach do not apply here either. For statutes 
dealing with prior convictions, "[t]he categorical approach serves `practical' purposes: It 
promotes judicial and administrative efficiency by precluding the relitigation of past convictions 
in minitrials conducted long after the fact." Moncrieffe v. Holder, 569 U.S. 184, 200-01 (2013). 
In the context of § 3283, there is no prior conviction to assess, and the jury will determine in the 
first instance whether "the defendant engaged in the applicable abusive conduct." Weingarten, 
EFTA00020271
--- PAGE 12 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 12 of 34 
865 F.3d at 60. Maxwell nonetheless contends that using a case-specific approach for § 3283 
would be impractical because the Government would need to prove conduct beyond the elements 
of the offense. It may be true that this approach requires the Government to prove some 
additional facts, but any statute-of-limitations defense presents factual issues (including, at least, 
when the alleged conduct took place). This is not a serious practical problem and does not 
justify setting aside the statute's language and apparent purpose. 
Maxwell relies primarily on Bridges v. United States, 346 U.S. 209 (1953), to urge this 
Court to cast Weingarten aside. The Supreme Court in Bridges addressed a statute that extended 
the limitations period for defrauding the United States during the Second World War. In that 
case, the Supreme Court first concluded that making false statements at an immigration hearing 
was not subject to the extended limitations period because it lacked any pecuniary element as 
required by the statute. Id. at 221. Then, as an alternative basis for its holding, it explained that 
the offense did not require fraud as an "essential ingredient." Id. at 222. It reached that 
conclusion in large part because the statute's legislative history made clear that Congress 
intended it to apply only to a narrow class of war frauds causing pecuniary loss. Id. at 216. 
As the Second Circuit explained in Weingarten, Congress had the opposite intent in the 
enacting in the PROTECT Act. Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 59 & n. 10. "In passing recent statutes 
related to child sex abuse, including extensions of the § 3283 limitations period, Congress 
`evinced a general intention to "'cast a wide net to ensnare as many offenses against children as 
possible."' Id. at 60 (quoting Schneider, 801 F.3d at 196 (quoting United States v. Dodge, 597 
F.3d 1347, 1355 (11th Cir. 2010) (en banc))). The primary basis for Bridges' holding—
legislative history supporting a narrow interpretation—does not exist here. Instead, both the 
statute's plan meaning and its legislative history suggest it should apply more broadly. 
EFTA00020272
--- PAGE 13 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 13 of 34 
Based on the statute's text, context, and history, the Court follows Weingarten and 
concludes that the appropriate inquiry is whether the charged offenses involved the sexual abuse 
of a minor on the facts alleged in this case. There is no question that they did. The Court thus 
concludes that § 3283 governs the limitations period for the charges here. 
2. The 2003 amendment to the statute of l"tations applies to these offenses 
Maxwell next contends that because the charged conduct took place before the 
PROTECT Act's enactment, that statute did not lengthen the statute of limitations applicable to 
her alleged offenses. Here too, the Second Circuit has provided guidance in its decision in 
Weingarten. Although the court did not provide a definitive answer there, it explained that the 
view Maxwell now takes conflicts with established principles of retroactivity and the decisions 
of at least two other circuit courts. Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 58 & n.8; see Cruz v. Maypa, 773 
F.3d 138, 145 (4th Cir. 2014); United States v. Leo Sure Chief, 438 F.3d 920, 924 (9th Cir. 
2006). 
The Supreme Court has set out a two-step framework to determine whether a federal 
statute applies to past conduct. See Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U.S. 244, 280 (1994). 
Courts look first to the language of the statute. If the statute states that it applies to past conduct, 
courts must so apply it. Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 54. Otherwise, the statute applies to past 
conduct unless doing so would create impermissible retroactive effects. Id. 
The Court begins with Landgraf s first step. To assess a statute's meaning here, courts 
must consider the text of the statute along with other indicia of congressional intent, including 
the statute's history and structure. See Enter. Mortg. Acceptance Co., LLC, Sec. Litig. v. Enter. 
Mortg. Acceptance Co., 391 F.3d 401, 406 (2d Cir. 2004). 
EFTA00020273

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 14 of 34 
Section 3283, as amended by the PROTECT Act, broadly states that "[n]o statute of 
limitations that would otherwise preclude prosecution for an offense involving the sexual or 
physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child under the age of 18 years shall preclude such prosecution 
during the life of the child." The statute lacks an express retroactivity clause, but courts have 
held that no such clause is necessary, including for this particular statute. See Leo Sure Chief, 
438 F.3d at 923. The statute's plain language unambiguously requires that it apply to 
prosecutions for offenses committed before the date of enactment. Instead of simply providing a 
new limitations period for future conduct, Congress stated that no statute of limitations that 
would otherwise preclude prosecution of these offenses will apply. That is, it prevents the 
application of any statute of limitations that would otherwise apply to past conduct. 
Courts have reached the same conclusion for other statutes employing similar language. 
The Eighth Circuit has held that the 1994 amendments to § 3283, which allowed prosecution of 
sex crimes against children until the victim reached age twenty-five, applied to past conduct. See 
United States v. Jeffries, 405 F.3d 682, 684-85 (8th Cir. 2005). The Second Circuit has observed 
that the Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-26, 105 Stat. 123, 
illustrates language that requires a statute's application to past conduct. See Enter. Mortg. 
Acceptance Co., LLC, Sec. Litig., 391 F.3d at 407. That statute eliminated the statute of 
limitations for claims on defaulted student loans by stating that "no limitation shall terminate the 
period within which suit may be filed." Id. The PROTECT Act's language is quite similar. 
The history of § 3283 confirms Congress's intent to apply the extended limitations period 
as broadly as the Constitution allows. With each successive amendment to the statute, Congress 
further extended the limitations period, recognizing that sex crimes against children "may be 
difficult to detect quickly" because children often delay or decline to report sexual abuse. 
EFTA00020274
--- PAGE 15 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 15 of 34 
Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 54. Congress enacted the limitations provision of the PROTECT Act 
because it found the prior statute of limitations was "inadequate in many cases." H.R. Conf. 
Rep. No. 108-63, at 54 (2003). For example, a person who abducted and raped a child could not 
be prosecuted beyond this extended limit—even if DNA matching conclusively identified him as 
the perpetrator one day after the victim turned 25." Id. 
Maxwell makes no argument based on the statute's text. Instead, she contends that 
because the House version of the bill included an express retroactivity provision absent from its 
final form, the Court should infer that Congress did not intend the statute to apply to past 
conduct. However, the legislative history makes clear that Congress abandoned the retroactivity 
provision in the House bill only because it would have produced unconstitutional results. The 
Supreme Court has explained that a law that revives a time-barred prosecution violates the Ex 
Post Facto Clause of the Constitution, but a law that extends an un-expired statute of limitations 
does not. Stogner v. California, 539 U.S. 607, 632-33 (2003). Senator Leahy, who co-
sponsored the PROTECT Act, expressed concerns in a committee report that the proposed 
retroactivity provision was "of doubtful constitutionality" because it "would have revived the 
government's authority to prosecute crimes that were previously time-barred." 149 Cong. Rec. 
S5137, S5147 (Apr. 10, 2003) (statement of Sen. Leahy). Congress removed the provision 
shortly thereafter for this reason. The removal of the express retroactivity provision shows only 
that Congress intended to limit the PROTECT Act to its constitutional applications, including 
past conduct—like Maxwell's—on which the statute of limitations had not yet expired. 
Both the text and history of the PROTECT Act's amendment to § 3283 reflect that it 
applies Maxwell's conduct charged in the SI superseding indictment. The Court could stop here. 
EFTA00020275
--- PAGE 16 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 16 of 34 
However, it also concludes that even if the statute were ambiguous, it would properly apply to 
these charges. 
At Lanfgraf s second step, the Court asks whether application of the statute to past 
conduct would have impermissible retroactive effects. IA] statute has presumptively 
impermissible retroactive effects when it 'takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under 
existing laws, or creates a new obligation, imposes a new duty, or attaches a new disability, in 
respect to transactions or considerations already past.'" Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 56 (quoting 
Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 290). Thus, applying a new statute of limitations to previously time-
barred claims has an impermissible retroactive effect. Enter. Mortg. Acceptance Co., LLC, Sec. 
Litig., 391 F.3d at 407. Applying it to conduct for which the statute of limitations has not yet 
expired does not. Vernon v. Cassadaga Valley Cent. Sch. Dist., 49 F.3d 886, 890 (2d Cir. 1995). 
Maxwell concedes that these offenses were within the statute of limitations when 
Congress enacted the PROTECT Act. Thus, the Act did not deprive her of any vested rights. 
Maxwell contends that it is unfair to allow the Government to prosecute her now for conduct that 
occurred more than twenty years ago, but there is no dispute that Congress has the power to set a 
lengthy limitations period or no limitations period at all. It has done so here, judging that the 
difficulty of prosecuting these offenses and the harm they work on children outweighs a 
defendant's interest in repose. Maxwell's fairness argument is a gripe with Congress's policy 
judgment, not an impermissibly retroactive application of the statute. The Court concludes that 
§ 3283 allows her prosecution now. 
B. The Government's delay in bringing charges did not violate due process 
"As the Supreme Court stated in United States v. Marion, the statute of limitations is 'the 
primary guarantee against bringing overly stale criminal charges."' United States v. Cornielle, 
EFTA00020276
--- PAGE 17 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 17 of 34 
171 F.3d 748, 751 (2d Cir. 1999) (cleaned up) (quoting United States v. Marion, 404 U.S. 307, 
322 (1971)). There is a strong presumption that an indictment filed within the statute of 
limitations is valid. To prevail on a claim that pm-indictment delay violates due process, a 
defendant must show both that the Government intentionally delayed bringing charges for an 
improper purpose and that the delay seriously damaged the defendant's ability defend against the 
charges. See id. This is a stringent standard. "Thus, while the [Supreme] Court may not have 
shut the door firmly on a contention that at some point the Due Process Clause forecloses 
prosecution of a claim because it is too old, at most the door is barely ajar." DeMichele v. 
Greenburgh Cent. Sch. Dist. No. 7, 167 F.3d 784, 790-91 (2d Cir. 1999). 
The Court sees no evidence that the Government's delay in bringing these charges was 
designed to thwart Maxwell's ability to prepare a defense. However, it is enough to say that 
Maxwell does not make the strong showing of prejudice required to support this sort of claim. 
Maxwell contends that the Government's delay in bringing charges has prejudiced her interests 
because potential witnesses have died, others have forgotten, and records have been lost or 
destroyed. It is highly speculative that any of these factors would make a substantial difference 
in her case. 
Maxwell first points to several potential witnesses who have passed away. These include 
Jeffrey Epstein and his mother, one individual Maxwell believes worked with one of the alleged 
victims in this case, and a police detective who investigated Epstein in Florida. She contends 
they all would have provided exculpatory testimony were they alive today. Courts have 
generally found that vague assertions that a deceased witness might have provided favorable 
testimony do not justify dismissing an indictment for delay. See, e.g., United States v. Scala, 388 
F. Supp. 2d 396, 399-400 (S.D.N.Y. 2005). The Court agrees with this approach. Maxwell 
EFTA00020277
--- PAGE 18 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 18 of 34 
provides no indication of what many of these potential witnesses might have testified to. The 
testimony she suggests the detective might have offered—that witnesses in the Palm Beach 
investigation did not identify Maxwell by name—is propensity evidence that does nothing to 
establish her innocence of the charged offenses. There are also serious doubts under all of the 
relevant circumstances that a jury would have found testimony from Epstein credible even if he 
had waived his right against self-incrimination and testified on her behalf. See United States v. 
Spears, 159 F.3d 1081, 1085 (7th Cir. 1999). 
Maxwell's arguments that the indictment should be dismissed because of the possibility 
of missing witnesses, failing memories, or lost records fail for similar reasons. These are 
difficulties that arise in any case where there is extended delay in bringing a prosecution, and 
they do not justify dismissing an indictment. United States v. Marion, 404 U.S. 307, 325-26 
(1971); see United States v. Elsbery, 602 F.2d 1054, 1059 (2d Cir. 1979). 
Finally, the Court finds no substantial prejudice from the pretrial publicity this case has 
garnered. Maxwell contends that lengthy public interest in this case has transformed her 
reputation from that of Epstein's friend to a co-conspirator. And she also alleges—without 
evidence—that her accusers fabricated their stories based on media allegations. The Court will 
not dismiss the indictment on Maxwell's bare assertion that numerous witnesses are engaged in a 
perjurious conspiracy against her. And the Court will take all appropriate steps to ensure that the 
pretrial publicity in this case does not compromise Maxwell's right to a fair and impartial jury. 
The Court thus concludes that Maxwell has failed to establish actual prejudice from the 
Government's delay in bringing charges. She may renew her motion if the factual record at trial 
shows otherwise. On the present record, neither the applicable statute of limitations nor due 
process bars the charges here.

III. 
The indictment describes the charged offenses with specificity 
Maxwell seeks to dismiss the Mann Act counts for lack of specificity or in the alternative 
to compel the Government to submit a bill of particulars providing greater detail of the charges. 
The Court concludes that the charges in the S1 superseding indictment are clear enough. 
Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7, an indictment must contain "a plain, 
concise, and definite written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged." 
The indictment must be specific enough to inform the defendant of the charges and allow the 
defendant to plead double jeopardy in a later prosecution based on the same events. United 
States v. Stavrouiakis, 952 F.2d 686, 693 (2d Cir. 1992). "Under this test, an indictment need do 
little more than to track the language of the statute charged and state the time and place (in 
approximate terms) of the alleged crime." United States. v. Tramunti, 513 F.2d 1087, 1113 (2d 
Cir. 1975). In addition to dismissal, "Rule 7(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 
permits a defendant to seek a bill of particulars in order to identify with sufficient particularity 
the nature of the charge pending against him, thereby enabling defendant to prepare for trial, to 
prevent surprise, and to interpose a plea of double jeopardy should he be prosecuted a second 
time for the same offense." United States v. Bortnovsky, 820 F.2d 572, 574 (2d Cir. 1987). 
The S1 superseding indictment sets out the elements of each charged crime and the facts 
supporting each element. Nonetheless, Maxwell contends that the indictment is too vague 
because it refers to open-ended time periods, describes conduct like "grooming" and 
"befriending" that is not inherently criminal, and does not identify the alleged victims by name. 
Maxwell's first argument fails because the Government need only describe the time and 
place of charged conduct "in approximate terms." Tramunti, 513 F.2d at 1113. The details are 
subject to proof at trial. "[T]he Second Circuit routinely upholds the 'on or about' language used 
EFTA00020279
--- PAGE 20 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 20 of 34 
to describe the window of when a violation occurred." United States v. Kidd, 386 F. Supp. 3d 
364, 369 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (quoting United States v. Nersesian, 824 F.2d 1294, 1323 (2d Cir. 
1987)). "This is especially true in cases of sexual abuse of children: allegations of sexual abuse 
of underage victims often proceed without specific dates of the offenses." United States v. 
Young, No. 08-cr-285 (KMK), 2008 WL 4178190, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 4, 2008) (collecting 
cases). As here, these cases frequently involve alleged abuse spanning a lengthy period of time, 
and witnesses who were victimized as children may struggle to recall the precise dates when 
abuse occurred. The indictment adequately describes the time and place of the charged conduct. 
Maxwell next contends that allegations of noncriminal conduct render the charges 
impermissibly vague. The Court disagrees. Rule 7 requires only that the language of the 
indictment track the language of the statute and provide a rough account of the time and place of 
the crime. Tram ;;;; ti, 513 F.2d at 1113. The language of the Si superseding indictment does so. 
The Government's decision to provide more details than those strictly required does not hamper 
Maxwell's ability to prepare a defense. Maxwell's argument that some of the conduct alleged is 
not inherently criminal goes to the merits of the Government's case, not the specificity of the 
charges. 
Finally, Maxwell argues that the indictment is vague because the government does not 
provide the names of the alleged victims. The Court sees no basis to require that the alleged 
victims' names be included the indictment. The names of victims, even if important, generally 
need not appear there unless their omission would seriously prejudice the defendant. See United 
States v. Stringer, 730 F.3d 120, 127 (2d Cir. 2013); United States v. Kidd, 386 F. Supp. 3d 364, 
369 (S.D.N.Y. 2019). Maxwell likely knows the identity of the alleged victims described in the 
indictment at this point because the Government has provided extensive discovery on them. 
EFTA00020280
--- PAGE 21 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 21 of 34 
Moreover, the Government has agreed to disclose their names in advance of trial. There is thus 
no unfairness here. See Stringer, 730 F.3d at 126. As discussed below, the Court will require 
the parties to negotiate and propose a full schedule for all remaining pretrial disclosures. 
IV. 
The perjury charges are legally tenable 
The Court turns next to Maxwell's motion to dismiss the perjury counts stemming from 
her answers to questions in a deposition in a civil case. She contends that these charges are 
legally deficient because the questions posed were fundamentally ambiguous and the questions 
were not material to the subject of the deposition. The Court concludes that the charges are 
legally tenable and Maxwell's defenses are appropriately left to the jury. 
The applicable perjury statute imposes criminal penalties on anyone who "in any 
proceeding before or ancillary to any court ... knowingly makes any false material declaration." 
U.S.C. § 1623(a). Testimony is perjurious only if it is knowingly false and is material to the 
proceeding in which the defendant offered it. 
A. The questions posed were not too ambiguous to support a perjury charge 
The requirement of knowing falsity requires that a witness believe that their testimony is 
false. United States v. Lighte, 782 F.2d 367, 372 (2d Cir. 1986). As a general matter, "[a] jury is 
best equipped to determine the meaning that a defendant assigns to a specific question." Id. 
Courts have acknowledged a narrow exception for questions that are so fundamentally 
ambiguous or imprecise that the answer to them cannot legally be false. Id. at 372, 375; see also 
United States v. Wolfson, 437 F.2d 862, 878 (2d Cir. 1970). A question is fundamentally 
ambiguous only if reasonable people could not agree on its meaning in context. Lighte, 782 F.2d 
at 375. The existence of some arguable ambiguity does not foreclose a perjury charge against a 
witness who understood the question. 
EFTA00020281
--- PAGE 22 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 22 of 34 
At a minimum, Maxwell's motion is premature. Courts typically evaluate whether a 
question was fundamentally ambiguous only after the development of a full factual record at 
trial. See, e.g., United States v. Markiewicz, 978 F.2d 786, 808 (2d Cir. 1992). The evidence at 
trial may shed further light on whether the questions posed were objectively ambiguous in 
context or whether Maxwell subjectively understood them. In any event, the Court has closely 
considered each of the categories of questions that Maxwell argues are ambiguous. None of the 
alleged ambiguities Maxwell identifies rise to the level supporting dismissal of the charges. The 
context of the questions and answers, in conjunction with the Government's evidence, could lead 
a reasonable juror to conclude that the statements were perjurious. Truth and falsity are 
questions for the jury in all but the most extreme cases. The Court declines to usurp the jury's 
role on the limited pretrial record. 
B. A reasonable juror could conclude that Maxwell's statements were material 
Maxwell also argues that the perjury counts should be dismissed because none of the 
allegedly false statements were material to the defamation action. In a civil deposition, a 
statement is material if it has a natural tendency to influence the court or if a truthful answer 
might reasonably lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. United States v. Gaudin, 515 
U.S. 506, 509 (1995); United States v. Kross, 14 F.3d 751, 753-54 (2d Cir. 1994). Like knowing 
falsity, materiality is an element of the offense and thus ordinarily must be "decided by the jury, 
not the court." Johnson v. United States, 520 U.S. 461, 465 (1997). Only the most extraordinary 
circumstances justify departure from this general rule. United States v. Forde, 740 F. Supp. 2d 
406, 412 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (citing Gaudin, 515 U.S. at 522-23). 
The charged statements do not fall within this narrow exception. Maxwell contends that 
the questions did not relate to the sex trafficking and sexual abuse allegations at the center of the 
EFTA00020282
--- PAGE 23 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 23 of 34 
civil case, but that is not the legal standard. The Government may prevail if it proves that 
Maxwell's answers could have led to the discovery of other evidence or could influence the 
factfinder in the civil case. See Gaudin, 515 U.S. at 509; Kross, 14 F.3d at 753-54. At trial, a 
reasonable juror could conclude that truthful answers to the questions may have permitted the 
plaintiff to locate other victims or witnesses who could have corroborated the plaintiff's 
testimony. The factual disputes relating to materiality are at least enough to preclude pretrial 
resolution. In criminal cases, courts must guard against "invading the 'inviolable function of the 
jury' in our criminal justice system," and if the "defense raises a factual dispute that is 
inextricably intertwined with a defendant's potential culpability, a judge cannot resolve that 
dispute on a Rule 12(b) motion." United States v. Sampson, 898 F.3d 270, 281 (2d Cir. 2018). 
The Court concludes that the perjury charges are legally tenable and appropriately 
presented to the jury. 
V. 
The perjury charges must be severed and tried separately 
Although the perjury charges are legally tenable, the Court concludes that the interests of 
justice require severing those counts and trying them separately. Trying the perjury counts 
together with the Mann Act counts would require admitting evidence of other acts likely to be 
unduly prejudicial. It would also risk disqualifying Maxwell's chosen counsel based on their 
involvement in the earlier civil case. 
Rule 14(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure allows a court to order separate 
trials if joining all offenses in a single trial would prejudice the defendant. A defendant seeking 
severance must show significant unfairness to outweigh the burden on the court of conducting 
multiple trials. United States v. Walker, 142 F.3d 103, 110 (2d Cir. 1998). The harm to the 
defendant must be more than "solely the adverse effect of being tried for two crimes rather than 
EFTA00020283
--- PAGE 24 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 24 of 34 
one." United States v. Werner, 620 F.2d 922, 929 (2d Cir. 1980). Though this standard is 
demanding, the Court concludes that, due to unique features of the perjury counts, Maxwell 
meets it here. Trying all counts together would compromise Maxwell's right to the counsel of 
her choice and risk an unfair trial. 
Trying the perjury counts together with the Mann Act counts would risk an unfair trial on 
each set of counts. First, it would introduce unrelated allegations of sexual abuse, which would 
potentially expose the jury to evidence that might otherwise not be admissible. In particular, a 
joint trial would potentially expose the jury to a wider swath of information regarding civil 
litigation against Epstein that is remote from Maxwell's charged conduct. This presents a 
significant risk that the jury will cumulate the evidence of the various crimes charged and find 
guilt when, if considered separately, it would not do so. See United States v. Halper, 590 F.2d 
422, 430 (2d Cir. 1978). Second, the evidence presented on the Mann Act counts may prejudice 
the jury's ability to fairly evaluate Maxwell's truthfulness in her deposition, a critical element of 
the perjury counts. The Court has concerns that a limiting instruction may be inadequate to 
mitigate these risks given the nature of the allegations involved. 
Importantly, a joint trial is also likely to require disqualification of at least one of 
Maxwell's attorneys from participating as an advocate on her behalf. The perjury counts likely 
implicate the performance and credibility of her lawyers in the civil action—two of whom 
represent her in this case. The New York Rules of Professional Conduct generally forbid a 
lawyer from representing a client in a proceeding in which the lawyer is likely also to be a 
witness. N.Y. R. Prof'/ Conduct § 3.7(a). Maxwell's counsel in the civil action and the 
deposition may be important fact witnesses on the perjury counts. Even if counsel were not 
required to testify, trying all counts together could force Maxwell to choose between having her 
EFTA00020284
--- PAGE 25 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 25 of 34 
counsel testify on her behalf on the perjury charges and having them assist her in defending the 
Mann Act charges. 
The Second Circuit has recognized that witness testimony offered by a party's attorney 
presents serious risks to the fairness of a trial. See Murray v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 583 F.3d 173, 
178 (2d Cir. 2009). The lawyer might appear to vouch for their own credibility, jurors might 
perceive the lawyer as distorting the truth to benefit their client, and blurred lines between 
argument and evidence might confuse the jury. Id. Disqualification of counsel also implicates 
Maxwell's Sixth Amendment right to be represented by the counsel of her choice. See, e.g., 
United States v. Kincade, No. 15-cr-00071 (JAD) (GWF), 2016 WL 6154901, at *6 (D. Nev. 
Oct. 21, 2016). The prejudice to Maxwell is especially pronounced because the attorneys who 
represented her in the civil case have worked with her for years and are particularly familiar with 
the facts surrounding the criminal prosecution. See United States v. Cunningham, 672 F.2d 
1064, 1070-71 (2d Cir. 1982). 
The Court is of course cognizant of the burden separate trials may impose on all trial 
participants. But much of the proof relevant to the perjury counts and the Mann Act counts does 
not overlap. In particular, materiality for statements made in a civil deposition is broad, and 
evidence on that question is unlikely to bear on the other charges here. See Kross, 14 F.3d at 
753-54; Gaudin, 515 U.S. at 509. Although some allegations of sexual abuse are relevant to 
both sets of charges, many are not. At a minimum, this will expand the scope of the trial far 
beyond the narrower issues presented. And while the Court agrees with the Government that at 
least some of Maxwell's concerns are overstated, there is little question that the jury's 
consideration of the nature of the defamation action will require a significant investment of time 
and resources to provide the requisite context. 
EFTA00020285
--- PAGE 26 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 26 of 34 
The balance of these considerations favors severance. "Motions to sever are committed 
to the sound discretion of the trial judge." United States v. Casarnento, 887 F.2d 1141, 1149 (2d 
Cir. 1989). In its discretion, the Court concludes that trying the perjury counts separately will 
best ensure a fair and expeditious resolution of all charges in this case. 
VI. 
Maxwell's motion to strike surplusage is premature 
Maxwell moves to strike allegations related to one of the alleged victims from the SI 
superseding indictment as surplusage. The Court declines to do so at this juncture. 
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(d) allows a court to strike surplusage from an 
indictment on a defendant's motion. "Motions to strike surplusage from an indictment will be 
granted only where the challenged allegations are not relevant to the crime charged and are 
inflammatory and prejudicial." United States v. Hernandez, 85 F.3d 1023, 1030 (2d Cir. 1996) 
(cleaned up). Courts in this District generally delay ruling on any motion to strike until after the 
presentation of the Government's evidence at trial, because that evidence may affect how 
specific allegations relate to the overall charges. See, e.g., United States v. Nejad, No. I 8-cr-224 
(MN), 2019 WL 6702361, at *18 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 6, 2019); United States v. Mostafa, 965 F. 
Supp. 2d 451, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 2013). 
Maxwell contends that the allegations related to "Minor Victim-3" are surplusage 
because the indictment does not charge that Minor Victim-3 traveled in interstate commerce or 
was below the age of consent in England where the alleged activities took place. Thus, she 
argues, these allegations do not relate to the charged conspiracy and instead reflect an attempt to 
introduce Minor Victim-3's testimony for impermissible purposes. 
The Court will not strike any language from the S 1 superseding indictment at this 
juncture. The standard under Rule 7(d) is "exacting" and requires the defendant to demonstrate 
EFTA00020286
--- PAGE 27 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 27 of 34 
clearly that the allegations are irrelevant to the crimes charged. United States v. Napolitano, 552 
F. Supp. 465, 480 (S.D.N.Y. 1982). The indictment does not allege that the alleged victim 
traveled in interstate commerce or was underage during sexual encounters with Epstein. But the 
Court cannot rule out that the allegations may reflect conduct undertaken in furtherance of the 
charged conspiracy or be relevant to prove facts such as Maxwell's state of mind. See United 
States v. Concepcion, 983 F.2d 369, 392 (2d Cir. 1992). The Court will follow the well-worn 
path of others in this District and reserve the issue for trial. Maxwell may renew her motion 
then. 
VII. 
Maxwell's motion to dismiss multiplicitous charges is premature 
Maxwell's motion to dismiss either the first or third count of the SI superseding 
indictment as multiplicitous is also premature. Maxwell contends that the Government has 
alleged the same conspiracy twice in the indictment. "An indictment is multiplicitous when it 
charges a single offense as an offense multiple times, in separate counts, when, in law and fact, 
only one crime has been committed." United States v. Chacko, 169 F.3d 140, 145 (2d Cir. 1999). 
"The multiplicity doctrine is based upon the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment, 
which assures that the court does not exceed its legislative authorization by imposing multiple 
punishments for the same offense." United States v. Nakashian, 820 F.2d 549, 552 (2d Cir. 1987) 
(cleaned up). 
"Where there has been no prior conviction or acquittal, the Double Jeopardy Clause does 
not protect against simultaneous prosecutions for the same offense, so long as no more than one 
punishment is eventually imposed." United States v. Josephberg, 459 F.3d 350, 355 (2d Cir. 
2006). "Since Josephberg, courts in this Circuit have routinely denied pre-trial motions to 
dismiss potentially multiplicitous counts as premature." United States v. Medina, No. 13-cr-272 
EFTA00020287
--- PAGE 28 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 28 of 34 
(PGG), 2014 WL 3057917, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. July 7, 2014) (collecting cases). The Court therefore 
denies Maxwell's motion to dismiss multiplicitous counts without prejudice. 
VIII. The parties shall negotiate all remaining disclosures 
Maxwell moves to compel the Government to produce certain documents she believes it 
has in its possession and has failed to produce. She also seeks accelerated disclosure of the 
Government's witness list, Jencks Act material, Brady and Giglio material, co-conspirator 
statements, and Rule 404(b) material. Based on the Government's response in briefing and 
letters the parties have since submitted to the Court, it appears that most of these requests have 
been overtaken by events. Accordingly, although the Court concludes that Maxwell is not 
entitled to expedite this discovery based on the arguments in her motion papers, the Court will 
require the parties to confer on an overall schedule for all remaining pretrial disclosures. 
A. The Court accepts the Government's representations that it has disclosed all 
Brady and Giglio Material 
The Supreme Court's decisions in Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963) and Giglio v. 
United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972) require the Government to disclose to defendants certain 
evidence that will aid their defense. Brady requires disclosure of exculpatory evidence. Under 
Giglio, the Government has a duty to produce "not only exculpatory material, but also 
information that could be used to impeach a key government witness." United States v. Coppa, 
267 F.3d 132, 135 (2d Cir. 2001) (citing Giglio, 405 U.S. at 154). As a general rule, "Brady and 
its progeny do not require immediate disclosure of all exculpatory and impeachment material 
upon request by a defendant." Id. at 146. "[A]s long as a defendant possesses Brady evidence in 
time for its effective use, the government has not deprived the defendant of due process of law 
simply because it did not produce the evidence sooner." Id. at 144. 
EFTA00020288
--- PAGE 29 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 29 of 34 
Maxwell requests an order directing immediate disclosure of all Brady and Giglio 
material and also requests a few specific documents she contends the Government has failed to 
disclose. The Court begins with the specific requests. The requested materials include (1) 
records of witness interviews in connection with an ex pane declaration in support of a response 
to a motion to quash subpoenas; (2) an unredacted copy of two FBI reports; (3) pages from a 
personal diary that is in the custody of a civilian third party; and (4) copies of all subpoenas the 
Government has issued for Maxwell's records as part of its investigation in this case. 
The Government represents that it is cognizant of its Brady obligations, that is has 
reviewed the witness interviews and one of the FBI reports, and that neither set of documents 
includes exculpatory information not previously disclosed. The Court has no reason to doubt the 
Government's representation in this case that it is aware of its Brady obligations and that it has 
complied and will continue to comply with them. And because the witness statements are 
covered by the Jencks Act, the Court cannot compel production of such statements under the 
terms of the statute. See 18 U.S.C. § 3500; Coppa, 267 F.3d at 145. Next, the Government 
represents that it has already produced an unredacted copy of the other requested FBI report, and 
so that request is moot. The diary pages she requests are within the control of a civilian third 
party, not the Government, and so the Government need not (and perhaps cannot) produce them. 
See United States v. Collins, 409 F. Supp. 3d 228, 239 (S.D.N.Y. 2019). Finally, Maxwell's 
request for copies of all subpoenas the Government has issued is overly broad and lacks a legal 
basis. Maxwell is not entitled to compel production of these documents. 
The Court also will not issue an order requiring the immediate disclosure of Brady and 
Giglio material. The Government has represented that it recognizes its obligations under Brady 
and that it has complied, and will continue to comply, with such obligations. The Court has no 
EFTA00020289
--- PAGE 30 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 30 of 34 
reason to doubt these representations given its expansive approach to document production thus 
far in this case. The Government has agreed in its recent letter to produce Giglio material six 
weeks in advance of trial. The parties shall negotiate the specific timing, but assuming a 
schedule along those lines is met, the Court concludes that Maxwell will be able to effectively 
prepare for trial. See Coppa, 267 F.3d at 144. 
B. Jencks Act material and co-conspirator statements 
Maxwell also seeks to expedite discovery of Jencks Act material and non-exculpatory 
statements of co-conspirators that the government may offer at trial. The Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. 
§ 3500, "provides that no prior statement made by a government witness shall be the subject of 
discovery until that witness has testified on direct examination." Coppa, 267 F.3d at 145. The 
statute therefore prohibits a district court in most cases from ordering the pretrial disclosure of 
witness statements unless those statements are exculpatory. "A coconspirator who testifies on 
behalf of the government is a witness under the Act." In re United States, 834 F.2d 283, 286 (2d 
Cir. 1987). The Court therefore lacks the inherent power to expedite these disclosures. In any 
case, the Government has agreed to produce all Jencks Act material at least six weeks in advance 
of trial. 
The Court also rejects Maxwell's alternative request for a hearing to determine the 
admissibility of co-conspirator declarations. Co-conspirator statements may often be admitted at 
trial on a conditional basis. If the Court determines that the Government has not met its burden 
to show that the conditionally admitted statements were made in furtherance of the charged 
conspiracy, the Court should provide a limiting instruction or, in extreme cases declare a 
mistrial. United States v. Tracy, 12 F.3d 1186, 1199 (2d Cir. 1993). Although conditional 
admissions can pose a problem, a pretrial hearing is unnecessary here because the Government 
EFTA00020290
--- PAGE 31 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 31 of 34 
has committed to producing co-conspirator statements at least six weeks in advance of trial to 
allow Maxwell to raise any objections. Maxwell will have adequate time to object to any 
proffered co-conspirator testimony following the Government's Jencks Act disclosures. 
C. Witness list 
As a general matter, "district courts have authority to compel pretrial disclosure of the 
identity of government witnesses." United States v. Cannon, 528 F.2d 296, 300 (2d Cir. 1975). 
In deciding whether to order accelerated disclosure of a witness list, courts consider whether a 
defendant has made a specific showing that disclosure is "both material to the preparation of the 
defense and reasonable in light of the circumstances surrounding the case." United States v. 
Bejasa, 904 F.2d 137, 139-140 (2d Cir. 1990) (cleaned up). 
Maxwell has made a particularized showing that the Government must produce a witness 
list reasonably in advance of trial. The nature of the allegations in this case—decades-old 
allegations spanning multiple locations—present considerable challenges for the preparation of 
the defense. However, the Government's proposed disclosure schedule—which will afford 
Maxwell at least six weeks to investigate testifying witness statements—allows Maxwell 
significantly more time to review disclosures than schedules adopted in most cases in this 
District. See, e.g., United States v. Rueb, No. 00-CR-91 (RWS), 2001 WL 96177, at *9 
(S.D.N.Y. Feb. 5, 2001) (thirty days before trial); United States v. Nachamie, 91 F. Supp. 2d 565, 
580 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (fourteen days before trial). In addition, on April 13, 2021, the 
Government produced over 20,000 pages of interview notes, reports and other materials related 
to non-testifying witnesses. After considering the circumstances, including the complexity of the 
issues in this case and what the defense has already received and likely learned in the course of 
discovery, the Court concludes that the Government's proposal is generally reasonable. 
EFTA00020291
--- PAGE 32 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 32 of 34 
D. Rule 404(b) material 
Maxwell's final discovery request is for early disclosure of evidence the Government 
seeks to offer under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(6). Under Rule 4O4(b), if the prosecutor in a 
criminal case intends to use "evidence of a crime, wrong, or other act" against a defendant, the 
prosecutor must "provide reasonable notice of the general nature of any such evidence that the 
prosecutor intends to offer at trial" and must "do so in writing before trial—or in any form 
during trial if the court, for good cause, excuses lack of pretrial notice." The Government 
represents that it will notify the defense of its intent to use 404(b) evidence at least 45 days in 
advance of trial to allow Maxwell to file any motions in limine to be considered at the final 
pretrial conference. The Government's proposal will give Maxwell an opportunity to challenge 
admission of that evidence and to bring to the Court's attention any issues that require resolution 
before trial. "This is all that Rule 404(b) requires." United States v. Thompson, No. 13-cr-378 
(AJN), 2013 WL 6246489, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3, 2013). The Court concludes this schedule is 
generally reasonable, although additional time to enable briefing and resolution in advance of 
trial is strongly encouraged. 
The Court's denial of Maxwell's requests to compel pretrial disclosures does not preclude 
the parties from negotiating in good faith for an expedited discovery timeline that will account 
for Maxwell's specific concerns. "[I]n most criminal cases, pretrial disclosure will redound to 
the benefit of all parties, counsel, and the court." United States v. Percevault, 490 F.2d 126, 132 
(2d Cir. 1974). In general, the Court will require the parties to negotiate a final, omnibus 
schedule to propose to the Court. The Court concludes that the disclosure of all of the above

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 33 of 34 
Given the complexities of the case and the addition of two counts via the S2 indictment, the 
Court encourages the parties to agree to approximately eight weeks. 
IX. 
The S2 superseding indictment moots Maxwell's grand jury challenge 
The Court has not received supplemental briefing on the motions in light of the return of 
the S2 superseding indictment and so does resolve any such issues here.' However, Maxwell's 
motion seeking to dismiss the Si superseding indictment because it was returned by a grand jury 
sitting at the White Plains courthouse appears moot. Maxwell argued that the use of a grand jury 
drawn from the White Plains Division in this District did not represent a fair cross-section of the 
community, because her trial would proceed in the Manhattan Division. A grand jury sitting in 
Manhattan returned the S2 superseding indictment. By April 21, 2021, Maxwell shall show 
cause why her grand jury motion should not be dismissed on that basis. 
Conclusion 
The Court DENIES Maxwell's motions to dismiss the indictment as barred by Epstein's 
non-prosecution agreement (Dkt. No. 141), to dismiss the Mann Act counts as barred by the 
statute of limitations (Dkt. No. 143), to dismiss the indictment for pre-indictment delay (Dkt. No. 
137), to dismiss the Mann Act counts for lack of specificity (Dkt. No. 123), to dismiss the 
perjury counts as legally untenable (Dkt. No. 135), to strike surplusage (Dkt. No. 145), to 
dismiss count one or count three as multiplicitous (Dkt. No. 121), and to expedite pretrial 
disclosures (Dkt. No. 147). The Court GRANTS Maxwell's motion to sever the perjury counts 
for a separate trial (Dkt. No. 119). 
' The parties shall negotiate and propose a schedule for any available additional or supplement rulings in 
light of the filing of the S2 indictment.

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 34 of 34 
The Court ORDERS the Government to confirm within one week whether it considers 
any evidence related to negotiation of the non-prosecution agreement to constitute Brady or Rule 
material and, if so, to confirm that it has or will disclose such evidence. 
The Court further ORDERS the parties to negotiate a final schedule for all pretrial 
disclosures that remain outstanding, including: Brady, Giglio, and Jenks Act materials, including 
co-conspirator statements; non-testifying witness statements; testifying witness statements; the 
identity of victims alleged in the indictment; 404(b) material; and the Government's witness list. 
The Court also requires the parties to negotiate a schedule for any additional or supplemental 
motions briefing in light of the S2 indictment. The Court ORDERS a joint proposal to be 
submitted by April 21, 2021. If agreement is not reached, the parties shall submit their 
respective proposals. 
The Court further ORDERS Maxwell to show cause by April 21, 2021 why her motion to 
dismiss the SI superseding indictment under the Sixth Amendment (Dkt. No. 125) should not be 
denied as moot. 
SO ORDERED.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
United States of America,

Defendant. 
USDC SONY

ELECTRONICALLY FILED 
DOC 0: 
DATE FILED: 4/27/21 
20-CR-330 (MN) 
ORDER 
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell seeks an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to Rule 
17(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. As detailed in the subpoena and Maxwell's 
moving papers, she seeks authorization to serve a subpoena to the law firm of Boies, Schiller and 
Flexner LLP. BSF has filed a letter in opposition to the subpoena request. Additionally, the 
Government submitted a letter requesting that it be given notice of all pending and future 
subpoenas applications, an opportunity to challenge them, and copies of any documents 
produced. For the reasons that follow, the Court denies Maxwell's motion as to Requests 1 
through 8 and Request 12 and reserves judgment on Requests 9 through 11. The Court also 
denies the Government's requests, though it will direct the Government to notify the Court of its 
views as to Requests 9 through 11. 
I. 
Legal Standard 
Rule 17(c) permits subpoenas ordering the production of "books, papers, documents, 
data, or other objects." Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(1). When the subpoena seeks the production of 
personal or confidential information about a victim, it may be served on a third party only by 
court order. Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(3). 
EFTA00020298
--- PAGE 2 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 252 Filed 04/27/21 Page 2 of 9 
The purpose of Rule 17(c) is to facilitate the trial by designating a time and place prior to 
trial to obtain and inspect evidentiary material. See United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 698-99 
(1974) (citing Bowman Dairy Co. v. United States, 341 U.S. 214, 220 (1951)). It is not intended 
to provide an additional means of discovery or to serve as a general "fishing expedition." Id. at 
698-700. As a result, courts must be mindful not to allow the Rule 17(c) process to become a 
"broad discovery device" that would undermine the discovery procedures set forth in Rule 16. 
United States v. Cherry, 876 F. Supp. 547, 552 (S.D.N.Y. 1995). Thus, if an item is not 
discoverable under Rule 16, a party cannot make it discoverable simply by subpoenaing it under 
Rule 17. United States v. Barnes, No. S9 04-CR-186 (SCR), 2008 WL 9359654, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. 
Apr. 2, 2008). 
To determine whether issuance of the subpoena is appropriate, the Court considers the 
factors articulated in United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. at 699-700. In Nixon, the Supreme Court 
explained that in order to require production prior to trial, the moving party must show: (1) that 
the documents are evidentiary and relevant; (2) that they are not otherwise procurable reasonably 
in advance of trial by exercise of due diligence; (3) that the party cannot properly prepare for 
trial without such production and inspection in advance of trial and that the failure to obtain such 
inspection may tend unreasonably to delay the trial; and (4) that the application is made in good 
faith and is not intended as a general `fishing expedition."' Id. at 698-700. To clear that hurdle, 
the Court considers (1) relevancy, (2) admissibility, and (3) specificity. Id. at 700. 
II. 
Discussion 
A. The BSF Subpoena 
The proposed subpoena makes twelve requests. Some of the requests relate to documents 
that Maxwell believes will be relevant at trial. For others, the proffered relevance relates to 
EFTA00020299
--- PAGE 3 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 252 Filed 04/27/21 Page 3 of 9 
Maxwell's pending motions to suppress evidence. While ordinarily Rule 17(c) is "trial-focused" 
and "may be used only to obtain materials admissible as evidence at trial," at least some courts 
have held that Rule 17(c) can be used to compel the production of documents in connection with 
a suppression hearing. United States v. Louis, No. 04-CR-203 (LTS), 2005 WL 180885, at *3 
(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 27, 2005). Even then, the requests fail for the reasons stated below. 
Requests 1 through 5 all fail on the basis that they do not comply with Nixon's specificity 
requirement. Requests 1 through 5 all target communications between "any" owner, 
shareholder, partner or employee of BSF and government officials or co-counsel in civil 
litigation, from 2015 to the date of the subpoena. While the requests focus on a certain subject, 
the requests are so overbroad that issuance of the Rule 17(c) subpoena would be improper. As 
set forth in the subpoena, the term "communications" encompasses "all forms of correspondence, 
including regular mail, email, text message, memorandum, or other written communication of 
information of any kind." The use of the terms "all" and "any" "do not evince specificity." 
United States v. Tagliaferro, No. 19-CR-472 (PAC), 2021 WL 980004, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 16, 
2021). Here, the requests do not identify specific lawyers or employees of BSF whose 
communications are relevant. See United States v. Wey, 252 F. Supp. 3d 237, 243 (S.D.N.Y. 
2017) (discussing that while an originally requested subpoena was insufficiently specific, a new 
requested subpoena satisfied the specificity requirement because it identified a specified set of 
individuals whose records were sought). The requests also encompass "all" forms of 
correspondence without limitation. And while the requested subpoenas are limited to the period 
between 2015 and 2021, the timeframe is still overly broad. These requests are precisely the 
kind of "fishing expedition" that the specificity requirement is designed to prevent. See Bowman 
Dairy Co., 341 U.S. at 221. Indeed, the requests are akin to discovery requests in civil litigation. 
EFTA00020300
--- PAGE 4 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 252 Filed 04/27/21 Page 4 of 9 
See United States v. Avenatti, No. (SI) I9-CR-373 (PGG), 2020 WL 86768, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. 
Jan. 6, 2020). But Rule 17(c) subpoenas are not tools of discovery. Nixon, 418 U.S. at 698; 
Wey, 252 F. Supp. 3d at 253. On the specificity prong alone, Requests 1 through 5 fail to satisfy 
the Nixon standard. 
Requests 1 and 2 fail for the separate reason that, if Maxwell is entitled to the materials 
sought at all, they should come from the Government. Requests 1, 2, and 8 all seek documents 
that are procurable from the Government. As noted above, Requests 1 and 2 seek 
communications between BSF and government officials regarding a certain subject, from 2015 
to the date of the subpoena. Request 8, meanwhile, refers to a specific grand jury subpoena that 
the Government issued to BSF. As to all of these requests, Maxwell asserts that the Rule 17(c) 
subpoena is necessary to fix what she deems to be the Government's failure to comply with its 
discovery obligations. Among the principles set forth in Nixon is that the materials must not be 
otherwise procurable reasonably in advance of trial by exercise of due diligence. Nixon, 418 
U.S. at 699. These three requests target information that reasonably can be expected to be in the 
hands of the Government. To the extent that Maxwell has a basis to argue that the Government 
has not met its discovery obligations, the Rule 17(c) subpoena process is not the proper 
mechanism for pursuing that. Rather, with notice to the Government so that the issue is properly 
joined, Maxwell must make some showing of that failure and seek specific and appropriate relief 
from this Court. 
Requests 6 and 7 seek contingency fee agreements or engagement letters between BSF 
and two of its clients who are alleged victims. Maxwell has failed to make the required showing 
under Nixon that these records would be relevant or admissible for purposes of her Rule 17(c) 
application. The only plausible theory of relevance set forth in Maxwell's papers is that these 
EFTA00020301
--- PAGE 5 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 252 Filed 04/27/21 Page 5 of 9 
documents are necessary for purposes of impeachment. But as a general matter, the need to 
impeach witnesses generally "is insufficient to require [materials'] production in advance of 
trial." Nixon, 418 U.S. at 701. Many courts have held that impeachment material does not 
become relevant until after the witness testifies. United States v. Skelos, No. 15-CR-317 
(ICMW), 2018 WL 2254538, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May 17, 2018), ), aff'd, 988 F.3d 645 (2d Cir. 
2021) (collecting cases); United States v. Scaduto, No. 94-CR-311 (WK), 1995 WL 130511, at 
(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 27, 1995) ("Potentially impeaching statements `ripen into evidentiary 
material. . . only if and when the witness testifies at trial...." (citation omitted)). See also 
Avenatti, 2020 WL 86768, at *6 (rejecting the argument that the defendant needed the recordings 
in question prior to trial in order "to demonstrate witnesses' bias or self-interest."). The 
arguments as to relevance are otherwise specious, and the Court cannot discern what relevance 
the materials responsive to Requests 6 and 7 may have. In any event, there is little risk that 
review of these materials, if they become relevant and admissible, will lead to a delay at trial, 
given their limited volume. United States v. Seabrook, No. I6-CR-467, 2017 WL 4838311, at *2 
(S.D.N.Y. Oct. 23, 2017). For documents that may ripen into relevance if and when the BSF 
clients testify, Maxwell presumably could request that the Court issue a subpoena to require 
production of the engagement letters to the Court so that the information can be made available 
to Maxwell, if appropriate, at the conclusion of each witness's direct testimony. See United 
States v. Giampa, No. S 92-CR-437 (PKL), 1992 WL 296440, at *3 *4 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 7, 1992); 
United States v. Ferguson, No. 3:06-CR-137 (CFD), 2007 WL 4577303, at *3 (D. Conn. Dec. 
26, 2007). 
Maxwell also argues that compulsion of the materials' production under Rule 17(c) is 
justified because the materials appear not to have been produced by BSF in response to the grand 
EFTA00020302
--- PAGE 6 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 252 Filed 04/27/21 Page 6 of 9 
jury subpoena at issue in Request 8; she thus contends that the absence of the documents in that 
production suggests coordination between the Government and BSF. Other than through 
conclusory speculation, she fails to explain how the contents of those letters may be relevant to 
her theory of preexisting coordination between the Government and BSF. Furthermore, to the 
extent Maxwell argues that the Government may have the documents and has refused to produce 
them in contravention of Brady or Giglio, the argument is little more than an attempt to 
circumvent the discovery processes that are in place. The production of Giglio material has not 
yet happened, and so any claim that the Government has failed to produce these documents 
consistent with its Giglio obligations is premature. Furthermore, as set forth in the Opinion & 
Order resolving some of Maxwell's pre-trial motions, the Government has represented in good 
faith that it is cognizant of its Brady obligations and that it has complied and will continue to 
comply with them. This Court knows well that the Government has not always lived up to those 
obligations in every case. But nothing has transpired that provides any reason to doubt the good 
faith representations that have been made to the Court by the AUSAs appearing here. In sum, 
none of Maxwell's theories justify production of these documents under the Rule 17(c) process. 
Request 12, which seeks "any" submission to the Epstein Victims' Compensation 
Program made by BSF, fails under the relevance prong of the Nixon standard. The request seeks 
"any" submission made by BSF to the EVCP. In its reply brief, BSF represents that Maxwell 
offered to narrow this request to just those materials submitted on behalf of victims who 
ultimately testify in this action. 
The request's failure to satisfy the Nixon standard is in part due to its relative lack of 
specificity, for even if Maxwell had established the relevance of some evidence captured by this 
request, she plainly has not demonstrated the relevance of all materials submitted to the EVCP. 
EFTA00020303
--- PAGE 7 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 252 Filed 04/27/21 Page 7 of 9 
See United States v. Aguilar, No. CR 07-00030 (SBA), 2008 WL 3182029, at *6 (ND. Cal. Aug. 
4, 2008). Maxwell argues that the materials are relevant because they may reveal monetary 
incentives to testify in a particular way. That argument demonstrates that the documents are 
being sought for impeachment. As stated above, the mere fact that certain documents might be 
impeachment evidence does not render them "relevant" for purposes of Rule 17(c); if at all, those 
documents would become relevant only after a witness testifies. See Skelos, 2018 WL 2254538, 
at *2. Maxwell's argument that the documents are relevant because their impeachment value is 
exculpatory does not get around this general bar. These materials only become relevant if or 
when those witnesses testify. She presents no other nonconclusory basis as to why they are 
exculpatory. Indeed, Maxwell concedes that the primary purpose of these documents will be for 
purposes of cross-examination, leaving little doubt as to the purported claim of relevance. And 
to the extent Maxwell posits that statements made as part of the EVCP process may be 
exculpatory in themselves, the argument is speculative because she provides no basis for why 
that expectation might be reasonable. The "mere hope" that the documents may contain some 
exculpatory evidence is insufficient to justify enforcement of a Rule 17(c) subpoena (or, as here, 
issuance of such a subpoena in the face of objections). See United States v. Rich, No. S 83-CR-
579 (SWK), 1984 WL 845, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 7, 1984). Maxwell's reliance on cases 
involving the Government's obligations under Brady and Giglio to produce impeachment 
evidence prior to trial are thus inapposite to the current context. Pena, 2016 WL 8735699, at *2-
3. Maxwell thus fails to establish Request 12's compliance with the Nixon standards. Maxwell 
may renew her request for these documents once she identifies specific individuals whose 
submissions she seeks and spells out with specificity the relevance of all requested materials. At 
that time, the Court will determine whether it is proper to require production of these materials to 
EFTA00020304
--- PAGE 8 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 252 Filed 04/27/21 Page 8 of 9 
the Court so that the information may be made available to Maxwell, if appropriate, at the 
conclusion of each witness's direct testimony. See Giampa, 1992 WL 296440, at *3; Ferguson, 
2007 WL 4577303, at *3. 
The Court will reserve on Requests 9 through II in order to allow the Government to 
weigh in on the propriety of the requests. The Court assumes that the Government has enough 
information, based on the public filings, to provide its views. If the Government seeks the 
specific subpoena requests, it shall confer with defense counsel and raise any dispute with the 
Court. The Government shall file its response within one week of this Order. 
In sum, for Request 1 through 8 and 12, the Court will not authorize service of the 
proposed subpoena on the basis that Maxwell has failed to establish that the requests are 
sufficiently specific and that the materials sought are relevant or admissible. Maxwell may 
renew more tailored requests in compliance with this Order. The Court sees no basis for doing 
so on an ex parte basis. For Requests 9 through 11, the Court will reserve its decision until it 
hears from the Government. 
B. The Government's Subpoena-Related Request 
The Government seeks a preemptive, blanket ruling that it be entitled notice of all future 
subpoenas, an opportunity to challenge them, and production of any information obtained 
therefrom. This request is denied. Assuming Maxwell seeks the issuance of a future subpoena 
for which there is no basis to proceed ex parte, the Government will be provided notice and the 
Court would likely consider the Government's briefing regardless of standing as part of its duty 
to ensure that the subpoena meets the requirements of Nixon. See United States v. Bergstein, No. 
I6-CR-746 (PKC), 2017 WL 6887596, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 28, 2017). But ex parte Rule 17(c) 
subpoenas are possible in some circumstances if justified. See Sicelos, 2018 WL 2254538, at *8 
EFTA00020305
--- PAGE 9 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 252 Filed 04/27/21 Page 9 of 9 
(collecting cases). As a result, the blanket ruling sought by the Government is improper and 
denied. 
III. 
Conclusion 
The Defendant's motion for an order authorizing the subpoena pursuant to Rule 17(c)(3) 
is DENIED. The Government is ORDERED to respond to Requests 9 through 11 of the 
proposed subpoena within one week of this Order.

ORDER 
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
Last summer, the Court scheduled trial in this matter to commence on July 12, 2021. On 
March 29, 2021, three and a half months before trial, the Government filed an S2 Superseding 
Indictment. As a result of the late filing of the S2, counsel for Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell 
request a continuance of the trial date until either fall 2021 or January 2022. t The Government 
opposes any continuance, but requests that if one is granted it be until March of 2022. Having 
carefully considered the parties' respective positions, the Court GRANTS Maxwell's request for 
a short continuance until the fall of 2021 to allow the defense to prepare for the additional 
charges brought in the S2 indictment. The Court rejects Maxwell's alternative request to 
continue the trial date until January of 2022 and the Government's alternative proposal that the 
Court adjourn trial until March of 2022. 
The Court bases its decision on a number of factors. First, the filing of the S2 indictment 
has added a significant burden to the defense's preparation for trial. The new indictment alleges 
The alternative request by Maxwell resulted from a conflict among lawyers involved in both this case and a 
criminal matter before Judge Furman, which is discussed in defense counsel's letter. Dkt. No. 246 at 4. The Court 
has been informed that Judge Furman has adjourned the trial date with respect to two defendants. The Court 
presumes that this eliminates the September through December conflict for one of Maxwell's defense counsel. It 
presumably does not eliminate the conflict for one of the AUSAs involved in both cases. Dkt. No. 235 at 10 n.5.

that the conspiracies charged in Counts I and 3 extended to 2004 (the S I charged through 1997), 
identifying a fourth alleged victim, Minor Victim-4. It also adds two new charges: Count 5 of 
the S2 Indictment charges Maxwell with participating in a sex trafficking conspiracy between 
2001 and 2004, and Count 6 charges Maxwell with participating in the sex trafficking of a minor 
or aiding and abetting the same. Dkt. No. 187. These additions will require the defense to (1) 
review a substantial amount of discovery that is now potentially relevant as a result of the S2 
Indictment; (2) re-review discovery that it had previously considered in light of the changes to 
the case against her; (3) conduct new investigations based on the new charges, including 
potential interviews of new witnesses; and (4) re-evaluate her trial preparation and strategy. 
Second, although jury trials have resumed in the district and conditions in MDC and around the 
country are improving, the defendant's and defense counsel's preparation efforts to date have 
been and to some extent continue to be hampered by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. As 
the Government indicated in explaining the delay in filing the new charges, travel constraints and 
other safety concerns resulting from the pandemic have slowed trial preparation and complicated 
the logistics of conducting investigations. See Dkt. No. 199 at 2. Third, defense counsel must 
balance preparing for trial with considering and preparing any supplemental pre-trial motions in 
response to the new charges contained in the S2 Indictment. Although the perjury counts were 
recently severed, the Court cannot conclude that this sufficiently offsets the additional burdens 
placed on the defense as a result of the new charges and expanded timeframe resulting from the 
S2 indictment. 
The Court is very mindful of the countervailing considerations that require that any 
adjournment be no longer than necessary. For one, the Defendant, whose counsel strenuously 
request the adjournment, is detained pre-trial. Moreover, with many lawyers on both sides of 
EFTA00020308
--- PAGE 3 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 266 Filed 05/03/21 Page 3 of 3 
this case, any adjournment runs the risk of precluding some attorneys from being able to 
participate and/or requiring them to seek adjustments to schedules in other matters. And, 
importantly, any victims and the public more broadly have a strong interest in trial proceeding 
without undue delay. It is the Court's obligation to ensure that the case proceed to that trial as 
expeditiously as possible, taking into account the interests of justice and all relevant 
circumstances. See 18 U.S.C. §3161(h)(7)(A); 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(7). 
Having balanced all of the factors outlined above, the Court concludes that the interests 
of justice justify granting a short continuance. The Court deems an adjournment until fall 2021 
to be reasonable. Such an adjournment would plainly give the defense team sufficient time to 
prepare for trial in light of the additional charges contained in the S2 indictment while also 
ensuring that the trial proceeds without undue delay. No additional delay is necessary or in the 
interests of justice. 
The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and by May 10, 2021, they shall 
jointly propose a trial start date for the Court to request of the Clerk's Office (as is required by 
COVID protocols). The Court urges counsel to agree to the earliest possible date this fall and to 
seek adjustments to other schedules in order to facilitate an early fall trial start date. The parties 
shall also discuss and propose any adjustments necessary to the pre-trial schedule in place. Dkt. 
No. 250. The Government may move in the letter for any requested exclusion of time under the 
Speedy Trial Act. 
SO ORDERED.

Inline-Images: image00 Ljpg 
All, 
We have considered your proposal. Unfortunately, it does not permit us an adequate ability to review the evidence in the 
case and does not permit our client to meaningfully participate in her own defense. 
First, we are unable to meaningfully review the evidence without the benefit of our laptops and other electronic devices 
which are needed to take notes of our review. We also need access to our devices during the review to compare the 
physical evidence with the electronic discovery and with our work product. 
Second, we need to provide our client the ability to review all discovery, including any recordings, in order to assist in her 
own defense. Presuming that she will not be taken to the FBI downtown office, then your proposal offers no means by 
which she can both inspect a recording in its physical form and listen to the recording at the same time. 
In order to address the deficiencies in your proposal, we believe the following are necessary: 
Physical Evidence 
• All of the physical evidence currently located in the FBI Bronx warehouse will be transported to 500 Pearl Street 
and made available during the week of April 12, with our client present, in a room sufficiently large to 
accommodate 8 attorneys and investigators. 
o We do not need the "bulky" massage tables transported; if there are any other extremely large evidence 
pieces, let us know what they are and we can consider whether we can have someone review and 
photograph those at the Bronx warehouse at an earlier time. 
o From your email, it appears that only two items are not located at the Bronx warehouse — both envelopes 
with cash. Please confirm this. We do not need the two "cash" evidence items transported to 500 Pearl. 
o If there are other evidence items housed somewhere other than the Bronx, please let us know what they are 
and where they are. 
• We will be permitted to bring our laptops, and a camera, into 500 Pearl Street; we are happy to seek permission 
from Judge Nathan to do so. 
• Either the FBI can provide the equipment necessary to listen to any of the recordings at 500 Pearl Street or we can 
bring the necessary equipment. If we are to provide the equipment, we will need to know in advance the formats 
of each recording so that we can be prepared. You can note that on your Excel spreadsheet by the item number by 
March 29 to give us adequate time to secure the necessary equipment. 
• The FBI can segregate any physical evidence that you deem "highly confidential." You can identify any "highly 
confidential" physical evidence items on your Excel spreadsheets by April 5 (one week before the evidence view). If 
we need to photograph or reproduce any such item for expert evaluation, we will seek leave of court. Otherwise, 
we will not photograph any such items during the review during the week of April 12. This will ensure the evidence 
review proceeds smoothly and there will not be any need to ask permission to photograph on an item by item 
basis. 
• The FBI also can segregate any recordings which we will be able to inspect, but not listen to, during the evidence 
view the week of April 12. You can note such designation on your Excel spreadsheet. If we disagree, we can seek 
EFTA00020322
--- PAGE 2 ---
leave of the Court in advance. 
• We understand that an FBI Agent and/or AUSA may be present during our physical evidence review at 500 Pearl 
Street but of course must ensure that no recordings are made of our conversations and also ensure that there is a 
separate, secure room in which we can confer with our client during the evidence view without monitoring by the 
government. 
• Please confirm whether all electronic recordings (other than the highly-confidential images and videos described 
below) have previously been produced to us, and if not, please explain which ones were not produced by the 
discovery deadlines last fall and why. 
Highly Confidential Electronic Evidence 
• Can you please explain why 2,100 + 7 "highly confidential" images have not been shared with us yet? It was our 
understanding that you previously provided all "highly confidential" images to our client — and to defense counsel —
for review at the MDC in November. We are confused about where these previously undisclosed items were 
located and why they have not yet been made available for inspection and review. 
• During the week of April 19, Ms. Maxwell should be produced to 500 Pearl Street to review (with counsel and a 
defense staff member, on the 1 laptop provided) all of the 5,507 electronic images and video marked "highly 
confidential". These should be segregated into the three categories you describe (never-before produced, 
previously produced, and the 7 hard-copy images). 
Please let us know if you will not agree to any of these steps so that we can address the issues with the Court. 
Thank you.

Subject: RE: US v. Maxwell - 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) - Request to view evidence, highly confidential materials, scenes 
All, 
Attached please find two spreadsheets documenting all physical evidence in the FBI's custody, as well as a corresponding 
discovery cover letter. We are sending a copy of these files to the MDC for your client as well. 
In response to your questions, the FBI has informed me of the following: 
Regarding the Highly Confidential nude/partially nudge images to be reviewed at 500 Pearl: 
• There are three categories of these images: 
o Approximately 2,100 electronic images and videos seized from Epstein's electronic devices (which have not 
been previously provided to you) 
o Approximately 3,400 electronic images from discs seized from Epstein's residences in 2019 (which have 
previously been provided to you and your client for review at the MDC) 
o Approximately 7 hard copy nude images located in the file from the FBI Florida office's investigation of 
Epstein (which have not been previously provided to you) 
• The FBI will make all three of those categories available to you. The electronic files will be provided on hard drives, 
and the FBI will provide you with the hard copy images for review as well. 
EFTA00020323
--- PAGE 3 ---
o All electronic images should be viewable as thumbnails, except those seized from Apple devices, which must 
be viewed using Cellebrite. 
o The Cellebrite software will be provided on the drive for your review of images and videos seized from Apple 
devices. 
o The electronic files have the same metadata on the hard drive that was available when the FBI seized each 
image. For images that were carved or deleted, no metadata was recovered, so none is viewable. For all 
other images, the metadata recovered should be viewable on the hard drive. 
o The approximately 2,100 electronic images and videos seized from Epstein's devices are separated by folder 
to indicate which device each image was seized from. 
• Because these images are considered obscene material, the FBI is not permitted to make duplicates of them, and 
there is a limited number of clean laptops on which these images can be reviewed. As a result, the FBI is only able 
to provide a single laptop for review of these images. 
Regarding the physical evidence: 
• Attached are two lists of all physical items in the FBI's custody relating to this case. The first list relates to items 
associated with the FBI Florida office's investigation of Epstein. The second list relates to items associated with the 
FBI New York office's current investigation. 
• The vast majority of physical evidence in the FBI's custody is located at the FBI's warehouse in the Bronx. Two 
items (18 77 & 1B 79) are located at 26 Federal Plaza, but the case agents can check those items out from 26 
Federal Plaza and bring them to the Bronx warehouse on whatever day you choose to conduct your review so that 
you will have all evidence in one place. 
• The FBI is able to arrange for the defense team to review all physical evidence at the Bronx warehouse under the 
following conditions: 
o The warehouse requires at least two weeks' notice in order to pull all of the items for the entire case and 
place them in a location where a large group of people can view them. 
o The warehouse is open during normal business hours between 9am and 5pm on weekdays. 
o At least two FBI agents and an AUSA will be present at the Bronx warehouse to assist and answer questions. 
o The evidence will be placed in a loading dock at the warehouse to provide additional space for the review. 
To ensure that there is sufficient space, please let me know how many members of the defense team intend 
to be physically present for this review. 
o Electronic devices such as cellphones and laptops are not permitted in the warehouse. The defense team 
may bring a digital camera that is not connected to the Internet or a cellular network into the warehouse. If 
the defense team wishes to photograph an item of evidence, the defense will need to inform the agents who 
are present, so that they may confirm that the photographed item is not Highly Confidential based on the 
presence of nudity. 
o Electronic media such as VHS tapes, cassette tapes, and CDs will not be playable at the warehouse. 
• To the extent the defense requests that the FBI bring any physical items to 500 Pearl Street for your client to review, 
the FBI is prepared to bring items that are reasonably sized to 500 Pearl Street. With respect to bulky or large 
items, the defense team should be able to photograph those for your client to review, unless they are deemed 
Highly Confidential, in which case the FBI can make arrangements to transport the item to 500 Pearl Street if 
necessary. 
• The FBI is in the process of confirming that it can provide devices to play all of the electronic media in the case in a 
single location at the FBI's offices in downtown Manhattan. We are also double-checking to confirm that all media 
that does not contain witness statements have already been produced to you and your client in discovery. The FBI 
anticipates that we can arrange for you to review all non-witness statement electronic media at the FBI's office in 
downtown Manhattan in approximately three weeks. 
o To the extent you wish to review all of the discs containing photographs, which were seized from Epstein's 
residences in 2019, we note that all of those images have already been produced to you in discovery. For 
your awareness, the FBI has informed me that it took their team several weeks to review all of the images on 
all of those discs. 
Please let me know how you wish to proceed. 
Best,

Now that the FBI team is back, when do you expect to have answers to all of the questions posed? If I had an idea of 
when you would have answers, it could help me answer your question. 
EFTA00020325
--- PAGE 5 ---
At a minimum, it would not seem to take too much time to know when someone can open the FBI vault and allow the 
attorneys to make an initial view of the evidence. Also, I understand the FBI did not prepare an inventory of their 
evidence when they seized it from NY and LSJ, so I don't think we need to wait for them to now prepare an inventory 
before we start reviewing evidence. 
Also, when do you believe you will have a response regarding the discovery I requested last Monday? 
Thanks, 
Laura

Counsel, 
The FBI team on this case has been out of the office this week and will not be able to answer all of the questions you 
asked during our Wednesday call until they are back in the office next week. Please let me know if you would like to wait 
until all of those questions can be answered to schedule a day for your client to be brought to 500 Pearl Street to review 
the highly confidential images. My understanding is that the FBI is able to provide at least one laptop containing those 
highly confidential images in time for such a review to take place on Thursday 5/18, but I may not have the answers to all 
of your questions about those images before that date, and I do not know whether you will also be able to visit the 
evidence vault that same week. 
Please let me know how you would like to proceed. I will reach back out once I have answers to your questions. 
Thank you,

That is the only excel spreadsheet indexing physical evidence that we have produced in discovery. That spreadsheet does 
not include every physical item currently in the FBI's custody related to this case. For example, the August 20, 2020 
discovery production also included search warrant returns listing the physical items seized by the FBI's New York Office 
during the 2019 searches of Jeffrey Epstein's residences in New York and the U.S Virgin Islands (see Bates range 
SDNY_GM_00166007-SDNY_GM_00166043), but they are not contained in a spreadsheet. 
As a courtesy, I have asked the FBI whether it would be possible to provide us with a similar excel index reflecting the 
physical evidence seized by the FBI's New York Office, though it may take some time to compile such an index.

In advance of our call tomorrow, I wanted to send a copy of the attached index of physical items in FBI custody from the 
FBI-Miami office, which we previously produced to you as part of our August 21, 2020 discovery production. Also 
included in that August 21, 2020 production were scans of numerous items listed on the index. Those scans can be found 
within Bates range SDNY_GM_00172218-SDNY_GM_00173007. It may be useful to reference some of those items during 
our conversation tomorrow, so I wanted to make sure you were aware of them.

Wanted to get this to the chiefs today to expedite review, but obviously welcome any thoughts or comments from you 
guys. I based the new language primarily on the language from our past Epstein and Maxwell indictments, so hopefully 
nothing too controversial.

I understand you're supposed to be filing a response today (by 5:00?) to a defense motion to have Maxwell 
released to the general population at MDC, or at least to be detained under conditions they say would allow her 
greater access to a computer and the opportunity to review discovery materials? Main (OPA) is keenly interested 
because of the AG's response last summer to Epstein's suicide and his bow to overhaul BOP and ensure inmate 
safety, so a guy down there asked if we could send him what you file as soon as you do. (Apparently the AG is 
getting questions from Congressional Republicans about what's being done to ensure Maxwell's safety.)

Hi, 
Our Jeffrey Epstein team here is working on gathering material that may be discoverable in our case 
or pertinent to an anticipated motion by Epstein for dismissal based on the S.D.Fla. agreement. We assume you 
had to pull together a lot of discovery for the CVRA litigation, and that you probably have a good sense of where 
else, or with whom else, in the S.D.Fla., we might need to look for pertinent information. The attorne s in the 
N.D.Ga. who are handling the CVRA litigation said we should check directly with you, and ADAG 
cleared us to reach out to you directly on this. Would you have some time this week for us to give you a call

Hey I'm sorry, I neglected to include info about the next hearing date — let's please use the following instead, and thanks 
again: 
On July 2, 2020, the United States Attorney's Office announced the unsealing of federal felony charges against GHISLAINE 
MAXWELL on charges of enticement of a minor to engage in illegal sex acts, transportation of a minor to engage in illegal 
sex acts, conspiracy, and perjury. These crimes are alleged to have occurred in locations including, but not limited to, New 
York, Florida, New Mexico, and the United Kingdom. 
The next conference, which will include an arraignment and bail hearing, is scheduled for Tuesday, July 14, 2020, at 1:00 
p.m. before the Honorable Alison J. Nathan, United States District Judge for the Southern District of New York. This 
proceeding will occur as a remote video / teleconference using an internet platform. Members of the public may access 
an audio feed of the proceeding by calling a dial-in number, which the Court will provide in advance of the proceeding. 
Pursuant to the Crime Victims' Rights Act, Title 18, United States Code, Section 3771(a)(4), a crime victim has the right to

Team, apologies again for the delay on this (among other things — and you'll be entertained by this — 
*!!), but draft is attached. It is as strong as I could think to make it, but very happy to take additional thoughts or 
suggestions, and I anticipate we'll likely get some pushback but we can see what they say. Thoughts / comments / edits? 
Thanks.

Chris, Mark, and Jeff, 
We are writing to let you know that the FBI arrested your client this morning in Bradford, New Hampshire. I have 
attached the indictment and arrest warrant, which we are providing to you as a courtesy while we seek the formal 
unsealing of the indictment at SDNY this morning. We will let you know when a district judge is assigned at SONY. The 
defendant is currently being transported for arrest processing by the FBI, and our current expectation is that she will be 
presented this afternoon in the District of New Hampshire, via remote proceedings. We will update you as we learn more. 
and =Ind I are available for a call later this morning, if that would be useful. Please let us know what time 
would be convenient for you.

I hope each of you had a good weekend. Please find language below that has been approved by FBI NY, VSD 
executive management and our OGC rep. I'm more than happy to have a call if you would like to discuss. 
The FBI's Victim Services Division (VSD) is committed to providing services and support to victims of crimes 
committed by Jeffrey Epstein. Though this particular indictment is focused on specific individuals, you are still 
entitled to your rights, resources, and referrals as a federal victim independent of this indictment. An overview 
of these services is available at www.fbi.gov/resources/victim-services. If you would like to speak with a Victim 
Specialist, or if you have any questions regarding your rights to victim services and referrals, please email 
victimservices@fbi.gov.

Thanks so much,. I was actually able to scan my version of 
signature the other day. Attached is a subpoena 
from another case with that signature included. Would you please insert it into all of these subpoenas for the Korea case? 
Couple other corrections: 
• 
All of the riders appear to have a typo in the sentence beginning "A list of accounts hold, controlled, or accessible 
to the following individual(s) and/or entity(ies)," which should instead read "A list of accounts held controlled, or 
accessible to". Would you please fix that before sending out? 
• 
There are a couple instances in which the word "Alaska" is misspelled (it's written "Alaksa" in the riders). Would 
you please correct those? 
• 
Some of the riders have highlighting in them—would you please remove that? 
With those changes, these are good to go out. 
Thanks,

Amended Application for Second Warrant and Order 
for Cellphone Location and Pen Register Information 
The United States of America, by its attorney, Audrey Strauss, Acting United States 
Attorney for the Southern District of New York, 
Assistant United States 
Attorney, of counsel, respectfully requests that the Court issue the accompanying proposed Second 
Warrant and Order for prospective and historical location information and pen register information 
for a cellphone. As grounds for this Amended Application the Government relies on the following 
facts and authorities. 
I. Introduction 
. I am an Assistant United States Attorney in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern 
District of New York. 
This Amended Application is submitted in conjunction with the 
accompanying amended affidavit of a law enforcement agent ("Amended Agent Affidavit"), to be 
sworn before this Court, and incorporated by reference herein. I make this Amended Application 
based on information and belief, including the Amended Agent Affidavit, my review of other 
documents in the case, and information received from investigative personnel. 
2. The Investigating Agency, Target Cellphone, Subscriber, Target Subject, Service 
Provider, Subject Offenses, Successor Service Provider, and Successor Cellphone referenced in 
this Amended Application are as specified in the Amended Agent Affidavit.

II. Legal Authority 
A. Prospective Location Information 
3. The Government seeks to obtain both precision location information and cell site data 
for the Target Cellphone on a prospective basis (the "Prospective Location Information") for a 
period of 45 days from the date of this order — the same period of time for which a warrant for a 
tracking device may be granted under Rule 41(e)(2)(C). It bears noting, however, that while the 
Prospective Location Information may permit "tracking" the user of the phone in the colloquial 
sense, this is not an application for a warrant for a "tracking device" as defined in Fed. R. Crim. 
P. 41(a)(2)(E) and 18 U.S.C. § 3117(b). Those provisions only apply where an agent is seeking to 
physically install a tracking device on a given object. 
Instead, the Prospective Location 
Information will be obtained by requiring the Service Provider to provide the information. 
4. The authority for this application is found in 18 U.S.C. § 2703(c)(1), which authorizes 
a court of competent jurisdiction to require any electronic communication service provider (which 
includes a cellular telephone service provider') to disclose any "record or other information 
pertaining to a subscriber" other than the "contents of communications," when the government 
obtains, inter cilia, a warrant under the applicable procedures of Rule 41. See 18 U.S.C. § 
2703(cX1)(A). Because data concerning a subscriber's location, such as precision location 
information and cell site data, constitutes "information pertaining to a subscribe?' that does not 
include the "contents of communications," that data is among the types of information available 
See 18 U.S.C. § 2711(1) (incorporating by cross-reference statutory definitions set forth in 18 
U.S.C. § 2510); 18 U.S.C. § 2510(15) (defining "electronic communication service" as "any 
service which provides to users thereof the ability to send or receive wire or electronic 
communications"). 
2019.07.24 
EFTA00020373
--- PAGE 3 ---
under § 2703(c)(1)(A).2 Further, as specified in 18 U.S.C. § 2711(3), this Court is a court of 
competent jurisdiction under the Stored Communications Act because it has jurisdiction over the 
Subject Offenses. 
5. The Government's request for cell site data also implicates the pen register statute, 
because such data constitutes signaling information used by the Service Provider to mute 
communications to and from the Target Cellphone. In order to collect such data, a valid pen 
register order is required.3 Accordingly, I hereby certify pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3122 that such 
signaling information is relevant to an ongoing investigation being conducted by the Investigating 
Agency into suspected violations of the Subject Offenses by the Target Subject. 
B. Historical Location Information 
6. The Government also seeks historical cell site data for the Target Cellphone for the 
period from June I, 2020 to the present (the "Historical Location Information"). Because such 
data—like "Prospective Location Information"—constitutes information concerning a subscriber, 
the Court is authorized to order the Service Provider to provide this data pursuant to a warrant 
See In re Application, 460 F. Supp. 2d 448, 459-60 & n. 55 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (Kaplan, J.) 
(cellphone location information falls within § 2703(c)(1)); accord, e.g., United States v. Caraballo, 
963 F. Supp. 2d 341, 361 (D.Vt. 2013); In re Order, 632 F. Supp. 2d 202, 207 (E.D.N.Y. 2008); 
In re Application, 405 F. Supp. 2d 435, 444-45 (S.D.N.Y. 2005). But see In re Application, 849 
F. Supp. 2d 526, 574 (D.Md. 2011) (rejecting view that cellular location data falls within the scope 
of the SCA and finding that phone must be treated as "tracking device" for purposes of Rule 41 
where used to collect location data); In re Application, 2009 WL 159187, at *5 *6 (S.D.N.Y. 
Jan.13, 2009) (McMahon, J.) (same). 
See 18 U.S.C. § 3121 (prohibiting use of pen register or trap and trace device without an order 
under the pen register statute); 3127(3) & (4) (defining pen register and trap and trace device to 
include devices or processes that record, inter alio, signaling information). Although cell site data 
constitutes "signaling" information within the meaning of the pen register statute, a separate statute 
precludes the Government from relying "solely" on the authority provided by the pen register 
statute to ascertain a subscriber's location. 47 U.S.C. § 1002(a). Here, the Government seeks to 
obtain such data pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2703(c) as well as the pen register statute, rather than 
"solely" under the latter statute. See In re Application, 460 F. Supp. 2d at 456-59. 
2019.07.24 
EFTA00020374
--- PAGE 4 ---
application under 18 U.S.C. § 2703(c), under the applicable procedures of Rule 41. See 18 U.S.C. 
§ 2703(c)(1)(A). I respectfully submit that the same probable cause supporting the Government's 
request for a warrant to obtain the Prospective Location Information requested above also supports 
the issuance of a warrant under § 2703(c) for the requested Historical Location Information. In 
addition, the Government seeks toll records for the same period as the Historical Location 
Information. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2703(d), I respectfully submit that the Amended Agent 
Affidavit offers specific and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe 
that the toll record information sought is relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation. 
C. Pen Register Information 
7. Finally, the Government seeks an order pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §§ 3121-26 authorizing 
the use of a pen register on the Target Cellphone for a period of 45 days from the date of this order. 
Specifically, the Government seeks an order directing the Service Provider to furnish any 
information, facilities, and technical assistance necessary to operate, unobtrusively and with 
minimum disruption of service, a pen register and trap and trace device to capture all dialing, 
routing, addressing, or signaling information associated with each call transmitted to or from the 
Target Cellphone, as specified further in the proposed Second Warrant and Order (the "Pen 
Register Information").4
The Government is also not seeking authorization to obtain post-cut-through dialed digits 
("PCTDD"), or digits that are dialed after a telephone call from the Target Cellphone has been 
connected. Pursuant to the attached Order, if possible, the Service Provider will forward only pre-
cut-through-dialed digits to the Investigating Agency. 
However, if the Service Provider's 
technical capabilities require it to forward all dialed digits, including PCTDD, to the Investigating 
Agency, the Investigating Agency will only decode and forward to the agents assigned to the 
investigation the numbers that are dialed before the call is cut through. 
2019.07.24 
EFTA00020375
--- PAGE 5 ---
8. I hereby certify pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3122 that the Pen Register Information is 
relevant to an ongoing investigation being conducted by the Investigating Agency into suspected 
violations of the Subject Offenses by the Target Subject. 
D. Sealing and Non-Disclosure Order to Service Provider 
9. When the Government obtains records or information under § 2703(c), it is not required 
to notify the subscriber or customer. 18 U.S.C. § 2703(c)(3). Additionally, the Government may 
obtain an order precluding the Service Provider from notifying the subscriber or any other third-
party of the warrant or order obtained, for such period as the Court deems appropriate, where there 
is reason to believe that such notification will result in endangering the life or physical safety of 
an individual, flight from prosecution, destruction of or tampering with evidence, or intimidation 
of potential witnesses, or will otherwise seriously jeopardize the investigation. 18 U.S.C. 
§ 2705(b). 
10. Further, 18 U.S.C. § 3I23(d) provides that an order directing installation of a pen 
register or trap and trace device shall direct the pertinent service provider "not to disclose the 
existence of the pen register or trap and trace device or the existence of the investigation to the 
listed subscriber, or to any other person unless or until otherwise ordered by the Court." 
II. Accordingly, as explained further in the Amended Agent Affidavit, in light of the 
confidential nature of the continuing criminal investigation and the adverse consequences expected 
in the event of premature notification, the Government respectfully requests that the Court direct 
the Service Provider not to notify the Subscriber or any other person of the Second Warrant and 
Order sought herein for a period of one year, subject to extension upon application to the Court, if 
necessary. 
12. For similar reasons, I respectfully request that the proposed Second Warrant and Order, 
this Amended Application, and the accompanying Amended Agent Affidavit, be maintained under 
2019.07.24 
EFTA00020376
--- PAGE 6 ---
seal until the Court orders otherwise, except that the Government be permitted without further 
order of this Court to serve this Second Warrant and Order on the Service Provider; provide copies 
of the Second Warrant and Order or the supporting Amended Application and Amended Agent 
Affidavit as need be to personnel assisting the Government in the investigation and prosecution of 
this matter; and disclose these materials as necessary to comply with discovery and disclosure 
obligations in any prosecutions related to this matter. 
III. Prior Requests 
13. As set forth in the Amended Agent Affidavit, the Government previously requested 
Cellphone Location and Pen Register information for the Target Cellphone in an Application and 
Agent Affidavit submitted on or about June 29, 2020.5 Also on or about June 29, 2020, United 
States Magistrate Judge Katharine H. Parker granted the application and signed a Warrant and 
Order for the requested information. On June 30, 2020, the Government learned that the Agent 
Affidavit contained two inadvertent errors. Accordingly, the Government is submitting this 
Amended Application and Amended Agent Affidavit to correct those errors and to seek a Second 
Warrant and Order. 
The original application also sought authorization for Cellphone Location and Pen Register 
information for a second Target Cellphone, 
, which was identified as Target 
Cellphone-1 in that application and which was also granted on or about June 29, 2020. Because 
there were no errors in the application with respect to Target Cellphone-1, the Government does 
seek a Second Warrant and Order with respect to that phone.

Amended Agent Affidavit in Support of Second Warrant and Order 
for Cellphone Location and Pen Register Information 
STATE OF NEW YORK 
) 
) ss. 
COUNTY OF NEW YORK ) 
being duly sworn, deposes and states: 
1. Introduction 
1. 1 have been a Special Agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI" or 
"Investigating Agency") since 2017. As such, I am a "federal law enforcement officer within the 
meaning of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41(a)(2)(C), that is, a government agent engaged 
in enforcing the criminal laws and duly authorized by the Attorney General to request a search 
warrant. I am currently assigned to investigate violations of criminal law relating to the sexual 
exploitation of children as part of an FBI Task Force. I have gained expertise in this area through 
classroom training and daily work related to these types of investigations. As part of my 
responsibilities, I have been involved in the investigation of cases involving sex trafficking, 
enticement of minors, and transportation of minors for illegal sex acts, and have participated in the 
execution of search warrants involving electronic evidence. 
2. Requested Information. I respectfully submit this Affidavit pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 
§§ 2703(c) and (c)(1)(A) and the applicable procedures of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41; 
2019.07.24 
EFTA00020379
--- PAGE 9 ---
U.S.C. §§ 2703(d) & 2705; and 18 U.S.C. §§ 3121-3126, in support of a second warrant and 
order for prospective location information, historical location information, toll records, and pen 
register information, for the Target Cellphone identified below (collectively, the "Requested 
Information"). 
3. Basis for Knowledge. This Affidavit is based upon my participation in the 
investigation, my examination of reports and records, and my conversations with other law 
enforcement agents and other individuals, as well as my training and experience. Because this 
Affidavit is being submitted for the limited purpose of obtaining the Requested Information, it 
does not include all the facts that I have learned during the course of this investigation. Where the 
contents of documents and the actions, statements, and conversations of others are reported herein, 
they are reported in substance and in part, except where otherwise indicated. In addition, unless 
otherwise indicated, statements by others referenced in this Affidavit were not necessarily made 
to me, but may have been provided to me by someone else to whom I have spoken or whose report 
I have read (and who in turn may have had either direct or indirect knowledge of the statement). 
Similarly, unless otherwise indicated, information in this Affidavit resulting from surveillance 
does not necessarily set forth my personal observations, but may have been provided to me by 
other law enforcement agents who observed the events, and to whom I have spoken or whose 
report I have read. 
4. Target Cellphone, Subscriber, Target Subject, and Service Provider. The Target 
Cellphone referenced in this Affidavit is the cellphone assigned call number 
(the 
"Target Cellphone"). As further discussed below, the Target Cellphone is subscribed to in the 
name of "G Max" (the "Subscriber"). GHISLAINE MAXWELL is believed to use the Target 
2019.07.24 
EFTA00020380
--- PAGE 10 ---
Cellphone and is a Target Subject of this investigation. AT&T is the Service Provider for the 
Target Cellphone. 
5. Precision Location Capability. 
Cellphone service providers have technical 
capabilities that allow them to collect at least two kinds of information about the locations of the 
cellphones to which they provide service: (a) precision location information, also known as E-911 
Phase II data, GPS data, or latitude-longitude data, and (b) cell site data, also known as 
"tower/face" or "tower/sector" information. Precision location information provides relatively 
precise location information about a cellphone, which a provider can typically collect either via 
GPS tracking technology built into the phone or by triangulating the device's signal as received 
by the provider's nearby cell towers. Cell site data, by contrast, reflects only the cell tower and 
sector thereof utilized in routing any communication to and from the cellphone, as well as the 
approximate range of the cellphone from the tower during the communication (sometimes referred 
to as "per-call measurement" ("PCM") or "round-trip time" ("RTT") data). Because cell towers 
are often a half-mile or more apart, even in urban areas, and can be ten or more miles apart in rural 
areas, cell site data is typically less precise than precision location information. Based on my 
training and experience, I know that the Service Provider has the technical ability to collect 
precision location information from any cellphone on its network, including by initiating a signal 
on the Service Provider's network to determine the phone's location. I further know that cell site 
data is routinely collected by the Service Provider in the course of routing calls placed to or from 
any cellphone on their network.' 
' Toll records are sometimes necessary or helpful in order to obtain or interpret historical cell site 
data and are therefore also requested herein. 
2019.07.24 
EFTA00020381
--- PAGE 11 ---
6. Successor Service Provider. Because it is possible that the Target Subject may change 
cellphone service provider during the course of this investigation, it is requested that the warrant 
and investigative order requested apply without need for further order to any Successor Service 
Provider who may provide service to the Target Cellphone during the time frames at issue herein. 
II. Corrected Facts Establishing Probable Cause 
7. Although I understand that probable cause is not necessary to obtain all of the 
Requested Information, I respectfully submit that probable cause exists to believe that the 
Requested Information will lead to the location of a person, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, to be 
arrested for the crimes of conspiracy to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in 
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; enticement of a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in 
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2422; conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in criminal 
sexual activity, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; transporting a minor with intent to engage in 
criminal sexual activity, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a); and perjury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 
§ 1623 (the "Subject Offenses"). 
8. On June 29, 2020, a grand jury in the Southern District of New York returned an 
indictment charging GHISLAINE MAXWELL with the Subject Offenses. The Indictment 
charging MAXWELL is attached as Exhibit A hereto (the "Indictment"). That same day, United 
States Magistrate Judge Lisa Margaret Smith signed a warrant for MAXWELL's arrest, which is 
attached as Exhibit B hereto (the "Arrest Warrant"). 
9. In light of these pending charges in the Indictment and the issuance of the Arrest 
Warrant, GHISLAINE MAXWELL is subject to arrest for the Subject Offenses. 
10. Also on or about June 29, 2020, the Government submitted an Application and 
accompanying Agent Affidavit seeking a Warrant and Order permitting the FBI to obtain, among 
2019.07.24 
EFTA00020382
--- PAGE 12 ---
other things, Cellphone Location Information and Pen Register Information for the Target 
Cellphone.' Those documents were filed under the docket number 20 Mag. 6770. The original 
Application and Agent Affidavit are attached as Exhibit C hereto. That same day, United States 
Magistrate Judge Katharine H. Parker signed the requested Warrant and Order for the Target 
Cellphone, also filed under docket number 20 Mag. 6770. The original Warrant and Order for the 
Target Cellphone is attached as Exhibit D hereto. Pursuant to the Warrant and Order contained in 
Exhibit D, the FBI subsequently obtained historical cell site and GPS location data for the Target 
Cellphone. The collection of prospective location data pursuant to that Warrant and Order began 
on or about June 30, 2020 and remains ongoing. 
11. On the afternoon of June 30, 2020, and in the process of re-reviewing certain relevant 
phone data in connection with another potential application, I realized that my June 29, 2020 Agent 
Affidavit contained two inadvertent errors. First, the Agent Affidavit incorrectly stated that the 
Target Cellphone had been in contact with a phone identified as the Isabel Maxwell Phone within 
the last 30 days. In fact, the Target Cellphone was most recently in contact with the Isabel Maxwell 
Phone in or about May 2020, or within the last 60 days, not the last 30 days. Second, the Agent 
Affidavit incorrectly stated that the Target Cellphone had been in contact with a phone identified 
as the Scott Borgerson Phone within the last 30 days. In fact, the Target Cellphone was most 
recently in contact with the Scott Borgerson Phone in or about March 2020. The errors resulted 
from my misreading of certain phone records for the Target Cellphone. In particular, while one 
' The original application also sought authorization for Cellphone Location and Pen Register 
information for a second Target Cellphone, 
, which was identified as Target 
Cellphone-1 in that application and which was also granted on or about June 29, 2020. Because 
there were no errors in my affidavit with respect to Target Cellphone-1, this Amended Affidavit 
does not seek a Second Warrant and Order with respect to that phone. 
2019.07.24 
EFTA00020383
--- PAGE 13 ---
column in those records indicated that the Isabel Maxwell Phone and Scott Borgerson Phone had 
themselves been active within the last 30 days, I mistook those dates to be the dates of those 
phones' most recent contact with the Target Cellphone. I submit this Amended Agent Affidavit 
now to inform the Court of the error, to set forth a corrected statement of the facts supporting 
probable cause, and to seek a Second Warrant and Order authorizing the FBI to continue receiving 
prospective location data for the Target Cellphone. 
12. As detailed in my original affidavit, and based on my review of AT&T records, I have 
learned that the Target Cellphone is subscribed in the name of "G Max," which appears to be a 
shortened version of GHISLAINE MAXWELL's name. I further know from my review of AT&T 
records the following: 
a. The Target Cellphone has been active within the last 30 days. 
b. The Target Cellphone has been in contact with a phone subscribed to the 
business "Haddon, Morgan, & Foreman," which I know from my review of court records is the 
name of a law firm that currently represents GHISLAINE MAXWELL in civil litigation (the 
"Haddon, Morgan, & Foreman Phone"). The most recent contact between The Target Cellphone 
and the Haddon, Morgan, & Foreman Phone occurred within the last 30 days. 
c. The Target Cellular Device has also been in contact with a phone subscribed to 
in the name of "Laura Menninger," which I know from my review of court records is the name of 
an attorney who currently represents GHISLAINE MAXWELL in civil litigation (the "Laura 
Menninger Phone"). The most recent contact between The Target Cellular Device and the Laura 
Menninger Phone occurred within the last 30 days. 
d. The Target Cellular Device has also been in contact with a phone subscribed to 
in the name of "Isabel Maxwell," which I know from my review of a law enforcement database is 
2019.07.24 
EFTA00020384
--- PAGE 14 ---
the name of GHISLAINE MAXWELL's sister (the "Isabel Maxwell Phone"). The most recent 
contact between The Target Cellular Device and the Isabel Maxwell Phone occurred in or about 
May 2020. 
e. The Target Cellular Device has also been in contact with a phone subscribed to 
in the name of "Scott Borgerson," which I know from my review of bank records and Amazon 
records is the name of an individual with whom GHISLAINE MAXWELL shares a joint bank 
account and to whom MAXWELL's Amazon account has sent multiple packages within 
approximately the last year (the "Scott Borgerson Phone"). The most recent contact between The 
Target Cellular Device and the Scott Borgerson Phone occurred in or about March 2020. 
13. Accordingly, I respectfully submit that there is probable cause to believe that the 
location of the Target Cellphone will reveal the location of GHISLAINE MAXWELL. 
III. Request for Second Warrant and Order 
14. Based on the foregoing, I respectfully request that the Court require the Service 
Provider to provide the Requested Information as specified further in the Second Warrant and 
Order proposed herewith, including prospective precision location and cell site data for a period 
of 45 days from the date of this Order, historical cell site data and toll records for the period from 
June 1, 2020 through the date of this Order, and pen register information for a period of 45 days 
from the date of this Order. 
1. 
Nondisclosure. The scope of this ongoing criminal investigation and existence of 
the Indictment and Arrest Warrant are not publicly known. As a result, premature public disclosure 
of this affidavit or the requested Second Warrant and Order could alert GHISLAINE MAXWELL 
that she is under investigation and subject to arrest, causing her to destroy evidence, flee from 
prosecution, or otherwise seriously jeopardize the investigation. Specifically: 
2019.07.24 
EFTA00020385
--- PAGE 15 ---
a. As evidenced by the charges alleged in the Indictment, MAXWELL is known 
to have participated in acts of sexual abuse of minors. Alerting her to the existence and scope of 
the investigation may lead her to intimidate witnesses. See 18 U.S.C. § 2705(b)(1),(4). 
b. Additionally, the Target Subject is at liberty in the community. Premature 
disclosure of the existence of this application and the charges contained in the Indictment could 
result in the Target Subject fleeing from prosecution i f she were made aware of the pending charges 
before arrest. See 18 U.S.C. § 2705(b)(2). 
15. Accordingly, there is reason to believe that, were the Service Provider to notify the 
subscriber or others of the existence of the warrant, the investigation would be seriously 
jeopardized. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2705(b), I therefore respectfully request that the Service 
Provider be directed not to notify the Subscriber or others of the existence of the Second Warrant 
and Order for a period of one year, and that the Second Warrant and Order and all supporting 
papers be maintained under seal until the Court orders otherwise, as specified in the Amended 
Application submitted in conjunction with this Amended Affidavit.

WARRANT AND ORDER 
21) Mag. _6_O28 
Second Warrant and Order 
for Cellphone Location Information and Pen Register Information 
and for Sealing and Non-Disclosure 
TO: 
AT&T ("Service Provider), and any subsequent provider of service to the Target 
Cellphone specified below ("Subsequent Service Provide?) 
Federal Bureau of Investigation ("Investigative Agency") 
Upon the Application and Agent Affidavit submitted by the Government in this matter: 
I. Findings 
The Court hereby finds: 
1. The Target Cellphone (the "Target Cellphone") that is the subject of this Order is 
assigned call number 
is subscribed to in the name of "G Max" (the "Subscriber"), 
and is currently serviced by the Service Provider. 
2. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2703(c)(1)(A) and the applicable provisions of Rule 41 of the 
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Government's application sets forth probable cause to 
believe that the prospective and historical location information for the Target Cellphone will reveal 
the location of a person to be arrested for suspected violations of 18 U.S.C. §§ 371, 2422, 2423(a), 
and 1623 ("the Subject Offenses"). 
3. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2703(d), the Government's application also sets forth specific 
and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the toll records for 
the Target Cellphone are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation. 
2019.07.24 
EFTA00020387
--- PAGE 17 ---
4. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3123(b)(1), the Government has certified that the pen register 
information for the Target Cellphone is relevant to an ongoing investigation by the Investigating 
Agency of GHISLAINE MAXWELL and others unknown in connection with suspected violations

ORDER 
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge: 
As discussed in its previous order, the Court will hold an arraignment, initial conference, 
and bail hearing in this matter remotely as a video/teleconference on July 14, 2020 at 1 pm. 
Members of the press and the public in the United States may access the live audio feed of the 
proceeding by calling 855-268-7844 and using access code 32091812# and PIN 9921299#. 
Those outside of the United States may access the live audio feed by calling 214-416-0400 and 
using the same access code and PIN. These phone lines can accommodate approximately 500 
callers on a first come, first serve basis. 
The Court will provide counsel for both sides an additional dial-in number to be used to 
ensure audio access to the proceeding for non-speaking co-counsel, alleged victims, and any 
family members of the Defendant. The United States Attorney's Office should email Chambers 
with information regarding any alleged victims who are entitled, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 
§ 3771(a)(4), to be heard at the bail hearing and who wish to be heard. The Court will then 
provide information as to the logistics for their dial-in access. 
As the Court described in a previous order, members of the press and public may watch 
and listen to the live video feed in the Jury Assembly Room, at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan 
Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street. See Dkt. No. 10. However, in light of COVID-19, seating will be

limited to approximately 60 seats in order to enable appropriate social distancing and ensure 
public safety. Counsel for the Defendant and the Government may contact Chambers by email if 
there is a request to accommodate alleged victims or family members of the Defendant. 
Members of the credentialed in-house press corps may contact the District Executive's Office 
about seating. Otherwise, all seating will be allocated on a first come, first serve basis and in 
accordance with the S.D.N.Y. COVID-19 Courthouse Entry Program and this Court's previous 
order of July 7, 2020. See Dkt. No. 10. If conditions change or the Court otherwise concludes 
that allowing for in-person viewing of the video feed at the courthouse is not consistent with 
public health, the Court may provide audio access by telephone only. 
Any photographing, recording, or rebroadcasting of federal court proceedings is 
prohibited by law. Violation of these prohibitions may result in fines or sanctions, including 
removal of court issued media credentials, restricted entry to future hearings, denial of entry to 
future hearings, or any other sanctions deemed necessary by the Court.

Subject: RE: piling on 
I haven't been able to find anything in which Maxwell's attorneys claim they don't know where Maxwell is. That 
statement was only reported on (as best I can tell) in this article 
(https://creativedestructionmed ia.cominews/politics/2020/01/23/ghisla i ne-maxwell s-lawyers-adm it-they-dont-know-
where-she-is-either/), which refers to a letter filed with Judge Preska in January 2020, and dated December 2019. The 
article claims that the letter admitted Maxwell's lawyers don't know where their client is. Maxwell's attorneys filed one 
letter from that time period to Judge Preska that I've found. That letter does not include any suggestion that Maxwell's 
counsel does not know where Maxwell is. Rather, the letter cites to newspaper articles about the frenzied attempts of 
reporters to track Maxwell down. So seems that the article misrepresented the letter from Maxwell's attorneys. 
In case it's helpful, though, I found a couple orders permitting alternative service because of plaintiffs' inability to serve 
Maxwell. 
Here is a text order in 
case approving alternative service after Maxwell's counsel refused to accept service. 
06/15/2020 
ORDER granting 43 Motion To Approve Alternate Service on Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell 
("Maxwell"). Plaintiffs motion is unopposed, and, based on Plaintiffs representations regarding 
her unsuccessful efforts to locate Maxwell's current residence, her fruitless attempts to serve 
Maxwell at multiple locations, her equally fruitless attempts to contact Maxwell via several 
email addresses publicly associated with Maxwell, and her rejected request to Maxwell's 
known litigation counsel to accept service on Maxwell's behalf, this Court finds that Plaintiff has 
adequately demonstrated that she has made diligent efforts to effect service, and that personal 
service would be impracticable. See Ransome v. Epstein, No. 17cv616 (JGK), 2018 WL 637421, 
at *1 (S.D.NY. Jan. 30, 2018); see also Farmer v. lndyke, No. 19cv10475 (LGS)(DF) (Text Order, 
dated Feb. 12, 2020). This Court further finds that Plaintiff's provision of a copy of the 
Summons and Complaint by email to Maxwell's current counsel of record in the Farmer case 
(see Declaration of Robert S. Glassman, dated May 27, 2020 (Dkt. 43-2), Ex. 3) was reasonably 
calculated to place Maxwell on notice of this suit and to constitute sufficient service under the 
circumstances presented here. No later than 6/18/20, Plaintiff is directed to serve Maxwell with 
a copy of this Text Order by the same means (i.e., by email to Maxwell's counsel of record in the 
Farmer case), and to file proof of such service on the Docket of this action. Maxwell may then 
have until 7/9/20 to move, answer, or otherwise respond to the Complaint. (HEREBY ORDERED 
by Magistrate Judge Debra Freeman)(Text Only Order) (Freeman, Debra) (Entered: 06/15/2020) 
And here is a similar text order granting the same request a 
case after Maxwell's counsel refused to accept 
service.

ORIGINAL 
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
x 
• 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
• 
• 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 
Defendant. 
COUNT ONE 
SUPERSEDING INDICTMENT 
S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
(Conspiracy to Entice Minors to Travel to Engage in 
Illegal Sex Acts) 
The Grand Jury charges: 
OVERVIEW 
1. 
The charges set forth herein stem from the role 
of GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, in the sexual exploitation 
and abuse of multiple minor girls by Jeffrey Epstein. In 
particular, from at least in or about 1994, up to and including 
at least in or about 2004, MAXWELL assisted, facilitated, and 
contributed to Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minor girls by, among 
other things, helping Epstein to recruit, groom, and ultimately 
abuse victims known to MAXWELL and Epstein to be under the age 
of 18. The victims were as young as 14 years old when they were 
groomed and abused by MAXWELL and Epstein, both of whom knew 
that certain victims were in fact under the age of 18. 
2. 
As a part and in furtherance of their scheme to 
abuse minor victims, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, and 
Jeffrey Epstein enticed and caused minor victims to travel to 
EFTA00020401
--- PAGE 2 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 187 Filed 03/29/21 Page 2 of 24 
Epstein's residences in different states, which MAXWELL knew and 
intended would result in their grooming for and subjection to 
sexual abuse. Moreover, in an effort to conceal her crimes, 
MAXWELL repeatedly lied when questioned about her conduct, 
including in relation to some of the minor victims described 
herein, when providing testimony under oath in 2016. 
FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
3. 
During the time periods charged in this 
Indictment, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, had a personal and 
professional relationship with Jeffrey Epstein and was among his 
closest associates. In particular, between in or about 1994 and 
in or about 1997, MAXWELL was in an intimate relationship with 
Epstein. Additionally, between in or about 1994 and in or about 
2004, MAXWELL was paid by Epstein to manage his various 
properties. 
4. 
Beginning in at least 1994, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, 
the defendant, enticed and groomed multiple minor girls to 
engage in sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein, through a variety of 
means and methods, including but not limited to the following: 
a. 
MAXWELL first attempted to befriend some of 
Epstein's minor victims prior to their abuse, including by 
asking the victims about their lives, their schools, and their 
families. MAXWELL and Epstein would spend time building 
friendships with minor victims by, for example, taking minor 
EFTA00020402
--- PAGE 3 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 187 Filed 03/29/21 Page 3 of 24 
victims to the movies or shopping. Some of these outings would 
involve MAXWELL and Epstein spending time together with a minor 
victim, while some would involve MAXWELL or Epstein spending 
time alone with a minor victim. 
b. 
Having developed a rapport with a victim, 
MAXWELL would try to normalize sexual abuse for a minor victim 
by, among other things, discussing sexual topics, undressing in 
front of the victim, being present when a minor victim was 
undressed, and/or being present for sex acts involving the minor 
victim and Epstein. 
c. 
MAXWELL'S presence during minor victims' 
interactions with Epstein, including interactions where the 
minor victim was undressed or that involved sex acts with 
Epstein, helped put the victims at ease because an adult woman 
was present. For example, in some instances, MAXWELL would 
massage Epstein in front of a minor victim. In other instances, 
MAXWELL encouraged minor victims to provide massages to Epstein, 
including sexualized massages during which a minor victim would 
be fully or partially nude. Many of those massages resulted in 
Epstein sexually abusing the minor victims. 
d. 
In addition, Epstein offered to help some 
minor victims by paying for travel and/or educational 
opportunities, and MAXWELL encouraged certain victims to accept 
Epstein's assistance. As a result, victims were made to feel 
EFTA00020403
--- PAGE 4 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 187 Filed 03/29/21 Page 4 of 24 
indebted and believed that MAXWELL and Epstein were trying to 
help them. 
e. 
Through this process, MAXWELL and Epstein 
enticed victims to engage in sexual activity with Epstein. In 
some instances, MAXWELL was present for and participated in the 
sexual abuse of minor victims. Some such incidents occurred in 
the context of massages, which developed into sexual encounters. 
5. 
Between approximately in or about 1994 and in or 
about 2004, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, facilitated 
Jeffrey Epstein's access to minor victims by, among other 
things, inducing and enticing, and aiding and abetting the 
inducement and enticement of, multiple minor victims. Victims 
were groomed and/or abused at multiple locations, including the 
following: 
a. 
A multi-story private residence on the Upper 
East Side of Manhattan, New York owned by Epstein (the "New York 
Residence"). 
b. 
An estate in Palm Beach, Florida owned by 
Epstein (the "Palm Beach Residence"). 
c. 
A ranch in Santa Fe, New Mexico owned by 
Epstein (the "New Mexico Residence"). 
d. 
MAXWELL's personal residence in London, 
England. 
EFTA00020404
--- PAGE 5 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 187 Filed 03/29/21 Page 5 of 24 
6. 
Additionally, beginning at least in or about 
2001, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, and Jeffrey Epstein 
enticed and recruited, and caused to be enticed and recruited, 
minor girls to visit Epstein's Palm Beach Residence to engage in 
sex acts with Epstein, after which Epstein, MAXWELL, or another 
employee of Epstein's would give the victims hundreds of dollars 
in cash. Epstein and MAXWELL encouraged one or more of those 
victims to travel with Epstein with the intention that the 
victim engage in sex acts with Epstein. Moreover, and in order 
to maintain and increase his supply of victims, Epstein, 
MAXWELL, and other Epstein employees also paid certain victims 
to recruit additional girls to be similarly abused by Epstein. 
In this way, Epstein and MAXWELL created a network of underage 
victims for him to sexually exploit. 
7. 
Between at least in or about 2001 and in or about 
2004, GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, and Epstein encouraged 
and enticed one or more minor victims to engage in paid sex acts 
with Epstein through a variety of means and methods, including 
but not limited to the following: 
a. 
Epstein's employees, including, at times, 
MAXWELL, would call a victim to schedule an appointment for the 
victim to massage Epstein at his Palm Beach Residence. MAXWELL 
placed at least some of those calls while with Epstein in 
EFTA00020405
--- PAGE 6 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 187 Filed 03/29/21 Page 6 of 24 
Manhattan, New York. Epstein would often travel from New York 
to Florida, where he would then have the scheduled appointments. 
b. 
When a victim initially arrived at the Palm 
Beach Residence, she would be greeted by an employee of 
Epstein's, including, at times, MAXWELL. The victim would then 
be escorted to a room with a massage table. Once inside, the 
victim would provide a nude or semi-nude massage for EPSTEIN, 
who would himself typically be naked. During these encounters, 
EPSTEIN would escalate the nature and scope of the physical 
contact to include sex acts such as groping and direct and 
indirect contact with the victim's genitals. EPSTEIN would also 
typically masturbate during these encounters, ask the victim to 
touch him while he masturbated, and touch the victim's genitals 
with his hands or with sex toys. 
c. 
In connection with each sexual encounter, 
Epstein or one of his employees or associates, including, at 
times, MAXWELL, paid the victim in cash. Each victim was 
typically paid hundreds of dollars for each encounter. 
8. 
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, facilitated 
Jeffrey Epstein's access to minor victims knowing that he had a 
sexual preference for underage girls and that he intended to 
engage in sexual activity with those victims. Epstein's 
resulting abuse of minor victims included, among other things, 
touching a victim's breast, touching a victim's genitals, 
EFTA00020406
--- PAGE 7 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 187 Filed 03/29/21 Page 7 of 24 
placing a sex toy such as a vibrator on a victim's genitals, 
directing a victim to touch Epstein while he masturbated, and 
directing a victim to touch Epstein's genitals. 
MAXWELL AND EPSTEIN'S VICTIMS 
9. 
Among the victims induced or enticed by GHISLAINE 
MAXWELL, the defendant, were minor victims identified herein as 
Minor Victim-1, Minor Victim-2, Minor Victim-3, and Minor 
Victim-4. In particular, and during time periods relevant to 
this Indictment, MAXWELL engaged in the following acts, among 
others, with respect to minor victims: 
a. 
MAXWELL met Minor Victim-1 when Minor 
Victim-1 was approximately 14 years old. MAXWELL subsequently 
interacted with Minor Victim-1 on multiple occasions at 
Epstein's residences, knowing that Minor Victim-1 was under the 
age of 18 at the time. During these interactions, which took 
place between approximately 1994 and 1997, MAXWELL groomed Minor 
Victim-1 to engage in sexual acts with Epstein through multiple 
means. First, MAXWELL and Epstein attempted to befriend Minor 
Victim-1, taking her to the movies and on shopping trips. 
MAXWELL also asked Minor Victim-1 about school, her classes, her 
family, and other aspects of her life. MAXWELL then sought to 
normalize inappropriate and abusive conduct by, among other 
things, undressing in front of Minor Victim-1 and being present 
when Minor Victim-1 undressed in front of Epstein. Within the 
EFTA00020407

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 187 Filed 03/29/21 Page 8 of 24 
first year after MAXWELL and Epstein met Minor Victim-1, Epstein 
began sexually abusing Minor Victim-1. MAXWELL was present for 
and involved in some of this abuse. In particular, MAXWELL 
involved Minor Victim-1 in group sexualized massages of Epstein. 
During those group sexualized massages, MAXWELL and/or Minor 
Victim-1 would engage in sex acts with Epstein. Epstein and 
MAXWELL both encouraged Minor Victim-1 to travel to Epstein's 
residences in both New York and Florida. As a result, Minor 
Victim-1 was sexually abused by Epstein in both New York and 
Florida. Minor Victim-1 was enticed to travel across state 
lines for the purpose of sexual encounters with Epstein, and 
MAXWELL was aware that Epstein engaged in sexual activity with 
Minor Victim-1 after Minor-Victim-1 traveled to Epstein's 
prcperties, including in the context of a sexualized massage. 
b. 
MAXWELL interacted with Minor Victim-2 on at 
least one occasion in or about 1996 at Epstein's residence in 
New Mexico when Minor Victim-2 was under the age of 18. Minor 
Victim-2 had flown into New Mexico from out of state at 
Epstein's invitation for the purpose of being groomed for and/or 
subjected to acts of sexual abuse. MAXWELL knew that Minor 
Victim-2 was under the age of 18 at the time. While in New 
Mexico, MAXWELL and Epstein took Minor Victim-2 to a movie and 
MAXWELL took Minor Victim-2 shopping. MAXWELL also discussed 
Minor Victim-2's school, classes, and family with Minor Victim-

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 187 Filed 03/29/21 Page 9 of 24 
2. In New Mexico, MAXWELL began her efforts to groom Minor 
Victim-2 for abuse by Epstein by, among other things, providing 
an unsolicited massage to Minor Victim-2, during which Minor 
Victim-2 was topless. MAXWELL also encouraged Minor Victim-2 to 
massage Epstein. 
c. 
MAXWELL groomed and befriended Minor 
Victim-3 in London, England between approximately 1994 and 1995, 
including during a period of time in which MAXWELL knew that 
Minor Victim-3 was under the age of 18. Among other things, 
MAXWELL discussed Minor Victim-3's life and family with Minor 
Victim-3. MAXWELL introduced Minor Victim-3 to Epstein and 
arranged for multiple interactions between Minor Victim-3 and 
Epstein. During those interactions, MAXWELL encouraged Minor 
Victim-3 to massage Epstein, knowing that Epstein would engage 
in sex acts with Minor Victim-3 during those massages. Minor 
Victim-3 provided Epstein with the requested massages, and 
during those massages, Epstein sexually abused Minor Victim-3. 
MAXWELL was aware that Epstein engaged in sexual activity with 
Minor Victim-3 on multiple occasions, including at times when 
Minor Victim-3 was under the age of 18, including in the context 
of a sexualized massage. 
d. 
Minor Victim-4 was recruited to provide 
Epstein with sexualized massages for which Minor Victim-4 was 
paid by Epstein and/or one of his associates, including, at

Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 187 Filed 03/29/21 Page 10 of 24 
times, MAXWELL, at the Palm Beach Residence beginning in or 
around 2001. MAXWELL met Minor Victim-4 at Epstein's Palm Beach 
Residence when Minor Victim-4 was approximately 14 years old. 
MAXWELL subsequently interacted with Minor Victim-4 on multiple 
occasions at Epstein's Palm Beach Residence, knowing that Minor 
Victim-4 was under the age of 18 at the time. During these 
interactions, which took place between approximately 2001 and 
2004, MAXWELL groomed Minor Victim-4 to engage in sexual acts 
with Epstein through multiple means. For example, MAXWELL asked 
Minor Victim-4 about her family and other aspects of her life. 
MAXWELL also sought to normalize inappropriate and abusive 
conduct by, among other things, discussing sexual topics in 
front of Minor Victim-4 and being present when Minor Victim-4 
was nude in the massage room of the Palm Beach Residence. On 
multiple occasions between approximately 2001 and 2004, Minor 
Victim-4 provided nude massages to Epstein at the Palm Beach 
Residence, during which Epstein engaged in multiple sex acts 
with Minor Victim-4. Epstein's employees, including at times 
MAXWELL, called Minor Victim-4, including from New York, to 
schedule appointments for Minor Victim-4 to massage Epstein. 
After each massage, Epstein or one of his employees, including 
at times MAXWELL, paid Minor Victim-4 hundreds of dollars in 
cash. At some point during this period, both Epstein and 
MAXWELL invited Minor Victim-4 to travel with Epstein and 
EFTA00020410
--- PAGE 11 ---
Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 187 Filed 03/29/21 Page 11 of 24 
offered to assist Minor Victim-4 with obtaining a passport for 
purposes of such travel, but Minor Victim-4 declined the 
invitation. On multiple occasions between approximately 2001 
and 2004, Epstein's employees, including at times MAXWELL, sent 
Minor Victim-4 gifts, including lingerie, from an address in 
Manhattan, New York to Minor Victim-4's residence in Florida. 
Epstein and MAXWELL each also encouraged Minor Victim-4 to 
recruit other young females to provide sexualized massages to 
Epstein. In response, Minor Victim-4 brought multiple females, 
including girls under the age of 18, to provide sexualized 
massages for Epstein at the Palm Beach Residence. On such 
occasions, both Minor Victim-4 and the girl she brought were 
paid hundreds of dollars in cash.

Following up on point number 7, that gap would not come in between those two productions but would instead be 
contained solely in the November 18, 2020 production. If you are missing those files, the omission was unintentional, and 
we have those files available to produce immediately. If you can send a link to your ftp site, our paralegal can upload 
those materials right away.

Chris, 
We are available for a call to discuss tomorrow between 1pm and 2pm, between 3pm and 5pm, or after 5:30pm. Please 
let us know if there is a time in those windows that would work on your end. In the meantime, below are some initial 
responses: 
1. Our supervisors have indicated that we are not permitted to send a drive that our IT department did not load to 
the MDC. As a result, we cannot provide the drive directly to the MDC. That said, I am happy to join you in asking 
the MDC to accept the drive from you. If the MDC still refuses, then my office would not object to an application to 
Judge Nathan for an order directing the MDC to accept the drive from you, though we would need to allow MDC 
legal counsel the opportunity to note their objections to Judge Nathan. 
2. The MDC recently alerted us to this issue, and our paralegal converted the excel files at issue to pdfs and sent a 
new CD with those pdfs to the MDC. If you client still cannot view them, then we are happy to load them to a drive 
if you would like to provide one for us. 
3. I have asked our vendor to look into this issue and will get back to you when I have spoken with them. 
4. I have asked our vendor to look into this issue and will get back to you when I have spoken with them. That said, 
similar to the note I sent in my email regarding highly confidential images on March 16, 2021, the electronic files 
recovered from Epstein's devices have the same metadata on the hard drive that was available when the FBI seized 
each file. For files that were carved or deleted, no metadata was recovered, so none is viewable, except for data 
showing when a particular file was saved to a drive by the investigative team or prepared for production. 
5. As indicated in our November 9, 2020 discovery letter, all images within Bates range SDNY_GM_00467566 though 
SDNY_GM_00514100 were seized during the 2019 searches of Epstein residences. These are the images from the 
CDs that were recovered during those searches, so they did not come from any of the electronic devices that were 
the subject of extractions by CART. As a result, these images would not have CART numbers. As for the metadata, I 
have asked our vendor to look into this issue and will get back to you when I have spoken with them. 
6. I have asked our vendor to look into this issue and will get back to you when I have spoken with them. That said, I 
note again that the electronic files recovered from Epstein's devices have the same metadata on the hard drive that 
was available when the FBI seized each file. For files that were carved or deleted, no metadata was recovered, so 
none is viewable. Additionally, as indicated in our November 9, 2020 discovery letter, all images within the 
SDNY011 load file (Bates range SDNY_GM_00467566 though SDNY_GM_00514100) were seized during the 2019 
searches of Epstein residences. These are the images from the CDs that were recovered during those searches, so 
they did not come from any of the electronic devices that were the subject of extractions by CART. As a result,

We write to raise a few issues concerning the discovery. Below is the list of items. Please let me know if you are free for a 
call to discuss. 
1. On our last call, we asked you if we could send our client a hard drive containing the discovery that we had created 
(without the highly confidential items). You had said you would check to see if you could facilitate this. We have 
not heard back from you. Are you able to send Ms. Maxwell the hard drive? 
2. The last two productions you sent to Ms. Maxwell on disks. As you know, she cannot read disks on her laptop and 
must use the prison computer. But the prison computer cannot read some of the files. We can include these files 
on our hard drive to send to Ms. Maxwell. Otherwise, you will need to produce them on a hard drive. Please 
advise which way you would like to proceed. 
3. A number of the emails in the discovery — over 109,000 — were produced without their attachments (see tab 1 of 
the attached Excel file). Instead, the attachments appear as slip-sheets (see example attached). Please provide the 
missing attachments, if they exist. 
4. A number of electronic documents — over 110,000 — that were extracted from one of Epstein's devices, as identified 
by a CART number, have metadata that indicates a "date created" or "date last modified" date in July 2020 or 
afterwards (see tab 2 of the attached Excel file). We request that you produce a metadata overlay with the original 
metadata for these files. 
5. A number of photographs — over 6500 — were produced in native format, but do not have a CART number and have 
"date created" and/or "date last modified" dates after July 2019 (see tab 3 of the attached Excel file). Please 
provide the CART number for these photographs or specify which device they came from. Also, we request that 
you produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files. 
EFTA00020428
--- PAGE 4 ---
6. A number of the audio/visual files — over 460 — have similar metadata issues (see tab 4 of the attached Excel file). 
These fall into the following buckets: 
a. SDNY GM SUPP: these have CART numbers, but were produced without metadata load files and have 
"date created" and "date last modified" dates in September-November 2020, after the date the device was 
seized. We request that you produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files. 
b. SDNY005 (October 20 2020 production): these are a few videos from the SDFL or PBPD investigations that 
were produced in native form without metadata load files. They have Sept-Oct 2020 dates. We request that 
you produce a metadata overlay with the original metadata for these files. 
c. SDNY011 (November 9 2020 production): these were produced in native form with load files, but do not 
reference a CART number and have Sept 2020 dates. We request that you provide a CART number for these 
files or indicate their source. Also, we request that you produce a metadata overlay with the original 
metadata for these files. 
7. There is a gap between 11/18 and 12/18 production numbers (SDNY_GM_02742044 to 2742183). Was that 
intentional or are we missing those documents? 
Please let us know your responses as soon as possible.

Good afternoon counsel: 
I have been engaged to represent Ghislaine Maxwell in her appeal from the denial of her third application for

18, 22, 97, 100, 103, 106, 159, 160, 165, 171, 169. Do you have any objection to me having access to these

Thanks for letting us know that you'll be counsel on this appeal. As an initial matter, the majority of the docket 
entries you've referenced do not appear to be redacted. In any event, you may obtain these materials from 
defense counsel -- I've copied them here. This case is already governed by a protective order (ECF No. 36),

This email concerns the investigation into the death of Jeffrey Epstein in 
the MCC. We realize that it is unlikely your office is involved, but we 
thought that we should inform the government of the following so you can 
take whatever action you believe is appropriate. 
Jhonny Contreras was recently returned to the SHU in the MCC. At the 
time of Mr. Epstein's death, it is my understanding that Mr. Contreras was 
housed in a cell on the same tier and across the hall from Mr. Epstein's 
cell. Mr. Contreras did not see Mr. Epstein hang himself, but he would be 
willing to speak to investigators, in the presence of counsel, about his 
observations.

Threat To Life: False 
Submitted Text: 
When I was 6-8 years old and living at 
in Surrey, UK, I was drugged at night and driven 
by my father, 
to pedophile ring "parties". The main house I was taken to is located behind 
Thorpe Green, at the end of a private road. Hurst Farm Livery Stables is next door. In the driveway of this 
house, I was hit by a dark blue car with a personalised license plate ending in "M", driven by Prince 
Andrew. I was not taken to hospital, but I suffered permanent injuries to my ribs, hip and leg on my right 
side. The car's hood figurine broke off in my hand on impact and I later buried it near my home, so it could 
still be recoverable as evidence. After I was hit by the car, I woke up to Prince Andrew 
In that house, I was also 
I have medical records of the resulting infection. I once ran away 
from the house naked, and made it to the Irish Traveller community down the road (GPS: 51.405369, -
0.546576). I remember seeing and speaking to a man, so I think that there may be Irish Travellers living in 
the area who could corroborate what goes on there.  
 I was also taken to another house that I later 
recognised as Frogmore Cottage when its refurbishment was in the news in 2018. There, I was restrained on 
a table and tortured with electrical shocks by Ghislaine Maxwell and surrounded by watching men. I 
remember seeing Prince Andrew's face. 
I tried to sneak out. 
Maxwell caught me and beat me with the bristle end of a broom. 
. She also threatened me, saying that I "deserved to die" and hit me in the face with the broom, 
breaking my nose. I was only taken to the hospital for the broken nose after a rugby match, so that the 
injury could be blamed on that.

Subject Information 
First Name: Ghislaine 
Middle Name: 
Last Name: Maxwell 
Age: 58 
DOB: 
Additional Info: During this time frame, I also went on yearly vacations with my family to Florida, staying at 
my grandparent's house in Vero Beach. I remember on one occasion being driven by my father over an hour 
away to a mansion with a gated driveway and a large rectangular swimming pool. I was molested by a man 
that I later recognised as Epstein when he was in the news. He 
). He took pornographic p otograp s o me in a s Girt. 
Around late 2012, I had not yet fully processed all these memories, but I reported my father to the police 
after seeing a text from G. Maxwell on his phone saying: "I have two children", and being triggered by it. I 
believe it's possible that my father may have been involved in procurement for the pedophile ring even 
then, because he made visits to several local schools and a disabled children's home (the White Lodge 
Centre). In the end, he was not arrested and the case was not investigated. As a result, he was able to 
destroy a lot of evidence, such as photographs. Releasing Ghislaine Maxwell on bail would lead to the same 
outcome. 
I am willing to testify, and provide evidence and/or more detailed descriptions of events.

friends with the princess of Yugoslavia and the lingerie model actress 
serbian-Canadian

disappeared while Matthew helped the Israeli moving company Northstar 
/Moishe's move me into my very first apartment in July 1997 when I was 20 
years old in Los Angeles. In retrospect there was a clear plot taking 
place, and I was introduced to Epstein early on at a bar next to were 
Matthew Settle Lived. I heard 
call him on the phone and ask on 
speaker phone sometime between April- June of 1997 if Matthew had her 
money yet. He said to me she would send the Serbian mafia to hurt him if 
he didn't come up with the money. He did not mention that my artwork was 
where the money was going to come from. The friend of mine who told her 
serbian friends about my artwork which started chain of events 
culminating in the disappearance of all of my artwork is named Jasmine 
Dashtizad. 
One of my stolen paintings is of Bill Clinton's head on a 
woman (Hillary Clinton's) body. I painted it between November 1995 to 
January 1996. I was a teenager. I drew my own dental impressions in the 
Ray Johnson estate collage, I also drew one of my fingerprints. And 
that art is made out of pieces of my high school calendar which fell 
apart from overuse, so I glued the pieces onto thick cardstock and drew 
designs and draeings around the glued pieces. I also traced my own 
handprints on that art. I also drew a replica of the art on the cover of 
my 12th grade high school play production program and I also wrote the 
fictional bio of Ray Johnson.

Additional Info: Ray johnson estate - online website - the artwork is

to a deceased person in the art gallery world named David Bourdain or 
Bourdan for the year 1998. It was stolen from me in July 1997. 
Petrina Ryan Kleid has an online presence and has many fake articles 
written about my artwork falsely attributed to herself. 
One of those paintinhs was originally a painting of Dan Quayle, but 
someone has painted over the face to make it look like George Bush Jr. 
Instead. That painting used to depict a note tacked on to the wall that 
spelled potato wrong (potatoe) which was crossed out and underneath was 
written the correct spelling of potatoes. Also, my signature used to be

on the front of the desk but it has been painted over. I usually used 
permanent marking pen ink for my signature, so it probably can be 
detected using the appropriate technologies for analyzing art. This 
applies to all of my stolen paintings. But my drawings were often signed 
in pencil but I drew my fingerprint, my dental impressions and my traced 
handprints on the Ray Johnson estate art that is listed in the 
Smithsonian. There is a lot more information about fraud and forgery 
going on with Sotheby's London 2017 and db henkel in traverse city. It 
would like to share all information in depth, so that all of these fake 
/forged worthless paintings that were stolen from me can be removed 
permanently from the big money art market and hopefully returned to me 
because they belong to me, they are sentimental personal property and I 
will never get over this until these people are stopped from their art 
fraud. Another gake artist has a serbian name Biljana Djurdjevic and 
Tony Podesta bought all of those stolen paintings of mine, including one 
that is a self portrait of myself at 19 years old. 
How is Contact Known: this is the person who owed the Serbian- Canadian 
model 
money who was connected to Mark Epstein, Jeffrey 
Epstein, Jean Luc Brunel, Ghislaine Maxwell, Elle McPherson and her 
manager Stuart, the professional magician J.B. Benn

Hi, my name is 
I think I may have been a victim by jeffrey epstein. I was about 15 at 
the time. My friend said we could make some quick money just by giving a 
massage. So we met with her friend who his name was Andy. When we went I 
sat down while she went inside the bedroom. She came out & Andy said he 
wanted me to come in. When I walked in there was another man sitting on 
I don't know who I need to talk to about this but

the bed which made me even made hesitate to go in but I went in. I gave a 
quick massage to a man who looks very much like him. Then he proceeded to 
take my clothes off without my permission. All I remember is getting 
touched, touching a man,& then having a 
on me. After it was all 
done he gave us money & we left. I'm really trying to remember if it was 
him or not since I've blocked absolutely so much of those years out of my 
head. But he looks so familiar & that voice of his as well.Not only that 
but months later Andy drives by the place I stayed at & asked me was 
there anyone in the government or law enforcement looking for him. He 
said that he was part of a thing with a powerful man & he has to get out 
of town if they were looking for him. I told him they weren't which it 
was the case. I know Andy & other men he knew would give girls but mostly 
Russian girls places to stay & help them with work. Much of that work was 
prostitution for rich men that Andy pimped them out to. So I am hoping 
you can help me figure out if I was Epstein victims by answering some 
questions so I can piece it together. Such as could you please tell me if 
you have proof that jeffrey epstein was in Virginia Beach,Virginia in the 
2000's? Did Epstein have Russian girls in Virginia Beach, Virginia? Do 
you have a Virginia Beach home address on file for him that I could 
verify back to you? Finally has the name Andy ever come up in ur files 
that's related to Epstein in anyway? If you would be so kind to email me 
back it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

Maitland, FL 32751, called the FBI 
National Threat Operations Center (NTOC) to report being approached as a minor by Ghislaine Maxwell. 
provided the following information: 
Approximately 28 years ago, when 
was 14 years old, Maxwell approached her about modeling, 
international travel, and massages. 
worked at the Jupiter Gym, which is now known as Elite Gym of 
Palm Beach, FL, and was working out on an elliptical machine when Maxwell saw her through a window. 
Maxwell spoke to the person at the gym's front desk before walking up to the Caller. Maxwell provided a 
card to M
e and asked if she was a model. 
said she was 14 when Maxwell asked about her age. 
As a child, 
modeled and was involved in pageants, but was told by a modeling agency she was unable 
to be a runway model due to a hip defect. When Maxwell offered to help 
become involved in 
modeling, including international opportunities, 
tuned out most of what Maxwell said. 
remembered Maxwell mentioned Victoria Secret and massages. 
never reached out to Maxwell because the offer sounded as if it was mostly based around modeling, 
which 
was unable to do.

Please note that the item identified with bates number SDNY_ GM_ 02742043 consists of 
the final portion of images identified responsive from Subject Device-2, which is an iPhone that 
law enforcement seized from Jeffrey Epstein at the time of his arrest in 2019. The remainder of 
the responsive materials from that same device were previously produced to you on November 9, 
2020. Due to technical difficulties, we were unable to complete the responsiveness review of 
images from this device until November 17, 2020. 
Additionally, as a courtesy, attached to this letter please find a chart of the Subject Devices 
searched pursuant to warrants in this case. The chart includes the FBI identifiers associated with 
each device and the date(s) on which the Government produced responsive material from each 
device to the defense. As noted in the chart, in some instances, the Government determined that 
there was no responsive material from certain devices and accordingly did not produce any data 
from those particular devices.

Subject: DAILY BEAST: Manhattan D.A. Cy Vance Finally Got Harvey Weinstein, but He's Still Letting 
Women Down 
Date: Fri, 06 Mar 2020 15:28:01 +0000 
Manhattan D.A. Cy 
Vance Finally Got 
Harvey Weinstein, but 
He's Still Letting Women 
Down 
The prosecutor who says in 2020 that "rape is rape and sexual assault is sexual assault," 
signed a memo on behalf of NY's DAs in 2013 opposing a bill that would've made that so. 
ALEXIS GRENELL 
Updated Mar. 06, 2020 7:00AM ET / Published Mar. 05, 2020 4:54AM ET 
Marissa Hoechstetter was sitting at her desk on the morning of June 28, 2018, when a blind number 
appeared on her cell phone. She picked up and her stomach dropped: "This is Cyrus Vance calling from 
Manhattan." 
A week earlier, after repeatedly requesting to speak to the Manhattan District Attorney, Hoechstetter 
had had a one-hour conversation with one of his top deputies regarding the obstetrician who'd licked 
her vagina and sexually assaulted at least 18 other patients. The conversation was about the settlement 
the DA's office reached with Dr. Robert Hadden in 2016 to surrender his medical license and plead 
EFTA00020535
--- PAGE 2 ---
guilty to a single felony count of third-degree criminal sexual act and misdemeanor forcible touching in 
exchange for prosecutors agreeing not to prosecute the other crimes they were aware of, or pursue 
prison time, even though they had grand jury testimony from victims—including Evelyn Yang—eager 
to go to trial. The assistant DA who'd called Hoechstetter—the same one who Vance later said "made a 
mistake" in asking to downgrade Jeffrey Epstein's sex offender status in 2011, which a judge denied—
successfully negotiated for Hadden to receive a lesser sex offender status than guidelines indicated, 
keeping his name out of a publicly accessible database. 
Unsatisfied with both the outcome and the deputy, Hoechstetter continued to send emails requesting 
to speak to the man himself. When he finally called, she cut right to the chase: "My biggest issue, and 
the thing that I believe matters the most is the discretion that you have." Noting that the public might 
not be aware of how many cases get resolved via plea deal as opposed to at trial, she added, "I think 
there are people who are negotiated with more frequently." 
That's the central issue for #MeToo: Whose humanity counts more? Quid pro quo corruption 
sometimes tilts the scales of justice, but perhaps more salient is the institutional sexism that weighs a 
man's right to reputational preservation as a factor in determining justice. 
When it comes to that, Vance has at times seemed eager to lose, preemptively surrendering his power 
in anticipation of even the most ridiculous defense. A senior prosecutor recently told the New York 
Times that the Hadden case was "not a slam dunk" because his defense would have exploited the 
"serious proof issues" given that pregnant women don't have a clear view of their own genitals. That's 
like saying that if a proctologist touches a man with his tongue the patient is an unreliable witness 
because he can't see his own rectum. 
Hoechstetter shared with me the transcript of her conversation with Vance, which she received in 
response to a freedom of information request to his office. The clear motivation for his call, years after 
Hadden's case had been settled, was a BuzzFeed story featuring Hoechstetter and drawing national 
attention to the case. Over the course of 4o minutes, Vance was respectful but also tone-deaf, 
acknowledging how "upsetting" Hoechstetter's assault must have been, as if the miscarriage of justice 
is a matter of hurt feelings. Throughout, Hoechstetter was direct and collaborative, while holding 
Vance to account for the decision-making in her case. He lamely offered to send someone to speak 
about sex crimes at the women's college where she works. 
A deputy later described Hoechstetter as "crying toward the end." 
Except she didn't. 
EFTA00020536
--- PAGE 3 ---
"I was so proud of myself for not crying," Hoeshstetter told me. "So then when I got the documents and 
I saw how they were talking about me, 'who's going to call her back, make her feel heard' or whatever, 
and then this note that she was crying at the end really upset me. And I do cry, believe me, but I wasn't 
crying then and it felt like this reference that labeled me a victim. 'Oh, that's how you deal with those 
people.'" 
Fast-forward to 2020 and Evelyn Yang, no longer just some Manhattan mom but the wife of a 
presidential candidate with a megaphone, sounding  off on CNN about Hadden and her outrage over 
the deal. "It's like getting slapped in the face and punched in the gut," she said. "The DA's office is 
meant to protect us, is meant to serve justice, and there was no justice here." 
All of sudden Vance is doing more than just placating victims in private phone calls, announcing last 
week that the office will reopen Hadden's case. 
"We admire the courage of the survivors who have recently shared their stories," a spokesman said. 
'Their voices will be heard, and the abuse they suffered will be thoroughly investigated." 
Vance has changed his tune on Weinstein too, declaring victory Monday by praising the survivors who 
came forward, without ever acknowledging his own failure to prosecute the movie mogul in 2015 when 
Ambra Battilana-Gutierrez recorded him admitting and apologizing for assaulting her. 
A few days later Vance managed to cede that, "we were looking at that case with 2015 eyes. We weren't 
looking at that case with 2019 eyes." The only difference being that five years ago, the then assistant 
DA who first interviewed Battilana-Gutierrez (which somehow included asking her if she'd ever been a 
prostitute)—and who retired in the middle of the Weinstein trial after much scrutiny—could blow off a 
22-year-old crime victim and no one would know or care. 
Going on about Weinstein, Vance continued to re-write history, saying, "Rape is rape, and sexual 
assault is sexual assault." But back in 2013 he signed a memo on behalf of the District Attorneys 
Association of the State of New York opposing a bill that would've made that legally true. Rape in New 
York is still defined as vaginal penetration, while forced oral and anal sex is defined as a criminal sex 
act requiring only that the prosecution prove genital "contact." The problem came to a head in 2011 
when a jury convicted a cop of sexually assaulting Lydia Cuomo, a Bronx teacher on her way to work, 
but acquitted him of rape because they weren't sure whether or not he'd actually penetrated her. So 
Assemblymember Aravella Simotas, introduced the "rape is rape" bill in 2013 which would consolidate 
the crimes under the rape statute and change the elements necessary to prove rape from genital 
"penetration" to "contact." Vance's letter argued that it could reduce consecutive sentencing options 
for judges, and suggested creating "oral rape" and "anal rape" to address concerns about language. 
EFTA00020537
--- PAGE 4 ---
Seven years later, Simotas is still completely exasperated: "The whole argument about consecutive 
sentencing is a red herring. So long as the prosecutors do their job then they can get consecutive 
sentences. Changing the definition doesn't change the fact that prosecutors have to do their job. It 
doesn't change specific pleading. As long as you explain the elements that you're trying to prove you're 
fine. We're not merging the whole code. Just describe the acts and describe the numbers in the penal 
code in your charging document." 
But just doing the job is exactly where Vance seems to have so much trouble when it comes to powerful 
and privileged men, and why it's galling to watch him praise survivors for their willingness to come 
forward like they haven't been there all along begging him to do something. 
It may be 2020, but he still doesn't get it.

Third-party proposed intervenors The Miami Herald Media Company (the "Miami Herald") and 
investigative journalist for the Miami Herald Julie Brown ("Brown") (collectively, the 
"Intervenors"), have moved pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24 to intervene in this 
defamation action brought by plaintiff 
("M" 
or the "Plaintiff') against 
defendant Ghislaine Maxwell ("Maxwell" or the "Defendant") and to unseal all of the 
documents previously sealed in this action. 
Resolution, clarity and certainty, sometimes delayed, are hallmarks of the judicial process. The 
present motions challenge certain resolutions of this settled and closed action and raise 
significant issues, the conduct of the discovery process, the enforceability of confidentiality 
agreements and protective orders, the privacy rights of parties and witnesses, the public interest 
and the role of the media, and the transparency of the judicial process.

v. Maxwell, — F.Supp.3d — (2018) 
This defamation action from its inception in September 2015 to its settlement in May 2017 has 
been bitterly contested and difficult to administer because of the truth or falsity of the 
allegations concerning the intimate, sexual, and private conduct of the parties and of third 
persons, some prominent, some private. The instant motions renew that pattern and require a 
reexamination of the effort to provide an appropriate resolution of the issues presented by the 
litigation. 
Upon this reexamination and the conclusions set forth below, the motion to intervene is granted, 
and the motion to unseal is denied as to the documents produced in the discovery process and as 
to the summary judgment judicial documents based on the difficult balancing of the conflicting 
principles described below. 
I. Prior Proceedings 
In early 2011 
, in an interview with journalist Sharon Churcher ("Churcher") which was 
published in two British tabloids, described Maxwell's alleged role as someone who recruited or 
facilitated the recruitment of young females for sexual activity with Jeffrey Epstein ("Epstein"), 
that she, M, 
had been interviewed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI") in 2011, 
and that she had discussed Maxwell's involvement in the described sexual abuse. Maxwell 
issued a statement denying this account on March 9, 2011. 
On January 1, 2015, 
moved to join two alleged victims of Epstein who had initiated an 
action under the Crime Victims' Rights Act against the United States, purporting to challenge 
Epstein's plea a reement. 
joinder motion (the "Joinder Motion") included numerous 
details about 
sexual abuse and listed the perpetrators of her abuse. 
repeatedly 
named Maxwell in the Joinder Motion as being personally involved in the sexual abuse and sex 
trafficking scheme created by Epstein. 
*2 On January 3, 2015, Maxwell again issued a statement, responcla 
allegations made in 
connection with 
Joinder Motion. Maxwell stated that 
allegations "against 
Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue" and that 
"claims are obvious lies" (the "January 3 
Statement"). 
filed her complaint in this action on September 21, 2015 (the "Complaint"), settithth 
her claim of defamation by Maxwell arising out of the Maxwell January 3 Statement. 
alleged she was the "victim of sexual trafficking and abuse while she was a minor child" and 
that Maxwell "facilitated" 
sexual abuse and "wrongfully" sub'ected 
to "public 
ridicule, contempt and disgrace" by denying 
allegations. 
further alleged that

v. Maxwell, — F.Supp.3d — (2018) 
over the course of a decade she had been sexually abused at "numerous locations" around the 
world with prominent and politically powerful men. 
Vigorous litigation was undertaken by the parties, as demonstrated by the 950 docket entries as 
of August 27, 2018, including a motion to dismiss the Complaint which was denied by opinion 
of February 29, 2016 (the "February 29 Opinion"). The primary issue presented was the truth or 
falsity of the January 3 statement issued
 Maxwell, which in turn challenged all the previous 
statements made to the press by 
and in 
Joinder Motion. This resulted, 
understandably, in a lengthy and tumultuous discovery process resulting in 18 hearings and 15 
decisions. 
After hearing counsel, it was determined that fact discovery would be completed on July 29, 
2016,2 see Proposed Discovery and Case Management Plan, Aug. 1, 2016, ECF No. 317. Both 
parties early on recognized the extreme sensitivities and privacy interests arising out of an 
effective discovery process involving the truth or falsity of the allegations at issue. The 
consequent protective order was entered into by the parties on agreement, and endorsed by the 
Court on March 17, 2016 (the "Protective Order"), and the sealing order was ordered by the 
Court on August 9, 2016 (the "Sealing Order"), for the purpose of protecting the discovery and 
dissemination of confidential information to be exchanged in this action. See Protective Order, 
ECF No. 62. This Protective Order allowed the parties to provide discovery on highly private 
and sensitive subjects without it being disclosed to the public, absent an additional order of this 
Court. The Protective Order served "to protect the discovery and dissemination of confidential 
information or information which will properly annoy, embarrass, or oppress any party, witness, 
or person providing discovery in this case." ECF Dkt. 62. The Protective Order applied broadly 
"to all documents, materials, and information, including without limitation, documents 
produced, answers to interrogatories, responses to requests for admission, deposition testimony, 
and other information disclosed pursuant to the disclosure or discovery duties created by the 
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure." Id. ¶ 1. 
The panics reserved the right to extend this deadline where the panics so agreed, or for good cause shown. See Proposed 
Discovery and Case Management Plan, Aug. I, 2016, ECF No. 317. 
The Protective Order also provided the procedures to designate any such material as 
confidential, and to challenge such designations. Id. 11118-10. Upon review by an attorney acting 
in good faith, the designating party was to designate certain confidential information as 
"CONFIDENTIAL," triggering a set of protections as to that document for the duration of the 
action. Id. ¶ 8. When a party filed material designated as confidential with the Court, it was to

The necessary exceptions to this rule are as follows: 
[S]uch information may be disclosed to: a) attorneys actively working on this case; b) persons regularly employed or associated 
with the attorneys actively working on this case whose assistance is required by said attorneys in the preparation for trial, at trial, 
or at other proceedings in this case; c) the parties; d) expert witnesses and consultants retained in connection with this 
proceeding, to the extent such disclosure is necessary for preparation, trial or other proceedings in this case; e) the Court and its 
employees ... in this case; f) stenographic reporters who are engaged in proceedings necessarily incident to the conduct of this 
action; g) deponents, witnesses, or potential witnesses; and It) other persons by written agreement of the parties.

*3 At the conclusion of the case, the parties could elect either to return the confidential material 
to the designating party or destroy the documents. Id. ¶ 12. The Protective Order specified that it

Id. 
From March 17, 2016 to August 9, 2016, 26 motions to seal were filed with the Court pursuant 
to the Protective Order, each of which were granted. On August 9, 2016, an order amended the 
Protective Order as follows: 
To reduce unnecessary filings and delay, it is hereby ordered that letter 
motions to file submissions under seal pursuant to the Court's Protective 
Order, ECF No. 62, are granted. The Protective Order is amended accordingly 
such that filing a letter motion seeking sealing for each submission is no 
longer necessary. A party wishing to challenge the sealing of any particular 
submission may do so by motion. 
Sealing Order, ECF No. 348. One hundred sixty-seven documents were sealed pursuant to the 
Sealing Order. 
On August 11, 2016, Intervenor Alan Dershowitz ("Dershowitz" or "Intervenor Dershowitz") 
moved to unseal three documents: (1) portions of a Reply Brief submitted by Churcher in 
support of her motion to quash the subpoena served on her; (2) emails between Churcher and 
submitted in connection with the same motion; and (3) a draft of a manuscript prepared 
by 
submitted in connection with a motion to extend a time deadline. See Dershowitz 
Motion to Intervene, Aug. 11, 2016, ECF Nos. 362-64. Other than the requested documents 
which he sought in order to make a public statement, Dershowitz agreed to be bound by the 
Protective Order. See Dershowitz Decl., ECF No. 363 ¶ 30. On November 2, 2016, the motion 
was denied on the basis that these documents "were submitted with respect to the discovery 
process rather than in connection with the disposition of any substantive issue, and therefore are 
not judicial documents" such that no presumption of access exists. 
v. Maxwell, No. 15 
Civ. 7433 (RWS) (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 2, 2016), ECF No. 496. Appeal has been filed on that 
decision. 
Pursuant to several amendments, a trial date of May 25, 2017 was determined. See Order, Oct.

2016, ECF No. 451; Amended Second Discovery and Case Management Plan, Feb. 27, 2017, 
ECF No. 648; Joint Letter, May 8, 2017, ECF No. 912. 
Expert discovery was completed on November 30, 2016. See id. 
Twenty-nine motions in !Milne were filed by the parties between January 5, 2017 and May 1, 
2017, on which decision was reserved. See ECF Nos. 520, 522, 524, 526, 528, 530, 533, 535, 
561, 563, 567, 608, 663-667, 669, 671, 673, 675, 677, 679, 681, 683, 685-86, 689, 691. 
Maxwell filed a motion for summary judgment on January 6, 2017, which was heard on 
February 16, 2017 and denied by an opinion filed on March 22, 2017. See Sealed Document, 
March 24, 2017, ECF No. 779 (the "Summary Judgment Opinion"). The parties, in accordance 
with the agreed upon procedures, were directed to jointly file a proposed redacted version of the 
Summary Judgment Opinion consistent with the Protective Order. The agreed upon redacted 
opinion was filed with the Court and made public on the docket on April 27, 2017 (the 
"Redacted Opinion"). See Redacted Opinion, April 27, 2017, ECF No. 872. 
*4 On January 19, 2017, Intervenor Michael Cemovich ("Cemovich" or "Intervenor 
Cemovich") made a motion to unseal the materials submitted in connection with Maxwell's 
motion for summary judgment, which the Court denied on May 3, 2017 (the "May 3 Opinion") 
on the basis that Cemovich "ha[d] not established a compelling need for the documents obtained 
in discovery which undergird the summary judgment decision." 
v. Maxwell, No. 15 Civ. 
7433 (RWS), 2017 WL 1787934 (S.D.N.Y. May 3, 2017), ECF No. 892. "This action is 
currently scheduled for trial in mid-May and a release of contested confidential discovery 
materials could conceivably taint the jury pool." Id. 
The parties arrived at a settlement and jointly stipulated to dismiss this action on May 24, 2017. 
See Stipulation of Voluntary Dismissal, ECF No. 916; Joint Stipulation for Dismissal, ECF No. 
919. The settlement presumably is pursuant to the Protective Order and remains confidential 
with terms known only to the parties. This case was closed on May 25, 2017. 
On April 9, 2018, the Miami Herald filed the instant motion, contending that all sealed 
documents in this action are presumptively public under both common law principles and the 
First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and were sealed pursuant to an improvidently granted 
protective order, which allowed the parties to designate information as confidential without the 
particularized judicial scrutiny required by the law prior to sealing. See ECF No. 62. The motion 
was joined by Intervenor Dershowitz, who requested that he be advised of any documents 
unsealed in order to request unsealing of additional documents to protect his interests, and by 
Intervenor Cemovich. Argument was heard on May 9, 2018, at which time this motion was 
considered fully submitted.

v. Maxwell, — F.Supp.3d —(2018) 
H. The Motion to Intervene is Granted 
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24 provides intervention of right under Rule 24(a) to anyone 
who "claims an interest relating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action, 
and is so situated that disposing of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the 
movant's ability to protect its interest, unless existing parties adequately represent that interest." 
Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a). Permissive intervention may be granted to anyone "who has a claim or 
defense that shares with the main action a common question of law or fact." Fed. R. Civ. P. 
24(b). 
Because courts, including this one, "have repeatedly recognized that members of the press 
(and other non-parties) may seek to pursue modification of confidentiality orders that have led 
to sealing of documents filed with the court," and since "the appropriate procedural mechanism 
to do so is a motion to intervene," the motion of Brown and the Miami Herald to intervene is 
granted. See In re Pineapple Antitrust Litig., No. 04 Md. 1628 (RMB) (MHD), 2015 WL 
5439090, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 10, 2015); 
v. Maxwell, No. 15 Civ. 7433 (RWS) 
(S.D.N.Y. Nov. 2, 2016), ECF No. 496 (Opinion Granting Dershowitz Motion to Intervene); 
v. Maxwell, No. 15 Civ. 7433 (RWS), 2017 WL 1787934 (S.D.N.Y. May 3, 2017), ECF 
No. 892 (Opinion Granting Cernovich Motion to Intervene). 
121 PIAlthough the case was closed by the Clerk of Court on May 25, 2017 pursuant to the 
settlement agreement, "intervention for the purpose of challenging confidentiality orders is 
permissible even years after a case is closed." United States v. Erie Cnty., N.Y., No. 09 Civ. 
849S, 2013 WL 4679070, at *6 (W.D.N.Y. Aug. 30, 2013), rev'd on other gds., 763 F.3d 235 
(2d Cir. 2014); see also In re Pineapple Antitrust Litig., 2015 WL 5439090, at *2 ("[T]here is no 
implication in the caselaw or in common sense why the passage of more than three years should 
disable a journalist from seeking unsealing."). Moreover, "[w]hether deemed an intervention as 
of right under Rule 24(a) or a permissive intervention under Rule 24(b), intervention by the 
press-a step preliminary to determining whether any sealed documents should be 
disclosed-should be granted absent some compelling justification for a contrary result." In re 
Pineapple Antitrust Litig., 2015 WL 5439090, at *2 (footnote omitted). 
*5 HIAccordingly, the motion to intervene is granted, and it is appropriate to reopen the case for 
the disposition of the instant motion.

v. Maxwell, — F.Supp.3d — (2018) 
HI. The Issues and the Applicable Standards 
The issues presented by the parties engage vital societal concepts, the privacy rights of 
individuals, the judicial process to establish truth or falsity, the transparency of that process, and 
freedom of information and of the press. On these concepts our Circuit has rendered helpful 
guidance' Because of the nature of this defamation action, the particular allegations at issue 
involving sexual conduct, and the need to be able to rely on court determinations, this motion 
presents a unique pattern for decision. 
See United States v. HSBC Bank USA, N.A., 863 F.3d 125 (2d Cir. 2017) (noting discovery documents lie beyond the presumption 
of public access); Bernstein v. Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann UP, 814 F.3d 132 (2d Cir. 2016) (weighing value of 
public disclosure of complaint against privacy interests in favor of access); Newsday LLC v. Cnty. of Nassau, 730 F.3d 156 (2d Cir. 
2013) (finding First Amendment right of access to contempt proceeding); N.Y. Civil Liberties Union v. N.Y.0 Transit Audi., 684 
F.3d 286 (2d Cir. 2012) (qualified First Amendment right of public access attached to TAB hearings conducted by New York City 
Transit Authority); United States v. Aref, 533 F.3d 72 (2d Cir. 2008) (finding that where classified information presented at trial, if 
disclosed, would jeopardize national security weighed against public access); Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 
(2d Cir. 2006) (existence of confidentiality order alone did not defeat presumption of public access); Hanford Courant Co. v. 
Pellegrino, 380 F.3d 83 (2d Cir. 2004) (establishing qualified First Amendment right of access to sealed docket sheets); Sec. Etch. 
Comm'n v. TheStreetcom, 273 F.3d 222 (2d Cir. 2001) (holding pretrial deposition testimony were not "judicial documents"); 
DiRussa v. Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., 121 F.3d 818 (2d Cir. 1997) (sealing file pursuant to confidentiality agreement between 
parties was not abuse of discretion); United States v. Amodeo, 44 F.3d 141 (2d Cir. 1995) ("Amodeo I") (finding it proper for 
district court to edit and redact judicial document to allow access to appropriate portions after weighing competing interests); 
United States v. Amodeo. 71 F.3d 1044 (2d Cir. 1995) ("Amodeo 11") (presumption of access afforded to particular document filed 
with court varies with document's relevance to exercise of Article III functions); Gardner v. Newsday, 895 F.2d 74, 79 (2d Cir. 
1990) (balancing newspaper's common law right of access with defendant's privacy rights); Joy v. North, 692 F.2d 880 (2d Cir. 
1982) (distinguishing between documents obtained in discovery from those filed pursuant to an adjudication for purposes of the 
"judicial document" determination). 
Legal scholars and jurists have long sought to refine the boundaries of privacy, or "the right to 
be let alone," but the result remains a mosaic, the development of which can be traced more to 
the unraveling of case law than the priority of certain rights over others. See Louis Menand, Why 
Do We Care So Much About Privacy?, THE NEW YORKER, June 18, 2018. 
*6 The legal implications of privacy have been considered in relation to "telegraphy, telephony, 
instantaneous photography (snapshots), dactyloscopy (fingerprinting), Social Security numbers, 
suburbanization, the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, Fourth Amendment 
jurisprudence, abortion rights, gay liberation, human-subject research, the Family Educational 
Rights and Privacy Act, `60 Minutes,' Betty Ford, the 1973 PBS documentary `An American 
Family,' the Starr Report, the memoir craze, blogging, and social media." Id. at 6; see e.g., 
Smith v. Maryland, 442 U.S. 735, 99 S.Ct. 2577, 61 L.Ed.2d 220 (1979) (holding no reasonable 
expectation of privacy in phone numbers dialed); Assoc. Press v. U.S. Dep't of Defense, 554 
F.3d 274 (2009) (finding Guantanamo detainees enjoy a privacy interest in the nondisclosure of 
their names and identifying information in records containing allegations of abuse by military 
personnel and by other detainees); Nat'l Archives & Records Admin. v. Favish, 541 U.S. 157, 
124 S.Ct. 1570, 158 L.Ed.2d 319 (2004) (holding Freedom of Information Act ("FOIA") 
recognizes surviving family members' right to personal privacy with respect to their close 
relative's death-scene images).

v. Maxwell, — F.Supp.3d 
(2018) 
Privacy has also been "associated with privilege (private roads and private sales)," see United 
States v. Knotts, 460 U.S. 276, 282, 103 S.Ct. 1081, 75 L.Ed.2d 55 (1983) (holding that 
defendant enjoyed a reasonable expectation of privacy when driving on his premises, but that no 
such expectation extended to his travel on public thoroughfares), "with confidentiality (private 
conversations)," see Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 351, 88 S.Ct. 507, 19 L.Ed.2d 576 
(1967) (holding that defendant did not shed his reasonable expectation of privacy in holding a 
private conversation in a public phone booth), "with noncomformity and dissent," see Warden v. 
Hayden, 387 U.S. 294, 323, 87 S.Ct. 1642, 18 L.Ed.2d 782 (1967) (Douglas, J., dissenting) 
("Those who wrote the Bill of Rights believed that every individual needs both to communicate 
with others and to keep his affairs to himself. That dual aspect of privacy means that the 
individual should have the freedom to select for himself the time and circumstances when he 
will share his secrets with others and decide the extent of that sharing."), "with shame and 
embarrassment," see Perlman v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 312 F.3d 100, 106 (2d Cir. 2002), 
vacated and remanded, 541 U.S. 970, 124 S.Ct. 1874, 158 L.Ed.2d 464 (2004), aff'd, 380 F.3d 
110 (2d Cir. 2004) (per curiam) (witnesses and third parties "possess strong privacy interests, 
because being identified as part of a law enforcement investigation could subject them to 
`embarrassments and harassment' "), "with the deviant and the taboo ...," see Lawrence v. 
Texas, 539 U.S. 558, 573, 123 S.Ct. 2472, 156 L.Ed.2d 508 (2003) (holding that persons in a 
homosexual relationship may seek autonomy in their consensual sexual conduct in the home just 
as heterosexual persons do), "and with subterfuge and concealment," see U.S. Dep 't of Justice v. 
Reporters Comm. For Freedom of Press, 489 U.S. 749, 763, 109 S.Ct. 1468, 103 L.Ed.2d 774 
(1989) (holding that an individual's interest in nondisclosure of an FBI rap sheet was the sort of 
personal privacy interest that Congress intended FOIA law enforcement exemption to protect); 
see Menand, supra at 6. 
In the law, "privacy functions as a kind of default right when an injury has been inflicted and no 
other right seems to suit the case." Menand, supra at 6. The right to privacy might emanate from 
one or many Amendments to the Constitution. For example, the right prohibiting the 
government from obtaining heat wave information from within one's home by way of 
sense-enhancing technology not in general public use arises from notions of privacy rooted in 
Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, see Kyllo v. United States, 533 U.S. 27, 34, 121 S.Ct. 2038, 
150 L.Ed.2d 94 (2001), while the right of a woman, with certain exceptions, to pursue an 
abortion beyond the state's police powers exists in the zones of privacy arising from the First, 
Fourth, Fifth, Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments, see Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 93 S.Ct. 705, 
L.Ed.2d 147 (1973) (holding that constitutional right of privacy is broad enough to 
encompass woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy, but that this right is 
not absolute in that the state may properly assert important interests in safeguarding health, in 
maintaining medical standards and in protecting potential life). 
*7 The montage of privacy law that has developed around these disparate concepts does not lend 
itself to easy determinations of privacy rights. Nevertheless, certain things enjoy an undisputed

right to privacy: trade secrets, see Kewanee Oil Co. v. Bicron Corp., 416 U.S. 470, 475-76, 94 
S.Ct. 1879, 40 L.Ed.2d 315 (1974) (the holder of a trade secret is protected against the 
disclosure or unauthorized use of the trade secret); sexual activity (although of what kind it 
remains to be determined), compare Lawrence, 539 U.S. 558, 123 S.Ct. 2472 (making it 
unconstitutional to criminalize homosexual relations) with Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438, 92 
S.Ct. 1029, 31 L.Ed.2d 349 (1972) (holding unconstitutional Massachusetts statute permitting 
married persons to obtain contraceptives but prohibiting distribution of contraceptives to single 
persons); and personal characteristics—such as the radiation of heat from one's home, Kyllo, 
533 U.S. 27, 121 S.Ct. 2038, and the unamplified sound of one's voice, Katz, 389 U.S. 347, 88 
S.Ct. 507—which make up Fourth Amendment jurisprudence. These privacy rights, in the 
context of this action, are balanced against the public's right to access rooted in First 
Amendment and common law jurisprudence. 
151 161 171There are two "related but distinct presumptions in favor of public access to court ... 
records: a strong form rooted in the First Amendment and a slightly weaker form based in 
federal common law." Newsday LLC v. Cnty. of Nassau, 730 F.3d 156, 163 (2d Cir. 2013). 
Generally, the public holds an affirmative, enforceable right of access to judicial records under 
both the common law and the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. "The presumption of 
access is based on the need for federal courts, although independent—indeed, particularly 
because they are independent—to have a measure of accountability and for the public to have 
confidence in the administration of justice." United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1048 (2d 
Cir. 1995) ("Amodeo II "). However, "the right to inspect ... judicial records is not absolute. 
Every court has supervisory power over its own records and files, and access has been denied 
where court files might have become a vehicle for improper purposes" such as using records "to 
gratify spite or promote scandals" or where files might serve "as reservoirs of libelous 
statements for press consumption." Nixon v. Warner Commcins, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 598, 98 
S.Ct. 1306, 55 L.Ed.2d 570 (1978); see also Amodeo II, 71 F.3d at 1051 (internal quotation 
marks and citation omitted) ("Courts have long declined to allow public access simply to cater 
to a morbid craving for that which is sensational and impure."). 
IsiPretrial discovery is intended to aid the parties in their search for truth. See Hickman v. Taylor, 
329 U.S. 495, 501, 67 S.Ct. 385, 91 L.Ed. 451 (1947) (celebrating that "[t]he 
deposition-discovery regime set out by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is an extremely 
permissive one to which courts have long `accorded a broad and liberal treatment to effectuate 
their purpose that civil trials in the federal courts [need not] be carried on in the dark,' " and that 
discovery is a powerful tool for "the parties to obtain the fullest possible knowledge of the 
issues and facts before trial."). It is presumed that the trial itself will make the final 
determination of truth or falsity. The boundary between discovery and trial is sometimes, as 
here, blurred. The effort is assisted by the definition of "judicial documents." 
191 1101 1111Whether discovery or trial, "a court must first conclude that the documents at issue are 
indeed `judicial documents.' " Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110, 119 (2d Cir. 
WESTLAW © 2018 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.

v. Maxwell, — F.Supp.3d 
(2018) 
2006); see also id. (noting that "only judicial documents are subject to a presumptive right of 
public access, whether on common law or First Amendment grounds."). If the document is a 
judicial document, courts next ask whether the presumption of access is a product of the 
common law right of access, or of the more robust First Amendment right to access certain 
judicial documents. Id. at 119-20. It is a given accepted by the Protective Order that the trial and 
all trial documents are accessible and public absent special circumstances. 
*8 1121 II3IUnder the common law approach, once a document is classified as a judicial document, 
the presumption of access attaches. Id. at 119. The court must then determine the weight of the 
presumption of access, which is a function of "the role of the material at issue in the exercise of 
Article III judicial power" and "the resultant value of such information to those monitoring the 
federal courts." See id.; Stern v. Cosby, 529 F.Supp.2d 417, 420 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) (internal 
citations omitted) ("the court must determine the weight of the presumption, that is, whether the 
presumption is an especially strong one that can be overcome only by extraordinary 
circumstances or whether the presumption is a low one that amounts to little more than a 
prediction of public access absent a countervailing reason or whether the presumption is 
somewhere in between."). Documents traditionally fall somewhere on a continuum "from 
matters that directly affect an adjudication to matters that come within a court's purview solely 
to ensure their irrelevance." Amodeo II, 71 F.3d at 1049. Such a presumption under the common 
law may be overcome by demonstrating that sealing serves to further other "substantial 
interests," such as "a third party's personal privacy interests, the public's safety, or preservation 
of attorney-client privilege." Under Seal v. Under Seal, 273 F.Supp.3d 460, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 
2017) (collecting cases). 
1141 Ilsillowever, the First Amendment "provides the public and the press a constitutional right of 
access to all trials, criminal or civil." Id. at 468 (citing Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, 
448 U.S. 555, 580, 100 S.Ct. 2814, 65 L.Ed.2d 973 (1980) ) (internal citation omitted). This 
right applies specifically to "related proceedings and records" and "protects the public against 
the government's arbitrary interference with access to important information." N. Y. Civil 
Liberties Union v. N.Y.C. Transit Auth., 684 F.3d 286, 298 (2d Cir. 2012) (citations omitted). As 
noted above, the Protective Order specified that confidential material would not be protected 
with respect to any document proffered at trial. 
The Second Circuit has recognized two approaches for determining whether the First 
Amendment right of access extends to particular judicial records. Lugosch, 435 F.3d at 120. In 
the first approach, the "logic and experience" test, a court evaluates whether the documents are 
those that "have historically been open to the press and general public" and for which "public 
access plays a significant positive role in the functioning of the particular process in question." 
Id. Courts applying the "logic and experience" test have generally found a presumption of 
openness, based on the common law approach. Hartford Courant Co. v. Pellegrino, 380 F.3d 
83, 92 (2d Cir. 2004).

EFTA00020562
--- PAGE 23 ---
v. Maxwell, — F.Supp.3d — (2018) 
In the second approach, First Amendment protection attaches to judicial documents "derived 
from or a necessary corollary of the capacity to attend the relevant proceedings." Id. at 93. 
Accordingly, the Second Circuit has found "the right to inspect [judicial] documents derives 
from the public nature of particular tribunals." Id.; see also id. (observing that "[o]ther circuits 
that have addressed [the] question have construed the constitutional right of access to apply to 
written documents submitted in connection with judicial proceedings that themselves implicate 
the right of access."). 
1161 "I "ITO be clear, the First Amendment creates only a presumptive right of access. Newsday, 
730 F.3d at 164-65. "What offends the First Amendment is the attempt to do so without 
sufficient justification." N.Y. Civil Liberties Union, 684 F.3d at 296. Under either approach, a 
presumptive right of access may be overcome by "specific, on-the-record findings that sealing is 
necessary to preserve higher values and only if the sealing order is narrowly tailored to achieve 
that aim." Lugosch, 435 F.3d at 124. The party seeking to keep the judicial documents under 
seal carries the burden of demonstrating that higher values overcome the presumption of public 
access, DiRussa v. Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., 121 F.3d 818, 826 (2d Cir. 1997), and such a 
showing must be supported by "findings specific enough that a reviewing court can determine 
whether the closure order was properly entered." Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., 
Riverside CnV., 464 U.S. 501, 510, 104 S.Ct. 819, 78 L.Ed.2d 629 (1984). 
IV. The Motion to Unseal the Discovery Documents is Denied 
*9 j191The parties early on agreed that the release of confidential information inherent to the 
discovery process could expose the parties to annoyance, embarrassment, and oppression given 
the highly sensitive nature of the underlying allegations. The parties mutually assented to 
entering into the Protective Order. The parties relied upon its provisions, as did dozens of 
witnesses and other non-parties. Documents designated confidential included a range of 
allegations of sexual acts involving Plaintiff and non-parties to this litigation, some famous, 
some not; the identities of non-parties who either allegedly engaged in sexual acts with Plaintiff 
or who allegedly facilitated such acts; Plaintiff's sexual history and prior allegations of sexual 
assault; and Plaintiff's medical history. The Protective Order has maintained the confidentiality 
of these sensitive materials. One hundred sixty-seven discovery documents were added to the 
docket and sealed pursuant to the Protective Order. 
Further, upon the issuance of an opinion by this Court, the parties were directed to jointly file a 
proposed redacted version consistent with the Protective Order as set forth above. The parties 
submitted the Redacted Opinion to maintain the confidentiality established by the Protective 
Order.

v. Maxwell, — F.Supp.3d — (2018) 
Except as discussed below, the documents sealed in the course of discovery were neither relied 
upon by this Court in the rendering of an adjudication, nor "necessary to or helpful in resolving 
[a] motion." See Alexander Interactive, Inc. v. Adorama, Inc., No. 12 Civ. 6608 (PKC) (JCF), 
2014 WL 4346174, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 2, 2014). Moreover, our Circuit has "long recognized 
that documents `passed between the parties in discovery[ ] lie entirely beyond the ... reach' of 
the presumption of public access." United States v. HSBC Bank USA, N.A., 863 F.3d 125, 139 
(2d Cir. 2017); see also Sec. Exch. Comm'n v. Am. Intl Grp., 712 F.3d 1, 24 (D.C. Cir. 2013) 
("[T]hough filing a document with the court is not sufficient to render the document a judicial 
record, it is very much a prerequisite."). To provide "unthinkable access to every item turned up 
in the course of litigation would be unthinkable." Amodeo II, 71 F.3d at 1048. Accordingly, the 
motion to unseal the discovery documents is denied. 
V. The Summary Judgment Judicial Documents 
1201 1211Under the common law and First Amendment, the primary inquiry is whether the 
documents at issue are "judicial documents." To be a judicial document, "the item filed must be 
relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process," Lugosch, 
435 F.3d at 119; see HSBC Bank USA, N.A., 863 F.3d at 134 ("The threshold merits question in 
this case is whether the [sealed document] is a judicial document, as only judicial documents are 
subject to a presumptive right of public access, whether on common law or First Amendment 
grounds."). In making such a determination, courts consider the "relevance of the document's 
specific contents to the nature of the proceeding" and the degree to which "access to the 
document would materially assist the public in understanding the issues before the ... court, and 
in evaluating the fairness and integrity of the court's proceedings." Bernstein v. Bernstein 
Litowitz Berger & Grossmann LLP, 814 F.3d 132, 139 (2d Cir. 2016) (citing Newsday LLC, 730 
F.3d at 166-67) (alteration omitted). 
1221 123IDocuments filed with the court vary in their status as `judicial documents.' At one end of 
the continuum, "[t]he mere filing of a paper or document with the court is insufficient to render 
that paper a judicial document subject to the right of public access." United States v. Amodeo, 44 
F.3d 141, 145 (2d Cir. 1995) ("Amodeo I "). Likewise, the filing of "deposition transcripts, 
interrogatories, and documents exchanged in discovery" with a court is not sufficient to reach 
the status of judicial document, and to consider them as such "would constitute a radical 
expansion of the `public access' doctrine." HSBC Bank USA, N.A., 863 F.3d at 139 (citing 
Amodeo II, 71 F.3d at 1048); accord Joy v. North, 692 F.2d 880, 893 (2d Cir. 1982) ("Discovery 
involves the use of compulsory process to facilitate orderly preparation for trial, not to educate 
or titillate the public. Private matters which are discoverable may, upon a showing of cause, be 
put under seal under Rule 26(c), in the first instance."). At the other end, the "case law is clear 
that pleadings and summary judgment papers ... are judicial documents upon filing." Id. at

v. Maxwell, — F.Supp.3d 
(2018) 
141-42. The Second Circuit has repeatedly held that all documents submitted in support of a 
motion for summary judgment, whether or not relied upon, "are unquestionably judicial 
documents under the common law." Lugosch, 435 F.3d at 123. The same applies for complaints. 
See Bernstein, 814 F.3d at 140 (internal citation omitted) ("A complaint, which initiates judicial 
proceedings, is the cornerstone of every case, the very architecture of the lawsuit, and access to 
the complaint is almost always necessary if the public is to understand a court's decision."). 
*10 124ISomewhere in the middle lie documents "submitted ... in support of a motion to compel 
discovery [which] ... presumably will be necessary to or helpful in resolving that motion. They 
are, therefore, judicial documents." Alexander Interactive, Inc., 2014 WL 4346174, at *2; see 
also In re Omnicom Grp., Inc. Sec. Litig., No. 02 Civ. 4483 (RCC) (MHD), 2006 WL 3016311, 
at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 23, 2006) (internal citation omitted) (finding that a "series of letter briefs 
with accompanying exhibits ... certainly qualify as judicial documents" because they are 
"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process."). 
1251The Summary Judgment Opinion refers to facts drawn from Maxwell's Memorandum of Law 
in Support of Maxwell's Motion for Summary Judgment; Maxwell's Rule 56.1 Statement of 
Material Facts; 
Statement of Contested Facts and 
Undisputed Facts; and 
Maxwell's Reply to 
Statement of Contested Facts and 
Undisputed Facts 
pursuant to Local Civil Rule 56.1 (the "Factual Statements"). 
The Factual Statements, citing the evidence upon which they rely, formed the basis of or the 
recital of both uncontested and disputed material facts contained in the Summary Judgment 
Opinion. The recital and the Factual Statements constitute the evidentiary mirror of the issues 
presented by the Complaint. That recital described the issues to be resolved at trial, if, as was the 
case, the summary judgment was denied. This portion of the Summary Judgment Opinion and 
the Factual Statements (the "Summary Judgment Judicial Documents") reveals the substance of 
the evidence jointly deemed confidential by the parties. It was therefore redacted by the parties. 
126lAs a matter of law, papers submitted in support of the summary judgment motion are 
"judicial documents" triggering a presumption of access subject to balancing under the First 
Amendment and common law if they "directly affect an adjudication." Lugosch, 435 F.3d at 123 
("As a matter of law, we hold that the contested documents—by virtue of having been submitted 
to the court as supporting material in connection with a motion for summary judgment—are 
unquestionably judicial documents under the common law."). The Summary Judgment Judicial 
Documents are therefore judicial documents subject to a presumption of access. 
VI. The Motion to Unseal the Summary Judgment Judicial Documents is Denied

v. Maxwell, — F.Supp.3d 
(2018) 
InlIntervenors contend that the Summary Judgment Judicial Documents should be unsealed 
because they carry a strong presumption of access under both the First Amendment and 
common law, and there are no compelling reasons to keep them sealed. 
iniBecause it has been determined that the Summary Judgment Opinion and the materials 
submitted in connection with it are judicial documents, the weight of the presumption under the 
common law must be determined, in addition to any countervailing factors. See Bernstein, 814 
F.3d at 143 (citing Lugosch, 435 F.3d at 119-20) (internal quotation marks omitted) (noting that 
the 
final 
step of the 
inquiry as to the summary judgment 
papers 
is 
the 
"weight-of-the-presumption analysis: balancing the value of public disclosure and 
countervailing factors."). 
Intervenors assert that because Defendant's motion for summary judgment fits squarely into the 
definition of a judicial document, those materials are entitled to the strongest presumption of 
access. Maxwell contends that the Intervenors are not in a position to determine the weight of 
the presumption afforded each summary judgment document because they have not seen each 
document. 
*11 j291While the Summary Judgment Judicial Documents are entitled to a presumption of 
access, this presumption is less "where a district court denied the summary judgment motion, 
essentially postponing a final determination of substantive legal rights, [because] the public 
interest in access is not as pressing." See Amodeo II, 71 F.3d at 1049 (quoting In re Reporters 
Comm. for Freedom of the Press, 773 F.2d 1325, 1342 n.3 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (internal quotation 
marks omitted) (emphasis in original) (alteration added) ). Because the motion for summary 
judgment was denied by the Court on March 22, 2017, the Summary Judgment Judicial 
Documents are entitled to a lesser presumption of access. 
1301"Notwithstanding the presumption of access under both the common law and the First 
Amendment, the documents may be kept under seal if `countervailing factors' in the common 
law framework or `higher values' in the First Amendment framework so demand." Lugosch, 435 
F.3d at 125. At common law, the presumption of access may be overcome by demonstrating that 
"sealing will further other substantial interests such as a third party's personal privacy interests, 
the public's safety, or preservation of attorney-client privilege." Under Seal, 273 F.Supp.3d at 
467; see Amodeo II, 71 F.3d at 1050 (describing law enforcement interests and privacy of third 
persons as factors that weigh against the presumption of access); United States v. Aref, 533 F.3d 
72, 83 (2d Cir. 2008) (affirming a sealing order "[g]iven the legitimate national-security 
concerns at play"); Lugosch, 435 F.3d at 125 (stating that attorney-client privilege "might well 
be ... a compelling reason" to overcome the presumption of access); see also Sec. Exch. Comm'n 
v. TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d 222, 234 (2d Cir. 2001) (noting that where the presumption in favor 
of public access does not apply, and a document was filed under seal pursuant to a protective 
order, "a strong presumption against public access" applies if a party to the protective order 
objects on privacy grounds and establishes "reasonabl[e] reli[ance] on the protective order.").

EFTA00020566
--- PAGE 27 ---
v. Maxwell, — F.Supp.3d 
(2018) 
Here, the primary countervailing factor is "the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure." 
Amodeo II, 71 F.3d at 1050; see also Gardner v. Newsday, 895 F.2d 74, 79 (2d Cir. 1990) 
("[T]he common law right of access is qualified by recognition of the privacy rights of the 
persons whose intimate relations may thereby be disclosed."). The Second Circuit has 
repeatedly held that "[t]he privacy interests of innocent third parties ... should weigh heavily in a 
court's balancing equation." Id. at 79-80; see also Amodeo II, 71 F.3d at 1051 ("Such interests, 
while not always fitting comfortably under the rubric `privacy,' are a venerable common law 
exception to the presumption of access."). 
13111n assessing the weight to be accorded an assertion of a right of privacy, "courts should first 
consider the degree to which the subject matter is traditionally considered private rather than 
public." Amodeo II, 71 F.3d at 1051. For example, "[f]inancial records of a wholly owned 
business, family affairs, illnesses, embarrassing conduct with no public ramifications, and 
similar matters will weigh more heavily against access than conduct affecting a substantial 
portion of the public." Id.; but see United States v. Silver, No. 15 Cr. 93 (VEC), 2016 WL 
1572993, at *6 n.5 (S.D.N.Y. April 14, 2016) (emphasizing that "the expectation of privacy in 
an amorous relationship where official government business and personal benefit are intertwined 
is necessarily less than an amorous relationship between wholly private citizens or between a 
private citizen and a government official where there is no intersection with state business. In 
the case of the former, there is the ever-present risk of public scrutiny and a legitimate public 
interest in ensuring that government officials are acting in the public's interest rather than in the 
private interest of a paramour."). 
*12 This is a defamation case involving the truth or falsity of the underlying allegations of the 
sexual assault and sexual trafficking of minors involving public and private persons. The 
Summary Judgment Judicial Documents openly refer to and discuss these allegations in 
comprehensive detail. This establishes a strong privacy interest here. 
The "nature and degree of injury must also be weighed," which means that consideration must 
also be given to "the sensitivity of the information and the subject but also of how the person 
seeking access intends to use the information." Amodeo II, 71 F.3d at 1051. 
The privacy interests of Maxwell, 
Dershowitz, as well as dozens of third persons, all of 
whom relied upon the promise of secrecy outlined in the Protective Order and enforced by the 
Court, have been implicated. It makes no difference that 
and Dershowitz have chosen to 
waive their privacy interests to the underlying confidential information by supporting this 
motion, as Maxwell has not agreed to such a waiver. 
More importantly, the dozens of non-parties who provided highly confidential information 
relating to their own stories provided that information in reliance on the Protective Order and the 
understanding that it would continue to protect everything it claimed it would. This interest is 
WESTLAW © 2018 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works. 
EFTA00020567
--- PAGE 28 ---
v. Maxwell, — F.Supp.3d — (2018) 
amplified where, as here, the Summary Judgment Judicial Documents "contain sensitive and 
personal information about the sexual abuse of [ 
minor[s]." Kavanagh v. Zwilling, 997 
F.Supp.2d 241, 256 (S.D.N.Y. 2014). To disregard this protection now would be to implicate the 
rights of dozens of individuals who shared private information under the trusted understanding 
that it would remain sealed. See Gardner, 895 F.2d at 79 ("[T]he privacy interests of innocent 
third parties as well as those of defendants that may be harmed by disclosure of the Title III 
material should weigh heavily in a court's balancing equation.... The job of protecting such 
interests rests heavily with the trial judge, since all the parties who may be harmed by disclosure 
are typically not before the court."). 
The same considerations apply under the First Amendment, where the "presumption is 
rebuttable upon demonstration that suppression `is essential to preserve higher values and is 
narrowly tailored to serve that interest.' " Hartford Courant Co., 380 F.3d at 96 (quoting 
Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Riverside Cnty., 464 U.S. 501, 510, 104 S.Ct. 
819, 78 L.Ed.2d 629 (1984) ) (internal citation omitted). What must be determined is the "harm 
to a compelling interest," Under Seal, 273 F.Supp.3d at 469, balanced against, in this case, a 
generalized public interest. So long as "specific, on the record findings are made demonstrating 
that `closure is essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest,' 
" the documents may be sealed. In re N.Y. Times Co., 828 F.2d 110, 116 (2d Cir. 1987) (citing 
Press-Enterprise Co., 464 U.S. at 510, 104 S.Ct. 819). 
The compelling interest is the privacy interest discussed above. It is also the integrity of the 
judicial process. 
The parties by their conduct have demonstrated reliance on the Protective Order and its 
provisions. It is not necessary to have forty years of judicial experience to know that reliance on 
the confidentiality agreement with respect to the evidence relating to the truth or falsity of the 
allegations was a significant, if not determinative, factor in the confidential settlement 
arrived at. That one of the parties to that settlement, 
, no longer opposes unsealing does 
not vitiate the strength of the agreement. Indeed given the entire context of the litigation it may 
demonstrate the need to compel the parties to stick to their bargain. See id. (noting that this 
Circuit is instructed to "give added weight to fair trial and privacy interests where requiring 
disclosure will have a potential chilling effect on future movants."). 
*13 While the Intervenors cite to the public interest, there are no particulars identified that point 
to the need for evidence gathered from the period from 2015 to 2016 concerning events that 
took place over 15 years ago. See Lugosch, 435 F.3d at 125 ("Notwithstanding the presumption 
of public access ..., the documents may be kept under seal if ... `higher values' in the First 
Amendment framework so demand."). 
Further, as the Supreme Court noted in Nixon v. Warner Communications, Inc., 435 U.S. at 589, 
S.Ct. 1306, "courts have the power to insure that their records are not used to gratify private

v. Maxwell, — F.Supp.3d 
(2018) 
spite or promote public scandal, and have refused to permit their files to serve as reservoirs of 
libelous statements for press consumption." (internal quotation marks omitted). 
The unsealing of the Summary Judgment Judicial Documents would both promote scandal 
arising out of unproven potentially libelous statements—particularly in light of the allegations 
relating to the sexual abuse of minors by public figures, and defeat the compelling privacy 
interests of the parties and non-parties who relied on the Protective Order. 
In light of the above, the "extraordinary circumstances," Stern, 529 F.Supp.2d at 420, have been 
established. The common law and First Amendment presumptions of access have been 
outweighed in favor of maintaining the sealing agreed upon by the parties and relied upon by 
third parties. 
VII. Conclusion 
Based on the facts and conclusions set forth above, the Intervenors' motion to intervene is 
granted, and this motion to unseal is denied and the action is closed. 
It is so ordered.

Thank you, Ariel. 
As a result of this new law, victims of childhood sexual abuse 
whose voices were never heard and whose stories were never 
told have now been given a new chance to come forward, to 
share their experiences, and to vindicate their rights; 
All of these goals are wholeheartedly shared by our Office, 
which is committed to using the federal criminal law to the 
maximum extent possible to investigate and prosecute those 
who sexually abuse and traffic minors. 
As many of you know, several months ago our Office brought 
criminal sex trafficking charges against Jeffrey Epstein, a serial 
predator. 
To bring that prosecution, we relied on the courage of many 
young women who were victimized as minors and who were 
willing -- years after their abuse — to share their stories. And 
while Epstein committed suicide before he could face trial, our 
investigation into his co-conspirators continues. 
I have said publicly before, we can only do the work we do with 
the assistance of victims willing to come forward. 
By providing victims of childhood sexual abuse with a new 
opportunity to be heard, this law marks not only an important 
step for victims' rights but will help facilitate the work of law 
EFTA00020574
--- PAGE 2 ---
enforcement in identifying and prosecuting those who prey on 
our most vulnerable. 
I want to thank Safe Horizon for inviting me to this important 
event. As the country's largest victim services organization, 
Safe Horizon provides support on a daily basis to victims of 
human trafficking, sexual assault, and child exploitation. This 
work is incredibly important -- and incredibly challenging. 
Our Office knows that it takes great courage for victims of 
trafficking and assault to report their experiences to law 
enforcement. It also takes coordination, trust, and 
partnerships between service providers like Safe Horizon and 
prosecutors. 
For years, our Office has received case referrals from Safe 
Horizon and we look forward to continuing our partnership to 
hold traffickers and predators accountable and to seek justice 
for victims of violence.

Hi 
I left you a voicemail, but wanted to follow up via email as well. 
Our Regional Office reminded me that we need a written request from your office to produce the documents 
you seek. It does not have to be a subpoena. An email from you requesting the investigation documentation 
will suffice. 
Thank you,

Possible Suicide Attempt 
On July 23, 2019 at approx. 1:27 a.m., a call for assistance on the Special Housing Unit 
was announced by the Control Center. Upon my arrival I was informed that an inmate 
had attempted suicide and proceeded to cell, Z05-124LAD. I observed inmate 
Epstein, Jeffrey #76318-054 lying in the fetal position on the floor of his cell wearing a 
t-shirt and boxers. He was breathing heavily and was snoring. I called out to inmate 
Epstein and observed him flicker his eyes and continue snoring. 
His neck was red 
with no abrasions. I observed no further injuries to his person. An attempt was made 
to get the inmate to stand on his own with negative results. The inmate was placed in 
hand restraints and staff was directed to retrieve the stretcher. As inmate Epstein was 
being placed on the stretcher by responding staff, he would open his eyes and observe 
staff. When staff made eye contact with him, he would hurriedly shut his eyes. The 
inmate was taken to HA-Unit, dressed in the suicide smock and placed on suicide 
watch. While awaiting the arrival of an inmate companion, inmate Epstein sat on the 
edge of the bed and began moving forward as if he was attempting to fall over head 
first. When I looked away, he straightened up. As I turned to look at him again, he 
attempted the same act. I laid him down on the bed and directed him to cease his 
action or he would be placed in restraints for his safety. At that moment, he stated, 
"Okay, I won't do it again," and gave the thumbs up. Because of his unpredictable 
behavior, the decision was made to have a staff member observe inmate Epstein. I 
left HA-Unit in order to make staff notifications. Moments later, I spoke with Officer 
who stated that inmate Epstein was alert and had indicated that his cellmate, 
artaglione, Nicholas #78514-054 had attempted to kill him and had been harassing 
him. He stated that the inmate had indicated that he'd informed his attorney of this 
matter. 
I photographed and spoke with inmate Tartaglione, Nicholas #78514-054 who stated 
that he was asleep with his headphones on when he felt something hit his legs and 
said, "Jeff, what you're doing?" He didn't answer, so he got up, turned on the light and 
saw him with a string around his neck. He stated that he then called the guards and

they ran down. Upon f...ner questioning, inmate Tartaglione ...tated that he sleeps on 
the bottom bunk, but gave it to inmate Epstein because he's old. He stated that he 
sleeps on the floor on a mattress. He stated that when he got up, he couldn't 
remember if he sat up or stood up to check on Epstein. He stated that Epstein was 
sitting on the floor leaning to the side with his eyes opened, but wasn't responding. He 
stated that the last time he saw him he was snoring really loud. 
Inmate Epstein stated that he came in from a legal visit at approx. 8:00PM and staff 
handed him a copy of the Daily News. "Nick" was on the floor reading the Daily News. 
He stated that he had given it to him. He stated that Tartaglione mentioned that he'd 
been in court all day in Westchester and was carrying on. At that point, inmate 
Tartaglione paused as if he was making the story up as he went along, and stated that 
Tartaglione stated, "These fucking niggers. This place is inhumane, I wish I could 
report it. 
(Officer), that nigger hobbit mother fucker." He then turned to a page in 
the Daily News that had his picture on it and stated that Epstein was worth seventy 
seven million dollars. Epstein stated that he took his picture, balled it up and threw it in 
the garbage. I asked inmate Epstein what happened prior to staffs arrival. He stated 
that at approx. 1:00 AM, he'd gotten up to get a drink of water, as he gets up every 
thirty minutes. He remember walking back to his bunk and waking up with staff there 
in his cell. I asked if he'd waken up and seen staff, why didn't he respond when we 
were calling out to him? He stated that he only remembered hearing himself making a 
noise like snoring. When asked about the allegations against his cellmate, he stated 
that he was told, if he hurt him, staff wouldn't care. 
Duty medical, Dr. 
was notified and briefed. It was determined no further 
medical attention was needed. A medical assessment was not conducted at the time 
of this incident, due to the fact, there was no medical staff available after 10:00 PM. 
e 
arrival of medical staff, inmate Epstein was examined and treated by, MLP 
for a circular line of erythema at the base of the neck, one section on the front 
with marks of friction and a small erythema on his left knee.

We just got word from C-19 that Epstein made a phone call last night to Kristina Schuliak (ph), who is his current / latest 
girlfriend, around 7:00 p.m. The agents contacted her, she said she wanted a lawyer, and the agents have now heard from 
her lawyer who says she'll tell them about the content of the phone call but she wants some kind of protections. It 
sounds like the girlfriend is willing to talk sooner rather than later, so whenever someone is assigned to the new 
investigation, we can put him or her in touch with that agent for whatever follow-up is appropriate.

It's correct that SONY doesn't have it. I don't know who the FOIA request is directed to — whether it's just to our office or 
to FBI or DOJ as a whole. I think the office's practice on this case is to forward all FOIA inquiries to 
who is 
handling them as the main point of contact.

Pursuant to the Court's Order of this afternoon, we write to schedule a telephonic meet and confer on issues relating to a 
protective order in the above-captioned case. Please let us know what time you are available today between 5:00 p.m. 
and 8:00 p.m., or tomorrow between 9:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m. In particular, it would be helpful to get the defendant's 
current position on the following: 
- 
Whether you are aware of any case in any federal district in which a protective order was entered in a criminal 
case that prevented the Government from showing its own documents to prospective witnesses or their counsel 
without requiring restrictions upon those witnesses and their counsel; 
EFTA00020670
--- PAGE 2 ---
Whether you are able to describe any expected reason why it would be necessary or useful for the defendant to 
reference by name — rather than by pseudonym or other anonymized identifier — any victim in a public statement 
or publicly-docketed filing (and rather than by sealed filing, if such named identification is necessary), such that 
the Government may consider whether it can formulate language to address any such concerns, without 
conceding any right of the defendant to name any individual who has self-identified as a victim of Jeffrey Epstein 
or Ghislaine Maxwell at any time; and 
Whether the defense is willing to itself propose any language to address the Government's concerns in relation 
to the issue described immediately above, regarding the defendant's desire to be able to reference by name any 
victim in a public statement or publicly-docketed filing, without conceding that any such right exists. 
Additionally, also relating to the production of discovery, please mail, or otherwise have delivered, a 1 terabyte hard drive 
for purposes of the Government's discovery production. While we are in the process of determining the size of an initial 
production, and the size may total substantially less than 1 terabyte, that will ensure our ability to make a robust initial 
production and should be suitable for subsequent productions as well. That can be sent to my attention at our Office.

Very good to hear from you, and I apologize for the delay in replying to your voicemail from Friday — I was on trial 
last week so have spent the past couple days digging out from under piles of emails and voicemails. But we'd be 
happy to speak with you regarding the subpoenas to the 
ntities in connection with the Epstein 
investigation. We had been in touch with Steve D'Allessandro, who was very helpful, but he also mentioned that 
they might bring in outside counsel. 
If you let us know a couple times that would work for you tomorrow or Friday—and I'm copying my colleagues

who are also working on the case—we'll get a quorum on our side and finalize a time. And 
please let us know if any other information would be useful in the interim.

In particular, we're requesting the receiving bank name and account number information for each of the above 
transactions, as well as any other associated details. Could you please provide that information? Or if you 
already have, could you please point us in the right direction—I've looked through the production index to try to

We've received some additional documents in this same production we'd like to include in the same general subfolder on 
Relativity ("BSF second production" under "BSF returns"), please. I'm sending them in a separate folder link so that they 
don't mess up your process with the initial results; they're here: 
Usa.doj.gov\ clouaNYS StAndrews \Shared \ USvEpstein-2018R01618 InvestigationVI 2018 SDNY investigation \Subpoena 
Returns \ Boies Schiller 2019-04-23 Boies Schiller second subpoena response (follow-up) 
Please note there are a few things from that folder that do NOT need to be uploaded — the folder titled "!Original Zips" 
and the two PDF documents (in the main folder) don't need to go onto Relativity. And I think I neglected to give similar 
info for the original folder linked to below ("2019-04-18, Boies Schiller second subpoena response") — in that folder, we do 
not need the "!Original Zips" folder or its contents, and do not need the three PDF documents in the main folder to be 
uploaded. 
As always, please let me know if any questions or issues, and thanks very much.

Following up on the below, and for the same case — US v. Epstein (USAO # 2018R01618) — could we please load the

In terms of structure, they can go under the "BSF returns" subfolder (under the folder "Subpoena Returns") under a new 
subfolder identified as "BSF second production". And under that, we'd like to keep the same folder structure as exists at 
the link. Does that work? 
And I don't believe there is DVD information (as in the "BSF first production" documents), but if there is, please let us

That's no problem, we don't need those on Relativity. Separately, though will we be able to play those video files *not* 
on a DVD? That is, we only have them in electronic format (in the file folders) — I haven't tried to play them, so maybe it's 
just as easy as that, but wanted to check if we need to get them processed in some other fashion to be able to view 
independently of a DVD player.

Hi 
▪ 
Hi Jack! Hi Brad! How you guys doing? 
JS: 
We're doing fine, thank you. I'm sorry for all of the trouble and before we go any 
further, let me tell you, if I have your permission, I have started a tape recorder and I 
want to be able to tape this conversation from the very beginning. Is that alright with 
you? 
▪ 
Sure, that's fine, Jack. No problem 
JS: 
Ok, good, thank you. I appreciate that. Let me start off by introducing myself. I know 
that Brad has spoken to you about me but I am Brad's lawyer, and I assume that you can 
confirm that you and I have never had any communication before. Is that right? 
▪ 
That's correct. 
JS: 
Alright. I have, however, gotten some information from Brad about conversations that 
you have had with him, and that will enable me, hopefully, to make this a little bit more 
efficient and take up a minimum amount of your time while still getting the information 
that we think is going to be helpful to us and to any jury that might ultimately have to 
hear these facts. 
So, let me begin by asking you first to tell us what your full name is. 
That's my maiden name. My married name is

Yes, he did. He did all the time. The worst one that I heard from his own mouth was this 
pretty 12 year old girls he had flown in for his birthday. It was a surprise birthday gift 
from one of his friends and they were from France. I did see them, I did meet them. 
Jeffrey bragged afterwards after he met them that they were 12 year olds and flown over 
from France because they're really poor over there, and their parents needed the money 
or whatever the case is and they were absolutely free to stay and flew out. Those were 
the worst ones. He was constantly bragging about girls' ages or where he got them from 
or their past and how terrible their past was and good he is making it for them. 
JS: 
Where were the 12 year old girls flown to from France? Where did they come to? 
II 
Palm Beach. 
JS: 
And were they flown in on Jeff's private plane or did they get transported? 
No. They were transported by somebody else. 
JS: 
Ok. Was the sexual activity that went on on the airplane conducted in such a way so that 
any of the crew was aware of what was going on? 
They were told to knock if they had to come out, if the crew had to come out. They were 
told, you know, to come out as little as possible, so they weren't out there hanging out 
watching everything, no, but it doesn't take an idiot to put two and two together to say 
well there's a whole bunch of half dressed teenagers on board with this old man who is 
constantly being massaged by them and he wants me to keep the door shut for what 
reason? I mean, only they could put that together, but yeah, they knew. 
JS: 
Did Mr. Epstein ever talk to you about people of power and influence owing him favors? 
He would laugh about it, you know, I never really knew what to take serious from Jeffrey 
because he was such a funny character at times. You never knew if what he was saying 
was true or not. Yeah, lots of people owed him favors from what he told me. He's got 
everybody in his pocket, and he would laugh about he helps people for the sole purpose 
in the end they owe him something. That's why I believe he does so many favors in the 
first place. 
JS: 
When and how did you first become aware that Mr. Epstein was in trouble with the law? 
I was first informed by, I think someone from the FBI called me first and started to ask 
me questions, and I started to answer the questions but then fear took over, and I just said 
look, I don't know what's going on, I've got a young family that I don't want to risk, you 
know, please don't bother me about this again, and it was real short simple conversation, 
and within a week or 2, I had gotten a call from Jeffrey's attorney, and then a week later, 
Jeffrey himself.

JS: 
Ok, well let's back up before we get to those conversations and tell me approximately 
when it was that you were contacted by the person who you believe was with the FBI. 
Ok. It's hard for me to pinpoint, if I had to pinpoint it, it would be in 2007 sometime. 
JS: 
Alright. And you were living in 
at that time, correct? 
Correct. 
JS: 
You were contacted by telephone? 
That's correct, by my cell phone. 
JS: 
Ok and do you have any idea how your name came up leading to that contact. 
No idea. No idea whatsoever. When I did ask, I was told that some girls had revealed 
my name, I guess, and that's how everybody, the FBI knew to contact me. 
JS: 
OK. 
But I don't know offhand or sorry, I just walked into the wrong room. 
JS: 
Ok. 
Sorry go on. 
JS: 
Yes & I'll never tell her you said that. 
how long was it after that phone call 
from the FBI person were you contacted by Mr. Epstein's lawyers. 
Like a week. It was back to back to each other. I remember being so scared after talking 
to the FBI thinking what's happening, what's going on. It's been like 6 years, 7 years at 
that stage, how did they find me & what do I have to do with this? So yeah, I do 
remember that very well, and it was only about a week later I was called by his attorney. 
JS: 
Who was it that contacted you, do you remember? 
I want to say Bill Riley, but he might have been from the FBI. No, it was Bill Riley. Bill 
Riley. Not sure if that's his correct name, but that's what is coming to mind 
JS: 
What do you remember about that conversation? 
I : 
I remember a Mr. Goldberger as well, I remember, there might have been two of them. 
JS: 
Alright.

II
I can't remember which one it was. I want to say Bill Riley is the good one. 
IS: 
Alright, so either Bill Riley or a Mr. Goldberger or both of them contacted you, and what 
do you remember about that? 
I don't know if it was the same guy who contacted me that week later who put me in 
touch with Jeffrey. I think he was on the phone and he put speakerphone on with Jeffrey. 
So he connected me with Jeffrey. I don't know if it was the same guy or different, but I 
definitely know that Bill Riley was the first guy to contact me. I'm pretty sure about that. 
JS: 
Ok. Tell me about that conversation. 
II
He asked me what I knew about what's going on with Jeffrey and apparently, there was 
an investigation being held about some of the girls who had come out and said that 
Jeffrey had sexual contact with them under the age of a minor and that he was 
discrediting lot of these girls and making them out to be drug addicts and prostitutes and 
what have you so they wouldn't be looked upon as worthy in the court's eyes so to speak. 
And you know, he told me in the first five minutes that, you know, if I stay quiet, that 
"I'll be looked after" . And that was the exact way it was said. It wasn't like you know, 
I'm gonna pay you a zillion dollars or anything if you be quiet, but if I stay quiet, I would 
"looked after". And I remember saying I don't want any part to do with this. You know, 
this is not something I want to be a part of, I've got a young family. I wish the best for 
everybody in this, you know, take care kind of thing. A week later, I was called after the 
hearing by one of Jeffrey's lawyers. I can't tell you exactly which one it was but he had 
Jeffrey on the other line and he connected Jeffrey and I, and Jeffrey tried to make some 
simple conversation, "How are you? How have things been?" You know what I mean, 
catching up. 
JS: 
Do you know if the lawyer, did the lawyer stay on the line while Jeffrey was speaking to 
you? 
I'm pretty sure he did. That's why I think Jeffrey was on speaker phone bera'ise it 
sounded a lot different, and I was never taken off the line to begin with or connected to 
another line, so I was pretty sure Jeffrey was on speaker phone and the lawyer was 
making the call. After the simple conversation, it led to what was going on again and you 
know, Jeffrey couldn't believe it. You know, he thought he helped all these girls out. He 
didn't think he was wrong in any circumstance here at all. A lot of these girls were drug 
addicts and just after drug money. You know, he was really putting down these women 
or these girls I should say, not giving them the credit they deserved, and then he exactly 
repeated what the lawyer said the week before is that he would look after me if I stayed 
quiet, and if I need any help, you know, his lawyers would represent me and he would get 
legal help for me, whatever I need, he would do, and I told him exactly, I said, "Jeffrey, 
I'm the mother of two children at that stage. I'm away from everything there, I don't 
want to be a part of it. I'm not going to speak to anybody and I don't want to speak to 
anybody, I don't want to be involved." That was the last time I heard from him. And the

next thing I knew, I was sent my victim's letter, my notification of being a victim through 
the US Attorney's Office and that's when I knew it was well out there enough not to have 
Jeffrey's lawyers come back on me and discredit me in the same way he had done to all 
the other girls. So, I called up Joseph Bird who was the recommended lawyers on my 
paperwork that they had given me and started going from there. 
JS: 
So you contact Mr. Joseph Bergs' office and then you were dealing with his office from 
that point forward. 
That's correct. 
JS: 
Tell me about the ending of your relationship with Jeffrey. That is, at what point in time 
did your full time employment end and how did that happen? 
Ok. So, it hadn't really ended. I walked away from it all. Jeffrey sent me to Thailand 
where I met my husband and escaped to Australia, never to return back to the states. 
About 6 months prior to that, he came up with a proposition that I thought was really 
disgustingly sick. And it really showed me for the first time in 4 years I had been with 
him that nothing was going to change and I was always just going to be used by him(?) 
which I did not like. He offered me a mansion and some of his money every month, I 
forget what he called it, a monthly income of what he made to bear one of his children. 
The proposition was that if anything ever happened between Jeffrey and I, that I would 
have to sign my child over to him basically and that the child would be his and 
Ghislaine's, and I would be looking after it as long as nothing happened between Jeffrey 
and I. So, I was kind of freaked out by all of that. I pushed Jeffrey more to please get me 
some more training, you know, and I was getting older and not of as much interest to 
Jeffrey anyways. I was 19 now, and he likes a female a lot younger. So he sent me to 
Thailand, in September 2002_. I was first supposed to meet a girl there and bring her 
back with me, but I never met up with her. I proceeded get a short course in Thai massage 
so that was to shut me up about my training so I went there, and one of my friends from 
school invited me to watch a fight, like a muay thai fight, which is like a form 
kickboxing. So I went and watched it, and I saw this guy that was a really good fighter, 
and a girl's word, looked really hot, so I asked my friend who knew him to introduce me. 
We got introduced and fell in love immediately, 3 days later 
proposed and 7 days 
later I was being married in a buddist temple. I called Jeffrey and told him I'm sorry, I'm 
never coming back. I've gotten married, I've fallen in love. I thought he'd wish the best 
for me but he was kind of rude and he just said "have a good life" and hung up the phone, 
and that was the last time I'd talked to him ever until all this started again. 
JS: 
Ok. 
is there anything else that you would like to add to what you have told us 
up to this point in time? 
I'd like to know that this time around something's going to be done about it and that 
Jeffrey and a lot of his colleagues, no matter how rich they are, will know that there is

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA 
CASE NO. 08-80736-CIV-MARRA 
JANE DOE //I and JANE DOE #2, 
Petitioners, 
vs. 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, 
Respondent. 
DECLARATION OF JANE DOE 3 
1. 
The Court is familiar with me from my previous declaration in this case. I am currently 
years old and want to become a part of the case to enforce my rights and possibly allow 
criminal prosecution ofleffrey Epstein and others who abused underage girls. 
2. 
I have seen a Government filing saying that I waited too long before trying to become a 
part of this case. I don't think that the Government's position tells the full story about me. In 
fact, I believe tlx: Government is hiding some of the things that it knows about me and about 
other powerful people involved in this case. I am filing this declaration so that the Court will 
have more facts to make the decision about whether to let me come into the case. 
3. 
In its latest filing, the Government seems to be questioning why I was afraid and did not 
come forward to speak more quickly. To understand my reasons, it is important that I share at 
least some additional information about why I was so fearful after my abuse by Epstein and 
others. 
4. 
The Court can best understand my situation by looking at my previous declaration and 
then understanding why I was afraid of Epstein, how I eventually escaped from him, and how I 
was forced to hide from him and others. 
5. 
I first met Epstein when I was 15 years old. I have told the Court about some of my 
sexual and physical abuse in my earlier declaration. 
6. 
As a result of that abuse and my considerable interactions with Epstein and his friends, I 
knew that Epstein was connected to some of the most powerful people in the world, including a 
member of the British Royal family, a former President of the United States, and other very 
powerful lawyers, politicians and businessmen. I was afraid of what would happen if I tried to 
escape from Epstein or report him to law enforcement.

Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 310-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/06/2015 Page 3 of 28 
13. 
Part of my fear comes from physical abuse that I suffered when Epstein forced me to 
have sex with other people. Without going into the details of the sexual activities I was forced to 
endure, there were times when I was physically abused to the point that I remember fearfully 
thinking that I didn't know whether I was going to survive. 
14. 
Jeffrey Epstein knew about this physical and sexual abuse because I would detail it for 
him as part of my debriefing. Epstein didn't care. Epstein said things like, "You get that 
sometimes." I told him how much I hated having to be with some people, but Epstein still sent 
me back. I had no choice. 
15. 
give the Court this information so that it can better understand why I was so afraid of 
Epstein and what he could do to me. I could provide more details to the Court, if the Court needs 
more details on this issue. I also wanted to provide this information to the Court because I have 
been accused of being a "serial prostitute." I don't think that is a fair way to describe my 
situation, given that I was so young and so many powerful people were forcibly abusing me.

17. 
After years of abuse and being lent out, I began to look for a way to escape. I had been 
first forced into all this because I wanted to be a massage therapist. Epstein had taken me into 
his clutches through promises and talk. But once he had me under his control, I felt trapped. 
18. 
I kept asking Epstein for my promised training and education. Epstein finally got me a 
plane ticket to Thailand to go to Chaing Mai to learn Thai massage. This sounded like my 
chance to escape. In September 2002, I packed my bags for good. I knew this would be my only 
opportunity to break away from Epstein. 
19. 
On September 27, 2002, I flew from MK in New York to Chaing Mai, Thailand. I 
arrived around September 29 for my training. But Epstein was going to get something out of this 
as well. I was supposed to interview a girl to bring back to the United States for Epstein. 
20. 
Exhibit I is a list of room charges in Thailand, with the charges going to Epstein's 
account. This exhibit shows Epstein's telephone numbers and is evidence that he paid for my 
hotel in Thailand. 
21. 
Exhibit 2 is a set of documents showing my itinerary and flight plans for me going to 
Thailand, paid for by Epstein. 
22. 
I did the massage training in Chiang Mai. I met a truly great and special guy and told him 
honestly what I was being forced to do. He told at I should get out of it. I told him that the 
people I was working for were very powerful and that I could not disobey them without risking 
my life. He told me he would protect me, and I had confidence in him. I saw my opportunity to 
escape and to be with someone who truly loved me and would protect me. To make a long story 
short, I married him and flew to Australia. 
23. 
I called Epstein and told him I was not coming back. Ile asked why? I said "I've fallen 
in love." And Epstein basically just said "good luck and have a good life." I could tell he was 
not happy. I was very afraid of what he was going to do to me. I thought Epstein or one of his 
powerful friends might send someone to have me killed. 
24. 
I stayed in Australia from that point on, with my husband and away from the life I had 
been forced to live as Epstein's sex slave. I was in Australia from late 2002 to October 2013. To 
be clear, I was never in the United States during these years, not even for a short trip to visit my 
mother. And my absence from the United States was not voluntary — I was hiding from Epstein 
out of fear of what he would do to me if I returned to the United States.

25. 
In around 2007, after not hearing from anyone for years, out of the blue I was contacted 
by someone who identified himself with a plain sounding name and claimed lie was with the 
FBI. It seemed very odd for someone doing an official criminal investigation to just call up on 
the phone like that. I hadn't heard Epstein's name for years. I didn't know who this person was 
and what it was really about. I wasn't sure what was going on. 
26. 
This man said he was looking into Jeffrey Epstein. The man asked if I had been involved 
with Epstein. My first instinct was to say nothing; because I wasn't sure he was really with the 
FBI or any authorities. I did answer a few basic questions, telling him that I knew Jeffrey 
Epstein and met him at a young age. The whole conversation didn't feel like it was right. This 
rum never offered to come and meet with me in person. He instead asked me right off the bat 
about Epstein's sexual practices. I thought it would be strange for a real law enforcement officer 
to behave that way. 1 became increasingly uncomfortable and suspicious about who was actually 
calling me. 
27. 
The way the conversation was going made me doubt whether I was really talking to an 
FBI agent. It did not seem very official. I became very uncomfortable, so I told him nothing 
more about Epstein. The conversation probably didn't even last three minutes. The conversation 
immediately triggered all of the fears of Epstein and his powerful friends that had caused me to 
escape the first time. If the call accomplished anything, it only put me back in fear and told me 
that I could be found quite easily and had nobody official protecting me. 
28. 
I suspected that the man who called me was working for Epstein or one of Epstein's 
powerful friends. If the man who called me was really an FBI agent and was interested in what I 
knew about Epstein, I thought he would have made some effort to see me personally. I believed 
that if this was really an agent who was investigating Epstein, then he knew who 1 was and how I 
fit into Epstein's sexual crimes in many different places. Such an agent would send someone to 
meet me in person (who could provide potential protection from Epstein). lie never did. 
29. 
Getting a call from this supposed FBI Agent made me very scared. I had left that old life 
behind me and started a new life in a new country in hopes that the powerful people whose 
illegal activities I knew all about would never find me. And now 1 had been tracked down by 
someone and was frightened. 
30. 
Shortly after this purported FBI call, I was contacted by someone who was clearly 
working for Epstein. This person discussed an investigation into Epstein, and said that some of 
the girls were saying Epstein had sexual contact with them. After they made those allegations, 
they were being discredited as drug addicts and prostitutes. But, on the other hand, if I were to 
keep quiet, I would "be looked after." The fact that this call came in right after the FBI call 
reinforced my concern that the man I had talked to earlier was not really working for the FBI, but 
was really working for Epstein. I didn't think that the FBI and Epstein would both be working 
together and would both get my phone number at almost exactly the same time. I played along 
and told this person that I had gotten a call from the "FBI" but that I didn't tell them anything. 
The person was pleased with that.

31. 
A short time later, one of Epstein lawyers (not Alan Dershowitz) called me, and then got 
Epstein on the line at the same time. Epstein and his lawyer basically asked again if I was going 
to say anything. The clear implication was that I should not say anything. The way they were 
approaching me, I was afraid of what would happen if I didn't keep quiet My thought was that if 
I didn't say the right things, I might get hurt. 
32. 
I promised Epstein and his lawyer that I would keep quiet. They seemed happy with that 
and that seemed to me the way to most likely keep me and my family safe. And I did what 
Epstein and his lawyer told me— I kept quiet. 
33. 
now understand that Epstein reached a non-prosecution agreement with the federal 
government in 2007 and pled guilty to two state crimes in June 2008. No one told me anything 
about those events until much later. In fact, nobody called or came to see me to explain what a 
non-prosecution agreement was, what crimes Epstein could have been charged with, why he was 
not being charged with the crimes he committed, or anything whatsoever about the case. I was 
never offered a chance to meaningfully confer with the prosecutor for the Government, and I was 
never notified of any hearing that could affect me or my rights as a crime victim to ever bring 
charges. 
34. 
On September 3, 2008, the FBI sent a victim notification letter to me. This was the first 
written communication I had received from the FBL The letter was attached as Exhibit 1 to my 
earlier statement This kind of written communication, on official FBI stationary, is the way that 
I thought the FBI really communicated with people that they wanted to talk to. The fact that I got 
this official letter from them made me wonder even more whether that the call I had received 
earlier was really from the FBI. The letter that I got did not mention that anyone from the FBI 
bad ever called me before. 
35. 
The letter started off with the sentence: "By virtue of this letter, the United States 
Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida provides you with the following notice 
because you are an identified victim of a federal offense." That sentence (among others) made it 
seem like this was the first time the FBI was officially contacting me. That was the first time I 
was told about my rights as a crime 
36. 
I did not know what was happening about any criminal prosecution of Epstein at this 
time. I wanted him prosecuted. And given his constant illegal sexual behavior, I thought it was 
obvious that he should be prosecuted. But after reading the letter, I was confused. The letter did 
not explain what was actually happening or what role, if any, that I could play. In fact, the letter 
thanked me for my assistance during the investigations, yet it wasn't clear what that was 
referring to. 
37. 
Also, the letter did not directly say that Epstein's crimes against me were not going to be 
prosecuted. It just said that "the United States has agreed to defer federal prosecution in favor of 
this state plea and sentence . . .." I did not know what that meant. The letter did not inform me 
how it applied to me. The letter also said that there was "litigation between the United States 
and two other victims regarding the disclosure of the entire agreement between the United States 
and Mr. Epstein." Understanding more about that case now, I realize that the letter did not

Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 310-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/06/2015 Page 7 of 28 
explain that the real purpose of that litigation was not to get "disclosure of the entire agreement" 
but instead to get criminal charges filed against Epstein and to uphold the rights of Epstein's 
victims. I wish that the Government had told me that was what was really going on. 
38. 
I saw on the letter that I could call a lawyer. The letter also mentioned Jack Goldberger, 
who 1 knew to be Epstein's attorney, which scared me. I first got in touch with the attorneys at 
the Podhurst Orseck firm. My lawyers filed a lawsuit against Epstein for me, which mentioned 
that I was abused by Epstein and other powerful people. I was hoping that the information I 
gave as part of my lawsuit might help to put Epstein away in prison -- where he belongs. But the 
lawsuit ended up just being about money, which Epstein paid to settle. 
40. 
At this point, since nothing else seemed to be working to get Epstein and his associates 
held accountable, I wanted to try by myself to get a message out to the public about what terrible 
things Epstein and his friends had done to me and other girls. I was very disturbed about how no 
one was prosecuting Epstein for these crimes. I was also very scared. It seemed that law 
enforcement was not doing anything with the information they knew about me, which left me 
and my family more vulnerable and scared. 
41. 
The journalist printed an article using some of the information I told her. Shortly after 
the article was published, I talked on the phone to Marie Villafafta, a federal prosecutor from 
Florida. 1 had seen her name on the official letter from the FBI, so she seemed legitimate. 
Villafafta seemed very interested in my case and seemed like she really wanted to do something. 
42. 
Within a few weeks of the newspaper article being published, two FBI agents also called 
me in Australia and then came to meet me. In around March 2011, they met we at the U.S. 
Consulate in Sidney. They seemed to be very professional and hard working. I thought to myself 
that I had finally gotten the attention of the people that I wanted to and that these people would 
do the right things against Epstein and the other criminals. I also thought that they could protect 
me. 
43. 
When I met with the agents, they mainly focused on Epstein. But while there, I provided 
them some information about some of the others who were involved in illegal acts as well. I was 
aware that a false statement to these law enforcement officers was a crime and I told the truth —
giving them the information that I could recall at the time about the individuals they inquired 
about. 
44. 
Tlx agents were clearly prepared to meet me and already knew a lot about Epstein's 
crimes. The agents appeared to be very good at investigating and seemed like they really knew 
how to piece together the whole story. But at the same time, they seemed like they were being 
blocked from doing what they wanted to do — which I thought was to arrest Epstein and his 
powerful friends for all of their illegal sexual crimes.

45. 
During my interview with the real FBI agents, I told them about my contact from the 
purported FBI agent. They did not tell me that it had been a legitimate call from the FBI. 
46. 
The interview I did with these FBI agents was very stressful for me. My meeting lasted 
for several hours. It was not easy to talk about all these difficult things, but I went through it. I 
was crying at points in the interview. The interview also placed stress on my marriage, because 
my husband had to listen to all the terrible things that happened to me. It was difficult %r me to 
have to discuss being passed around as a sex object among powerful people. It was very hard for 
both of us. 
47. 
The agents had come from Florida to meet with me in Australia and took my information 
which gave me reason to believe that Epstein could still be prosecuted for the crimes he 
committed against me. I was not told even at that point that he could not be prosecuted for the 
crimes he committed in Florida. I was not told about the CVRA case or that there was any other 
option for me to enforce my rights. In fact, by the agents meeting with me I believed I was doing 
exactly what I needed to do to enforce my rights and assist in the prosecution. 
48. 
I have seen the Government's recent brief trying to keep me from joining this case. In 
that brief, the Government says about me "the Government is aware that petitioners' counsel 
have been representing her [that is, me] since at least as early as March 2011." This is 
completely untrue, and I think the Government knows it is untrue. I was not represented by legal 
counsel in March 2011. The Government has to know that I didn't have an attorney then, 
because I didn't have an attorney when I met the agents in Sydney. I don't understand why the 
Government is giving false facts to the court. 
50. 
In around April 2011, as a follow-up to my earlier call with Brad Edwards, I got a 
telephone call from him and another attorney, Jack Scarola. 
They just wanted general 
information about whether various people had information relevant to the lawsuit. They told me 
that they were taping the conversation, and I had no problem with that. I cooperated with them 
and gave them information about which people had information relevant about Epstein's crimes. 
Because it was over the phone and we did not know each other very well, they were very polite 
and did not ask me a lot of details about specifically who I had sex with and what sexual 
activities I was forced to participate in. It was a general, background interview. 
51. 
As the months following the FBI meeting in Sydney passed, I was trying to be patient but 
I began wondering what was going on about prosecuting Epstein. I continued to be very 
confused about what was happening. I was hoping that some kind of prosecution would come 
out of it. But when nothing came of it, I got very upset. I wanted to do something to stop 
Epstein and the other people he associates with from sexually abusing girls. Law enforcement

had taken my detailed statements, but nothing seemed to be happening. I wasn't sure what to do. 
While I wanted to do all that I could to get justice for what had happened to me, it was very hard 
for me to figure out how to get something done in the United States while I was living in a 
foreign country; especially after I had already gave information to the FBI that I believed they 
were using to investigate and eventually arrest Epstein. 
52. 
In October 2013, I returned to the United States for the first time since I had left for 
Thailand. 
53. 
In April 2014, I decided to get back in touch with the FBI. 
In Sydney, the FBI had 
seemed like they wanted to be helpful to me, and I have great respect for the FBI agents who met 
me. It appeared to me they wanted to do the right thing in this case. But my feeling was once 
the agents collected information about crimes committed against me, someone else stepped in 
and blocked them from getting charges filed. I also thought that Marie Villafafta really wanted 
to do the right thing and hold Epstein accountable for the horrible crimes he committed. But, it 
seemed like the hands of Villafafia and the FBI were always tied by someone else with more 
authority. 
54. 
I have never been able to figure out who was (and still is) stopping a prosecution. I also 
haven't been able to figure out who is trying to stop me from being able to participate in a court 
case to a have a judge determine whether my rights have been violated. It doesn't seem fair to 
me that the Government can argue that 1 don't even get the opportunity for a judge review the 
issue. To ne, this is thither verification of Epstein's power, which continues to make me very 
scared. 
55. 
I have asked the FBI to show me the video surveillance and other pictures of me that I 
believe they have in their possession. They said that I would have to go to the pmsecutors to get 
them. But the prosecutors will not share anything with me. I believe that the prosecutors have 
lots of information that will support what I have been saying about Epstein and his associates. 
56. 
Based on my knowledge of Epstein and his organization, as well as discussions with the 
FBI, it is my belief that federal prosecutors likely possess videotapes and photographic images of 
me as an underage girl having sex with Epstein and some of his powerful friends. I don't 
understand why they aren't moving forward with what the FBI has given to them. I also don't 
understand why these pictures haven't been given to me nor why law enforcement officers from 
any other jurisdictions have never contacted me. 
57. 
It was not until 2014 that I first understood about the way in which Jane Doe No. 1 and 
Jane Doe No. 2 were trying to invalidate the non-prosecution agreement to allow prosecution of 
Epstein for crimes he committed against them, and me. I had never really heard anything 
significant about this case while I was in Australia, and it was hard to get information about what 
was happening in Florida while I was overseas. Once I heard about the case, I quickly wanted to 
become a part of it. 
58. 
In light of the way everything has played out, I believe that my rights as a crime victim 
have been violated. It was never my choice to become the victim of crimes by Epstein and the

people he forced me to have sex with. Epstein dragged me into his web when I was very young 
and, after that, it was hard for me to escape. After I ran away to Australia, it appears that Epstein 
reached an agreement in 2007 with the federal prosecutors in Florida blocking him from being 
prosecuted for the crimes he committed against me. 
59. 
When Epstein pled guilty to two low level crimes in 2008 as part of his agreement, no 
one told me what was happening or that this plea had anything to do with preventing prosecution 
of crimes against me or the hundreds of other girls he abused. Nobody told me that I could speak 
to the Judge or that a hearing was even taking place. 
60. 
Based on all the facts I have described here, I believe some kind of major cover-up is 
going on to protect Epstein As I look back on what Epstein and his friends have done, I see a lot 
of powerful people who knew what they were doing to me and other girls was wrong. But they 
also seemed to think that they were above the law and they had nothing to worry about From 
what I can see, that turned out to be true. There are less powerful people -- like the FBI agents 
and Marie Villafafta — that seem like they are trying to get the right thing done. But nothing 
happens. 
61. 
Because nothing is being done, it makes me think that Epstein was right when he told me 
he had so many people in his pocket. Maybe those people are still helping him escape being 
prosecuted for what he did against me. The justice system doesn't seem to respond to the 
victims in this case. It seems to favor those who have the most money and power and influence. 
62. 
I am also worried that this is a very dangerous circuit. By standing up for what is right, 
I'm worried that Epstein, or others named here, will come after me. I wonder where this is going 
to go if the United States government is not on my side. I am intent on seeing this through so 
that Epstein isn't allowed to hurt other young girls. I can't stop abuse everywhere in the world. 
But if I help one victim then I have made a positive difference. 
63. 
In April 2014, I asked two good attorneys — Brad Edwards and Paul Cassell — to see if 
they could help me bring Epstein and his friends to justice. They agreed to add me to the 
existing case. They explained to me that the lawsuit was not asking to get money from Epstein 
or others. I understand and have always understood that the goal of the case is to simply enforce 
my rights as a crime victim— rights that were wrongly taken from me. 
64. 
I want Epstein and the others who committed crimes against me to be punished fairly —
the way other less powerful would be. I also want to be added to the suit filed by the two girls, 
Jane Doe Number I and Jane Doe Number 2, and I want to have rights the way a victim of a less 
wealthy and powerful criminal would have. 
65. 
Epstein and his friends sexually and physically abused many other girls. They did this in 
many places around the world. I personally observed this. There are also many people who 
could confirm what I am saying. I hope that these people will come forward and tell the truth. I 
hope that they will call my attorney in Fort Lauderdale, Florida — Brad Edwards — so that all 
ofthe information can be presented to the court about what has happened to me and others.

66. 
Because of how often Epstein and others were having sex with young girls, and how 
much it was a centerpiece of their lives, I doubt they have just stopped. It also seems to me that, 
when I knew them, they believed that they were above the law — too powerful to be prosecuted. 
That feeling has no doubt been reinforced by the fact Epstein has escaped real punishment with 
his plea bargain, and the others with whom he traveled have completely escaped. I hope that 1 
can join this case and try to bring them to justice. 
67. 
I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.

DECLARATION OF 
1. My name is 
and I was born 
2. I was molested by Jeffrey Epstein as a minor on dozens of 
occasions in his mansion in Palm Beach, Florida from around 2002 
to 2005. I understand that evidence collected from Mr. Epstein's 
home showed conclusively that I was there as a minor, along with 
many other underage girls. Given how many girls Epstein was 
abusing, there could not have been any doubt in anyone's mind that 
had access to the testimonial and other evidence that Epstein 
molested me (and many others). 
3. I cooperated fully with the FBI while they investigated Epstein's 
illegal activities with minors. 
4. During the investigation, Epstein had investigators following and 
harassing me. I continued to cooperate with the investigation 
despite this intimidation. 
5. In late 2007, FBI agents met in person with me. During this 
meeting, the agents explained that Epstein was also being charged 
in State court and may plea to state charges related to some of his 
other victims. I knew the State charges had nothing to do with me. 
During this meeting, the Agents did not explain that an agreement 
had already been signed that precluded any prosecution of Epstein 
for federal charges against me. I did not get the opportunity to 
meet or confer with the prosecuting attorneys about any potential 
federal deal that related to me or the crimes committed against me. 
6. My understanding of the agents' explanation was that the federal 
investigation would continue. I also understood that my own case 
would move forward towards prosecution of Epstein. 
7. Confirming my understanding, in about January 2008, I received a 
letter from the FBI that told me that "this case is currently under 
investigation. This can be a lengthy process and we request your 
continued patience while we conduct a thorough investigation." 
My understanding of this letter was that my case was still being 
investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving forward on 
the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against me. 
EFTA00020758
--- PAGE 3 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 361-26 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/10/2016 Page 3 of 5 
8. At this time, I was not told about any non-prosecution agreement 
or any potential resolution of the federal criminal investigation I 
was cooperating in. If I had been told about a non-prosecution 
agreement, I would have objected. 
9. Criminal prosecution of Epstein for crimes against me was 
extremely important to me. I wanted to be consulted by the 
prosecutors before any resolution. In light of the letter I had 
received, I had confidence that I would be contacted by the federal 
government before it reached any final resolution of the 
investigation into my case and that I would likely be needed to 
testify if the case went to trial, which I was willing and anxious to 
do. 
10. 
When I had not heard from the prosecuting attorney for a 
while, I met with attorney Brad Edwards wanting him to find out 
when Epstein was going to be federally charged and prosecuted for 
the crimes he committed against me and others. Epstein's 
investigators were harassing me, and that interfered with my life 
dramatically. My attorney, Mr. Edwards, was hired to make sure 
the prosecutor knew how eager I was to have Jeffrey Epstein 
prosecuted, and I understand that he did convey that to the 
prosecutors numerous times in around June 2008. 
11. 
At some point, I understood that Mr. Edwards was getting 
responses from the prosecutor that were making him suspicious of 
the motivations of the U.S. Attorney's Office. I then understood 
that Mr. Edwards' suspicions were that the prosecutors were 
conferring with Epstein and not with me and the other victims. 
12. 
I authorized Mr. Edwards to do anything possible to ensure 
that Epstein was prosecuted, and that I was able to meet with 
prosecutors and participate in the process. I agreed to file a lawsuit 
against the U.S. Attorney's Office to get them to speak with me 
about any possible case resolution or the terms and to answer 
questions about the case, and to generally treat me fairly, to notify 
me about any court hearing, and to otherwise enforce my rights as 
a crime victim. 
EFTA00020759
--- PAGE 4 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 361-26 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/10/2016 Page 4 of 5 
13. 
Towards the end of June, 2008, I did not attend Jeffrey 
Epstein's guilty plea hearing in state court involving another 
victim of Epstein's abuse. I did not have reasonable notice of the 
hearing, and I did not have any reason to attend that hearing 
because no one had told me that this guilty plea was related to the 
FBI's investigation of Epstein's abuse of me. I had always 
understood generally that the State and Federal criminal systems 
were different and that one had nothing to do with the other. 
Based on what the FBI had been telling me, I thought they were 
still investigating my case. If I had been told that this plea had 
some connection to blocking the prosecution of my case, I would 
have attended and tried to object to the judge and prevent that plea 
from going forward. Many other victims would have done the 
same. I think that after hearing from me and some of the other 
girls who were abused by Epstein, a judge would not have allowed 
such a plea deal to go forward. It is my belief that the US 
Attorney's Office and Epstein's attorneys conspired to prevent my 
attendance at this hearing as well as the attendance of the many 
other victims. 
14. 
I learned about the existence of a secret non-prosecution 
agreement only in July 2008, after my lawyer had filed court 
pleadings trying to give me a chance to talk to prosecutors about 
my case. I would never have learned of that agreement if I had not 
authorized my attorney to sue the United States. Nobody would 
have. 
15. 
I wanted to cooperate in the prosecution more than anything 
else in my life; I was scared of Epstein; I was scared of what he 
had done to me and others, and of how he was continuing to harass 
me, and also what he could do to me and others. The criminal case 
against Epstein was my main focus in life. 
16. 
When I attended a court hearing with Mr. Edwards in federal 
court, I learned for the first time that my rights had been 
extinguished through a secret deal between the prosecutors and Mr. 
Epstein. I received no explanation about exactly how the deal 
occurred or about whether my rights were gone forever. The 
EFTA00020760
--- PAGE 5 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 361-26 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/10/2016 Page 5 of 5 
prosecutors were, at that time, trying to even keep me from seeing 
a copy of the secret plea deal. I wanted to meet with the 
prosecutors and tell them why they should prosecute my case, but 
it became clear that without ever talking to me, they had bargained 
my case away. 
17. 
In about 2010, I had the chance to meet with the U.S. 
Attorney, Mr. Wilfredo Ferrer. I told him all about how I had been 
mistreated in the process. Mr. Ferrer seemed to be interested in 
this, but nothing ever came of the meeting. And unfortunately it 
seems to me that Mr. Ferrer's office is continuing to try to block 
me and other girls from learning anything about the secret deal 
with Epstein or how our rights were violated, even though they 
know what they did was wrong. 
18. 
I later came to understand that crime victims in the federal 
system have the right to meaningfully confer with the prosecutor 
for the government in the case, which at least means to explain 
how my case would be concluded; the right to be heard at 
important hearings; and the right to be treated with "fairness." I 
strongly believe that the way I was treated was unfair and violated 
my rights. 
19. 
I think that the secret non-prosecution agreement should be 
declared illegal and that I should have the right to have crimes 
against me prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney's Office, and that Mr. 
Epstein should be treated the same as other defendants with less 
money and connections are treated for these crimes. 
20. 
I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true 
and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief. 
Executed this 2p. 
, day of January, 2015.

DECLARATION OF 
1. My name is 
- and I was born in 
2. I was paid by Jeffrey Epstein to interact sexually with him as a minor 
on dozens of occasions in his mansion in Palm Beach, Florida from 
around 2002 to 2005, and also to bring him other girls who were my 
approximate age for the same purposes. I understand that evidence 
collected from Epstein's home showed conclusively that I was there 
as a minor, along with many other underage girls. Given how many 
girls Epstein was sexually abusing, there could not have been any 
doubt in anyone's mind that had access to the testimonial and other 
evidence that Epstein sexually molested me as a minor (and many 
others). 
3. My son was very young when the FBI came to speak with me the first 
time. I did not know what to do and I was scared. I called Epstein, 
who told me not to worry and that he would hire an attorney for me. I 
believed that if I told the truth about what happened at Epstein's 
house, the police would take my baby from me. That made me really 
scared. 
4. Through the attorney that Jeffrey Epstein obtained for me, it was 
arranged for me to give a statement to the prosecutor investigating 
Epstein. 
5. While with the attorney Epstein obtained for me I gave a statement to 
the prosecutor that was favorable to Epstein. The prosecutors knew 
the truth because of the volume of evidence they had, and they 
continued to recognize me as a victim of Epstein's crimes. 
6. I had been greatly intimidated, which is why I could not be truthful 
initially and I wanted to end the threat of the possibility of my child 
being taken. My involvement with Epstein from a very young age 
was a deep, dark secret and Epstein told me to keep it a secret. I knew 
that I was expected to keep it a secret. 
7. The more I thought about what was going on, the more I realized that 
what Epstein had done to both me and my friends was wrong and that 
anyone who was not very wealthy would be punished. At this time, I

--- PAGE 3 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 361-27 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/10/2016 Page 3 of 4 
wanted Epstein held accountable the same way anyone else would be. 
I spoke about this with one of my friends around May 2008. I then 
called an attorney, Brad Edwards, around June 2008, understanding 
that he was hired to get the prosecutors to talk to us and hear the truth 
from me. That was especially important to me because I was fmally 
represented by someone other than Epstein's attorney and wanted to 
talk to the prosecutors about everything I knew. 
8. The prosecutors had a lot of information revealing the truth about the 
situation at Epstein's house. I had lot of information, too, because I 
was one of the young teenagers who had brought many other young 
teenagers to Epstein for the purpose of getting paid by Epstein. I 
wanted to assist the prosecutors in the investigation. I hired Mr. 
Edwards to let them know that I was cooperative and ready to tell 
them all of the helpful information I had. I understood that Mr. 
Edwards did that. 
9. I authorized Mr. Edwards to join me in the lawsuit against the U.S. 
Attorney's Office to enforce my rights and to try to get me my chance 
to confer with the prosecutors before Mr. Epstein took a plea or the 
case was resolved in any way. I just wanted to be treated fairly in the 
process. 
10. When Epstein pled guilty to a state crime at the end of June 2008, 
no one notified me that his plea had anything to do with my case 
against him. I did not know, for example, that this plea had some 
connection to a crime he committed against me particularly. In fact, 
at this young age, I had no idea what was going on and nobody tried 
to explain it to me. 
11. In July 2008, I attended a federal court hearing with Mr. Edwards. 
It was then that I learned for the first time at that hearing that the 
prosecutors worked out some sort of secret deal with Epstein that 
might block his prosecution for crimes against me. It also appeared 
that there was a lot of continued communication between Epstein and 
the U.S. Attorney's Office. I was really upset that the U.S. 
Attorney's Office seemed like it would not talk with me or the other 
victims about what was going on. It was easier to get them to talk to 
me when I was represented by Epstein's attorney.

--- PAGE 4 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 361-27 Entered on FLSD Docket 02/10/2016 Page 4 of 4 
12. I wanted to see this secret deal that the Government had with 
Epstein, but they would not give it to me at the hearing. Later, the 
other victims and I finally got to see the secret deal after the judge 
forced the prosecutors to show it to us. 
13. I understand that I did not initially help the investigation by 
speaking on Epstein's behalf untruthfully. But I was intimidated and 
had good reason to protect myself and my son — reasons that I think 
everyone who was talking to me could obviously see. Also, the 
agents and attorneys obviously had a lot of evidence that provided 
proof of what Epstein had actually done. Epstein was still supporting 
me, providing me a lawyer and in my mind protecting me, so I was in 
a position where I felt I had to say certain things. And Epstein 
expected me to say those things. 
14. Once I wanted to cooperate and tried to cooperate, I was never 
given the opportunity to confer with prosecutors from the time they 
were informed by my attorney that I was a cooperating witness. I was 
never told about the secret deal until after it was already concluded. I 
would have had my attorney object if I had been given the chance. 
15. I don't feel like I was treated fairly in this process. And I know 
Epstein got a really good plea deal because he is rich and powerful. 
That doesn't seem fair either.

In terms of structure, we'd like to create a folder identified as "Subpoena Returns" (at the same level as "FBI Case File" is 
currently), and in a subfolder within Subpoena Returns, a folder titled "BSF returns," and within that a subfolder identified 
as "BSF first production" that the dots in the above link can be deposited into (including any additional subfolders). Does 
that work?

--
Following are some numbers you requested. 
1. Total number of email files obtained for the 5 subjects 4 approximately 516,000. 
This does not count attachments (e.g., correspondence, drafts, final documents, press report, etc.) as 
separate files. 
Note that for subjects who left the USAO during the pendency of the Epstein case, there are fewer, and 
that the line AUSA (who remained involved with the CVRA litigation until mid-2019) accounts for the vast 
majority of the files. 
2. It is our best ballpark estimate that we determined approximately 3,000 unique emails were directly relevant to 
OPR's investigation, but we certainly considered a larger universe. 
3. Our best (most useful) collection of scanned-in USAO hard copy documents is from the CVRA litigation, and 
includes both the production to petitioners (3,754 pages), and a separate collection of privileged 
documents/records (about 15,267 pages) that were submitted to the court (and that remained privileged). We 
also have hundreds of pages of other case documents in both hard copy format and electronically, but they are 
largely duplicative of these two sets and are difficult to quantify. 
We hope this is helpful.

Date: Fri, 17 Jul 2020 22:26:45 +0000 
Marc, Andy, 
Following up on our conversation yesterday, we wanted to briefly confirm a few things we discussed and also respond to 
your question. To reiterate, we agree that your plan with respect to the materials you have identified in the New York 
residence makes sense, i.e., to have the photographs scanned and then produced to us in electronic format. To the extent 
we need any originals of materials initially produced electronically in that fashion, we will of course follow up. 
Additionally, and related, to the extent there are materials that are more conducive to being produced in their original 
format, such as the photo book you mentioned specifically, we can receive those in hard copy. As a general matter, I think 
those would only be materials that cannot be individually scanned or copied without removing them from some relevant 
contextual placement or arrangement; that said, if you or your vendor believes individual items require a judgment call, 
please feel free to check in with us on any specific questions. 
Regarding loose, unlabeled discs, we are not requesting their production at this time. If there are discs that are labeled in 
some way that indicates or suggests they contain photos in particular, please let us know, as we likely would request 
production of those items. For discs that do not fit that description, we assume those will be retained by the estate in any 
event, but please let us know if that is incorrect, or if at some subsequent point that status is expected to change. 
Finally, I know we raised the issue of privilege for the first time on our call, so I just want to reiterate that the Government 
is in no way requesting any waiver, but rather advising you and your clients that we may at some point in the coming 
weeks seek a formal position on whether the estate intends to waive, on behalf of Jeffrey Epstein, any attorney-client 
privilege for purposes of discovery review and production in connection with United States v. Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AIN). 
Prior to the Government seeking and obtaining the estate's position on such a question, we will assume that the privilege 
remains applicable and in effect, and we will proceed with our usual practices in review and production of discovery in 
that case, including producing materials obtained in connection with the Epstein investigation following any necessary 
taint / privilege review. 
Thank you again for speaking with us, and we will continue to be in touch with any other relevant issues or questions. 
best, 
Assistant U.S. Attorney 
Southern District of New York

Subject: RE: SDNY investigation 
Jill, Kyle, 
Following up on our recent WebEx discussion, and with apologies for the slight delay, we wanted to get you a list of 
initial categories of question that we think might assist in your discussion with your client, with the goal of then doing an 
attorney proffer, or attorney summary, and discussing possible next steps. 
We note that the below questions are simply general thoughts and suggestions—some may not need to be asked at all, 
others may prompt follow-up from you in the moment, etc. In any interviews with us, we ordinarily are guided both by 
the comfort level and the narrative of the witness, but we hope these give you a sense of what we would be interested 
in. We also note that we included questions about sexual contact because it is our very general understanding from you 
that abuse occurred, but we do not make any presumptions about what happened, if anything, separate from what your 
client recalls. On that note, as we've discussed, but to reiterate, if there are any questions or topics your client is 
uncomfortable addressing, there will be no pressure from us to do so, including at this early stage. 
With those caveats, possible questions are below, and please let us know if it would be useful for us to chat again before 
you talk with your client, or otherwise please let us know when it would next be appropriate to check in. 
Questions / topics: 
1) General background queries: Where did you grow up? How far did you go in school? What is your date of birth? 
How generally would you describe your upbringing and early professional life? 
2) How did you initially meet Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein, and how old were you at that time? What was the 
nature of your work with them, and did the role change over time? How long did you work for Maxwell and/or 
Epstein? 
3) In general, what kinds of tasks did you perform for Maxwell or Epstein, and in what locations? Did you travel with 
either of them? When you weren't traveling with them, where did you reside? Did you ever reside with Maxwell or 
Epstein? If so, where — in what locations and at which properties? 
4) Did there come a time when Epstein and/or Maxwell engaged in sexual contact with you? If so, how did that 
happen the first time? Were there sexualized discussions or was there sexualized conduct leading up to any first 
incident? 
5) Were there other instances when you experienced sexual abuse or sexual contact while working for Maxwell? If so, 
how did those incidents occur? Did they occur with Epstein alone, or was Maxwell ever directly involved in the 
sexual contact? Did Maxwell ever observe, or was she present for, sexual contact that she herself was not 
participating in? Were any other individuals present or participating? 
6) Were you aware of any other girls or women who were subject to sexual abuse or contact by Epstein and/or 
Maxwell, and if so, who? Did you ever see Epstein or Maxwell involved in sexual or other intimate contact with 
other girls you believed or suspected may have been under the age of 18? And if so, under what circumstances 
(when, where, etc.)? 
7) How did your interactions with Epstein and Maxwell end? Did either of them contact you or attempt to contact you 
when Epstein was under investigation in 2006-08? Did either of them contact you or attempt to contact you during 
the New York investigation in 2018-20? If so, what was the nature of that contact? When is the last time you spoke 
with or otherwise interacted with Epstein and/or Maxwell? 
thank you,

Good morning Sir 
Last night a source extended dates on bike path. Epstein riding with young girl to Feb 21. 
sightings between Feb 13-21, 2019. 
One just below Royal Poinciana Bridge 
Second just below Sailfish Club Palm Beach 
Also apparently young girl wad not tall, brunette, wearing a ponytail and looked 18 give or take a f 
ew years? Could not say for certain. 
JE was wearing a baseball cap. 
It seems they were walking on bike path. 
In December a different source had spotted JE and what seemed a very young girl. 
I told 
Former PB chief of police. 
He explained cameras only keep video for 3 months. That first incident happened sometime in Nov. I wI 
as told January. 
Nothing was done to follow up. 
This is a different source and now another sighting. 
Thank you 
Good day

That's no problem, we don't need those on Relativity. Separately, though will we be able to play those video files *not* 
on a DVD? That is, we only have them in electronic format (in the file folders) — I haven't tried to play them, so maybe it's 
just as easy as that, but wanted to check if we need to get them processed in some other fashion to be able to view 
independently of a DVD player.

That's great, thanks — and Jenna is fantastic, happy to have her involved. Just to clarify, and to help with our 
scheduling, I take it we'll start with an attorney proffer? Or let me know if I misinterpreted and we're talking 
about a meeting with the client. Either one totally fine but wanted to confirm— let me know and I'll circle back 
in timing, and will also send you a copy of our standard proffer agreement so you have it for your meeting with 
her this afternoon. 
Two other quick things — first, we know your client as 
but I think you mentioned her name has 
changed? Could you please let me know her current last name? 
And second, one very helpful thing for us would be to have any phone numbers she utilized with Epstein or 
anyone associated with him at that time, and/or numbers for him or others she communicated with in connection 
with him. Primarily, that could help to corroborate and confirm her recollections, and it's something we don't 
need to talk to her directly about to get started working on. If you think it would concern her to provide that at 
this stage, no problem at all, we can circle back to it later, but wanted to mention it. 
thanks,

Barr Seized on Epstein Case as Doubts Mounted About Justice Dept. 
NYT 
By Katie Benner 
8/23/19 
Attorney General William P. Barr was at home in his study, working on a speech, when the call came from his chief 
of staff: Jeffrey Epstein, the financier accused of sex trafficking who had connections to an array of political power 
players, had died in federal prison. 
Mr. Barr immediately knew that he would be engulfed in a scandal. The prison had promised to keep Mr. Epstein 
under constant surveillance until he could be tried on charges of sexually abusing dozens of underage girls. With his 
accusers now robbed of their day in court, the Justice Department, which oversees the Bureau of Prisons, looked 
incompetent at best. And as Mr. Barr scrambled for answers, unfounded conspiracy theories took root, casting an 
additional pall over the matter and threatening the public's faith in the department. 
Over multiple briefings an hour, Mr. Barr spent that Saturday angrily grilling his deputies. He directed the F.B.I. to 
investigate Mr. Epstein's apparent suicide and the department's inspector general to look for lapses in protocol. After 
the Bureau of Prisons confirmed the death and the F.B.I. inquiry that morning, Mr. Barr issued a statement, 
surprising officials who believed the bureau would have the last word. "Mr. Epstein's death:' he said, "raises serious 
questions that must be answered?' 
Attorneys general rarely follow up on inmate deaths, but Mr. Barr has continued to bird dog the investigation into 
how one as high-profile as Mr. Epstein could have died in federal care, evidence of how serious the matter is for the 
Justice Department. This account of his search for answers is based on interviews with six people involved in the 
investigation into Mr. Epstein's death, most of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal 
department discussions. 
Mr. Barr is personally overseeing the four federal inquiries into the matter and is briefed on them multiple times a 
day. In less than two weeks, he suspended the two prison employees who guarded Mr. Epstein the night he died, 
transferred the warden and found a new permanent director for the Bureau of Prisons. He stayed apprised of the 
autopsy and was alerted that the coroner would officially rule the death a suicide. And federal prosecutors in New 
York have subpoenaed more than a dozen prison officials and employees as the fast-moving investigation into Mr. 
Epstein's death intensifies. 
That a tabloid-ready scandal could present any danger to Mr. Barr, one of the most politically shrewd and influential 
Trump cabinet members, speaks to the swirl of unresolved questions surrounding Mr. Epstein's short time in prison 
and the intense public interest in the case, itself fueled by how poorly the department handled an earlier sex 
trafficking investigation into Mr. Epstein and by the conspiracy theories about the financier's powerful acquaintances, 
including President Trump and former President Bill Clinton, that festered even before he died. 
EFTA00020787
--- PAGE 2 ---
"Bill's skill set is to doggedly get to the bottom of facts and makes decisions based on them," said Paul T. Cappuccio, 
a key adviser to Mr. Barr when he first served as attorney general under President George Bush. "For anyone to try 
to draw anything more political or conspiratorial from this situation seems unfounded." 
Mr. Barr's close handling of the case also underscores the toll that a nearly three-year war on the Justice 
Department's credibility — waged chiefly by Mr. Trump when he attacked the Russia investigation — has taken. Mr. 
Barr has publicly defended the coroner's ruling of suicide, even as some of the public and Mr. Epstein's own lawyers 
reject it. And in the wake of Mr. Epstein's death, the president amplified a baseless conspiracy theory that his 
political enemies were involved. 
"Public confidence in the independence and integrity of high-profile federal criminal investigations is giving way to 
wild-eyed conspiracy theories propagated by the president himself," said Christopher Hunter, a fellow at the Atlantic 
Council and former F.B.I. agent and prosecutor who served in the Obama and Bush administrations. 
Before Mr. Epstein died, Mr. Barr seemed to have put his greatest initial challenge as attorney general behind him. 
He had delivered the Mueller report on Russia to the public, one of the most politically divisive Justice Department 
investigations since Watergate. Accusations that he misrepresented the findings to benefit Mr. Trump had begun to 
fade from the public consciousness, and much of official Washington had moved on to new outrages and concerns. 
Mr. Epstein's death prompted an unexpected challenge to Mr. Barr's credibility. The Justice Department has faced 
accusations that it mishandled an earlier investigation into the financier by making a deal in 2008 that allowed Mr. 
Epstein to elude federal charges and serve prison time from his office. It also shielded his six known co-conspirators. 
That deal led to the resignation last month of the labor secretary, R. Alexander Acosta, who had brokered the 
agreement while serving as United States attorney in Miami. 
To quell renewed furor over the deal, the Justice Department opened an internal review. Prosecutors in Manhattan 
had also opened a new sex trafficking investigation, but Mr. Epstein's connections with powerful figures all over the 
world prompted skepticism that charges would ever be filed. Even Mr. Barr had chance ties to Mr. Epstein: His old 
law firm, Kirkland & Ellis, had worked with Mr. Epstein on the Miami deal, and decades earlier, Mr. Barr's father had 
hired Mr. Epstein to teach at Dalton, the elite private school in Manhattan. 
But in July, Manhattan prosecutors charged Mr. Epstein with sex trafficking, putting the financier behind bars while 
he awaited trial. Thirty-three days later, Mr. Epstein, 66, was found dead in his cell. 
From the moment he learned that Mr. Epstein had killed himself, Mr. Barr has been largely consumed by the inner 
workings of the prison where Mr. Epstein was housed, the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan. 
Mr. Barr knew that Mr. Epstein — a high-profile and politically connected prisoner — could pose a problem, 
especially after he was found unconscious in his cell last month in a possible suicide attempt But within a week, 
prison officials determined that he could be taken off suicide watch, and they assured the Justice Department that he 
would be monitored around the clock and be placed with a cellmate, whose presence could deter self-harm. 
It is not clear whether "appropriate oversight from Justice Department leadership was brought to bear before 
Epstein committed suicide to make sure that the Bureau of Prisons was meeting its responsibilities," said David 
Laufman, a former Justice Department official. 
"The attorney general or the deputy attorney general's office should have communicated directly and forcefully with 
bureau leadership to ensure that it was dedicating maximum resources and oversight to prevent Epstein from doing 
harm to himself," Mr. Laufman said. 
After Mr. Epstein killed himself, Mr. Barr moved to quell doubt that the department would seek justice. 
He immediately determined that prison employees and the warden had broken protocol several times. Mr. Epstein's 
cellmate had been removed. The employees overseeing him had stopped their regular checks into his cell the night he 
EFTA00020788
--- PAGE 3 ---
died, even though prison supervisors and officials knew that he was to be constantly watched. And the prison had 
yet to officially determine whether he had earlier tried to commit suicide. 
Mr. Barr put on leave the two employees who were responsible for watching over Mr. Epstein the night he died and 
moved the warden, Lamine N'Diaye. And when he asked Kathleen Hawk Sawyer last Friday to return to run the 
Bureau of Prisons — a job he had appointed her to in 1992, during his first stint as attorney general — she was 
impressed by the amount of detail he had gathered about Mr. Epstein's death and the conditions at the prison where 
he died, according to a person with knowledge of the conversation who was not authorized to share details. 
Ms. Sawyer told Mr. Barr that she took the job in large part because she believed she would have Mr. Barr's support 
to make difficult decisions necessary to address the Epstein case and the bureau's continuing struggles with staff and 
funding shortages, prison violence and workplace discrimination issues at its 120 facilities, according to the person. 
Mr. Barr has not shied away from publicly commenting on the Epstein case. Two days after the suicide, Mr. Barr said 
that "serious irregularities at this facility" demanded "accountability," and that the Justice Department would pursue 
Mr. Epstein's co-conspirators. 
On Wednesday, Mr. Barr defended the coroner's report, saying that he had seen nothing to contradict it. And he said 
that the department could soon "report to Congress" a fuller picture of those irregularities and that the results had 
been delayed by witnesses who would not speak without union and legal representatives. 
Mr. Barr unfairly painted the jail employees as uncooperative, said Eric Young, the president of the union that 
represents federal prison workers, adding that the department has refused to grant immunity to workers involved in 
the Epstein inquiry, which he said was typical in similar federal investigations. 
But even as Mr. Barr closes in on a definitive account of the failings that led to Mr. Epstein's suicide, questions 
remain. The Bureau of Prisons has not yet said whether security cameras in the cell block showed anyone entering 
and leaving Mr. Epstein's cell in the hours before he died. And it is still not clear why the prison broke promises to 
regularly check on Mr. Epstein and keep him with a cellmate.

(Here's the latest reference to him: "Just three months ago, as federal prosecutors were closing in with new 
charges, Mr. Epstein had a conversation with R. Couri Hay, a publicist, about continuing to improve his 
reputation. Mr. Epstein asserted that what he was convicted of did not constitute pedophilia, said Mr. Hay, 
who declined to represent him. The girls he had sex with were "tweens and teens," Mr. Epstein told him.")

Totally understand it's voluminous, but we do to need to move it because otherwise our searching process will be all 
messed up — we won't be able to run terms through all search warrant returns (instead, we'd have to duplicate literally 
every search across two different huge folders). And it doesn't work to just search all materials in the entire file because 
the FBI case file is also huge. 
If going forward there is any question at all on where things should go in the folder structure, we're more than happy to 
provide guidance on that.

appear to be any distinction between all of those folders so I don't think there's any utility in having so many subgroups. 
But let us know if (2) is a problem and happy to discuss.

just tried calling but didn't catch you — I don't see where these are located in Relativity? I think they should be 
under "Search Warrant Returns" but I don't see them there (or anywhere else under the Epstein overall folder). Let me 
know if I've just missed them, which is entirely possible, or if they're not accessible to us yet? Thank you!

We've received a hard drive from FBI CART, which they've processed from devices seized and searched in connection 
with the Epstein case. Can we please get those materials uploaded to Relativity, for privilege review by

Re: 
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) 
Dear Counsel: 
You requested a copy of the spreadsheets on the hard drives you have reviewed at the FBI 
office in Denver. Those spreadsheets are embedded with hyperlinks to the images on the hard 
drives. The Government is not able to provide you with copies of the versions of the spreadsheets 
on the hard drives because those spreadsheets are embedded with photographs depicting, among 
other things, child exploitation materials. However, the FBI has prepared a version of the 
spreadsheets you requested without the embedded photographs, which we are producing to you 
today, as listed in the below index. These materials are stamped with control numbers 
SDNY GM 02765031 through SDNY GM 02765061. 
Please note that both this letter and the enclosed materials are governed by the July 31, 
2020 Protective Order in this case. This letter is itself designated as "confidential," because it 
includes information regarding records designated as "confidential" under the Protective 
Order. The Department of Justice directed this office to cease the dissemination of materials 
marked with the word "confidential" in order to avoid potential confusion with markings reserved 
for classified documents. Accordingly, in order to note the appropriate designation of this 
production under the operative Protective Order in this case, the materials being produced today 
are marked with the following label: "SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDER PARAGRAPHS 7, 
EFTA00020815
--- PAGE 2 ---
Page 2 
8, 9, 10, 15, and 17." This marking directly refers to the specific paragraphs of the Protective 
Order that govern today's production. 
An index of the materials contained in this production is below: 
Bates Start

Confidential Designation 
SDNY GM 02765031 SDNY GM 02765061

Subject: RE: US v. Maxwell - Request for Extension of Discovery Deadline 
Good afternoon, 
( 
Thank you for your response. The outside vendor is PAE, which maintains our office's Relativity database. The production 
at issue consists of documents extracted from numerous electronic devices seized from Jeffrey Epstein's residences in 
New York and the Virgin Islands, which were loaded onto Relativity for privilege and responsiveness review. On October 
7, 2020, our office's filter team completed its privilege review of those documents. On October 21, 2020, the case team 
completed the responsiveness review and identified approximately 1.2 million documents as responsive. That same 
night, the case team asked PAE to prepare those approximately 1.2 million documents for production by imaging, bates 
stamping, and downloading the documents. We have repeatedly told PAE of the November 9th discovery deadline. 
Yesterday, PAE informed us that it had finished imaging the production but would not be technologically able to finish 
bates stamping and downloading the production by November 9th. PAE has indicated that it expects to complete the 
production by November 19th, though it is making every effort to move as quickly as possible. 
Best, 
Assistant United States Attorney

Dear Ms. 
Because of ongoing difficulty with client calls and visitation we have not been able to adequately discuss the request. Also, 
it would be helpful for us to know the reason for the anticipated delay and the identity of the vendor. 
Once we have had the opportunity to fully consider the request we will let you know our position.

Subject: US v. Maxwell - Request for Extension of Discovery Deadline 
Counsel, 
Today our outside vendor informed us that it will not be technologically possible for the vendor to finish processing the 
Government's final discovery production in this case by the November 9, 2020 deadline. The vendor has indicated that it 
expects to finish processing the production by November 19, 2020, at which point it will send the production to 1 St. 
Andrew's Plaza for us to conduct a spot check before providing it to you. Accordingly, we intend to ask the Court to 
extend the final discovery deadline, solely for the production of materials being processed by the vendor, by two weeks to 
November 23, 2020. We still expect to make a separate discovery production to you on November 9, 2020, and the only 
material that will be the subject of this extension request is that being processed by the vendor. 
Would you please let us know your position on this extension request? We are also happy to have a phone call to discuss. 
Best, 
Assistant United States Attorney 
Southern District of New York

Glen, 
We will be joined by two FBI agents who are focusing on the CBP topics that we have previously discussed. I expect one 
of those agents will take the lead on questioning Mr. 
The topics we expect to cover include: 
• The identities of any CBP employees Mr. 
recalls interacting with Jeffrey Epstein in the Virgin Islands. 
• Any steps Mr. 
recalls any CBP employees in the Virgin Islands taking to help Epstein and those traveling with 
Epstein to enter the country, including any steps that allowed Epstein or those traveling with him to avoid 
processing that travelers would normally undergo. 
• Any favors Mr. 
recalls Epstein doing for CBP employees in the Virgin Islands, such as trips to Epstein's island.

Thanks very much, Glen. Let's plan for 1pm on Thursday, 11/12. I will circulate a WebEx invitation shortly. 
We expect to ask Mr. 
about his interactions with 
the U.S. Customs and Border Protection 
employee who worked in Saint Thomas and who had Mr. 
listed as a contact in his phone. I expect we will ask for 
an approximate timeline of when Mr. 
met and interacted with 
the nature of those interactions, and any 
interactions 
may have had with Epstein (to the best of Mr. 
knowledge).

Sorry for the delay. Looks like we can do between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. on Tuesday, 11/10, or any time on Thursday, 11/12. 
Let us know if anything in that range will work. 
So as to make sure Mr.

That works for us, thanks very much — we'll plan for 2:00 on the 4th. 
And the street address is 1 St. Andrews Plaza, though for purposes of using Google Maps, it's often easier to get 
directions to 5 Centre Street — if you let her know the building is through an archway and just to the left of a 
very large outdoor red sculpture. And of course she should feel free to calm us if she needs any assistance with 
directions or transportation.

Totally understand it's voluminous, but we do to need to move it because otherwise our searching process will be all 
messed up — we won't be able to run terms through all search warrant returns (instead, we'd have to duplicate literally 
every search across two different huge folders). And it doesn't work to just search all materials in the entire file because 
the FBI case file is also huge. 
If going forward there is any question at all on where things should go in the folder structure, we're more than happy to 
provide guidance on that.

grateful — and we'll plan to get it to 
asap once we have access.

Subject: RE: Epstein search materials for upload and privilege review 
We've received a hard drive from FBI CART, which they've processed from devices seized and searched in connection 
with the Epstein case. Can we please get those materials uploaded to Relativity, for privilege review by 
(copied 
here)? I've left the hard drive with the materials on your chair. (And if we could please get that hard drive back once 
the materials are uploaded, the FBI has another batch they want to transmit to us for the same process, so that will 
also be coming shortly.) 
And then M, these will be subject to just the exact same privilege review you previously ran in connection with 
Epstein search warrant returns. 
Please let us know if any questions or issues at all? And thanks very much as always.

this is depressing but extremely helpful, thank you — I've drafted up an email to

Subject: US v. Epstein 
HelloM 
The new data set you gave to me from the FBI has some problems and I was wondering if we can get the FBI to fix some of 
these issues. Here are the problems: 
1. 
The data they sent to us has no way to put any e-mails or attachments together so if we were processing the data 
we have no way to link anything together. 
2. 
The load file has no link to the native file which means that when we load the data to the database we have no 
way to have the native files show up in the database 
3. 
The control numbers in the load file do not match those of the native files. Which means we have two sets of 
numbers and no way to match up anything. 
If we can get the FBI to either send us the data again with these corrections applied that would be great. Please let me 
know if there are any questions. 
Thank you.

Jeff and George, 
Thank you both very much for your assistance in response to our subpoenas seeking records from Interlochen. In 
reviewing the documents you produced in response to the attached subpoena, a follow-up question arose. Would you 
please confirm that your production included all records of any tuition payments that Epstein (or his entities) made for 
any students at Interlochen? 
Our team is also happy to discuss this inquiry over the phone if that would be useful. I am starting a trial tomorrow and 
will have limited availability this week, but my colleagues 
and 
(both cc'd) should be able to 
coordinate with you as needed.

Glen, 
We will be joined by two FBI agents who are focusing on the CBP topics that we have previously discussed. I expect one 
of those agents will take the lead on questioning Mr. 
The topics we expect to cover include: 
• The identities of any CBP employees Mr. 
recalls interacting with Jeffrey Epstein in the Virgin Islands. 
• Any steps Mr. 
recalls any CBP employees in the Virgin Islands taking to help Epstein and those traveling with 
Epstein to enter the country, including any steps that allowed Epstein or those traveling with him to avoid 
processing that travelers would normally undergo. 
• Any favors Mr. 
recalls Epstein doing for CBP employees in the Virgin Islands, such as trips to Epstein's island.

Thanks very much, Glen. Let's plan for 1pm on Thursday, 11/12. I will circulate a WebEx invitation shortly. 
(USANYS) 
We expect to ask Mr. 
about his interactions with 
the U.S. Customs and Border Protection 
employee who worked in Saint Thomas and who had Mr. 
listed as a contact in his phone. I expect we will ask for 
an approximate timeline of when Mr. 
met and interacted with 
the nature of those interactions, and any 
interactions 
may have had with Epstein (to the best of Mr. 
knowledge).

Attached are both cover letters. I also overlooked the most recent JPMorgan production that we received: 
Luckily, it's much smaller than the previous productions we've received and can thus be re-stamped manually. Let me 
know if you'd like me to do so for this production.

Hi all, 
All the materials have been stamped and are ready to go. A big shout out to

project. We went ahead and stamped the twc 
productions that are not password locked. The other two 
we still have to figure out how to open. I've been in contact withMIM.vho has one of the productions that we 
need. The first files he sent over were corrupted; I'm hoping that the second time is the charm.

Hey 
I believe whaaeant 
was that we would still be producing everything in the folder but would only stamp select 
files; in doing so we'd be avoiding the filler and supporting files which don't contain any viewable data.. My thinking is 
that we stamp only the folders and leave the files as they are since the structure and contents of the folder are already 
confusing as is. On something like this, defense will be leaning entirely on the manual that is included for viewing. I fear 
that if we were to alter file names it would greatly complicate the process of figuring out how to work the files.

Thanks very much for working through this. My preference is to produce everything where possible. Is it possible to 
produce the entirety of the files and app related to LSJ Scene2Go? We are trying to produce everything we can.

Subject: Fourth Production - Scene2Go 
Hi all, 
I'm bates stamping files within the Fourth Production folder, and one of the items we're going to produce is called "LSJ 
Scene2Go." From what I gather, this is an application for viewing 3D maps — in this case, there's a 3D view of the grotto 
and the main structure. When not viewed in the Scene2Go app itself, you can view screenshots of the 3D maps, and I'm 
assuming these images are what we want to produce. 
For our reference 
h files .ertainin: to the !rotto I 
. nd those pertaining
ucture ( 
In each location, 
the "map" and "scans" folders contain the viewable files. Within the map folder is an aerial view, and within the scans 
folder are essentially screenshots of the 3D view of the landscapes. Each view is saved 7 different times, each increasing in 
size. For the sake of easy review, I think that only the largest (and highest quality) images should be stamped, instead of 
stamping every duplicate. 
This looks similar to the issues we faced with the Second Production, as the vast majority of files within the larger 
Scene2Go folder are system- or application-generated files that simply accompany the files (in this case, scans and maps 
of the grotto and the main structure) that are actually viewable and of interest. I'm thinking it would be best to just stamp 
these viewable files, along with the Scene2Go user manual (for context), but of course I wanted to run this by you all first. 
I'll defer to your better judgement I 
I'm happy to talk this over further as well — thank you so muchl

I'm actually very surprised. If you still wanted to chat and share what exactly you're looking 
for, I'd be happy to recommend someone who might be a better fit. 
With that being said, I just testified earlier this week in a Daubert Hearing for Federal Prosecutor 
 . I'm sure that you might find the hearing transcript of interest at a minimum, and it 
sheds light in the content of my testimony. Similarly, the trial transcript for this case, where I testified for the

Thanks for following up on this. If it's okay with you, I think it makes sense to connect you with the plaintiff's attorney, 
Jack Scarola, so that he can convey this to you directly. I have spoken with him and explained the context here, and he 
has told me that he would be happy to speak with you. He is also seeking a copy of the transcript, as he has informed me

We haven't found a governing protective order, but to be safe, would you be able to get a letter or email fro 
attorney stating that they are not aware of a protective order/agreement governing the disclosure of the transcript, an 
to the extent one existed, they are waiving any provisions in order to permit the Estate to provide the transcript to the US 
Attorney's Office, and that they will not claim, in any forum, that the Co-Executors, the Estate, or any representatives of

Regardless, the response included everything that Interlochen has. They only keep tuition payment information for 7

Jeff and George, 
Thank you both very much for your assistance in response to our subpoenas seeking records from Interlochen. In 
reviewing the documents you produced in response to the attached subpoena, a follow-up question arose. Would you 
please confirm that your production included all records of any tuition payments that Epstein (or his entities) made for 
any students at Interlochen? 
Our team is also happy to discuss this inquiry over the phone if that would be useful. I am starting a trial tomorrow and 
will have limited availability this week, but my colleagues 
and 
(both cc'd) should be able to 
coordinate with you as needed.

Hi =,

I hope you're doing well. Because of some discovery accessibility issues we're having in the Ghislaine Maxwell case, 
we would like to provide a clean laptop to Maxwell in MDC for discovery review purposes. The laptop need only 
permit review of standard files — word, pdf, .tif, .xls, etc. All other capabilities and programs can be disabled. I 
understand we did something similar in the Avenatti case, and we'd like to do the same here. Would that be 
possible? It would be a huge help to us if you could possibly prep and provide us with a laptop for this purpose. 
Thanks so much—

Hello 
and =, 
During our call you explained that you were actively trying to investigate crimes in France by Jean Luc Brunel and had 
reached out to certain government officials in the US to try to coordinate your efforts but had not received any 
substantive communication or assistance. I explained that there is a great team of prosecutors in New York who have 
been actively working on this investigation. Per our call I am copying above 
M. 
As I explained, I am not sure if they can directly be of help to you but they will likely have a better sense of who 
within the US government you can be coordinating with. 
I hope this is helpful and thank you for your pursuit of justice in France.

Good afternoon, 
Amazon's response to the attached grand jury subpoena is overdue by several weeks. The FBI has emailed and left 
messages with your legal department several times over the past weeks without a response. 
Please respond promptly to resolve Amazon's non-compliance. Otherwise we will initiate contempt proceedings 
regarding your failure to comply with valid legal process.

Emne: Epstein case 
De.= 
I'm an investigative reporter at The Norwegian Business Daily in Oslo, (Dagens Nxringsliv). We have been 
writing about Jeffrey Epstein's political connections for a year, among them revealing how he managed to get 
Bill Gates through the doors of the Nobel Peace Prize committee's leader in 2013. But our main target has been 
the former UN assistant Secretary General, Mr. Terje Rod-Larsen, who resigned as president of the International 
Peace Institute in New York, after we revealed his financial dealings with Epstein. I'm attaching our translated 
articles. 
The reason why I'm writing to You is that I see You were on the team at SDNY prosecuting him. And I've heard 
that You reached out to some of the people who were on Epstein's flight log in recent years. I would be grateful 
if we could exchange background information that might help us in our further investigation. We have reason to 
believe that both Mr. Rod-Larsen and his wife Mona Juul were on his plane one time during Christmas to 
Epstein's island in the years 2010-2015. 
I'm sorry for reaching out to You on this email, but I couldn't find one at the SDNY website.

Thanks very much for being in touch, and we appreciate Mr. 
continued willingness to speak with us if and when 
that would be useful. At the moment, we don't immediately need to speak with him, and we certainly will contact you 
anytime that changes. We're currently working our way through a number of interviews and investigative steps on the

Subject: Epstein --
Dear 
and 
I represent 
a potential witness in your
 case. As you will recall, we spoke about Mr. 
back in March, when you reached out to see if Mr. 
would speak to you and we agreed that you could. 
Although you have not contacted Mr. = 
I thought you should know about some recent developments. 
For the last week or so the New York Times (Mike McIntire) has been aggressively reaching out to Mr. =, 
Jesse Rose this employment lawyer) and me (who represented him in the Maxwell case) by email and hone, as 
well comiaiMr. 
home twice. He is seeking our comments and information concerning the 
and Mr. 
testimony in the Maxwell case. 
According to McIntire, the Times is planning to run story on the 
and their ties to Epstein. It also appears 
that the Times has a copy of all or a portion of the deposition Mr. 
gave in the Maxwell case, which is 
troubling because it was subject to confidentiality in that case and, although the Second Circuit has ordered the 
unsealing of the summary judgment papers (which likely include references to Mr. 
deposition 
testimony), no mandate has issued or documents been unsealed. 
In addition, the Times tells us that a "representative" of the 
has told it that Mr. 
"lied" in his 
deposition. If a representative did that, it is both defamatory and breaches a non-disparagement provision in the

Thanks very much for sending —the plea transcript was filed publicly in the CVRA litigation so we were aware of it, but as 
you say, better to learn something twice than to miss it entirely, so we appreciate it. 
As always, please let us know if any additional clients of yours would be willing to speak with us at any stage — and feel 
free to connect them with us directly, rather than going through the FBI number, if that's easier.

Subject: Epstein 
As we know, Epstein's Lawyers are going to claim that the NPR agreement prohibits your prosecution. I want to 
share some information with you regarding that issue. You are probably already aware of this, but I'd prefer that 
you learn about it twice instead of never being aware of this proof. At the state court plea hearing, Epstein's 
counsel told the court that the NPR covered only the So Dist Of Fla. On the next page of the transcript the Judge 
messes it up a bit, but we know that when she said "they", she meant the USAO of the So Dist of Fla, NOT the 
DOJ. I am forwarding to you the cover sheet and two relevant pages of the transcript. along with info re when 
and where his occurEd. If you have any questions about this, or any other way I can assist, 
you please call me PS - two of my clients have advised me that they have contacted the FBI.

My colleagues 
and I are the team of prosecutors working on the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, and 
we wondered if we might be able to set up a call with you for sometime this week, to ask you some logistical questions 
we're hoping you might either be able to answer or to point us in the right direction on. Would that be possible? If 
there are a few times in the coming days that you're free, we can try to figure out a slot that works for everyone. 
Thanks very much, and looking forward to being in touch.

Chris, 
Our paralegals reminded me that we have produced the ranges you included in your most recent email twice: once in the 
third production (08-21-2020) and once in the reproduction with shortened file names (09-03-2020). We can certainly 
produce them a third time, but we would not be able to reproduce them again through your FTP link, as they are too 
large. Please provide us with a 64 GB drive if you would like us to reproduce those ranges.

Thanks for the follow-up. Please send the documents to the FTP link below:

SDNY_GM_00168488 through SDNY_GM_00169165

We had discussed these ranges several months ago and I believe you had agreed to reproduce them in the 11/9

Following up on point 6 below, our paralegals have re-stamped the materials you identified with a Bates range overlap 
and are prepared to reproduce those materials to you. The materials are small enough to produce via your FTP site. 
Would you like to send us a link to where you would like those materials uploaded? Alternatively, we can load the 
materials to a CD and send it to you. 
We are still waiting to hear back from our vendor about the remaining issues you identified in point 6.

Subject: RE: Discovery Requests 
Chris, 
Below please find our responses. 
1. As we have recently discussed, Ms. Maxwell now has access to the 4TB drive containing a full set of the discovery 
produced to date. It took a significant amount of time to create this copy due to the volume of discovery and 
delays on the part of our vendor, who assisted in creating the copy. 
2. As we have recently discussed, Ms. Maxwell now has a drive containing the contents of the CD produced on 
November 18, 2020. 
3. As I conveyed to you over the phone and in a recent email, the materials produced from the Subject Devices all 
contain metadata indicating the "NYC" CART Evidence Number of the device from which each document was 
extracted. In our November 18, 2020 discovery letter, we provided you with a chart setting forth which "NYC" 
CART Evidence Number corresponds with which Subject Device in our warrants. If you still need a detailed index 
of all 1.2 million documents with the specific Subject Device indicated, please let me know, and I will ask one of 
our paralegals to compile one. 
4. We produced the FBI report bearing Bates number SDNY_GM_02050812-14 in the form in which it was recovered 
from one of Epstein's devices. In other words, we did not apply any redactions to that document; rather, the 
redactions existed on the document at the time the document was found during the FBI's search of Epstein's 
devices. We are not aware of any legal basis for your request for a log of redactions. If you have any legal 
authority on that point, we would be happy to consider it. As a courtesy, I will note that our office did not apply 
redactions to any material that was identified responsive during the searches of Epstein's devices. 
5. We are aware of our discovery obligations, have complied with them, and will continue to comply with them. We 
are not aware of any legal basis for your request that we inform you of what, if any, documents have been 
withheld or the basis for their withholding. If you have any legal authority on that point, we would be happy to 
consider it. As a courtesy, I will note that we have provided you with all records we received from AT&T and all 
records we received from David Rodgers. As to your inquiry about the Bates ranges on the Rodgers documents 
beginning with Bates number "28", I note that the folder containing the Rodgers subpoena returns in our August 
5, 2020 production included two documents. The first (SDNY_GM_00005532-5649) is the document you 
referenced in your email inquiry. The second (SDNY_GM_00005650-5676) is 27 pages long, accounting for the 
first 27 pages of the production from Rodgers. We produced those two documents in the form in which we 
received them. 
6. Our paralegals are working on the issues you identified with Bates ranges and metadata load files. I will reach back 
out to you once I have an update on the status of those issues. 
7. We do not have a more detailed index of the November 9 and November 18 productions beyond what we have 
provided to you. 
8. We are not aware of any legal basis for your request for copies of grand jury subpoenas. Nor are we aware of any 
legal basis for your request that we identify the date range of documents we requested in each subpoena. If you 
have any legal authority for those requests, we would be happy to consider it. 
9. The court filings that appear to be referenced in the Daily Beast article you sent are an application for a search 
warrant and a search warrant filed in the District of New Hampshire. We produced both documents to you in 
discovery on August 5, 2020. The DNH judge issued a sealing order in connection with the warrant and 
application. As you can see at Bates No. SDNY_GM_00000621, the sealing order automatically expired on 
EFTA00020980
--- PAGE 4 ---
December 30, 2020. Our understanding is that the District of New Hampshire unsealed the filing of its own accord 
in conformity with the clear language of that sealing order. Our office took no affirmative steps to unseal or 
otherwise release these filings.

Subject: Discovery Requests 
We write to raise a number of discovery issues. Please let us know your position on these issues at your earliest 
convenience. 
1. In our email correspondence on 11/18/2020, you agreed to create a new hard drive containing the entire discovery 
production. We provided you with a 4TB hard drive for that purpose on 11/20/2020. It is very important for Ms. 
Maxwell to have this drive as soon as possible to prepare her defense. Do you have an update on when the drive 
will be ready? 
2. We also informed you that the CD produced on November 18, 2020 did not work on the prison computer at the 
MDC (as you know, the laptop provided to Ms. Maxwell does not have a CD drive). Accordingly, we asked you to 
include the material on the CD in the new 4TB hard drive. We followed-up with you about this issue on December 
30, 2020. Given that the new hard drive is still not ready, we ask that you download the material on the CD onto 
a separate thumb drive or hard drive and provide it as quickly as possible to Ms. Maxwell at the MDC so that she 
can review the materials this weekend. Alternatively, you can provide an external CD drive to Ms. Maxwell at the 
MDC so that she can read the files on the MDC computer. We will provide whatever media device you require to 
facilitate this production. 
3. Unlike the November 9, 2020 discovery cover letter, the November 18, 2020 discovery cover letter (attached) does 
not correlate the Bates numbers to the particular "Subject Device" from which the documents were recovered. 
Instead, the cover letter indicates that the documents came from "SDNY_PROD015" or "SDNY_PROD016." We do 
not know what those terms refer to. We request that the government produce a list that correlates the Bates 
numbers for all of the documents in SDNY_PROD015 and SDNY_PROD016 to the particular devices from which the 
documents were recovered. 
4. We request that the government provide an unredacted version of the FBI report, dated December 6, 2006, 
bearing Bates number SDNY_GM_02050812-14 (attached). We also request that the government produce a log 
identifying all of the redacted documents in the discovery and the bases for each of the redactions. 
5. There are a few documents that seem to be missing from the discovery. For example, the AT&T documents 
(SDNY_GM_00001015-3637) do not seem to include subscriber information for the various phone numbers. Also, 
the flight logs produced by David Rodgers begin at Bates number "Rodgers000028," suggesting that 
Rodgers000001-000027 were not produced to us. Please produce these documents to us or provide an explanation 
why you are not producing them to us. Please confirm whether there are other documents that were removed 
from the grand jury subpoena productions that we have not yet identified and the basis for their removal. 
6. There are a few Bates number/metadata issues with some of the documents: 
a. There is an overlap between the fourth and fifth document productions. The fourth production ends at 
SDNY_GM_00328863, the fifth production begins at SDNY_GM_00328070. We propose renumbering the 
range from the fifth production (i.e., renumber SDNY_GM_00328070-328863). 
EFTA00020981
--- PAGE 5 ---
b. The metadata load files (•.DAT) for PROD011 had a number of gaps which are detailed in the attached Excel 
file. We propose that you send us a new DAT file covering only the missing documents. 
c. The metadata load files (*.DAT) for PROD015 had a gap from SDNY_GM_00723971 to SDNY_GM_00723981. 
We propose that you send us a new DAT file covering only the missing documents. 
7. To the extent that the government has created an index of the documents produced on November 9 and 
November 18 that is more detailed than the production cover letters, we request that you provide a copy to the 
defense. 
8. We request that the government provide copies of the grand jury subpoenas for documents issued by the 
government in this case. Also, please identify the date range of documents you requested in each subpoena. 
There is one other issue we'd like to raise. An article in the Daily Beast on Monday referenced the search warrant affidavit 
for the cell-site simulator used to track Ms. Maxwell's cellphone before her arrest (https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-
the-fbi-tracked-down-ghislaine-maxwell-alleged-madam-of-jeffrey-epstein). The article stated that the affidavit appeared 
in a "newly unsealed court filing." I don't recall this affidavit being unsealed or referenced in anything that was filed on the 
court docket. Please confirm whether or not the government unsealed this affidavit or any other materials from the 
criminal discovery, and whether any discovery materials were released pursuant to FOIA requests.

Sorry but I don't believe this voucher is accurate, similar to the prior one. First, it appears to allocate one night of the 
hotel to the travel card, which is incorrect—the entirety of the hotel was paid on my personal card (please see attached 
email and I'm again sending the hotel invoice). Additionally, it doesn't appear to include the hotel tax of $ 70.12, which I 
also paid on my personal credit card. 
Please let me know when it's corrected and I'll review again. Thanks.

February I, 2021 
Re. United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell 
Cr. 330 (MN) 
By letter to the Court, dated January 25, 2021 (Dkt.117 at 2-3), the MDC raised objection 
to the Court's order, unopposed by the government, directing the MDC to permit Ms. Maxwell to 
use on a laptop computer on weekends and holidays. (Dkt. 116 at 2). The MDC has failed to 
state a valid or compelling reason for opposing the Court's directive. 
The MDC does not identify any valid reason why Ms. Maxwell cannot have access to the 
laptop computer on weekends and holidays. The MDC does not argue, for example, that access 
to the laptop cannot be provided because of issues related to safety or security, staffing, or (to 
quote the government) the need to "manag[e] its inmate population." Instead, in opposition to 
the Court's order, the MDC repeats its stock response: Ms. Maxwell has received significant 
amount of time to review her discovery and has more contact with counsel than any other MDC 
inmate is allotted. The MDC's fixation on the relative time Ms. Maxwell has been given to 
review discovery is totally misguided. The government has produced millions of pages of 
discovery. Ms. Maxwell has the right to review all of them in order to prepare her defense for 
trial. To do that, she needs access to the laptop for as much time as possible, including the 
weekends and holidays because the prison computers are incapable of reading the millions of 
discovery documents. Ms. Maxwell loses 10 or more hours per week due to delay in receiving 
the laptop, problems caused by the MDC computer, and inability to access the computer during 
morning and afternoon counts on the weekends. Comparing Ms. Maxwell to other inmates does 
not justify restricting her use of the laptop to review discovery. 
The MDC's proposed solution—that Ms. Maxwell can simply use the prison computer on 
the weekends and holidays to review discovery—is utterly inadequate. As Ms. Maxwell has 
pointed out on many occasions, the prison computer is incapable of reading a significant portion 
of the discovery, including but not limited to native files, Excel files, some video and audio files, 
and anything requiring Cellebrite software. The MDC concedes this fact in their letter—Ms. 
Maxwell cannot review all of her discovery on the prison computer. And using it causes a 
colossal waste of time. For example, if Ms. Maxwell locates a document on the prison computer 
EFTA00021015
--- PAGE 2 ---
LAW OFFICES OF BOB0I C. STERNHEIM 
for which she needs to review the native image, many of which are embedded in other files, she 
must write down the Bates number for that document and then wait until Monday to find the 
same document using the laptop computer so that she can review the full document. Moreover, 
the MDC computer shuts down every two hours, requiring Ms. Maxwell to reboot the computer 
and find her place in the documents to resume her review. This process can take 20-30 minutes, 
all of which is lost time. In addition, the power of central processing unit of the MDC computer 
is very slow. Uploading videos can take up to a half hour, time that cannot be used to review 
other documents. When the computer automatically shuts down, videos need to be re-opened, 
requiring Ms. Maxwell to locate the portion of the video she was viewing when the computer 
shut down. In sum, using the prison computer is a problem, not a solution. 
Ms. Maxwell's review of discovery is challenging enough on the laptop computer that 
was provided. Even with the laptop, Ms. Maxwell is unable to search, unable to print, and 
unable to tag or highlight documents for later review. She must review millions of pages of 
unwieldy documents produced in various formats (native, image, text) one page at a time—with 
no filtering or organizing—and record millions of Bates numbers and notes of her review by 
hand on the limited amount of paper she is provided. And she is not permitted to have any 
supplies to organize the voluminous legal papers. Hard drives provided by the government have 
been mishandled by MDC staff (dropped on the floor and slammed on a cart) causing them to 
become degraded and unstable and to randomly shut down. While the laptop does not solve all of 
these issues, it performs far better than the MDC computers. The time, resources and funds 
expended on problems caused by the electronic discovery and the computers is unnecessary, 
wasteful, and frustrating. The MDC is in no position - and is neither qualified nor experienced -
to challenge Ms. Maxwell's and her counsel's claim that she needs access to the laptop on the 
weekends and holidays to even hope to finish reviewing the millions of pages of documents 
produced in discovery. 
The MDC's assertion that Ms. Maxwell's access to her attorneys is a reason to deny her 
access to the laptop computer on weekend and holidays is non-sensical. One has absolutely 
nothing to do with the other. And it ignores the fact that, aside from time to review discovery or 
communicate with counsel, Ms. Maxwell is far more restricted than all other MDC inmates. 
Other inmates have unlimited time to communicate with other inmates. With exception of 
inmates detained in the SHU for disciplinary reasons, all other MDC inmates have unlimited 
time to interact with other inmates. Other than calls with family or communication with counsel, 
Ms. Maxwell has no human contact except with guards who wield power over her, overmanage 
her, and have psychologically and physically abused her. And complaints regarding 
mistreatment by guards have led to reprisals against Ms. Maxwell. 
Rather than state a valid reason for opposing the Court's directive, the MDC's opposition 
shines a klieg light on the deficiencies of its electronics and the limitations imposed on all 
inmates, most especially those detained pretrial. The restrictions placed on pretrial detainees goes 
beyond deprivation of liberty. Their ability to prepare for trial is compromised, their access to 
counsel is restricted, and their right to effective assistance of counsel is jeopardized. The 
pandemic has made the situation even more dire. Requiring pretrial detainees, including Ms. 
Maxwell, to review terabytes of electronic discovery on inadequate computers further tips an 
already unlevel playing field to the detriment of criminal defendants. 
EFTA00021016
--- PAGE 3 ---
LAW OFFICES OF 13013131 C. STERNHEIM 
There are no reasonable conditions to assure that as a pretrial detainee Ms. Maxwell will 
be as prepared for trial as a defendant on bail. Permitting Ms. Maxwell to use the laptop on 
weekends and holidays is a reasonable and minimum accommodation for the difficulties entailed 
in reviewing enormous amounts of electronic discovery, and one that imposes no burden on the 
BOP nor any security issues. The Court's order directing the MDC to permit Ms. Maxwell 
access to the computer on weekends and holidays should remain in effect. 
Very truly yours, 
gotez C. 9,444.440.

totally happy to chat, and it's exactly the same issues as we talked about on the phone a couple weeks ago when we 
first raised this -- I wonder if it makes sense to get in a room together? Otherwise it's a lot of games of telephone. 
But basically the way to think about it is, imagine if we had seized papers from approximately 100,000 filings cabinets in a 
dozen different office buildings. And then instead of keeping them organized or labeled by room, or even by office 
building, all 1.3 million documents (so far) just got dumped into one big pile — except before that, any documents that had 
multiple parts stapled together got separated. And then if any of those documents that was larger than about 100 pages 
couldn't be opened. That's what we've got, just electronically.

Unfortunately I don't think this is very helpful to us. Did you take a look at the example spreadsheet I sent on 2/24? The 
excel file you sent has descriptions that don't match up to the items listed in the search warrant returns (that we sent on 
2/23), and we don't have the 1B or CART numbers to be able to cross-reference. We also can't tell what you mean by 
"loose media" without a specific comparison to what was seized, we don't know which items you're referring to as 
EFTA00021023
--- PAGE 2 ---
"Windows machines," and we can't tell whether the entirety of any particular item has been transferred, or just partial. 
For example, it looks like we have gotten very, very few image files, which is surprising. 
We have also encountered some very significant problems in trying to review the more than 1 million documents we 
recently received: 
The data we've received has no way to put any emails and attachments together. So if an email says, "see the 
attached flight records," for example, we have no way of linking that up with the records themselves. Not only is 
that a big problem for us in review, it's going to be a huge problem for producing the documents to defense 
counsel. 
The load file has no link to the native file, so when we load the data to the database, there's no way to have the 
native files show up in the database. Because many of the files are too large to open in the viewer, it effectively 
means that there are many files that are completely invisible to us. 
Related, the control numbers in the load file don't match up to the native files. So we have two sets of numbers 
and no way to match up anything—that is, even if we were to try to go hunt down every individual large file in the 
native files, it would be impossible. 
So the data that we most recently got, we need to get in a form that addresses those issues, and we likely will need to get 
a similar reproduction of the data we received a couple months ago. Otherwise we're sifting through more than a million 
documents without much rhyme or reason. 
I've re-attached the spreadsheet we sent last week — I think that's a good place to start in terms of our necessary record-
keeping, and we need that info at the very least, as well as anything else you think would be useful. Also attaching the SW 
returns for reference. And again, we're happy to meet up anytime and hash all this out in person if that's useful. 
thanks,

clarification: There were 9 IDE hard drives found in the Manhattan apartment, they turned out to be 3 copies of 3 drives 
(9 drives in total) from a July 2007 search on one of his properties. I only processed 3 (as they were all copies). All the 
loose media from the NY apartment is included. All the Windows machines from the NY apartment are included. Only 2 
Macs from NY and 1 from the Island are included. 
I will have to more closely coordinate with whoever is loading up Relativity with the remaining Macs as the tool 
they have to be processed with does not easily re-name the load files. 
Spreadsheet is attached.

I could do Thursday morning, but I think it would be helpful for us to get the accounting in advance of the meeting so we 
can figure out in advance what (if any) additional steps we need — is that possible?

Totally understand about the network issues—we can relate. I do still think it will be helpful to all sit down together to 
have an in-person discussion, to make sure everybody is on the same page. Are folks available for that next week? And 
what I think would be most helpful to facilitate that would be a spreadsheet of each separate device referenced in the two

search warrant returns, with columns for whether we've dumped the contents, whether they've been reviewed and/or 
transferred, what portions were transferred, etc. 
Something roughly like the attached, with any other categories you think would be useful — and the info on the attached is 
mostly hypothetical, obviously, just as examples. That will help us fully understand what's been reviewed, transferred, 
and received so far, and what remains. 
(Also just on the pictures, we do want copies of those as well, please including from the discs and the devices — I think FBI 
was going to do an initial screen to make sure no CP, and since I think the answer was no, we'll need to get those to be 
able to review them as well.) 
many thanks,

Sony for the delayed response. They are tearing out our old network and giving us a new one, they mandated we 
delete old stuff (about 400 TB worth). Now that they are working on replacing the network, we can do only local 
work. I should be able to give you an accounting of what is what. I can say, off the top of my head, that all 
windows based items from the NY search have been handed over as well as all loose media. The CDs from NY 
only contained pictures, no documents. There are still some Apple items from NY that need to be produced. As 
far as the Island stuff goes, the 1st item on your spreadsheet, the "kitchen" mac has been produced. Still working 
on the rest.

Following up on the below from last weekend, I'm still not sure how we're addressing this so I thought it would make 
sense for us to all schedule a (hopefully relatively brief) meeting to all get on the same page? We didn't hear back on 
which files had previously been provided, but our tech folks did their best to differentiate, and we got access to the 
materials yesterday and its well over a million documents, and we don't have any idea what we're looking at — i.e., which 
devices the materials came from, whether it's full or partial results, how many more devices we have coming, etc. 
Based on the attached search warrant returns, it looks like from the New York mansion (the PDF) there are approximately 
devices that would have storage (computers, hard drives, thumb drives, etc.) and that's not even counting at least 60+ 
CDs. And then from the Virgin Islands (the Excel spreadsheet), at least more than 25 devices, including multiple servers / 
server racks. 
So we gotta know what we've already received, what remains, anticipated schedule, etc, and I know it's a lot of moving 
pieces on all sides so wanted to loop in everybody at once. The case team will be in California this coming week from

Tuesday through Friday, but then I think generally around the first week of March, which will hopefully be plenty of time 
to schedule a productive meeting.

I'm not sure who's the exact right person to ask this, so wanted to get everybody on one email chain about it — I have the 
hard drive that 
dropped off that has new Epstein search warrant materials, but it looks like there are also old 
materials (that I think we had previously received and uploaded??) on the hard drive, and so I'm not sure what's new. 
Just generally, and 
and I talked about this last week too, but it's basically impossible for us to keep track of what 
we're getting, and what has been completed, without some kind of identification or labeling system, along with a list of 
which devices have been extracted and downloaded. 
So for example on the hard drive currently, there are 38 folders labeled "loadFiles" through "37loadFiles" with a modified 
date of 11/14/19, which I think we may have already previously received — but I'm not sure, because we haven't gotten 
any info on which folders match up to which devices, etc. And then there's another folder titled "NYC024362" that has a 
modified date of 1/27/20, so I think that may be the materials we hadn't previously received? That folder by itself has 
more than 600,000 items. 
I don't want to give 
anything that we've already previously received and uploaded, and I can't tell from the folder or 
file names whether everything on the drive is new, or whether just additional materials were saved onto it in addition to 
what we already have. =, 
are you able to give us some guidance on this? Ultimately what we really need is a 
spreadsheet of every device, whether it's been dumped (or partially dumped), and then identifying that same info —
which device, and what materials from it — are being given to us with each data transfer. Otherwise I think 
organizationally and for review purposes it will be a total disaster for us. 
We're happy to have a meeting on this if that's helpful — and thanks everybody for the assistance.

Hi team, 
Today we need to docket our proposed redactions to our Motion to Quash (see Dkt. No. 473), we and the defense are 
required to docket our letters on the birth certificates issue (see Dkt. No. 474), and we and the defense need to docket 
our letters on GX 52 (see Dkt. No. 476). 
We already redacted the birth certificates letters. I've attached: 
• Our motion to quash, which I don't think needs any redactions 
• The remaining GX-52 letters, for which I've proposed redactions 
• A draft letter to the Court 
Would one of you three quickly take a look, and then I'll coordinate with the defense? 
Thanks

For a preview piece I am going to write about Maxwell's most prominent public accuser,

The Journal plans to run an article basically connecting Deutsche to most of Epstein's business. It doesn't seem like 
they're going to suggest that DB was complicit in anything nefarious, as far as I can tell. 
• Epstein used DB to wire the $350k payment to a victim after several Miami Herald articles. 
• Epstein moved millions through various DB accounts, some of it going through at least one Russian bank. 
• DB managers raised concerns after seeing the Miami Herald articles and actually shut down several of Epstein's 
accounts. 
• He had dozens of accounts with many beneficiaries who had authority to make disbursements, one of whom was 
Ghislaine Maxwell. Her account was named "Butterfly," or something like that. 
• He conducted hundreds of millions of dollars of business on the foreign exchange markets using DB in the last year. 
Thanks.

Wanted to quickly check the status of the below — it's only been a couple weeks, so totally understand it may not be 
complete, but hopefully we're getting close? If you could please check with the vendor and let us know, we'd be grateful 
— and we'll plan to get it to 
asap once we have access.

We've received a hard drive from FBI CART, which they've processed from devices seized and searched in connection with 
the Epstein case. Can we please get those materials uploaded to Relativity, for privilege review by 
(copied here)? I've 
left the hard drive with the materials on your chair. (And if we could please get that hard drive back once the materials 
are uploaded, the FBI has another batch they want to transmit to us for the same process, so that will also be coming 
shortly.) 
And then M, these will be subject to just the exact same privilege review you previously ran in connection with Epstein 
search warrant returns. 
Please let us know if any questions or issues at all? And thanks very much as always.

Saw the article about the email breach. Based on this other article, sounds like it might be

Based on your earlier email (attached), looks like we already have subscriber info for it, and the subpoena had a letter 
requesting preservation attached. Let me know if you had something else in mind, but sounds like this is already sorted 
out.

It's that time again... 
If you are in the "to" line of this email, you have a Project Safe Childhood case for which we need an update. Because of 
the sensitive nature of these cases, it's critical that we don't let cases linger, and, in consultation with your supervisors, we 
close cases when necessary. 
Please review the attached list, noting the most recent entry for any case under your name. Then... 
• 
If the case is uncharged, please advise me of the status of any expected charges and/or come by to discuss next 
steps. 
• 
If the case has been charged, please send me a quick email with any updates to the case status (e.g., pled, 
sentenced, on appeal) or, if the status is up to date, please confirm that no changes need to be made. 
Thanks in advance for your prompt reply to this email. (Read: Please don't make me hunt you down for updates — this will 
take approximately 5 minutes.)

please let me know if the fully refundable flight option I

also not refundable, so I'm looking into other options for that flight as well. I'll send you those options shortly.

We steer away from penalty flights in all instances. The change fees & cancellation risk is rarely ever worth it. Most 
penalty fees are $300. 
In the booking screen always scroll down and set the travel preferences for fare type preference to "unrestricted coach" 
That way the penalty fares won't even show up in your search.

Is it a requirement that our domestic flights be refundable? I knew that was true for international flights but I thought we 
could book nonrefundable flights traveling domestically?

Importance: High 
the Delta departing flight you chose leaving LGA at 9:00am, arriving in Pensacola, FL at 12:49pm is not refundable, so 
you'll need to choose another flight option. While checking out your flight options, I found a flight that will get you into 
Pensacola, FL around the same time as your preferred option that's fully refundable. The difference is that the flight 
leaves at 8:11am instead of 9:00am. I've placed the departing flight below for your review.

Apologies for the slight delay yesterday on this travel, we had a witness scheduling issue so the travel will be a day later 
than originally anticipated. The city is Pensacola, Florida, and it will be me and 
(rather than 
and 
if you could please book me on the following flights: 
Feb. 19: Delta, LGA to PNS, 9:00 a.m. (arriving 12:49 p.m.) 
Feb. 20: Delta, PNS to LGA, 4:06 p.m. (arriving 9:41 p.m.) 
And the following hotel, for the night of Feb. 19: 
- 
Hilton Garden Inn (listed in E2 as "HGI PENSACOLA AIRPORT MEDICAL") 
We will also need a conference room at the Hilton Garden Inn for February 19, starting at 5:00 p.m. for three hours (or for 
the entire day, if that's the only way they'll do it). 
Please let us know if any questions or issues, and thanks as always.

Hi, 
Which specific city will the hotel be in? 
If 
could push the travel authorizations thru to • & I today, that would be great.... As well as sending the 
conference room payment request to Nick Siu. 
Remember to take the FL tax exempt form along with you.

Similar to prior requests in connection with the Epstein investigation (2018R01618), but with an added international 
element, we'd like to please request permission for the team to travel next week for an interview near Stockholm, 
Sweden, next week on January 29th and/or 30th. We expect to be traveling, respectively, some combination of the 
27th (overnight) to the 31st, depending on when the interview ends up being scheduled, and we'll put final dates on 
our formal applications. Also similar to prior trips, we'd like to request approval to get a conference room for one of 
those days at a hotel for the interview itself. 
Also based on our discussion earlier we'll be mindful of looking for domestic (or domestic-flagged) carrier flights, as 
well as the costs of any alternatives, in looking at possible specific bookings. Thanks as always for your help and input 
on that.

Similar to prior requests in connection with the Epstein investigation (2018R01618), we'd like to please request 
permission for the team to travel next week for an interview in Los Angeles on November 14. We expect to be 
traveling, respectively, some combination of the 13th to the 15th (and no conference room necessary for this trip).

either be me and

the Epstein case. Can we please get those materials uploaded to Relativity, for privilege review by

left the hard drive with the materials on your chair. (And if we could please get that hard drive back once the materials 
are uploaded, the FBI has another batch they want to transmit to us for the same process, so that will also be coming 
shortly.) 
And then M, these will be subject to just the exact same privilege review you previously ran in connection with Epstein

sent to you in the previous email is okay and I'll continue with your booking. Note, the return flight on 2/20 you chose is 
also not refundable, so I'm looking into other options for that flight as well. I'll send you those options shortly.

We steer away from penalty flights in all instances. The change fees & cancellation risk is rarely ever worth it. Most 
penalty fees are $300. 
In the booking screen always scroll down and set the travel preferences for fare type preference to "unrestricted coach" 
That way the penalty fares won't even show up in your search.

the Delta departing flight you chose leaving LGA at 9:00am, arriving in Pensacola, FL at 12:49pm is not refundable, so 
you'll need to choose another flight option. While checking out your flight options, I found a flight that will get you into 
Pensacola, FL around the same time as your preferred option that's fully refundable. The difference is that the flight 
leaves at 8:11am instead of 9:00am. I've placed the departing flight below for your review.

Again in connection with the Epstein investigation (2018R01618), we'd like to please request permission to travel next 
week for a victim interview in Los Angeles. As of now we tentatively expect to fly down Wednesday and return no 
later than Friday (and will keep the timeframe as short as scheduling allows). The trip will be some combination of me, 
M, 
and/or 
as previously. And also same as last time, we'd like to ask permission to reserve a conference 
room at the hotel on Thursday for the interview, please. 
thanks very much,

Again in connection with the Epstein investigation, we'd like to please request permission to travel for approximately 
three days next week for meetings and interviews in West Palm Beach, Florida. As of now we tentatively expect to fly 
down Tuesday night and return on Wednesday or Thursday (and will keep the timeframe as short as scheduling 
allows). 
Unfortunately we're still trying to pin down timing for interviewing the victims, so depending on the timing it will 
either be me and 
or 
and 
but we wanted to ask for permission now either way so we weren't 
doing it super last minute after the holiday on Tuesday. And also same as last time, we'd like to ask permission to 
reserve a conference room at the hotel for the interviews, please. 
thanks very much,

No worries! No need to apologize. VNS is tricky. A notification is formatted via a template, kind of like a template in Word. 
There are certain sections where you can edit but then there are other areas where you can't because that's how it was 
made by the programmer. Hope that makes sense...

Got it, thanks. In the letters that went out, there are several edits we made that were applied to these letters, so I'm 
wondering why it is we can change some parts of the letters and not others? 
Apologies if I'm misunderstanding how the VNS system works. Thanks.

Hi 
Thanks. A few things: 
<

• 
In the case caption, please delete "defendant(s)," so that it does not read "defendant(s) Jeffrey Epstein". I'm not 
sure if that's the form language, but it looks like a typo. 
• 
Regarding the hearing information, there are several other court dates. I'll forward you the scheduling order so 
that you can add them. 
• 
Please swap out this language: 
Because of the Court's schedule, hearing dates could change on very short notice. If you plan on attending, 
you may want to call the VNS Call Center or check the website to confirm the date and time. Please note, 
there is a 24-hour delay in information transfer to the website. 
And replace it with this language: 
If you plan on attending, please call me at 917-301-6861 in case there are any last minute changes.

Subject: Corruption and Ghislaine 
Hi, 
My name is Lisa Kenney and I reside in NH. I have been reporting a group of wealthy MA 
real estate developers, nightclub and restaurant owners, along with rogue police who cater 
to them, donate for them, and seemingly offer private police services to them. 
One of the MA troopers is the brother of the nightclub owners and he's close to pedophile 
wealthy developer Wm. O'Connell. (arrested for statutory rape and cocaine trafficking) 
I have come across new information which leads me to believe the above group is tied to 
Epstein, and even Ghislaine, but definitely the million dollar homes where she lived and the 
LLC's connected to them. 
I have attached these documents on both a Google doc and PDF file for your viewing. 
I know this group, with the exception of the pedophile and nightclub owners, because I was 
married to one I divorced over twenty years ago, I dated another, and socialized with them. 
I have been compiling their corruption for over ten years and have received enormous 
amounts of abuse and crimes committed against me for doing so, and LE hasn't done one 
thing to stop them. 
But, I'm still here sending my reports on them, and they're still issuing threats. They 
frequently tell me they will continue the abuse and destruction to my property as long as I 
keep reporting them and their ties to nightclub owners, political policing, O'Connell, and 
obvious money laundering. 
This pedophile's victim was killed in a fiery crash one week before his trial was to begin, so 
he got off those charges. But the similarities between both he and Epstein are astounding, 
and I'm sure they knew him.

Hi everyone. 
Last week had some very notable achievements: 
a $678 million civil settlement with Novartis for years of paying illicit 
kickbacks; 
and also the arrest of GELANE Maxwell, a co-conspirator of Jeffrey 
Epstein. 
I cheer both of those the teams that worked so hard to bring those 
worthy cases. 
Of course, some of our most important achievements happen out of 
the spotlight, and I want to celebrate everyone who has: 
• taken on new gun cases to combat our District's recent rise in 
violence; 
• chipped in to skillfully handle the increase in FOIA litigation; and 
• diligently prepared thoughtful responses to compassionate 
release motions. 
And many thanks to all of our AUSAs, paralegals, and staff who are 
shouldering the work of the Office every day. 
We miss seeing you, but even when you are out of sight, we know we 
are lucky to have you. 
Stay safe and keep up the great work.

I ran travel for both Maxwell and Epstein between 1/1/1997 to 2/1/2000. 
After reviewing the travel details, the dates that correlate or are near the dates listed for
are listed below. These 
are listed as INBOUND records. 
Jeffrey Epstein: 
• 12/11/1999 
• 1/21/2000 
Ghislaine Maxwell 
• 6/23/1997 
• 8/6/1997 
• 7/20/1998 
• 7/24/1998 
• 12/18/1999 
• 1/21/2000 
I included 6/23/1997 and 8/6/1997 because between those dates GM traveled OUTBOUND. The same for 7/20/1998-
7/24/1998. 
I attached each individual records as well as the full travel records for 1/1/1997-2/1/2000.

FROM: 
UNITED STATES ATTORNEY 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
PHONE: 212-637-2200 
DISTRICT POC: Geoffrey S. Berman U.S. Attorney 
Phone: 
SYNOPSIS: 
The USAO-SDNY, in conjunction with FBI-NY, plans to obtain a search warrant for "Little Saint James," U.S. 
Virgin Islands, the private island residence owned by defendant Jeffrey Epstein (the "Island Residence"). We 
plan to seek the warrant this Friday, August 9 and the FBI plans to execute the warrant on Monday, August 12, 
2019. 
DESCRIPTION: 
Epstein was charged by Indictment in July 2019 with one count of sex trafficking of a minor and one count of 
conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of a minor. The charges stem from Epstein's sexual abuse of minor girls in 
Palm Beach, Florida, and New York, New York, from at least in or about 2002, through up to and including in or 
about 2005. 
Since obtaining the Indictment, we have developed information that Epstein may have committed additional 
crimes of a similar nature on the Island Residence. We also believe, based in part on evidence recovered during 
a prior search of Epstein's New York residence, that the Island Residence may contain evidence, including sexual 
photographs, of the conduct already charged. Working with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the U.S. Virgin 
Islands, we intend to submit an application for a search warrant for the Island Residence on or about August 9, 
2019. FBI-NY, in conjunction with local authorities, intends to execute the warrant on or about August 12, 2019.

Five things to watch when Bob Mueller testifies 
'The report is my testimony': Mueller would not provide Congress new information 
BYLINE 
TEXT 
BY JAMES HOHMANN 
with Joanie Greve and Mariana Alfaro 
THE BIG IDEA: Bob Mueller thought his public statement last 
month could get him out of testifying before Congress about 
his 448-page report and 22-month investigation. He thought 
wrong. 
Complying with a subpoena issued yesterday, the former special 
counsel has agreed to appear in back-to-back public hearings on 
July 17 before two House committees. Intelligence Chairman Adam 
Schiff (D-Calif.) and Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) 
needed to issue a subpoena to persuade Mueller to appear, but the 
duo pledged in a letter that they will work with him to address his 
"legitimate concerns about preserving the integrity" of his probe and 
EFTA00021202
--- PAGE 2 ---
said they will respect his desire not to discuss the "several criminal 
investigations" that he referred to other Justice Department offices, 
which are ongoing. 
Here are five things to watch for at the hearing three 
Wednesdays from now: 
What you need to know about Trump, Mueller and obstruction of justice 
1) Will Mueller say anything he hasn't said already? 
Don't count on it. 
"The report is my testimony," the former special counsel said on 
May 29. "Any testimony from this office would not go beyond our 
report. ... I would not provide information beyond that which is 
already public in any appearance before Congress." 
The 74-year-old is no novice. It seems exceptionally unlikely that 
Mueller will be baited into saying something he doesn't want to say. 
He's testified before Congress more than 50 times, including during 
high-profile hearings as FBI director after the 9/11 attacks and the 
2013 Boston Marathon bombings. The C-SPAN archive includes 
more than 140 hours of footage of him fielding questions from 
sometimes hostile lawmakers. 
"Mueller is no longer a Justice Department employee, and after the 
special counsel's office formally closed last month, he and his 
personal representatives had been negotiating directly with the 
committee. ... Those who know him well said that it was virtually 
impossible that he would ignore or reject a subpoena," per Rachael 
Bade, Matt Zapotosky and Karoun Demirjian. "Still, Mueller is 
EFTA00021203
--- PAGE 3 ---
unlikely to answer Democrats' biggest question: whether he or his 
team thought there was sufficient evidence to charge President 
Trump with obstruction, were he not president." 
He said during his brief remarks at the Justice Department that if his 
office "had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a 
crime, we would have said so," and he noted that the Constitution 
"requires a process other than the criminal justice system to 
formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing." 
On the other hand: Even if Mueller just reads directly from his 
report, it could have a huge impact. Most Americans and even many 
lawmakers have not read the whole thing. 
From a former FBI special agent who now teaches at Yale: 
The former White House counsel who flipped on Richard Nixon said 
Mueller can change the conversation: 
Nixon's White House counsel says Mueller provided House committee with 'a roadmap' 
2) Can Democratic leaders keep expectations in check and 
prevent the hearings from becoming a circus? 
Privately, many House Democrats and their aides worry they will not 
be able to. This is going to be a television extravaganza. Cable 
channels on the right and left will cover Mueller's appearance wall 
to wall. The networks will likely preempt regularly scheduled 
programming. But if Mueller doesn't say anything groundbreaking or 
EFTA00021204
--- PAGE 4 ---
explosive despite weeks of hype, the narrative could be that his 
appearance was a let down for Democrats. 
Moreover, it's politically imperative for Democrats that they look like 
they are motivated by a pursuit of the truth rather than a partisan 
vendetta against the president. Underscoring why that is, Trump 
cried "Presidential Harassment!" last night when news broke of 
Mueller's appearance. 
Grandstanding lawmakers pulling sophomoric stunts could play into 
Trump's hands. Think of Rep. Steve Cohen eating Kentucky Fried 
Chicken last month when Attorney General Bill Barr didn't show up 
for a hearing. 
An Obama-era Justice Department spokesman tried to keep 
expectations check: 
A Democratic senator from Hawaii emphasized that it will take an 
election to replace Trump: 
Asked about Mueller testimony, Trump pivots to Mueller's 'conflicts' of interest 
3) Will Trump's Republican allies successfully cast doubt on 
Mueller's credibility and stain his sterling reputation? Or will 
they come across as partisan and unserious about his 
conclusions? 
EFTA00021205
--- PAGE 5 ---
"Bob Mueller better be prepared," Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) told 
Laura Ingraham on Fox News last night. "Because I can tell you, he 
will be cross-examined for the first time and the American people 
will start to see the flaws in his report." 
"The first thing he needs to answer is his own conflicts of interest," 
added Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow on Sean Hannity's Fox show. 
Mueller's unwillingness to engage in a tit-for-tat with Trump and Co. 
throughout his probe kept him above the fray, but it also allowed the 
president's boosters to make scurrilous charges about the Vietnam 
veteran's integrity without strong pushback. Does he finally stand up 
for himself? Or does he cling to the idea that the quality of his work 
product speaks for itself? 
Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.), the only GOP lawmaker who has 
endorsed impeachment, does not sit on either committee so he 
won't get a round of questioning. 
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) 
continues to resist calls to hold hearings on the Mueller report in the 
other chamber. "It is `case closed' for me," Graham told Hannity on 
Fox last night. "They can do anything they want to in the House, 
and I think it will blow up in their face. ... The conclusions can't 
change." 
How Barr appeared to misrepresent Mueller's findings 
4) Does Mueller's appearance make it easier or harder for 
Nancy Pelosi to contain calls for impeachment from her 
caucus? 
EFTA00021206
--- PAGE 6 ---
"Members of Congress must honor our oath and our patriotic duty to 
follow the facts, so we can protect our democracy," the speaker said 
in a statement last night. 
Nearly 80 House Democrats are now on the record calling for 
opening impeachment proceedings against Trump. Mueller's sole 
public appearance in May didn't include any new information, but it 
nonetheless offered a justification for a stream of Democratic 
presidential candidates to call for the president's impeachment. 
Something similar could happen again. More House Democrats 
could use whatever Mueller says as cover to change their positions 
— or they could oppose impeachment on the grounds that oversight 
is being conducted without it. 
The answer probably depends primarily on whether Mueller's 
testimony moves the needle in the polls. As Pelosi loves to say, 
"Public sentiment is everything."

5) Will any of Mueller's lieutenants appear? 
"An unspecified number of the special counsel's senior deputies are 
expected to accompany their former boss and testify in closed 
session when Mueller appears next month," Politico's Darren 
Samuelsohn and Kyle Cheney report. "Schiff declined Tuesday 
night to identify the deputies, and it was also unclear if they would 
EFTA00021207
--- PAGE 7 ---
be appearing under subpoena. Democrats also haven't precluded 
bringing the former Mueller lawyers back for additional rounds. 'I 
think that's likely to happen after Mueller testifies,' said Rhode 
Island Rep. David Cicilline, another Judiciary Committee Democrat. 
'There are additional witnesses. But he's the principal in terms of 
the contents of the report.-
Mueller's team has been scattering. "Andrew Goldstein, a senior 
assistant special counsel under Mueller, will join the Cooley law firm 
as a litigation partner working in New York and Washington," 
Zapotosky reported on Monday. "On Friday, the firm Paul Weiss 
announced it would add Jeannie Rhee, another senior member of 
Mueller's team who had left the WilmerHale firm to work on the 
special counsel investigation. The Justice Department revealed this 
week that Michael Dreeben, a deputy solicitor general who has 
argued more than 100 cases before the Supreme Court and took a 
sabbatical to work with Mueller, would be leaving the department. ... 
Last month, the firm Davis Polk announced it would add Greg 
Andres, the senior assistant special counsel who led the 
prosecution of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, to 
its litigation department in New York. ... Andrew Weissmann, 
another senior assistant special counsel who is now a fellow at New 
York University School of Law, is writing a book."

-- No matter what happens, Mueller's testimony won't clear the 
thicket of thorny legal issues facing Trump. There was a 
significant development yesterday, for example, in one of the 
emoluments challenges: 
"Rejecting a request from President Trump, a federal judge in 
Washington on Tuesday cleared the way for nearly 200 
Democrats in Congress to continue their lawsuit against him 
alleging that his private business violates an anti-corruption 
provision of the Constitution," Ann Marimow,  Jonathan O'Connell 
and Carol Leonnig report. "U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan 
declined to put the case on hold and said lawmakers could begin 
this week seeking financial information, interviews and other 
records from the Trump Organization. ... Sullivan ordered the two 
parties to begin the process of requesting records and other 
information as part of a three-month discovery period from Friday to 
Sept. 27. ... The Trump administration still can try to delay or block 
Democrats in Congress from issuing subpoenas for the president's 
closely held business information by appealing directly to the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to intervene. ... Justice 
Department spokeswoman Kelly Laco said the government would 
appeal." 
The emoluments clauses bar the president from accepting gifts or 
payments from foreign or state governments. The cases, which 
seem destined for the Supreme Court, mark the first time that 
federal judges have interpreted these clauses. Trump is being sued 
by the members of Congress in one case and states in the other. In 
the second case, brought by the attorneys general of the 
District of Columbia and Maryland, a federal judge also denied 
the Trump administration's request for an immediate appeal. 
EFTA00021209
--- PAGE 9 ---
But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, which is 
based in Richmond and hears Maryland-related federal 
appeals, agreed to review the case and temporarily blocked 
subpoenas for financial records and other documents related to 
Trump's D.C. hotel. The 4th Circuit heard oral argument in March 
and could issue a ruling at any time.

-- The National Riffle Association shut down NRATV. The New 
York Times's Danny Hakim reports: "The N.R.A. on Tuesday also 
severed all business with its estranged advertising firm, Ackerman 
McQueen, which operates NRATV, the N.R.A.'s live broadcasting 
media arm ... While NRATV may continue to air past content, its live 
broadcasting will end and its on-air personalities —Ackerman 
employees including Dana Loesch — will no longer be the public 
faces of the N.R.A. It remained unclear whether the N.R.A. might try 
to hire some of those employees, but there was no indication it was 
negotiating to do so. ... 'Many members expressed concern about 
the messaging on NRATV becoming too far removed from our core 
mission: defending the Second Amendment,' Wayne LaPierre, the 
N.R.A.'s longtime chief executive, wrote in a message to members 
that was expected to be sent out by Wednesday. ... Ackerman, in its 
own statement, said it was 'not surprised that the N.R.A. is unwilling 
to honor its agreement to end our contract and our long-standing 
relationship in an orderly and amicable manner.-
-- An employee at a high-end Chicago cocktail bar was 
questioned by the Secret Service last night after allegedly 
spitting in Eric Trump's face, per Tim Elfrink and Mark Guarino.

• The president's son confirmed the incident at the Aviary to 
Breitbart News early this morning. "When somebody is sick 
enough to resort to spitting on someone, it just emphasizes a 
sickness and desperation and the fact that we're winning," the 
35-year-old told the right-wing site. 
• The Chicago Police Department's spokesman referred 
questions to the Secret Service, which did not  immediately 
comment. 
Rep. Duncan Hunter, wife charged with spending campaign money on personal expenses 
GET SMART FAST: 
1. Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) illegally misused campaign 
funds to facilitate extramarital affairs with at least five 
women, according to a new court filing from the Justice 
Department. Federal prosecutors want to show jurors evidence 
that Hunter took money from his campaign account to pay for 
dinners, drinks and trips with women he was romantically 
involved with — including an employee of his congressional 
office, a staffer to a member of House GOP leadership and 
three different lobbyists. A Democrat running against Hunter in 
2020 said "he's literally in bed with lobbyists." Hunter, who 
promises to fight the charges in court, declined to respond to 
any of the allegations. (Matt Zapotosky and Halley Fuchs) 
2. Federal prosecutors are fighting efforts to throw out the 
lenient non-prosecution agreement that Labor Secretary 
Alex Acosta, as a prosecutor, offered to alleged sex 
trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. The Justice Department told a 
federal judge that Epstein's alleged victims, who were not 
EFTA00021212
--- PAGE 12 ---
properly notified about what they view as a sweetheart deal, 
have no right to remedies from the government because the 
Crime Victims' Rights Act does not outline specific penalties. 
(Miami Herald) 
3. The National Security Agency ended a controversial 
counterterrorism program after learning that millions of 
Americans' phone records had been collected in error. The 
agency said its purged the records in what was the second 
instance of "over-collection" recorded by the NSA last year. 
(Ellen Nakashima) 
4. A new Alabama law severs the parental rights of those 
convicted of first-degree rape. The ability of convicted rapists 
in the state to seek custody of children conceived through their 
assaults gained renewed attention after Alabama passed a law 
outlawing abortion in nearly all circumstances, including 
instances of rape and incest. (Emily Wax-Thibodeaux) 
5. A court has ruled that the Office of Personnel Management 
is responsible for the 2015 hack of of 22 million people's 
personal information. According to a federal appeals court, 
the office ignored repeated warnings from its inspector 
general's office that the databases were vulnerable. (Eric Yoder) 
6. Two U.S. service members were killed in Afghanistan. No 
more information is known about them at this stage, including 
how they died. (CNN) 
7. Illinois became the 11th state to legalize marijuana for 
recreational use. The legalization will also let nearly 800,000 
EFTA00021213
--- PAGE 13 ---
people with criminal records for purchasing or possessing 30 
grams of marijuana or less expunge their records. (AP) 
8. An effort to boost lawmaker pay has been nixed after 
backlash. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer's plans were 
met with bipartisan protest. (Mike DeBonis and Karoun 
Demirjian) 
9. Tiffany Caban, a liberal public defender backed by Rep. 
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, declared victory in the Queens 
district attorney Democratic primary. Caban had a lead of 
just over 1,000 votes over her closest challenger with 99 
percent of precincts reporting in a race that became a national 
proxy battle. It's a blow for Greg Meeks and the Democratic 
establishment in New York. (CBS News) 
10. Three men were killed at a Ford dealership in California. A 
witness said that the shooter, whose body police found with an 
apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound, had been fired that day 
and came back to shoot two managers. (Mercury News) 
11. Paris is installing temporary water fountains and keeping 
pools open late to combat a massive heat wave hitting 
Europe. Temperatures across the continent are expected to 
rise up to 35 degrees Fahrenheit above normal, but France is 
being particularly cautious given the 15,000 deaths the country 
saw during a similar heat wave in 2003. (Claire Parker) 
12. The number of Americans who say they have never 
attended religious services has nearly doubled since 2000. 
According to the most recent NBC-Wall Street Journal poll, 26 
percent of Americans report never having attended religious 
services, compared to 14 percent in 2000. Among those 
EFTA00021214
--- PAGE 14 ---
between the ages of 18 and 34, the figure is even higher at 36 
percent. (Wall Street Journal) 
13. Jan Meyers, the first Republican woman elected to 
Congress from Kansas, died at 90. A moderate who 
represented a stretch of northeast Kansas from 1985 to 1997, 
Meyers rose through the ranks of the House to become chair of 
the Small Business Committee. (Harrison Smith) 
14. A YouTube star was found dead in New York's East River 
following a number of erratic videos and police 
confrontations. Desmond Amofah, known as Etika, was 
famous for his gaming channel, which he had recentuly turned 
into a venue for rants and confrontations with police officers. 
(Avi Selk) 
15. Breakdancing might make its first appearance at the 
Olympics soon after the International Olympic Committee 
voted in favor of a proposal that could bring the dance 
style to the 2024 Summer Games in Paris. Skateboarding, 
climbing/bouldering and surfing are also among the activities 
proposed to be added to the events program. (CNN)

THE IMMIGRATION WARS ARE KILLING PEOPLE:

--- PAGE 15 ---
-- The image of the drowned bodies of a Salvadoran man and 
his baby daughter lying face down on the bank of the Rio 
Grande after attempting to cross the border has sparked 
outrage as Trump's policies continue putting the lives of 
migrants at risk. From the AP's Peter Orsi and Amy Guthrie: "Her 
arm was draped around his neck suggesting she clung to him in her 
final moments. The searing photograph of the sad discovery of their 
bodies [see above] highlights the perils faced by mostly Central 
American migrants fleeing violence and poverty and hoping for 
asylum in the United States. ... Oscar Alberto Martinez Ramirez, 
frustrated because the family from El Salvador was unable to 
present themselves to U.S. authorities and request asylum, 
swam across the river on Sunday with his daughter, Valeria. He 
set her on the U.S. bank of the river and started back for his 
wife, Tania Vanessa Avalos, but seeing him move away the girl 
threw herself into the waters. Martinez returned and was able 
to grab Valeria, but the current swept them both away. ... 
"Details of the incident were confirmed Tuesday by a Tamaulipas 
government official ... and by Martinez's mother back in El Salvador, 
Rosa Ramirez, who spoke with her daughter-in-law by phone 
afterward. ... Ramirez said her son and his family left El Salvador on 
April 3 and spent about two months at a shelter in Tapachula, near 
Mexico's border with Guatemala. 'I begged them not to go, but he 
wanted to scrape together money to build a home,' Ramirez 
said. 'They hoped to be there a few years and save up for the 
house.' El Salvador's foreign ministry said it was working to assist 
the family including Avalos, who was at a border migrant shelter 
following the drownings. The bodies were expected to be flown to El 
Salvador on Thursday. ... The photo recalls the 2015 image of a 
3-year-old Syrian boy who drowned in the Mediterranean near

Turkey, though it remains to be seen whether it may have the 
same impact in focusing international attention on migration to 
the U.S. ... U.S. 'metering' policy has dramatically reduced the 
number of migrants who are allowed to request asylum, down from 
dozens per day previously to sometimes just a handful at some 
ports of entry." 
-- The House passed a $4.5 billion emergency border aid bill 
that includes provisions requiring better treatment of migrant 
children in U.S. custody, which were added to secure passage 
amid bubbling anger over Trump's handling of the crisis. Mike 
DeBonis and Erica Werner report: "The 230-to-195 vote, largely 
along party lines, followed a flurry of last-minute negotiations among 
Democrats who said they have been horrified by reports of poor 
conditions at overcrowded U.S. Customs and Border Protection 
facilities where unaccompanied children have been kept. The bill's 
passage sets up a high-stakes negotiation with Trump and Senate 
Republicans to deliver aid days before a looming deadline. ... 
House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita M. Lowey (D-
N.Y.) unveiled changes to the bill Tuesday morning that would 
require CBP to establish new health and safety standards for 
migrants in its custody, as well as protocols for dealing with migrant 
surges, within 30 days. The changes would also limit children's 
stays at 'influx' shelters used by the Department of Health and 
Human Services to no more than 90 days and require the 
department to report to Congress on their use." 
-- Palace intrigue: A week after beginning his reelection 
campaign with promises of mass deportations, Trump sent the 
agencies responsible for immigration enforcement deeper into 
disarray by replacing his interim border chief with a figure he 
EFTA00021217
--- PAGE 17 ---
plucked from cable news punditry last month. "Mark Morgan, 
who Trump installed as acting director of U.S. Immigration and 
Customs Enforcement in early June, will take over as acting 
commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, replacing John 
Sanders," per Nick Miroff and Josh Dawsey. "The shake-up 
Tuesday comes after weeks of interagency squabbles and political 
knifings among agency officials ... Since April, the president has 
purged nearly all of the top officials remaining at DHS from the 
beginning of his term, leaving every immigration-related U.S. 
agency with an interim leader. ... 
"Immigration hard-liners in recent days have been pushing 
Trump to remove acting DHS secretary Kevin McAleenan at the 
moment when the policies McAleenan has advanced —
including a deal with Mexico for an unprecedented immigration 
crackdown there — are beginning to yield results. U.S. 
authorities detained more than 144,000 migrants last month along 
the Mexico border, the highest level since 2006, but preliminary 
reports indicate fewer have been crossing in recent weeks and 
others are being turned back by Mexican military forces. McAleenan 
on Tuesday was en route to meetings with officials in Central 
America, where the Trump administration is seeking a separate 
accord that would allow the United States to send asylum seekers 
back to the first foreign nation where they step foot after fleeing their 
homelands. 
"McAleenan had challenged the feasibility and timing of the 
[ICE] raids ... Morgan had pushed for the `family op' to go 
forward, and it was not clear whether the decision to move him 
from ICE to a loftier position at CBP was a consolation for losing out 
to McAleenan. ... One person who has spoken with Trump about 
EFTA00021218
--- PAGE 18 ---
immigration said the president has heard from senior immigration 
adviser Stephen Miller and others around him that `everyone at 
DHS is weak.-
-- The U.S. returned 100 migrant children to the overcrowded 
border facility in Clint, Tex., after trying to find temporary 
alternatives — including tents and other border 
facilities. Immigration and health authorities say they are 
simply out of space. Abigail Hauslohner reports: "Officials from 
U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which first takes the migrants 
into custody, and from the Department of Health and Human 
Services, which runs the migrant children's shelters, characterized 
the situation as a dire humanitarian crisis but also defended U.S. 
treatment of young migrants as adhering to the law. And universally, 
Trump administration officials Tuesday used the moment to urge 
Congress to swiftly approve billions of dollars in border funding that 
they say would provide bed space and services for children. ... A 
CBP official said Tuesday that the allegations of child neglect at 
Clint were being investigated but also that the child detainees in the 
agency's custody receive `continuous' access to hygiene products 
and adequate food while awaiting placement in U.S. shelters 
designed for children." 
-- A federal appeals court ordered that a Maryland judge take a 
fresh look at the new evidence that the Trump administration 
had discriminatory intent in adding a citizenship question to 
the 2020 Census. Robert Barnes,  Felicia Sonmez and Tara 
Bahrampour report: "The order was part of last-minute wrangling in 
the lower courts, in the Supreme Court and on Capitol Hill as the 
justices are set to vote on the issue before the end of their term, 
presumably this week. ... Solicitor General Noel Francisco, 
EFTA00021219
--- PAGE 19 ---
representing the Trump administration, told the Supreme Court that 
the order from the 4th Circuit jeopardizes' the census process. ... 
He had said in an earlier letter to the Supreme Court that the claims 
in the Maryland case were `based on a speculative conspiracy 
theory that is unsupported by the evidence and legally irrelevant to 
demonstrating that Secretary Ross acted with a discriminatory 
intent.-
-- Reporters are being kept away from the facilities where 
migrant children are being held. Paul Farhi reports: "News stories 
emerged last week about squalid conditions at a Border Patrol 
detention facility housing about 300 migrant children on the U.S.-
Mexico border. ... Apart from their appalling specifics, the stories 
were notable for one element: They were all based on secondhand 
accounts. Reporters were unable to see the facilities themselves or 
speak to any of the children. Instead, they relied on descriptions 
provided by lawyers and advocates who were granted access under 
a legal settlement with the Border Patrol. ... The blackout on press 
access has left Americans largely in the dark about conditions in 
government facilities designed to handle migrants who have 
crossed the border. Photographs and TV images are rare and often 
dated. Rarer still are interviews with federal agency managers and 
employees or with the children themselves." 
-- Sarah Fabian, the Justice Department lawyer who flippantly 
argued in open court that toothbrushes and soap are not 
required for the government to provide children sanitary living 
conditions, defended herself in a private Facebook post that 
one of her friends leaked to NBC. Josh Lederman reports:
"Fabian says she shares `many people's anger and fear' about the 
nation's future. Saying she is `not an official of any administration,' 
EFTA00021220
--- PAGE 20 ---
Fabian points out that she's a career federal employee who's 
served in her role since 2011. Fabian expresses regret that her 
comments in the video 'struck a nerve' but argues that selective 
editing, combined with a lack of precision in her argument created a 
false impression. 'I think that many many people believe I was in 
court Tuesday arguing against providing certain hygiene items to 
kids,' Fabian writes, adding later: 'I do not believe that's the position 
I was representing.-
-- Elizabeth Warren called for decriminalizing illegal border 
crossings. HuffPost's Roque Planas reports: "Warren joins fellow 
2020 contender Julian Castro and several other prominent 
Democrats in backing a reform that, if enacted, would give civil 
immigration courts exclusive legal control over immigration 
enforcement at the border. ... While Warren has yet to release a 
comprehensive immigration platform, her campaign confirmed to 
HuffPost that she also now favors repealing the law criminalizing 
migration." Make no mistake: Trump will use this as a devastating 
cudgel against her if she becomes the Democratic nominee.

THE NEW WORLD ORDER: 
-- Any prospect of easing tensions between the United States 
and Iran seemed increasingly remote yesterday, as threats and 
personal insults flew between the two governments. Karen 
EFTA00021221
--- PAGE 21 ---
DeYoung reports: "Any attack on 'anything American,' tweeted the 
president — who last week called off a military strike that was to 
have been launched after Iran shot down a U.S. drone — will bring 
'overwhelming' U.S. force and 'obliteration' of some Iranian assets. 
... Beneath the din, no new options emerged for avoiding a conflict 
that both sides say they do not want, and more doors appeared to 
be closing rather than opening. In Washington, even those who fully 
and vocally support the administration's 'maximum pressure' 
sanctions policy have begun to question whether Trump has a 
strategy. ... Other experts said that Trump's summit strategy with 
nuclear-armed North Korea, in which both leaders had reason to 
seek the public spectacle of a meeting, but whose governments 
have yet to substantively address their differences, would not work 
with Iran." 
-- South Korea's Moon Jae-in said the U.S. and North Korea are 
talking about a third nuclear summit between the two 
countries' leaders. From the Wall Street Journal's Timothy W. 
Martin: "Mr. Moon didn't provide a timeline for the meeting between 
President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. He said 
the two sides had held 'behind-the-scenes' talks, not official 
dialogue, after February's Vietnam summit that ended abruptly 
without a deal. The South Korean leader's remarks come just days 
before President Trump is scheduled to visit Seoul, a trip that is 
viewed as an effort to help jump-start talks with Pyongyang." 
-- Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, presented his 
Middle East peace plan but did not reveal how the White House 
plans to achieve such a deal. Loveday Morris reports: "The White 
House's economic plan envisages $50 billion in regional investment 
projects over the next decade, more than half in the West Bank and 
EFTA00021222
--- PAGE 22 ---
Gaza, and the rest in Jordan, Egypt and Lebanon. But the initiative 
has been met with widespread skepticism and already has been 
rejected by the Palestinian leadership ... The White House plan 
makes no mention of Palestinian aspirations for statehood or of 
ending Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories. Rather, the plan 
pulls together previously proposed infrastructure projects, including 
a transport link between Gaza and the West Bank as well as 
increased capacity at Gaza's power station to address crippling 
electricity outages. ... How the economic projects would be 
financed remains unsettled, and the Bahrain meeting is not 
intended to raise money, said a U.S. official." 
-- The U.S. Air Force veteran who was accused of acting as a 
mercenary in Libya's civil war has been freed. Missy Ryan, Josh 
Dawsey and Julie Tate report: "Jamie Sponaugle, a 31-year-old 
Florida man, was piloting an aircraft near the Libyan capital of 
Tripoli on May 7 when his plane went down, according to officials 
and individuals familiar with the incident, who spoke on the 
condition of anonymity. The Libyan National Army said it shot down 
the aircraft, which it said was a Mirage Fl combat jet piloted by a 
man The Washington Post is now identifying as Sponaugle, as it 
conducted bombing raids against LNA forces in the area. The Post 
withheld publication of Sponaugle's detention at the request of U.S. 
officials who were working to secure his release." 
-- Trump is flying today to the G20 in Japan with most of his 
foreign policy gambits hanging in the balance. David Nakamura 
and Damian Paletta report: "The president is slated to meet at the 
Group of 20 summit in Osaka with key allies and adversaries —
including China's Xi Jinping, Russia's Vladimir Putin, Japan's 
Shinzo Abe, Saudi Arabia's Mohammed bin Salman and India's 
EFTA00021223
--- PAGE 23 ---
Narendra Modi — as he seeks to clinch an elusive trade pact with 
Beijing, consolidate international support in a tense staredown with 
Tehran and navigate a path forward on stalled nuclear talks with 
North Korea. ... The upshot is that 2% years into his presidency, 
Trump is facing a crucial test of his 'America First' agenda, one that 
has alienated traditional allies over disputes on trade and defense 
spending and set the United States apart from global consensus on 
how to deal with climate change and Iran's nuclear program. Having 
generally thumbed his nose at multilateral engagements in favor of 
a go-it-alone approach, Trump has shown a preference for leader-
to-leader diplomacy and following his gut instincts instead of 
rigorous preparation, which have left him in a precarious position." 
-- The son of an American jailed in China on spy charges asked 
Trump to plead his father's case at the summit. Gerry Shih 
reports: "Harrison Li, the son of the New York-based aircraft parts 
exporter Kai Li, is calling on Trump to raise the case of his father —
believed to be the only American citizen held in China on state 
security charges — during a meeting with Xi this week, when Trump 
is expected to seek the release of two Canadians similarly detained 
by China's opaque security apparatus. ... Harrison Li said Trump 
should use his meeting with Xi to intervene on behalf of his father, 
whose ordeal has gone largely unnoticed for nearly three years 
while the State Department and Li's supporters worked quietly, but 
unsuccessfully, to secure his release." 
-- Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said the U.S.-China trade 
deal is "90 percent" complete. From CNBC's Holly Ellyatt: "He 
said he's confident Trump and Xi can make progress in stalled trade 
talks at the G-20 meeting this weekend. 'The message we want to 
hear is that they want to come back to the table and continue 
EFTA00021224
--- PAGE 24 ---
because I think there is a good outcome for their economy and the 
U.S. economy to get balanced trade and to continue to build on this 
relationship.' He did not provide any detail on what the final 10% of 
an agreement might entail, or what the sticking points are to 
completing a deal." 
What to expect from Democrats on the crowded debate stage 
DEBATE PREP: 
-- As the Democratic debates start tonight in Miami, Ashley 
Parker looked back at how the 2016 GOP primary kicked off 
"the era of the mega-debate — a bigger field of candidates, a 
bigger slate of debates, bigger ratings, bigger stakes and a 
bigger need for a standout exchange." Parker writes: "The trick 
for the Democrats, as with their Republican predecessors, is to find 
a way to capture attention and break away from the pack. Trump 
didn't necessarily win the debates themselves four years ago, 
but he always won the show — and, with it, the White House. 'I 
tell people these are not debates,' said former Arkansas governor 
Mike Huckabee, who ended his presidential run in February 2016. 'I 
was a debater in high school and college, and these are not 
debates. These are television shows.' Trump, a former reality TV 
star, quickly realized that every circus needs a ringmaster and 
appointed himself to the role. ... Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, one of 
Trump's most vocal rivals in 2016, said moderators `are often 
looking for fireworks' — a phenomenon he suspects Democrats will 
also encounter." 
DNC Chairman Tom Perez is facing fires on a number of 
fronts as the debates get underway. Michael Scherer reports: "In 
EFTA00021225
--- PAGE 25 ---
just the last month, he has been accused by fellow Democrats of 
unfairly changing debate qualifications to exclude the governor of 
Montana, setting thresholds that could unjustly remake the race in 
September, and treating elected members of Congress as 'second-
class citizens' by denying them a decisive nominating vote at the 
2020 Democratic convention. Nearly 100 climate change activists 
staged a sit-in at party headquarters Tuesday to demand a debate 
on the issue. The Republican National Committee recently 
announced raising $75.6 million through the first five months of the 
year, more than twice as much as Perez's party, with a greater 
share of the money coming from donations under $200. But Perez 
... is not discouraged. The party, he says, is on track, never mind 
the haters." 
-- The debates could be a particularly defining moment for 
Cory Booker, who has struggled to break out in the crowded 
field even though he had been viewed as a likely candidate for 
years. The Times's Jonathan Martin and Nick Corasaniti report: "Mr. 
Booker is more comfortable 'leading with love,' as he often says in 
speeches, and he warns against 'fighting fire with fire' when it 
comes to confronting [Trump]. It's an approach that could pay off 
with Democratic primary voters, who surveys indicate are far more 
eager to find a candidate who wants to unite the country than 
merely fight against Republicans. But it does not make for cable 
television or social media catnip, which has shaped the early 
contours of the race. ... No other Democratic candidate but him has 
such a sophisticated organization and support network in Iowa, New 
Hampshire and South Carolina but is mired closer to zero than 
double digits in most every early nominating state." 
EFTA00021226
--- PAGE 26 ---
-- The debates are unfolding in a city that is already facing the 
daily reality of climate change. The Times's Patricia Mazzei 
reports from Miami: "[T]he urgency of the climate issue is beginning 
to take hold in Florida. That is especially true in the Miami-Fort 
Lauderdale area, where 49 percent of respondents, compared with 
percent elsewhere in the state, said they had made physical 
changes to their homes in the past year to protect against sea-level 
rise, flooding or extreme weather. The latest daily heat record in 
Miami was broken on Sunday, only the third day of summer, when 
the temperature reached 95 degrees. The high on Monday, 98 
degrees, tied the existing record." 
-- Split-screen: Vice President Pence traveled to Miami a day 
before the debates started to launch a national "Latinos for 
Trump" initiative. Pence called Trump "a great champion of Latino 
and Hispanic Americans," citing a decline in Hispanic 
unemployment since he took office. "President Trump promised to 
get this economy moving again, and President Trump delivered," 
Pence said. "President Donald Trump is the best friend that Latino 
and Hispanic businesses have ever had in the White House." When 
the vice president touched on border security, the crowd broke out 
in chants of "Build the wall." (John Wagner)

THE ME TOO MOVEMENT: 
EFTA00021227
--- PAGE 27 ---
-- The latest sexual assault allegation against Trump has been 
greeted with relative silence on Capitol Hill — particularly by 
Republicans. Colby Itkowitz, Emily Davies and Hailey Fuchs 
report: "The muted reaction to the claim by [magazine columnist E. 
Jean Carroll], who said Trump attacked her in a dressing room more 
than two decades ago, reflected a sense among resigned 
Democrats that the president will never face serious political 
damage from accusations of sexual misconduct, which 16 women 
have now made. ... Republicans remained largely silent about 
Carroll's allegation. The one political figure who has brought the 
most attention to her story is Trump, who has denied it, saying she 
was 'not my type.' When asked Tuesday whether Trump's response 
was appropriate, [Mitch McConnell] replied, 'I don't have any 
comments about that.-
-- Other Republicans dismissed Carroll's allegation outright, 
specifically citing the assault allegations against Supreme 
Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. "Quite honestly, as somebody 
who had a front-row seat to the Kavanaugh hearings, we've seen 
allegations that were false," Tillis said. "We'll let the facts go where 
they are, but I take [Trump's] statement at face value." "Many times 
when folks have made these allegations they're also promoting a 
book," said Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.). "All I would say: We live in 
an environment where people can come forward. That's good. But 
allegations like this have to be cautiously reviewed," said Sen. 
Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), adding that he has "no reason not to" 
believe Trump. (Politico)
-- Two Republican senators — Joni Ernst (Iowa) and Mitt 
Romney (Utah) — called for Carroll's allegations to be 
investigated. "I think anybody that makes an accusation like that, 
EFTA00021228
--- PAGE 28 ---
they should come forward," Ernst said when asked about Carroll's 
claim. "But obviously there has to be some additional information. 
They need to interview her. They need to visit with him." Romney 
called for an "evaluation" of the accusation but added that he didn't 
know who should conduct it, "whether it's Congress or whether it's 
another setting, I'm not sure." (CNN)

Stephanie Grisham will replace Sanders as press secretary 
ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN AND WOMEN: 
-- Stephanie Grisham, the first lady's communications director, 
will replace Sarah Sanders as White House press secretary. 
John Wagner reports: "The move was first announced by [Melania] 
Trump in a tweet and later confirmed by White House officials. In 
addition to succeeding Sanders, Grisham will also take on the 
duties of White House communications director, a job that has been 
vacant since March. 'She has been with us since 2015 - @potus & I 
can think of no better person to serve the Administration & our 
country,' the first lady said in her tweet. ... Grisham, 42, is one of 
Trump's last remaining campaign aides serving in the White House. 
Before becoming the first lady's communications director in March 
2017, she worked in the West Wing as a deputy to Trump's first 
press secretary, Sean Spicer." 
-- House Republicans are preparing to go after a Trump 
appointee who used to work for them on the Hill after he 
released a report that said White House counselor Kellyanne 
Conway should be fired for blatantly violating the Hatch Act. 
Rachael Bade and Lisa Rein report: "Henry Kerner, head of the 
Office of Special Counsel, is scheduled to testify Wednesday about 
EFTA00021229
--- PAGE 29 ---
his report. ... Democrats on the House Oversight Committee, who 
invited Conway to testify, plan to vote to subpoena her if she fails to 
show for the hearing, as expected. Republicans are intent on using 
the session to question the credibility and judgment of Kerner, one 
of the panel's top investigators for more than three years when 
Republicans were in charge. ... After Kerner takes the witness seat, 
Republicans plan to argue he applied the law unfairly in Conway's 
case, pointing to what they say were similar statements by top 
Obama administration political appointees." 
-- "Sean Lawler, a State Department official whose title is chief 
of protocol, is departing amid a possible inspector general's 
probe into accusations of intimidating staff and carrying a 
whip in the office," per Bloomberg's Jennifer Jacobs and Daniel 
Flatley. "The protocol chief assists the president on overseas trips, 
and when foreign leaders visit the White House, by making 
introductions and briefing the president on protocol. Lawler, a fixture 
in the Oval Office during dignitaries' visits, served as the president's 
liaison to the diplomatic corps at the State Department. ... Trump 
has little fondness for Lawler, and repeatedly asked why he still 
worked at the White House." 
-- The Justice Department sued Omarosa Manigault Newman 
for failing to file a legally required personal financial disclosure 
report after she was fired two years ago. Politico's Josh Gerstein 
reports: "The lawsuit says Manigault Newman never filed the report 
required from departing senior staffers and largely ignored 
numerous requests from White House lawyers to submit the report 
following her acrimonious departure from her post as 
communications director in the Office of Public Liaison. The suit, 
filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Washington, asks a judge to 
EFTA00021230
--- PAGE 30 ---
order Manigault Newman to file the report and to pay a civil penalty 
of $50,000 for `willfully' defying the ethics mandate."

MORE ON 2020: 
-- Joe Biden continues to play down his leadership role 
in laying the groundwork for policies of mass incarceration 
that continue to devastate black communities. The Times's 
Sheryl Gay Stolberg  and Astead W. Herndon call him out: "Mr. 
Biden apologized in January for portions of his anti-crime 
legislation, but he has largely tried to play down his involvement, 
saying in April that he `got stuck with' shepherding the bills because 
he was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. But an 
examination of his record — based on newly obtained 
documents and interviews with nearly two dozen longtime 
Biden contemporaries in Washington and Delaware —
indicates that Mr. Biden's current characterization of his role is 
in many ways at odds with his own actions and rhetoric. ... 
While Mr. Biden has said in recent days that he and [Mississippi 
Sen. James ] Eastland `didn't agree on much of anything,' it is clear 
that on a number of important criminal justice issues, they did. As 
early as 1977, Mr. Biden, with Mr. Eastland's support, pushed for 
mandatory minimum sentences that would limit judges' discretion in 
sentencing. But perhaps even more consequential was Mr. Biden's 
EFTA00021231
--- PAGE 31 ---
relationship with [South Carolina Sen. Strom] Thurmond, his 
Republican counterpart on the judiciary panel, who became his co-
author on a string of bills that effectively rewrote the nation's 
criminal justice laws with an eye toward putting more criminals 
behind bars." 
-- Bernie Sanders has pointed to Germany's tuition-free 
universities as an example that America should follow, but 
such a system involves trade-offs. Michael Birnbaum reports:
"[T]here is little magic to how European countries keep costs down 
for their students: Even though most impose far higher income 
taxes than the United States does, they still spend less money 
on education. ... [The German university RWTH Aachen] has no 
grand athletic center. ... Professors' salaries cannot compete with 
those at top American universities, although they may carry double 
the teaching load, making it difficult to hire U.S. stars. Its dormitories 
are modest brick affairs. Some lecture halls are dingy and don't 
seem to have been updated much since the 1950s, when they were 
built from Germany's post-World War II rubble. Some of its lectures 
top 1,000 students." 
-- Pete Buttigieg has spoken little of his time spent in Iraq and 
Afghanistan as a consultant for McKinsey between 2007 and 
2010. ABC News's Lee Ferran and Ali Dukakis report: "In his 
memoir, 'Shortest Way Home,' he mentions his involvement in 
domestic projects for the firm like doing energy efficiency research 
in the U.S., and goes into particular detail about one that involved 
analyzing North American grocery prices. But when it comes to his 
work abroad with McKinsey, he only drops hints about working on 
'war zone economic development to help grow private sector 
employment' in Iraq and Afghanistan. He also refers to a 'safe 
EFTA00021232
--- PAGE 32 ---
house' in Baghdad. The book doesn't say exactly when or how long 
Buttigieg was in either country. And beyond that, details are scarce -
- by design." 
-- Warren unveiled a $20 billion proposal to federalize national 
elections. Annie Linskey reports: "Warren proposes buying new 
voting machines for all of the roughly 8,000 election jurisdictions in 
the country, mandating automatic and same-day voter registration 
and giving all voters access to 15 days of early voting and voting by 
mail. Her plan would also bar purges of voter lists, with exceptions 
for 'death, change of address, or loss of eligibility to vote.' And it 
would provide financial incentives for states to adopt the new 
federal standards for local elections. Republicans would almost 
certainly fight such a proposal, which at a minimum would require 
major legislation by Congress." 
-- A new Pew poll shows stark partisan divisions in how 
Americans view capitalism and socialism. The Pew Research 
Center's Hannah Hartig reports: "Overall, a much larger share of 
Americans have a positive impression of capitalism (65%) than 
socialism (42%) ... There are large partisan differences in views of 
capitalism: Nearly eight-in-ten Republicans and Republican-leaning 
independents (78%) express somewhat or very positive reactions to 
the term, while just over half of Democrats and Democratic leaners 
(55%) say they have a positive impression. But these differences 
are dwarfed by the partisan gap in opinions about socialism. More 
than eight-in-ten Republicans (84%) have a negative impression of 
socialism; a 63% majority has a very negative view. Nearly two-
thirds of Democrats (65%) have a positive view of socialism, 
but only 14% have a very positive view." 
EFTA00021233

-- Some Democrats believe Stacey Abrams holds the key for 
victory and are reaching out to her in hopes of copying her 
tactics and to win her blessing. Cleve R. Wootson Jr. and 
Vanessa Williams report: "But if Abrams is becoming an oracle for 
Democrats, she's an emerging target for Republicans. At a Capitol 
Hill hearing Tuesday, she was challenged by Rep. Douglas A. 
Collins (R-Ga.), who complained that her celebrity supporters are 
maligning the state by claiming that she would be governor 'if 
Georgia wasn't racist.' Collins also pressed Abrams on whether she 
had pushed for noncitizens to vote, which she strongly denied. 
Abrams's unmistakable presence hangs over the Democratic 
presidential race, and not just because she hasn't quite ruled out 
running. Many black and liberal voters find Abrams a moving, 
authentic figure — with her unapologetic style, tough childhood and 
long devotion to voting rights — while many of the presidential 
candidates are struggling to win over the black community." 
-- Trump endorsed Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), who is facing two 
GOP primary challengers in North Carolina. Tillis "has really 
stepped up to the plate," Trump tweeted last night. "Thom is tough 
on Crime, Strong on the Border and fights hard against Illegal 
Immigration. He loves our Military, our Vets and our great Second 
Amendment. I give Thom my Full and Total Endorsement!" (Felicia

Expose High School's Use of Prison Labor," by Eli Hager: "Last 
January, at his high school's chorus fundraiser, 17-year-old Spencer 
Cliche overheard a chat between a parent and a 'trusted faculty 
member.' (As a student journalist, he told me, he does not reveal his 
sources.) The seats in the auditorium, Spencer says he heard the 
two adults saying, were going to be reupholstered using prison 
labor. He didn't think much of it at first. But later in the semester

when his journalism class studied prison issues, he mentioned what 
he'd heard to the teacher, Sara Barber-Just, a two-decade veteran

Baguet on a crimson staircase where he announced to rapturous 
applause that reporters David Barstow, Susanne Craig and Russ 
Buettner had won the Pulitzer Prize for their groundbreaking story

months ago, a lot of people thought that this new coalition of the far

seemingly had no doubt. 'He made an offer we couldn't refuse,' said

NEWS YOU CAN USE IF YOU LIVE IN D.C.: 
-- We are still in the middle of a heat wave, but at least the 
humidity is not that bad. The Capital Weather Gang  forecasts: 
"Our late-June heat wave continues today but still lacks the 
oppressive humidity we so often see around here. The heat and 
humidity do both step it up a notch tomorrow and especially Friday 
and Saturday. We may finally see a bit better chance of a few 
showers and storms this weekend."

his side of the story after the FBI raided his home as part of a

due process to be able to tell my side of my story and answer any

from reporters. The D.C. Council is preparing to launch an internal 
investigation into Evans and remove him as chairman of the 
Committee on Finance and Revenue. After Evans's comments, 
Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) agreed to allow Evans to

Re: 
Jeffrey Epstein 
Dear Mr. Goldberger: 
FINALM/TIFICATIQNOLMENTIFIELLYIKMAS 
On June 30, 2008, Jeffrey Epstein (hereinafter referred to as "Epstein) entered a plea 
of guilty to violations of Florida Statutes Sections 796.07 (felony solicitation of prostitution) 
and 796.03 (procurement of minors to engage in prostitution), in the 15th Judicial Circuit in 
and for Palm Beach County (Case Nos. 2006-cf-009454AXXXMB and 2008-cf-
00938 1 AXXXMB) and was sentenced to a term of twelve months' imprisonment to be 
followed by an additional six months' imprisonment, followed by twelve months of 
Community Control 1, with conditions of community confinepent imposed by the Court. 
In light of the entry of the guilty plea and sentence, the United States has agreed to 
defer federal prosecution in favor of this state plea and sentence, subject to certain 
conditions. 
One such condition to which Epstein has agreed is the following: 
"Any person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an offense 
enumerated in Title 18, United States Code, Section 2255, will have the same 
rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she would have had, if Mr. Epstein 
had been tried federally and convicted of an enumerated offense. For purposcs

attorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to name in an 
Indictment as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein. Any judicial 
authority interpreting this provision, including any authority determining 
which evidentiary burdens if any a plaintiff must meet, shall consider that it is 
the intent of the parties to place these identified victims in the same position 
as they would have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no 
less." 
Through this letter, this Office hereby provides Notice that the individuals identified 
below are individuals whom the United States was prepared to name as victims of an

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK 
x 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
INDICTMENT 
Cr. 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, 
Defendant. 
The Grand Jury charges: 
OVERVIEW 
1. 
As set forth herein, over the course of many years, 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, sexually exploited and abused 
dozens of minor girls at his homes in Manhattan, New York, and 
Palm Beach, Florida, among other locations. 
2. 
In particular, from at least in or about 2002, up to 
and including at least in or about 2005, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, enticed and recruited, and caused to be enticed and 
recruited, minor girls to visit his mansion in Manhattan, New 
York (the "New York Residence") and his estate in Palm Beach, 
Florida (the "Palm Beach Residence") to engage in sex acts with 
him, after which he would give the victims hundreds of dollars 
in cash. Moreover, and in order to maintain and increase his 
supply of victims, EPSTEIN also paid certain of his victims to 
recruit additional minor girls to be similarly abused by 
EPSTEIN. In this way, EPSTEIN created a vast network of 
EFTA00021252
--- PAGE 2 ---
underage victims for him to sexually exploit, often on a daily 
basis, in locations including New York and Palm Beach. 
3. 
The victims described herein were as young as 14 years 
old at the time they were abused by JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, and were, for various reasons, often particularly 
vulnerable to exploitation. Moreover, EPSTEIN, who 
intentionally sought out minors, knew that many of victims were 
in fact under the age of 18, including because, in some 
instances, victims expressly told him that they were underage. 
4. 
In creating and maintaining this network of minor 
victims in multiple states to sexually abuse and exploit, 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, worked with others, including 
employees and associates who facilitated his conduct by, among 
other things, contacting victims and scheduling their sexual 
encounters with EPSTEIN at the New York Residence and at the 
Palm Beach Residence. 
FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
5. 
During all time periods charged in this Indictment, 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, was a financier with multiple 
residences in the continental United States, including the New 
York Residence and the Palm Beach Residence. 
6. 
Beginning in at least 2002, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, enticed and recruited, and caused to be enticed and 
recruited, dozens of minor girls to engage in sex acts with him, 
EFTA00021253
--- PAGE 3 ---
after which EPSTEIN paid the victims hundreds of dollars in 
cash, at the New York Residence and the Palm Beach Residence. 
7. 
In both New York and Florida, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, perpetuated this abuse in similar ways. Victims were 
initially recruited to provide "massages" to EPSTEIN, which 
would be performed nude or partially nude, became increasingly 
sexual in nature, and would typically include one or more sex 
acts. EPSTEIN paid his victims hundreds of dollars in cash for 
each encounter. Moreover, EPSTEIN actively encouraged certain 
of his victims to recruit additional minor girls to be similarly 
sexually abused. EPSTEIN incentivized his victims to become 
recruiters by paying these victim-recruiters hundreds of dollars 
for each minor girl that they brought to EPSTEIN to be sexually 
abused. In so doing, EPSTEIN maintained a steady supply of new 
victims to exploit. 
The New York Residence 
8. 
At all times relevant to this Indictment, JEFFREY 
EPSTEIN, the defendant, possessed and controlled a multi-story 
private residence on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, New York, 
i.e., the New York Residence. Between at least in or about 2002 
and in or about 2005, EPSTEIN abused numerous minor victims at 
the New York Residence by causing these victims to be recruited 
to engage in sex acts with him, after which EPSTEIN would 
provide the victims with hundreds of dollars in cash. 
EFTA00021254
--- PAGE 4 ---
9. 
When a victim arrived at the New York Residence, she 
would be escorted to a room with a massage table, where she 
would perform a massage on JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant. The 
victims, who were as young as 14 years of age, were told by 
EPSTEIN or other individuals to partially or fully undress 
before beginning the "massage." During the encounter, EPSTEIN 
would escalate the nature and scope of physical contact with his 
victim to include, among other things, sex acts such as groping 
and direct and indirect contact with the victims' genitals. 
EPSTEIN typically would also masturbate during these sexualized 
encounters, ask victims to touch him while he masturbated, and 
touch victims' genitals with his hands or with sex toys. 
10. In connection with each sexual encounter, JEFFREY 
EPSTEIN, the defendant, or one of his employees or associates, 
paid the victim in cash. Victims typically were paid hundreds 
of dollars for each encounter. 
11. JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, knew that certain of 
his victims were underage, including because certain victims 
told him their age. Further, once these minor victims were 
recruited, many were abused by EPSTEIN on multiple subsequent 
occasions at the New York Residence. EPSTEIN sometimes 
personally contacted victims to schedule appointments for 
"massages" at the New York Residence. In other instances, 
EPSTEIN directed employees and associates, including a New York-
EFTA00021255
--- PAGE 5 ---
based employee ("Employee-1"), to communicate with victims via 
phone to arrange for these victims to return to the New York 
Residence for additional sexual encounters with EPSTEIN. 
12. Additionally, and to further facilitate his ability to 
abuse minor girls in New York, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, 
asked and enticed certain of his victims to recruit additional 
minor girls to perform "massages" and similarly engage in sex 
acts with EPSTEIN. When a victim would recruit another minor 
girl for EPSTEIN, he paid both the victim-recruiter and the new 
victim hundreds of dollars in cash. Through these victim-
recruiters, EPSTEIN gained access to and was able to abuse 
dozens of additional minor girls. 
13. In particular, certain recruiters brought dozens of 
additional minor girls to the New York Residence to give 
"massages" to and engage in sex acts with JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant. EPSTEIN encouraged victims to recruit additional 
minor girls by offering to pay these victim-recruiters for every 
additional minor girl they brought to EPSTEIN to be sexually 
abused. When a victim-recruiter accompanied a new minor victim 
to the New York Residence to be exploited by EPSTEIN, both the 
victim-recruiter and the new minor victim were paid hundreds of 
dollars by EPSTEIN for each encounter. In addition, certain 
victim-recruiters routinely scheduled these encounters through 
EFTA00021256
--- PAGE 6 ---
Employee-1, who sometimes asked the recruiters to bring a 
specific minor girl for EPSTEIN. 
The Palm Beach Residence 
14. In addition to recruiting and abusing minor girls in 
New York, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, created a similar 
network of minor girls to victimize in Palm Beach, Florida, 
where EPSTEIN owned, possessed and controlled another large 
residence, i.e., the Palm Beach Residence. EPSTEIN frequently 
traveled from New York to Palm Beach by private jet, including 
on occasions in which an employee or associate would ensure that 
minor victims were available for encounters upon his return to 
Florida. 
15. At the Palm Beach Residence, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the 
defendant, engaged in a similar course of abusive conduct. 
When a victim initially arrived at the Palm Beach Residence, she 
would be escorted to a room, sometimes by an employee of 
EPSTEIN's, including, at times, two assistants who, as described 
herein, were also responsible for scheduling the sexual 
encounters with minor victims ("Employee-2" and "Employee-3"). 
Once inside, the victim would provide a nude or semi-nude 
massage for EPSTEIN, who would himself typically be naked. 
During these encounters, EPSTEIN would escalate the nature and 
scope of the physical contact to include sex acts such as 
groping and direct and indirect contact with the victims' 
EFTA00021257
--- PAGE 7 ---
genitals. EPSTEIN would also typically masturbate during these 
encounters, ask victims to touch him while he masturbated, and 
touch victims' genitals with his hands or with sex toys. 
16. In connection with each sexual encounter, JEFFREY 
EPSTEIN, the defendant, or one of his employees or associates, 
paid the victim in cash. Victims typically were paid hundreds 
of dollars for each encounter. 
17. JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, knew that certain of 
his victims were underage, including because certain victims 
told him their age. In addition, as with New York-based 
victims, many Florida victims, once recruited, were abused by 
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, on multiple additional 
occasions. 
18. JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, who during the 
relevant time period was frequently in New York, would arrange 
for Employee-2 or other employees to contact victims by phone in 
advance of EPSTEIN's return to Florida to ensure appointments 
were scheduled for when he arrived. In particular, in certain 
instances, Employee-2 placed phone calls to minor victims in 
Florida to schedule encounters at the Palm Beach Residence. At 
the time of certain of those phone calls, EPSTEIN and Employee-2 
were in New York, New York. Additionally, certain of the 
individuals victimized at the Palm Beach Residence were 
contacted by phone by Employee-3 to schedule these encounters. 
EFTA00021258
--- PAGE 8 ---
19. Moreover, as in New York, to ensure a steady stream of 
minor victims, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, asked and enticed 
certain victims in Florida to recruit other minor girls to 
engage in sex acts. EPSTEIN paid hundreds of dollars to victim-
recruiters for each additional minor girl they brought to the 
Palm Beach Residence to be sexually abused by EPSTEIN. 
STATUTORY ALLEGATIONS 
COUNT ONE 
(Sex Trafficking Conspiracy) 
20. From at least in or about 2002, up to and including in 
or about 2005, in the Southern District of New York and 
elsewhere, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, the defendant, and others known and

Second, our case agent told us that FBI received a flight manifest from CBP last night. The passengers listed are 
Epstein and two pilots. Of course, that is subject to change, and I'm told that FBI will try to get confirmation of 
the passengers after the flight takes off.

On the third question, I think there may have been one or two victims who expressed an interest in attending but didn't 
make it (I recall that 
missed a flight, and I'm not sure if anyone else had issues like that), but I don't believe 
any of those people in particular told us that they wanted to make a statement.

For the first question, the AUSAs contacted the attorneys we were aware of who represented victims to tell them that 
their clients were welcome to attend and to make a statement. I believe 
also sent out notifications, and hopefully 
she can tell us how many she sent. 
For the second question, based on my review of the transcript (attached), a total of 17 victims were present at the hearing 
and either spoke at the hearing or had someone read a statement for them. An additional 7 did not attend the hearing 
but had someone else speak for them or read a statement from them. It is possible there were others present who were 
not referenced on the record. 
I don't think we can answer the third question. I don't recall anyone off the top of my head who wanted to attend but 
was unable to, but it's possible there were some in that position.

The Petitioner in the Epstein CVRA case has filed an appeal to the 11th Circuit. One of their issues is the 
District Court's refusal to hold a hearing allowing the Epstein victims to "have their day in court." The 
Court's ruling is, in part, on the basis that a hearing held in SDNY satisfied this request. The Petitioner has 
alleged that not all of the Epstein victims who wanted to speak were able to do so at the New York hearing 
because they did not have sufficient notice and were unable to travel to NY. 
Can your office provide us some details about the following: 1) how many victims were contacted about 
making a victim impact statement; 2) how many victims were able to travel and make an in-person victim 
impact statement; and 3) how many victims indicated they wanted to make a victim impact statement but 
were unable to do so given the notice/timing of the hearing? 
Please provide as much of this information as possible today. I'm very sorry for the quick turnaround but 
the Department's response to the mandamus petition is due tomorrow 
I really appreciate your assistance.

Re: Autopsy Report and File for Jeffrey Epstein 
Dear Ms. Hutner: 
As you are aware, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New 
York ("USAO") and the Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI") are conducting an ongoing 
criminal investigation into the events related to Mr. Epstein's August 10, 2019 suicide at the 
Metropolitan Correctional Center ("MCC") (the "Criminal Investigation"). As you are also aware, 
between August 10, 2019, and August 16, 2019, at OCME's request and in order to assist OCME 
in determining the cause and manner of Mr. Epstein's death, the USAO and FBI gave OCME 
access to certain materials and information gathering during the Criminal Investigation. 
As discussed by phone, while the OCME autopsy is now complete, the Criminal 
Investigation remains ongoing. As such, and in order to avoid compromising the Criminal 
Investigation, we request that OCME withhold from disclosure to any third party any documents, 
evidence or information made available to OCME by the USAO or FBI—including documents, 
records, or materials from the MCC—or created by OCME or within the OCME case file that 
include, reflect, or contain information made available to OCME by the USAO or FBI. We also 
request that you withhold from any disclosure the names and identifying information of any federal 
law enforcement agents or employees who were interviewed by the OCME, along with the 
substance of any statements or interviews made by those agents or employees.

We appreciate your willingness to comply with this request. Should you decide at any 
future point, notwithstanding this request, to produce any of the above-referenced material to any 
third party, we request that you notify us before you do so, so that we may seek additional process. 
Please contact us with any further questions. 
Very truly yours,

Re: Autopsy Report and File for Jeffrey Epstein 
Dear Ms. Hutner: 
By letter dated August 28, 2019, the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern 
District of New York ("USAO") requested that the OCME withhold from disclosure to any third 
party (i) "any documents, evidence or information made available to OCME by the USAO or the 
FBI—including documents, records, or materials from the MCC—or created by OCME or within 
the OCME case file that include, reflect, or contain information made available to OCME by the 
USAO or FBI"; and (ii) "the names and identifying information of any federal law enforcement 
agents or employees who were interviewed by the OCME, along with the substance of any 
statements or interviews made by those agents or employees" (the "August 28 Letter"). 
At OCME's request, the USAO has made proposed redactions to the version of the OCME 
report and file for Jeffrey Epstein that was previously provided by OCME to the FBI, consistent 
with the requests set forth in the August 28 Letter. That redacted document is attached hereto. For 
the reasons set forth in the August 28 Letter, we also request that OCME withhold from disclosure 
to any third party any photographs of the scene at the MCC. Finally, in order to preserve the 
integrity of the ongoing investigation, in addition to the requests set forth in the August 28 Letter, 
we also request that OCME withhold from disclosure to any third party this letter and its 
attachment, and the August 28 Letter. We appreciate your willingness to comply with these 
requests. Please contact us with any further questions. 
Very truly yours,

- sorry for the delay but I have been trying to get a handle on who is coming for the meeting etc. 
is a victim that I think will be helpful to your continuing investigation. She is working hard with your 
victims' coordinator to see if she can get here for the meeting. If she gets her passport/visa clearance and gets to the US 
then we could do an interview on the afternoon of Tuesday October 22rd starting at 2:00 if that works. I think she will 
probably take a bit longer because she was brought to the US by Epstein a number of times so maybe a lot 2 hours for the 
interview (from 2-4).

In connection with the Epstein victim services meetings, could you also let us know the date of the New York meeting, 
assuming it's still the plan to do a meeting in both locations? 
And on the same subject, do you know when notifications are going out about those meetings, and who's coordinating 
that? We'd like to talk to whoever is doing the notices so we can make sure it's clear that there won't be any substantive 
update about the investigation or the status of the case. We won't be attending for that reason, and we don't want any 
victims or their counsel to have the misimpression that this is anything but purely services-related info. 
We'll also circle up internally about whether we could come down that week for interviews, separately—I'll be in Nashville 
from the 15th through the 18th for a separate work trip, but will check with

So the short answer is that the load files are not completed yet. One machine alone had over 800,000 emails. 
The limitation of the load files is that they can only be generated with 25,000 entries at a time. So I got out as 
quickly as I could what fit that bill. Now along has come all the stuff from the Island that had an expiration 
date, so that took priority. I can now go back and try to generate the stuff that has yet to be processed into load 
files, but the process is slow and painful. Just as an FYI, all the content is available for taint review in FTK

Hello 
— sorry for the delay but I have been trying to get a handle on who is coming for the meeting etc. 
is a victim that I think will be helpful to your continuing investigation. She is working hard with your 
victims' coordinator to see if she can get here for the meeting. If she gets her passport/visa clearance and gets to the US 
then we could do an interview on the afternoon of Tuesday October 22rd starting at 2:00 if that works. I think she will 
probably take a bit longer because she was brought to the US by Epstein a number of times so maybe a lot 2 hours for the 
interview (from 2-4). 
is going to be attending the meeting and she said she could interview with you right after the 
meeting. I believe the notice says the meeting starts at 10:00 on October 23rd so maybe we plan to meet you at 12:00 
depending on the length of the victims' meeting. 
also wanted to come to the meeting. I know you met with her for a short while. If you would like to meet 
with her for a more detailed interview we could do that on the afternoon of October 22nd from 4 — 6 if that works. 
is 
She would like to try to attend via skype or some kind of conference line. 
I know you interviewed her sister 
Let me know if that works.

I think we will be ready to propose a schedule sometime early next week. Is there a day and time when you can meet to 
discuss? We will send you a proposed briefing schedule ahead of the meeting. I hope to have ours finalized no later than

Thanks, we appreciate it. In terms of a 
in general, based on our conversations with her attorneys, we expect 
she'll eventually tell us that she was 18 years old when she arrived in the U.S. through Brunel's modeling agency, and 
that she met Epstein shortly thereafter at a party and he invited her to his houses, and she quickly became dependent 
on him financially, and also that her modeling opportunities seemed to somewhat mysteriously dry up at the same 
time. (The media reporting that she was "sold" to Epstein by her parents and/or that she knew him when she was a 
minor are inaccurate.) She quickly became Epstein's "girlfriend" but was also subjected to significant sexual abuse, 
including being directed by him to engage in sexual encounters with other young women (though never any other 
men). Her attorneys say they believe she doesn't recall knowing that any of those individuals were minors. They also 
recounted a pretty horrifying list of other controlling behaviors, including encouraging disordered eating, requiring 
plastic surgery, etc., which not surprisingly resulted in a lot of negative feelings but also some Stockholm Syndrome / 
attachment disorder kinds of responses. 
Also generally, it doesn't seem like she had much interaction with Maxwell, whom 
believed didn't like her; in 
the initial several years of being in Epstein's orbit, 
also had relatively little interaction with 
despite 
being in proximity to her on trips and sometimes in the residences. Her attorneys say that Epstein discouraged the 
various women from talking with each other, and that 
and 
were in different silos in his life (girlfriend 
vs. assistant), but that 
and 
actually ended up becoming friends after Epstein was prosecuted in 
Florida. That was also around the time 
started to become more independent of Epstein, and she broke off 
their relationship in approximately 2010 (though she continued to receive financial support from him, and has lived in 
the 
building for many years, up through Epstein's arrest in July). 
All that said, we expect that because tomorrow is the first proffer, it likely will be a high-level discussion going through 
the chronology and starting to build rapport. In subsequent proffers we hope to get into more detail about 
information that would corroborate the accounts of other victims/witnesses as to Epstein's other associates, 
conversations or understandings relating to 
and Maxwell in particular, and any other relevant information as to 
anyone else she has information on.

apologies for that, and we tried several times to find other available times (but were significantly constrained because 
the agents aren't available all of next week), and originally was planned for later in the afternoon but defense counsel

Re: 
Hyperion Air, LLC 
Dear AUSA Moe: 
MATTHEW L. SCHWARTZ 
Tel.: 
E-mail: 
October 15, 2019 
I am writing to briefly follow up on our conversation this afternoon. As I told you, I 
represent a client who has been in negotiations to purchase a Keystone (Sikorsky) model S-76C 
helicopter from a U.S. Virgin Islands entity called Hyperion Air, LLC. The agreed-upon purchase 
price for the aircraft is $3.5 million, with a $100,000 deposit that my client has already paid into 
escrow. The parties are currently negotiating a final purchase agreement, and the seller — who as I 
mentioned is being represented by Darren K. Indyke — is pushing for a November 15, 2019 closing 
for the transaction. 
We have recently come to understand that Hyperion Air, LLC is an entity associated with 
Jeffrey Epstein. We therefore wanted to advise your Office of this transaction before it is finalized. 
Although my client has no reason to believe that the aircraft may be subject to forfeiture — it was 
not identified in the forfeiture language of the charging instruments against Epstein, it was not 
acquired by Hyperion Air until long after the charged conduct, and we have no reason to believe 
that it was purchased with criminally-derived funds or is otherwise potentially subject to forfeiture 
— we of course wanted to give the Office the opportunity to take any action that it may deem 
appropriate, including blocking the transaction or ensuring that the proceeds are deposited into 
escrow. 
As we discussed, we look forward to hearing back from the Office. As I mentioned when 
we spoke, in the absence of guidance from the Office, it is my client's intention to proceed with the 
transaction. If we do not hear back from you before then, I will check back in before my client 
signs the purchase agreement. 
Respectfully, 
Is/ Matthew L. Schwartz

Thanks again for sending this! Not sure there's a federal nexus, but the lawyer representing the victims represents 
several Epstein victims, so I might reach out to her to see if there could possibly be something to work with. 
If you see anything else like this, I'd be happy to have it passed along to me. I'm hoping to bring more sex abuse cases in 
VOC.

This may be dumb and I don't know if there's a federal nexus, but thought this was interesting (and had no idea who

someone would follow up with her, hopefully in the next week or so. The call lasted less than three minutes. 
For context, we were in touch with Mr. 
several times in 2020 when he claimed to represent at least nine Epstein 
victims, all of which he said were unwilling to speak with us. He subsequently said one victim might be willing to speak 
with us, but then stopped responding to our requests for the complaints he had purportedly filed (but which we couldn't 
find online). I believe the last communication we had with him was the attached.

M, 
I hope all is well. Ghislaine Maxwell's attorneys filed a third bail application earlier today. As part of that application, they 
proposed that she will renounce her French and British citizenship, claiming that such a renunciation obviates the Court's

arguments in the first half are strong, but I'm really not wild about the second half. Would very much appreciate your

For context, we were in touch with Mr.

victims, all of which he said were unwilling to speak with us. He subsequently said one victim might be willing to speak 
with us, but then stopped responding to our requests for the complaints he had purportedly filed (but which we couldn't 
find online). I believe the last communication we had with him was the attached.

Hi Eff 
I wanted to make you aware of a recent filing (on Tuesday) by Jane Doe 1 and 2 in the Florida CVRA case. See attached. 
You may find interesting our argument at pp. 3-6, in which we explain why Judge Marra must craft remedies in the case 
that relate solely to Florida crimes and Florida victims ... because the NPA only covers Florida. 
We filed our reply brief on remedies on Tuesday— and that should have brought all briefing on remedies for the CVRA 
violation to a close. But yesterday Epstein's lawyer (Marty Weinberg) filed a motion for a sur-reply. See attached. In 
point (a) on page 2, he argues that he should have an opportunity to file a sur-reply discussing, among other things, the 
scope of the NPA. On Monday, we will be filing an opposition to Weinberg extending the briefing further. It appears that 
Judge Marra is poised to rule rapidly on the motion for a sur-reply, as he asked for us to respond quickly. 
I wanted to make you aware of these developments. My clients were told back in 2013 that the NPA did not extend to 
New York or other jurisdictions — and that is the point we are making to Judge Marra.

Hi M, 
I wanted to make you aware of a recent filing (on Tuesday) by Jane Doe 1 and 2 in the Florida CVRA case. See attached. 
You may find interesting our argument at pp. 3-6, in which we explain why Judge Marra must craft remedies in the case 
that relate solely to Florida crimes and Florida victims ... because the NPA only covers Florida. 
EFTA00021392
--- PAGE 2 ---
We filed our reply brief on remedies on Tuesday — and that should have brought all briefing on remedies for the CVRA 
violation to a close. But yesterday Epstein's lawyer (Marty Weinberg) filed a motion for a sur-reply. See attached. In 
point (a) on page 2, he argues that he should have an opportunity to file a sur-reply discussing, among other things, the 
scope of the NPA. On Monday, we will be filing an opposition to Weinberg extending the briefing further. It appears 
that Judge Marra is poised to rule rapidly on the motion for a sur-reply, as he asked for us to respond quickly. 
I wanted to make you aware of these developments. My clients were told back in 2013 that the NPA did not extend to 
New York or other jurisdictions — and that is the point we are making to Judge Marra.

Good morning, 
Mola Lenghi with CBS News here. Hoping to confirm a report we're seeing out there. 
Not sure if you can. 
"Federal prosecutors have subpoenaed Jeffrey Epstein's longtime person pilots as investigators seek to question 
the financier's employees in the wake of his indictment on sex-trafficking charges." 
Confirmation? 
Thanks for considering.

representation of 
in connection with 
receipt of a grand jury subpoena. So you have contact info 
for our full team, we're all reachable anytime at the copied emails or by phone at: 
As we briefly discussed, the documentary materials we are seeking from

flight manifests, flight plans, or other documents reflecting passengers and/or travel records, dating back to 2000. And 
we would like to hear fromillabouabservations, if any, of young women or girls on flights, as well as any 
discussions with Mr. Epstein about his relationships with young women or girls, or his legal issues relating to those 
relationships. We are also interested to know the identities of Epstein's employees and staff whom 
is 
aware of, current and previous. 
As I mentioned on the phone, given the prospect of attorney proffer information and/or a possible voluntary interview, 
we are prepared to hold in abeyance the current subpoena return date of July 22, 2019.

Thanks for letting us know about the possible meeting location change— please let us know once you've been able to

Regarding the court conference, we are unfortunately not able to reserve seats for anyone—the court manages court 
security and the crowd, so we don't have control over that. The other victim attorneys have been attending the 
conferences on their own, and although I don't know, I would guess that means that they have been arriving early.

Hi MI 
I just tried your desk. Do we have a time this afternoon when you can meet? Let us know as soon as you can because 
Mark will be in court soon and will not have his phone. 
Also, would you mind asking the CSOs to allow us to bring our phones into the building? Let me know if that's a problem. 
Thanks, 
Chris

Following up on my very brief conversation with Chris earlier this afternoon, and the voicemail you left earlier, thanks for 
getting in touch regarding your representation of Ms. Maxwell. I understand you'll be in our neighborhood tomorrow 
afternoon; we can make ourselves available to meet, but will that have been enough time for you to speak with your 
client? Let us know what you think would be best to proceed, and we'll figure out next steps.

Just bumping this briefly—obviously no obligation to respond to these, but to give you an opportunity to before we file 
this afternoon, if you'd like, wondering if: 
There is any additional information you're able to provide about the passport; and 
Whether you're willing to tell us if Mr. Epstein is, or has been in the past, a citizen or legal permanent 
resident of a country other than the United States.

The Bloom Firm represents two women who allege they were fraudulently recruited and enticed 
by Epstein and/or his agents to perform a personal massage on him at his private residence, 
located at 9 East 71st St., New York, NY 10021, in exchange for hundreds of dollars that resulted 
in Epstein forcefully sexually assaulting our clients in what we believe is in violation of Title 18,

United States Code, Sections 1591(a) and (b). Our clients believe they were assaulted by 
Epstein in or around June 2004. Our clients did not consent or agree to any sexual touching or

recovered from Mr. Epstein's home, that sexually explicit pictures were unknowingly taken of

Please 
be advised, our clients wish to remain anonymous at this juncture and do not consent to their

is necessary for the case to move forward, please advise prior to doing so, so that our clients can 
make an informed decision. 
We understand your office may be interested in interviewing our clients for additional details. We

I think it would be useful to get a better understanding of your position—it would be helpful for us to know, for 
example, how much time you propose to take to evaluate matters, and whether we can provide any additional 
information that might be useful for that process of evaluation. That likely will affect our determination 
regarding the grand jury appearance, at which we would expect, were we to call 
to ask her a number 
of questions we would expect to argue to the court do not implicate a fifth amendment privilege—i.e., that she 
couldn't simply blanket invoke. Would it be useful to discuss via phone?

reverse proffers before? You're totally welcome to be in on it, but it will just be her lawyer, no witness statements

Mike, 
I think it would be useful to get a better understanding of your position—it would be helpful for us to know, for 
example, how much time you propose to take to evaluate matters, and whether we can provide any additional 
information that might be useful for that process of evaluation. That likely will affect our determination 
regarding the grand jury appearance, at which we would expect, were we to call 
to ask her a number 
of questions we would expect to argue to the court do not implicate a fifth amendment privilege—i.e., that she 
couldn't simply blanket invoke. Would it be useful to discuss via phone?

HIM, 
I wanted to make you aware of a recent filing (on Tuesday) by Jane Doe 1 and 2 in the Florida CVRA case. See attached. 
You may find interesting our argument at pp. 3-6, in which we explain why Judge Marra must craft remedies in the case 
that relate solely to Florida crimes and Florida victims ... because the NPA only covers Florida. 
We filed our reply brief on remedies on Tuesday— and that should have brought all briefing on remedies for the CVRA 
violation to a close. But yesterday Epstein's lawyer (Marty Weinberg) filed a motion for a sur-reply. See attached. In 
point (a) on page 2, he argues that he should have an opportunity to file a sur-reply discussing, among other things, the 
scope of the NPA. On Monday, we will be filing an opposition to Weinberg extending the briefing further. It appears that 
Judge Marra is poised to rule rapidly on the motion for a sur-reply, as he asked for us to respond quickly. 
I wanted to make you aware of these developments. My clients were told back in 2013 that the NPA did not extend to 
New York or other jurisdictions — and that is the point we are making to Judge Marra.

v. 
UNITED STATES 
JANE DOE 1 AND JANE DOE 2'S REPLY TO INTERVENOR EPSTEIN'S BRIEF IN 
OPPOSITION TO PROPOSED REMEDIES 
COME NOW Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2 (also referred to as "the victims"), by and through 
undersigned counsel, having previously provided a submission on proposed remedies (DE 458) 
and in light of Intervenor Epstein's' Brief in Opposition (DE 463) (hereinafter cited as "Epstein 
Remedies Br."), to now reply to Epstein in support of their submission on proposed remedies. For 
the reasons explained in their earlier submissions (see, e.g., DE 458 and 464) and below, the Court 
should reject the Intervenor Epstein's arguments and grant Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2 the various 
remedies their seek to enforce and protect their rights under the Crime Victims' Rights Act 
(CVRA) — including rescission of the non-prosecution agreement. 
INTRODUCTION 
As Jane Doe 1 and 2 explained in their earlier submissions, this case involves deception of 
dozens of Florida victims of an international sex trafficking organization — the organization led by 
As discussed below, Epstein was granted "limited" intervention in this case to address 
remedies. Since remedies are now at issue, Epstein has full intervention rights and will be 
referenced throughout this reply as "Intervenor Epstein."

Intervenor Epstein. The Government2 and Epstein reached a secret non-prosecution agreement 
(NPA) and then concealed that agreement until it was firmly in place — and the victims lost any 
opportunity to object. This secret justice for Epstein and his co-conspirators has led to a national 
outcry about unfairness and unequal treatment of the wealthy and powerful in the criminal justice 
system. 
This Court has previously determined that Jane Doe 1 and 2's CVRA rights to confer with 
prosecutors were violated through the machinations of prosecutors and Epstein. This Court then 
called for briefing on the appropriate remedy for that violation. DE 454. Jane Doe I and 2 have 
proposed rescission of the NPA's "immunity" provisions, which have prevented victims from 
conferring with prosecutors in the USAO-SDFL about prosecuting Epstein for the crimes he 
committed in Florida against them. Epstein claims that this remedy is not available to this Court. 
But the Court has previously held that it is a permissible remedy and nothing that Epstein raises 
should cause the Court to reverse course. The NPA's immunity provisions were founded in 
illegality — specifically, their concealment from the victims - something that Epstein well knew 
and, indeed, specifically sought. Accordingly, this Court can and should rescind the immunity 
provisions as the appropriate remedy for the victims. Rescission will vindicate Jane Doe 1 and 2's 
CVRA rights, by permitting them to confer with prosecutors in this district about obtaining federal 
prosecution here — against Epstein and all of his coconspirators. 
Epstein has little to say about the other remedies that the Jane Does seek, and accordingly 
the Court should (for reasons articulated earlier) grant those remedies as well. 
References to the "Government" in this case should be generally understood to refer to 
the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida (USAO-SDFL), which is currently 
being represented by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia.

Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 6 of 70 
THIS CASE MUST BE DECIDED ON THE AGREED PREMISE THAT THE NPA 
ONLY COVERS THE U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT 
OF FLORIDA. 
For many years, this case has been litigated on the premise that the NPA negotiated by 
Epstein with prosecutors in the Southern District of Florida only precludes his prosecution in the 
Southern District of Florida. Indeed, the NPA's plain terms directly limit the agreement to "this 
District." See NPA at 2 (noting that the agreement was signed "on the authority of R. Alexander 
Acosta, United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida" and requires that "prosecution 
in this District for [various federal offenses] shall be deferred" and that no federal prosecution of 
Epstein "will be instituted in this District"). This is consistent with the statute creating the Office 
of U.S. Attorney, which allows each U.S. Attorney to prosecute offenses only "within his district." 
U.S.C. § 547. 
In light of this plain language, the NPA has no application to prosecutors in other judicial 
districts, such as the Southern District of New York. See United States v. Fernandez, No. 17-CR-
167 (JMF), 2017 WL 6372783 at *2 (S.D.N.Y. 2017) ("The Second Circuit has squarely held that 
"[w]hen the express terms of a plea agreement set forth promises by `the Government,' . . . the 
plea agreement binds only the office of the United States Attorney for the district in which the plea 
is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction, or 
unless there is evidence to show that a prosecutor is attempting to evade its own obligations under 
the plea agreement by transferring a prosecution to another office" (citing United States v. 
Salameh, 152 F.3d 88, 120 (2d Cir. 1998)). 
The fact that the USAO-SDFL's agreement with Epstein applies only to the Southern 
District of Florida has been made explicitly throughout this litigation — without any objection from 
EFTA00021447
--- PAGE 7 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 7 of 70 
Intervenor Epstein. See, e.g., DE 205-6 at 30 (". . the USAO-SDFL did not bargain away the 
possibility of federal criminal charges being instituted in other districts based on alleged sexual 
acts that Epstein committed against [Jane Doe I and 2]. Such charges can still potentially be 
pursued in other districts, such as the Southern District of New York . . .."); DE 205-2 at 8-9 ("a 
number of districts outside the Southern District of Florida (e.g., the Southern District of New 
York ...) share jurisdiction and venue with the Southern District of Florida over potential federal 
criminal charges based on the alleged sexual acts committed by Epstein against [Jane Doe 1 and 
2]. Epstein is thus subject to potential prosecution for such acts in those districts."); see also DE 
464 at 13 n.4 ("The NPA negotiated by attorneys in the Southern District of Florida obviously only 
precluded prosecution in the Southern District of Florida"). Several of the remedies the victims 
have proposed are clearly predicated on this long-standing assumption. For example, the victims 
have sought documents about the investigation regarding Epstein conducted by FBI-Miami 
(remedy #10), education in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida (remedy 
#14), and sealed remedies involving other U.S. Attorney's Offices (remedy #18). The victims 
would have crafted all of these proposed remedies (and others) differently if they had any 
suggestion from Epstein that this case involved immunity that extended nationwide. 
Moreover, other important aspects of this case have involved the predicate that this case 
concerned Epstein's federal crimes subject to prosecution in this District. 
For example, 
Government notifications to crime victims about this case have apparently only gone to Epstein 
victims in this District. 
Intervenor Epstein's factual "background" section of his brief only makes clearer that the 
NPA at issue in this case does not have any nationwide reach. As Epstein's "background" section

--- PAGE 8 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 8 of 70 
argues, the negotiations between the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida 
(USAO-SDFL) and Epstein's high-powered legal team focused on the defense claim that this case 
"was, at heart, a local sex abuse case." Epstein Remedies Br. at 15 (quoting former First Assistant 
U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Sloman). 
Indeed, one of the experts that Intervenor Epstein hired 
represented to the Justice Department during discussions about the NPA that "[t]his is a case about 
purely local activity, involving local actors, and affecting local interests and thus, should be 
handled by local authorities." Id. at 15. In other words, according to Epstein's defense attorneys 
at the time that the NPA was under consideration, this was not a case "present[ing] 
multijurisdictional obstacles" beyond the ability of "States and localities" to confront. Id. at 16. 
This Court has previously ruled that this case is to be decided based on a possible CVRA 
rights violation "of Jane Doe 1, Jane Doe 2, and all `other similarly situated victims' (DE 324 at 
9), where all the victims under contemplation have been victimized by Epstein through federal 
crimes subject to prosecution here. Ultimately, as Epstein himself puts it, this case involves "the 
exercise of discretion by ... federal prosecutors in the Southern District of Florida." Id. at 18. 
It is common knowledge that Intervenor Epstein is currently being prosecuted by federal 
prosecutors in the Southern District of New York. The NPA in this case has no connection to or 
bearing on that prosecution there — and the Court should craft remedies for the victims in this 
District for the violations of rights that occurred here.

DISCUSSION 
I. 
INTERVENOR EPSTEIN HAS RECEIVED PROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS 
THROUGH AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD AND SUBMIT EVIDENCE ON 
ISSUES PERTAINING TO REMEDIES. 
A. 
As an Intervenor, Epstein Has Received Procedural Due Process. 
Intervenor Epstein begins his arguments with a procedural claim that he has somehow been 
denied "procedural due process" in this matter. Epstein Remedies Br. at 14-19. His argument is 
difficult to understand. More than six years ago, Epstein filed a motion for "limited intervention" 
in this case, seeking to "intervene in these proceedings when and if they reach the stage at which 
the Court will consider what remedy to order if it finds that the government violated the [victims'] 
rights under the CVRA." DE 207 at 1. As Epstein explained in his motion, this Court had earlier 
ruled that "rescission relief' was an available remedy in this case. Id. Accordingly, Epstein had 
"clear and compelling interest[s] in opposing any remedy that would entail rescission of his non-
prosecution agreement with the government," and these interests were "personal to him and would 
not be adequately represented by the government should the Court determine that a CVRA 
violation occurred and that rescission or re-opening of the non-prosecution agreement was one of 
the remedial options under consideration." Id. The victims did not oppose his intervention. DE 
209 at 3-4. And the Court duly granted Epstein's intervention motion. DE 246 at 1 (order allowing 
Epstein "to intervene with regard to any remedy issue concerning the non-prosecution 
agreement"). 
Of course, this Court subsequently found a violation of the victims' CVRA rights, squarely 
posing remedial issues. And the Court thereafter asked for submissions on how to proceed to 
determine appropriate remedies, receiving briefing on scheduling from the two victims and the 
EFTA00021450
--- PAGE 10 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 10 of 70 
USAO-SDFL — and from Epstein. In his scheduling brief, Epstein explained that "[r]egarding the 
mechanism for determining remedy, neither party disputes that Mr. Epstein has a right to be heard 
. . . . Mr. Epstein respectfully submits that he should be given an opportunity to file a response to 
the substantive legal briefs of the parties on the issue of remedy within 30 days after [the victims'] 
brief is filed, before the Court permits the taking of any evidence in this matter." DE 453 at 2. 
Thereafter, the Court established a briefing schedule that essentially tracked what Epstein 
proposed, and specifically allowed Epstein to "file affidavits or declarations in support of his 
position." See DE 454 at 2. 
In the wake of all this, Intervenor Epstein now broadly asserts that "summary judgment 
was granted against the government, not Mr. Epstein" and that, therefore, "there can be no remedy 
that prejudices him." DE 463 at 25. But the legal support for this claim is a mystery. It was 
Epstein himself who proposed limited intervention as the appropriate procedural device to allow 
him to be heard in this case. And obviously Epstein has had full notice and opportunity to be heard 
on remedy issues, including an opportunity to submit any relevant evidence he wants and to 
challenge any finding that he believes are inaccurate. As Epstein's own authority makes clear, the 
key requirement for due process is whether a litigant has "received a `full and fair' opportunity to 
litigate [his] claims." Parklane Hosiery Co., Inc. v. Shore, 439 U.S. 322, 332 (1979). Epstein 
raises no suggestions that he has been denied that opportunity here. 
Epstein does point to the fact that the Eleventh Circuit has previously ruled in this case that 
he is not "an ordinary litigant." Jane Doe 1 v. United States, 749 F.3d 999, 1005 (11th Cir. 2014). 
But that ruling, which involved the disclosure of certain correspondence, is of no relevance now. 
The Eleventh Circuit was simply describing this Court's earlier ruling on intervention. Indeed, the 
EFTA00021451
--- PAGE 11 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 11 of 70 
Eleventh Circuit made clear it was fully approving this Court's approach of allowing Epstein to 
raise remedial issues at the end of the case: 
The victims argue that Epstein has made himself an ordinary litigant through his 
intervention, but we disagree. . 
[T]he district court has granted Epstein limited 
intervention to challenge only the disclosure of his attorneys' correspondence and 
any remedy that involves the non-prosecution agreement. Epstein's only 
opportunity to challenge the disclosure order is now because there will not be an 
adverse judgment against him or his attorneys. The district court instead will enter 
any judgment against either the victims or the United States. And, even if the victims 
succeed in their petition to rescind the non-prosecution agreement, Epstein can 
challenge only that remedy, not thejudgment against the United States. The victims 
intend to use the correspondence from Epstein's attorneys to prove that the United 
States violated the Act, which is an issue separate from the kind of relief necessary 
to remedy that violation. And it is all the more likely that the district court would 
fashion a remedy that does not involve the non-prosecution agreement, if the district 
court were to conclude that rescission is unavailable, which might then bar an 
appeal by Epstein of that remedy. 
749 F.3d at 1005-06 (emphasis added). Plainly when it ruled in 2014, the Eleventh Circuit foresaw 
a situation where Epstein might need to challenge a rescission remedy during a remedial phase of 
this case — which is precisely what has happened. 
The very purpose of allowing a person to intervene in a case is to ensure "that a single set 
of factual findings will bind" the intervenor and the other parties. Huff v. Commissioner of IRS, 
743 F.3d 790, 797 (11th Cir. 2014). And the "fundamental requirement of due process is the 
opportunity to be heard `at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.'" Reams v. hvin, 561 
F.3d 1258, 1263 (11th Cir. 2009) (quoting Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 333 (1976)). Here 
Epstein argues that he has been "deprived . . of the ability to contest numerous allegations and 
stipulations at the liability phase." Epstein Remedies Br. at 28. This is simply untrue. Epstein 
was free to challenge all allegations (and alleged "stipulations") from the liability phase, to the 
EFTA00021452
--- PAGE 12 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 12 of 70 
extent that they had any bearing on remedy. Indeed, this Court made clear that Intervenor Epstein 
could "file affidavits or declarations in support of his position." See DE 454 at 2. 
Epstein complains, for example, about the fundamental premise of this case: that Jane Doe 
is a "crime victim" covered by the Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA). Epstein argues that this 
is not possible, because there are no pending federal charges against Epstein in this District. But 
this Court has already cited evidence and explained the reasons for concluding that Jane Doe 1 
was a victim of a federal crime committed by Epstein in the Southern District of Florida. 359 
F.Supp.3d at 1204. If Epstein wanted to challenge that finding, all he had to do was file an 
affidavit, under oath, to that effect. He chose not to do so — and due process hardly precludes 
continuing to move forward in this case on the basis of an unchallenged and factually supported 
finding made long ago. 
Moreover, if taken seriously, Epstein's position would sap the CVRA of much of its value. 
This Court has already held that exercising CVRA rights is possible before criminal charges are 
formally filed, noting that 18 U.S.C. § 3771(d)(3) provides that "the CVRA's enumerated rights 
`shall be asserted in the district court in which a defendant is being prosecuted for the crime or, if 
no prosecution is underway, in the district court in the district in which the crime occurred.'" Does 
v. United States, 817 F.Supp.2d 1337, 1342 (S.D. Fla. 2011) (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 377(d)(3) 
(emphasis added)). This Court explained that the CVRA's language allows CVRA's rights to "be 
enforced before a prosecution is underway . . ", id. (emphasis added) — i.e., to be "enforced" in 
this Court. Of course, the Crime Victims Rights Act creates rights for "crime victims," which in 
Epstein's (erroneous) view can never exist until a formal indictment is filed. Epstein's argument 
would essentially eviscerate the CVRA's pre-charging protections and should be rejected.

B. 
The Court's Findings About Epstein Counsel's Awareness of Concealment of 
the Non-Prosecution Agreement are Well-Supported and Unchallenged. 
1. 
Through Counsel, Epstein Was a Party to the Illegal Concealment of 
the Non-Prosecution Agreement. 
Intervenor Epstein also argues that his defense counsel "acted in good faith." Epstein 
Remedies Br. at 30. But he never defines what he means by "good faith." Rather than debating 
how to characterize the actions of the defense team, the salient factual issue is this Court's specific 
findings that the Government decided "to conceal the existence of the NPA and mislead the victims 
to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility." 359 F.Supp.3d at 1219. And the Court 
has also previously found that "Epstein's counsel was aware that the Office was deliberately 
keeping the NPA secret from the victims and, indeed, had sought assurances to that effect." Id. at 
1208 (citing DE 407 at ¶ 48 (emphasis added)). 
While Intervenor Epstein quibbles over the accuracy of these findings, one preliminary 
point is important: Epstein does not offer any factual evidence to the contrary. For instance, even 
though this Court invited Epstein to provide any affidavits or declarations in support of his position 
(DE 454 at 2), Epstein offered nothing. Nor did Epstein challenge the admissibility of evidence 
that Jane Doe 1 and 2 have previously provided. As a result, in attacking this finding, Epstein can 
only rely on the existing evidence. 
Epstein's main point appears to be not that this Court was wrong in finding that the NPA 
was concealed from the victims through misleading statements, but rather that this Court was 
technically incorrect about when the concealment began. Thus, Epstein argues (in bold face type) 
that "nowhere in the record is there any evidence that Mr. Epstein's counsel, prior to September 
EFTA00021454
--- PAGE 14 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 14 of 70 
24, 2007, urged the government not to consult with [the victims] about the government's 
intentions." Epstein Remedies Br. at 31 (emphasis reorganized). 
The Court will immediately notice the hedged and negative proposition that Epstein 
defends — i.e., Epstein does not argue that the Court's conclusion about concealment is somehow 
incorrect but merely that no record evidence exists to prove the point. But record evidence 
obviously demonstrates that Epstein and his lawyers signed the NPA, which itself provided that 
"[t]he parties anticipate that this agreement will not be made part of any public record. If the 
United States received a Freedom of Information Act request or any compulsory process 
commanding the disclosure of the agreement, it will provide notice to Epstein before making that 
disclosure." NPA at I 13 (emphasis added). This Court noted this provision as part of its factual 
findings. 359 F.Supp.3d at 1208. The NPA's plain language thus makes clear both that Epstein 
knew the NPA was being concealed and, by requiring that notice go to him before disclosure, that 
it was at Epstein's insistence that this provision is included. After all, the Government would have 
no reason to bind itself to an undertaking to provide special notice to Epstein. 
Perhaps recognizing that is difficult to contest that he sought the concealment provision, 
Epstein quickly falls back to the position that his lawyers "never conditioned his agreement to the 
NPA on non-disclosure to victims of the intended resolution." Epstein Remedies Br. at 31. To be 
sure, it may be impossible to say exactly how the negotiations proceeded and what was a vital 
"condition" for either side. Many of the important details were hammered out in unrecorded, face-
to-face meetings between prosecutors and defense attorneys. And for reasons that Epstein never 
explains, his attorneys were discussing with prosecutors how to meet "off campus" to finalize the 
agreement. See DE 361 at 14 (line prosecutor writes to defense counsel that "Maybe we can set 
EFTA00021455
--- PAGE 15 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 15 of 70 
a time to meet. If you want to meet `off campus' somewhere, that is fine"). Indeed, the 
documentary evidence in this case makes clear that at least one additional meeting was held off 
campus between the Government and Epstein. Id. 
But while the Court may never know precisely what Epstein "conditioned" his agreement 
on, it is quite reasonable to conclude that Epstein was "seeking assurances" that the agreement 
would not be disclosed — or, at the very least, not disclosed without an opportunity for him to 
object. Indeed, the record makes clear that it was Epstein's lawyers who first asked about whether 
the NPA would be made public. DE 361 at 15. And, as the NPA was being executed, defense 
counsel followed up again with the line prosecutor, specifically requesting that she "do whatever 
you can to keep [the NPA] from becoming public." 359 F.Supp.3d at 1207. 
Moreover, even before the NPA was signed, uncontested documentary evidence shows that 
Epstein was working to conceal what happened from the victims. For example, as the Court noted 
in its findings, the line prosecutor and Epstein's counsel were working together to "avoid the 
press." 359 F.Supp.3d at 1206. These documents pertain to events before the NPA was executed 
on September 24, 2007, proving that Epstein's defense attorneys sought to have the NPA 
concealed in advance of its signing. Given that concealment of the NPA necessarily meant that 
the victims were being denied their right to confer, Epstein clearly became a party to the CVRA 
violation even before the NPA was executed. 
But it is hardly necessary to the Court's CVRA findings that Epstein have been involved 
in concealing the NPA before it was signed. The NPA was not actually consummated until months 
later, in June 2008. And by being party to — and surely instigator of— that extended concealment, 
Epstein was responsible for the CVRA violations. 
EFTA00021456

Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 16 of 70 
If there is any doubt on this point, it only reinforces the victims' motion that it should 
receive all records associated with the negotiations, including information about the Government's 
deliberations. Given that both the Government and now Epstein are making representations about 
what occurred during the negotiations, there is every reason for finding a waiver of work product 
and other protections, and a compelling need for disclosing all documents about what happened. 
See generally Jane Doe 1 and 2's Motion for Finding of Waiver of Work Product and Similar 
Protections and for Production of Documents, DE 414 (currently pending before the Court per DE 
464 at 14).3
Epstein also points to internal Justice Department regulations, arguing that they show that 
the CVRA was technically inapplicable in this case. Epstein Remedies Br. at 21. But to the extent 
that those guidelines failed to extend victims' rights during the pre-charging process, those 
guidelines were simply illegal — as this Court ruled long ago. Does v. United States, 817 F.Supp.2d 
1337, 1341 (S.D. Fla. 2011). 
Epstein also fails to fully describe what the Justice Department regulations required the 
Justice Department to do during the investigative stage of a case. The 2005 Attorney General 
Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance (hereinafter "2005 A.G. Victim Guidelines") to 
which he refers required the FBI to "provide the victim with the earliest possible notice concerning 
the status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent that it is appropriate and will not interfere 
In an effort to comply with the Court's scheduling order — and to provide consolidated 
briefing — Jane Doe 1 and 2 have not filed a separately docketed motion for production of the 
materials, instead explaining in their briefs the grounds for production. If the Court believes that 
a separate motion is necessary to raise this issue, Jane Doe 1 and 2 would respectfully request 
leave be permitted to rapidly file such a motion. 
A full copy of the 2005 Guidelines is available in Justice Department archives at 
https://www.justice.govisites/default/files/olp/docs/ag_guidelines2012.pdf. 
EFTA00021457
--- PAGE 17 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 17 of 70 
with the investigation." 2005 A.G. Victim Guidelines at p. 25, Part IV.A.3.a.3 (citing 42 U.S.C. 
§ 10607(c)(3)A)5) (emphasis added)). Presumably, this requirement that the FBI keep victims 
informed is why Epstein and the prosecutors were discussing meeting privately "off campus," as 
a normal "on campus" meeting would have involved FBI agents and others Justice Department 
employees (e.g., victim-witness coordinators) who would have been obligated by these regulations 
to provide Epstein's victims with more information about what was happening. 
Epstein also refers to a 2010 opinion of the Justice Department's Office of Legal (OLC), 
which concluded that the CVRA did not extend rights until the filing of formal charges. Epstein 
Remedies Br. at 32. Of course, the OLC opinion did not exist in 2007-08, when USAO-SDFL and 
Epstein were concealing the NPA. Moreover, it is unsurprising to find that the Justice Department 
would be staking out a very narrow (but unsupportable) position on its legal obligations under the 
law. Cf. Paul G. Cassell, Nathanael J. Mitchell & Bradley J. Edwards, Applying the Crime Victims' 
Rights Act Before Criminal Charges are Filed, 104 J. CRIM. L. & CRIMINOLOGY 59, 76-77 (2014) 
("OLC's analysis is unpersuasive."). 
But this debate over legal application of the CVRA in pre-charging situations is ultimately 
wide of the mark as an attack on the Court's findings regarding the CVRA violation here. The 
USAO-SDFL had made its own determination that the CVRA did, indeed, apply in this case — and 
was telling victims that they had CVRA rights well before the NPA was ever signed. As this Court 
has previously found, as early as March 2007, the USAO-SDFL sent official notices to Epstein 
victims informing them that they had rights under the CVRA. For example, on about June 7, 2007, 
This statute has since been superseded by other victim enactments and has accordingly 
been repealed. 
EFTA00021458
--- PAGE 18 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 18 of 70 
FBI agents delivered a standard CVRA notification letter to Jane Doe 1. 359 F.Supp.2d at 1205. 
In this letter, the USAO-SDFL promised that it would "make its `best efforts' to protect Jane Doe 
l's [CVRA] rights, including `the reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the United States 
in the case 
..'" Id. Jane Doe 1 "relied on those representations and believed that the government 
would protect those rights and keep her informed about the progress of the case." Id. Nowhere in 
his response does Epstein claim that his counsel were unaware of this approach. 
This issue about the Justice Department's guidelines has already been evaluated by this 
Court. As this Court explained in granting summary judgment: 
Nor did the Justice Department guidelines create an exemption from the CRVA's 
statutory requirements. Although the Government points to guidelines that 
conflicted with the requirements of the CVRA (by restricting CVRA rights until 
after a formal indictment), the Court is not persuaded that the guidelines were the 
basis for the Government's decision to withhold information about the NPA from 
the victims. If that had been the case, the Government would not have sent the 
victim letters telling them that they had rights protected under the CVRA. Nor 
would they have told Epstein's attorneys that it had obligations to notify the 
victims. In any event, an agency's own "'interpretation' of a statute cannot 
supersede the language chosen by Congress." Mohasco Corp. v. Silver, 447 U.S. 
807, 825 (1980). 
Given that the USAO-SDFL had told the victims that the CVRA applied, it was obligated 
to confer with them and treat them fairly. Epstein does not argue (much less provide evidence) 
that his extensive legal team was unaware that the USAO-SDFL was following CVRA 
requirements. Thus, the record fully supports the conclusion that, through his many lawyers, 
Epstein was aware that the CVRA was in play and that, as a result of his pressure, the Government 
was not conferring with his victims. 
Even more important, Epstein cannot point to anything in Justice Department policy 
requiring that a non-prosecution agreement be concealed from victims, much less permitting 
EFTA00021459
--- PAGE 19 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 19 of 70 
prosecutors to mislead victims. While Epstein claims that he was simply asking USAO-SDFL to 
"follow its own national guidelines," Epstein Remedies Br. at 22, he was in fact asking for a clear 
departure from standard procedures. Indeed, the USAO-SDFL has admitted that "Epstein's 
counsel convinced the [Office] that (contrary to standard Government practice) Epstein should be 
permitted to provide input into any message being delivered, and ultimately that the victims should 
not be told anything `until after Epstein pleas.'" DE 361 at 5-6 (citing Exhibit 25) (emphasis 
added). 
And, as this Court has previously explained, "Particularly problematic was the 
Government's decision to conceal the existence of the NPA and mislead the victims to believe that 
federal prosecution was still a possibility. When the Government gives information to victims, it 
cannot be misleading." 359 F.Supp.3d at 1219. 
After the NPA was signed, Epstein concedes that he was involved in the notifications to 
victims. Thus, Epstein points to a letter sent by his counsel, on December 6, 2007, indicating that 
he did not object some form of notice being given to the alleged victims." Epstein Remedies Br. 
at 32 (citing DE 403-15:3). But as even a quick glance that letter makes clear, the "form of notice" 
that Epstein had in mind was very limited — indeed, Epstein's counsel was proposing that it merely 
be sent by the State Attorney and presumably would not mention the federal non-prosecution 
provisions. DE 403-15:3-4. Moreover, that same letter makes clear that Epstein was strenuously 
seeking an opportunity to review victim notices from the government. Id. at 3. Accordingly, when 
just a few weeks later the Government began circulating "misleading" notices, the record plainly 
supports the conclusion that Epstein had seen and approved the notices — and Epstein advances no 
argument (or evidence) to the contrary. 
EFTA00021460
--- PAGE 20 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 20 of 70 
Remarkably, despite all this evidence that Epstein was pressuring the USAO-SDFL not to 
discharge its statutory obligation to confer with the victims, Epstein attempts to claim that "federal 
law enforcement's decision to not [confer] with [the victims] was made, not for Mr. Epstein's 
benefit, but rather to protect their own prosecutorial interests." Epstein Remedies Br. at 23. The 
basis for this claim is selected excerpts from an affidavit of the line prosecutor. Id. (citing DE 403-
18). The fact that Epstein, joined by the USAO-SDFL, are both now using this affidavit discussing 
internal deliberations of the Office only confirms that work product and other protections have 
been waived over documents regarding those deliberations. See generally Jane Doe 1 and 2's 
Motion for Finding of Waiver of Work Product and Similar Protections and for Production of 
Documents, DE 414.6 Once again, the victims reassert their motion that they are entitled to see 
those documents, to be in position to challenge the USAO-SDFL's arguments about benign 
intentions — and now Epstein's similar claims. See DE 464 at 14 (reasserting DE 414). 
Moreover, Epstein fails to fully discuss what the line prosecutor's affidavit essentially 
admits. The affidavit only attempts to provide an explanation for failing to disclose the NPA's 
financial compensation provisions. See, e.g., DE 403-19 at 10-11 ¶ 21 (claiming that disclosure 
would have subjected victims to cross-examination). But the affidavit never explains why the 
most significant feature of the non-prosecution agreement was being concealed from the victims 
— i.e., the fact that the agreement would lead to Epstein's non-prosecution. As a result, through its 
Waiver by the Government is also further demonstrated by the press conference held by 
then-Labor Secretary R. Alexander Acosta on July 10, 2019. Before the Washington press corps 
and a global television audience, Acosta discussed the substance of the affidavit and deliberations 
by the USAO-SDFL on the case. See https://www.c-span.orgivideon462479-1/1abor-secretary-
defends-handling-epstein-plea-deal-amid-calls-resignation/. Indeed, the affidavit was part of the 
"press packet" Acosta handed out. 
EFTA00021461
--- PAGE 21 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 21 of 70 
silence, the affidavit concedes what is glaringly obvious: That due to Epstein's pressure, the 
USAO-SDFL was hiding from the victims that Epstein had already secured a signed agreement 
providing immunity from federal prosecution in Florida to him (and all "potential co-conspirators" 
for good measure). 
This Court has already discussed the point, noting that, in January 2008, when the USAO-
SDFL sent notices to the victims counseling "patience," the Office "had bound itself to the terms 
of the NPA unless Epstein failed to comply with the terms. It was a material omission for the 
Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to investigation about which 
it had already bound itself not to prosecute." 359 F.Supp.3d at 1221. Obviously, the notices to 
the victims could have been written differently to avoid a "material omission." But it was clearly 
due to Epstein's efforts that the immunity provisions were being concealed to avoid a firestorm of 
controversy that would have occurred if that fact was disclosed publicly. 
2. 
Evidence Exists that the Epstein Defense Team Acted in Bad Faith. 
Epstein further asserts that the existing "record conclusively refutes any bad faith" on the 
part of his counsel. Epstein Remedies Br. at 20. But the victims have also previously made well-
supported allegations of bad faith actions. In their summary judgment motion, for example, Jane 
Doe 1 and 2 alleged that on February I, 2007, the Epstein defense team sent a 24-page letter to the 
Office, which "falsely stated: `Epstein did not know or believe any women were under 18 years of 
age.' It also contained other deceptive factual and legal arguments about Epstein's culpability." 
DE 361 at 10 (citing Exhibit 43) (emphasis added). Jane Doe 1 and 2 further alleged that, on July 
6, 2007, Epstein's lawyers sent a 23-page letter to USAO-SDFL which "falsely claimed that `Mr. 
Epstein never targeted minors' . . . ." DE 361 at 11 (citing Exhibit 47) (emphasis added). Jane 
EFTA00021462
--- PAGE 22 ---
' Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 22 of 70 
Doe I and 2 also alleged that Epstein's lawyers were discussing with the prosecutors a disposition 
that would make it difficult for a judge to know what was really happening. DE 361 at 14 (citing 
Exhibit 7). And Jane Doe 1 and 2 also alleged that Epstein and government lawyers were using 
private, home e-mail address to conduct some of their discussions — and noted that no emails sent 
to or from any home c-email addresses of prosecutors has every been produced. DE 361 at 15. 
Jane Doe 1 and 2 reassert all of these thus-far uncontested factual claims and ask that the 
Court accept them as part of deciding the basis for crafting an appropriate remedy. Epstein has 
not challenged any of these facts proffered by Jane Doe 1 and 2. If Epstein wants this case to be 
decided based on how his legal team acted, he needs to provide affidavits or other evidence of its 
conduct — and he has not done so. 
Even more significantly with regard to the alleged "bad faith" of Epstein's defense team is

3. 
The USAO-SDFL Was Not Authorized to Extend Epstein Immunity 
Without First Conferring with his Victims. 
Epstein also argues that the NPA is "a legal agreement." Epstein Remedies Br. at 25. By 
this he apparently means that, if one looks merely at the four corners of the document, no provision 
is, on its face, illegal. But as Jane Doe 1 and 2 have explained earlier, it is well accepted that a 
contract or other agreement can be illegal based on the way in which it was formed. See Victims' 
Remedy Reply to the Gov't. DE 464 at 27. Indeed, the Eleventh Circuit has clearly held that the 
manner in which an agreement is formed can render an otherwise-valid agreement unenforceable. 
In San Pedro v. United States, 79 F.3d 1065 (11th Cir. 1996), the Eleventh Circuit held that in 
order for any provision in a plea agreement to be enforceable, "there must have been a valid, 
binding agreement in the first instance . . . 
Id. at 1068. In San Pedro, a defendant sought to 
block a deportation proceeding by immigration authorities, arguing that a promise by prosecutors 
of transactional immunity included a promise of nondeportation. Id. at 1067-68. In that case, as 
in this one, it could have been argued that a promise of nondeportation was "a legal agreement." 
But, nonetheless, the promise was unenforceable because, the Eleventh Circuit explained, the 
prosecutor who made the commitment was not authorized to do so. Id. at 1070. In particular, "the 
EFTA00021467
--- PAGE 27 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 27 of 70 
United States Attorney and the AUSAs who negotiated the plea agreement with San Pedro did not 
have the authority to promise that he would not be deported." Id. at 1072. 
So too here. Prosecutors were simply not authorized to offer Epstein immunity until they 
had conferred with Epstein's victims. Accordingly, the NPA's immunity provisions were not part 
of a "valid, binding agreement in the first instance." 79 F.3d at 1068. And thus, Epstein is not 
entitled to take advantage of the non-prosecution provisions, at least with respect to crimes against 
Jane Doe 1 and 2 and any other victim who desires to have him prosecuted. 
In their remedy briefing, Jane Doe 1 and 2 have asked for "partial" rescission of the 
immunity provisions — that is, rescission of the immunity provisions for only those victims who 
seek rescission. DE 464 at 17-30. In response, Epstein could have theoretically made an argument 
for the NPA's "total rescission." Indeed, the victims have previously discussed this issue in 
responding to the briefing of the USAO-SDFL, explaining that the Office itself lacked "standing" 
to advance a request for total rescission. Id. at 30. The victims then explained that Epstein would 
have standing to advance such a "total" rescission argument — if he wanted to. Id. And after this 
briefing — explicitly noting that Epstein would need to advance such an argument for total 
rescission — Epstein has not done so. 
Presumably the reason that Epstein is not asking for total rescission of his NPA with the 
USAO-SDFL is that it would eliminate what is reportedly his main defense to recent sex trafficking 
charges in the Southern District of New York — that somehow an agreement with the U.S. Attorney 
for the Southern District of Florida blocking prosecution in "this District" prevents federal 
prosecutors in New York from prosecuting crimes committed there. But the Court need not reach 
any conclusion about Epstein's motives for declining to ask for total rescission. In light of this

Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 28 of 70 
sequence of events, Epstein has clearly waived any right to seek total rescission of the NPA. And 
— as the victims predicted (DE 464 at 30-31) — the case as presented to this Court now boils down 
to either upholding an illegal agreement or partially rescinding it. 
Given the choice between the only two options presented to it (at least that this time12), this 
Court's duty is clear. Congress has instructed that "[i]n any court proceeding involving an offense 
against a crime victim, the court shall ensure that the crime victim is afforded the rights described 
in [the CVRA]." 18 U.S.C. § 3771(b)(1) (emphasis added). This Court also previously held that 
"[w]hile Epstein was within his rights to attempt to persuade higher authorities with the 
Department of Justice to overrule the prosecutorial decisions of the U.S. Attorney's Office in the 
Southern District of Florida, the CVRA was designed to give victims the same opportunity to 
attempt to affect prosecutorial decisions before they became final." 359 F.Supp.3d at 1221 
(emphasis added). While the victims have asked for partial rescission to give them the "same 
opportunity" that Epstein's high-powered legal team had to "attempt to affect prosecutorial 
decisions" in this District, Epstein fails to provide any other alternative. Thus, partial rescission 
of the NPA's immunity provisions is the only remedial option before the Court that comes close 
to permitting the Court to discharge its obligation to "ensure" that victims are afforded their rights. 
U.S.C. § 3771(b)(1). It is only after rescission of the immunity provisions pertaining to them 
that Jane Doe 1 and 2 will receive "the full unfettered exercise of their conferral rights at a time 
that will enable [them] to exercise those rights meaningfully." DE 189 at 9 (citing U.S. v. BP 
Products North America, Inc., 2008 WL 501321 at *14 (S.D. Tex. 2008)); see also Kenna v. United 
Jane Doe 1 and 2 continue to assert their position that, if partial rescission is not possible 
for some reason, then total rescission is required. DE 464 at 30-36.

States District Court, 435 F.3d 1011, 1017 (9th Cir. 2006) (when trial court denied a victim his 
right to give a statement at the defendant's sentencing, the trial court must be "cognizant that the 
only way to give effect to [the victim's] right to speak . . . is to vacate the sentence and hold a new 
sentencing hearing"). Any other conclusion would require the Court to approve the illegal bargain 
struck by Epstein and the USAO-SDFL. After the passage of the CVRA, the Court is simply not 
permitted to approve a violation of crime victims' rights. 
II. 
THE CVRA AUTHORIZES RESCISSION AS A REMEDY. 
Intervenor Epstein next argues that the "CVRA itself' precludes a rescission remedy. 
Epstein Remedies Br. at 27-33. The Court has already ruled to the contrary, and nothing in 
Epstein's legal arguments should cause the Court to reverse course. 
A. 
The CVRA Authorizes Rescission as a Remedy. 
Intervenor Epstein's first argument is a purely legal argument — that the CVRA's plain 
language somehow restricts the Court from rescinding provisions in the NPA as a remedy in this 
case. But Epstein's argument ultimately boils down to the proposition that a provision that 
contains a limitation on a victim making "a motion to re-open a plea or sentence" (18 U.S.C. § 
3771 (d)(5) (emphasis added)) somehow restricts the ability of a victim to make a motion regarding 
a right to confer regarding a non-prosecution agreement. To the contrary, as this Court has held, 
the fact that the CVRA permits re-opening of pleas and sentences in some circumstances, fully 
confirms that a non-prosecution agreement can likewise be reopened. Moreover, in attempting to 
apply the limitations contained in § 3771(d)(5), Epstein quickly produces a non-sequitur. The 
limitations he cites apply during a court "proceeding" — i.e., the victim must have asserted "the 
right to be heard before or during the proceeding at issue." An NPA can be drafted and signed 
EFTA00021470
--- PAGE 30 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 30 of 70 
before any "proceeding" is held. It is for this reason that the CVRA (as it existed in 2007-0813) 
required an objection during a "proceeding" as a prerequisite to re-opening a plea or sentence — 
but not for an NPA. 
Moreover, distinguishing between a non-prosecution agreement (negotiated outside of the 
court processes) and "plea" and "sentence" makes considerable sense. As this Court explained, 
an "NPA entered into without notice has a more damaging impact on victims than a plea agreement 
entered into without notice. When a plea agreement is entered into without notice, the victim will 
at least have an opportunity to provide input to a judge at sentencing. Once an NPA is entered into 
without notice, the matter is closed and the victims have no opportunity to be heard regarding any 
aspect of the case." 359 F.Supp.3d at 1220 n.7 (emphasis added). 
Unable to provide a logical explanation for his position, Epstein claims that two CVRA 
appellate decisions support him. But both decisions dealt with a separate issue — whether crime 
victims seeking to overturn a district court decision denying enforcement of their rights in appellate 
courts had to shoulder the heavy burden traditionally associated with the "mandamus" relief. See 
U.S. v. Monzel, 641 F.3d 58, 532-33 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (discussing 18 U.S.C. § 3771(d)(3) and 
holding crime victims had to satisfy high mandamus standards); United States v. Hunter, 548 F.3d 
1308, 1315 (10th Cir. 2008) (same). Interestingly, Congress has since essentially overruled both 
of those decisions. See 18 U.S.C. § 3771(d)(3) (2015 amendment) (making clear that crime victims 
Aware of the Government and Epstein's secret maneuvering in this case, in 2015 
Congress amended the CVRA in order to codify this Court's earlier rulings here and ensure that 
victims received timely notice of any NPA. 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(9). In codifying this right, it 
would be hard to imagine that Congress wanted to create for victims a hollow right — one that 
could never be enforced in any way — which is the logical implication of Epstein's position.

--- PAGE 31 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 31 of 70 
need only satisfy "ordinary" standards of appellate review). But, in any event, these decisions 
discussing appellate issues provide no useful guidance here. 
B. 
The Victims Are Not Time-Barred Under the CVRA. 
Intervenor Epstein also argues that rescission relief is somehow "time-barred." Epstein 
Remedies Br. at 40. Epstein relies upon a provision in the CVRA that states that "[t]he district 
court shall take up and decide any motion asserting a victim's right forthwith." DE 463 at 40 
(citing 18 U.S.C. § 3771(d)(3) (emphasis added)). Epstein, however, has waived any right to 
complain about delay in this case. The Court will recall that back in 2013, Epstein and his lawyers 
tried to assert an alleged "plea negotiation" privilege over various documents. After this Court 
denied their assertion (DE 188) — and denied their motion for a stay pending appeal (DE 206) — 
Epstein and his lawyers succeeded in obtaining an Eleventh Circuit stay of proceedings in this case 
for months. They represented to the Eleventh Circuit that "[t]here will be no prejudice to [the 
victims] from waiting until an appellate court can address the critically important issues at stake 
here." Motion for Stay Pending Appeal, Jane Does v. United States, No. 13-12923 (11th Cir. July 
12, 2013). Having declined to raise — either with this Court or the appellate court — any need for 
a "forthwith" ruling then, Epstein cannot belatedly raise such a claim years later. 
In any event, relief in this case is not time barred. The CVRA's provision requiring this 
Court to "take up and decide any motion asserting a victim's right forthwith," 18 U.S.C. § 
3771(d)(3), is undoubtedly designed to ensure that victims can obtain immediate relief when they 
need it. For example, if a trial is taking place without the presence of the victim, a victim might 
require immediate relief, as otherwise any opportunity for the victim to attend might permanently 
disappear. Cf 18 U.S.C. § 3771(d)(5) (a victim cannot obtain the remedy of a "new trial").

Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 32 of 70 
In this case, this Court acted expeditiously and did take up and decide Jane Doe 1 petition 
(later joined by Jane Doe 2) within just four days of its filing. On July 7, 2008, when counsel for 
Jane Doe I began to learn that a secret, non-prosecution agreement might be in the works, they 
filed an "emergency" petition for enforcement of the Crime Victims' Rights Act. DE 1. Two days 
later, on July 9, 2008, the USAO-SDFL responded. And just two days later, on the morning of 
July 11, 2008, this Court held a hearing. 
During the hearing, victims' counsel discussed what he understood to be a plea deal of 
some sort that was then under negotiation. As counsel explained: "it is my understanding and 
belief that the agreement with the federal government and with the U.S. Attorney's Office wasn't 
signed on that day [i.e., June 30, 2008]. So it is still my belief, I could be wrong, but that that 
agreement hasn't been completed as of this time." See Tr. (July 11, 2008) at 5-6 (emphasis added). 
Victims' counsel went on to say that, if the Court were make the assumption that an agreement 
had already been reached, then the Court should "[o]rder that the agreement that was negotiated is 
invalid and it is illegal as it did not pertain to [or uphold] the rights of the victim[s]." Id. at 6. 
Thereafter, the Government disclosed that it had, in fact, reached a secret agreement with Epstein 
months earlier. Id. at 8. 
Victims counsel then pushed to have the agreement invalidated. The Court explored the 
posture of the case, deciding that the issues no longer required any "emergency" treatment because 
Epstein had entered into the NPA long ago: 
THE COURT: In view of the fact that this agreement has already been 
consummated, and you want me to set it aside, as opposed to something that's about 
to occur, would you agree that-- and I have done this very quickly because of the 
petition and your allegation that something was about to happen. I'm not blaming 
you. 
MR. EDWARDS: I was mistaken. 
EFTA00021473
--- PAGE 33 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 33 of 70 
THE COURT: I'm not blaming you for doing that. In view of what you 
know now, is there any need to treat this as an emergency that has to be decided by 
tomorrow? 
MR. EDWARDS: I can't think of any reason in light of what we just heard 
[i.e., that the NPA had been signed eight or nine months earlier]. 
THE COURT: Mr. Lee, do you have anything else you wanted to add? Does 
either side think I need to take evidence about anything? If I do, since this is not an 
emergency anymore, I can probably find a more convenient time to do that. I don't 
have the time today to take evidence. But if you do believe that I should take 
evidence on this issue. 
MR. EDWARDS: It may be best if I conferred with the U.S. Attorney's 
Office on that and we can make a decision whether it is necessary or whether Your 
Honor deemed it was necessary for you to make a decision. 
THE COURT: I want to know what your respective positions are because it 
may be something in terms of having a complete record, and this is going to be an 
issue that's is going to go to the Eleventh Circuit, [it] may be better to have a 
complete record as to what your position is and the government's is as to what 
actions were taken. . . . And because it is not an emergency, I don't have to do 
something quickly, we can play it by ear and make this into a more complete record 
for the court of appeals. 
See Tr. (July 11, 2008) at 25-26. 
As this recitation of events makes clear, the Court fully discharged its duty to "take up and 
decide" a victim's motion "forthwith." Acting quickly, the Court held a hearing less than four 
days after the petition was filed and decided, with the agreement of both parties to the action (i.e., 
Jane Doe 1 and 2 and the USAO-SDFL) that the appropriate course of action was to develop a full 
evidentiary record of the events surrounding the NPA and whether the victims were entitled to 
invalidation of the agreement secretly reached months earlier. 
Given his vast resources, Epstein was likely aware that all this was happening that same 
day. In any event, the record is clear that the USAO-SDFL quickly notified Epstein of these 
proceedings, because disclosure of Epstein's then-secret NPA was involved. Id. at 30. As noted 
above, the NPA directly provided that, if the USAO-SDFL was going to disclose the agreement, 
it was required to "provide notice to Epstein before making that disclosure." NPA at p. 5 ¶ 13. 
EFTA00021474
--- PAGE 34 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 34 of 70 
So if Epstein had thought that, after July 11, 2008, some quicker resolution of the matter was 
required, he was certainly free to press this point. He made no such argument — which must be 
regarded as a deliberate waiver of any right to a more rapid decision that he may have had. To be 
sure, Epstein was serving his jail sentence at that time. But issues surrounding unwinding a 
sentence were always going to exist in this case after Epstein pled guilty on June 30, 2008, because 
his jail sentence started then. Having these issues decided more quickly was something that 
Epstein could have sought — but did not. 
After setting an initial hearing within four days of the petition's filing, the Court continued 
move this case along, setting a hearing on August 25, 2008, to resolve the issue of whether the 
NPA would be turned over to the victims. During the hearing, the USAO-SDFL put on the record 
that they had notified Epstein of the proceedings. Tr. (Aug. 25, 2008) at 8. Epstein, however, did 
not ask to formally participate in the hearing. Nor did he ask to have the issues under litigation — 
including potential invalidation of the NPA — be decided more rapidly. The Court made further 
decisions about how best to proceed, including ordering disclosure of the secret NPA to the 
victims. 14
Thereafter, of course, extended litigation has ensued in this case. A good summary of the 
events between August 2008 and October 2010 is found in Docket Entry 41, in which Jane Doe 1 
and 2 explained that during the summer of 2008, they had been told by the Government that it 
would work with the victims to put together an agreed stipulation of facts. The victims then 
During the hearing, victims' counsel speculated that rescission of the NPA might not be 
in the victims' best interests. DE 27 at 4. Of course, that statement was made before counsel had 
even seen the entire NPA — and after the document's release, counsel moved forward seeking 
rescission. 
EFTA00021475
--- PAGE 35 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 35 of 70 
provided a set of facts, after which the Government reversed course and decided that it did not 
want to discuss what had happened. See DE 41 at 2-3 (citing DE 19 at 2). Because of the 
Government's decision not to work with Jane Doe 1 and 2 to develop a factual record, the victims 
had to attempt to secure that information from other sources — an effort that proved to be an arduous 
process. DE 41 at 3. Ultimately, on June 30, 2010, Jane Doe 1 and 2 were able to secure some 
correspondence between Epstein and the Government regarding the NPA's negotiation — 
correspondence proving that there "had been an orchestrated decision to deny them their rights." 
DE 41 at 1; see also DE 39 at 3-4. And thereafter in this case, the USAO-SDFL (and Epstein in 
some instances) proceeded to raise one objection after another, producing years of delay. 
While Epstein was obviously aware of this case — and that the ultimate objective was 
(among other things) invalidation of the NPA — he did not move to intervene in the case until 
September 2, 2011 (DE 93), and even then he sought only "limited" intervention with regard to 
remedy. 
In arguing that relief for the victims is now somehow "time-barred," Epstein refers to the 
effects of "missing a deadline." DE 463 at 42. In this case, the victims have missed no deadline. 
As soon as they had an inkling about a secret plea deal, Jane Doe 1 and 2 filed an emergency 
petition for review. And this Court has missed no deadline. It held a hearing on the initial petition 
in less than four days and took up and decided how the victims' petition would be handled. 
Thereafter, the proceedings unfolded in accordance with scheduling sought by the two parties. 
And Epstein has never raised a peep about any of this scheduling — until his filing two weeks ago. 
Moreover, it is more than a little ironic to see Epstein complaining that issues regarding 
the NPA have not been resolved more quickly. Of course, it was Epstein himself who set in motion 
EFTA00021476
--- PAGE 36 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 36 of 70 
all the events designed to keep the NPA concealed from the victims. If he had not persuaded the 
Government to deviate from its standard practice of keeping victims fully informed, all the issues 
surrounding the NPA could have been presented before he pled guilty in state court. Of course, it 
was precisely to keep that court — and the victims - from learning about the NPA that Epstein 
arranged to have the NPA shrouded in secrecy. Any passage of time in litigating these issues is 
directly attributable to Epstein's maneuverings. 
Finally, even if the Court were to conclude that somehow the "forthwith" deadline in this 
case had been missed, that fact would not allow it to refuse to enforce Jane Doe 1 and 2's CVRA 
rights now. The U.S. Supreme Court has explored a similar question of a missed deadline in 
connection with restitution for crime victims. Dolan v. United States, 560 U.S. 605 (2010), 
involved the effect of a district court missing a 90-day deadline for awarding restitution. Dolan 
held that the restitution statute's primary purpose was "to ensure that victims of a crime receive 
full restitution." Id. at 612. In setting a 90-day requirement, "the statute seeks speed primarily to 
help the victims of crime and only secondarily to help the defendant." Id. at 613. 
Of course, in this case, precisely the same focus on victims exists. Naturally, the purpose 
of the Crime Victims' Rights Act is to help crime victims. And the reason Congress required that 
rulings should be "forthwith" was to help victims. As Senator Kyl explained, "[t]he enforcement 
provisions of this bill ensure that never again are victim's rights provided in word but not in 
reality." 150 Cong. Rec. S4260-01 (Apr. 22, 2004). It would invert the purposes of the statute to 
allow a criminal like Epstein to take advantage of a "forthwith" enforcement provision added to 
help victims. And, indeed, the CVRA blocks his attempt, providing that "[a] person accused of 
EFTA00021477
--- PAGE 37 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 37 of 70 
the crime may not obtain any font: of relief under this chapter." 18 U.S.C. § 3771(d)(1) (emphasis 
added). 
Finally, to the extent that the "forthwith" provision has some application to Epstein, he 
could have brought that claim to the attention of this Court long ago. As the Supreme Court noted 
in connection with the 90-day requirement in Dolan, a defendant who is worried about the need 
for prompt action "can usually avoid additional delay simply by pointing to the statute and asking 
the court to grant a timely hearing." 560 U.S. at 616. The same thing is true in this case. Epstein 
could have, at any time, simply pointed to the "forthwith" provision and asked for a quick hearing. 
He did not do so. As in Dolan, reading the CVRA to require Epstein to have raise this argument 
imposes on him only a "small cost" relative "to the prospect of depriving innocent crime victims" 
of their CVRA rights. Id. 
III. 
PRINCIPLES OF CONTRACT LAW SUPPORT A RESCISSION REMEDY. 
Intervenor Epstein next argues that "principles of contract law" preclude a rescission 
remedy to enforce the victims' CVRA rights. Epstein's Remedy Br. at 33-36. The USAO-SDFL 
had raised a similar contract law argument and, to avoid duplicative briefing, Jane Doe 1 and 2 
simply incorporate by reference their previous responses. DE 464 at 19-26. But a few additional 
words are appropriate in response to Epstein's specific claims. 
A. 
Under the CVRA, Contract Law Principles Require Rescission. 
Epstein begins by citing a series of Florida state law cases. Epstein Remedies Br. at 33-
34. But Epstein never provides the legal predicate for his argument — that is, why this Court should 
decide this case under Florida contact law. To the contrary, this case is controlled by an Act of 
Congress, setting out federally protected rights for crime victims. In the Crime Victims' Rights 
EFTA00021478
--- PAGE 38 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 38 of 70 
Act, Congress has directed that this Court "shall ensure" that victims' CVRA rights are fully 
protected. 18 U.S.C. § 3771(b)(1). Even if Florida contract law were to the contrary (a point Jane 
Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2 disprove below), the only way this Court can "ensure" the protection of Jane 
Doe 1 and 2's right to confer about prosecuting Epstein's (and his coconspirators') sex crimes in 
the Southern District of Florida is to rescind the immunity provisions. As this Court has explained, 
rescission of these provision is required so that the victims can have "the full unfettered exercise 
of their conferral rights at a time that will enable the victims to exercise those rights meaningfully." 
DE 189 at 9. 
Congress did not expect that victims' rights might be stripped away through contract law 
principles. To the contrary, as Senator Kyl explained, "it is the clear intent and expectation of 
Congress that the district . . . courts will establish procedures that will allow for a prompt 
adjudication of any issues regarding the assertion of a victim's right, while giving meaning to the 
rights we establish." 150 Cong. Rec. 22953 (Oct. 9, 2004) (statement of Sen. Kyl) (emphases 
added). Accordingly, this Court's remedial task is not to ensure that the NPA conforms to ill-
defined contract law "principles" but rather to give meaning to the rights of victims to confer with 
the USAO-SDFL. To put it bluntly, a congressional command simply takes precedence over any 
"principles" of contract law that Epstein can cite. 
But if anything, standard contract law principles support Jane Doe 1 and 2's request for a 
rescission remedy. This Court has held that "[p]ublic policy empowers this Court to decline 
enforcement of a contract" that is contrary to law. Neiman v. Provident Life & Accident Ins. Co., 
217 F.Supp.2d 1281, 1286 (S.D. Fla. 2002) (citing United Papenvorkers Intl Union v. Misco, 
Inc., 484 U.S. 29, 42 (1987)). Thus, as this Court has explained, under "Florida law, a contract 
EFTA00021479
--- PAGE 39 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 39 of 70 
that violates public policy is void and unenforceable." Neiman, 217 F.Supp.2d at 1286 (citing 
Harris v. Gonzalez, M.D., 789 So.2d 405, 409 (Fla. 4th DCA 2001)). 
Here, the Court would violate "public policy" — indeed, an Act of Congress, i.e., the Crime 
Victims' Rights Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3771 — to uphold the NPA's immunity provisions, which prevent 
the victims from being able to exercise their CVRA right to confer with the USAO-SDFL. The 
public policy Congress announced in the CVRA invalidates practices whereby victims "were kept 
in the dark by prosecutors too busy to care ... and by a court system that simply did not have place 
for them." 150 Cong Rec. 7296 (April 22, 2004) (statement of Sen. Feinstein). The CVRA 
demands that the Court award a rescission remedy in response to the prosecutors and Epstein 
keeping the victims "in the dark." 
Intervenor Epstein complains that a rescission remedy would violate contract law, because 
rescission does not restore him to the "status quo." Epstein Remedies Br. at 34. After all, Epstein 
notes, he has now served his jail time under the agreement. Id. But it can equally be said that not 
imposing a rescission remedy fails to restore Jane Doe 1 and 2 to the "status quo" to which they 
were entitled. Under the CVRA, they were entitled to confer with the prosecutors before any 
immunity deal was struck with Epstein. The Court is thus faced with a choice — it can either protect 
Epstein's (illegally obtained) immunity deal; or it can give Jane Doe 1 and 2 (and other victims) 
the CVRA rights Congress has conferred on them. This Court must act to protect the statutorily 
protected rights of victims rather than ill-defined "principles" of contract law that Epstein finds 
useful. 
Epstein also contends that a rescission remedy is akin to "reformation of a contract," 
Epstein Remedies Br. at 45, and thus must "conform" to the intention of the parties to the NPA. 
EFTA00021480
--- PAGE 40 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 40 of 70 
But, of course, the NPA was affirmatively concealed from the victims. It is precisely because the 
NPA was clandestine that this Court must now rescind its immunity provisions. It was never the 
intention of the victims to extend immunity to Epstein. 
Thus, reformation principles are 
inapplicable. 
Epstein also rattles the sword that a rescission remedy would somehow imperil financial 
payments that he has previously made to his victims under the NPA. Epstein Remedies Br. at 34-
35. Many victims — including Jane Doe 1 and 2 — did not receive any financial benefits from the 
NPA. Instead, they negotiated other financial terms without relying on the NPA. So, Epstein 
would have no basis for seeking return of any moneys he paid them. But even with regard to 
victims who relied on the financial provisions of the NPA, the "partial" rescission remedy that 
Jane Doe 1 and 2 seek would not call into question Epstein's payments. The NPA's financial 
provisions can only be invalidated if someone asks for them to be invalidated. Jane Doe 1 and 2 
have not asked for that remedy. And neither did the USAO-SDFL, who would in any event lack 
"standing" to make such a request. See DE 464 at 27-28. Intervenor Epstein is the only party to 
the NPA who could ask for total rescission of the agreement — and he has declined to do.15 Thus, 
as noted above, the Court's choice is between either (1) affirming an illegal agreement or (2) 
rescinding provisions that block certain victims from being able to exercise their CVRA rights — 
the partial rescission remedy Jane Doe 1 and 2 lay out. Between those two choices, the Court must 
clearly act to protect the victims. Cf. Neiman, 217 F.Supp.2d at 1286 (refusing to enforce contract 
provision where doing so "would validate a ... [provision] founded in illegality"). 
" Epstein does refer, at one point, to the "government's view" that financial payments 
might be placed at risk through a rescission remedy. Epstein Remedies Br. at 35. But he never 
adopts that argument or ask this Court to adopt a "total rescission" remedy.

Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 41 of 70 
Once again, this conclusion is required by binding Eleventh Circuit case law. The Eleventh 
Circuit has instructed that in order for any provision in a plea agreement to be enforceable, "there 
must have been a valid, binding agreement in the first instance ...." San Pedro v. United States, 
F.3d 1065, 1068 (11th Cir. 1996). In this case, with respect to the NPA's immunity provisions, 
there never was a "valid, binding" agreement because the USAO-SDFL was not lawfully able to 
offer such an agreement. Under the CVRA, it had to first confer with the victims. 
On the other hand, with regard to the NPA's financial provisions, there was a "valid, 
binding" agreement that obligated Epstein to make payments to those victims who want the 
payment provisions enforced. The USAO-SDFL and Epstein were free to agree on those particular 
terms. And, to the extent contract law is relevant, there would clearly be consideration supporting 
those terms, since under the partial rescission that Jane Doe 1 and 2 propose, Epstein would still 
continue to have the right to immunity from prosecution in the Southern District of Florida for any 
victim who declined to ask for a rescission remedy.16 As a result, "consideration" for the contract 
(e.g., the NPA) would still exist, because something of value would exist for both sides. See 
RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACTS § 79.17
This argument assumes only that at least one of the dozens and dozens of Epstein Florida 
victims would not seek rescission of the immunity provision connected with her case. In the 
unlikely event that all of Epstein's victims unanimously demand rescission, then a different 
circumstance might arise. The Court could address those circumstances if they ever occurred. 
It may also be the case that Epstein retains some "consideration" for his NPA, because 
the statute of limitations may have now expired on some of the crimes covered by his NPA. The 
Court need not reach that issue, however, because other consideration exists. And Epstein's most 
serious crimes covered by the NPA — specifically, the sex trafficking charges — are not time barred, 
due to congressional extensions of the statutes of limitations. 
See 18 U.S.C. § 3299 
("Notwithstanding any other law, an indictment may be found . . at any time without limitation 
for any . . . felony under chapter 109A, 110 (except for section[s] 2257 and 2257A), or 117, or 
section 1591")).

Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 42 of 70 
Epstein also suggests that, if a partial rescission remedy is awarded, then he would be free 
to raise a "collateral attack" on his state court guilty plea. Epstein Remedies Br. at 46. Of course, 
whether he would be successful in doing so is dubious. Florida state courts take a dim view of 
belated challenges to guilty pleas. See, e.g., Guzman-Aviles v. State, 226 So. 3d 339, 346 (Fla. 5th 
DCA 2017) ("Every inroad on the concept of finality undermines confidence in the integrity of 
our procedure . . . .The impact is greatest when new grounds for setting aside guilty pleas are 
approved because the vast majority of criminal convictions result from such pleas. Moreover, the 
concern that unfair procedures may have resulted in the conviction of an innocent defendant is 
only rarely raised by a petition to set aside a guilty plea."). But any collateral attack would 
ultimately be an issue for the Florida state courts — not this Court. The only issue for this Court is 
whether to enforce the CVRA — and Congress has commanded that it must. 18 U.S.C. § 
3771(b)(1). And after rescission, given that prosecuting sex trafficking is a high priority of the 
Justice Department, we assume that the USAO-SDFL would quickly prosecute Epstein in this 
District on serious federal sex trafficking charges — charges that the victims could help explain to 
the prosecutors. DE 464 at 33-34. 
Epstein also argues that "the NPA is not a divisible agreement." Epstein Remedies Br. at 
46. But the NPA provision he cites does not say that. Instead, it simply provides that each of the 
NPA's provisions is "material" to the agreement and is supported "by independent consideration." 
NPA at p. 6. If Epstein had wanted an "indivisible" NPA (whatever that may mean), he was free 
to bargain for one. But nothing in the NPA's language provides that it is "indivisible." 
In any event, Jane Doe 1 and 2 are not arguing that the NPA is some sort of "divisible" 
agreement. Rather, their position is that the NPA's immunity provisions are unenforceable and 
EFTA00021483
--- PAGE 43 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 43 of 70 
must be rescinded. Epstein argues that the immunity provisions must be specifically enforced. 
But Florida law recognizes that "[s]pecific performance [of a contract] will be denied when the 
rights of innocent third parties have intervened so that enforcement of the contract would be harsh, 
oppressive, or unjust to them." Seaboard Oil Co. v. Donovan, 99 Fla. 1296, 1306, 128 So. 821, 
825 (1930) (citing 6 POMEROY EQUITY JURISPRUDENCE, § 794). Obviously, it is unjust to Jane 
Doe 1 and 2 to enforce immunity provisions in the NPA depriving them of congressionally 
guaranteed rights. 
Finally, Epstein never specifically asks this Court to rule that the NPA is "indivisible" and 
therefore must be declared void in its entirely. As noted above, the reason that Epstein has chosen 
not to ask for the NPA to be declared totally invalid is obvious — he apparently intends to try to 
use the NPA's immunity provisions in the Southern District of New York.18 But the key point 
remains that Epstein has waived any opportunity to ask for total rescission. The Court accordingly 
must choose between no rescission and partial rescission. The CVRA commands a choice in favor 
of the victims. 
B. 
The Civil Releases Signed by Jane Doe I and 2 Did Not — and Could Not —
Waive their CVRA Claims Against the Government. 
Intervenor Epstein next contends that Jane Doe 1 and 2 have somehow signed releases in 
a civil case that bar a rescission remedy in this criminal case. Epstein Remedies Br. at 37-38. His 
argument is specious. 
Equally obvious are the reasons why Epstein has declined to have the financial 
compensation provisions declared invalid. Doing so would expose him to compensatory and 
punitive damages claims that, for each victim, would be worth tens of millions of dollars. See DE 
464 at 34. 
EFTA00021484
--- PAGE 44 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 44 of 70 
Epstein points to civil releases signed by Jane Doe 1 and 2 that resolved their civil cases 
against Epstein. The terms of those releases plainly do not cover this case against the Government, 
seeking to enforce their rights in a criminal investigation. As Epstein's own exhibits makes clear, 
the release covers only claims for "compensatory or punitive damages": 
[Jane Doe] individually, and Jeffrey Epstein, individually (jointly referred 
to as "Parties"), enter into this Settlement Agreement and General Release 
("Settlement Agreement") in order to resolve the pending litigation against them as 
follows: 
2. 
General Release. 
[Jane Doe] and her agent(s), attomey(s), 
predecessor(s), successor(s) heir(s), administrator(s), and/or assign(s) (hereinafter 
"First Parties"), for and in consideration of the sum of [redacted] and other valuable 
consideration, received from or on behalf of Jeffrey Epstein and his agent(s), 
attomey(s), predecessor(s), successor(s), heir(s), administrator(s), assign(s) and/or 
employee(s) (hereinafter, "Second Parties"), the receipt whereof is hereby 
acknowledge, 
HEREBY remise, release, acquit, satisfy, and forever discharge the said 
Second Parties and any other person or entity would could have been included as a 
potential defendant ("Other Potential Defendants") from all, and all manner of, 
action and actions of [Jane Doe], including State or Federal, cause and causes of 
action (common law or statutory), suits, debts, dues, sum of money, accounts, 
reckoning, bonds, bills, specialties, covenants, contracts, controversies, 
agreements, promises, variances, trespasses, damages, judgments, executions, 
claims, and demands whatsoever in law or in equity for compensatory or punitive 
damages that said First Parties ever had or now have, or that any personal 
representative, successor, heir, or assign of said First Parties hereafter can, shall, or 
may have, against Jeffrey Epstein, or Other Potential Defendants, for, upon, or by 
reason of any matter, cause, or thing whatsoever (whether or known or unknown), 
from the beginning of the world to the day of this release. 
DE 463-4. While the release is lengthy, what is being released is clear: claims "for compensatory 
or punitive damages" against Epstein. Of course, this CVRA action does not seek any civil 
"damages" against Epstein (or anyone else, for that matter). Accordingly, the release's plain 
language makes clear it is inapplicable to this case. 
EFTA00021485
--- PAGE 45 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 45 of 70 
It is troubling that, in discussing this release, Epstein chooses to use ellipses to conceal the 
critical language about the release being limited to "compensatory or punitive damages." Thus, in 
Epstein's recounting of the tale, the general releases encompassed all "claims, and demands 
whatsoever in law or in equity ... for, upon, or by reasons of any matter, cause or thing whatsoever 
(whether known or unknown), from the beginning of the world to the day of this release." Epstein 
Remedies Br. at 47 (ellipses in original). Notice the ellipses — which remove the pivotal 
"compensatory or punitive damages" language. The Court should not permit such misleading 
briefing to carry the day. Cf. Loeffel Steel Prod., Inc. v. Delta Brands, Inc., 387 F. Supp. 2d 794, 
823 (N.D. Ill. 2005) ("ellipses are not a cure for misquotation and indeed are often the vehicle for 
misleading. See Posner, OVERCOMING LAW, 277 (1995) ("Beware a [lawyer] bearing ellipses.")). 
This CVRA rights enforcement action does not involve any claim for damages — much less, 
a claim for damages against Epstein.19 As Jane Doe 1 and 2 made clear in their initial remedies 
submission, they "are aware, of course, that the CVRA provides that it does not 'authorize a cause 
of action for damages.' 18 U.S.C. § 3771(d)(6). Accordingly, Jane Doe 1 and 2 are not seeking 
'damages' under the CVRA ...." DE 458 at 30 (emphasis added). 
Even if the this case is somehow interpreted to involve "damages," Florida courts have 
made clear that exculpatory clauses are only "enforceable where the intention to be relieved from 
liability was made clear and unequivocal and the wording was so clear and understandable that an 
ordinary and knowledgeable person will know what he or she is contracting away." Sanislo v. 
The release also extends to "Other Potential Defendants," defined as any "other person 
or entity would could have been included as a potential defendant" in the Jane Does lawsuit 
alleging sex abuse. Obviously, the United States was a not sex abuser and could not have been 
included in the lawsuit against Epstein.

Give Kids the World, Inc., 157 So.3d 256, 260-61 (Fla. 2015); see also Fresnedo v. Porky's Gym 
III, Inc., 271 So. 3d 1185, 1186 (Fla. 3d DCA 2019) (releases "that purport to deny an injured 
party the right to recover damages from another who negligently causes injury are strictly 
construed against the party seeking to be relieved of liability"); Diodato v. Islamorada Asset 
Mgmt., Inc., 138 So.3d 513, 517 (Fla. 3d DCA 2014) (reiterating the "well-settled principle that 
[exculpatory] clauses are disfavored and are narrowly construed"). 
As the beginning of the settlement agreement makes clear, "[Jane Doe] individually, and 
Jeffrey Epstein, individually (jointly referred to as "Parties"), enter into this Settlement Agreement 
and General Release ("Settlement Agreement") in order to resolve the pending litigation against 
them ... ." Of course, this CVRA case is not litigation between Jane Doe 1 and 2 and Epstein, but 
rather was (and is) styled as Jane Doe I and 2 v. United States. Thus, in the summer of 2010, 
Epstein was not a party to the CVRA case. He was not even an intervenor at that time. The general 
release that Jane Doe 1 and 2 entered into with Epstein did not apply — much less "clearly and 
unambiguously" apply — to this CVRA case against the United States. 
Confirming this understanding is the fact that, shortly after the civil cases settled, Jane Doe 
and 2 filed a statement with this Court explaining that the settlements of civil cases with Epstein 
in no way affected this CVRA action against the United States: 
The fact that Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 have settled their civil cases against sex 
offender Jeffrey Epstein in no way affects their determination to move forward with 
the above-captioned CVRA action against a different entity — the U.S. Attorney's 
Office for the Southern District of Florida. For reasons explained in their earlier 
pleadings, that Office grossly violated their rights under the Act. The fact that 
Epstein has settled with Jane Doe #1 and #2 to resolve his civil liability in no way 
exonerates the U.S. Attorney's Office for its failure to discharge its responsibilities 
under the Act. 
EFTA00021487
--- PAGE 47 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 47 of 70 
DE 39 at 2. Epstein never argued that this statement was inaccurate, presumably because he knew 
that was what the parties had agreed to. At the time of the settlements, Epstein was well aware of 
the CVRA action against the United States. He chose not to attempt to include that case in the 
release. 
For all these reasons, it is unambiguously clear that the civil release of their "damages" 
claims against Epstein does not bar Jane Doe 1 and 2 from proceeding with their CVRA claim 
against the United States, seeking to vindicate their CVRA rights. Indeed, even if the release had 
dismissed CVRA claims, such a provision would have been void as against public policy. Any 
such CVRA release would let a wealthy defendant (like Epstein20) buy his way out of prison. The 
CVRA applies only to criminal cases. Affluent criminal defendants should not be able to, first, 
illegally conceal an NPA in violation of crime victims' rights and then, second, simply payoff 
victims to avoid having justice done. 
Of course, that is not what happened in this case — as the releases to which Epstein refers 
simply do not cover the CVRA case. But even if they did, they would be obviously contrary to 
clearly announced public policy and unenforceable. As this Court has held, under "Florida law, a 
contract that violates public policy is void and unenforceable." Neiman v. Provident Life & 
Accident Ins. Co., 217 F.Supp.2d 1281, 1286 (S.D. Fla. 2002) (citing Harris v. Gonzalez, M.D., 
789 So.2d 405, 409 (Fla. 4th DCA 2001)). Public policy in Florida (and elsewhere) favors the

around the world, including in Manhattan, New York; Palm Beach, Florida; Stanley, New Mexico; 
and Paris, France." Letter from Gov't Regarding Bail, U.S. v. Epstein, No. 19-cr-490-RMB, DE 
(S.D.N.Y. July 8, 2019).

reporting of crimes — particularly crimes involving vulnerable child sex abuse victims. See, e.g., 
Valladares v. Bank of Am. Corp., 197 So.3d 1, 10 (Fla. 2016) ("Private citizens should be 
encouraged to become interested and involved in bringing the perpetrators of crime to justice . . . 
."). And, of course, Congress can articulate public policy. The articulated public policy in the 
CVRA is that this Court "shall ensure" that crime victims receive their rights. 18 U.S.C. § 
3771(b)(1). Construing the civil releases the way that Epstein would, obviously violates that 
announced policy of protecting crime victims and promoting prosecution of dangerous criminals. 
IV. 
THE DOCTRINES OF EQUITABLE AND JUDICIAL ESTOPPEL ARE 
INAPPLICABLE. 
Next, convicted sex offender Epstein asks that Court rule against his sex abuse victims 
under the "doctrine" of equitable and judicial estoppel. Epstein Remedies Br. at 3943. Epstein 
claims that Jane Doe 1 and 2 sought to enforce the terms of the NPA against him and, accordingly, 
"[p]rinciples of equitable and judicial estoppel" now somehow preclude them from enforcing the 
CVRA rights. Id. at 40. Epstein's estoppel arguments are meritless.21
A. Jane Doe I and 2 Have Not Violated Any CVRA Requirement in Handling Their 
Petition. 
Intervenor Epstein's first argument is hinges on the fact that the CVRA requires a judicial 
decision on a CVRA motion "forthwith." See id. at 40 (citing 18 U.S.C. § 3771(d)(3)). Epstein 
repeats his earlier argument, as discussed in Section II.B, supra, that Jane Doe 1 and 2 failed to 
obtain a decision "forthwith." But as discussed above, the "forthwith" requirement was fully 
satisfied in this case. The victims initially sought "emergency" relief and then this Court took 
It bears emphasizing that the USAO-SDFL has not raised any estoppel arguments. See 
DE 464 at 67-68. 
EFTA00021489
--- PAGE 49 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 49 of 70 
expeditious action in less than four days on the victims' motion. The CVRA contains no further 
time requirements, so the notion that victims somehow deviated from CVRA requirements is 
untrue. And, in any event, even assuming some sort of violation of the "forthwith" provision, 
Epstein is precluded from taking advantage of it. The CVRA itself provides that "[a] person 
accused of the crime may not obtain any form of relief under this chapter." 18 U.S.C. § 3771(d)(1) 
(emphasis added). 
Moreover, Epstein seems to suggest that the victims somehow, as he puts it, "stymied the 
operation of the CVRA." Epstein Remedies Br. at 40. But it was, of course, Epstein and the 
USAO-SDFL who, in the first instance, "stymied" the CVRA by illegally concealing their NPA. 
Since then, it has been a long and hard road for the victims — and the Court — to fully expose what 
happened. But that Epstein succeeded in keeping the truth concealed for so long provides no basis 
for withholding relief, particularly on alleged grounds of "equity." 
B. Congress Has Not Added Doctrines of Estoppel to the CVRA. 
Intervenor Epstein next resorts to what he describes as "doctrines" of "equitable" and 
"judicial" estoppel. These doctrines will be of some interest to courts sitting in equity. But this 
CVRA enforcement action is not an occasion where the Court is free to craft its own equitable 
rules restricting the CVRA. 
In the CVRA, Congress specifically directed that, when crime victims' issues come before 
a court, "the court shall ensure that the crime victim is afforded the rights described in [the 
CVRA]." 18 U.S.C. § 3771(b) (emphasis added). That mandatory language gives no room for the 
Court to ignore violations of crime victims' rights based on ill-defined notions of "estoppel." As 
the CVRA's legislative history makes clear, "It is not the intent of this bill that its significance be 
EFTA00021490
--- PAGE 50 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 50 of 70 
whittled down or marginalized by the courts . 
." 150 Cong. Rec. 54260-01 (Apr. 22, 2004) 
(statement of CVRA co-sponsor, Sen. Feinstein). Allowing a CVRA violation to go unremedied 
merely because a criminal can point to other competing estoppel considerations could not merely 
"whittle down" the CVRA but completely destroy its effectiveness in some cases. 
Controlling case law makes clear then when construing a remedial scheme for enforcement 
of congressionally created rights, the courts must give "appropriate judicial deference toward the 
will of Congress ...."Hardison v. Cohen, 375 F.3d 1262, 1264 (11th Cir. 2004) (internal quotation 
omitted). Congress is "in a better position to decide whether or not the public interest would be 
served" by expansive or narrow remedies. Id. at 1264. Indeed, where Congress has created a 
substantive right, the generally rule is that such a right "is not subject to equitable tolling or 
equitable estoppel." Fulghum v. Embarq Corp., 785 F.3d 395, 416 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 
136 S. Ct. 537 (2015). If notions of, for example, equitable estoppel are to become part of the 
CVRA, that choice is for Congress — not the courts. 
Moreover, if the Court is going to read into the CVRA doctrines of estoppel, it must also 
read in related defenses - such as the doctrine of "unclean hands." It is well-established that "[o]ne 
defense to the equitable claim of estoppel is the doctrine of `unclean hands!" Bird v. Centennial 
Ins. Co., 11 F.3d 228, 234 (1st Cir. 1993) (citing Peabody Gas & Oil Co. v. Standard Oil Co., 284 
Mass. 87, 187 N.E. 112, 113 (1933) ("[O]ne must come into a court of equity with clean hands in 
order to secure relief....")). Thus, "equity requires that those seeking its protection shall have acted 
fairly and without fraud or deceit as to the controversy in issue." Ellenburg v. Brockway, Inc., 763 
F.2d 1091, 1097 (9th Cir. 1985) (citing Johnson v. Yellow Cab Transit Co., 321 U.S. 383, 387 
(1944)). Here, Epstein — a sex offender who worked with the USAO-SDFL to illegally conceal an

NM from minor sex abuse victims — has unclean hands for multiple and obvious reasons — and 
thus is barred from raising estoppel arguments. 
C. 
Epstein Has Failed to Satisfy the Elements of the Equitable Estoppel 
Doctrine. 
In any event, even if some sort of equitable estoppel "doctrine" applied here, Epstein's 
equitable estoppel argument is meritless. Equitable estoppel precludes challenging a document 
only where that party "rel[ies] on the terms of the written agreement in asserting [her] claims." MS 
Dealer Service Corp. v. Franklin, 177 F.3d 942, 947 (11th Cir. 1999). Here, of course, Jane Doe 
I and 2 did not "rely" on the NPA's terms to establish a CVRA violation — in fact, they were 
challenging the terms. Thus, the basic elements of equitable estoppel are simply not in play. 
Moreover, because equitable estoppel requires close assessment of all relevant 
circumstances, it is important to understand the very limited reference the victims made to 
Epstein's NPA in their civil lawsuits. Jane Doe I and 2 filed their civil lawsuits in about September 
2008, only after their CVRA petition had been filed — and had succeeded in forcing the USAO-
SDFL to disclose the previously secret NPA. The victims' civil lawsuits briefly alleged that 
Epstein had agreed that he had sexually abused the various victims and was therefore estopped 
from denying the abuse. See DE 401-2 at 24 (quoting complaint). Of course, in September 2008, 
the CVRA petition had already been filed — but had not yet been finally decided, much less decided 
EFTA00021492
--- PAGE 52 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 52 of 70 
in their favor. Accordingly, the victims (acting through legal counsel) could only speculate as to 
the ultimate outcome of this CVRA case and had to preserve all possible arguments in their civil 
suit. But simply preserving a claim is not the same thing as actually prevailing on a claim — a 
necessary predicate for equitable estoppel. Ultimately, the civil suits that Epstein refers to were 
settled before trial and Epstein does not argue that any dispositive rulings were made against him 
based on the NPA. 
Any other conclusion would convert the equitable estoppel doctrine from one having 
limited scope to one having sweeping implications. Frequently litigants in the early stages of 
litigation must, to preserve their rights, assert multiple arguments that might ultimately prove to 
be inconsistent with positions either taken in the same case or in other litigation. It is only when a 
party actually receives a court ruling based on a particular predicate that estoppel issues even begin 
to come in to play. If the victims had obtained money from Epstein based on a court ruling that he 
was estopped from contesting liability to them by the NPA, then conceivably some of the 
prerequisites for equitable estoppel would have been in place. But until the victims moved for — 
and received — such a ruling, they did nothing more than preserve their rights by simply listing all 
possible arguments in their complaint. 
Preserving arguments is commonplace in modern litigation — not some basis for precluding 
later arguments. A plaintiff, for example, may allege in a complaint that she was harmed by either 
Defendant A or Defendant B — to be sorted out after further discovery. Or a defendant may allege 
that he did not harm the plaintiff but, if he did, the damages were only minimal. These are not 
occasions for equitable estoppel to apply, but simply the routine assertion of potentially diverging 
legal positions that protect the rights of a party. It would hardly be equitable to preclude parties, 
EFTA00021493
--- PAGE 53 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 53 of 70 
who in early stages of court proceedings raises all possible arguments, to somehow later become 
"estopped" from selecting among them. 
D. 
Epstein Has Failed to Satisfy the Elements of the Judicial Estoppel Doctrine. 
Intervenor Epstein also contends that the doctrine of "judicial estoppel" applies, blocking 
the victims from challenging the NPA. Epstein Remedies Br. at 41-42. Once again, his argument 
is meritless. 
For starters, for all the reasons just explained that Epstein's reliance on equitable estoppel 
doctrine fails, his judicial estoppel argument likewise fails. For example, the decision of whether 
to allow a doctrine of judicial estoppel to provide a basis for declining to enforce CVRA's rights 
is for Congress, not the courts. In addition, Epstein has "unclean hands" and cannot raise an 
argument sounding in equity. 
Remarkably, Epstein seeks to rely on this doctrine even though, under Eleventh Circuit 
caselaw, one of the foundational elements for applying the doctrine is proof of "a party's success 
in convincing a court of the earlier position, so that judicial acceptance of the inconsistent later 
position would create the perception that either the earlier or later court was misled." Tampa Bay 
Water v. HDR Engineering, Inc., 731 F.3d 1171, 1182 (11th Cir. 2013)). In this case, even treating 
the filing of a civil court complaint as an earlier "proceeding," Epstein does not even attempt to 
argue that Jane Doe 1 and 2 had "success" in convincing the courts that Epstein was estopped from 
contesting liability. The reason for this is that the victims never reached the point in the civil 
proceedings of making that argument against Epstein — much less, having success by winning the 
argument. Indeed, Epstein vigorously defended liability in those cases. The reason Epstein was 
able to fully contest liability is that the NPA created such a limited remedy for Epstein's victims

that it was, for all practical purposes, meaningless. Jane Doe 1 and 2 never sought summary 
judgment based on the NPA and instead looked forward to fully trying their cases. 
The relevant provision in the NPA is paragraph 9, which provided that if a victim elected 
to sue Epstein exclusively under 18 U.S.C. § 2255, Epstein agreed not to contest liability — "so 
long as the [victim] agrees to waive any other claim for damages, whether pursuant to state, federal, 
or common law." The practical effect of this provision was to cap the victims' claims against 
Epstein to no more than $150,000 (or, Epstein argued, no more than $50,000), the statutory 
maximum under § 2255. Given the horrific abuse that Epstein inflicted on his child sex abuse 
victims, this cap meant that the NPA was essentially meaningless for many of the victims — 
including Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2, who were unwilling to waive all other claims for damages 
and thus had to proceed entirely apart from the NPA to obtain appropriate damages. The victims 
thus never had "success" relying on the NPA's provisions — but could only have success by 
escaping from the limits on liability that the Government had agreed to with the sex offender they 
were pursuing. 
The Supreme Court has clearly held "[a]bsent success in a prior proceeding, a party's later 
inconsistent position introduces no risk of inconsistent court determinations and thus poses little 
threat to judicial integrity." New Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. 742,750-51 (2001). The victims 
never had "success" in arguing that Epstein was estopped from denying that he has abused the 
victims. Indeed, to the contrary, the victims pressed an argument that they were not limited to 
seeking damages under the NPA. Judicial estoppel is not applicable to this course of events. 
Citing a bankruptcy case, Epstein concedes the principles of judicial estoppel are very 
limited. Indeed, Epstein admits that, in bankniptcy proceedings, the Eleventh Circuit "employs a 
EFTA00021495

Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 55 of 70 
two-part test to guide district courts in applying judicial estoppel: whether (1) the party took an 
inconsistent position under oath in a separate proceeding, and (2) these inconsistent positions were 
calculated to make a mockery of the judicial system." Slater v. United States Steel Corp. 871 F.3d 
1174, 1181 (11th Cir. 2017) (internal quotation omitted). 
It should be remembered that Jane Doe 1 and 2 were confronting unprecedented secrecy 
and violation of a congressional statute in trying to determine how to proceed. But Epstein gamely 
argues that Jane Doe 1 and 2 made "a mockery of the judicial system [by] trying to convince one 
court to rule in their favor based on the binding validity of the NPA and then trying to convince 
this Court that the NPA was an `illegal agreement.' Epstein Remedies Br. at 52. Epstein never 
cites that specific document or argument in which Jane Doe 1 or 2 tried to somehow "convince 
one court to rule in their favor" based on the NPA — and, indeed, this Court in fact had an essentially 
identical case in front of it during the entire time where no such actions took place. See Doe v. 
Epstein, 9:08-cv-80893-KAM (S.D. Fla. 2009-10). The reason that Epstein is unable to cite any 
such example is that no such reliance on the NPA ever happened. For example, Jane Doe 1 and 2 
never moved for summary judgment on liability in their civil cases — they were looking forward 
to ultimately trying their case to a jury. And when they tried their cases to a jury, the victims 
intended to call witnesses and fully prove that Epstein had sexually abused them — and then to seek 
compensatory and punitive damages far in excess of what the NPA provided. No reliance on the 
NPA ever existed, much less the kind of improper behavior that would make a "mockery" of the 
system. 
Cf. Slater, 871 F.3d at 1178 (discussing deliberate concealment of claims from a 
bankruptcy court). 
EFTA00021496

Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 56 of 70 
Moreover, all of the actions in the CVRA case and the civil cases took place in public 
judicial proceedings in which Epstein was represented by a battery of lawyers. It "is difficult to 
impute an intent `to make a mockery of the judicial system' where the complaining party was 
aware of the inconsistency in sufficient time and in a position to properly raise an objection in the 
original proceeding." Ajaka v. Brooksamerica Mortg. Corp., 453 F.3d 1339, 1345 (11th Cir. 
2006). Here, Epstein and the Government was well aware of both this CVRA action and the related 
civil suits. There is no concealment or unfairness that are the hallmarks for applying judicial 
estoppel. Cf. Burnes v. Pemco Aeroplex, Inc., 291 F.3d 1282 (11th Cir. 2002) (applying doctrine 
in circumstances showing deliberate concealment of assets). 
Instead of presenting evidence (such as a court ruling) that Jane Doe 1 and 2 had "success" 
in relying on the NPA's provisions, Epstein appeals vaguely to the notion that Jane Doe 1 and 2 
"reaped for themselves the financial benefits of the NPA . . . ." Epstein's Remedies Br. at 42. 
What benefits? Jane Doe 1 and 2 settled their civil cases — and obtained benefits entirely apart 
from the NPA. The circumstances in which judicial estoppel would even potentially be in play 
did not occur. 
V. 
ALLEGED PRINCIPLES OF "SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS" DO NOT 
PRECLUDE RESCISSION REMEDIES. 
As his fifth argument against giving Jane Doe 1 and 2 their rights, Intervenor Epstein 
contends it would violate "principles of substantive due process" to rescind the NPA's immunity 
provisions. Epstein Remedies Br. at 43-45. In making his argument, Epstein cites run of the mill 
cases in which the issue is interpretation of a plea agreement. Of course, the Government must 
EFTA00021497
--- PAGE 57 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 57 of 70 
generally abide by promises that it makes in such agreements. See, e.g., United States v. Hill, 643 
F.3d 807, 874 (11th Cir. 2011) (analyzing scope of government promises in a plea agreement). 
But as the Eleventh Circuit (and other courts) have made clear, this general rule that the 
Government is bound by plea provisions is subject to qualifications. The key case on this point is 
the Eleventh Circuit's decision in San Pedro v. United States, 79 F.3d 1065 ( I 1th Cir. 1996), cited 
previously by Jane Doe 1 and 2 but not discussed by Epstein. San Pedro explains that: "[T]he 
general rule requiring governmental adherence to promises made during plea negotiations is 
subject to two conditions. First, the agent making the promise must be authorized to do so, and 
second, the defendant must detrimentally rely on the promise. If either condition is lacking, then 
the agreement is unenforceable .. . ." San Pedro v. United States, 79 F.3d 1065, 1068 (11th Cir. 
1996); see also United States v. Kachkar, No. 16-20595-CR, 2018 WL 6974948 at *2 (S.D. Fla. 
2018), report and recommendation adopted, No. 16-20595-CR, 2019 WL 116864 (S.D. Fla. 2019) 
(following San Pedro). 
Here, of course, in adopting the CVRA Congress directed that prosecutors must reasonably 
"confer" with the victim in a criminal case before making a binding resolution. 18 U.S.C. § 
3771 (a)(5). Prosecutors lack authority to deviate from this congressional command — and thus (at 
least on the facts of this case) lacked "actual authority to make" a promise of immunity without 
conferring with victims. San Pedro, 795 F.3d at 1068. The word "authority" means "[t]he official 
right or permission to act, esp. to act legally on another's behalf ...." BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 
158 (10'h ed. 2014) (emphasis added). Here, as the Court has previously found (without challenge 
from Epstein) "once the Government failed to advise the victims about its intention to enter into 
the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred." 359 F.Supp.3d at 1221. In other words, the 
EFTA00021498
--- PAGE 58 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 58 of 70 
Government was no longer acting legally — and simply did not have authority to extend immunity 
to Epstein. 
The facts of San Pedro offer clear parallels to this case. There, the prosecutor offered a 
promise of non-deportation to criminal defendant San Pedro. The Eleventh Circuit concluded that 
this agreement was unenforceable, because by statute the power to enforce immigration laws rested 
with the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Id. (citing 8 U.S.C. § 1103(a)). 
Here, Congress has also placed statutory limitations on the power of prosecutors, 
specifically the USAO-SDFL — requiring it to follow the law. The statute establishing the duties 
of the Office of U.S. Attorney provides that "Wrcept as otherwise provided by law, each United 
States attorney, within his district, shall. . . prosecute for all offenses against the United States .. 
.." 28 U.S. § 547 (emphasis added). Thus, here the USAO-SDFL had authority to make prosecutorial 
decisions about this District but had to proceed as "provided by law." See 28 U.S. § 547. One law — 
the CVRA — required the USAO-SDFL to confer with victims before extending Epstein's immunity 
offer. Because that was not done — a fact that Epstein well knew, and indeed had sought — the USAO-
SDFL was without authority to extend the secret immunity offer. 
The fact that Epstein was represented by a multitude of high-powered lawyers is also relevant. 
"This case does not involve any government overreaching by taking advantage of an unsophisticated 
defendant." United States v. Friedland, 83 F.3d 1531, 1539 (3d Cir. 1996). Instead, Epstein and the 
USAO-SDFL sought to maneuver around the statutory commands of the CVRA. Now that their 
maneuver has failed, Epstein is not entitled to take advantage of his illegal agreement. 
This conclusion follows even if the Court were to proceed on the assumption (contrary to the 
facts of this case) that Epstein's legal team had no knowledge whatsoever that the Government was 
violating its CVRA obligations. A helpful case is United States v. Walker, 98 F.3d 944 (7th Cir. 1996). 
EFTA00021499
--- PAGE 59 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 59 of 70 
There, the Seventh Circuit refused to enforce a provision in a plea agreement where "the parties' 
bargain was founded on a mutual misunderstanding of the legal consequences of the bargain. 
Alternatively and equivalently, it is a case in which the bargain is vitiated by illegality — an attempt to 
attach an unauthorized consequence to an inappropriate order." Id. at 946. Even assuming arguendo 
that this case simply involves Epstein and the USAO-SDFL reaching an agreement based on a "mutual 
misunderstanding," the fact remains that the NPA continues to be "vitiated by illegality" and this Court 
cannot attach any effect to the improper agreement. 
In response to Walker, Epstein calls the Seventh Circuit's ruling an "entirely confused" 
decision. Epstein Remedies Br. at 25. But the Seventh Circuit simply followed standard principles 
that a court must follow the law when interpreting plea agreements. Indeed, numerous cases hold that 
such agreements are unenforceable when they deviate from legal requirements. See, e.g., Craig v. 
People, 986 P.2d 951, 959-60 (Colo. 1999) (court cannot enforce a plea agreement that waives the 
mandatory parole period); State v. Garcia, 582 N.W.2d 879, 881-82 (Minn. 1998) (plea agreement 
promised a sentence that did not contain the statutorily-required 10-year conditional release term); 
State v. Wall, 348 N.C. 671, 675-76 (1998) (holding that court cannot enforce a plea agreement for 
concurrent sentence where law mandated consecutive one); Ex parte Rich, 194 S.W.3d 508, 515 (Tex. 
Crim. App. 2006) (court cannot enforce an illegal sentence below the statutory range); State v. 
Mazzone, 212 W.Va. 368, 374 (2002) (court would not enforce plea agreement that called for court to 
unlawfully sentence the defendant by treating two misdemeanor offenses as felony offenses). 
Epstein acknowledges this long line of cases but claims that they are all distinguishable because 
they stand for the proposition that "a court cannot enforce facially invalid plea agreements that contain 
illegal terms or omit the required components of a sentence." Epstein Remedies Br. at 26. Epstein's 
concession effectively gives away the game. Epstein never explains why the principles expressed in 
EFTA00021500
--- PAGE 60 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 60 of 70 
these cases should be limited to "facially" invalid agreement. Here this Court has held that the NPA 
was reached in violation of congressional command, which equally renders it plainly illegal — and thus 
unenforceable. 
Craig v. People, 986 P.2d 951 (Colo. 1999), for example, explains that when "the parties 
attempt to fashion a sentence that is itself contrary to law, the resulting illegality is not subject to 
specific enforcement." Id. at 959. Here, Epstein and the USAO-SDFL attempted to "fashion" an NPA 
that was "contrary to law"— because it was reached without the congressionally required conferral with 
Epstein's victims. 
Similarly, State v. Wall, 348 N.C. 671 1998), holds that the defendant was not entitled to 
specific performance of a plea agreement to receive a concurrent sentence, because "such action would 
violate the laws of this state." Id. at 676. So too here. To allow Epstein to obtain specific performance 
of the secret NPA would "violate the laws of this" country — i.e., the Crime Victims' Rights Act. 
Directly contrary to Epstein's theory that "facial invalidity" only applies to the specific terms 
of an agreement is Ex parte Rich, 194 S.W.3d 508 (Tex. Crim. App. 2006). There, the Court refused 
specific performance of an illegal arrangement, explaining that "[a]lthough the plea bargain seemed 
fair on its face when executed, it has become unenforceable due to circumstances beyond the control 
of the Applicant or the State, namely the fact that one of the enhancement paragraphs was 
mischaracterized in the indictment, resulting in an illegal sentence far outside the statutory range of 
punishment." Id. at 515. Here, even if it could be argued that the NPA was "fair on its face," the fact 
is that it is now unenforceable due to the fact that the victims were never given their CVRA right to 
confer. Indeed, in Ex pane Rich, the court refused to enforce the plea agreement "due to circumstances 
beyond the control" of the defendant and the State. Id. Here, of course, the resulting "circumstances" 
EFTA00021501
--- PAGE 61 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 61 of 70 
(i.e., non-conferral with the victims) were entirely within the control Epstein and USAO-SDFL — and, 
in fact, were something that they conspired together to achieve. 
Epstein further argues that he should not be held accountable for what he describes as "[t]he 
government's failure to comply with its obligations to third parties." Epstein Remedies Br. at 45. 
The Court would be faced with a more difficult question if Epstein had actually understood that 
the Government was fully complying with its conferral obligations but had simply dropped the 
ball. The situation here is entirely different. It was both the Government and Epstein who worked 
together assiduously to hide the ball from the victims. Against that backdrop, no "inequities" (id.) 
would result from rescinding the NPA's immunity provisions. Epstein chose to arrange for an 
illegal deal — he is not entitled to reap the benefits of that illegality. 
Finally, Epstein also refers to his alleged "full performance" of his obligations under the 
NPA. Id. But that fact has recently been called into doubt by the ruling denying Epstein bail in 
the criminal case proceeding before the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. 
See Decision and Order Remanding Defendant, DE 32 at 19-20, U.S v. Epstein, No. 1:19-cr-490-
RMB (S.D.N.Y. July 18, 2019) (finding that "Mr. Epstein has not always been compliant with his 
legal obligations as a registered sex offender"). As the Court noted there, Epstein's counsel 
claimed that Epstein has been "scrupulously fulfill[ing] his obligations in every jurisdiction in 
which he was required to register [as a sex offender]" since his 2008 Florida convictions." Id. at 
19. But it appears that Epstein has not been compliant, for example, in New York. See id. at 20 
(noting that, notwithstanding a New York judge's order imposing a sex offender reporting 
requirement, according to an investigative report Epstein "has never reported as a sex offender to 
New York law enforcement"); see also id. at 21 (noting lack of information from Epstein's counsel 
EFTA00021502
--- PAGE 62 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 62 of 70 
demonstrating proper sex offender registration in New Mexico, Florida, and the Virgin Islands). 
These facts further undercut any claim by Epstein to being able to rely on the NPA. 
VI. 
SEPARATION OF POWERS DOES NOT PREVENT THE COURT FROM 
EXERCISING ITS STATUTORY POWER TO ENFORCE THE CVRA. 
Intervenor Epstein next argues that the rescission remedy would somehow interfere with 
separation of powers. Epstein Remedies Br. at 46-49. But Epstein lacks standing to assert 
interference with Executive prerogatives. The USAO-SDFL has been actively engaged in this 
litigation and has filed dozens of pleadings. Any issues regarding interference with the Executive 
branch have, no doubt, been properly advanced by that Office — and Epstein is simply an interloper 
who is not free to kibitz on constitutional issues regarding separation of powers. The federal courts 
are "not empowered to seek out and strike down any governmental act that they deem to be 
repugnant to the Constitution. Rather, federal courts sit `solely, to decide on the rights of 
individuals.'" Hein v. Freedom from Religion Found., Inc., 551 U.S. 587, 598 (2007) (Alito, J.) 
(citing Marbwy v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 170, 2 L.Ed. 60 (1803)). Epstein does not have a 
"right" to separation of powers. 
Second, as discussed above in connection with the statutory authority of the U.S. 
Attorney's Offices, Congress is entitled to pass laws establishing rights for crime victims. To our 
knowledge, no litigant — and certainly not Epstein — has ever argued that the CVRA's extension of 
rights to victims unconstitutionally intrudes on executive power. Indeed, this Court has already 
explained why the CVRA does not interfere with prosecutorial discretion: "The Government 
correctly notes that the CVRA provides that InJothing in this chapter shall be construed to impair 
EFTA00021503
--- PAGE 63 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 63 of 70 
the prosecutorial discretion of the Attorney General or any officer under his direction.' 18 U.S.C.A. 
§ 3771(d)(6). The Court is not ruling that the decision not to prosecute was improper. The Court 
is simply ruling that, under the facts of this case, there was a violation of the victims' rights under 
the CVRA." 359 F.Supp.3d at 1222. The Court would say exactly the same thing in providing 
the victims a rescission remedy. The Court would not be ruling that the immunity provisions were 
"improper." The Court would simply say that, under the facts of this case, the provisions have to 
be rescinded because they were adopted in violation of the victims' CVRA rights. 
This Court's ruling to that effect would not "thrust the Court into the role of prosecutor and 
negotiator .. . ." Epstein Remedies Br. at 47. Instead, the Court would simply be performing the 
task that Congress assigned to it by directing that district courts "shall ensure" that victims receive 
their CVRA rights. 18 U.S.C. § 3771(b)(1). Once the immunity provisions have been rescinded, 
the victims would confer with the USAO-SDFL and then the prosecutors would be free to proceed 
as they saw fit. Ensuring that victims receive their procedural CVRA rights in no way intrudes 
on substantive decisions by prosecutors. 
To be sure, judicial authority is limited "when reviewing the Executive's exercise of 
discretion over charging determinations." United States v. Fokker Servs. B. V., 818 F.3d 733, 741 
(D.C. Cir. 2016). But Jane Doe 1 and 2 are not asking this Court to review any prosecutor's 
ultimate charging determination; all the victims seek is that they have their promised opportunity 
to "confer" with the prosecutors about what that determination should be. Thus, in enforcing the 
victims' rights, the Court would not be "rejecting the deal agreed to by the parties." Epstein 
Remedies' Br. at 49. It would simply be enforcing the victims' right to be involved in shaping that 
deal. As this Court has held, "the CVRA was designed to give the victims the same opportunity 
EFTA00021504
--- PAGE 64 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 64 of 70 
to attempt to affect prosecutorial decisions before they became final" as defendants have. 359 
F.Supp.3d at 1221. Enforcing that congressional decision is well within judicial authority. 
VII. 
THE VICTIMS' REQUEST FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF (REMEDY #2) 
IMMEDIATELY BECOMES RIPE UPON THE GRANTING OF A RESCISSION 
(REMEDY #1). 
Intervenor Epstein next argues that, even if the Court grants rescission (remedy #1), it 
would be premature for this Court to rule on whether the Constitution would permit his prosecution 
(remedy #2). Epstein Remedies Br. at 49. Epstein claims that such a ruling is precluded by the 
"ripeness" doctrine, which on closer examination turns out to involve a claim that no "case or 
controversy" would exist for such a determination. Id. at 50. 
If the Court grants rescission (remedy #1), the issue of declaratory relief (remedy #2) 
immediately becomes ripe. Specifically, unless this Court declares that it is permissible for the 
USAO-SDFL to prosecute Epstein, it will not be giving Epstein's victims "the same opportunity 
[as Epstein had] to attempt to affect prosecutorial decisions before they became final." 359 
F.Supp.3d at 1221. See generally Victims' Resp. to Government Remedies Submission at 35-37. 
Without such a declaration, the Jane Does would not be put back in the same position as they 
would have been had the Government complied with the CVRA. 
But, in any event, given the way that briefing has proceeded in this case, this request 
(remedy #2) is now largely subsumed by the way in which Epstein has advanced his arguments 
against rescission. If the Court reviews and rejects all of Epstein's arguments (as we believe it 
should), then the victims would largely receive the declaratory relief that they need. Epstein 
obviously believes that he is entitled to obtain a ruling on all of his constitutional arguments 
advanced here. And Epstein has presented a wide array of constitutional and separation of powers 
EFTA00021505
--- PAGE 65 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 65 of 70 
arguments against the rescission remedy. See, e.g., Epstein Remedies Br. at 14-27 (arguing that 
"procedural due process" precludes rescission); id. at 43-46 (arguing that "substantive due 
process" precludes rescission); id. at 46-49 (arguing that separation of powers precludes 
rescission). A Court ruling that, in spite of these constitutional arguments, rescission is nonetheless 
appropriate would appear to sweep away most of the constitutional bathers that the victims have 
been concerned about. 
Accordingly, for remedy #2, the victims simply ask the Court to reach — and reject — all of 
Epstein's constitutional claims. Following a court decision to that effect, the victims could then 
approach the Court if any constitutional issues remained at that time that were improperly 
impeding their ability to confer. 
VIII. THE COURT IS AUTHORIZED TO HOLD A PUBLIC HEARING WITH THE 
VICTIMS IN THIS CASE. 
Jane Doe 1 and 2 have requested that the Court hold a hearing in this case, at which time 
they could address the Court — and Epstein and prosecutors — about this case. DE 464 at 46-49. 
The Government responded by agreeing that a court hearing was appropriate but suggesting a 
slightly different format than the victims. DE 462 at 7. Jane Doe 1 and 2 have replied to the 
Government, continuing to agree with the Government that a hearing is appropriate but reaffirming 
their request (for example) that Epstein and former-U.S. Attorney Acosta attend the hearing. DE 
464 at 4649.22
Since the filing of that brief by the victims, Secretary Acosta has decided to resign his 
position as Labor Secretary. But during his press conference on July 10 on the topic of the NPA, 
Acosta stated that he might be willing, at some point, to "circle back" with the victims to discuss 
his handling of the case so as to be "more transparent." On July 15, counsel for Jane Doe 1 and 2 
sent a letter to Acosta, advising him of the hearing that the victims and his prior Office was

--- PAGE 66 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 66 of 70 
Now Epstein has weighed in, claiming that the Court has "no authority" under the CVRA 
to preside over such a hearing. But, to the contrary, the CVRA provides enforcement powers to 
district courts to enforce the CVRA. 18 U.S.C. § 3771(b)(1). And contrary to Epstein's 
suggestion, there is clearly a "case or controversy" as to how to best provide the victims their 
CVRA rights. In the unusual circumstances that exist in this case, where even the Government 
concedes no remedy (rescission or otherwise) can fully put the victims back in the position that 
they would have been had the Government properly conferred in 2007, this Court clearly has power 
to act. As Senator Kyl explained, "it is the clear intent and expectation of Congress that the district 
. . . courts will establish procedures that will allow for a prompt adjudication of any issues 
regarding the assertion of a victim's right, while giving meaning to the rights we establish." 150 
Cong. Rec. 22953 (Oct. 9, 2004) (statement of Sen. Kyl) (emphases added). A hearing of the kind 
that the victims — and the Government —propose is an appropriate way to give at least some 
meaning to important CVRA rights. 
IX. 
ADOPTION OF EARLIER PLEADINGS BY REFERENCE 
Jane Doe 1 and 2 have also advanced numerous arguments in other filings that defeat 
Epstein's claims. To avoid duplicative briefing, Jane Doe I adopt by reference, in response to 
Epstein, all of the arguments they have advanced in DE 458 and DE 464. 
X. 
THE COURT SHOULD EXPEDITE ITS RULING ON REMEDIES AND ON THE 
VICTIMS' RIGHTS TO BE TREATED WITH FAIRNESS AND TO NOTICE. 
At this time, all of the briefing that the Court requested in its scheduling order (DE 454) 
has been completed. Accordingly, all the matters discussed in this submission are ripe for decision. 
proposing and asking whether he would voluntarily attend the hearing. Jane Doe I and 2 have yet 
to receive any response to the letter. 
EFTA00021507
--- PAGE 67 ---
Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 466 Entered on FLSD Docket 07/23/2019 Page 67 of 70 
Jane Doe 1 and 2 continue to request a rapid ruling on remedies by this Court.23 Any delay 
in ruling could further compound the damage that has already been done to Epstein's Florida 
victims by denying them an opportunity to meaningfully confer about federal charges being filed 
in this District — particularly given recent and on-going developments in New York that, while 
independent of this case, may make it more difficult for Jane Doe I and 2 to seek prosecution here. 
Jane Doe 1 and 2 also have pending before the Court two additional arguments as why the 
CVRA has been violated — specifically, that their rights to be treated with fairness and to notice 
have been violated. See DE 458 at 33. As previously explained, the Government has not 
challenged that the Court should hold that these two rights have been violated. DE 464 at 15. And, 
likewise, Epstein has not made any argument to the contrary. (He does not even cite the right to 
fairness in his brief.) Accordingly, the Court should summarily find that these rights have also 
been violated. After such a ruling, Jane Doe 1 and 2 would respectfully respect the opportunity to 
provide additional briefing on what additional remedies would then become available to them. 
Their existing briefing on remedies, of course, has been confined to explaining what remedies the 
Court should award based on its existing findings. The Court would have more expansive remedial 
powers based on more expansive findings of CVRA violations. 
To be clear, having previously discussed the issue with the Court and seen the Court's 
approach to resolving the pending issues, Jane Doe I and 2 are not seeking a jury trial on any 
aspect of this case. With regard to crafting remedies for the violation of their right to confer, the 
Court should exercise its remedial power. And with regard to the victims' still-pending claims that 
there has been a violation of their rights to be treated with fairness and to notice, the Court can 
make the necessary factual determinations to decide the matters.

But none of these other possibilities should prevent the Court from moving forward rapidly 
with the issues that are fully briefed and squarely before it now. The victims request that the 
Court rule as rapidly as possible. 
XI. 
REQUEST FOR A HEARING (IF NECESSARY). 
If the Court requires any further factual predicate from Jane Doe 1 and 2 in response to 
Epstein's arguments, they request a hearing and opportunity to provide that predicate to the Court. 
CONCLUSION 
Intervenor Epstein set in motion a plan whereby he joined with the USAO-SDFL to reach 
a secret non-prosecution agreement — and then to have it put it in place without the victims having 
any opportunity to object. That plan to keep the victims in the dark was patently illegal under the 
CVRA. And the plan was in service of keeping a deal secret that could never have survived public 
or judicial scrutiny. 
This Court has now held that the Government's illegal actions, undertaken at Epstein's 
specific request, violated Jane Doe I and 2's rights under the Crime Victims' Rights Act. And the 
Court now possesses ample power to respond to this deliberate attempt to keep innocent victims 
uncertain about why multiple federal sex crimes against them were to go unpunished. The Court 
should accordingly grant Jane Doe 1 and Jane Doe 2 all the remedies they have requested, 
including rescission of the NPA's "immunity" provisions precluding prosecution of Epstein and 
his co-conspirators for federal sex crimes committed in the Southern District of Florida.
